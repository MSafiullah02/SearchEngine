            "text": "The challenge of learning a new concept without receiving any examples beforehand is called zero-shot learning (ZSL). One of the major issues in deep learning based methodologies is the requirement of feeding a vast amount of annotated and labelled images by a human to train the network model. ZSL is known for having minimal human intervention by relying only on previously known concepts and auxiliary information. It is an ever-growing research area since it has human-like characteristics in learning new concepts, which makes it applicable in many real-world scenarios, from autonomous vehicles to surveillance systems to medical imaging and COVID-19 CT scan-based diagnosis. In this paper, we present the definition of the problem, we review over fundamentals, and the challenging steps of Zero-shot learning, including recent categories of solutions, motivations behind each approach, and their advantages over other categories. Inspired from different settings and extensions, we have a broaden solution called one/few-shot learning. We then review thorough datasets, the variety of splits, and the evaluation protocols proposed so far. Finally, we discuss the recent applications and possible future directions of ZSL. We aim to convey a useful intuition through this paper towards the goal of handling computer vision learning tasks more similar to the way humans learn.",

            "text": "Object recognition is one of the highly researched areas of computer vision. Recent recognition models have led to great performance through established techniques and large annotated datasets. To this date, the attention over this topic has not dimmed as there are still ways to refine models by eliminating various issues exist in this area. The number of newly emerging unknown objects are growing. Some examples of these unseen or rarely-previously-seen objects are the next generation of concept cars, futuristic-looking object designs, other existing concepts but with restricted access to them (such as licensed or private medical imag-ing datasets), or rarely seen objects (such a traffic signs with graffiti on them), or fine-grained categories of objects (such as detection of a Caspian tiger comparing to the easier task of detecting a common Bengal tiger). This brings the necessity of developing a fresh way of solving object recognition problems that concern lesser human supervision. Several approaches have tried to gather web images to train the developed deep learning models, but aside from the problem of the noisy images, the keywords are still a form of human supervision. One-Shot learning (OSL) and Few-shot learning (FSL) are two other popular solutions that are able to learn new categories via one or a few images, respectively [1] , [2] , [3] . Then, Zero-shot learning (ZSL) [4] , [5] , [6] , [7] , [8] emerged which is completely free of any laborious task of data collection and annotation by experts. Zero-shot learning is a novel concept learning technique without accessing any exemplars of the unseen categories during training, yet it is able to build recognition models with the help of transferring knowledge from previously seen categories and auxiliary information. One of the interesting facts about ZSL is its similarity with the way human learns a concept without seeing them. This makes it capable of recognizing them later, in case of the appearance. For example, a ZSL-based model would be able to recognize a Persian fallow deer, based on the information available for it and the similarities and differences with other previously known deer. For instance, it belongs to a subgroup of the fallow deer, with a larger body, bigger antlers, white spots around the neck, and also flat antlers for the male type. A similar concept or approach is applicable in autonomous vehicles [9] where a self-driving car is responsible for recognition of a novel unseen Toyota Concept-i car (Figure 1 ) based on the subgroup of classic sedan cars; or COVID-19 patient diagnosis, based on the chest X-ray symptoms from the subgroup of asthma and lungs inflammatory diseases.",

To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to include the evaluation of datasynthesizing methods in the survey of Zero-shot learning alongside other methods.

DSRL [29] uses non-negative sparse matrix factorization to align vector representations with the attribute-based label representation vectors so that more relevant visual features are passed to the semantic space. Some approaches to ZSL use non-linear compatibility functions.

In UDA [21] a non-linear projection from feature space to semantic space (word vector and attribute) is proposed in an unsupervised domain adaptation problem based on regularised sparse coding.

Then it uses them alongside the seen data and projected to the semantic space via a linear mapping. GLaP [17] generates virtual instances of an unseen class with the assumption that each representation obeys a prior distribution where one can draw samples from. To ease the embedding to the semantic space, GANZrl [96] proposes to increase the visual diversity by generating samples with specified semantics using GAN models.

LisGAN [103] generates unseen features from random noises using conditional Wasserstein GANs [104] . For regularization, they introduced semantically meaningful soul samples for each class and forced the generated features to be close to at least one of the soul samples. Gradient Matching Network (GMN) [28] trains an improved version of the conditional WGAN [105] to produce image features for the novel classes. It also introduces Gradient Matching (GM) loss to improve the quality of the synthesized features. In order to synthesize unseen features, SPF-GZSL [106] selects similar instances and combines them to form pseudo features using a centre loss function [107] . In Don't Even Look Once (DELO) [108] a detection algorithm is conducted to synthesize unseen visual features to gain high confidence predictions for unseen concepts while maintaining low confidence for backgrounds with vanilla detectors. Instead of augmenting data using synthesizing methods, data can be acquired by gathering web images. [54] jointly uses web data which are considered weaklysupervised categories alongside the fully-supervised auxiliary labelled categories. It then learns a dictionary for the two categories.",

To solve the problem, proposed splits (PS) is introduced by [121] where no test images are contained in the ImageNet 1K dataset. ImageNet. [121] proposes 9 ZSL splits for the ImageNet dataset; two of which evaluate the semantic hierarchy in distance-wise scales of 2-hops (1509 classes) and 3-hops (7678 classes) from the 1k training classes. The remaining six splits consider the imbalanced size of classes with increasing granularity splits starting from 500, 1K and 5K least-populated classes to 500, 1K and 5K most-populated classes, or All which denotes a subset of 20k other classes for testing. Seen-Unseen relatedness. To measure the relatedness of seen samples to unseen classes, [7] introduces two splits Super-Category-Shared (SCS) and Super-Category-Exclusive (SCE). SCS is the easy split since it considers the relatedness to the parent category while SCE is harder and measures the closeness of an unseen sample to that particular child node. ",

It simply shows the number of occurrences of the words in a representation called bag and is negligent of word orders and grammar. Oneshot encoding approaches had a drawback of giving the stopwords (like \"a\", \"the\" and \"of\") high relevancy counts. Later Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF): [124] used term weighting to alleviate this problem by filtering the stopwords and to keep meaningful words. Word2Vec [125] , a widely used two-layered neural embedding model and is divided into two variants CBOW and skip-gram. CBOW predicts a target word in the centre of a context using its surroundings while the skip-gram model predicts surrounding words using a target word. CBOW is faster in train and usually results in better accuracy for frequent words while Skip-gram is preferred for rare words and it works well with sparse training data. Global Vectors (GloVe) [126] is trained by Wikipedia. It combines local context window methods and global matrix factorization. Glove learns to consider global word-word co-occurrence matrix statistics to build the word embeddings. Word hierarchy embedding. WordNet [120] is a large-scale lexical database of semantical synsets (grouped synonym) of English words that are organized using the hierarchy distances. Approaches based on knowledge graphs often follow the WordNet.",

From the hybrid or combination category, we compare the results of SAE [109] . Three transductive approaches ALE-tran [23] , GFZSL-tran [18] and DSRL [29] are also presented among the selected models. Due to the intrinsic nature of the transductive setting, the results are competitive and in some cases better than the inductive methods, i.e. for GFZSLtran [18] the accuracy is 9.9% higher than CVAE-ZSL [38] for [18] , a compatibility-based approach, has the best scores compared to other models of the same category in every dataset except for the CUB where SJE [5] tops the results in both splits. This superiority could be due to the generative nature of the model. GFZSL [18] performs the best on AWA1 both in inductive and transductive settings. Out of cross-modal methods, SYNC [15] performs better than SSE [14] in SUN and CUB datasets, while for AWA1, AWA2 and aPY in SS split it has lower performance than SSE [14] in the proposed split. Visual generative methods have proved to perform better as they make the problem into the traditional supervised form, among which, SE-ZSL [97] has the most outstanding performance. For the proposed split in one case on CUB dataset, SE-ZSL [97] performs better than ALE-tran [23] which is its transductive counterpart where the accuracies are 59.6% vs 54.5%. In PS split of AWA1, CVAE-ZSL [38] stays at the top, with 1.9% higher accuracy than the second-best performing model.

CADA-VAE [39] is added to the comparison as a model combining the visual feature augmentation approach with the cross-modal alignment. CMT* [71] has a novelty detection and is included in the report as an alternative version to CMT [71] . The reports in Table 4 are in PS splits. As shown in the table, the results on y S are dramatically higher than y U since in GZSL, the test search space includes seen classes as well as unseen classes, this gap is the most conspicuous in attribute classifiers like DAP [4] that performs poorly on AWA1 and AWA2, hybrid approaches and in GFZSL [18] where it results in 0% accuracy on SUN and CUB when training classes are estimated at test time. However for three models f-CLSWGAN [37] , SE-GZSL [97] and CADA-VAE [39] in SUN dataset, the accuracy for y U is higher than y S , i.e. for SE-GZSL [97] it is 10.4% higher. For a fair comparison, the weighted average of training and test classes is also reported. According to harmonic means, the best model on all evaluated datasets is SE-ZSL [97] , although the results haven't been reported for aPY. In some cases, the attribute classifier achieves the best results on y S . Transductive models have fluctuating results in comparison with their inductive types. CADA-VAE [39] achieves the best performance in all of the harmonic means cases (results for aPY are not reported) and shows the best results, higher than all of the transductive methods.",

The first setting has better accuracies on CUB. CANZSL [113] outperforms all other models in both datasets and splits and improves the accuracy by 4% from 10.3% to 14.3% on SCE split of the CUB dataset and 35.6% vs 38.1% in SCS splits of NAB compared to the next best performing model is GAZSL [55] .

All of the Top-1 accuracies, except for the data generating models are reported from [121] experiments. As can be understood from Figure 2a , Feature generating methods have outstanding performance compared to other approaches. Although the results of f-VAEGAN-D2 [19] are available only for 2H, 3H and all splits, it still has the high- SYNC [15] and f-CLSWGAN [37] are the next best performing models with approximately the same accuracies. CONSE [11] is a representative model from attributeclassifier based models, as it is also superior to direct com-patibility approaches. ESZSL [12] , a model with linear compatibility function outperforms the other model within its category. However, in one case, SJE [5] has slightly better accuracy in L500 split setting. It can be interpreted from the figures that on coarse-grained classes, the results are conspicuously better, while fine-grained classes with few images per class have more challenges. However, if the test search space is too big then the accuracies decrease. i.e. M5K has lower accuracies compared to L500 splits, and on 20K split, it is the lowest.",

[37] generates semantically rich CNN features of the unseen classes to make unseen embedding space more known. [38] generates pseudo seen and unseen class features, and then it trains an SVM classifier to mitigate bias. [28] improves the quality of the synthesized examples by using gradient matching loss. Models combining data generation or reconstruction along with other techniques have proved to be effective in alleviating bias.

A considerable amount of works has been done through a transductive setting which has been successful to overcome the domain-shift issue. [22] a multiview embedding framework, performs label propagation on graph a heuristic one-stage self-learning approach to assign points to their nearest data points. [21] introduces a regularized sparse coding based unsupervised domain adaptation framework that solves the domain shift problem. [136] uses a structured prediction method to solve the problem by visually clustering the unseen data. [27] uses a visual constraint on the centre of each class when the mapping is being learned. Since the pure definition of the ZSL challenge is the inaccessibility of unseen data during training, several inductive approaches tried to solve the problem as well. [109] proposes to reconstruct the visual features to alleviate this issue. [29] performs sparse non-negative matrix factorization for both domains in a common semantic dictionary. MFMR [31] exploits the manifold structure of test data with a joint prediction scheme to avoid domain shift. [81] uses entropy minimization in optimization.

Attribute classifiers are considered customized since humanannotations are used; however, this makes the problem a laborious task that has strong supervision. Compatibility learning approaches have the ability to learn directly by eliminating the intermediate step but often face with the bias and hubness problem. Manifold learning solves this weakness of the semantic learning approaches by preserving the geometrical structure of the features. Cross-modal latent embedding approaches take on a different point of view and leverage both visual and semantic features and the similarity and differences between them. They often propose methods for aligning the structures between the two modes of features. This category of methods also suffers from the hubness problem for the problems dealing with high-dimensional data. Visual space embedding approaches have the advantage of turning the problem into a supervised one by generating or aggregating visual instances for the unseen classes. Plus are a favourable approach for solving hubness problem due to the highdimensionality of the visual space that can preserve information structure better and also bias problem by alleviating the imbalanced data by generating unseen class samples. Here a challenge would be generating more realistic looking data. Another different setting is transductive learning that present solutions to bias problem, by creating balance in data by gathering unseen data, yet not applicable to many of the real-world problems since the original definition of ZSL limits the use of unseen data during the training phase.",

The number of applications for the task of learning without access to the unseen target concepts is increasing with each year. A very recent and global challenge of COVID-19 diagnose and recognition is a perfect real-world application of Zeroshot learning, where we do not have millions of annotated datasets available; and the symptoms of the disease and the chest x-ray of infected people may also vary from person to person. This is considered as a novel unseen target. We only know that symptoms of the infected people with COVID-19 and their chest X-ray images have partial similarities with other lung inflammatory diseases, such as asthma. So, we have to seek for a semantic relationship between training and the new unseen classes. Therefore, ZSL can help us significantly to cope with this new challenge.",

            "text": "Zero-shot learning is widely discussed in the computer vision area. Object recognition in general and for any applications, such as in [140] and [141] aims to locate the objects besides recognising them; several ZSL models are proposed for this purpose; i.e. [142] , [143] and [144] . Zero-shot emotion recognition [145] has the task of recognizing unseen emotions while zero-shot semantic segmentation aims to segment the unseen object categories [146] and [147] . Moreover, on the task of retrieving images from large scale set of data, Zero-shot has a growing number of research [148] [149] along with sketch-based image retrieval systems [150] , [151] and [152] . Zero-shot learning has an application on visual imitation learning to reduce human supervision by automating the exploration of the agent [153] , [154] . Action recognition is the task of recognizing the sequence of actions from the frames of a video. However, if the new actions are not available when training, Zero-shot learning can be a solution, such as in [155] , [156] , [157] and [158] . Zero-shot Style Transfer in an image is the problem of transferring the texture of source image to target image while the style is not pre-determined and it is arbitrary [159] . Zero-shot resolution enhancement problem aims at enhancing the resolution of an image without pre-defined high-resolution images for training examples [160] . Zero-shot scene classification for HSR images [161] and scene-sketch classification has been studied in [162] as other applications of ZSL in computer vision. Zero-shot learning has also left its footprint in the area of NLP. Zero-Shot Entity Linking, links entity mentions in the text using a knowledge base [163] . Many research works focus on the task of translating languages to another without pre-determined translation between pairs of samples [164] , [165] , [166] , [167] . In sentence embedding [168] and in Style transfer of text, a common technique is to convert the source to another style via arbitrary styles like the artistic technique discussed in [169] . In the audio processing field, zero-shot based voice conversion to another speaker's voice [170] is an applicable scenario of ZSL.",
