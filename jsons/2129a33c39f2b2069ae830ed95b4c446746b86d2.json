Since controlled production of DAMPs and SAMPs is needed to achieve full homeostatic restoration and repair from tissue injury, only their pathological, not their homeostatic, concentrations should be therapeutically tackled. Therefore, distinct caveats are proposed regarding choosing DAMPs and SAMPs for therapeutic purposes. For example, we discuss the need to a priori identify and define a context-dependent \"homeostatic DAMP:SAMP ratio\" in each case and a \"homeostatic window\" of DAMP and SAMP concentrations to guarantee a safe treatment modality to patients. Finally, a few clinical examples of how DAMPs and SAMPs might be used as therapeutic targets or therapeutics in the future are discussed, including inhibition of DAMPs in hyperinflammatory processes (e.g., systemic inflammatory response syndrome, as currently observed in Covid-19), administration of SAMPs in chronic inflammatory diseases, inhibition of SAMPs in hyperresolving processes (e.g., compensatory antiinflammatory response syndrome), and administration/induction of DAMPs in vaccination procedures and anti-cancer therapy.",

            "text": "Twenty-six years ago, the danger/injury model in immunology was formulated and published, holding that the immune system does not care about \"self\" and \"non-self,\" but that it is any form of cell stress/tissue injury, rather than the presence of a non-self (i.e., genetically foreign entitied) that induces immunity [1, 2] . The core of the danger/injury model refers to the generation of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), a term coined by Land [3] , also denoted as \"danger signals\" in the international literature. Current notions hold that all organisms on our planet use DAMPs for their defense against any cell stress and tissue injury [4] . Indeed, the evolutionarily determined function of DAMPs is to promote injury-induced defense responses, the aim always being to repair damaged tissue-that is, to restore homeostasis. Unique germline-encoded endogenous molecules accomplish this goal by promoting contextdependent proinflammatory responses, which transition into inflammation-resolving pathways that are driven by suppressing/inhibiting DAMPs (SAMPs), a term coined by Land [5, 6] for molecules counteracting DAMPs. Moreover, in the presence of altered-self or non-self antigens, the DAMPs shape adaptive immune responses that have the same homeostasis-restoring aim.",

Consequently, these molecules are now considered valuable diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in human disorders [5, [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Moreover, the pathogenetic involvement of these molecules qualifies them as relevant drug targets or therapeutics as well.

As comprehensively reviewed [5] , all possible tools of the innate immune system, involving PRR-triggered, proinflammatory cellular, humoral, and molecular pathways, can get activated by DAMPs, in the case of an infectious injury together with microbeassociated molecular patterns (MAMPs), also called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Secretion by DAMP-activated cells of cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules, associated with leukocyte recruitment/infiltration are among the most prominent features of this inflammatory scenario.

Moreover, SPMs have been demonstrated to decrease excessive oxidative stress [35] , to augment bacteria killing by phagocytes, to act at both the transcriptional and translational level, and to shorten time to resolution, via activation of endogenous therapeutically administered when enhancement of adaptive immune responses, such as antitumor immune responses [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] , are desired.",

Such a \"homeostatic DAMP:SAMP ratio\" may also be called a \"homeostatic DAMP:SAMP signature,\" which is required to achieve successful wound healing upon injury without further complications. According to such a model, injury-induced DAMPs are dominating during the initial proinflammatory phase, reflecting a DAMP:SAMP ratio greater than 1 (> 1). Via an intermediate ratio of \u00b1 1, the DAMP:SAMP ratio then inverses during the resolving phase to less than 1 (< 1), and the restitutio ad integrum is finally marked by \"1\" (the \"homeostatic set point\") ( Fig. 1 ). This is complicated by the fact that usually several key DAMPs and SAMPs are acting in a given inflammatory response (which may be called a \"homeostatic DAMP:SAMP pattern ratio\"). Hence, in this situation, the course of the blood levels for each molecule during the inflammatory phase and the resolving phase must be determined to calculate the ratio.",

Druggability is the property of a molecule (i.e., a biological target such as a protein or nucleic acid) that elicits a favorable clinical response when it contacts a drug or a drug-like compound. Drug targets should possess specific properties, including (1) binding with high affinity to a drug that must alter the function of the target, with a therapeutic benefit to the patient; (2) differential expression across the body for specific targeting; (3) the quality of a biomarker to monitor its efficacy; and (4) freedom to operate, that is, a lack of competitive binding [55] [56] [57] [58] . Obviously, DAMPs fulfill these criteria. The idea of choosing DAMPs, for example, HMGB1, as a therapeutic target to inhibit innate immune responses with the use of mAbs or biologicals has already been proposed by Land [59] . Today, several strategies are being discussed and applied to prevent release of DAMPs or to inhibit their activities. Such therapeutic maneuvers are worth considering in, for example, hyperinflammation (e.g., SIRS, as currently observed in Covid-19) and certain chronic inflammatory/ autoimmune diseases. Current pharmacological strategies include the use of mAbs, peptides, decoy receptors, and small molecules, but also absorption/adsorption procedures [60] . For example, plasma adsorption therapy was recently reported to adsorb HMGB1 efficiently [31] . In addition, as also discussed by Venereau et al. [61] and VanPatten and Al-Abed [62] , in the future, the development of specific HMGB1 inhibitors, such as specific small molecules, may potentiate and fine-tune the pharmacological control of inflammation.",

In principle, potential therapeutics include adenosine, AnxA1, and SPMs, but also SPM derivatives, other synthetic small molecule agonists of SPM receptors, inhibitors of SPM-degrading enzymes (e.g., soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitors), and modifiers of the SPM synthesis pathways. With the indications mentioned, SPMs have already been proven to have potent proresolving actions in a range of disease models. Given their potency, many drug development opportunities are possible. As outlined by Serhan [64] , aspirin and statins have a positive impact on these resolution pathways, producing epimeric forms of specific SPMs, whereas other drugs can disrupt timely resolution. As further outlined by this investigator [64] , evidence from recent human and preclinical animal studies indicates that SPMs are physiological mediators and pharmacological agonists that stimulate resolution of inflammation and infection. This observation is reason enough to use them clinically as inhibitors and antagonists alone, and to develop immunoresolvents as agonists to test resolution pharmacology and their role in catabasis for their therapeutic potential [64] . Dalli [65] argues similarly regarding the potential of resolution pharmacology-based approaches in developing new therapeutics for combating infections that do not interfere with the immune response. This issue is also raised by Schett and Neurath [66] , who discuss potential intervention strategies for fostering the resolution process and the implications for the therapy of inflammatory diseases. Indeed, given the new concept of inflammation resolution as an essential part of inflammation biology and pathology, the development of SAMPs for clinical use is a dictate of the hour. As stated by Serhan in this context [67] , \"The available evidence from extensive preclinical animal models, human SPM production in vivo, and the limited results of randomized clinical trials in humans suggest that it is indeed time to consider stimulating resolution in the twentyfirst century as a new therapeutic direction for managing unwanted excessive inflammation and infection. Proresolution pharmacology can enhance the host innate response to expedite microbial clearance, limit collateral tissue damage, and stimulate tissue regeneration by enhancing endogenous resolution mechanisms that are programmed into the resolving exudates of the acute inflammatory response.\" Indeed, not only SPMs but also other SAMPs could stimulate the development of novel therapeutic strategies, encompassing a novel \"resolution pharmacology\" approach.",

Aluminum hydroxide (alum) is the most common adjuvant currently in clinical use [69, 70] that has been denoted as an exogenous DAMP [5] . Of note, in studies in mice, alum was found to cause cell death associated with the subsequent release of host cell DNA identified by the authors as a DAMP [71] .

Fired by the danger/injury model in immunology [1, 2, [73] [74] [75] [76] , a conceptual revolution in oncology has emerged in that cancer is considered to be entities that can be detected and destroyed by the immune system under certain circumstances. The core of this new concept refers to the phenomenon of ICD. Of note, however, only a few lethal stimuli are intrinsically endowed with the ability to instigate ICD, including certain chemotherapeutics, radiotherapy, certain oncolytic viruses, and photodynamic therapy [77] . They are called \"ICD inducers\" [78] . There is accumulating evidence indicating that these therapeutic inducers cause ICD through endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress associated with or induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) [79] . Typically, ICD is associated with the emission of a series of DAMPs that are generated in a precise spatiotemporally defined configuration. This coordinated emission of DAMPs then allows elicitation of a robust antitumor immune response that is associated with the establishment of immunological memory.",

Nevertheless, to implement these tasks clinically in the future, agonists to these molecules have to be developed, some are already available. For example, as reviewed by Venereau et al. [61] and Andersson et al. [15] , there are reports from preclinical studies on the successful use of polyclonal or mouse/rat anti-HMGB1 mAbs in a number of experimental inflammatory models. To enable development of HMGB1-targeted therapy for clinical use, humanized anti-HMGB1 mAbs have been designed, for example, a partly humanized, chimeric mAb targeting HMGB1 with preserved functionality compared to the parental mouse anti-HMGB1 mAb [80] . Thus, removing or neutralizing extracellular HMGB1 in infectious or sterile inflammation would be a plausible approach to ameliorate the human diseases concerned. However, up to now, there has only been limited clinical evidence for therapeutic agents that target extracellular HMGB1, but several promising candidates are in preclinical or clinical development. As concluded by Andersson et al. [15] , \"Blocking excessive amounts of extracellular HMGB1, particularly the disulfide isoform, offers an attractive clinical opportunity to ameliorate systemic inflammatory diseases. Therapeutic interventions to regulate intracellular HMGB1 biology must still await a deeper understanding of intracellular HMGB1 functions. Future work is needed to create more robust assays to evaluate functional bioactivity of HMGB1 antagonists. Forthcoming clinical studies would also greatly benefit from a development of antibodybased assays to quantify HMGB1 redox isoforms, presently assessed by mass spectrometry methods\u2026. Together, we believe that HMGB1-specific antagonists should be tested in multiple parallel clinical studies of inflammatory disease syndromes to reveal whether blocking extracellular HMGB1 will benefit patients.\"",

On the DAMP side, key molecules such as HMGB1, circulating free DNA, S100 proteins, and extracellular histones appear to be the first choice; on the SAMP side, the most studied SPMs are obviously the best candidates. Sophisticated clinical trials focused on specific diseases will have to be designed and conducted to gain sufficient knowledge regarding the key DAMPs and SAMPs involved in any given disease, allowing subsequent calculation of a ratio useful for therapeutic considerations.",

Taking 4 ng/mL as the homeostatic \"1,\" the DAMP increased by 100 in SIRS. On the other hand, as shown in other sets of studies on surviving sepsis patients, the plasma level of the SAMP LXA4 decreased to ~ 149 ng/mL, compared to homeostatic LXA4 levels in controls of ~ 277 ng/ mL (see [82] ). Taking 277 ng/mL as the homeostatic \"1,\" this SAMP decreased by 0.53.

As a therapeutic consequence, such data would be in favor of blocking this DAMP or substituting this SAMP, or even both.

Thus, strikingly, the environment has now been recognized to be the major contributor to the global disease burden [95, 96] . Notably, 80-85% of human disease is reportedly linked to environmental exposures [97] . However, quantifying and specifying the myriad of environmental and lifestyle risk factors such as smoking, exposure to hazardous chemicals, and pathogenic microorganisms turned out to be very complex and difficult to manage [95, 98] . For example, persons can be exposed to a complex mixture of chemical and biological contaminants, with multiple sources, for varying durations across their life course.",

This approach tries to integrate the knowledge of exposures and environmental health sciences by exploring the causal links between environmental exposure and adverse disease effects. Two prominent models emerged as a result of intense interdisciplinary discussions on the environmental health paradigm, called the exposome and the adverse outcome pathway concepts. The model of the environmental health paradigm-academically covered by the new field of exposure science [100] -has worldwide intensified efforts of modern environmental research to study the adverse effects of environmental agents on humans and animals. The main subject of such cross-disciplinary studies is the search for new tools to specify and assess the risk of adverse health outcomes caused by harmful environmental factors. Indeed, the field of environmental research is flourishing, as reflected by the establishment of an interdisciplinary area of environmental health sciences and public health.",

Though not perfect, such an approach should represent a first step to integrate these unique molecules and their pathology-mediating functions into these two environmental health research paradigms. This momentum may give rise to an interesting tautological discussion on whether research on exogenous/endogenous DAMP-induced innate immune pathways and DAMP-shaped adaptive immune processes is just a specialised part of environmental health research or even the same topic! The final future aim of this approach certainly is to develop innovative DAMPbased in vitro tests for cumulative risk assessment, thereby allowing avoidance of the use of costly and (potentially) ethically flawed animal experiments.",
