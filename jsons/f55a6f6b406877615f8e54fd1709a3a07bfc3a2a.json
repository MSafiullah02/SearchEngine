In our former work, the effects of the air cleaner on removing the uniformly distributed particles were numerically investigated. Based on those results, this work further explores the performances of the air cleaner in the reduction of two nonuniform particle distributions generated by smoking and coughing. The Lagrangian discrete trajectory model combined with the Eulerian fluid method is employed to simulate the airflow pattern and particle transport in a room. In general, the results show that the particle fates have been resulted from the interaction between the emitting source and the air cleaner. And the position of the air cleaner is a key parameter affecting the particle concentration, for which a shorter distance between the air cleaner and the human body corresponds to a lower concentration. Besides, the air velocity emitted from the human mouth and the orientation of the air cleaner can also influence the transport of particles.",

            "text": "In order to reduce the indoor air pollution, more and more air cleaners are used. Obviously, the particle concentration of indoor air is determined by both conditions of the particles (e.g. particle quantity, particle distribution, etc.) and the air cleaner (e.g. location, airflow rate, flow direction, etc.), which are the source and sink of particles, respectively. Quite a few studies have been carried out to evaluate the performance of the air cleaner (Nelson et al. 1993; Ongwandee and Kruewan 2013; Ardkapan et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2010; Kang et al. 2008; Chen et al. 2010; Jin et al. 2015; Qian et al. 2010) . The investigations indicate that the position of the air cleaner is a key parameter, which influences the airflow patterns and leads to different removal efficiencies (Zhang et al. 2010 ). According to (Kang et al. 2008) , the air cleaner positioning may cause up to threefold difference in effectiveness. Besides, the direction of airflow ejection is another key parameter for aerosol dispersion control (Chen et al. 2010) . In order to have a comprehensive understanding of the key influencing parameters, Jin et al. (2015) numerically analyzed the effects of the position, flow rate and air ejection direction of an air cleaner on the particle transport characteristics. It was found that the flow rate of the air cleaner is a key parameter affecting the particle concentration. The location of the air cleaner plays a significant role only when the volumetric flow rates are low. Horizontal and upward ejections of the air cleaner have little difference in the removing airborne particles, while they are superior to the downward ejection.",

            "text": "Due to the heavy haze pollution in China, most of residents tend to close windows to restrain the outdoor particles entering into the room. However, the particles generated by coughing and smoking in the indoor environment can also pose threat to human health. In this case, more and more air cleaners are employed to enhance the indoor air quality. To study the transport characteristics of the nonuniformly distributed particles, caused by smoking or coughing indoors and expected to be removed by an air cleaner, a full-scale room is selected. For a typical apartment, the chair or sofa is usually placed adjacent to the wall. And most of time, people sits on a chair or sofa to rest. To mimic this scenario, the human model was placed against the wall with a sitting posture. Besides, the air cleaner is also usually placed next to the wall so as not to affect human activities. As shown in Fig. 1 (a), the height (H), width (W) and length (L) of the room are 2.7 m, 3.2 m and 4 m, respectively. One manikin is assumed to sit at the center of the east wall of the room, whose head and mouth are simplified as a sphere with a diameter of 20 cm and a cycle with a diameter of 2 cm, respectively. Three to-be-evaluated positions of the air cleaner are illustrated in Figs. 1(a) and (b). Position-1 is symmetrical about the middle line in the x-z plane. In position-2, the distance between the west wall of the room and the west side of the air cleaner is 0.5 m. The distance between the east wall of the air cleaner in position-2 and the west wall of the air cleaner in position-3 is 1 m. Figure 1 (c) shows the cabinet type of air cleaner used in households with overall dimensions of height \u00d7 width \u00d7 length = 1.3 m \u00d7 0.3 m \u00d7 0.6 m. The dimensions of the air intake and outlet are 0.6 m \u00d7 0.5 m and 0.6 m \u00d7 0.3 m, respectively. As for the Fig. 1(d) , i.e., upward, horizontal and downward, the downward ejection was found to be much less efficient for removing particles as compared with the horizontal and upward ejections (Jin et al. 2015) . Besides, the differences between the horizontal and upward ejections are generally insignificant, therefore, only the horizontal ejection is studied in this work. It is well known that the temperature of the burning cigarette is significantly higher than the ambient environment, which induces a strong buoyancy effect to transport particles upward. During the process of smoking, however, most of the particles are absorbed into the human body and exhaled from the mouth. The amount of particles directly emitted from burning cigarette is comparatively lower. Therefore, we mainly focus on the dispersion of particles exhaled from human mouth in this study. And the smoking process is treated similar to the respiration activity. According to (H\u00f6rschler et al. 2010) , the periodic respiration could be simplified as a steady exhalation activity. Therefore, a constant exhalation rate of 1.4 m 3 /h is applied for the human mouth, which is equivalent to a mean velocity during exhalation process. In contrast, the velocity of cough process is much larger, which is assumed to be 20 m/s according to (Zhao et al. 2005) . It should be noted that the time of smoking a cigarette may last for a few minutes and most people cough more than once in a cycle of coughing. Therefore, the simulation of the complete process of smoking or coughing may be computational expense and time consuming. In order to simplify the prediction, we only consider smoking process for 5 s and coughing for 0.5 s, which is longer enough to capture the main features of particle transport (Zhao et al. 2005) . The time step for calculating the fates of particles is taken as 0.01 s as recommended in (ANSYS 2009), which is small enough to capture the particle transport characteristics.",

However, the air cleaners cannot effectively remove the submicron particles and the escape phenomena are significant, which will be investigated in our future work. For the popular air cleaners in the Chinese market, the typical CADR value ranges from 100 to 600 m 3 /h. For example, the air cleaner made by Blueair Company (product model Blueair-303) has a CADR of nearly 300 m 3 /h and the geometry is 0.25 m \u00d7 0.44 m \u00d7 0.635 m (length \u00d7 width \u00d7 height), representing a relatively smaller category. While the air cleaner developed by SAMSUNG Company (product model KJ720F-K7586WF) has a CADR of as high as 720 m 3 /h and the dimension is 0.28 m \u00d7 0.36 m \u00d7 1.2 m (length \u00d7 width \u00d7 height). In this study, the size of the air cleaner is close to that of the SAMSUNG product. As for the CADR value, on one hand, three different values of 260 m 3 /h, 520 m 3 /h and 970 m 3 /h were studied in our previous work (Jin et al. 2015) , which found that the average suspended particle concentration could be reduced much faster by using a larger flow rate. On the other hand, the typical flow rate of air cleaners ranges within 600 m 3 /h. Based on these two considerations, the flow rate of 520 m 3 /h is investigated in this study, which is large enough to ensure a relatively well air mixing condition of the indoor environment.",

A constant temperature of 304 K is set to the human body, which is recommended by (Gao and Niu 2004) and the temperature of the room environment is 298 K. Adiabatic boundary conditions are used for the surfaces of the chair and room. For the air cleaner, the rated power is less than 100 W as illustrated in many product introductions. Even one third of the power is converted into heat, the heat release of the air cleaner is about 30 W, which is smaller than the heat release of human body of about 100W. Besides, the air velocities near the inlet and outlet of the air cleaner are approximate 1 m/s. These airflows significantly disturb the flow field and abate the influence of convection boundary layer of the air cleaner. In order to quantify the influence of heat release from the air cleaner, a simulation is conducted and the thermal boundary of air cleaner is set to 30 W.

(6) and (7), so that the particles are tracked in the modified airflow field. The stochastic tracking model (DRW) was used to predict the influence of turbulence on particle dispersion and 5 simulation runs were conducted for each case to eliminate the effect of randomness. The mean value of the 5 runs was applied to represent the transport characteristics of particles. For the sake of computational cost and accuracy, the grid independence tests were carried out for several positions of air cleaner. Three numbers of cells namely 0.4M (case-1), 1.2M (case-2) and 2.0M (case-3) are adopted to check the mesh independence. Figure 3 shows the velocity magnitude at the line-1 (refer to Fig. 1(b) ) when the air cleaner locates at position-1. The velocity of case-2 varies little from that of case-3, therefore the 1.2M cells is applied in the simulation. For all the three positions, the particle number decreases when the running time of the air cleaner increases. Since the distances between the air cleaner and the human body are in the order of position-1> position-2> position-3, it is clear that the shorter the distance, the faster the reduction of the particle concentration. In detail, the number of the suspended particles in the case of position-1 is conspicuously larger than the other two cases during most part of the statistic time except for the initial stage (within ~40 s). Also, when the air cleaner is placed at position-3, which is the nearest position to the human body, the number of suspended particles decreases much quicker than that in the other two positions. It should be noted that the particle concentrations have been conspicuously reduced during 0-900s. Then the air cleaner can be manually or automatically switched to a smaller CADR value to maintain the particle concentration at a lower level and reduce the energy consumption. This kind of operation strategy is widely adopted by commercial air cleaners.",

One of the vortices generates near the floor and the sitting man, which can be attributed to the combined effects of the buoyancy force and the flow ejected from the air cleaner. In addition, the air current exhaled from the human mouth bends towards the body, under the effect of the air cleaner, inducing the particles of smoking cluster around the body at the initial stage. As for the draft generated by the air cleaner, it will influence the thermal comfort of human body. For the three positions investigated in this study, position-1 is right in front of the human body, which might have a severe thermal comfort problem.

Since the airflow from the air cleaner blows directly to the human, it causes many particles to gather around the human body and increase the probability of particle collision with the body surfaces. As a result, a large number of particles deposit on the human body (refer to Table 1), and the number of suspended particles is lower at the initial period of statistic time.

This discrepancy has been associated with the airflow patterns as mentioned before. Besides, the number of particles intaked by the air cleaner at position-1 is also the highest, which may reasonably be attributed to the face-to-face layout of the air cleaner and the human. For position-3, the total number of the eliminated particles (deposit + intake) is the highest, of which the number of deposited particles is also the highest, while the number of intake is the lowest.

In this scenario, the position of the air cleaner plays an important role to determine the indoor particle concentration. The shorter the distance between the air cleaner and the smoking man is, the lower the particle concentration exhibits in the room. On the other hand, the orientation of the air cleaner also has impact on its performance. More particles are removed by the air cleaner when it is placed at position-1, which corresponds to a face-to-face layout.",

Moreover, when the air cleaner is placed opposite to the human, the particles of coughing tend to join the main flow of the circulating airflow of the air cleaner, and consequently may be removed by the air cleaner with higher possibility.",
