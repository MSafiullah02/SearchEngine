Man has taken the automaticity of breathing for granted, expecting its adequacy for all activities whether awake or asleep. Dickinson W. Richards, MD, Nobel Laureate, said in 1962: \u201cBreathing is that essential physiologic function that is straddled between the conscious & the unconscious and subject to both\u201d [2]. The understanding of the components of this critical physiologic function that starts at birth, and must be continuous and widely adaptable to support all levels of physical, metabolic, and functional needs, has evolved slowly over the millennia by many brilliant scientists from a combination of keen observation, imagination, daring experimentation, trial and error, and necessity, while overcoming dogma, religious inhibitions and politics. It is this gradual chronologic process, still evolving, which guides what we do for patients today.",

All normal breathing is by negative pressure, accomplished by the development of negative intrathoracic, or below atmospheric pressure, when the inspiratory muscles contract, predominantly through diaphragmatic descent, distending the rib cage, thus allowing the pressure gradient from the higher atmospheric pressure to cause air to flow through open airways into the elastic lungs and chest wall. Simply relaxing these muscles allows for recoil of the lungs and chest wall to effect exhalation until higher workloads require the recruitment of additional muscles. It took hundreds of years to learn to recognize and understand this.",

In 570 BC a Greek physician, Anaximenes, emphasized that the essence of all life was \u201cpneuma\u201d or breath [6]. Hippocrates (460\u2212375 BC) wrote the first directions for intubation in \u201cTreatise on Air\u201d by placing a \u201ccannula into the trachea along the jaw bone so that air can be drawn into the lungs [7].\u201d However, it was Claudius Galen, a physician, in 128 AD, who followed on this by experimentation by breathing into a hollow reed placed in the throats of many different animals, and noted that their chests expanded. Human experimentation was strictly, legally forbidden. In 160 AD, as the physician to the gladiators in the arena, Galen was the first to conclude that the head controlled breathing when he observed that those gladiators who had their heads cut off at the neck ceased breathing immediately and those injured below the neck continued to breathe [8]. His scientific studies through careful dissection in animals became the basis, the \u201cBible,\u201d for the practice of medicine. He assumed that the anatomy of pigs, apes, dogs, and oxen were the same as in humans. His doctrines were considered so sacrosanct and inviolate by the clergy that their contradiction was punishable by death. This greatly inhibited studies in humans and severely limited the growth of knowledge about breathing in man.",

            "text": "It took more than another thousand years, in 1543, for Andreas Vesalius, a Dutch physician, to dare to do studies in humans. He was a meticulous physician who secretly performed detailed human dissections, despite the church\u2019s prohibitions. This massive work led to his appointment as Professor of Anatomy in Padua at age 23. He was the first to successfully resuscitate a drowning victim by \u201cplacing a tube in his throat & bringing him back to life with a return of a pulse.\u201d Previous experimenters found in opening the chest that this caused the lungs to collapse, and was always associated with cessation of heart beats and death. He observed when he opened the chest of animals that \u201cwhen the lung \u2026collapsed, the beat of the heart and arteries appear wavy, creepy, twisting; but when the lung is inflated at intervals, the motion of the heart and arteries \u2026\u201d resumed, the first description of ventricular fibrillation restored to a regular rhythm with the use of intermittent positive pressure breathing (IPPB). He did this by placing a tube through an \u201copening\u201d in the trachea of a pig through which he could blow which caused the lung to \u201crise\u201d and \u201crestore the animal.\u201d This concept of positive pressure breathing lasts to the 21st century, intermittently abandoned, then resurrected. Vesalius stole the body of a criminal, boiled it, and thus acquired the first complete human skeleton. When he was not yet 29-years old, his seven volume book, de Humani Corporis Fabrica, printed in 1555, beautifully illustrated by a pupil of Titan, detailed correct human anatomy for the first time, contradicting Galen\u2019s work. This was considered heretical, creating professional and theological storms. The story is told that Vesalius performed an autopsy on a Spanish nobleman and observed that his \u201cheart started to beat again\u201d after he inflated his lungs through a tube placed into the trachea. This, along with his contradicting work, earned him the designation of heretic. Since the Pope had decreed that a heretic was guilty of a form of \u201cspiritual treason\u201d when a system of fines and exile was replaced by execution since 1200, a declared heretic was in mortal danger.It was only because of the wealth of his father and his connections to Charles V, Emperor of Spain and the Netherlands, that he was condemned to a \u201cpilgrimage to the Holy Land\u201d rather than execution. It was on this pilgrimage that his brilliant and audacious career ended in his premature death in a ship wreck off Greece on the Ionian island of Zante. Since the clergy were often the only educated, literate people throughout the middle-ages, their dictums were law. Anyone could be accused of being a traitor who was then summoned before a tribunal, \u201cper inquisitionem,\u201d where there was little recourse for self-defense, and sentencing decided. This period, The Inquisition, lasted 800 years, from 1000 to 1800, when countless people were executed, including Joan of Arc, who was executed after torture for heresy in 1431 [9]. This prolonged period dominated by fanatical ignorance with the mortal threat it imposed benefited the clergy and the monarchy both politically and financially and dramatically impeded medical progress [9]. \n",

The Humane Society recommended blowing tobacco smoke into the \u201cgreat bowel\u201d as an \u201caccessory means\u201d to aid resuscitation. When insufficient persons or lack of any implement to blow tobacco smoke were available, induction of vomiting with emetics, pouring warmed wine down the throat, or inducing sneezing with \u201cspirits of quick lime\u201d on a rag placed under the nose were also recommended and practiced with no beneficial outcome. Venesection was promoted as \u201cparticularly necessary\u201d if any life returned. Since such accidents occurred ubiquitously, similar Humane Societies were formed in England and other European countries using some combinations of effective and useless techniques [17]. The choice of mouth to mouth or bellows varied by their local popularity or by individual practitioners in the absence of controlled trials.",

It was thought that more oxygen could be given by the bellows than by mouth-to-mouth attempts. It was the combined work of Joseph Black, isolating carbon dioxide in 1757, Henry Cavendish, isolating hydrogen in 1766 AD, and Daniel Rutherford, isolating nitrogen in 1772 that facilitated the French chemist, Antoine Laurent-Lavoisier, to name the gas Oxygen. Born an aristocrat of independent means, and intensely dedicated to studying respiratory physiology, Lavoisier with Pierre Simon Laplace, in 1780, discovered that the nature of respiration was a process of combustion where oxygen is used and carbon dioxide and water produced. This concept also led Lavoisier to work on public health for the poor because he found the air unclean where they lived. The French Revolution was in full force and for his aristocratic connections and his investment interests his career was cut short by the guillotine. He was labeled \u201can enemy of the people\u201d in part because his chemistry lab was supported by the King [18]. His work fostered the use of oxygen in resuscitation [19]. \n",

The addition of oxygen to mechanical bellows resuscitation was expanded by its promotion by an Englishman, Edmund Goodwyn, MD. He was given a Gold Medal for his acclaimed dissertation \u201cThe Connexion of Life and Respiration: On an Experimental Injury Into the Effects on Submersion, Strangulation and Several Kinds of Noxious Airs in Living Animals\u2026 and the More Effectual Means of Cure\u201d published in 1805 [21]. This was the first \u201cevidenced-based\u201d study published.

He designed a \u201cBarospirator,\u201d producing the final sarcophagus-like version in 1920. It was a tank large enough to encase the whole patient. His idea was to limit chest motion to a minimum. His was the first mechanical ventilator applied successfully for \u201clong-term\u201d use of several months [39] (Fig. 2.11). Its first success was to save a patient from paralyzing poliomyelitis [40]. A. L. Barach, in order to make the chest cage completely immobile to \u201crest\u201d the lungs to allow advanced tuberculosis cavities to \u201cclose,\u201d modified the Barospirator by making an upper section, encasing the head, and a lower body section, separated by a fine mesh nickel plated screen, producing cyclic, equal pressures both inside and outside the chest so that air would flow with no chest motion. He separated the head in his Barospirator because of a delay in pressure transfer due to airflow resistance from the upper airways, which allowed continued, albeit reduced, chest movements, and thus not total rest. He reported applying this therapy for 12 h per day and felt that it could take the place of induced pneumothorax, without or with the instilling of space occupying materials in the pleural cavity to collapse the cavitated lungs, all before the availability of chemo therapy for tuberculosis [41]. The effectiveness of Streptomycin and Para-aminosalicylic acid in 1945-46 ended the need for this.\n",

They engaged Dr. Cecil K. Drinker, Professor of Physiology at the Harvard School of Public Health, to help these victims. Dr. Drinker called on his brother engineer Philip A. Drinker, who worked with pediatrician Dr. Charles F. McKhann, III, and physiologist Dr. Louis Agassiz Shaw. Like Chillingworth and Hopkins, they had been experimenting with placing intact curare-paralyzed cats in iron boxes, with only the head protruding through a rubber, now airtight, collar. To move their thoraces, negative pressures were generated by a hand-operated syringe and later by a hand-operated cylinder piston pump causing inspiration when the air was sucked out. Pressure measurements in the plethysmograph, correlated with volumes of air moved in the cats. By 1927 they showed that, by alternating suction and release, the cats could be kept alive for several hours [42]. Such success, and the demands from the polio epidemic, led to their constructing a unit large enough to accommodate a human. They salvaged materials to make the first unit for about $ 500.00 ($ 6579 in 2013 US dollars). It was a metal cylinder with one end for the head to protrude with the neck encircled by an airtight collar. The other end had a piston pump through which pressure changes were generated [43]. Reliable electricity became available first on the two coasts in the USA about 1926; [44, 45] this allowed the unit to continuously produce alternating positive and negative pressures by a series of valves, thus moving the thorax. They used the units on themselves and on a diener recruited from the laboratory. Harvey Cushing was the \u201caudience\u201d for these experiments. Drinker himself was hyperventilated by this device and even though he did not resume breathing for 4 min he felt no anxiety as he \u201csimply waited until he felt the need to take a breath.\u201d Their first patient was a patient of Dr. McKhann, an 8-year-old girl with polio who was first acclimated to the noise of the unit by placing it in her room over night. By morning she was cyanotic and comatose. She was placed in the chamber and regained consciousness in several minutes and was said to have asked for ice cream a short time later [46]. Even though she died of pneumonia several days later, this dramatic success for the first reported human use of the iron lung, a device that supported breathing by externally applied alternating pressures, and the terrible polio epidemics, led to their widespread use. The funding for 14 more units was provided by the New York Consolidated Gas Co; one of these units was donated to Bellevue Hospital in New York City in 1929 when its use saved an unconscious apneic student nurse from an accidental drug overdose, a now expanded clinical indication for such ventilatory support. It was then applied to a Harvard student who had contracted poliomyelitis in Cambridge. This allowed him to gradually regain his breathing ability, to finish school, and go on to a full career. This was the first documented instance of private corporate financial support for research that led to direct and wide spread clinical application, i.e., \u201ctranslational\u201d medicine, becoming the model for such enterprises since. The incredible success of the Drinker-Shaw iron lung tank ventilator, in conjunction with the availability of reliable electric power across the whole country, and the escalating number of polio victims (from 20,000 to 60,000 cases per annum [47], affecting mostly children), set in motion the demand for mass production of the now-named Drinker Respirator. Warren E. Collins Company of Braintree, Massachusetts, was commissioned to make the units but their cost of $2000.00 each ($ 21,444 in 2013 US dollars) equaling the cost of two automobiles in 1929, limited their distribution (Fig. 2.13).\n",

Most children recovered and no longer required such ventilatory support, but the ones who did not recover lived in their tank ventilators, sometimes for more than 50 years. This was the beginning of designated respiratory care units for larger numbers of patients, the pre-intensive care units of today. As the key organizer, Wilson recruited The March of Dimes to establish 13 such centers across the USA [48] (Fig. 2.14).\n",

The Drinker unit was bulky and complex, and its cumbersome design making it difficult to use, coupled with the unaffordable cost, inspired John Haven Emerson, an engineer in Cambridge, Massachusetts and the grandson of poet Ralph Waldo Emerson, to simplify, modify, and improve the unit at half the cost in 1931. In addition to a sleeker design, his additional innovation was adding an airtight, transparent dome for the head for the application of IPPB so the body of the unit could be opened for unhurried nursing care while the patient was continuously supported noninvasively [50]. This unit had several glass side ports and larger rectangular metal doors on both sides through which care could be administered, blood gases and bloods drawn, and clinical observations made. He made a thick leather diaphragm to move the air and powered it with a standard vacuum cleaner pump to which a cyclic feature was added. Two vacuum pumps could be connected in series to amplify the pressures if needed. It could also be manually operated should there be a power failure, not uncommon at that time. The adult unit was 33\u201dwide \u00d7 92\u201dlong \u00d7 56\u201d high, and despite the weights for varying sizes from 640 to 800 lbs (290\u2013337 kg), it was a great success (Fig. 2.15a, 2.15b an opened unit; 2\u201315 C a unit with a transparent dome for the head; 2-15D Custom made model for a judge). Emerson deliberately decided not to patent his design because he wanted to make the units affordable and available as soon as needed throughout the country [51]. Their use was rapidly expanded where the new \u201crespiratory centers\u201d could accommodate many patients into single large rooms for multiple patients (aka \u201cTank Farms\u201d) and became the first dedicated respiratory care units (Fig. 2.14). A lawsuit by Drinker for infringement of patent rights failed after John Emerson published a pamphlet with a series of pictures depicting The Evolution of \u201cIron Lungs\u201d with previously designed negative pressure tank ventilators long before the Drinker model [49]. This pamphlet is the source for some of the figures in this chapter. Some of the patients, who either were unable to regain independent breathing function or only regained partial function while awake, were continuously or nocturnally supported for more than 60 years in their iron lungs [52, 53]. One such woman, who contracted polio in 1955 at age 5 just before the polio vaccine, is still using negative pressure ventilation 58 years later. She wrote a Haiku poem: \u201cThe story of Jonah\u2014narrow my bed in the belly of this iron lung yet wide enough for the dreams any child would chase [54].\u201d The Emerson Tank Respirator needed only \u201cgreasing of the motor and a new fan belt once a year\u201d to maintain reliable function for many years [55].\n",

After seeing the Drinker model work in New York, and with bulk and costs prohibitive for transporting the iron lung to Denmark, he \u201csimplified\u201d and improved on it by using water to power it from city pipes. A piston cylinder, acting on a large spirometer bell, created reciprocating movements from alternating the water between the upper and lower compartments of the piston to effect breathing cycles. The temperature inside the tank could be regulated by a water jacket. Another innovation was that the head could be placed in a 15\u00b0 head down position and could be encased in a hood through which oxygen or a mixture of 95 % oxygen and 5 % carbon dioxide would be administered to \u201cstimulate\u201d respiration (Fig. 2.15c). Mortality fell to 30 % using this ventilator. He also made an infant-sized version and a rocking stretcher, a forerunner of the Rocking Bed [56]. John Emerson advanced the Rocking Bed design and manufactured and distributed an electrically operated one used for long-term (for as long as 45 years) intermittent noninvasive ventilatory support for polio and other patients with persistent diaphragmatic paralysis [57] (Fig. 2.24). He also designed a Motion Bed to prevent skin decubitus ulcers and lung atelectasis, and to enhance circulation, in bed-ridden patients. We reported the use of the Emerson Rocking Bed for patients who developed diaphragmatic paralysis after open heart surgery, allowing for extubation or tracheostomy decannulation and recovery at home [58].",

In England in 1938, resources were contributed by William Morris (aka Lord Nuffield), an engineer-philanthropist, and owner of the Morris auto factory. After reading a newspaper headline that \u201cIron Lung Arrives Too Late\u201d to save the life of a young woman, he conferred with Sir Robert Macintosh, head of the Department of Anesthesia at Oxford, who had earlier impressed him with a film of the Both Respirator\u2019s capacity to perform artificial respiration. This unit was invented in 1937 by the brothers Edward and Donald Both in Adelaide, Australia. It was made from plywood, making it lighter, easier to transport, and cheaper than earlier versions. Edward had gone to England to sell an electrocardiograph he designed. Learning about the polio epidemic while there, he offered his design of the Both Portable Cabinet Respirator, which was quickly accepted, manufactured locally, and put into use (Fig. 2.16). After Edward built a unit for Robert Macintosh, a short film was made. This was the film that inspired the philanthropic act of Lord Nuffield when he offered to manufacture 5000 Both Respirator units at a personal cost of \u00a3 500,000 (equal to $ 2.5 million in 1938 and $ 32.7 million in 2013 US dollars) so that one unit could be given to every hospital in the UK, giving him \u201cthe pleasure\u201d of saving lives. Nuffield entrusted Macintosh to accomplish their distribution, and for teaching their use through daily demonstrations at the Radcliffe Clinic. By 1939, only 1 year later, more than 1700 Both Respirators had been allocated and its use taught throughout the UK. This heralded the extensive application for successful prolonged intervention for breathing inadequacies saving countless lives with NPNIV . Since Macintosh was an anesthesiologist, he conceived of using the Both Respirator to manage postoperative patients as well. He was the first, in 1940, and then with Mushin and Faux, in 1944, to demonstrate the successful prevention of postoperative atelectasis by use of the Both Respirator. This gave birth to the advent of \u201ccritical care\u201d medicine to provide respiratory support, and eventually to critical care units [59, 60]. Space needs and nursing care demands, however, remained impediments to the widespread use of such still bulky equipment.\n",

The unit had flexibility for clinical use in that it had several brands of vacuum pumps accommodating adjustment of pressures ranging from + 20 to \u2212 60 cm H2O, respiratory rates from 4 to 60/min, and variable inspiratory/expiratory ratios (Fig. 2.18). He traveled over 50,000 miles in his van using it in all the then 48 states. He died at age 70 in 2012 having been on ventilator support for life, initially full time, then nocturnal only, and finally back to full time, switching to positive pressure as he aged before his death [63]. The Porta-Lung was patented and FDA approved, and is still being used by patients due to their comfort and reliability [64]. The problem with this unit currently is replacing worn out negative pressure pumps, since the five that were available are no longer manufactured [65].\n",

            "text": "Complications from iron lung use slowly became apparent with their wider use. It stemmed from their bulk and weight, taking up so much space in a hospital room that floors had to be reinforced to support many tanks (Fig. 2.14). The patients felt isolated, resulting in claustrophobia, disorientation, and loneliness for many as well as inhibiting good nursing care. One such patient of mine, a post-polio wheelchair-dependent judge in New York City, started having recurring nightmares of being \u201ctrapped\u201d in the iron lung when he developed right heart failure from chronic hypoventilation 40 years later [71]. Using the Pneumosuit (Nu-Mo suit), instead, reversed the hypoventilation, and restored his capacity to work. Vital signs in the iron lung were cumbersome to measure, providing personal hygiene was difficult, and frequent turning to prevent decubitus ulcers was necessary. Even though the Emerson transparent dome reduced these problems for some of the time, air leak prevention from the tightness of the collar created neck skin abrasions and headaches. Patients experienced distress on hearing their own pulses from the tight collars. When less tight, the air leak made them feel cold, especially if they had total body paralysis as well. Some had difficulty initially learning how to synchronize their swallowing while in the iron lung. Aspiration due to the imposed supine posture would occur, at times resulting in death from pneumonia despite the support. Inadequate airways clearance, absent cough capacity, and lack of effective antibiotics contributed to such lethal pneumonias [72]. While some patients successfully used these units in their homes for many years, such units could not be housed there for many patients, particularly at the time that home care was not yet a developed discipline. The polio epidemics and his own polio inspired Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR) with friends to found The March of Dimes to provide the financial support for many patients in hospitals, in rehabilitation units, in the homes, and for scientific research for the polio vaccines. In fact it was FDR, focused on regaining the use of his legs after polio, who helped to establish the first rehabilitation unit in Warm Springs, Georgia, dedicated to the care and recovery of polio patients in 1924 [73].",

While Steuart\u2019s model was designed in 1918 it was not widely known or used. The design of the earlier cuirass models also allowed for only the anterior expansion of the chest wall due to its ending at the waist which limited diaphragmatic descent by compressing the anterior abdominal wall during inspiration. Lateral expansion was severely limited when the unit was flush with the lateral chest walls. The apices were usually excluded by the shell\u2019s upper configuration and necessary seal. Other shell designs that ended at the umbilicus or just above the pubis allowed for more diaphragmatic descent. If the metabolic requirements were low, the neck to waist model could be adequate. The advantages were their portability, lower cost, and the freeing of the extremities and pelvis with greater mobility and less claustrophobia. Some patients were able to be adequately ventilated in a near sitting position with such units, allowing for more daytime use. Some combined it with positive pressure using a mouth piece or lip-seal [74]. In fact, one of my chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients who had intractable dyspnea and chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure used NPNIV via a Nu-Mo suit nightly, achieving eucapnia, and went home to Brazil (Fig. 2.23). She worsened 2 years later. On her reevaluation, she had gained 35 lbs. This resulted in upper airways obstruction while using nocturnal NPNIV as Goldstein and Levy had reported [75, 76]. Increasing negative pressure from \u2212 35 to \u2212 40 cm H2O worsened this. She refused any other form of support. Adding  + 5 cm H2O nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) circumvented the upper airway obstruction, and she went home successfully using her Nu-Mo suit NPNIV and nasal CPAP.",

It was used to treat patients with heart failure [91]. My post polio and fibrothorax patients chronically using nocturnal NPNIV retained third space, diuretic resistant, fluid after general anesthesia for major abdominal cancer surgery when on postoperative positive pressure ventilation . They diuresed after they were replaced on their negative pressure systems, up to 7 L in 24 h [92]. A. Marks et al. using the Emerson made Poncho wrap plastic garment (\u201cRain Coat\u201d) applied through a rigid thoracoabdominal grid cage resting on a rigid plate, designed a novel patient-synchronized system, triggered by the patient from minute pressure changes at the nostrils or from a tracheotomy to initiate a breath. Even though the Poncho wrap could be used in children, the time and labor-intensive process of assuring an adequate seal using multiple clips along with the fitting process and for continuous supervision led to its disuse [93] (Fig. 22a, 22b and 22c).\n",

Tanks were found to generate from 34 to 100 % more volume than cuirasses in ten polio patients. Patients dying using cuirasses were described as having \u201canterior emphysema [94].\u201d Collier and Affeldt assessed 14 polio patients using a tank, when the tidal volume was taken as 100 % as base, and compared it to the thoracoabdominal cuirass and the chest shell. The patients, as their own controls, received 47 % of the tidal volume that the tank generated from the chest cuirass while the thoracoabdominal cuirass generated 62 % of the tidal volumes that the tank did, at the same negative pressures [95]. Upon increasing the negative pressure to obtain more volume, the pressure on the abdomen from the chest shell restricted diaphragm descent. In 1954 Bryce-Smith and Davis compared the tidal volumes delivered by the tank with the thoracic cuirass and the Rocking Bed in six healthy anesthetized volunteers given curare. To obtain equivalent tidal volumes the cuirass needed much more negative pressure [96]. This was also confirmed by Benton and Kriete in 1957 when they compared the cuirass, Rocking Bed and Pneumobelt and found that all three of these systems provided 50 % less tidal volume than a tank or positive pressure through a tracheotomy [97]. Cardus et al. compared arterial blood gases using three kinds of ventilators [98]. I measured a 30 to 40 % greater tidal volume from patients in the lateral decubitus position on a Rocking Bed than when they were supine, presumably due to unloading the chest and abdominal wall muscles from the hydrostatic pressure from abdominal organs and gravity, allowing both more chest expansion and diaphragmatic descent [71].",

Positive pressure had been used by anesthesiologists to administer anesthesia by manually squeezing a bag for intubated patients, for temporary respiratory depression and/or when curare was needed. That year saw 2722 admissions for acute poliomyelitis of which 866 (32 %) were paralytic, of which 316 (nearly 37 %) needed ventilation. For the 70 patients who needed a ventilator at the same time, there was only one tank and six cuirasses. This triggered Dr. H.C. A. Lassen with Dr. B. Ibsen to develop a high tracheotomy through which manual positive pressure could be delivered. Their previous experience in 1934 through 1944 saw a mortality of 80 %, using the cuirass, drop to 40 % by using positive pressure ventilation through a tracheotomy [99]. This experience and the increasing instances of less efficacious cuirass use for some patients led to expanding the use of positive pressure systems with new sets of problems.",

This triggered E. J. Tunnicliffe in 1958 to produce a jacket made of a blend of cotton with nylon, sealed with straps at the arms, neck, and buttocks over a plastic shell powered by an air pump which was proven to produce more than double the tidal volume of a standard cuirass (Fig. 2.23). J. M. K. Spalding and L. Opiel confirmed this with their report comparing the equivalency for the volume of air delivered with the Tunnicliffe cuirass jacket with IPPB in patients with polio and myasthenia gravis [107]. This was successful for long-term ventilation, reported after a year of customized cuirass use by Kinnear et al. with an 88 % survival rate and reduced need for hospitalization in patients with thoracoplasty and neuromuscular diseases [108].",

Emerson, difficulties with poor fitting, pain and/or calluses at the lateral chest wall or other pressure points from chest wall deformities, and expense led H. H. Pinkerton in 1957 to develop an abdominal cuirass belt made from a large sphygmomanometer-type cuff strapped over the nipples to just below the xiphisternum, and laterally to the posterior axillary line to deliver active positive pressure for exhalation which allowed passive recoil for negative pressure inhalation and ventilatory support. It allowed supported ventilation for airway procedures, a forerunner of the Pneumobelt [109]. Others reported successful Pneumobelt use for ventilatory support for respiratory insufficiency in high quadriplegics [110, 112].",

            "text": "The polio epidemic might have been controlled sooner but for politics, limited vision, academic infighting, and personalities. Dr. Hilary Kaprowski was the first to experiment with live polio vaccine in 1948, which he cultivated in the brains of polio susceptible cotton rats. He drank a blenderized portion of the brains, first to inoculate himself and then his children. No ill effects were suffered; no one got polio. He was then asked in 1950 to inoculate 20 mentally disabled children from Letchworth Village, Rockland, New York. Seventeen of the 20 developed antibodies to polio; the other three were already antibody positive prior to inoculation; none suffered any complications nor developed polio [113]. He was asked to provide his oral vaccine to several countries in Europe with similar results. The academic medical community protested his efforts due fear of using live, attenuated virus and to a complex interplay between his outsized personality and politics with science. Thus, an unproved theoretical fear led to the delay of mass vaccination until Dr. Jonas Salk developed an injectable dead virus vaccine in 1955. The immunity lasted only a year for some and some children tragically got polio from a virulent viral contaminated batch, ending the use of the Salk vaccine. Dr. Albert Sabin, who had worked with Hilary Kaprowoski, found that the polio virus invaded through the gut epithelium which led to his development of an effective attenuated oral vaccine in 1960. Wide spread oral vaccination led to the cessation of polio epidemics in industrialized countries [114]. However, polio remains prevalent, episodically, in third world countries where the vaccine is not available due to politics and/or ignorance and fear [115]. The most recent was an outbreak in Syria, in October, 2013, spreading to Lebanon due to the influx of Syrian refugees when vaccination was prevented by migration and lack of safety for health-care workers [116]. Taliban propaganda also halted polio vaccination in Pakistan and Somalia. In September 2013, The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation received one of the Albert and Mary Lasker Awards for public service for their work in providing the Sabin oral polio vaccine to thousands of children in Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan, with the goal of eradicating the virus from the earth as was done with smallpox [117].",

Many were impractical or useless and failed, but their failures fostered new efforts and designs, demanded by events, notably, drowning or asphyxiations, from pre-Biblical times, increasing in the seventeenth through the nineteenth centuries, and the polio epidemic in the twentieth century. Financial support, first from industry, then from private and government sources, permitted research to foster understanding and to developing and manufacturing workable systems for widespread application. The wealth of knowledge and experience gained led to the saving of many lives. These efforts through the ages takes us to the current day, bringing together the data to serve as a basis for improving the care of the ever increasing numbers of patients who might still benefit from using negative pressure noninvasive ventilation for a variety of respiratory disorders awake, in sleep, or both, and for potentially extended periods of time, up to a lifetime for some.",
