            "text": "Infection of mice by some microorganisms including viruses, parasites and bacteria, or inoculation of products such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), induce, in addition to secretion of specific antibodies, a strong B lymphocyte polyclonal activation resulting in hypergammaglobulinemia (1\u20134). The isotypic distribution of these Ig depends on the stimulus involved: LPS induces a response that is dominated by IgM and IgG3 (4\u20136); responses induced by parasites such as Plasmodium chabaudi, Trypanosoma cruzi and Toxoplasma gondii are restricted to the IgG2a subclass (7\u201310); a similar IgG2a preponderance has been reported after infection with viruses like lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV), mouse hepatitis virus, murine adenovirus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and murine cytomegalovirus (1,6,11\u201314). The enhanced production of natural antibodies resulting from such B cell polyclonal activation may play an important role in the defense against infections, especially at the early times after invasion of the host by viruses or bacteria, when specific responses have not yet matured (15). However, the mechanisms leading to this type of immune response are not fully understood. In many cases, a T lymphocyte-independent proliferation of B cells (1,14,16) results probably from a direct interaction of a microorganism product with some receptor expressed on these cells (17\u201320). In contrast, Ig switch and secretion by these activated B lymphocytes are more likely regulated by Th cell-dependent mechanisms involving interaction with cytokines (1,13,21\u201324).",

Moreover, the production of other Ig isotypes, such as IgA and IgG, by B lymphocytes already committed to their secretion is enhanced by IL-6 (26,27). In addition, IL-6 is a potent in vitro and in vivo growth factor for murine plasmacytomas (28\u201330). Therefore, it is plausible to hypothesize that IL-6 could play a role in microorganism-triggered Ig production, including that following B lymphocyte polyclonal activation, especially since the secretion of this molecule has been shown to be induced by both LPS and parasitic and viral infection (31\u201338). Our results indicate that, at least in some mouse strains, IL-6 is indeed required for hypergammaglobulinemia induced by microorganisms and derived products, but not for the secretion of specific antibodies, suggesting that specific or polyclonal B lymphocyte activations are differentially regulated by this cytokine.",

To analyze the role of IL-6 in LDV-induced Ig production, we first determined whether this virus triggered secretion of the cytokine. Thus, IL-6 was bioassayed in the serum of 129/Sv animals at different times post-infection (p.i.). As shown in Fig. 1(A) for one experiment among four performed, a transient peak of serum IL-6 was detected during the first day p.i. At later times p.i., no IL-6 was found by this method (data not shown). These results were confirmed by RT-PCR analysis of IL-6 message expression in spleen and peritoneal cells from 129/Sv mice. A strong, but transient IL-6 message was induced by the virus (Fig. 1B, shown for one of three experiments performed). This IL-6 expression peaked at 24 h p.i. in spleen cells while it was already nearly at its maximum at 6 h p.i. in peritoneal cells. At 36 h p.i., the IL-6 message returned to nearly normal levels both in spleen and peritoneal cells. Similar kinetics were observed in spleen and peritoneal cells of LDV-infected CBA mice (data not shown).",

No modification in IL-6 secretion was observed after this treatment (Table 1, results representative of two experiments). Moreover, BALB/c nu/nu and BALB/cBy-SCID mice produced as much IL-6 after LDV infection as their normal BALB/c counterparts (data not shown). The cellular origin of LDV-induced IL-6 was also analyzed by RT-PCR, after purification of spleen cell subpopulations. At 12 h p.i., a strong IL-6 message was detected in MAC-1-enriched cells, but not in B neither in T lymphocytes (shown in Fig. 2 for two independent experiments).

The role of IL-6 in these effects was analyzed in B6,129-IL6tm1Kopf mice that are deficient for this cytokine. LDV-induced B lymphocyte proliferation, measured by thymidine incorporation, was similar in IL-6-deficient and normal animals (data not shown). In contrast, a strong reduction of total serum IgG2a levels following LDV infection was observed in IL-6-deficient mice when compared to normal counterparts (Fig. 3A, shown for one of three experiments done). This phenomenon was not due to a delayed IgG2a secretion, as it was found at different times after virus inoculation (data not shown). Interestingly, a moderate, although significant (P \u2a7d 0.01 by Mann\u2013Whitney test) difference was already found in basal IgG2a levels of uninfected mice (Fig. 3A). Although LDV-induced IgG2b secretion seemed slightly increased in IL-6-deficient mice when compared to normal infected animals, the difference was not significant (P \u2a7e 0.05). No IL-6-related difference was observed for IgG3. Finally, basal IgG1 levels were slightly higher in IL-6-deficient mice than in normal animals (P = 0.03 and \u2a7d0.01 for control and infected mice, respectively). Despite this difference, no increase in IgG1 levels followed LDV infection of IL-6-deficient mice. This control of LDV-induced total IgG2a secretion by IL-6 was confirmed by spleen cell cultures. As shown in Fig. 4 for one of two experiments performed, the production of total IgG2a by spleen cells obtained from IL-6-deficient mice 1 week after infection was indeed much lower than that of cells from their normal counterparts.",

On the other hand, our data fit well with other reports of IL-6 secretion by mouse or human macrophages after infection with different viruses, including Newcastle disease virus, respiratory syncytial virus and coxsackievirus (49\u201351). Together with a previous report of early IL-12 expression following infection (41), our observation indicates that LDV triggers a transient macrophage activation that may initiate a cascade of events responsible for some of the effects of the virus on the immune responses, such as B lymphocyte polyclonal activation.

Only moderate influence on total IgG2a serum levels were observed after treatment with anti-IL-6 or anti-IL-6 receptor antibodies in BALB/c or NZB/W F1 mice, although an inhibition of IgG1 responses was found (52,53). Inhibition of total or specific Ig was reported in B6\u00d7129 mice deficient for IL-6 after administration of various stimuli such as ovalbumin, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide, vaccinia virus or murine cytomegalovirus (14,54,55). Interestingly, a strong decrease of IgG2a, IgG2b and IgG3, but not IgG1 antigen-specific antibodies was reported in these animals after immunization with DNP\u2013ovalbumin (56). In contrast, whereas administration of Schistosoma mansoni eggs resulted in a decreased specific anti-egg antigen IgG1 and IgG2a antibody secretion in IL-6-deficient mice (57), IgG production by granuloma cells following s.c. infection with the same parasite was not modified in the absence of the cytokine (58). Similarly, a polyclonal IgG2a production induced by gammaherpesvirus 68 appeared to be IL-6-independent in the same B6\u00d7129 mice (59). In addition, independent studies performed with IL-6-deficient mice of the 129/Sv genetic background showed, in the absence of the cytokine, an increase of IgG2a antibodies after immunization with ovalbumin and infection with T. gondii (60,61). Interestingly, in contrast to the large decrease in total IgG2a production reported here after LDV infection of IL-6-deficient B6\u00d7129 mice, in C57BL/6 animals, LDV-induced total IgG2a production was IL-6-independent (data not shown), which fits well with a similar difference between mouse strains reported after ovalbumin immunization (56).

Apparently conflicting results have been reported on the ability of IL-6 to affect Th lymphocyte differentiation (57,62). However, because T-independent LPS-induced IgG3 production was affected by the absence of IL-6 as well as T-dependent responses triggered by virus and parasite, it seems reasonable to postulate that this effect of the cytokine on B cells does not require the presence of T lymphocytes. Although in some models IL-6 was able to induce IgG1 responses (47), this isotype, whereas secreted at rather low levels in our models, was not decreased in the absence of IL-6, a finding reported by other authors as well (56), and was even higher in control IL-6-deficient B6\u00d7129 mice than in their normal counterparts.

In addition, we have recently reported that anti-LDV specific antibody responses were controlled by IFN-\u03b3, but that total Ig production triggered by LDV or T. gondii did not require the presence of this cytokine (24) that is produced after infection with both infectious agents (10,63 and manuscripts in preparation). Together, these observations strongly suggest that parasite- or virus-induced total polyclonal IgG and specific antibody secretion originate from B lymphocytes that are differentially regulated by cytokines. It may thus be postulated that two distinct and successive humoral responses are triggered by primary infections: early after invasion of the host, a polyclonal production of IgG2a might enhance the levels of natural antibodies recognizing microorganisms, even with a low affinity, that will help to restrict their proliferation (15). The nature of this polyclonal Ig response remains unsolved. The IL-6-independence of the anti-KLH IgG2a antibody response that developed in mice immunized at the time of infection suggests that this cytokine does not enhance all ongoing immune responses. However, it remains possible that some concomitant responses directed against particular antigens, such as carbohydrates or lipids, and/or originating from specific B cell subpopulations, such as B1 cells, could be increased by the virus through IL-6 secretion. Alternatively, this enhanced antibody production may correspond to the stimulation of long-lived plasma cells already committed to IgG secretion (64,65). Why this response develops so fast may be explained by its control by IL-6, which is secreted by macrophages immediately after infection. Although other mechanisms are certainly also involved, it is possible that increased susceptibility of IL-6-deficient mice to various viruses, bacteria and parasites (39,61,66) is, at least partly, related to an impairment of this early polyclonal B cell response. Following this early secretion of total Ig, a more specific antibody response, involving longer recruitment of specific antiviral or anti-parasite B lymphocytes, and controlled by IFN-\u03b3, whose secretion requires subsequent activation of different cell populations like NK cells or lymphocytes, but not by IL-6, will then complete and tighten the control of the invading microorganism.",
