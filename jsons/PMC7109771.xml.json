Histologically, the main finding was diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) in the acute stage, characterized by extensive hyaline membrane formation Image 1B and Image 1C affecting large portions of the sampled parenchyma. This was accompanied by hyperplasia of type 2 alveolar pneumocytes. Focally, there was airspace and alveolar septal fibroblast proliferation, suggesting areas of transition to the organizing stage of DAD. Other areas showed a mild chronic inflammatory infiltrate composed of a sprinkling of lymphocytes and plasma cells within interstitium and airspaces, admixed with the DAD. Extensive fresh intra-alveolar hemorrhage was also present Image 1D, both associated with and away from the areas of DAD. Small foci of acute inflammation were present in the airspaces and interstitium, but these were not extensive. The bronchi showed mild autolysis and partial sloughing of the respiratory epithelium but no necrosis or ulceration Image 1E. One small bronchus contained a tiny focus of squamous metaplasia Image 1F. There was minimal and focal chronic inflammation in the bronchial mucosa. Mild chronic inflammation was seen in and around the bronchial submucosal glands, composed predominantly of lymphocytes and an occasional plasma cell. No eosinophils or neutrophils were identified, and there was no basement membrane thickening.",

One of their patients (case 20) was a 52-year-old woman hospitalized for a head injury sustained when she was intoxicated. The authors made the point that in rare cases, influenza virus is recovered from the lungs of patients lacking premonitory symptoms of a flu-like illness. Pathologically, our second case had typical features of a superimposed bacterial pneumonia. The associated/underlying virus-associated DAD was overshadowed by the bacterial process to such an extent that the DAD was initially thought to be a result of the bacterial pneumonia. If influenza A (H1N1) virus had not been detected by rRT-PCR from the patient\u2019s lungs, the presence of the virus-related DAD could have been easily overlooked and attributed to bacterial infection.",

As case 1 illustrates, the diagnosis may not be suspected unless a specific aspect of the history raises this possibility. The resultant delay in diagnosis and therapy may result in an unfavorable outcome. Even with a high index of suspicion, clinical diagnosis is difficult because confirmatory testing takes at least a few days and up to a week. Our second case highlights the difficulty in suspecting novel influenza A (H1N1) infection in patients with atypical clinical manifestations. In such cases, in which there are virtually no clinical clues to suggest a viral process, it may impossible to make a correct diagnosis antemortem. It is safe to state, however, that in the throes of a pandemic, any patient with an unexplained flu-like illness or acute bronchopneumonia should be tested for novel influenza A (H1N1), especially if there is a history of contact with known cases or with children with flu-like symptoms.",

Other viral infections associated with DAD include avian influenza (H5N1),23 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus,24 adenovirus, hantavirus, herpesvirus, cytomegalovirus, parainfluenza virus, and measles virus. Noninfectious causes of DAD also need to be considered, including drug reactions, toxic inhalants, gastric acid aspiration, and connective tissue disease.25 In the vast majority of cases, the histologic features of DAD are nonspecific and do not allow determination of a precise cause. Therefore, results of ancillary testing, as in our cases, are often pivotal in establishing a specific etiologic agent.",
