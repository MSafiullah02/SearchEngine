The primary interest of this paper is how well the logistic equation can predict the outcome of COVID-19 epidemic in any regions of the World assuming that the methodology of the testing process, namely the data collection method and social behavior is not changing over the course of time. Besides the social relevance, this study has two scientific purposes: we investigate if a simple saturation model can describe the trend of the COVID-19 epidemic and if so, we would like to determine, from which point during the epidemic the fitting parameters provide reliable predictions. We also give estimations for the outcome of this epidemic in several countries based on the logistic model and the data available on 27 March, 2020. Based on the saturated cases in China, we have managed to find some criteria to judge the reliability of the predictions.",

            "text": "The outbreak of COVID-19 is the third time that a zoonotic coronavirus has crossed species to infect humans in the past two decades after SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV those with rather high lethality rate [1] . This type of corona virus appeared first and become an epidemic in Wuhan, Hupei, China and quickly spread over the World with an initially estimated reproductive number of 2.2 [2] . From data analysis point of view, the speed of spreading is decoded in the available data points even if the epidemic is still going on and not started to saturate yet. Of course, at the very beginning of the process the accuracy of the fitting and predictions can be questioned. For a finalized epidemic, the curve for the cumulative number of infected cases mostly shows the behavior of the logistic growth as it is shown in Figure 1 which is the data for the Henan region, China. The cumulative number of infectious cases show such behavior that resembles to the well-known logistic growth, namely the outbreak has an exponentially increasing regime. This emerging segment is followed by an inflection point from that the number of daily infections starts to decrease. And finally, the cumulative number of cases is saturated, and no additional infection appears at the end of the process. The idea to use this approach to describe and predict the epidemic growth comes from Ref. [3] where the number of deaths during the epidemic process is analyzed for Italy this way. We similarly use the solution of the logistic equation in a different form (different mathematical basis) than in Ref. [3] to find the optimum parameters to the investigated dataset and calculate the expected duration and expected maximum number of infections. But in contrast we apply it for the number of registered infections instead of the number of deaths. Similar analysis, using a logistic fit was used in many additional works to predict the outcome of COVID-19 in selected regions recently [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . We intend to extend this method to as much countries as possible and to make effort to describe the error of any prediction with the logistic model, and for that we introduce a variable to determine the reliability of the logistic fit. This parameter is evaluated based on the latest data point and the maximum number of cases given by the fitting.",

The data for those places is not published in this study and denoted with NaN. Some cases, the trend of the epidemic does not follow a logistic behavior such as in cases of Figure 5 and Figure 6 . Unfortunately, in some regions of China (Figure 6 ), after a saturated period, a second wave of the epidemic can be observed. Those regions will be studied later because such second waves can happen in the future in any other locations too.",

During the next week, EFVCNRI should continue converging, and in those regions, signs of the saturation might be observable. Furthermore, we expect that countries with R>10 values are also getting within the converging regime soon to predict the outcome of their epidemic process more accurately.",
