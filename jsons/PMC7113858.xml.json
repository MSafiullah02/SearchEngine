            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a respiratory disease in humans that is caused by a lineage C Betacoronavirus, namely, MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV). It was first identified in the Middle East in 2012 (Zaki et al., 2012). Patients with MERS who live outside of the endemic region but have a history of travel to or a temporary residence in the Middle East have been also identified (de Groot et al., 2013). To date, at least 2000 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS have been reported: the case fatality rate (CFR) is more than 30% (WHO, 2017). While most patients show severe symptoms with a high CFR, some mild or asymptomatic cases are reported during MERS outbreaks, and human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV is relatively limited when compared with that during outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 (Al-Gethamy et al., 2015, Drosten et al., 2014, Memish et al., 2014). These observations and reports are supported by a cross-sectional study in Saudi Arabia which showed that in December 2012\u2013December 2013, 0.15% of the healthy population had anti-MERS-CoV antibodies (Muller et al., 2015).",

Furthermore, MERS-CoV appears to be circulating outside the Middle East since the virus has been detected in dromedary camels in East, West, and North Africa (Reusken et al., 2014). Since bat-coronaviruses (BtCoV)-HKU4 and -HKU5, which are detected in Tylonycteris and Pipistrellus bats, respectively, are closely related to MERS-CoV, bats may be suspected to be a natural host of MERS-CoV (Lu and Liu, 2012). However, it is not clear whether MERS-CoV can be transmitted from bats to camels, or to other animal species.",

            "text": "The most preferred screening tools for detecting serum antibodies against pathogens are immunofluorescence assays (IFA) and conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). However, the usefulness of these assays in terms of detecting anti-MERS-CoV antibodies is limited by the fact that antibodies against the conserved proteins of coronaviruses are often cross-reactive; as a result, these assays often yield false-positive reactions (Chen et al., 2015, Corman et al., 2012, Meyer et al., 2014). Neutralization assays such as the plaque reduction neutralization test or micro-plate neutralization test are set up using susceptible cell lines and live MERS-CoV. These neutralization assays are considered to be the gold standard for detecting and measuring serum antibody responses to MERS-CoV because they are highly specific and sensitive (Hemida et al., 2014, Perera et al., 2013, Reusken et al., 2013b). However, these assays require high containment laboratories due to the use of highly pathogenic live MERS-CoV. Alternative neutralization assays based on replication-incompetent pseudoparticles, which are generated using vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) or human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), have been developed as safe and high-throughput neutralization tests (Fukuma et al., 2015, Hemida et al., 2014, Perera et al., 2013). In addition, a cell-free protein microarray that uses the S1 fragment of the MERS-CoV S protein as the antigen has been developed (Reusken et al., 2013a).",

The critical amino acid residues required for binding MAb 45E11 (K543 and Q544), MAb 45C2 (R542 and S546), and MAb 43A9 (G462) were identified (Fig. 3\nA). According to the structure of the RBD of the MERS-CoV S protein complexed with the human receptor molecule DPP4 (Wang et al., 2013, Ying et al., 2015), all of these critical residues were located on the DPP4-binding site of the S protein (Fig. 3A). The fact that the putative epitopes of the three MAbs were located on the DPP4-binding site of the RBD suggests that these MAbs may inhibit the entry of MERS-CoV by blocking the interaction between the MERS-CoV RBD and DPP4. The 45E11 and 45C2 epitopes were likely to overlap with each other because the amino acid substitutions in the escape mutants were very close to each other (Fig. 3A). Indeed, the two MERS-CoV mutants that escaped neutralization by 45E11 (i.e., MERS-CoV-45E11-K543N and MERS-CoV-45E11-Q544H) grew efficiently in the presence of 45C2. Similarly, the two MERS-CoV mutants that escaped neutralization by 45C2 (i.e., MERS-R542T and MERS-S546Y) replicated well in the presence of 45E11. By contrast, the 43A9 MAb strongly neutralized all of these escape mutants. In addition, the 45E11 and 45C2 MAbs effectively neutralized the G462D escape mutant of 43A9 (Fig. 3B). Thus, the mutant viruses that escaped from 45E11 also escaped from 45C2, and vice versa, which indicates that the epitopes of these two MAbs overlap. Sequence analysis of the heavy and light chain genes of 45C2 and 45E11 revealed several amino acid differences in the variable region, including in the complementary determining region (Supplementary Fig. S4).",

Thus, we performed the cELISA on 66 serum samples that were collected from dromedary camels in 2013 in Ethiopia. The cut-off values in the cELISA were determined by using 42 negative control sera from multiple species including rabbits, rats, mice, and healthy human donors.

Relative to neutralization tests with live MERS-CoV (the gold standard in the field for detecting anti-MERS-CoV antibodies), the cELISA was able to detect dromedary camel sera that were positive (n\n = 63) and negative (n\n = 3) for MERS-CoV-specific antibodies with a sensitivity and specificity of 98% and 100%, respectively. Moreover, the cELISA was able to detect anti-MERS-CoV antibodies in sera from MERS-CoV-infected rats and rabbits that had been immunized with MERS-CoV S protein. In addition, negative control samples, including sera from rabbits and mice that had been immunized with SARS-CoV particles, the N protein of MERS-CoV, or the S protein of SARS-CoV, did not inhibit the binding of the MAb to the MERS-CoV antigen at even the lowest serum dilution (8-fold). Because the anti-sera against other coronaviruses were not available in this study, we did not test specificity of cELISA using them. However, to ensure the accuracy and versatility of the cELISA, the labeled MAb was characterized in terms of its antigen specificity (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S1). This confirms that the specificity of the cELISA is high. Thus, the cELISA detects MERS-CoV antibody in a non-species-dependent and highly-specific manner. Furthermore, we found that the three MAbs that we selected for epitope analyses (including 45C2) were highly specific for the RBD of the S protein of MERS-CoV. When we compared the RBD amino acid sequences of >170 strains of MERS-CoV in the NCBI database, we found that the amino acid residues that were critical for the recognition of the three MAbs are conserved in all strains (data not shown). This indicates that all MERS-CoV strains that have been reported to date are likely to be recognized by the three MAbs. Thus, all three MAbs may be useful for detecting MERS-CoV-specific antibodies in cELISA. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a cELISA that is based on a MERS-CoV S protein-specific MAb.",

The two mutations of the 45C2 escape viruses were both located on the RBD, specifically within the site that binds to the human host receptor DPP4, which mediates the infection with the virus (Wang et al., 2013, Ying et al., 2015). These observations suggest that the 45C2 MAb reacts with the DPP4-binding site in the RBD and that this is responsible for its ability to neutralize MERS-CoV infection of Vero cells. This is supported by the fact that, in cELISAs, serum antibodies inhibit the labeled antibody either by blocking the labeled antibody epitope directly or by recognizing a neighboring epitope and therefore providing spatial competition (Hirota et al., 2012). Given that a neutralizing epitope appears to be the target for the competition between the 45C2 MAb and the test serum antibodies, it is likely that the inhibitory serum antibodies that are detected by our cELISA will be neutralizing antibodies.",

The 45C2 MAb was mixed with serially diluted sera from a rat that had been infected with MERS-CoV, two rabbits that had been immunized with the S protein of MERS-CoV, a rabbit that had been immunized with the N protein of MERS-CoV, a rabbit that had been immunized with the S protein of SARS-CoV, a rabbit that had been immunized with UV-inactivated SARS-CoV particles, and a rat that had been mock infected with MERS-CoV. The mixtures were then subjected to cELISA using whole UV-inactivated MERS-CoV antigen. The percent inhibitions relative to the \u2018no antibody\u2019 control that were obtained from three independent experiments and are expressed as means and standard deviations are shown.
