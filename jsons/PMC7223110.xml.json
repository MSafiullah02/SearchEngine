            "text": "Chikungunya is a vector born arthritogenic febrile illness caused by an alphavirus of the Togaviridae family. Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) was the first time isolated from a dengue-like epidemic in Tanzania [1]. CHIKV is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, which are also responsible for spreading Dengue and Zika viruses [2]. Apart from the usual clinical manifestations of mosquito-borne infection, CHIKV infected individuals endure extreme joint pain due to over secretion of cytokines that may last for months to years. The rapid expansion of CHIKV on a global scale was facilitated by an ecologically plastic mosquito Aedes albopictus [3, 4]. Comparatively, A. albopictus is more diverse and ecologically stable than A. aegypti, therefore it is found in dominant position in Kenya, Comoros, La\u2019 Reunion (France), India, Southeast Asia, Seychelles, Mauritius, Madagascar and Mayotte CHIKV outbreaks [5]. In the present scenario, The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious disease (NIAID), USA re-categorized CHIKV into priority group B pathogen of their Emerging Infectious Disease [6]. Complications associated with CHIKV infections include Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, Encephalomyelopathy, Neonatal Hypotonia, Uveitis, Retinitis, Optic Neuritis, Myelopathy and Myelitis [7]. So far, the CHIKV control measure includes the prevention of infection only. There is no vaccine and antiviral for CHIKV, therefore a specific, economical and effective antiviral molecule desire.",

Plant metabolites can be more safe, effective and economical, especially for vulnerable areas that have limited resources [12]. Medicinal plants have great potential for therapeutic purposes. The present study focuses on the antiviral properties of Z. officinale which is an herbaceous Asian plant.

Chemically synthesized antivirals have a variety of side effects as compared to natural medicinal plant remedies [22].\nAccording to the Indian Ayurvedic system, Z. officinale (Ginger) is a well-known medicinal plant and very helpful in controlling gastrointestinal problems by reducing nausea. Ginger is already utilized to treat morning sickness, heartburn, colic, stomach upset, gas, flatulence, bloating, diarrhea, loss of appetite and dyspepsia [23\u201325]. Ginger act as an analgesic and helpful for muscle soreness, arthritis, chest pain, stomach pain, low back pain, and menstrual pain. Ginger is a well-known medicinal plant to treat cough, respiratory tract infections, bronchitis. Fresh and dilute juice of ginger is very useful in skin burns treatment. Active components of ginger are utilized as a laxative and antacid medication. As per Ayurveda system, Ginger is well known for the treatment of a variety of cancers including skin, oral, breast, liver, gastric, pancreatic, colon, renal, prostate, brain, ovarian and cervical cancer. Ginger has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-mutagenic properties [26].",

In another study, plant extract and their AgNPs of T. cordifolia, have the potential to interfere with CHIKV and able to increase the 75% and 56% Vero viability when these cells were treated MNTD and half of MNTD, respectively. Medicinal plants are very sensitive, specific and cost-effective against various old and emerging viruses. In another similar study on influenza virus, aqueous Isatidis Radix extract were screening for the anti-influenza property in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells, less influenza viruses were observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) in the Isatidis Radix extract pre-treated cells than the cells without Isatidis Radix extract treatment [31]. Despite the huge immunization and modern medication, many viruses lack preventive vaccines and effective antiviral therapies. In the situation, identification of novel antiviral drugs from medicinal plants are more importance as natural products are an excellent source and safer. Medicinal plants are good source of antiviral and effective herbal medicines [32].",
