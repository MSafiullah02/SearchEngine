            "text": "The coronavirus spike protein is a type I transmembrane protein that assembles as a trimer and projects outward from viral particles forming the distinctive corona or crown-like appearance of coronaviruses [1]. The spike protein controls to a large extent virus entry events as it accomplishes the critical functions of host cell receptor attachment and membrane fusion [2]. Coronavirus spike envelope glycoproteins are classified as class I viral fusion proteins [3]. Spike monomers are organized into a receptor-binding domain, named S1, and the fusion machinery domain, called S2 [4]. Many coronavirus spike proteins are proteolytically processed by host cell proteases at the junction between the S1 and S2 domains, at a site named S1/S2 (Fig. 1) [5]. An additional cleavage event occurs at a site found within the S2 domain, immediately upstream of the fusion peptide, and termed S2\u2019 (Fig. 1) [6]. For coronaviruses, entry and viral fusion can occur at the plasma membrane or in endosomes, depending on protease availability and other microenvironmental cues [7, 8]. The cleavage event at S2\u2019 is analogous to the proteolytic processing of the prototypical class I viral fusion protein influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) [9, 10]. Influenza virus entry occurs in the endosomal compartment. The critical HA proteolytic activation step releases the fusion peptide, located at the N-terminal tip of the fusion domain (HA2). Within maturing endosomes, the acidic pH triggers major conformational changes that allow membrane insertion of the fusion peptide and initiation of the merging of viral and host cell membranes [7].",

            "text": "Biochemical characterization of the spike activation step in the coronavirus life cycle is crucial to understand how this essential event impacts entry into host cells and modulates host cell and tissue tropism, host range and pathogenicity. Slight modifications of viral envelope glycoprotein cleavage sites via mutations can have a profound impact on host protease substrate recognition and activation, leading to changes in pathogenicity. This is typified by highly pathogenic strains of avian influenza (H5N1 strains) where modifications of the HA cleavage motif from a monobasic to a polybasic site switches the proteolytic activation mechanism [11]. Such cleavage site modification is accompanied by a change in host protease requirement from a trypsin-like protease to a more ubiquitously expressed furin-like protease, allowing for systemic infection and increased disease severity. Interestingly, coronavirus spike proteins and in particular the envelope glycoprotein of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have been shown in cell culture to be cleaved by a number of host cell proteases such as cathepsins [12\u201314], trypsin-like proteases, notably membrane-bound transmembrane protease, serine 2 ( TMPRSS2) [12\u201315], and members of the pro-protein convertase family of enzymes such as furin [16, 17]. The latter group of proteases may not be major players for typical routes of virus entry in respiratory epithelial cells [18], but could nonetheless be important activators for extra-pulmonary spread of MERS-CoV [17]. While various proteases have been shown to activate MERS-CoV spike in cell culture systems, it has recently been proposed that TMPRSS2 plays a predominant activating role in virus entry in respiratory epithelial cells [19].",

            "text": "Western blot analyses of spike protein cleavage products produced by host proteases is an important investigative tool allowing a better understanding of the roles of cleavage activation and proteases in the life cycle of coronaviruses. The aim of this chapter is to present a detailed protocol allowing the characterization by western blot of the proteolytic processing of the MERS-CoV spike protein, by transient co-transfection of a plasmid encoding MERS-CoV spike and increasing amounts of a plasmid encoding a host protease (see\nNote 1). An advantage of this transient transfection-based method compared to MERS-CoV infection-based experiments is that it does not require a biosafety level 3 facility to be performed. We will explain some possible difficulties of the method as well as provide tips and troubleshooting guides. The protease chosen to illustrate the method is matriptase or suppression of tumorigenicity 14 (ST-14) [20], an enzyme belonging to the type II transmembrane serine protease (TTSP) family, which also groups members such as human airway trypsin-like protease (HAT), TMPRSS2, and corin. The activity of matriptase is tightly regulated by the binding of hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor type 1 (HAI-1) [21], a Kunitz-type transmembrane serine protease inhibitor . Matriptase is broadly expressed by epithelial cells and throughout the respiratory tract, in particular in airway epithelial cells [22]. While it is synthesized as a membrane-bound protease, the catalytic domain of matriptase can be shed and act extracellularly. Importantly, while matriptase was found to activate the envelope glycoprotein of other viruses such as influenza virus HA [22, 23], its role in proteolytic processing of coronavirus spike protein has not been characterized. The analysis illustrated here allows to characterize the cleavage pattern induced by co-expression of MERS-CoV spike and matriptase in transiently transfected cells. In the absence of matriptase expression, the assay confirms processing of MERS-CoV spike at the S1/S2 site by an endogenous protease, likely furin or a furin-like enzyme as demonstrated previously [17]. Intriguingly, further cleavage, mediated by matriptase expression releases an as-yet uncharacterized spike fragment migrating at 25 kDa.",

            "text": "\nThis protocol allows characterization of spike protein proteolytic processing by transient co-transfection of MERS-CoV S-encoding and human matriptase-encoding plasmids. However, there are other methods to analyze the envelope glycoprotein cleavage step. For example, using murine hepatitis virus (MHV) coronavirus infection in susceptible cells, Wicht and colleagues have elegantly engineered a biotinylation-based intracellular labeling assay to selectively label spike proteins that have undergone fusion to analyze their cleavage status [24]. Note that in the case of MERS-CoV infection, the latter experiment would require access to a BSL-3 facility. Another, more biochemical approach is to incubate viral particles such as coronavirus spike-pseudotyped particles with a purified recombinant protease and perform a western blot assay [17, 25].In our hands, the HEK-293 T/17 cells described in this protocol are found to be only semi-adherent and are prone to easily detach from cell culture surfaces. If this issue is encountered, we recommend to handle the cells with care, being mindful to use pre-warmed (37 \u00b0C) DPBS and media as much as possible. We have found that pretreating cell culture plastic surfaces with poly-D-lysine helps the cells adhere better to surfaces. During cell detachment we recommend avoiding incubating cells with trypsin for more than 5 min as this paradoxically often leads to cells aggregating.To avoid cells clumping in the middle of wells and being sparsely distributed near the edges, we recommend to refrain from circular motion or tilting the plate.In this protocol we use Lipofectamine 2000 as transfection reagent. We found that it works well for the cell type being used (HEK-293 T/17). Other transfection reagents and/or methods (electroporation) can also be used, if needed. Lipofectamine 2000 tends to bind to plastic materials such as the walls of microcentrifuge tubes. As such, it is recommended to always place Lipofectamine 2000-containing solutions in tubes that already contain a diluent rather than in direct contact with the walls of microcentrifuge tubes.Transfection reagents such as the one used here (Lipofectamine 2000) increase cell membrane permeability. Because of this effect, antibiotics that are typically added in cell culture media (penicillin and streptomycin) tend to increase in cytotoxicity. It is thus recommended to use cell medium devoid of antibiotics after cells receive transfection reagents such as Lipofectamine 2000.LDS stored at 4 \u00b0C partially precipitates. To better pipet correct volumes, we recommend warming LDS at 37 \u00b0C to ensure working with a correctly solubilized solution. Also, we have found for other coronavirus spike proteins that reducing conditions (DTT) and/or application of heat (95 \u00b0C for 5 min) can negatively impact antibody detection at later steps of the western blot assay. We suggest to test different conditions (with or without DTT and/or with or without heat) to check which ones work best for a given coronavirus spike protein.At this point, protein samples can be directly analyzed by western blot assay or stored at \u221220 \u00b0C until used. Once frozen and kept at \u221220 \u00b0C, the samples are stable for several months. The protein samples are relatively tolerant to a few freeze-thaw cycles but we would suggest to refrain from multiple freeze-thaw cycles (5 or more). A workaround to avoid this problem is to aliquot samples into smaller volumes prior to the initial freezing.The polyacrylamide gel used in this protocol is a pre-cast 4\u201312% gradient gel. We have found that it allows to obtain good separation of full-length coronavirus spike and fragments generated by proteolytic activity. Other kinds of gels can be used as well, including gels made in the lab, which are relatively easy to prepare.Most of the gel migration is performed at 200 V with constant voltage. However, we have sometimes found that applying the full voltage of 200 V from the start of migration can result in irregularities in the migration pattern of protein bands. To avoid this, we have found that starting at a lower voltage (e.g., 100 V) and incrementally increasing (e.g., 20 V increments) to 200 V over a 10\u201315 min timeframe allows to obtain more consistent protein migration.Here, ethanol can be used in place of methanol.In this chapter a PVDF membrane is used. Alternatively, a nitrocellulose membrane can also be used as we have found that such membrane type can also allow transfer of coronavirus spike protein bands.Gels and membranes dry easily. As much as possible, avoid leaving them to dry in air and handle them within containers with buffer solution.Due to their size and heavy glycosylation status, full-length MERS-CoV spike proteins (and most other coronavirus spike proteins) are relatively large with monomers typically migrating with apparent molecular weight of around 180 kDa or more and require relatively long transfer times when performing \u201cwet\u201d transfers as presented here. We found that 3 h allows to properly transfer the protein from the gel to the PVDF membrane. This long transfer time typically leads to heating of the transfer tank and transfer solution. To avoid overheating and potential protein degradation, in addition to placing an ice pack in the transfer tank and using prechilled transfer buffer, we recommend encasing the tank within an ice bucket filled with ice. Another option is to perform the transfer in a refrigerated setting such as within a cold room.Here, BSA is used for preparing blocking solution (in TBS-T) as well as the diluent for antibody incubations. We have found that BSA at concentrations of 1\u20132% generally gives clear western blot images with low background signal. An alternative to BSA is to use powdered milk. The concentrations and conditions for incubations with TBS-T supplemented with powdered milk should be tested beforehand to check which one gives the best results in terms of western blot background.The dilutions and incubation times for the antibodies used in this protocol were chosen after testing different conditions in preliminary experiments. If other antibodies are used, we suggest to also perform such tests to determine which antibody dilutions and incubation times give the best results.The imaging method presented in this protocol uses a chemiluminescence imager. However, it\u2019s also possible to perform this using X-ray film and developer.The assay presented here confirms that in the absence of matriptase expression (Fig. 3b, lane -), the MERS-CoV spike protein is cleaved at the S1/S2 site by an intracellular protease (Fig. 3a, lane 0), most likely of the pro-protein convertase family (e.g., furin), as shown previously [17]. The analysis also reveals that upon expression of matriptase, there is dose-dependent increase in the detection of a MERS-CoV spike protein proteolytic fragment (S25) migrating at approximately 25 kDa (Fig. 3a, lanes 1\u2013200). In addition, the band signals corresponding to full-length (FL) and S1/S2-cleaved fragment (S1/S2) appear to decrease upon increased matriptase expression, a result which could indicate that high levels of matriptase expression (e.g., in the 100\u2013200 ng range) are associated with nonspecific degradation of MERS-CoV spike protein. This effect could also be due to the matriptase and MERS-CoV spike co-transfection conditions used here, and it would be interesting to compare these results with the proteolytic processing of matriptase during viral entry. In addition, matriptase is expressed in this system without its natural inhibitor, HAI-1, which potently regulates the enzyme\u2019s activity. It is also noteworthy to point out that even in conditions with very low amounts of transfected matriptase-encoding plasmid (e.g., 2 ng) the S25 band is detected, suggesting that matriptase may be highly processive for the MERS-CoV spike substrate, in the absence of inhibitor. The composition of S25, the associated matriptase cleavage site and the functional consequence of such cleavage await further elucidation.\n",

The asterisk (\u2217) denotes that for each matriptase encoding plasmid quantity a reciprocal amount of pcDNA3.1-empty vector should be added so that the total amount plasmid DNA remains constant at 200 ng (e.g., for the 10 ng matriptase encoding plasmid condition, there should be 200\u201310 = 190 ng of pcDNA3.1 empty vector added)",

The amount of MERS-CoV spike-encoding plasmid is kept constant while the quantity of human matriptase encoding plasmid is gradually increased from 0 to 200 ng as shown on the blue scale triangle. 24 h post-transfection cells are lysed, lysates processed and analyzed by western blot using rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against MERS-CoV spike protein ectodomain (see note 17 for a summary of the results obtained). FL: full-length spike protein; S1/S2: S1/S2-cleaved fragment. (b) Matriptase expression in transfected cells. To check for protease expression in HEK-293 T/17 cells after transfection of matriptase-encoding plasmid (+, 500 ng) or pcDNA3.1 empty vector control (\u2212, 500 ng), transfected cells were lysed and analyzed by western blot using mouse monoclonal antibodies specific for detecting human matriptase. A strong band was detected for the condition where the human matriptase-encoding plasmid was used for transfection. This band migrated at approximately 90 kDa, which corresponds to the expected apparent molecular weight of human matriptase",
