            "text": "However, no more than 15 % of general population patients with aPLs develop thrombosis [6]. Indeed, \u03b22-GPI does not bind to unstimulated endothelium in vivo [11]. This observation lead to propose the \u201ctwo-hit\u201d hypothesis to explain the only occasionally clinical observation of thrombotic events in spite of the persistent presence of aPLs in these patients [12]. In this hypothesis, a \u201cfirst hit\u201d would induce a thrombophilic state but clotting would take place only in the presence of a \u201csecond hit.\u201d This \u201csecond hit\u201d would be another thrombophilic condition that increases the risk for clot formation. The presence of an environmental trigger as a \u201csecond hit\u201d has been reported in more than half of cases with CAPS [5]. The most frequent precipitating factor reported are infections, especially in the pediatric age [3, 13]. In this regard, both human monoclonal IgM and polyclonal IgG anti-\u03b22-GPI antibodies were found to induce an endothelial signal similar to that induced through toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) activation. The TLR are a type of pattern recognition receptors. These are transmembrane receptors that recognize molecules that are broadly shared by pathogens but different from host molecules, collectively referred as pathogen-associated molecular patterns [14]. TLR4 is known to be essential for innate immune response to components of bacteria, mycobacteria, yeast, and virus [15]. It is expressed in the innate immune system cells surface and EC [16] and is known to be the main receptor in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) signal transduction [17]. Ligand binding to TLR4 triggers the MyD88-dependent pathway finally leading to NF-\u03baB and AP-1 [8] activation and resulting in transcription of inflammatory genes [18]. On the other hand, virtually all patients with sepsis have coagulation abnormalities [19]. These abnormalities range from subtle activation of coagulation only detectable by sensitive techniques through somewhat subclinical stronger coagulation activation evident by a small decrease in platelet count and prolongation of global clotting times to fulminant disseminated intravascular coagulation, characterized by widespread microthrombosis and profuse bleeding [20]. At the same time, proinflammatory cytokines are important in inducing a procoagulant effect by inducing tissue factor expression on mononuclear cells and EC, probably playing their role in increasing the risk for new thrombosis.",

Hematological malignancies are the oncological diseases more frequently associated with CAPS and, among them, Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. However, CAPS has been reported to be associated with carcinomas and sarcomas [23]. Malignancies have been linked to the development of circulating aPLs [24], and the increased risk of cancer patients to develop thrombosis is well known since last century when Trousseau described the development of thrombophlebitis in these patients [25]. Several reasons have been proposed to explain the increased risk of thrombosis in cancer patients. For instance, blood flow stasis due to vascular invasion, immobilization, upregulation of thrombophilic substances by both tumor and endothelial cells, chemotherapy, and central venous devices have been proposed as conditions that might explain the increased frequency of thrombosis in these patients.",

However, IVIG and plasma exchanges were found few years ago to be a useful complementary tool for the treatment of patients with CAPS [51]. Their high economic cost and low availability may limit their use in patients with CAPS [52]. In this sense, an algorithm for the treatment of CAPS was published in order to guide physician facing these patients and establish treatment priorities [53]. This algorithm proposed to start specific treatment by handling independently each one of the main pathologic pathways. The authors recommended starting on anticoagulation and steroids as soon as the catastrophic situation is suspected. The former is given in order to stop the thrombophilic state and promote clot lysis and the later to downregulate the cytokine storm thought to be the one responsible for SIRS. When the patient is thought to be in a life-threatening condition, the authors suggested adding treatment with IVIG and/or plasma exchanges [53]. In case of active lupus manifestations, treatment with cyclophosphamide should be considered due to the better prognosis of these when they are treated with this drug. Cyclophosphamide is a nitrogen mustard-alkylating agent that binds to deoxyribonucleic acid in immune cells leading to cell death. Cyclophosphamide, probably, promotes the proliferation of T cells, suppression of helper Th1 activity, and enhances Th2 response (Fig. 20.1) [54].\n\n",
