URTI is the main cause of asthma exacerbations in children and adults and a major risk factor for admission in hospital every autumn. Asthmatic patients are concerned about acute asthma exacerbations following a common cold, asking how to minimize the risk during the winter viral season. Acute exacerbations are associated with decreased lung growth and, as such, add to both the cost and morbidity associated with asthma. Viral respiratory infections are the most common cause of asthma exacerbations in children (80-85%) and are a major risk factor for admission to a hospital. HRVs are the most common viral agents. Current drugs for the prevention and treatment of virus-induced exacerbation of asthma are poorly effective, and novel alternative therapies are needed. There are a growing number of clinical trials using probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics for the prevention of respiratory infections in asthmatic individuals. Proposed mechanisms include probiotics compete against pathogens; increase the barrier function in respiratory epithelium; immunostimulatory effects by enhancing cellular immunity with increased activity of natural killer cells and macrophages in airways (Hales et al., 2012, Holt and Sly, 2011).",

Epidemiological studies have shown an increased risk of asthma with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) caused by HRV even more than RSV. It is proposed that a synergistic interaction exists between viral infection and allergic sensitization, suggesting a \u201ctwo hit\u201d model for induction of persistent asthma. This information provides a series of novel strategies for the primary prevention of asthma by the prevention of either allergic sensitization or LRTI by probiotics or immunostimulants (Ahanchian et al., 2012).",

In an experimental model of lung inflammation based on the administration of the artificial viral pathogen-associated molecular pattern, in order to mimic the proinflammatory and physiopathological consequences of RNA viral infections in the lung, after oral administration of Lactobacillus rhamnosus CRL 1505 and CRL 1506, the authors found that CRL 1506 had no effect, whereas CRL 1505 increased bronchoalveolar lavage concentrations of interleukin (IL)-6, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-10, and the number of pulmonary CD3+CD4+IFN-\u03b3+ T cells. The preventive effects on the respiratory airway immunity induced by CRL 1505 suggested that, if the target of probiotic administration is to prevent recurrent URTIs, an appropriate strain of L. rhamnosus should be selected (Esposito et al., 2014). Zelaya et al. (2014) demonstrated that the preventive treatment with the probiotic bacteria beneficially modulates the fine tune balance between clearing respiratory viruses (RSV and influenza virus) and controlling immune-coagulative responses in the lung, allowing normal lung function to be maintained in the face of a viral attack. Their data also pinpoint a crucial role for IL-10 in the immune protection induced by L. rhamnosus CRL 1505 during respiratory viral infections.",

They may influence host innate and T-cell responses during a respiratory viral infection by modulation of the Th1/Th2 responses in the lungs. The innate immune system of the gut may be improved by prebiotics. Several studies report an increase in intestinal mucosal surface IgA but not serum concentration of IgA, IgG, and IgM.

However, probiotics decreased the presence of picornaviruses after 3 months, which may imply that probiotics play a role against viruses causing the common cold (Lehtoranta et al., 2014a). In male elite distance runners, L. fermentum reduced the duration of RTI symptoms, but not the incidence of RTIs or the severity of symptoms (Cox et al., 2010). A recent systematic review performed by King et al. revealed significantly fewer numbers of days of illness per person, shorter illness episodes by almost a day, and fewer numbers of days absent from work in participants who received a probiotic intervention than in those who had taken a placebo (King et al., 2014).",

It may be too soon to judge the role that probiotics may play in the prevention of the common cold because there are many strains of probiotics with established immunomodulatory effects yet to be tried with the particular goal of seeking their effects on respiratory infections. A better understanding of the effects of different probiotic strains and their combination, selection of the most beneficial strains, the dose and timing of supplementation for various age groups, and a deeper insight into their mechanisms of action are needed for the validation of specific strains carrying a potential to modify the frequency and severity of RTIs (Homayouni Rad et al., 2013). Functional foods such as probiotic milk or yogurt containing well-defined probiotic strains may reduce the risk of catching the common cold and represent a simple, safe, effective, and available method for preventing respiratory infections especially in developing countries. Further research to establish the role of probiotics and prebiotics in the treatment and prevention of RTIs is required and should also clarify if any susceptible subgroups of respiratory diseases exist, and how these subgroups benefit from supplementation with certain probiotic strains.",
