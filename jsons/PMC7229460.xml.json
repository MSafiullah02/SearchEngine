Now, the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic could overwhelm the frail health systems found in several LMICs, inevitably wiping out the already limited and scanty surgical healthcare services in many countries around the world. This situation calls for the need to reflect on the consequences of the pandemic on emergency and essential surgical care, especially in LMICs, and to elaborate on solutions to prevent and minimize them.",

Though the need for trauma care for road traffic incidents may have declined due to COVID19 response measures of quarantine and self-isolate, emergency and essential surgical healthcare will remain a significant need due to other indications.5 These include difficult and complicated childbirth, acute abdomen, falls, burns, strokes, aortic dissections, myocardial infarctions, and soft tissue infections, amongst many other conditions. It is estimated that 15% of pregnancies require surgical care, including the management of postpartum hemorrhage, obstructed labor, and cesarean sections.6 Children continue to be born with congenital defects that require lifesaving surgical management, including congenital heart defects, gastroschisis, neural tube defects, and other conditions. Failure to manage these surgical conditions would result in decreased quality of life, increased morbidity, and many lives lost. Conversely, by still managing these patients during the current pandemic, infection risks may be heightened amongst healthcare professionals due to higher viral load as a result of prolonged exposure and limited personal protective equipment (PPE). Moreover, the positive pressure maintained in the few well-equipped operating rooms in LMICs, and the experimental evidence suggesting potential airborne and, especially, surface stability of SARS-CoV-2 is of concern--creating a potential wind tunnel of viral particles.7\n",

In most epicenters worldwide, the explosive number of COVID-19 patients has pulled surgical staff out of operating rooms into the emergency department and intensive care units (ICUs). Although health workers fight to contain COVID-19 and treat the most vulnerable and critical patients, they are at heightened risk of becoming infected themselves--ultimately turning into disease vectors themselves. As PPE constraints grow, the number of infections of health care workers grows accordingly. In Spain and Italy, 10-15% of all SARS-CoV-2 infections were frontline health care workers taking care of patients.8\n,\n9 In Wuhan, the first days and weeks of the outbreak before the true gravity was known, patients were operated on non-stop until it became clear that surgical providers were becoming infected one by one.10 In Boston, a city that is comparatively well-resourced in terms of health infrastructure and systems, more than 150 health care workers tested positive for COVID-19 early in the US outbreak, whereas cities across the US have been witnessing the first deaths of healthcare workers.11\n,\n12 It is to be expected that these developments have even more grave consequences in LMICs, where the luxury does not exist to pull the limited surgical workforce out of the operating rooms whilst maintaining emergency and essential surgical care delivery, and where screening, testing, and PPE is even less accessible.",

While most LMICs have yet to climb the curve as North America and Europe, others are racing steeply upwards.13 For instance, as of May 9th, 2020, Iran has surpassed 106,000 reported cases while Turkey and Brazil keep ascending with over 137,000 and 148,000 confirmed cases, respectively, with potentially much higher numbers given limited testing capacity.13 Unfortunately, unless stringent precautions are taken, it will be only a matter of time before the virus floods LMIC hospitals, where healthcare workers, especially those involved in emergency and surgical care, will be significantly exposed to COVID-19. This may have unprecedented ramifications for the surgical workforce in LMICs. The Lancet Commission on Global Surgery estimated a need of 20 surgeons, anesthesiologists, and obstetricians (SAO) per 100,000 population for LMICs to strive for, in order to meet the growing burden of surgical disease.2 Today, low-income countries average only 1 SAO per 100,000 population, whereas lower-middle-income countries have 10 SAO per 100,000 population.2 While data on LMIC ICU capacities are scarce, it is estimated at 0.1 to 2.5 ICU beds per 100,000 population, which is not comparable to high-income countries, with 5 to 30 ICU beds per 100,000 population.14 Disturbingly, Italy, with 12.5 ICU beds per 100,000 population, is completely overrun, whereas New York State, with 15.4 per 100,000, is slowly facing a similar fate.15\n,\n16 More recent data suggest even worse indices for LMICs: excluding South Africa, sub-Saharan African countries have a density of less than five ICU beds per 100,000 population.17 Similarly, ventilators are a scarce resource: cries for more ventilators stem from both Italy (5 ventilators per 100,000 population) and the United States (51.3 per 100,000 population in New York State), whereas LMICs rely on barely 1 per 100,000 population;16\n,\n18\n,\n19 Mali, for example, only has one ventilator per million population.19\n",

This potential shortage of both qualified personnel and resources means that LMICs may face more severe versions of the ethical dilemmas faced in Europe and, increasingly, North America at a sooner rate. Reports from Italy indicate the need to ration ICU beds and ventilators based on expected clinical outcomes, commonly prioritizing younger patients and those with fewer comorbidities. In response, ethical principles and rationing guidelines have been released in the United States to ensure that clinicians and facilities can cope with the anticipated overwhelm.20 While clinicians in the United States, Spain, and Italy risk their lives intubating patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure one after another, a lack of workforce and necessary equipment means that a similar spike could happen in low-income countries; respiratory failure, then, would automatically be a death sentence. Socioeconomic extremes within fee-for-service, fragmented, and nascent health systems will become an additional challenge for accessing health care, where disparities will further fall most heavily on the poorest and most marginalized. This is further illustrated by the difficulty of local populations to quarantine and isolate, as a large part of LMIC populations live on, at most, a few dollars per day, not having the luxury to remain at home. Crowded urban neighborhoods further complicate social distancing, posing threats to the proposed public health measures.",

Decades of resource constraints and the fight against endemic infectious diseases and outbreaks have led to the development of robust public health surveillance systems and innovation in rapidly deploying population-level interventions to mitigate spread.24 As a result, LMICs have already empowered their communities to work within and beyond structures of the local health system to spread community awareness, especially in times of crisis.25 The Ebola outbreaks in West and Central Africa, including the prominent 2014-2015 outbreak, have brought important lessons on adequately maintaining hygiene and ensuring swift contact tracing--crucial, especially so with a condition as fatal as Ebola.26 In Southeast Asia, the SARS and MERS epidemics equipped countries with emergency preparedness plans to swiftly identify asymptomatic carriers at the borders, whilst normalizing a culture of public mask-wearing.27\n,\n28 This latter practice indirectly maintained large volumes of surgical and N95 masks in stock. Previous crisis experiences primed authorities and populations in LMICs for better cohesion towards public health rules, which contrasts with the tempered approach in several North American epicenters. Furthermore, as LMIC surgeons face a chronic shortage in personnel and resources, prioritizing and task-shifting are everyday practices, even though the weight of the pandemic will require further adaptation for this scarce workforce. The COVID-19 pandemic can highlight the value of the surgical system as a source of immediate treatment capacity. As such, building up surgical capacity in the LMIC serves to improve surgical access but also contributes to pandemic readiness.",

Low-resource settings have been breeding grounds for innovative ideas, often having to rely on ingenious methods to provide the care that is needed--for example, finding means to sterilize and re-use equipment and consumables. Now, with the need to find solutions to an impending shortage of ventilators, lessons may be learned from our colleagues in LMICs to develop low-cost, rapid, and temporary solutions to develop make-shift ventilators and maximize treatment capacity. A prime example has been the recent development of a multidisciplinary collaborative involving the surgical innovation team and the department of surgery at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital to produce quality N95-like masks costing only 3 US dollars per unit, in response to the emergent lack in PPE.29 Besides material needs, HICs can also inspire themselves from LMICs\u2019 task-sharing and task-shifting practices both within and beyond the surgical ecosystem.30 This practice could imply a temporary change in the skill set of non-physician health care professionals in carrying out simple but necessary tasks and assignments in response to the shortage of physician staff in hospitals.",
