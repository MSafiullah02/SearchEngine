The influenza viruses A, B, and C are the three most important genera of Orthomyxoviridae, a group of single-stranded minus-sense RNA viruses with a segmented genome. The eight RNA segments of the influenza A virus genome encode 11 viral proteins. These include the polymerase proteins (PB1, PB2, PA, PB1-F2), nucleocapsid protein, hemagglutinin, neuraminidase, matrix proteins (M1, M2), and nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2). Hemagglutinin and neuraminidase are the major antigenic determinants of influenza A viruses and serve as the basis for their subtype classification. There are 16 hemagglutinin (H1 to H16) and 9 neuraminidase types (N1 to N9). Hemagglutinin mediates attachment to and entry of the virus into host cells by binding to sialic acid receptors at the cell surface. Hemagglutinin is also the main viral target of protective humoral immunity by neutralizing antibody. The binding affinity of hemagglutinin to the sialic acid residues partly accounts for the host specificity of the various influenza A virus subtypes. Human viruses preferentially bind to sialic acid linked to galactose by \u03b1-2,6 linkages that are the main type found on the epithelial cells of the human respiratory tract, while avian viruses tend to bind to \u03b1-2,3 linkages that are found on duck intestinal epithelium.1\n2 The specificity for different receptors has long been one of the explanations for the species barrier between avian and human influenza viruses. The presence of both \u03b1-2,3 and \u03b1-2,6 linkages in the pig tracheal epithelium is the reason why pigs may serve as the \u201cmixing vessel\u201d for the genesis of new viral types through co-infection.2 Chickens may have a similar role, in that their lung and intestinal epithelia contain both types of linkages.3 In the human respiratory epithelium, it has been shown that \u03b1-2,3 and \u03b1-2,6 linkages are found on ciliated and nonciliated cells, respectively, thereby allowing human infection by avian influenza viruses.4\n5 The change of one amino acid of the H5 protein is sufficient to change the receptor binding specificity of A/H5N1 viruses.6 Thus, the barrier to interspecies infection can be overcome easily.",

            "text": "The other notable feature of influenza A viruses is their propensity to undergo antigenic variations through antigenic drift and antigenic shift. Antigenic drift represents relatively minor alterations in the antigenicity of hemagglutinin or neuraminidase by mutation. This occurs continuously as a result of selection pressure from the host immunity and explains the need for yearly changes in the human influenza vaccine composition. For example, the H3N2 component of the vaccine for the Northern Hemisphere 2005\u20132006 season is changed to A/California/7/2004(H3N2), as compared to A/Fujian/411/2002(H3N2) used in the 2004\u20132005 season. Antigenic shift by genetic reassortment of the eight gene segments can result in the appearance of a novel hemagglutinin/neuraminidase combination for which the human population has little or no immunity. The appearance of such novel antigenic types may lead to pandemics of influenza if such strains can be transmitted efficiently from human to human. Major pandemics have occurred in the last century, in 1918\u20131919 (H1N1), 1957 (H2N2), and 1968 (H3N2). However, it is also possible that a pandemic virus is generated by mere mutation of an avian influenza virus such as the A/H5N1, which adapts to the human host without genetic reassortment.",

Traditionally, southern China is considered to be the epicenter for both human and highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses. Circulation of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses among avian species, domestic mammals, and farm workers have been documented in this region.23 Since 2004, the A/H5N1 virus has been stretching its borders northwards and westwards, and avian infection has now been described in western China, Mongolia, Russia, Kazakhstan, Inner Mongolia, Turkey, and Romania. This puts an increasingly larger human population at risk of infection. Secondly, genetic changes of the contemporary viruses and a changing ecology with different animals are evident. Since 2002, waterfowl in Hong Kong started to succumb to A/H5N1 infections. This is also seen in the current epidemic in Eurasia. Studies24\n25 of A/H5N1 viruses collected from 2003\u20132004 in Southeast Asia showed that these viruses infect not only the intestinal tract but also the respiratory tract of ducks, with a higher viral load at the trachea than the cloaca. Viruses may be shed for up to 17 days after infection of the ducks (in contrast to 2 to 5 days in older studies). More importantly, they demonstrated increased virulence to mammals as shown in animal studies10\n26\n27\n28\n29 and natural infection of caged felines in endemic areas. This increase in virulence has been associated with specific amino acid changes in the sequence of the PB2 protein (such as aspartic acid to asparagine at position 701 and glutamic acid to lysine at position 627).10\n29\n30\n31 Disseminated extrapulmonary infection, including the brain, was demonstrated in mice and ferrets.29 Since 1997, the Z genotype of A/H5N1 viruses has emerged as the predominant virus in southern China and many Z genotype strains also carry M2 gene mutations, thereby conferring resistance to the adamantanes.7\n",

The reason for severe disease and high mortality in A/H5N1 infections that surpasses the previous pandemics of human influenza is not known. The presence of a new viral subtype to which the human host has no prior immunity cannot totally explain this phenomenon. The ability of the virus to cause disseminated infection\u2014including viremia and encephalitis\u2014could be an important factor.

The frontline clinicians should therefore always try to elicit a detailed history of travel and exposure to animals in suspected patients. Those with a positive travel or contact history should receive appropriate radiologic and microbiological investigations, together with proper infection control precautions. Patients with mild influenza-like illness may be isolated and closely observed while waiting for results of laboratory investigations. A chest radiograph should be performed to exclude pulmonary involvement. The decision for hospitalization is based on a clinical assessment of disease severity, whether the patient can be readily followed up, and the likelihood of having avian influenza infection.

Adamantanes are active against influenza A viruses, while neuraminidase inhibitors are active against both influenza A and B viruses. Adamantanes are currently not considered to be the drug of choice for avian influenza virus infections because of two reasons. Firstly, adamantane resistance emerges rapidly following therapeutic use in human influenza, and the resistant viruses are fully transmissible and pathogenic. Up to 30% of patients with human influenza A being treated with amantadine may shed resistant viruses, sometimes as early as day 2 to 3 after treatment.49 Such adamantane-resistant viruses can readily be transmitted to contacts. Secondly, recent isolates of A/H5N1 from the Indochina clade in Cambodia-Thailand-Vietnam often carry mutations in the M2 gene, thereby rendering this group of antiviral agents ineffective in the treatment and prevention of this emerging epidemic.7 But it is important to note that the China-Indonesia clade are still quite susceptible to amantadine. Thus, adamantanes should still be considered for prophylaxis in the community contacts if the pandemic strain is still susceptible. The long shelf life of amantadine of > 25 years and its low cost make it an attractive choice for stockpiling.",

Protective efficacy diminished substantially when neuraminidase inhibitors were administered > 60 h after infection. However, the length of this window of opportunity for human avian influenza infection is currently unknown. In the Thai series in 2004, patients who had survived after oseltamivir treatment appeared to have received the agent earlier than those who subsequently died (4.5 days vs 9 days after disease onset).40 The benefits of early antiviral intervention may be nullified by the fact that patients with influenza-like illness early in the course of disease often do not seek medical attention, and patients in remote or rural areas of developing countries often have delayed access to medical services.",

Nevertheless, an oseltamivir-resistant A/H5N1 isolate was recently described in Vietnam.36 In this report,36 an oseltamivir-resistant A/H5N1 virus was isolated from a symptomatic girl who had received 4 days of postexposure oseltamivir prophylaxis (75 mg qd). The virus had a histidine-to-tyrosine substitution at position 274 of the neuraminidase protein, and the IC50 for oseltamivir was found to be 90 nmol/L, still within clinically achievable peak plasma level of oseltamivir. The girl subsequently received a therapeutic dose of oseltamivir (75 mg bid) for 7 days, and no viruses were then isolated. This level of resistance apparently did not lead to treatment failure in this case, although it is impossible to draw definite conclusions based on a single case report. One of the viral clones of the girl\u2019s isolate, however, has an IC50 for oseltamivir of > 763 nmol/L. Extensive use of oseltamivir for the treatment of human influenza in children has been shown to be associated with a substantial risk of resistance developing to the agent.57 Therefore, it will hardly be surprising to see more oseltamivir-resistant A/H5N1 viruses when the number of human cases increases and the use of this drug for prophylactic or therapeutic purposes becomes more common. Other strategies for antiviral therapy and prophylaxis are urgently required.",

The findings of this study is definitely worth exploring in humans in order to determine the optimal dosing of oseltamivir for avian influenza, which most likely requires higher doses than currently recommended dosages for human influenza. Increased dose is especially indicated in patients with a high viral load due to delayed presentation, severe diseases with shock, or poor oral drug absorption as a result of severe diarrhea. Although oseltamivir has been administered in high doses to healthy volunteers at supratherapeutic doses without significant adverse reactions,77 any potential toxicity associated with high-dose regimens must be closely monitored in therapeutic trials.",

One option is to use a combination of oseltamivir and probenecid to double the systemic exposure following a conventional dosage of oseltamivir.78 Another option is to use combination therapy with two neuraminidase inhibitors, one neuraminidase inhibitor plus one adamantane if the circulating genotype is susceptible to adamantanes, or one neuraminidase inhibitor plus ribavirin (or viramidine when it becomes available). The synergistic effects of these combinations, if any, need to be studied urgently by in vitro and animal studies. Ribavirin has been used in the treatment of human influenza A virus infections, usually administered orally or by aerosolization, and occasionally by the IV route for severe infections or in immunocompromised hosts. A consistent benefit has not been observed in clinical studies, and currently ribavirin is not considered to be a drug of choice for influenza A infection. There are only limited in vitro data on the activity of ribavirin on avian influenza viruses.73 But ribavirin was shown to be highly effective in reducing mortality in a mannan-enhanced mice model infected by influenza B even when treatment was delayed for 3 days after the infection, when oseltamivir treatment is no longer effective. Combination of oseltamivir with ribavirin treatment started at such delayed timing does not increase the efficacy in this mice model. Viramidine is a carboxamidine analog of ribavirin that also demonstrates broad-spectrum antiviral activities like ribavirin. Its anti-influenza activity has been confirmed in limited in vitro and animal studies.73 Viramidine is currently not licensed for clinical use.",

This mode of delivery for zanamivir could be problematic in certain populations such as the very young and old patients, the intubated patients, and those who are severely ill who are not able to inhale the powder properly. Oseltamivir is easier to administer and theoretically more effective when there is systemic infection or severe pneumonia (with collapse and/or consolidation of the lungs that could hinder penetration of inhaled zanamivir). However, both neuraminidase inhibitors need to be available because cross-resistance between the two neuraminidase inhibitors is incomplete. For example, the oseltamivir-resistant A/H5N1 isolate from Vietnam described above remains fully susceptible to zanamavir. A healthy reserve of zanamivir not only relieves the tension over oseltamivir supply but may also prove necessary when oseltamivir-resistant viruses become prevalent in the future. Zanamavir should be considered for prophylaxis in health-care workers taking care of patients receiving treatment with oseltamivir for avian influenza. Zanamivir may be used for prophylaxis or treatment of less severely ill patients because higher blood levels of the drug may not be needed (the blood level of zanamivir is almost 5 times lower than that of oseltamivir). However, oseltamivir may be reserved for patients with systemic infection or severe pneumonia who require higher blood levels. It is unfortunate that other formulations of zanamivir and the newer agent peramivir are not commercially available. In preclinical trials, IV zanamivir, even when administered at doses up to 1,200 mg/d, was very well tolerated and achieves very high blood and respiratory secretion levels; protective efficacy was also demonstrated in experimental human infections.61\n67 The role of combinations of neuraminidase inhibitors are uncertain, as is the case of combinations with other groups of antivirals. However, a low serum level of inhaled zanamivir in patients with consolidated lungs may theoretically promote the emergence of zanamivir resistant virus that is cross-resistant to oseltamivir.",

For patients suspected or confirmed of having avian influenza, the WHO recommended contact and droplet precautions as key measures.85 Airborne precautions are also recommended because of the high mortality and the ability of human influenza viruses to be transmitted by droplet nuclei. The relative importance of these routes of transmission are uncertain at present. The findings of GI involvement by A/H5N1 viruses and the prominent diarrhea with a high fecal viral load in some patients should be not be overlooked. A similar combination of clinicopathologic findings during the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong led to an unprecedented outbreak in a housing estate via airborne transmission of a virus-laden aerosol plume generated from a faulty sewage system.84 Besides hospital-acquired infections, laboratory-acquired infections during the postmortem examination of A/H7N2-infected seals have been reported. The 1977 A/H1N1 strain was believed to have been originated from a laboratory in Russia. In 2005, an isolate of A/H2N2 virus was erroneously sent to laboratories in 18 countries in a proficiency testing program. Therefore, faulty laboratory precautions can also be a source for pandemics. Avian influenza viruses are readily inactivated by common disinfectants, and the WHO presently recommends the use of 1% sodium hypochlorite or 70% alcohol for disinfection.85\n86\n87\n",

Vaccines are probably the most effective means of specific protection, but the ability to produce effective vaccines on time will limit their role in the early phase of the pandemic. Indiscriminate use of neuraminidase inhibitors for human influenza virus infection should be discouraged because this will inevitably promote the emergence of neuraminidase inhibitor-resistant influenza viruses.57 Another potential concern is the reassortment between neuraminidase inhibitor-resistant A/H1N1 or A/H3N2 virus with A/H5N1 virus, resulting in neuraminidase inhibitor-resistant A/H5N1 reassortants with enhanced human-to-human transmissibility. Studies need to be done urgently to include the role of combination antiviral therapy in treating severe infections and its ability to prevent the emergence of resistant strains of viruses. The efficacy of other agents such as ribavirin (by aerosolization or systemic administration), either alone or in combinations, should be explored. Antiviral susceptibility testing must be performed on new epidemic strains, as not all A/H5N1 viruses are resistant to adamantanes (our unpublished data, 2001). While oseltamivir is toxic to newborn rats at a dose 250 times higher than the recommended pediatric dosage, the use of oseltamivir in infants < 1 year old has not been shown to be neurotoxic. This should be confirmed by larger clinical trials.94\n95 Efforts to avert or minimize the impact of the impending pandemic should not be based solely on therapeutic measures. Simple community infection control and personal hygienic measures are important for respiratory infections, as shown in the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in 2003.96 Human avian infection is currently limited to close contacts with infected animals. For travelers to endemic areas of avian influenza, avoiding close contacts with poultry or wild birds could significantly reduce the risk of infection.",
