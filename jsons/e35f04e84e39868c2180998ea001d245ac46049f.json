            "text": "The COVID-19 pneumonia was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei province in China in late December 2019. The disease has since quickly spread worldwide, and has been declared a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) by the World Health Organization (WHO) [1] . According to current evidence, COVID-19 is mainly transmitted with close contact through respiratory droplets (such as coughing) and by fomites [2] . Pregnancy presents a unique immunological situation, characterized by increased susceptibility to some infectious diseases, including respiratory pathogens. Pregnant women could hence be at higher risk of severe acute respiratory disease coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection compared to the general population [3] . In previous pandemics such as H1N1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), pregnant women seemed to have poor clinical and obstetric outcomes and higher mortality compared to non-pregnant women [4] . Nonetheless, the even limited data available on COVID-19 in pregnant women would suggest that these patients have similar clinical course as nonpregnant women [5] , despite concerns for possibility of increased risk of preterm delivery and low birth weight [6] . The potential of vertical mother-to-child transmission of COVID-19 infection is also still unclear. We therefore analyzed current literature to identify any evidence of vertical transmission.",
