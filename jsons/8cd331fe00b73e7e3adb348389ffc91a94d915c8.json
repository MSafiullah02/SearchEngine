(2) Patients infected with the novel infl uenza A(H1N1) virus have more heterogeneous hypoxemic ARF than patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure.

NIMV was initiated using bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP) mode S/T (spontaneous/timed) with a respiratory rate of 15. It had a programmed tidal volume (Vt) of 200 ml exhaled for a 42-kg patient and 300 ml for a 60-kg patient, each infected with infl uenza A novel associated H1N1 and chronic lung disease. The average volume-assured pressure support (AVAPS) ventilatory strategy was useful in patients with COPD exacerbation, infection, asthma, and those with mild forms of novel infl uenza A(H1N1) infection. The S/T-BIPAP + AVAPS ventilation strategy allows a fi xed preset tidal volume that is maintained constant under inspiratory pressure variations. (BiPAP S/T) with average volume assured pressure support (AVAPS) allows for setting a fi xed tidal volume, and the system output automatically adjusts based on variations in inspiratory pressure to ensure the predetermined target value. The initial ventilatory parameters must be programmed in mode BIPAP-S/T + AVAPS with an inspiratory pressure (IPAP) of 18-26 cmH 2 O and a minimum of 12 applications scheduled as well as positive expiratory pressure (EPAP) of 6-8 cmH 2 O for a programmed tidal volume corresponding to 45.5 + 0.91 (height in cmt -152.4). 8-10 ml/kg body weight per patient.

In the LOVS study, the authors compared 10 vs. 16 cmH 2 O of PEEP in patients who had low tidal volume. Amato et al.'s patient group was employed as the controls. The EXPRESS study employed the ARDS Network protocol control group and compared PEEP levels of 7 vs. 15 cmH 2 O. Mortality was similar in the three studies. In the ALVEOLI study clinical outcomes were similar whether lower or higher PEEP levels were used. A recent meta-analysis [ 19 ] examined three trials involving 2,299 patients and demonstrated that high PEEP levels was not associated with improved hospital survival. This protective ventilatory strategy has traditionally been associated with reduced mortality. It should be noted, however, that several recent meta-analyses of randomized trials using ventilatory strategies to protect the tidal volume in the lungs demonstrated that it is not the most important parameter. They concluded that the driving pressure is the difference between the plateau pressure and PEEP during controlled ventilation, which is therefore the most important parameter to optimize [ 20 ] .",

APRV is a time-triggered, pressure-cycled ventilation mode that allows spontaneous breaths throughout the respiratory cycle. It has been widely used in patients with ARDS and has been observed to improve oxygenation. It also reduces the need for sedation and paralysis. During APRV, pressure in the airway is scheduled on two levels called P high and P low and into two periods called T high and T low . They are analogous to inspiratory pressure, PEEP, inspiratory time, and expiratory time, respectively. There are no conclusive data pertaining to whether APRV improves or worsens the results in patients with lung injury, particularly because the combination of pressure and the controlled mode can produce unpredictable spontaneous breaths and tidal volumes. It is known that high tidal volumes are associated with worse ARDS outcomes [ 24 ] .",
