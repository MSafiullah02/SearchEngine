            "text": "There are few specific signs or symptoms that are unique to any one virus. In general, respiratory viral infections trigger the release of local and systemic cytokines that generally are responsible for the signs and symptoms of respiratory viral infections that patients may experience. Given that similar cytokines are released in response to the various respiratory viruses, the clinical picture often is clinically challenging to discriminate. As a result, a specific diagnosis of the infecting virus requires laboratory techniques. In general, a diagnosis can be made through detection of serologic responses to viral infection, detection of virally encoded proteins (antigen detection), detection of viral RNA/DNA, or through cell culture. Serology typically is limited to studies because it requires collection of acute (at time of illness) and convalescent (4-6 weeks after recovery) antibody titers. As such, it is of limited benefit for an acute diagnosis and transplant patients may fail to mount a normal antibody response. Historically, viral cultures were considered the gold standard, but the advent of molecular diagnostics has shown that viral cultures have variable sensitivity of certain viruses and may miss 5% to 70% of infections. The cultures are laborious and can take 2 to 7 days to become positive. Rapid shell vial culture techniques provide more rapid results and enhanced sensitivity by concentrating the virus and using antigen detection. Viral antigens can be detected by fluorescent antibodies applied to primary clinical specimens or culture, or by colorimetric detection of specific viral proteins. They generally have the advantage of providing relatively rapid results but may have limited sensitivity, particularly in the case of rapid antigen detection methods in adult transplant recipients. Molecular diagnostics (ie, polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) have become more widely available and have the advantage of allowing multiplexing and thereby detecting multiple viruses in one test. In addition, these assays generally have the highest sensitivity of available diagnostic testing. It is important to remember, however, that despite the excellent sensitivity, poorly collected samples may yield false-negative results and that patients with lower respiratory tract infection may have negative testing of upper respiratory tract specimens. Finally, the diagnostic sensitivity for individual viruses varies by the specific assay being used as well. As a result, diligent collection of specimens and knowledge of the limitations of the assay used by your laboratory are essential for interpreting the results.",

            "text": "For both influenza and RSV, a large number of rapid antigen assays are available for the rapid detection of the specific virus. Although a positive result generally represents true infection, these assays have poor sensitivity, particularly in the immunocompromised adult patient.9, 10 Multiplex reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) tests are now the preferred way to diagnose influenza and parainfluenza in the transplant setting even though they do require more time, expertise, and specialized equipment.11 Although very sensitive and specific, variations in the genome of the virus infecting an individual patient can yield false-negative results on the RT-PCR tests.12 For the other respiratory viruses, PCR is the preferred diagnostic strategy because of low yields with culture and limited fluorescent antibody availability. Adenovirus is unique in that, although PCR is the preferred diagnostic test, negative testing from the upper or lower airway may not exclude infections.13, 14 Some assays detect some but not all of the serotypes.14 Furthermore, adenovirus replication can occur in the absence of clinical symptoms and positive testing must be contextualized with the patients presenting signs and symptoms. Adenovirus can cause a range of clinical diseases and respiratory involvement may occur late. As a result, detection of other compartments, including blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid, should be considered depending on the clinical presentation of the patient. Finally, unlike PCR assays for the other viruses, there are clear methodologies for quantitative viral load testing for adenovirus. Such quantitative viral load testing allows careful monitoring of trends to determine the need for antivirals, the case of persistent or increasing viral loads, and response to antiviral therapy. Finally, adenovirus diagnostics typically requires biopsies of involved tissues to assess for histopathologic changes compatible with adenovirus infection. Such pathology is helpful in distinguishing local infection (ie, adenovirus interstitial nephritis) from organ rejection or other pathology.14\n",

Cough (91% for adult and 92% for pediatric) and fever (80% for adult and 95% for pediatric) were the most common symptoms, although they were less common than in immunocompetent patients. Likewise, symptoms commonly associated with influenza such as myalgia (52% in adult and 49% in pediatric) and sore throat (35% for adult and 59% for pediatric) occurred infrequently in the transplant population. Sixty-one percent were lymphopenic at the time of presentation and 65% required hospitalization.40 Twenty-five percent developed pneumonia, typically viral pneumonia, and 13% were admitted to the intensive care unit.40\n",

Resistance should be considered in any patient who develops influenza after recent exposure to antiviral agents, used as either treatment or prophylaxis, or if there is failure to improve clinically despite 5 to 7 days of antiviral therapy.65 In addition, patients with prolonged shedding should be tested serially to detect emergence of resistance.65 When testing for resistance, either phenotypic assays or assays that genotypically can detect a wide range of mutations (ie, not just the H274Y mutation) should be used.65 As soon as resistance is considered, switching to an agent with predicted activity, typically zanamivir, should be considered.",

The proteins encoded include a transcription processivity factor (M2-1), a transcription regulatory protein (M2-2), and the matrix protein. There are proteins that along with M2-1 are associated with the RNA-containing nucleocapsid complex. These proteins are nucleoprotein, phosphoprotein, and polymerase proteins.

It is suspected that by 2 years of age most children will have experienced at least one RSV infection.75 In the United States the major RSV season typically runs from November to late March or early April. Although children are infected most often compared with adults, RSV infection can cause severe illness with high rates of morbidity and mortality in the elderly and immunocompromised, in particular, patients with lymphopenia.10, 76, 77 In the immunocompromised population, including stem cell transplant and solid-organ transplant (SOT) patients, RSV infection may progress to severe and life-threatening lower respiratory tract infection.76 At one center, SOT infection accounted for approximately half of their immunocompromised population infections.78 Depending on the transplanted organ, there is a wide range of mortality rates (0.4%-40%) in patients with solid-organ transplantation.76, 77, 79 The majority of the published literature regarding RSV infection and SOT has been in lung transplant patients. However, there are increasing data in renal transplant patients. Even without specific therapy, mortality from RSV infection in adult renal transplant patients has been low.80, 81\n",

Supportive therapy remains the mainstay of therapy.76 In the stem cell transplant population the use of therapy with ribavirin remains controversial.76 However, there are data to suggest that treatment with aerosolized ribavirin with or without an immunomodulator such as intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) can provide benefit, especially when treating upper respiratory tract disease to prevent progression to lower respiratory tract disease.85, 86, 87 There also are data supporting oral ribavirin use in the stem cell transplant population.88 In the solid-organ transplant population, treatment with antiviral agents and immunomodulators remains undefined.89 Much of the data regarding SOT and RSV therapy is in lung transplant patients. There is a paucity of data in renal transplant patients. In a subgroup of six renal transplant patients (one liver/kidney, one pancreas/kidney), three of six patients were treated using either inhaled (two of three) or oral (one of three) ribavirin. The liver/kidney patient did not receive any antiviral therapy. Only one patient received inhaled ribavirin and IVIG. The kidney/pancreas patient received inhaled ribavirin and palivizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against RSV. One kidney transplant patient received inhaled ribavirin, IVIG, and palivizumab. None of the six patients died. Five of the patients were on prednisone, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil. One patient was on mycophenolate mofetil and sirolimus.78 The duration of ribavirin (inhaled and/or oral) is generally 5 to 14 days.78, 86, 88 The data remain inconclusive on the outcome and mortality benefit of palivizumab as treatment for RSV in the stem cell and SOT population.84, 86, 90, 91, 92, 93 Duration of IVIG therapy (500 mg/kg every 48 hours) generally ranges from 1 to 6 days.84, 87\nTable 1 shows common treatment considerations in patients with moderate to severe infection caused by RSV.",

A total of 252 capsomere subunits form 20 surfaces and 12 vertices where penton and fiber proteins are located. The fiber protein is important for interaction with cellular receptors73 (\nFig. 2). There are seven subgroups, termed A through G, and 52 serotypes, in which there are different genotypes identified within the serotypes.14 Adenovirus is ubiquitous, with subtypes A, B, C, D, and E. Adenovirus is known to circulate globally and be implicated in outbreaks.95 Tissue tropism accounts for certain subgroups and serotypes correlating with different disease manifestations (\nTable 2). For example, disseminated disease has been associated with subgroups A, B2, C, and F.13, 14 Although subtype D is associated for the most part with epidemic keratoconjunctivitis, it has been shown to cause disseminated disease in a renal transplant patient.96 Hemorrhagic cystitis is associated with subgroups B1 and B2 and serotypes 7, 11, 34, and 25; respiratory tract disease is associated with subgroups B1, B2, C, and E, and serotypes 3, 4, 7, 11, 16, 21, 34, 35, and 50; and gastrointestinal disease is associated with subgroup F, serotypes 40, 41, and 52.13, 14\n",

In the immunocompromised populations, particularly in SOT patients, AdV typically involves the transplanted organ. Although infection tends to be less common and serious in renal transplant patients, mortality rates of up to 18% have been reported in renal transplant patients, and these patients have been shown to develop several AdV clinical diseases.73, 101 Common presentations of disease in renal allograft patients include hemorrhagic cystitis and interstitial nephritis.102 Symptoms of hemorrhagic cystitis typically include fever and hematuria, with or without dysuria or suprapubic pain. In interstitial nephritis, allograft biopsy findings are variable and can include interstitial infiltrates of lymphocytes, monocytes, plasma cells, and neutrophils. Viral inclusions may be observed, and granulomas may be present as well. The granulomatous changes and viral cytopathic effects can serve as an important clue in differentiating AdV infection from acute rejection. There is tubular cell necrosis with viral cytopathic effects, although the glomeruli appear to be free of inflammation. The blood vessels, for the most part, are free of inflammation, but rare findings of fibrin accumulations in the arterial walls has been described.14, 96, 103 Many of these infections are self-limiting, however, necrotizing tubulointerstitial nephritis, allograft dysfunction leading to dialysis, and obstructive uropathy can occur.95 Adenovirus upper respiratory tract disease, pneumonitis, gastrointestinal disease. and disseminated disease, in which two or more organs are effected, all have been described in renal transplant recipients as well.96, 100, 102\n",

The mainstay of treatment remains reduction of immunosuppression, although the optimal changes to the immunosuppressive regimen are not known.14 There remains no standard or consensus on the optimal antiviral medication regimen. The guanoside analog ribavirin has not been shown to be efficacious in AdV infection and is not recommended.13, 104 In vitro activity of ganciclovir against AdV has been reported, as have case reports in treating AdV infections.105, 106, 107 Although there are no prospective randomized clinical trials, there are data to support the use of the nucleoside analog of cytidine monophosphate, cidofovir, for AdV infection. It has become the standard of care in some medical centers.14 Cidofovir acts by promoting viral DNA chain termination because it is taken up as a substrate by the viral DNA polymerase.101 In immunocompromised populations cidofovir has been noted to decrease viral load. The decrease in viral load in turn also has correlated with clinical improvement.14, 95, 100, 108 There can be a significant risk of nephrotoxicity (up to 50%) with the use of cidofovir. The other significant side effects that should be monitored with the use of cidofovir include neutropenia (up to 25%), decreased intraocular pressure (24%), anterior uveitis (11%), and metabolic acidosis.14, 109 Currently, two main dosing regimens are supported by the literature. The first is a three times weekly regimen dosed at 1 mg/kg intravenously and the second is 5 mg/kg intravenously weekly. Initial dosing should continue for a minimum of 2 weeks followed by cidofovir 5 mg/kg intravenously every other week with monitoring for resolution of symptoms and three negative AdV PCRs from the originally affected sites.13, 14, 104, 110 Dosing adjustments must be made for renal function. Hemodialysis should be avoided for 1 hour before and 4 hours after dosing to allow for intracellular distribution of cidofovir.14 A lipid-linked derivative of cidofovir, brincidofovir (formerly CMX001; Chimerix, Durham, NC), has shown promise in its in vitro and in vivo activity against AdV. Brincidofovir\u2019s lipid moiety allows it to be administered orally rather than intravenously, allows it to enter cells readily, and, once the lipid moiety is cleaved, does not allow it to leave the cells easily.101, 111 Importantly and surprisingly given the parent compound, brincidofovir is non-nephrotoxic.112, 113 Use of IVIG or lymphocyte infusion remains controversial because it does not appear to have a clear benefit at this time.13, 95, 96, 100, 102, 104\n",
