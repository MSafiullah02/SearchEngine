CID foals should have no serum IgM at those times, but between these two periods passively transferred maternal IgM may be detected. IgM has a 4-5-day half-life and by 3 weeks of age a foal should therefore have eliminated more than 95% of the maternal IgM antibodies (Riggs 1987) , although serum IgM can occasionally be detected up to the age of 30-40 days (L.

Foal 3 at 3 months of age had no detectable IgG or IgM according to the RID assay, and consequently no y globulins in the electrophoretic analysis. However, total protein levels in Foal 3 were normal due to elevations of cx and p globulins, which were also evident in the other foals. These elevations may represent increased concentrations of inflammatory proteins whose production is unaffected by this condition. These 3 cases therefore demonstrate the utility of IgM assays in providing the earliest and most specific test of the foal's ability to produce immunoglobulins. Other tests of immunocompetence which assess the lymphoid system can be used to evaluate CIDsuspects.
