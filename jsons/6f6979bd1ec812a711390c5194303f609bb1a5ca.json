Community mitigation strategies refer to measures that people, and communities can take to slow the spread of infection during a period when vaccines and/or medical treatments that are not available [1] . They include the use of personal protective measures for everyday use (e.g., voluntary home isolation of ill persons, respiratory etiquette, and hand hygiene); community measures aimed at increasing social distancing (e.g., maintaining a physical distance of 1\u00b75-2\u00b70 meters between people, staying at home and postponing or cancelling gatherings); and environmental measures (e.g., routinely disinfecting surfaces). In some settings these strategies are voluntary, whereas in others they are now enforced (such as, via fines and/or jail time).",

However, the pattern of age is not straight forward. In contrast to the above studies, others have reported higher levels of adoption of preventive behaviors amongst younger people (18-24 years) in the context of the 2009 influenza pandemic. When it comes to gender, we found that females were more likely to report uptake of both preventive and avoidance behaviors, consistent with studies during SARS and H1N1 pandemic influenza [2, 5, 17, 26] . Earlier studies have indicated that women are more likely to perceive themselves to be susceptible and hence adopt the behaviors [15, 27] . When it comes to country of birth, we found that people born outside of Australia were less likely to adopt behaviors. This finding may relate to the capacity to access information, which at the time, was being disseminated in English and largely through mainstream media conferences and health department websites rather than community and language groups. Further work is needed to explore the associations between country of birth and pandemic-related behaviors.",

Mass media campaigns that frame their messages around a social collective action/power or the inclusion of the general public within a team to assist the community response may be effective. The promotion of prosocial behaviors has been shown to be effective in vaccination uptake and could be adapted in promoting COVID-19 mitigation behaviors, such as how one's actions can contribute to protecting their grandparents [30] .

Motivating this group (especially those less likely to be at risk or suffer the health impact of to adopt behaviors that require marked change in their routines, beyond those related to personal hygiene. It may prove difficult unless people understand the required behavior, the rationale for it, are given clear and sufficient information about how to comply, and they believe the strategy will have an impact and are motivated to act [7, 17, 34] . They also need to have capacity and opportunity to comply with new behaviors for another 4 to 6 months. In order to engage a community, they need to feel like they are a valued part of a team, and that their contributions are valued and key to the response.
