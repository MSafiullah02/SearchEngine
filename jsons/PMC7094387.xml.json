However, the development of mucosal vaccines has proven to be a challenge and only a limited number of mucosal vaccines are licensed in humans [3]. It is widely established that induction of memory responses is the fundamental basis of vaccination and the development of mucosal vaccines against intracellular pathogens that rely on protective memory T cell responses requires greater understanding about molecular and cellular mechanisms in controlling vaccine-induced mucosal T cell responses.",

In comparison, naive T cells have the phenotype of CCR7+CD62LhighCD44low CD45RBhigh\n[5], [6]. TCM cells predominantly circulate within secondary lymphoid organs, whereas TEM cells mainly circulate into the peripheral tissues where some are permanently retained in the tissue and become tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells [7], [8]. Furthermore, TCM cells produce low levels of effector molecules such as IFN-\u03b3 and/or cytotoxic granules, but they have high proliferative capacity and are able to convert to TEM upon antigen restimulation. In contrast, TEM and TRM cells produce immediate effector molecules upon stimulation but have very poor proliferative potential [4], [9]. Compared to TCM cells that are preferentially localized in the systemic lymphoid organs, TEM and TRM cells located at mucosal sites confer immediate frontline immunity against mucosal pathogens [7], [8], [10]. Numerous factors such as the strength and duration of the T cell receptor (TCR) signal, the local inflammatory signals at the time of T cell priming, and other microenvironmental signals associated with the route and/or the immunization schedule all play a role in shaping memory T cell responses in terms of their quality, quantity and anatomic distributions [1], [4], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]. However, most of our understanding has been obtained by studying CD8 memory T cells. CD4 and CD8 memory T cells are different in many aspects; they have different patterns of peripheral migration [12], different proliferation potential and different longevities [13]. Therefore, additional studies are required to understand the regulation of CD4 T memory responses.",

Using a rAd-based tuberculosis vaccine, we demonstrated previously that intranasal (i.n.) immunization with rAd induces accumulation of CD4 and CD8 TRM cells in the respiratory tract for a prolonged period of time and confers protection against pulmonary Mtb challenge via both CD4- and CD8-dependent immune mechanisms [15], [20]. In contrast, intramuscular (i.m.) immunization with rAd results in a predominant CD8 TCM cell response in the systemic lymphoid organs, which only translates into a transient partial protection from secondary Mtb challenge in the lung [15], [20]. While these studies highlight the importance of mucosal immunity in mediating vaccine efficacy against mucosal pathogens, the immune mechanisms that control mucosal CD4 memory T cell responses upon i.n. immunization with rAd are still unclear.",

            "text": "Antigen presenting cells (APCs) play key roles in the induction and regulation of pulmonary immune responses. In particular, respiratory macrophages (M\u03a6s) are demonstrated to modulate respiratory immune responses via various modes of action [21], [22], [23]. For instance, respiratory M\u03a6 can modulate immune responses via suppressing migration of dendritic cells (DCs) into the secondary lymphoid organs [21], [22], [24] or by promoting induction of FoxP3 regulatory T cells [25], [26]. Alternatively, respiratory M\u03a6s are demonstrated to participate in respiratory immune responses through directly transporting pathogen/antigen into the draining lymph modes (DLNs) [27], [28]. Although respiratory M\u03a6s are known to play essential roles during respiratory viral infections [29], [30], [31], it is unclear whether respiratory M\u03a6s may modulate T cell memory responses upon rAd mucosal immunization. In this study, we specifically characterized OVA-specific CD4 T cell responses following i.n. immunization of rAd expressing OVA (AdOVA) and examined the role of respiratory M\u03a6s in controlling CD4 memory T cell responses by depleting respiratory M\u03a6s using clodronate-containing liposome. Our results indicate that respiratory M\u03a6 populations have stage-dependent functional roles in shaping CD4 T memory responses. While respiratory M\u03a6s limit the early stage of CD4 T cell activation and subsequent size of mucosal memory responses, they are critically required for maintaining long-term CD4 T memory responses at both mucosal and systemic compartments.",

The antigen-specific CD4 memory T cell recall responses at 4 weeks post-immunization were examined by stimulating single cell suspensions derived from BAL, lung, or spleen with OVA323-339 peptides. Notably, AdOVA i.n. immunization induced a mixed Th1 and Th17 immune recall profile in the BAL- and lung-derived cell cultures, but a very low level in the splenocyte cultures. In contrast, i.m. immunization induced a Th1-dominant immune response that was predominantly distributed in the spleen, but very low in the respiratory tract (Fig. 1\na). Furthermore, OVA323-339-specific CD4 T cells activated by i.n. but not i.m. immunization also produced high levels of proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 (Fig. 1a). Corresponding to the cytokine profile in the BAL, approximately 25% of BAL cells from i.n. immunized mice were OVA-specific DO11.10 cells. In comparison, only \u223c1.5% of total BAL cells from i.m. immunized mice were OVA-specific DO11.10 cells and the total number of DO11.10 cells in the BAL of i.m. immunized mice was significantly reduced compared to i.n. immunized mice (Fig. 1b). Of interest, the frequencies of DO11.10 cells in the spleen of i.n. and i.m. immunized mice were comparable despite a significantly different cytokine profile in splenocyte cultures (Fig. 1a/c). These results are consistent with our previous studies using rAd vaccines encoding bacterial antigens [14], [15], indicating a common phenomenon for rAd-based vaccination that different routes of immunization with rAd stimulate CD4 memory T cell responses with different quantity, quality and differential anatomic distributions.",

The fate of T cells becoming stable memory T cells may be determined during the first division of T cell activation [35], [38]. In order to understand how different routes of immunization lead to different CD4 memory T cell responses, we examined CD4 T cell proliferation, an early event of T cell activation, in the lymphoid organs of i.n. and i.m. immunized mice. Based on the characteristic CFSE dilution profile, a clear DO11.10 CD4 T cell proliferation profile in the DLNs (in the MedLN of i.n. immunized mice and in IngLN of i.m. immunized mice) was evident at days 3 and 5 post immunization (Fig. 2\n). Notably, CD4 T cell proliferation kinetics induced by i.n. and i.m. immunization differed drastically at day 3 post immunization (see overlay). The frequencies of non-proliferating OVA-specific CD4 T cells in the IngLN and MedLN were \u223c10% and \u223c30%, respectively. Correspondingly, more DO11.10 CD4 T cells progressed to later cell cycles (cycle 4 and 5) in the IngLN of the i.m. group than that in the MedLN of i.n. immunized mice (Fig. 2a). However, the difference in proliferation kinetics appeared to be reduced by day 5 (Fig. 2b). As expected, no characteristic CD4 T cell proliferation was observed in the non-draining axillary LN or spleen in any immunization group at both time points. Instead, DO11.10 cells in the axillary LN and spleen exhibited distinct CFSE intensities that were indicative of either non-proliferating cells (the initial transferred DO11.10 T cells) or highly divided T cells (the disseminated DO11.10 cells from the DLNs) (Fig. 2a/b). Associated with the T cell proliferation kinetics in the DLNs, we observed a slow dissemination of activated CD4 T cells in the non-draining axillary LN and spleen of i.n. immunized mice compared to i.m. immunized mice. For instance, the frequencies of disseminated DO11.10 cells in the spleen of i.n. and i.m. immunized mice were 0.29% and 0.81%, respectively, at day 5 post immunization (Fig. 2a/b). Similarly, the frequencies of disseminated DO11.10 cells in the axillary LN were 0.32% (i.n.) versus 1.4% (i.m.) at day 5 post immunization (Fig. 2a/b). The frequencies of disseminated DO11.10 cells in the axillary LN and spleen of i.n. and i.m. immunized mice were comparable by day 7 post immunization (data not shown).",

            "text": "In order to examine whether the potential differences in antigen uptake during i.n. and i.m. immunization contribute to differential CD4 T cell proliferation kinetics, two doses of AdOVA were included in our comparison. While a dose-dependent KJ1-26+ T cell expansion was observed in the MedLN following i.n. immunization of AdOVA, the dose-dependent reaction was not observed in the IngLN of i.m. immunized mice (Fig. 3a/b), which may attribute to the concurrent events of CD4 T cell proliferation and active T cell emigration. In comparison, the number of KJ1-26+ T cells in the spleen displayed a clear trend of dose-dependent responses in both i.n. and i.m. immunized mice. Consistent with the proliferation profile, the overall levels of KJ1-26+ T cell expansion in the spleen of i.n. immunized mice were lower compared to i.m. immunized mice at both doses (Fig. 3\nc), suggesting that the model of antigen uptake in i.n. and i.m. immunization has a role in regulating CD4 T cell responses. Remarkably, the kinetics of OVA323-339-specific IFN-\u03b3 response in the splenocyte cultures was characteristically affected by the route of immunization (Fig. 3d). OVA peptide stimulated a rapid IFN-\u03b3 response, a typical TEM response, in i.m. immunized mice which was readily detected as early as 6 h and peaked at 12\u201324 h post stimulation. In contrast, the IFN-\u03b3 response in i.n. immunized mice was not detectable until 48 h post stimulation. Notably, an increased dose of AdOVA in both i.n. and i.m. immunization groups only affected the level, but not the kinetics, of IFN-\u03b3 recall responses (Fig. 3d), demonstrating that other factors, in addition to the model of antigen uptake, also play a role in controlling the CD4 T cell responses. Together, our results demonstrate that the impact of route of immunization on CD4 T cell responses starts at the very beginning of the immune induction phase via controlling CD4 T cell proliferation in the local DLNs. Not only does the distinct T cell proliferation kinetics result in different numbers of activated CD4 T cells, but also it affects the quality of activated CD4 T cells.",

To this end, mice were first immunized with AdOVA to prime APC populations in vivo. Lung APCs and MedLN APCs were purified from AdOVA i.n. immunized mice and IngLN APCs were isolated from AdOVA i.m. immunized mice using anti-CD11c-conjugated MACS beads. Purified CD11c+ cells were used to stimulate OVA-specific CD4 T cells ex vivo. Notably, a significantly reduced T cell proliferation was observed in the lung APC-containing cultures compared to those with APCs from MedLN and IngLN (Fig. 4\na/b). In parallel with a slower proliferation kinetics, more CD4 T cells activated by lung-derived APCs displayed higher levels of CCR7 compared to CD4 T cells activated by LN-derived APCs. In comparison, CD4 T cells in all culture conditions displayed comparable levels of CD44 (Fig. 4b). These results suggest that CD4 T cells activated by lung-derived APCs and LN-derived APCs may have an increased tendency to develop into CCR7+ TCM and CCR7- TEM CD4 T cells, respectively.",

Since respiratory M\u03a6 are reported to have immune suppressive activity under various conditions [40], [41], the difference between lung-derived APCs and LN-derived APCs (MedLN and IngLN) on CD4 T cell activation kinetics might be due to a decreased number of DCs in lung-derived APCs and the contaminated respiratory M\u03a6 may suppress CD4 T cell activation. Since Alveolar M\u03a6(AM), interstitial M\u03a6(IM) and respiratory DCs are distinguishable based on characteristic F4/80 and CD11c expression [24], we repeated co-cultured experiments by using pure CD11c+ DCs that were sorted from the lung and LNs of AdOVA-immunized mice by FACS. As demonstrated in Fig. 4c, sorted-CD11c+ DCs from lung and MedLN as well as IngLN stimulated CD4 T cell proliferation at comparable rates although lung DCs remained to be somewhat weaker compared to LN-derived DCs (Fig. 4c/e). CD11c+F4/80+ AMs and CD11c-F4/80+ IMs were also sorted from the lungs of AdOVA-immunized mice. Adding purified CD11c+F4/80+ AMs significantly reduced CD4 T cell proliferation in all co-cultures (Fig. 4d/e). CD11c-F4/80+ IMs also showed inhibitory effect on CD4 T cell proliferation in lung-DC cultures although they appeared to be less inhibitory (Fig. 4e). Notably, alveolar M\u03a6 isolated from na\u00efve mice had even stronger inhibitory effect (data not shown). Together, our data suggest that respiratory M\u03a6 are capable of limiting CD4 T cell activation and proliferation.",

To this end, we instilled CFSE to the airway to label the respiratory cells 6 h prior to AdOVA i.n. immunization and analyzed the frequency and phenotype of CFSE-positive M\u03a6 in the DLN and lung by flow cytometry at 40 h post immunization. As shown in Fig. 5\n, the vast majority of CFSE+ migrating cells in mice treated with CFSE/PBS were CD3+ and B220+, indicating a homeostatic migration of T cells and B cells from the airway to the DLN. Remarkably, AdOVA immunization significantly increased the frequency and total number of CFSE+ DCs (MHCII+CD11c+) and M\u03a6 (MHCII+CD11c+F4/80+) in the DLNs compared to the CFSE/PBS control group (Fig. 5a/b). Corresponding to the changes in the DLN, AdOVA immunization significantly increased the frequency and number of AMs and DCs in the lung (Fig. 5c/d). These results indicate that AdOVA i.n. immunization induces concurrent migration and/or expansion of respiratory DCs and M\u03a6 populations in the DLNs and lung parenchyma. Notably, AMs in Ad-immunized mice displayed an increased frequency of MHC II-positive (45% in CFSE/Ad group versus 28% in CFSE/PBS group). In addition, the F4/80+ cells observed in the lung of AdOVA-immunized mice were predominantly CFSE-negative and CD11c+ (Fig. 5b), indicating that accumulation of AMs in Ad-immunized mice is largely due to the recruitment of circulating monocyte-derived M\u03a6. Together, our results demonstrate a dynamic involvement of respiratory M\u03a6 populations upon i.n. vaccination with rAd.",

The T cell proliferation kinetics in the draining LNs (Fig. 7b) and OVA peptide-induced IFN-\u03b3 responses in splenocyte cultures (Fig. 7c) became indistinguishable among i.n. and i.m. immunized mice upon M\u03a6 depletion, highlighting a role of macrophages in suppressing CD4 T cell activation. We also examined the frequency of CD4+CD44highCD45RBlow memory T cells in the BAL and spleen of early depleted versus non-depleted mice at 4 weeks post immunization. As demonstrated in Fig. 7f/g, M\u03a6-depletion prior to immunization significantly increased the number of CD4 memory T cells in the BAL compared to the control liposome-treated mice. No apparent impact on memory T cells in the spleen was observed. In sharp contrast to the early depletion regimen, M\u03a6-depletion following AdOVA i.n. immunization resulted in a markedly reduced frequency and number of DO11.10 CD4 memory T cells in the BAL and spleen (\nFig. 7f/g), demonstrating a functional role of respiratory M\u03a6 for maintaining long-term CD4 memory T cell responses.",

By characterizing early events of CD4 T cell activation following i.n. and i.m. immunization, we have demonstrated that the differential CD4 T cell responses associated with the route of immunization are controlled by multiple factors including the model of antigen uptake and the intrinsic properties of APCs. By tracking respiratory macrophages upon i.n. immunization, we have revealed a dynamic process of respiratory macrophages induced by mucosal immunization and demonstrated that respiratory M\u03a6 and circulating monocytes migrate into the local draining LNs and accumulate in the lung parenchyma. By depleting macrophages using clodronate-containing liposomes, we have further demonstrated divergent roles for respiratory M\u03a6 populations in controlling CD4 T memory responses to rAd immunization in a stage-dependent manner. While respiratory M\u03a6 populations act as a negative regulator to limit the early stage of CD4 T cell activation and proliferation and the quality of T cells, they are critically required for maintaining long-term memory T cells, both the tissue-resident and systemic memory CD4 T cells.",

However, pulmonary M\u03a6 function poorly as professional APCs but possess immune suppressive activities to dampen the induction of adaptive immune response [21], [23], [25], [26], [40], [43]. Under resting conditions, M\u03a6-mediated immune suppression is essential in maintaining respiratory homeostasis and for preventing the induction of aberrant immune responses against inert antigens and environmental particles [43]. Upon respiratory infections, production of pro-inflammatory mediators is required for orchestrating innate immune cells such as DCs to counteract the inhibitory effect of pulmonary M\u03a6s. It has been demonstrated that M\u03a6-mediated immune suppression accounts for poor T cell responses and severe disease in mice during respiratory coronavirus infection [31]. Depletion of M\u03a6 in vivo with liposome delivery results in a significant increase in pulmonary CD4 and CD8 T cell responses against influenza and coronavirus infections [30], [31]. Consistent with these reports, we have also observed immune suppressive activity of pulmonary M\u03a6 in controlling the induction of CD4 T cell response and subsequent CD4 memory response during rAd i.n. immunization. Respiratory M\u03a6 may simply suppress induction of T cell responses via producing soluble molecules like prostaglandins, TGF-\u03b2 and IL-10 [41], [45].",

            "text": "In sharp contrast to a negative role of M\u03a6 over CD4 T cell responses upon i.n. immunization with rAd, M\u03a6-depletion after immunization markedly reduced the frequencies of CD4 memory T cells in the BAL and spleen (Fig. 7f/g). Therefore, our study has extended our understanding for a role of respiratory M\u03a6 populations in maintaining long-term memory CD4 T cells. At the moment, the molecular mechanisms underlying the observation remain unclear. Recent fate-mapping studies indicate that the tissue-resident M\u03a6 population is derived from the yolk sac and fetal liver during development [46], [47], and mixed with monocyte-derived M\u03a6s recruited from the bone marrow after tissue injury and infection [48]. While the yolk-sac-derived M\u03a6 population is capable of self-renewing in the steady state, its role in lung infection/immunization remains unclear. In our system, massive expansion of pulmonary M\u03a6 population after rAd immunization was observed (Fig. 5c/d). Although the vast majority of pulmonary M\u03a6 population appeared to be recruited from circulating monocytes, we cannot rule of the possibility that a portion of them are proliferating yolk-sac-derived M\u03a6 population. In addition, there might be an enhanced secondary monocyte recruitment in the lung following repeated clodronate-containing liposome delivery (Sup. Fig. 1). These monocytes are likely mobilized from the spleen as a result of heightened inflammatory responses in the lung [49]. However, investigating the precise role of these monocytes, monocyte-derived macrophages and different pulmonary M\u03a6 populations in maintaining long-term CD4 memory T cells requires a more sophisticated system. Nevertheless, it has been suggested in a recent study that immune regulatory macrophages differentiated from monocytes by M-CSF and IL-34 are able to switch non-committed human CD4 memory T cells into Th17 cells [50]. Conversely, the pro-inflammatory macrophages induced by GM-CSF promote Th1 cells [50]. Furthermore, a recent study using intra-vaginal immunization with an attenuated herpes simplex virus 2 demonstrates that tissue resident CD4 memory T cells are maintained by chemokines, particularly CCL5, secreted by local macrophages [51]. Therefore, the accumulation of respiratory TEM CD4 T cells in i.n immunized mice is unlikely only controlled at the initial phase of CD4 T cell activation in the DLNs. Rather, we believe that the initial TEM CD4 T cells disseminated from the DLNs may have undergone additional expansion, modification and fitness within the respiratory microenvironment and this process is largely dependent on the presence of respiratory M\u03a6 populations and the soluble mediators released by M\u03a6.",
