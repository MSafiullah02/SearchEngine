Consistent with the reported literature [2] , we also found that GVHD was associated with more RVIs (GVHD patients receive additional immunosuppression including corticosteroids), and myeloablative conditioning was associated with fewer RVIs (these patients are generally healthier, ie, able to tolerate myeloablative conditioning). Interestingly, our model did not find a significant difference between allo-HSCT and auto-HSCT; however, our model controls for inpatient/outpatient stay, taking into account the length of the interval. Because incidence of RVI after allo-HSCT is 3 times that of auto-HSCT, and the length of stay for allo-HSCT is 3 times that of auto-HSCT, controlling for length of stay minimizes the impact of type of transplant.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 217, "end": 220, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "A limitation of this study is the before-and-after design. There were significant differences between cohorts, such as the increased prevalence of plasma cell dyscrasia, and consequently auto-HSCT, in the mask cohort. However, universal surgical mask usage had a significant protective effect within both the auto-HSCT and allo-HSCT subgroups. Whereas seasonal and yearly variations in RVIs may also bias results, we found no parallel decrease in the rest of the hospital. Thus, it seems unlikely that natural variation in the rate of RVIs in the community accounts for the observed decrease. This is supported by our time-series analysis, which found a 60% decrease in the risk of RVIs in the mask period after accounting for the covariates of season and year, in addition to disease, type of transplant, and other variables. Additionally, differences in detection methods in the premask period (predominantly viral culture and DFA) vs the postmask period (PCR) could impact the results. However, as PCR is known to be at least 30% more sensitive at detecting viral pathogens compared with DFA and culture, depending on the pathogen, without sacrificing specificity [29, 30] , we would expect a bias toward the null. The true effect size of the mask intervention thus may be underrepresented in the current study.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1167, "end": 1171, "text": "[29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1172, "end": 1175, "text": "30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Our interventional study was designed in direct response to a rise in RVI in 2009, which could render it susceptible to effects seen due to regression to the mean. To mitigate this possibility, we collected data over an extended period of 4 full years following implementation of universal mask usage, rather than examining simply 1 season or 1 year. We considered the possibility of testing bias resulting in reduced vigilance in screening for RVIs during the mask period. However, the lower proportion of positive test results in the mask period suggests that testing is more frequent in the mask period-that is, undertesting would not explain the decrease in RVIs. We also considered the possibility that, over the course of the study period, improved hospital-wide infection control efforts over the 10year span of the study were responsible for the reduction in RVI rates in HSCT patients. However, a concurrent reduction in RVIs was not observed in either an adjacent non-HSCT hematologic malignancy unit or hospital-wide. Moreover, increasing use of more sensitive and specific PCR-based viral diagnostic testing would be expected to increase the detection of RVI during the universal mask period, as was seen in the adjacent hematologic malignancy unit. In contrast, we observed a decrease in RVIs despite this increased sensitivity, raising the possibility that we are underestimating the protective effect of universal mask usage.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In conclusion, we have shown that universal surgical mask usage, which requires all individuals in inpatient and outpatient HSCT facilities with direct patient contact to wear surgical masks regardless of symptoms or season, is associated with a significant decrease in clinically significant RVI, particularly PIV3.
