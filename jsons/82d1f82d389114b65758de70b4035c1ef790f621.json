Leiss emphasizes the importance of \"systemic risk,\" and he refers to a conference in 2006. Professor Haimes responds that he presented a paper at that meeting, and he hopes that Leiss will prepare a paper to present his ideas.",

Siegrist notes that while the review was thought-provoking and important for identifying research gaps, it may not have sufficiently clarified the distinction between trust and confidence measures. Earle responds that the issues pointed out by Siegrist are manageable with greater use of the consensus model in risk management settings. It is our intention that review articles such as Earle's will provoke interesting debates among our readers, and we welcome others to submit comments.",

Toru Watanabe, Timothy Bartrand, Mark Weir, Tatsuo Omura, and Charles Haas developed a dose-response model using mice-based and human epidemiological data. An exponential model provided the most effective fit to the data and led the authors to estimate a dose of SARS-CoV between 16 and 160 plagueforming units (PFU)/person for an apartment building in Hong Kong, depending on the floor. The authors note that this dose-response model helps us understand what would happen if SARS reemerged.",

They found that their model form (Gumbel copula) was predictive of outcomes and recommend it as a way of more rapidly evaluating economic losses.",

Lianfa Li, Jinfeng Wang, Hareton Leung, and Chengsheng Jiang built a Bayesian network (BN) that integrates multiple factors and quantification of uncertainties within their assessment system. The authors also used data mining and spatial data analysis to enhance the tool. They report that the model predicted more accurately than other options.",

Stephen Brown tested the first part of this expectation with a telephone survey of 255 Australians. Drivers were asked questions about speeding perceptions and behavior, and then follow-ups were asked 6 and 14 weeks later. During weeks 2 through 5, an antispeeding mass media campaign was conducted. After controlling for baseline perceptions, the authors reported a lower frequency of self-reported speeding among those with stronger anti-speeding perceptions. Notably, decreases in risk perception about speeding did not lead to changes in self-reported speeding.",

Unraveling these associations is important to understanding public perceptions and behaviors, and likely responses to public policy.",
