Since the 1960s, only two human pathogen members of this family have been identified: the Human coronavirus, strain 229E (HCoV 229E) and the Human coronavirus, strain OC43 (HCoV OC43). Known to be responsible for a large proportion of common colds (Hamre and Procknow, 1966, Holmes, 2001, Larson et al., 1980), they have been implicated in more serious diseases, along with the newly identified HCoV: the NL63 strain (Van der Hoek et al., 2004) and the HKU1 strain (Woo et al., 2005). Indeed, these viruses have been recognized as causing lower respiratory tract infections, (Vabret et al., 2003, Van Elden et al., 2004). They have also been involved in nosocomial viral infections, especially in young children and neonates (Gagneur et al., 2002a, Gagneur et al., 2002b, Moes et al., 2005, Vabret et al., 2008), in the elderly (Falsey et al., 2002, Nicholson et al., 1997) and in immunocompromised patients (Pene et al., 2003).",

Indeed, a HCoV 229E survival of 70% after 72 h at 20 \u00b0C and 50% relative humidity has been observed, as well as a HCoV 229E survival of 90% at 6 \u00b0C and a relative humidity \u226550%, which could account for airborne transmission and for winter epidemics of HCoV 229E, respectively (Ijaz et al., 1985). Another study showed 30% and 50% of virus residual infectivity for the HCoV 229E and the HCoV OC43, respectively, after 6 days in suspension in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at 37 \u00b0C and 30% of residual HCoV 229E infectivity after 3 h of drying on different supports found in hospital settings, i.e. aluminium, sterile sponges or latex surgical gloves (Sizun et al., 2000). More recently, numerous studies have underlined an important SARS-CoV survival under various conditions: in serum, in 1:20 diluted sputum, in faeces for at least 96 h and in urine for at least 72 h. SARS-CoV also retained infectivity at 4 \u00b0C, at room temperature and at 37 \u00b0C for at least 2 h (Duan et al., 2003, Rabenau et al., 2005). Furthermore, some studies have shown the transfer of viruses from contaminated hosts (hands, nasal mucosa) to surfaces and from environmental surfaces to hands and therefore a potential contamination of susceptible hosts (Sattar et al., 1993, Winther et al., 2007). Another study has also shown a longer survival of a herpesvirus on human skin than on an inanimate carrier (i.e. a stainless steel disk) (Graham et al., 1996). Thus, considering the potential resistance of HCoV for some hours in the environment, their pathogenesis and the absence of specific treatment, an efficient skin antisepsis, to stop eventual dissemination by the hands of healthcare workers, is a meaningful way to fight virus transmission and associated diseases.",

Indeed, the neutralization step is fundamental: (i) to ensure a precise contact time and (ii) to remove any potential cytotoxicity before inoculation to the cells, which could involve confusion in product activity estimation. In the European Standard NF EN 14476+A1, two global techniques are proposed: dilution in iced medium and gel filtration techniques, but they involve different problems such as lengthening of contact times, efficiency and also cost. In the dilution method, the neutralization step requires 30 min, inconsistent with recommended contact times for the different applications mentioned in the European Standard. Also, not all contact times are suited to the potential use of the product, e.g. 60 min is the mandatory contact time for testing disinfectants for surfaces and instruments and facultative times are 5 min, 15 min and 30 min, but in practice, a surface would rarely be disinfected during 60 min. Furthermore, dilution has not always been shown to be efficient. For instance, the IC50 and CC50 of CHX on L-132 cells are higher than 2 \u00d7 10\u22126\n mol L\u22121 at 24 h, 48 h and 168 h. So even after a 1:100 dilution of a 10\u22123\n mol L\u22121 solution of CHX (the European Standard recommends a 1:10 dilution or 1:100 if not efficient), the solution remains cytotoxic.",

The major problem of these methods is the lengthening of contact time. Indeed, they need at least 2 min to achieve the neutralization step, sometimes 10 min or more, depending on the techniques. Furthermore, separation capacities are not well adapted to the molecular mass of most ATS-D. Another drawback of Minicon\u00ae concentrators is that they are non-sterile devices and do not bear sterilization, so they cannot be used to filter viruses.",

The virucidal efficacy criterion for the ASTM standard is a log10 reduction >3. The ASTM procedure is close to the one developed here.

The other gel proposed, Sephacryl\u2122 superfine S-1000, is commercialized in a suspension form in distilled water containing 20% ethanol as conservative. The presence of ethanol could affect the tests, emphasizing the effect of the ATS-D tested so leading to an overestimation of the product activity.

The European Standard NF EN 14476+A1 proposed 3 viruses: a poliovirus (type 1, LSc-2ab), an adenovirus (type 5) and a bovine parvovirus (Haden strain). Poliovirus was chosen for its potential high resistance to chemicals but taking into account the worldwide program of poliomyelitis eradication, the legitimacy of this choice is questionable. In the same way, the choice of B19 parvovirus and adenovirus is arguable. Although B19 parvovirus is responsible for serious but rare materno-foetal infections and also infections in immunocompromised patients and/or patients with a haemolytic anaemic disorder, it has not been shown to be a frequent nosocomial pathogen. Its interest, however, lies in its high resistance to chemicals and to a wide range of pH and temperatures and its potential blood transmission route (Morinet et al., 2003). However, the strain used in the European Standard is a bovine parvovirus, so there is a question of representativeness. In contrast, Human serovar 5 adenovirus is more interesting notably for its responsibility in mild upper respiratory tract infections, ophthalmologic infections and also gastro-enteritis, particularly in new-borns and young children. It can cause rare but serious (mortality up to 50%) infections in immunodepressed patients, especially in bone-marrow transplanted patients (Carret and Le Faou, 2001). It has also probably been chosen for its high resistance in environmental conditions. All these viruses are naked viruses and not always representative of majors risks encountered in community or in hospital settings.",

These difficulties were experienced, mainly with Sephadex\u2122 G-10 that needed excess of solvent (i.e. PBS) when swelling to reach neutrality, and also with sterile distilled water, owing to the sterilization process, which often involved acidification. This could be due to a high sensitivity of the HCoV 229E to the pH. Rapid loss of infectivity and an aggregation of virions have been shown at pH 8 and 37 \u00b0C, whereas the virus was quite stable at pH 6 and 37 \u00b0C (Sturman et al., 1990).

In most studies, CHX has been shown: (i) to be inefficient against naked viruses (Bernstein et al., 1990, Kawana et al., 1997, Narang and Codd, 1983, Wood and Payne, 1998) and (ii) to be efficient at concentrations >10\u22123\n mol L\u22121 on enveloped viruses but its activity depends on viruses tested and testing conditions (Bernstein et al., 1990, Kawana et al., 1997, Platt and Bucknall, 1985, Tyler and Ayliffe, 1987, Wood and Payne, 1998). For instance, CHX reduced Herpes simplex virus viral titers of >3 log10 in suspension tests for under 3 min (Kawana et al., 1997, Wood and Payne, 1998) and only of 1 log10 on a dried sample of HSV in 10 min (Tyler and Ayliffe, 1987). It is also important to note that most antiseptics and other chemicals are used as a mix of different molecules and the diluent, often ethanol, has its own virucidal activity. For instance, different formulations containing chlorhexidine digluconate were assayed for ATS antiviral activity. It did not respond to the American virucidal criterion when tested at 0.008% (m/v), i.e. 8.9 \u00d7 10\u22125\n mol L\u22121 with cetrimide at 0.08% (m/v).

Such protocols can use support as plastic, steel disk (Sattar et al., 2003), fingertips (Sattar and Ansari, 2002) or disks of human skin removed during plastic surgery (Graham et al., 1996). Carrier tests are recommended in different Standards to simulate at best field situation, where viruses are dried and often embedded in organic material limiting the access to ATS-D and thus their potential activity. Ex vivo protocols are of importance to test antiviral ATS activity of either pathogenic viruses or toxic compounds that, for healthy and ethic reasons, could not be assayed with in vivo protocols, using for instance, fingertips of volunteers. Furthermore, they are also useful to evaluate pathogen survival on human skin. Carrier tests need a dilution step to recover the dried virus suspension from the support after action of a chemical. This dilution step plays the role of neutralizer and ensures the contact time. It could be achieved by addition of culture medium or any chemical, which could neutralize specifically product activity (e.g. use of sodium thiosulfate for neutralizing povidone-iodine). However, the diluent itself could be toxic for the cells. Thus, this method could be applied in such a case to eliminate the chemical neutralizer and inoculate the viral suspension safely. This potential is also found in the ASTM standard E 1482-04.",
