We would like to thank these authors for sharing their experience of transmission rates to anaesthetists associated with the provision of spinal anaesthesia in patients with COVID-19. These early data are welcome as health care professionals face the challenge of managing the pandemic. However, we suggest that these findings need to be interpreted with caution.",

The choice of appropriate PPE frequently hinges around whether the patient contact involves an aerosol-generating procedure (AGP), such as tracheal intubation or extubation. This can be particularly difficult in the obstetric population where the majority of operations are performed under neuraxial anaesthesia (not considered to be an AGP), but with the ever-present risk of requiring expedient conversion to general anaesthesia with tracheal intubation during surgery. The data presented by Zhong and colleagues suggest that use of level 1 PPE (surgical mask, hat, gown and gloves) for spinal anaesthesia was associated with an elevated risk of COVID-19 transmission to the anaesthetist performing spinal anaesthesia compared to level 3 PPE (N95 mask, hat, goggles, face-shield, gloves, protection suits and gowns).",

While the authors assert that the anaesthetists performing spinal anaesthesia did not have contact with other COVID patients, transmission of disease may not require direct contact with infected individuals as viral transmission can occur through fomite spread, for example from infected hard surfaces. Another relevant factor when assessing the effectiveness of PPE in any context is the issue of asymptomatic carriers. In a radical approach to the pandemic, Iceland has undertaken rigorous and comprehensive measures of source control. This has included testing a higher percentage of the population for COVID-19 than any other country. 2 The finding that approximately 50% of people infected with COVID-19 are asymptomatic has also been confirmed by other small population studies. 3 Indeed, in Zhong and colleagues' study three out of the five anaesthetists who tested positive did so in the absence of any symptoms. Therefore, the potential impact of We acknowledge that uncertainty remains regarding the efficacy and effectiveness of various forms of PPE for COVID-19. Further detailed studies are urgently needed to chart a path towards clarity in appropriate PPE requirements during this pandemic.",
