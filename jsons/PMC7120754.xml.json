Although \u201cbronchiolitis\u201d is actually a pathological description, bronchiolitis is used as a clinical diagnosis for a disease characterized by coryza, cough, fever, increased respiratory effort, hyperinflation of the chest, wheezing, widespread fine crackles on auscultation, and poor feeding. Around 2\u20133 % of all infants in resource-rich countries are admitted to the hospital with bronchiolitis. Annually, bronchiolitis is estimated to account for two million children under 5 years of age requiring medical attention and 60,000\u201390,000 hospitalizations in the USA alone [1]. Approximately 3\u201310 % of infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis develop respiratory failure and require admission to a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) [2, 3]. This chapter will concentrate on severe bronchiolitis that requires critical care, and especially respiratory, support.",

Even though outbreaks of pyrexial respiratory illnesses have been described for many centuries, probably the first description of an outbreak of RSV was reported in 1941 [4]. Adams described an outbreak of nosocomial chest infections in 32 infants in a neonatal unit that resulted in 9 deaths, with cytoplasmic inclusions identified in the lungs at autopsy. RSV was first identified in 1956 from a colony of chimpanzees with coryza and designated \u201cchimpanzee coryzal agent\u201d. Subsequently a year later in 1957 it was isolated from children with lung disease in Baltimore, USA [5]. Since then RSV has been recognized as the single most important virus causing acute respiratory tract infections in infants and young children throughout the world [1, 6, 7]. Although primarily a respiratory pathogen of infants and young children, RSV infects and re-infects adults, and causes significant disease in the elderly and in those patients with chronic lung disease or immunocompromise [6].",

Other family members include the Paramyxivirinae: parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, 3; mumps and the morbillivirus measles. In the same order Mononegavirales, the fellow RNA viruses influenza A and influenza B reside in the family Orthomyxoviridae (Greek orthos for \u201cstraight\u201d + myxa for \u201cmucus\u201d). RSV is a pleomorphic (spherical or filamentous form) enveloped RNA virus 120\u2013300 nm in size that contains a non-segmented single-strand negative-sense RNA genome. Two large surface glycoproteins, fusion protein (F) and attachment protein (G), are the major antigenic determinants and induce antibody production. There are two major groups of RSV strains, A and B, that are distinguished by antigenic characteristics, mainly in variations in the G (attachment) protein, as there are few differences in the F (fusion) protein between the strains [6, 8, 9].",

It is suggested that another structural capsular/envelope protein, the SH (small hydrophobic) protein, plays a role in both syncytial formation and blocking of cell death/apoptosis. RSV virion assembly occurs at the plasma membrane of infected cells and are released by budding, taking a lipid bilayer membrane derived from the infected host cell with them. Infectious RSV is probably in the filamentous form [10].",

The characteristic infective and inflammatory process of bronchiolitis leads to loss of cilial motility, submucosal edema, increased mucus secretion, infiltration by leukocytes, necrosis and sloughing of the respiratory epithelial cells of the small airways, all of which obstructs airflow through the small/distal airways [10]. During expiration this enhances dynamic small/distal airways narrowing, producing disproportionate turbulence and decreased airflow causing air-trapping. Further air-trapping can be caused by a ball-valve mechanism of airway obstruction due to intraluminal plugging by mucus and cellular debris. Clinically the inflammatory process in the small/distal airways (i.e. bronchiolitis) can result in both pulmonary hyperinflation and areas of atelectasis, along with wheezing due to small/distal airways obstruction.",

Inherent variations in the infected individual\u2019s inflammatory and apoptotic response also influence the degree of submucosal edema, increased mucus secretion, and sloughing of epithelial cells. The former factors probably account for the high incidence of respiratory disease in younger smaller individuals with their smaller distal airways (e.g. premature infants) [3, 10].

Therefore the immunopathogenesis of RSV disease in the great majority of children who develop mild respiratory symptoms, and may not see a doctor or attend hospital, is largely inferred [8, 11, 12]. A misdirected immune cascade, characterised by an overexuberant release of inflammatory mediators (\u201ccytokine storm\u201d) and infiltration of a range of monocytes and polymorphonuclear cells may predispose to more severe bronchiolitis, which is further manipulated by host genetic and acquired factors. Contrary to prevailing inflammatory avalanche theories, a study in Chilean children (where mechanical ventilation was not available) dying from RSV or influenza bronchiolitis and North American infants surviving RSV or influenza bronchiolitis found a blunted adaptive cell-mediated immune response with a relative absence of cytotoxic T-cells [10]. In the fatal cases, especially with RSV infection, there was excessive viral antigen and overwhelming apoptotic sloughing of infected respiratory epithelial cells [10].",

Vaccinated children lacked specific mucosal antibodies; their serum antibodies were deficient in fusion-inhibiting and neutralizing activity; some had increased lymphocytic and/or eosinophilic proliferation [6]. These findings suggested that protection against RSV infection necessitates a balance between humoral and cellular immunity. However, the relative contributions of the humoral and cellular immune components in RSV infection and immunity to subsequent RSV infection is still debated [6, 8, 10]. Effective and appropriately-restrained protection from RSV bronchiolitis most probably requires a viral neutralizing response (humoral/antibody + cellular) without an excessive RSV-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte response [8, 11].",

In the northern hemisphere the annual \u2018RSV season\u2019 is usually between November and March, with the typical peak period being December through to February. During their first RSV infection, between 25 % and 40 % of infants have bronchiolitic (or pneumonic) signs and symptoms, and up to 3 % require hospitalization (in developed/resource-rich nations) [1, 15]. In the USA, RSV bronchiolitis accounts for up to 90,000 hospitalizations annually, 20,000 in the UK, and 3,000 in the Netherlands [1, 15]. Generally the reported hospital admission rates for children under 1 year of age in the USA and Europe is around 25\u201330 per 1,000 infants [3]. Incidence and hospitalization rates for bronchiolitis in resource-limited areas are lacking owing to the paucity of epidemiological studies and cost-saving restrictions in laboratory confirmation of viral infection [4, 7, 16]. Both A and B strains circulate concurrently within a RSV season. There are distinct genotypes within the strains which vary in dominance within a community from year to year [17]. This may account for the frequency of re-infection as any immunity to previous genotypes is evaded [17]. Approximately 3\u201310 % of infants hospitalized with RSV infection (and about 1 % of all those with bronchiolitis) develop respiratory failure and require admission to PICU [2, 3]. Amongst the children from resource-rich countries admitted to PICU with bronchiolitis, the reported incidence of those requiring mechanical or non-invasive ventilation varies from 50 % to 100 % depending more on the country, than the region or unit [2, 18, 19].",

RT-PCR is reported to offer greater sensitivity and multiplex PCR kits that detect several viruses simultaneously are readily available [13]. Most commonly nasopharyngeal aspirates are tested, but in intubated patients an endotracheal aspirate or broncho-alveolar lavage can be utilized.

However, bronchiolitis is a heterogeneous disease with some patients having a significant degree of lung consolidation and more restrictive, than obstructive, lung disease [27]. Some authors have discriminated restrictive from obstructive RSV lung disease on pulmonary function tests (decrease respiratory compliance) [28] or ventilatory indices (oxygen index, alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient, mean airways pressure) [29], in addition to four-quadrant alveolar consolidation on chest radiograph in mechanically ventilated children. In everyday pediatric practice clinicians cannot strictly dichotomise this heterogeneous lung disease into restrictive and obstructive forms, especially when each potentially occurs within different parts of the same lung [16, 27]. In the USA and some European countries \u201cRSV bronchiolitis\u201d and \u201cRSV pneumonia\u201d are differentiated clinically by the presence of localized crackles and consolidation on chest radiograph [3]. Informed clinicians generally appreciate the pneumonic aspects of severe bronchiolitis whether labelled \u201cRSV bronchiolitis\u201d, \u201cRSV pneumonia\u201d or \u201cRSV pneumonitis\u201d.",

Dual respiratory infections (RSV in addition to other respiratory viruses or concomitant bacteria) have also been shown to increase disease severity as indicated by the need for PICU admission and mechanical ventilation [1, 19, 35, 36].

The viral load and/or uncontrolled viral replication may well influence disease severity. Higher viral loads in tracheal aspirates of ventilated infants with \u201csevere RSV LRTI\u201d compared to \u201cmild disease\u201d (differentiated on mean airways pressure and oxygenation indices) have been found [37]. A higher nasal viral load in ventilated compared to non-ventilated bronchiolitic children was demonstrated in an initial study, however, a subsequent larger study (from the same research team) failed to find a significant difference [38]. Viral load and/or uncontrolled viral replication being a factor is supported by the finding of excessive viral antigen and overwhelming apoptotic sloughing of infected respiratory epithelial cells in the fatal cases of Chilean children dying from RSV (especially) or influenza bronchiolitis [10]. However, viral strain and viral load alone cannot fully account for variations in disease severity, so it remains likely that variations in pre-existing structural elements of the distal respiratory tree and the inherent immune response also play key roles [10, 14].",

RSV-RNA has been detected by RT-PCR in whole blood, but not plasma of infants and neonates, but this alone merely indicates cell-associated RSV genome. RSV-RNA is not necessarily viable RSV and is more likely to be virus phagocytosed by neutrophils or monocytes.

However, strong convincing evidence of RSV-related inflammation or infection at these sites is less forthcoming. Elevated cardiac troponin levels in infants with severe RSV infection are well described. Unfortunately this is not necessarily indicative of RSV-directed myocardial injury, but more likely the result of (right) heart strain secondary to severe lung parenchymal disease [40, 41]. Likewise, it is highly suggestive that raised hepatic transaminases in this patient group are consequential to hepatic congestion or ischemia due to right heart failure, itself secondary to parenchymal lung disease and/or pulmonary hypertension [41, 42]. Proof of a RSV hepatitis would take histological verification (i.e. liver biopsy), which for ethical reasons is only ever going to occur postmortem. Apneas and seizures undoubtedly occur in RSV infection, but presently there is more support for RSV encephalopathy than RSV encephalitis [39]. The reported frequency of bronchiolitis-induced apnea varies from 1 % to 24 % of those children admitted to hospital, and up to 20 % of those admitted to PICU [43, 44]. Unfortunately many of the reports fail to adequately adjust for the confounding consequence that hypoxic episodes and hypercapnea may have on the patient\u2019s neurological status. When not related to hypoxic or electrolyte imbalance triggers, RSV\u2019s central influence/effect is probably related to released neurotoxic inflammatory chemokines and cytokines [12, 13]. Endocrine impact/consequences appear to be the sequelae of severe RSV pulmonary disease and/or its treatment. It is likely that occurrences of hyponatremia and hyponatremic seizures are largely related to the use of hypotonic/electrolyte-poor intravenous solutions [39]. Further research is required to scrutinize whether the reported neuroendocrine stress response in RSV bronchiolitis is no more than an epiphenomenon reflecting severity of RSV disease. Extrapulmonary effects are not uncommon and are more likely to be the end result of release of inflammatory mediators than direct effects.",

            "text": "If despite oxygen supplementation children develop respiratory failure artificial respiratory support (non-invasive or mechanical ventilation) may become necessary. The application of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) keeps the airways open and thereby facilitates expiratory flow, improves compliance, reduces work of breathing and enhances gas exchange. There is supportive evidence that delivery of CPAP via a mask or nasal prongs may reverse impending respiratory failure and avoid intubation [68\u201370]. On this front, humidified high-flow nasal oxygen is demonstrating great promise in providing effective respiratory support \u2013 preventing progression of respiratory failure to needing mechanical ventilation and shortening admissions [71]. Intubation and mechanical ventilation (positive pressure ventilatory support) is the mainstay of supportive therapy for children with viral bronchiolitis-induced respiratory failure due to worsening lung compliance, imminent respiratory collapse secondary to exhaustion, or apnoea and respiratory arrest. Already in the 1980s, retrospective studies confirmed the effectiveness of mechanical ventilation in bronchiolitis-associated respiratory failure [72]. Unfortunately there are no randomized controlled trials on the level of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) or ventilatory strategies (for example, volume-controlled versus pressure controlled, or high frequency versus conventional ventilation) for ventilated children with bronchiolitis-induced respiratory failure [18]. Perhaps this is because bronchiolitis is a heterogeneous lung disease with varying obstructive and restrictive elements, rather than a homogenous clinical entity [18, 27]. When maximum conventional mechanical ventilation or high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) fail to stabilize or reverse deteriorating oxygenation (and ventilation), extracorporeal life support (ECLS)/extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is the last port of call for these refractory cases. Survival rates of ECLS/ECMO for RSV bronchiolitis are better than other indications for ECLS/ECMO and range from 71 % [73] to as high as 96 % [74], with a low reported rate of neurological sequelae [75].",

The use of hyperimmune RSV (polyclonal) immunoglobulin has fallen out of favour due to its intravenous route, the intravenous volume required, an increased risk of adverse outcomes in infants with cyanotic heart disease, and possible inactivation of live vaccines (for example measles-mumps-rubella) [78].

Palivizumab has been shown to reduce RSV-related hospital admission by 55 % in preterm infants born at less than 32 weeks gestation [76] and by 45 % in infants born with significant congenital heart disease [79]. Despite this reduction in hospital admission for serious RSV disease, the cost-benefit balance for infants born at more than 32 weeks gestation or with congenital heart disease is still debated intensely [24, 77]. Although the RSV-IMpact trial examining the efficacy of palivizumab in preterm infants demonstrated an overall reduction in hospitalization of 55 % compared to controls, it did not impact on the number requiring PICU admission (1.3 % vs. 3 %) or the number requiring mechanical ventilation (0.2 % vs. 0.7 %) [76]. Similarly, despite an overall reduction in hospitalization of 45 % compared to controls in the trial examining the efficacy of palivizumab in children with congenital heart disease, the number requiring PICU admission (2 % vs. 3.7 %) or the number requiring mechanical ventilation (1.3 % vs. 2.2 %) was not significantly different [79]. Post palivizumab licensure studies comparing the number of children requiring PICU admission and mechanical ventilation in the RSV seasons prior to palivizumab to those in the RSV seasons following its prophylactic use have found no significant reductions following the introduction of palivizumab [80]. Currently a second generation recombinant humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody, motavizumab, with enhanced anti-RSV neutralizing activity is being tested.",

Even though it produced high serum antibody levels it resulted in worse bronchiolitis following RSV infection in the vaccinated group than the control non-vaccinated children [3, 6, 15]. Development of an effective RSV vaccine is being actively explored and is a high research priority [3, 6]. A RSV vaccine needs to offer better protection than that from natural infection and be effective in the first weeks of life when maternally-acquired anti-RSV antibodies are still present. Live attenuated vaccines have the potential advantages of being delivered intranasally and inducing both a local mucosal and a systemic immune response. However, they tend to be unstable, too virulent and revert back to wild-type virus [3, 6, 15]. Vaccines produced from purified viruses, recombinant vectors, and plasmids containing complementary DNA of the viral genome that generally target the F (fusion) and G (attachment) transmembrane glycoproteins are being trialled [3, 6, 32].",
