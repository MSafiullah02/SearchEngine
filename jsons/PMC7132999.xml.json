            "text": "Seasonal influenza may not make headlines, but together with pneumonia, it is one of the top ten causes of death worldwide. Influenza epidemics results in 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness a year, which puts a high burden on health providers and results in loss of productivity and absenteeism, such as mentioned by the World Health Organization in [1]. It\u2018s been long known that in temperate climates these seasonal epidemics occur mostly in winter, and typical hypotheses assigned the blame to people being in closer proximity for longer periods of time, or lowered immune systems. In general, meteorological conditions affect virus transmission due to multiple effects: virus survival rates, host contact rates and immunity, and the transmission environment (except the case of direct or short-range contact). While these factors may have an influence, the solid evidence sustains the hypothesis that the virus\u2018s best surviving conditions are low temperatures and low absolute humidity. One of the goals of the current research in this field is to understand this relationship to be able to develop a more accurate seasonal influenza model for both temperate and tropical regions. As a motivation of this work, JT et al. [2] conclude that environment factors may become more important for a future predictive model of the effects of climate change. In a previous paper [3], some of the authors of this paper studied the interaction of the spatio-temporal distribution of influenza in Spain and the meteorological conditions during five consecutive influenza seasons. The work uses real influenza and meteorological data in combination with statistical models to show that there is a relationship between the transmission of influenza and meteorological variables like absolute humidity and amount of rainfall. In this work we use the same data sources (SISSS and AEMET agencies) following a different approach: we study some of these relationships from a simulation perspective, considering not only the existing influenza distributions but also the ones related to the climate change.",

The goal of this work is to identify the turning point (peak of the infected population) of the infection. Although the initial approaches for modelling the infection spreading across the contact network, our work consider a broader number of parameters and configuration of the network. HE et al. [21] analyze, by means of simulation, the relationship between social interaction patterns at workplaces and the virus transmission patterns during influenza pandemics. The main effort is geared towards the flexible specification of the different aspects involved in a simulation, such as intervention policies, social modelling, social organization of work, etc. SimFlu [22] is different from most epidemic simulators in that it focuses on the discovery of most probable future influenza variants starting from virus sequences published by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). This work is complementary to the goal of most simulators, including ours, which is to understand and predict the spreading infection patterns of a known flu strand across a population. Their methodology is based on observing directional changes in subtypes of influenza over time.",

The pre-processing stage is performed to obtain clean inputs for the meteorological model. First, the weather station nearest to each simulated urban region is identified. Our simulations consider 92 different urban regions with more than 100,000 inhabitants. In some cases, the station is within the city limits, while in others it is located in a nearby area (for instance at the region\u2018s airport). The data from each weather station is analyzed to reconstruct potentially missing samples. Sometimes it is the case that some station data samples are missing because the station was not operational during a given time period. These represents just a small fraction of the overall samples, but they have to be properly addressed. Figure 2 shows an example of how the original missing data (shown in upper figure) is reconstructed producing a complete samplingclearpage (reconstructed values are shown in the lower figure in red color). In order to add the missing samples, we have used the reconstruct data algorithm (missdata) included in the Matlab\u2019s System Identification Toolbox.

Using regression, they conclude that there exists a strong correlation between absolute humidity and mortality, even when controlling for temperature, when the humidity drops below daily means of 6g/kg. Temperature correlations also exist, mainly in the daily ranges between -1.1C and 15.6C. In an earlier paper ([7]) JS et al. study the same dataset and simulate influenza transmission via a SIRS model modulated by the data to obtain the basic reproduction number R0.

The information collected by the SISSS includes data on demographics, clinical and virological characteristics, seasonal vaccination status, chronic conditions, and pregnancy. Data is entered weekly by each regional sentinel network in a web-based application [36] and analyzed by the National Centre of Epidemiology to provide timely information on the evolving influenza activity in Spanish regions and at the national level.

This occurs at the inflection point in the propagation graph, specifically at about 16 weeks (in our data). The vaccination success rate during the 2010-2011 season was approximately 50% [39].

The case can be made that meteorological changes were not as extreme before 2002, and that a regression model based on new data may change as well over time. While this is a definite possibility, we believe that its nature will not change in a fundamental way, such that we can still predict trends, if not absolute values.",

The simulator results are compared to real data on infection rates and across the whole country. The results for the prediction of the evolution of the influenza propagation for each community over time are similar in shape to the real data. After validating the simulator, we evaluate different scenarios that reflect changes in climate conditions, and show the predictions for variations in the relative humidity and temperature.
