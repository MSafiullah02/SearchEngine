The discussion continues as to whether or not severe early virus infections play a part in the development of asthma by immune modulation and/or airway damage, or whether children who present with virus-induced wheezing have a pre-existing predisposition. The subject has become more complicated since it has been recognised that early infections may protect against asthma, the so-called \u2018hygiene hypothesis\u2019.3., 4.\n",

Infants are born with a tendency to respond to infection by producing cytokines with a TH-2 profile (IL-4, IL-10), so have an impaired TH-1 response.3., 8. Since the immune response to infections also involves CD8+ lymphocytes, it is probably more appropriate to label the responses as types 1 and 2.3 With increasing maturity, the immune response switches from a predominantly type 2 to a predominantly type 1 response by the effect of repeated infections on antigen-presenting cells which produce IL-12. In the absence of infections or with an atopic predisposition, this switch from a type 2 to a predominantly type 1 response is impaired (Fig. 1\n).",

Why only a minority develop airways obstruction (wheeze) is still a matter of debate. Some viruses, for example RSV and the influenza viruses, actually infect the lower airways, so have the potential to cause airway obstruction by an acute inflammatory process. Rhinovirus RNA has been found in bronchoalveolar lavage and biopsy samples of inoculated volunteers but the significance for this is still not clear.9 A number of mechanisms have been identified that could contribute to airway obstruction and the increased bronchial responsiveness seen in association with an acute viral infection in asthma and, to a lesser extent, in normal subjects (Table 1\nand Fig. 2\n). These have recently been reviewed.3., 9., 10., 11. Much of the data have been obtained with experimental viral infections in adults who had mild asthma but not necessarily with a history of virus-induced exacerbations, or who were normal. The extent of each process may vary according to the host\u2019s immune response, the presence or absence of any underlying airway inflammation and the particular virus infection involved. There is likely to be an interaction, additive or synergistic, between the acute viral inflammation and the asthma pathology. Of particular interest is the possibility that pre-existing airway inflammation could interfere with the host\u2019s antiviral defence by skewing the response towards type 2, so exaggerating damage to the airway.11\n",

This predisposing airway dysfunction (reduced airway calibre and/or altered mechanics) is also associated with maternal smoking during pregnancy.12 However, transient wheeze also occurs in those whose mothers have never smoked, suggesting additional pre-natal environmental or genetic influences. For example, polymorphisms of the beta-2 receptor gene have recently been shown to influence neonatal lung function15., 17. and bronchial responsiveness.15 The association of symptoms with virus infections in those with transient wheeze was not established in the original study but it is often assumed, due to the common observation that very young children with recurrent virus-induced wheeze grow out of their symptoms in the first few years. Also viruses can be detected in the majority of acute episodes in young as well as older children.7\n",

Typically, these young children respond poorly to bronchodilator or corticosteroid therapy until about 18 months of age, in keeping with a mechanical basis for their symptoms. Some continue to exhibit episodic viral wheeze without changing symptom pattern, and begin to respond unequivocally to bronchodilators. As we know that infants have functioning beta receptors and can be protected from induced bronchoconstriction from 1 month of age,18 it is possible that there are two independent airway defects, one related to reduced airway calibre (and possibly maternal smoking) and the other to altered tone, both of which could result in reduced lung function at birth. There is the possibility of a genetic basis for this dysfunction of airway tone as an increase in response to a bronchodilator was associated with a polymorphism of the beta-2 adrenoceptor at amino acid 16.19 The same genotype was related to reduced lung function and increased bronchial responsiveness at birth, which in turn were found in those with transient wheeze.15 It is likely that there is overlap between transient wheeze and the group of episodic wheezers described below, in which a disorder of airway tone is also suggested.",

In contrast to the atopic persistent wheezers characteristic of classical asthma, these children improved through later childhood. Also from the Tucson follow-up study, children with RSV infection in early life continued to be at increased risk of episodic wheezing up to the age of 13 years but the numbers diminished with age.20 These children showed reduced pre- but not post-bronchodilator lung function. Again, neither of these studies took into account the pattern of symptoms, but they could represent the same sort of school-age children with wheezing solely related to viral infections, whose symptoms did not respond to inhaled beclomethasone.21 Taken together, these studies suggest a group of children who wheeze in association with recurrent viral infection, independently of atopy, with an abnormality of airway tone. Further support for a genetic basis for this type of wheezing, solely related to infections, is provided by family studies of children with wheezy bronchitis.22 How exactly a virus infection induces reversible bronchoconstriction in this situation is not clear. It is unlikely to be mediated via a chronic eosinophilic airway inflammatory process because of the lack of response to inhaled corticosteroids21 and because no eosinophils were found in bronchoalveolar lavage in children with symptoms only associated with virus infections (Fig. 3\n).23\n",

When strict entry criteria were used to define RSV bronchiolitis, by excluding children >1 year at entry and those in whom the RSV infection was not confirmed at the first wheezy episode, a review of all eligible studies concluded that post-bronchiolitic wheezing was not associated with any increased risk of atopy nor with a family history of atopy,29 making immunomodulation by RSV infections unlikely. The one glaring exception is the study by Sigurs et al. in which RSV bronchiolitis was the strongest independent risk factor for asthma and atopic sensitisation in their multivariate analysis.30 The authors defined asthma as the occurrence of at least three episodes of wheezing, which in itself does not exclude continuing recurrent viral wheeze on any pathological grounds, but it would also include those with asthma. No surprise then that \u2018asthma\u2019 by this definition was predicted by RSV infection. This study used matched controls that were enrolled contemporaneously (i.e. during a RSV epidemic). Surprisingly few of them (2%) had wheez at follow-up and neither had anyone with a family history of asthma who did not have RSV bronchiolitis. So another interpretation of their findings is that the failure to develop bronchiolitis during an RSV epidemic is a negative risk factor for the development of asthma and allergy.3 If the selection of controls was biased against development of asthma, any subsequent immunological differences in the RSV group would be similarly skewed.",

The strongest evidence that there is a causal link between RSV bronchiolitis and the development of asthma or the induction of atopic sensitisation comes from animal studies. Firstly, in guinea pigs and rats, type 2 responses have been demonstrated following RSV infections.3., 25. However, this type of response has mainly been seen when formalin-inactivated viruses have been used. Studies in mice have shown that viral infections interact with inhaled allergens to promote the development of airway inflammation and atopic sensitisation.25 In human infants, a type 2 skewed response has been indicated by low IFN-\u03b3 and relatively raised IL-4 levels in peripheral monocyte blood cells from RSV-infected infants.31 This could represent increased susceptibility to RSV infection in those with a pre-existing impaired type 1 response, or that the type 2 skewed response could be the result of the infection. The latter is supported by the finding of increased IL-10 by stimulated monocytes during convalescence from RSV bronchiolitis in children who went on to have recurrent episodes of wheezing.32 The number of subsequent wheezing episodes correlated with the convalescent IL-10 values. Since no differences were found during the acute phase, it suggests a virus-induced change in cytokine response. Whether this translates into atopic asthma still has to be determined.",

This line of argument is re-inforced by the finding of an association between IL-4 polymorphisms and severe RSV bronchiolitis.33 Furthermore, although adults with atopic asthma are not at increased risk of rhinovirus infection, they have been shown to experience more frequent and severe lower respiratory tract symptoms.34 As a unifying explanation, it has been suggested that genetic variations in CD14 and other pattern recognition receptors may influence both clinical expression of viral disease and the development of allergy.3\n",

Virus and host characteristics probably determine the size of the response, as reduced lung function and the presence of atopy increases the effect. In a recent study of virus-induced lower airway changes in adults without asthma who were inoculated with coronavirus, those with a history of viral wheeze showed a greater degree of cold symptoms, greater falls in FEV1 and larger increases in bronchial responsiveness than those without such a history.38 As no effect of atopy was seen and there were no differences in baseline measurements, an as yet unidentified additional factor is suggested.",

            "text": "This subject has aroused much interest in the past few years because of the findings of an effect of birth order and family size, as surrogate markers of infection load, on the development of allergy.3., 23., 36. A protective role of infections has also been seen in developing countries, where an inverse relationship between evidence of respiratory infections (serological or actual infections such as measles) and later development of atopy has been found.25 One possibility is that these findings could have resulted from a genetic bias in confined communities. This is unlikely as there was a similarly reduced prevalence of atopic disease in East Germany compared with the genetically similar population of West Germany.39 The East German children were assumed to have been exposed to more infections because of the much greater use of early daycare, which in itself has been associated with less subsequent asthma.39 There is, however, a paradox as several studies show that parental reports of lower respiratory illnesses are positively associated with later asthma.3 A little discussed reason for possible confusion is the variation in the definitions of asthma that have been used. When immune modulation is being considered as a factor in the development of asthma, two not uncommon definitions are flawed: occurrence of more than three wheezy episodes and wheeze beyond 3 years. Firstly, children with \u2018transient\u2019 wheeze often experience more than three episodes and therefore could, by this definition, be wrongly categorised as asthma. Secondly, children with recurrent wheeze following RSV infection, which is independent of atopy, may not remit until 6\u201313 years.20 A further explanation for the apparent paradox is put forward by Mallia et al.3 Daycare use and large family size reflect an increased viral load which includes gastrointestinal viruses and is independent of the host response. In contrast, parental reporting of symptoms reflects the host response. Children destined to have asthma have an impaired type 1 response to virus infections and are therefore at risk of more frequent and severe symptoms, which are more likely to be reported. In an adult study, designed to avoid reporting bias, asthma and controls had the same number of upper respiratory infections, assessed by polymerase chain reaction but those with asthma reported more lower respiratory symptoms.34 In support of this line of reasoning, Illi et al. showed that repeated viral infections in early life, other than those of the lower respiratory tract, protected against asthma.39\n",

It has been a long-standing aim of clinicians to predict those who will have asthma later. In theory, anti-inflammatory treatment given early could modify the outcome. From population studies, risk factors, such as personal atopy or a family history of asthma, can be used to provide relative risks of developing asthma with reasonable accuracy,41 but for use in the individual, this approach is insufficiently sensitive. Since a type 2 skewed response (increased IgE, relative eosinophilia, raised s-ECP) to infection can be seen in infants destined to have persistent wheeze,40 information obtained from a blood test during the initial episode has the potential for predictive use. However, this information is unlikely to be available routinely.
