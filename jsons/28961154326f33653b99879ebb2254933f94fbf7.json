A number of associated events or conditions are strongly associated with the risk for developing BOS; these include acute rejection, gastroesophageal refl ux, infections, and autoimmune reactions that can occur in the setting of alloimmune responses to the lung allograft as recipients are given intense immunosuppression to prevent allograft rejection. The term chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) is being increasingly used to refer to recipients with late allograft dysfunction that meets the spirometric criteria for the diagnosis of BOS, but clinicians should recognize that such dysfunction can occur for a variety of reasons other than BOS. The recently identifi ed entity of restrictive allograft syndrome, which is now recognized as a relatively distinct phenotype of CLAD, has features that differentiate it from classic obstructive BOS.

Late decline in allograft function following recovery and stabilization of lung function after the initial lung implantation was increasingly encountered as more lung transplants were performed in the late 1980s, and the consensus document that suggested that the term bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) could be used to designate the syndrome of persistent loss of function with decline in FEV 1 that could not be explained by other, potentially reversible complications such as acute rejection or infection was published in 1993 [ 2 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 151, "end": 156, "text": "[ 1 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 901, "end": 906, "text": "[ 2 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Clinical experience that evolved over the subsequent 2 decades of lung transplantation has confi rmed that the pathologic fi nding that usually correlates with a persistent decline in post-transplant FEV 1 that is consistent with the clinical diagnosis of BOS is the presence of the lesion of OB.

Major considerations that led to choosing FEV 1 as a surrogate marker were (1) the relative diffi culty of obtaining adequate diagnostic tissue via transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) plus (2) the desire to avoid the substantially increased risks of performing more invasive diagnostic procedures (i.e., surgical lung biopsy), although more extensive sampling of lung tissue could facilitate a more confi dent diagnosis (and may be considered necessary in certain situations).

This syndrome was presumed to be caused by chronic allograft rejection, and the term chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) was coined and used to refer to allograft dysfunction that met the criteria that were adopted to indicate a diagnosis of BOS. Previously published consensus statements have designated a persistent decline in FEV 1 to \u226480 % of baseline post-transplant FEV 1 (that is present for a minimum of 3 weeks in the absence of confounding conditions) as a surrogate marker of probable OB (Table 1. 1 ), and a staging system was devised to qualify the level of FEV 1 decline, which correlates fairly well with severity of allograft dysfunction. By defi nition, 3 or more months were required to have elapsed from the time of transplantation in order for the diagnosis of BOS to be made [ 2 , 3 ] . This qualifi cation was made to help distinguish BOS from non-BOS acute and/or subacute complications of lung transplantation as well as to take into account the time needed to establish both a baseline FEV 1 and a confi rmed decline in FEV 1 with FEV 1 measurements taken 3 weeks apart. Because of concern that the cutoff value for FEV 1 at 80 % of the best post-transplant value may be insensitive to early decline in allograft function due to early OB, stage BOS-0p (FEV 1 = 81-90 % of baseline and/or FEF 25-75 \u2264 75 % of baseline) was added to the staging system to signify \"potential BOS\" [ 3 ] . One problem with this scheme is the considerable variation in FEV 1 values that some recipients may have due to the timing and fl uctuation in spirometric measurements caused by various post-transplant complications that can prevent a recipient from achieving a graft function plateau with reasonably stable posttransplant FEV 1 values that accurately represent the zenith of attainable function. Such fl uctuation and the consequent inability to establish stable post-transplant lung function make it diffi cult, if not impossible, to identify an accurate baseline value. The identifi cation of other surrogate markers (e.g., biomarkers) that accurately refl ect pathological airway and/or parenchymal processes for which specifi c interventions should be considered is much needed.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 293, "end": 298, "text": "[ 2 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1103, "end": 1112, "text": "[ 2 , 3 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1709, "end": 1714, "text": "[ 3 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 806, "end": 815, "text": "(Table 1.", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "An Overview of BOS Pathogenesis and Associated Risk Factors"}, {"text": "A considerable number of risk factors have been associated with the development of BOS (Table 1. 2 ). BOS is widely perceived as the physiological surrogate of an immunologically mediated phenomenon due to many observations that include its association with acute cellular rejection [ 4 ] , the association with greater degrees of HLA mismatch with BOS risk [ 5 ] , and evolving evidence of the involvement of autoimmune pathways [ 6 ] and the interplay of alloimmune and autoimmune processes that can lead to allograft rejection [ 7 ] . Furthermore, lung histopathology in patients with BOS shows striking similarities to the OB that can occur in allogeneic bone marrow or stem cell transplant recipients as well as constrictive bronchiolitis in patients with connective tissue diseases [ 8 -10 ] , and these airway changes are perceived as alloimmune or autoimmune disorders, respectively. Nonetheless, although BOS is frequently equated with the term chronic rejection, various interventions, including intensifi ed immunosuppression, may have little or no effect on the progressive loss of allograft function that is usually observed in lung transplant recipients who develop BOS. However, some patients can have signifi cant clinical responses to alternative immunomodulatory therapies such as total lymphoid irradiation [ 11 ] , or extracorporeal photopheresis [ 12 ] , although these responses generally consist of stabilization or a decrease in the tempo of lung function loss over time and are unlikely to improve lung function (see Chap. 16 ). In addition to alloimmune and/or autoimmune phenomena associated with BOS, various \"non-immune\" mechanisms have been implicated as playing a role in BOS pathogenesis. Although often referred to as nonimmune, these events/phenomena likely trigger or potentiate innate immune responses, which may also trigger or intensify alloimmune or autoimmune responses. These mechanisms include injury caused by primary graft dysfunction (PGD), gastroesophageal refl ux (GER), and infections caused by viruses, bacteria, or fungi [ 13 -15 ] . These likely involve allograft injury combined with triggering of innate immune responses that may also trigger or potentiate alloimmune/adaptive immune responses PGD, which affects 10-25 % of all lung transplants and is a leading cause of early morbidity and mortality, represents a form of acute lung injury that is considered to occur largely as a consequence of the periods of ischemia and reperfusion as the donor lung is procured and then implanted in the recipient [ 16 -19 ] . Although a number of studies have not consistently linked PGD to BOS [ 20 -24 ] , more recent studies support a link between PGD and the development of BOS [ 25 -27 ] . Daud et al. [ 25 ] found a convincing association of PGD grade with increased risk of developing BOS Stage 1 using International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) consensus defi nitions for PGD, and a more recent analysis of outcomes by this group identifi ed a direct relationship between PGD severity at 24, 48, and 72 h post-transplant and increased risk of BOS [ 28 ] . The most severe grade of PGD (grade 3) at all three time points was associated with the highest risk of developing BOS (RR was 3.31 for grade 3 PGD at 24 h).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 283, "end": 288, "text": "[ 4 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 358, "end": 363, "text": "[ 5 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 430, "end": 435, "text": "[ 6 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 530, "end": 535, "text": "[ 7 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 788, "end": 797, "text": "[ 8 -10 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1326, "end": 1332, "text": "[ 11 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1367, "end": 1373, "text": "[ 12 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1548, "end": 1550, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2071, "end": 2081, "text": "[ 13 -15 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2556, "end": 2566, "text": "[ 16 -19 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2638, "end": 2648, "text": "[ 20 -24 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2725, "end": 2735, "text": "[ 25 -27 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2750, "end": 2756, "text": "[ 25 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 3120, "end": 3126, "text": "[ 28 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 87, "end": 96, "text": "(Table 1.", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "An Overview of BOS Pathogenesis and Associated Risk Factors"}, {"text": "The presence of signifi cant GER (GER that is increased in frequency/severity over what is considered normal) increases the risk that refl uxate can be aspirated into the lower respiratory tract and has been linked to both subacute and chronic lung allograft dysfunction [ 29 -36 ] .

They reported that DAD was seen at least once on TBLB in 320/720 (44 %) recipients, and early DAD (\u22643 months post-transplant) was associated with a significantly increased mortality risk. They also found that bilateral lung recipients with adequate pulmonary function testing to distinguish RAS from BOS had earlier onset of BOS if early DAD was detected. Additionally, late new-onset DAD (>90 days post-transplant) was a signifi cant risk factor for developing RAS. A review of temporal changes on lung biopsy in recipients with RAS showed that DAD tended to be followed by development of pleuroparenchymal fi broelastosis [ 100 ] . Additional characterization of a subset of patients showed that ground-glass opacities on HRCT correlated with DAD episodes, and such episodes were accompanied by a decline in lung function with subsequent stabilization during interval periods that correlated with allograft fi brosis [ 101 ] . The existence of distinct phenotypes on the basis of length of time from transplant to BOS development and the tempo of disease progression have been suggested in the literature.
