The similarities between East and West are that COPD is a disease of older individuals, is linked to the local smoking prevalence, and the trend is of rising mortality and morbidity. The differences are in the size of the disease burden between genders and in the trend rate, which is largely related to the \u201cmaturity\u201d of the cigarette-smoking epidemic and the population demographics, compounded by other risk factors such as indoor air pollution from biomass fuel combustion and poorer socioeconomic circumstances.",

Studies have demonstrated an increased risk of COPD within families with COPD probands. Some of this risk may be due to shared environmental factors, but several studies34\n35 in diverse populations have also suggested a shared genetic risk. To date, \u03b11-antitrypsin (\u03b11-AT) deficiency, a major circulating serine protease inhibitor, is the only genetic factor that is definitely linked to the development of emphysema or COPD, independent of tobacco exposure. Affected individuals have a 40-fold increase in the risk of the development of COPD compared to unaffected people. This rare hereditary deficiency is a recessive trait most commonly seen in individuals of Northern European origin and is extremely rare among Asians. Limited data have failed to link COPD with \u03b11-AT deficiency in Chinese either by determining the levels in the serum36 or by genotyping and electrophoretic phenotyping for cases of PiZ and PiS.37\n38 Although variants of \u03b11-AT deficiency have been reported such as variant Siiyama in Japan,39 and METokyo an Mpirare among Chinese, they have not been linked to COPD.38\n",

The respiratory abnormalities increase in proportion to the number of cigarettes smoked.56\n57 Pipe and cigar smokers also have greater COPD morbidity and mortality rates than nonsmokers, but their rates are lower than those for cigarette smokers.55 Passive exposure to cigarette smoke (also known as environmental tobacco smoke) may also contribute to chronic respiratory symptoms and COPD by increasing the burden of inhaled particles and gases.3 Environmental tobacco smoke exposure is increasingly recognized in Asia as an important risk factor for COPD in nonsmokers.30\n",

It is not routinely offered to COPD patients in Asia but is given by some pulmonologists or in response to requests from patients.80 Even in patients who require frequent hospitalizations, the prevalence of influenza vaccination is < 12%.17 Possible reasons for this include concern about allergenicity, low surveillance data from tropical countries, apparent lack of or a bimodal seasonality in tropical countries and hence uncertainty about the number of vaccinations, and a lack of reimbursement. However, in a world altered by the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in 2003, the specter of bird flu, and clinical trial data16\n90 on the efficacy of flu vaccination in Asian patients with COPD, there is now wider acceptance of the role of influenza vaccination in COPD patients.",

The overall burden of COPD is several-fold greater in Asia than in the West, and is mainly determined by the size of the risk factors and the phase of the tobacco epidemic in the region. Treatment aims in Asian countries are based on evidence-based management guidelines. Barriers to the implementation of disease management guidelines are related to issues of resource conflict and lack of organizational support rather than cultural differences in medical practice. There is a need for a multifaceted approach in improving the awareness of prevalence and disease burden, in facilitating the accurate diagnosis of COPD among chronic respiratory diseases, and in championing health policies that reduce the burden of the main risk factors for COPD and the wider use of evidence-based management for COPD.",
