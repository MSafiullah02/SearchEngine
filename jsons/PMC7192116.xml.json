Epic\u24c7 is particularly dominant in larger hospitals and health organizations, and in 2018 had 28% market share of the 5,447 acute care hospitals in the US 17. MyChart\u00ae\ufe0f is a HIPAA-protected patient access portal that is included in Epic\u00ae\ufe0f. It allows patients to access their charts to view medical records, lab and imaging results, share their records with other providers, update their conditions, schedule appointments, and message providers18. Patients can access this portal with their personal Apple\u24c7 or Android\u2122 devices, tablets, desktop or laptop computer, and is free of charge. Having access to this portal is essential for both e-visits and video visits to be properly conducted. If this or a similar portal is not available, however, alternative audiovisual platforms can be used to meet the requirements for a video telemedicine visit.",

If an institution has not integrated audiovisual capabilities into the existing EMR system, these platforms are attractive options for conducting telemedicine visits. If MyChart video visit capability is incorporated into your Epic EMR system, the commercially available video conferencing software should be used as a last resort. Initiation of video calls using these platforms from personal devices, however, may disclose personal numbers and addresses. Doximity, an online networking service for medical professionals, has a feature (Doximity Dialer) that permits substitution of whatever telephone number is needed, such as the provider\u2019s general clinic, to appear on the recipient\u2019s device (https://www.doximity.com/download/general?c=web_mast_logged_out&pid=internal_marketing.) A new video feature was recently added to their application. It is free for Doximity users and enables communication between Apple\u24c7 and Android\u2122 devices. Through this application, a text message is sent to any smartphone device and contains a video link that permits easy video connectivity. In our experience, this is the easiest way to connect with patients outside of approved portals and is especially useful if patients are enrolled in programs such as MyChart so they can receive printed after-visit instructions.",

This was very helpful to demonstrate the myriad of potential obstacles and solutions to video visits through the patient portal. While telemedicine is currently built as a physician platform, we included our front desk and nursing staff within our telemedicine model to mimic a standard in-person encounter. For the first week, we limited the scheduling of all telemedicine visits to 30 minutes for both new and return patient visits. Once familiarity and competence was demonstrated, providers could then choose to increase their templates to accommodate a larger number of patients per day.",

The patients are also advised of the potential advantages of the telemedicine visit, such as not postponing their healthcare needs while staying safely at home, having the ability to save travel and waiting times, and avoiding the expenses associated with transportation and parking. The nursing staff calls patients approximately 1 week ahead of their appointment to confirm their preferred method of audiovisual connection. Depending on the device, our staff will send instructions on how to download the necessary applications and access MyChart.com (see eDocument 1). Fifteen minutes before the telemedicine appointment time, a member of our nursing staff calls the patient to confirm connectivity and then completes a review of patient history, medications, and allergies. This information is entered into the chart exactly as during an in-person encounter. The provider is then fully equipped to initiate an efficient telemedicine visit at the scheduled appointment time.",

Flexibility in video connection options has been paramount although the majority have been able to successfully connect via a simple link sent through the Doximity video application function.
