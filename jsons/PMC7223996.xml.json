The association between infection and subsequent VTE in ICH patients is unclear. Patients with ICH are often immobile, placing them at increased risk for venous stasis and thrombotic events. Immobility is also a risk factor for some types of infection, such as pneumonia and decubitus ulcer infections. VTE occurs in 2\u20139% of patients hospitalized with ICH [1\u20133], with an associated mortality of 26% when left untreated [3]. Less than 20% of patients with ICH are started on prophylactic anticoagulation (AC) [4] during their hospital stay, despite demonstration in meta-analyses of benefit from both initiation of VTE chemoprophylaxis [5] and resumption of therapeutic AC [6].",

Nosocomial infections in ICH patients are associated with hematoma volume, lower Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), and deep location [11\u201313]. Infection in ICH patients is associated with greater discharge mortality and worse 90-day outcomes [11\u201313]. There has been some exploration into the association between infection and VTE occurrence in ICH patients [13]. The role of infection on timing of subsequent VTE risk during hospitalization for ICH patients has not been investigated.

These events were defined as per guideline criteria [17\u201321], and were further adjudicated in weekly meetings by a group of study physicians and coordinators. A diagnosis of BSI required culture positivity from sterile blood cultures. Gastrointestinal infection required the presence of diarrhea and PCR positivity for C. difficile [18]. Respiratory infections were defined as pneumonia in the setting of a combination of fever, leukocytosis, increased pulmonary secretions, increased oxygen requirements, focal consolidation on chest X-ray, and culture positive bronchial alveolar lavage when available [19]. UTI diagnosis was made in the setting of inflammatory urinalysis that reflexed to culture with positive bacteria [20]. Ventriculitis/meningitis diagnosis required cerebral spinal fluid with the combination of elevated white cell count, low glucose, elevated CSF lactate, and culture positivity [21]. The date of complication was documented as the date of collection of a positive culture or the date of clinical suspicion and initiation of antibiotics in the absence of culture data. Time to infection was calculated as NICU admission day to date of complication. Infections that occurred prior to incident ICH were not recorded.

It is worth noting that there were no differences in times to pharmacologic DVT prophylaxis between groups. And in parallel, the vast majority of patients who developed DVT encountered this complication outcome after the initiation of pharmacologic DVT prophylaxis. Our median [IQR] days to initiation of DVT prophylaxis was 3 [2\u20134] days and most likely reflects our center\u2019s practice of initiating DVT prophylaxis 24\u201348 h from hemorrhage stability on follow-up imaging.

It could be a marker of underlying medical illness or a marker of the pro-inflammatory cascade leading to downstream endothelial dysfunction and thrombosis risk. It is known that both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke induce local inflammation [10, 11, 27], and it is possible that subsequent infection further triggers inflammatory responses, leading to excessive activation of coagulation [9, 28] and impairment of fibrinolysis [29] resulting in massive thrombin formation and fibrin deposition [8] and microvascular thrombosis. Infection, and notably sepsis, induces a marked pro-inflammatory and prothrombotic systemic environment [28].

            "text": "Though our study strengths include prospectively collected data, consensus adjudication of complications (both infection and VTE), and a single-center cohort that uses a relatively homogenous diagnostic and treatment protocol for ICH and its complications, there are several notable limitations worth mentioning. The generalizability of the findings is limited given the single-center cohort and low numbers of VTEs in this study. The retrospective analysis created some limitation in accounting completely for comorbidities not initially collected. This study was also limited by the inclusion of only symptomatic VTE. Future studies that screen for both infection and VTE in all patients should be considered in order to identify and clarify the biologic link between infection and VTE. Additionally, the timing data regarding both infection and VTE onset were difficult to determine with certainty. Thus, the chronology between infection and VTE is somewhat speculative; however, the adjudication of hospital complications by group consensus helped mitigate this limitation. Furthermore, while the use of the date of diagnosis of infection and VTE rather than date of clinical suspicion may be seen as a limitation, using the latter would have most likely resulted in a shortened time to event and would most likely have strengthened the model. Further investigation is warranted to clarify the biologic drivers behind the association of infection and subsequent VTE as well as why particular infection types such as pulmonary and hematologic infection impact downstream VTE occurrence over others. Our findings could suggest the importance of adoption of early infection control practices not only in preventing infection, but in potentially preventing downstream VTE. However, further study into the impact on VTE utilizing specific techniques such as minimizing ventilator time with early weaning protocols, early Foley removal, minimizing use of CVCs, and early physical therapy including ambulation of patients even when ventilated would be informative for this cause. Conversely, further work is required to evaluate whether the development of infection necessitates not only the early initiation of pharmacologic DVT prophylaxis to prevent VTE in this high-risk patient population, but perhaps a more optimal dose. The inflammatory cascade set in motion in response to infection might be particularly damaging to this fragile population and perhaps earlier and more aggressive strategies for VTE prevention should be considered in ICH patients in the setting of infection.",
