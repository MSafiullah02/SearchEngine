Here, we aimed to study the viral role in ARI in residents of ECC of Lisbon, during the 2013/14 winter.

All assays shared identical amplification conditions (50 \u00b0C for 30 min, 95 \u00b0C for 2 min, 45 cycles at 95 \u00b0C for 15 s, and 60 \u00b0C for 1 min), allowing all four panels to run simultaneously on the same instrument. An additional monoplex assay specific for HBoV was also included in this study (Table 1\n). Amplification and detection of PCR products were performed using the Rotorgene\u2122 PCR system (Qiagen) acquiring the fluorescence on FAM, JOE, CY5, and ROX channels at each cycle. Samples and negative control (molecular grade water) were individually spiked with MS2 bacteriophage internal control (4,600 pfu per extraction) prior to nucleic acid extraction to identify any inhibitors. Positive controls for all panels were made from a combination of recombinant plasmids and from known positive specimens, diluted to give a cycle threshold value of 20\u201325.",

Interestingly, A(H1) was not detected in this study, although this virus circulated in the Portuguese population during this winter and in a proportion equivalent to that of A(H3) (Cristov\u00e3o et al., 2014). The rates of influenza A(H3) infections between vaccinated and unvaccinated residents were quite similar, suggesting a low effectiveness of the vaccine. As a possible explanation, we observed that all analyzed strains were antigenically dissimilar from vaccine strain 2013/14. Interestingly, influenza cases in vaccinated elderly were not associated with serious infections in this study, which is in accordance with the information from Public Health authorities that vaccination for influenza is aimed mainly to prevent complications (CDC, 2016). Nevertheless, it remains unclear if this was the result of vaccine protection, because the six unvaccinated residents with influenza infection did not experience serious illness as well.",

The Taqman arrays cards allowed us to detect 2 more viruses in these severe infections, suggesting that if they were used in all the patients, the rate of viral detection could have been higher than using PCR alone. But the major contribution of this technique was for the atypical bacteria: L. pneumophila was detected in 6 patients (in 2 different ECC), and all of them subsequently died. When comparing Taqman array cards and multiplex PCR results for viral detection, some differences were detected (Table 5), but only in samples with low viral load.

Moreover, the mortality rate, usually between 8\u201312%, is higher in elderly people (Phin et al., 2014). Therefore, despite the fact that 3 of the fatal cases had mixed infections with viruses (2 with HMPV and 1 with rhinovirus) there is a high probability that this bacteria could have contributed to these fatalities. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude that viruses could have had an important contribution as well; autopsy was not ordered in any of the fatalities, and post-mortem lung specimens were not collected, which could have helped to clarify this situation. Infections caused by L. pneumophila have been described in ECC but often go undetected (Seenivasan et al., 2005), most facilities do not have the level of microbiology laboratory support that is available to acute care hospitals, and only if the resident is transferred to the hospital will he/she have access to different methods to detect this bacterium. Another important point is the fact that the L. pneumophila infection rate was probably underestimated, for the following reasons: L. pneumophila was searched only in severe infections, and more cases could have been found if this bacterium were searched in all patients; L. pneumophila infections show a seasonal pattern, with peak activity in late summer to autumn, and this study was held during the winter (Phin et al., 2014); and finally, upper respiratory samples are not the best samples for the diagnosis of these infections (Cho et al., 2012). All of the detected cases were notified to the National surveillance scheme so that environmental research could be triggered. At the end of the study a recommendation for the use of a urinary antigen test for Legionella was made to the ECC medical teams involved, but also a public discussion of these findings was conducted by our team.",
