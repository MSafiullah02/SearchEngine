            "text": "For many diseases, the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) is a threshold parameter for disease extinction or survival in isolated populations. However no human population is fully isolated from other human or animal populations. We use compartmental models to derive simple rules for the basic reproduction number in populations where an endemic disease is sustained by a combination of local transmission within the population and exposure from some other source: either a reservoir exposure or imported cases. We introduce the idea of a reservoir-driven or importation-driven disease: diseases that would become extinct in the population of interest without reservoir exposure or imported cases (since R 0 < 1), but nevertheless may be sufficiently transmissible that many or most infections are acquired from humans in that population. We show that in the simplest case, R 0 < 1 if and only if the proportion of infections acquired from the external source exceeds the disease prevalence and explore how population heterogeneity and the interactions of multiple strains affect this rule. We apply these rules in two case studies of Clostridium difficile infection and colonisation: C. difficile in the hospital setting accounting for imported cases, and C. difficile in the general human population accounting for exposure to animal reservoirs. We demonstrate that even the hospital-adapted, highly-transmissible NAP1/RT027 strain of C. difficile had a reproduction number <1 in a landmark study of hospitalised patients and therefore was sustained by colonised and infected admissions to the study hospital. We argue that C. difficile should be considered reservoir-driven if as little as 13.0% of transmission can be attributed to animal reservoirs.",

Estimates of the reservoir-driven threshold for C. difficile in human populations and its dependence on the prevalence of each of four risk groups. In each subfigure, the prevalence in one risk group is varied across the reported range (Furuya-Kanamori et al., 2015a) (x-axes) while the other three prevalences are fixed at the values indicated by the vertical lines in the other subfigures. We consider two scenarios; one where each of the fixed prevalences is assumed to be in the middle of the reported range (solid lines and curves); the other the same except the prevalence in infants is only 25% (dotted lines and curves).

Moreover, the latter method assumes 2 that the reproduction is less than one so is not appropriate in 3 settings where is there is genuine uncertainty as to whether the 4 reproduction number is above or below one (Cauchemez et al., 5 2013). Our model accounts for susceptible depletion and works 6 for infections where the reproduction number is above or below 7 one, but relies on estimates of prevalence to do so. This can pose 8 a potential difficulty as often incidence rather than prevalence is 9 reported. Reliable estimates of prevalence either requires near- 2 Some caution is required when using the reservoir-driven and 3 importation-driven thresholds.

Colonisa-20 tion is typically transient, lasting approximately one month in 21 adults (Johnson et al., 1992), due to competition and interactions 22 with other intestinal flora (Britton and Young, 2012). Disruption 23 of the gut flora, often caused by consumption of antibiotics or 24 proton-pump-inhibitors, allows C. difficile to proliferate in large 25 numbers (Britton and Young, 2012). Toxigenic strains of C. difficile 26 then produce a number of toxins that can cause diarrhoea which 27 is often severe and sometimes life-threatening (Voth and Ballard, 28 2005). A robust immune response to these toxins is able to 29 neutralise their effect (Kelly and Kyne, 2011) and most of the pop-30 ulation have anti-toxin antibodies starting at a young age (Viscidi 31 et al., 1983).

C. difficile in hospitals 74 If we begin by modelling C. difficile in hospitals as a 75 (homogenous) SIS model with very high rates of migration (hos-76 pital admission and discharge) then we can estimate the repro-77 duction number using the method outlined in Section 3.3. In 78 words, we will estimate the within-hospital reproduction number 79 as equation which is given in Box I 80 One study of colonisation and infections in hospitalised pa-81 tients found 184 patients colonised at the time of admission, 82 and another 240 patients that acquired colonisation or infection 83 after admission (Loo et al., 2011). They identified an additional 84 60 or so patients who were asymptomatic at the time of admis-85 sion but developed symptomatic C. difficile infection within 72 h 86 of admission and were therefore deemed to have acquired the 87 pathogen prior to admission. Thus, the proportion of C. difficile 88 positive patients that acquired the pathogen prior to admission 89 was approximately 50%.90 In the same study 528/5422 patients were colonised or de-91 veloped an infection for part of their hospital stay. Some pa-92 tients were excluded from their analysis (mostly for missing 93 data) leaving 424/4143 patients that were colonised or developed 94 an infection for part of the hospital stay. While these do not 95 provide an estimate of prevalence (since many of the colonised 96 or infected patients were only colonised for part of the hospital 97 stay) these figures provide upper bounds to the prevalence of 98 colonisation and infection in the study hospital: 9.7% amongst 99 all study patients and 10.2% after exclusions. Putting this into 100 the above formula gives an upper bound for the within-hospital YTPBI: 2772 Please cite this article as: A. McLure and K.

Proportion of colonisations and infections acquired prior to admission 1 \u2212 Prevalence of colonisation and infection . Box I. in infectiousness alone does not affect the estimate of the re-1 production number (Section 4.2). Factors affecting susceptibility 2 to colonisation exist and adjusting for these will increase our 3 estimate of the reproduction number (Section 4.1), but this is 4 unfortunately beyond the scope of this case study. However, our 5 simple estimates of R 0 are in agreement with more sophisticated 6 models of C. difficile transmission in hospitals that have found that 7 the reproduction number is likely to be less than one in many or 8 most hospital settings (Lanzas et al., 2011; McLure et al., 2017). 9 There are many strains and types of C. difficile and it has been 10 suggested that certain strains or types, such as NAP1/RT027, are 11 particularly hospital-adapted (Fawley et al., 2016; Knight et al., 12 2015). It is possible that these strains have significantly higher 13 reproduction numbers in the hospital than we have estimated 14 above and thus may be self-sustaining in hospitals. Unfortunately, 15 we do not have strain-level or type-level data for all strains or 16 types. However, the article used to calculate our first estimate 17 of the reproduction number report the proportion of infections 18 and colonisations typed as NAP1/RT027 (Loo et al., 2011). As 19 the authors did not type all isolates, we assume that un-typed 20 isolates were equally likely to be NAP1/RT027 as the isolates 21 from similar patients that were typed, and that the proportion 22 of NAP1/RT027 infections in those with onset <72 h after admis-23 sion (not reported) was similar to patients with colonisation at 24 admission (13%). Under these assumptions, approximately 32 out 25 of 150 (21%) colonisations or infections with NAP1/RT027 were 26 present at admission. Of the approximately 10% of cases that 27 were colonised or infected for some part of their hospital stay, 28 approximately 3% were with NAP1/RT027 and the remaining 7% 29 were with other types. Though colonisation with non-toxigenic 30 strains appears to be protective against infection with toxigenic 31 strains (Gerding et al., 2015), we do not have good information 32 about the interaction of C. difficile types. Nevertheless, we can use 33 the argument we presented in Section 5 to bound the invasion 34 reproduction number. This becomes as in Box II 35 The basic reproduction number (i.e. in a completely suscepti-36 ble population without competition with other types) is slightly 37 greater (see Box III) 38 This suggests that even if other strains were eliminated and 39 NAP1/RT027 did not compete for hosts, the continual importation 40 of colonised and infected individuals would be required to sustain 41 endemic disease in the study hospital. If we perform the same 42 analysis for the pooled non-NAP1/RT027 strains in the study 43 (approximately 212 of 334 colonisations and infections were 44 present on admission) the equivalent upper bounds for the in-45 vasion reproduction number and basic reproduction number are 46 both approximately 0.4. Therefore, it appears that NAP1/RT027, though importation-driven, was better adapted for transmission 48 in the study hospital than other strains. 49 It is worth providing some clarifying remarks about how these 50 estimates of reproduction numbers should and should not be 51 interpreted. As noted in Section 3.3, these reproduction num-52 bers do not include any secondary cases that may arise from 53 the primary case following discharge, either in the community 54 or during a subsequent readmission to a hospital (either the 55 same hospital or a different one). A reproduction number that 56 counted these secondary cases would be strictly higher than 57 those estimated here. Nevertheless, the reproduction numbers 58 estimated here are threshold parameters for disease extinction 59 in individual hospitals in the absence of imported cases. Since 60 our calculations suggest that this reproduction number is likely to 61 be below the critical threshold of one, it follows that preventing 62 the admission of colonised individuals, or the effective isolation 63 of patients colonised at admission would drive within-hospital 64 transmission to extinction, a conclusion corroborated by some 65 quasi-experimental studies (Longtin et al., 2016). However, note 66 that this conclusion would hold true even if all patients who 67 are colonised on admission are patients who have acquired the 68 pathogen in a previous hospital stay. Consequently, based on 69 these calculations alone, we cannot conclude that eliminating all 70 transmission in hospitals would not also eliminate (or dramati-71 cally reduce) the proportion of admissions that are colonised at 72 admission. In other words, the calculations in this paper imply 73 that the admission of colonised patients is essential for the main-74 tenance of endemicity in hospitals, but do not imply the converse 75 statement, that within-hospital transmission is not essential for 76 the maintenance of endemicity in hospitals. Nevertheless, we 77 have previously used models of C. difficile transmission in hos-78 pitals and the broader community that are better able to answer 79 this question to demonstrate that this converse is also likely to 80 hold in most settings (McLure et al., 2019a,b).",

If we assume separable 6 mixing with heterogeneous susceptibility and infectious period, 7 we need only the prevalence in each group and the proportion of 8 the population that is in each group to estimate the reservoir-9 driven threshold (Eq. (7)). The reported range of colonisation 10 prevalence in each of these groups is (A) 0%-29%, (B) 0%-51%, (C) 11 18%-90% and (D) 0%-15% respectively (Furuya-Kanamori et al., 12 2015a), while the total proportion of the population in each of 13 these groups in a developed country like Australia is (A) <0.5% 14 (OECD, 2015), (B) <1% (Australian Institute of Health Welfare, 15 2010), (C) <1.5% (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2017) and (D) 16 >97% respectively. 17 If we use the upper end of the prevalence range for each 18 risk group, though only 16.6% of the population is colonised, the 19 reservoir-driven threshold is 48.0%. Assuming a lower colonisa-20 tion prevalence in the majority population (D) decreases over-21 all prevalence but increases heterogeneity and can increase the 22 reservoir-driven threshold. If only 1% of the healthy adult popula-23 tion is colonised, then overall prevalence is 3.0% but the reservoir-24 driven threshold is much higher at 81.1%. These extreme values 25 taken from across the literature are not typical and are unlikely to 26 coincide in a single population. If we consider more typical values 27 of colonisation prevalence, the picture is quite different.

It could be the case that some strains are sustained by 56 exposure to animals, while other strains -though also present 57 in animal populations -are sufficiently transmissible between 58 humans to persist without transmission from animals. C. difficile 59 PCR ribotype 078 (RT078) is a particularly good candidate to 60 consider as a reservoir-driven strain.

Another potential difficulty with 16 our method of estimating reproduction numbers comes when one 17 tries to estimate the proportion of cases that are attributable to 18 the reservoir or importation. It is often easier to demonstrate 19 that there is some movement of pathogens into the population 20 of interest from reservoirs or other populations, than to estimate 21 the proportion of cases in the population that can be directly at-22 tributed to these external sources. Even in our case study, though 23 genetic evidence demonstrates transmission of C. difficile between 24 animals and humans (Knetsch et al., 2018), the proportion of 25 transmission from animals remains completely unknown.

This is true whether or not the 24 disease is reservoir-driven. A similar rule can be derived for the 25 SIS model with imported cases. 26 The major limitation of our method is the assumption that the 27 disease and population are at equilibrium. Many diseases, includ-28 ing our case study disease C. difficile, exhibit seasonal variation 29 (Furuya-Kanamori et al., 2015b).

Similarly, it 33 possible that exposure to the reservoir is seasonal (Rodriguez-34 Palacios et al., 2009).
