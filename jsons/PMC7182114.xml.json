By adding the suffix virus, the names of the genus are automatically Latinized. The recommendation of the Committee is lawful as regards the genus. It is noted that the termination corresponds to usage. Such names as Adenovirus, Myxovirus, and Poliovirus have long been in use.4.Each genus must have a type species. This is an indispensable measure in order to assure the stability of the name of the genus and in order to avoid interminable and irrelevant discussions.

Since viruses are reproduced from their genetic material, it follows that the whole virus, including the virion, is determined by the base sequence of its nucleic acid. Provided the code is entirely deciphered,\u2014as today it is\u2014knowing the base sequence of the structural genes means knowing the amino acid sequence of the proteins. Yet, for the time being, it is impossible to deduce the tertiary and quaternary structures of a protein from its amino acid sequence. Moreover, the architecture of a protein may be modified by various ligands. Of course, we all hope that in a not-too-distant future, the knowledge of the primary structure of the viral proteins will permit the deduction of the symmetry, size, and organization of the virion. This is not yet the case.Finally, let us assume that we are able to reconstruct the phylogeny of a given virus. Mutations have lead to substitution of amino acids, and to antigenic alterations. The question is immediately raised: how many amino acid substitutions will be needed in order to consider that we are dealing with a new species or a new genus? Not only the number of substitutions will have to be taken into account, but also their nature. If a few hundred amino acids belonging to twenty species are involved, one can foresee great battles.In Lanni's system, the base sequence of the nucleic acid is selected because it determines the properties of the virus and of the virion itself. Yet, if it is admitted that the most convenient classification of viruses is based on the virion, is it not simpler to consider the virion than the base sequence? We are afraid that, at least for a few years, it will be easier to state that a virion possesses DNA, a cubical symmetry, that to consider a list of 10,000 nucleotides. Lanni's system is a statement of inapplicable principles, and what virologists need is a real system.\n",
