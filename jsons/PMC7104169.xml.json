A recent review by Zowawi highlighted the worrying reports of extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase-producing isolates among Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae and the prevalence of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii\n[3]. With Saudi hospitals reporting soaring AMR rates, widespread misuse of antimicrobials and fears of resistance to last-resort antibiotics [3], [4], interventions are urgently required to curb inappropriate antimicrobial use and AMR rates. Implementing antimicrobial stewardship programmes (ASPs) in Saudi hospitals has been recommended to optimise the use of antimicrobials and to reduce AMR rates [4], [5]. The potential of these interventions has been recognised by the Saudi Ministry of Health (MoH) through the introduction of a national antimicrobial stewardship plan as part of the Arab Gulf regional strategy to reduce the threat of AMR [6].",

However, due to the shortage of ID consultants and microbiologists [2], these antimicrobial stewardship initiatives face sustainability challenges in tertiary care and are less likely to be implemented in secondary care where adoption of ASPs remains low [10]. Collaborations and the formation of ASP teams, including microbiologists, hospital pharmacists, physicians, nurses and infection control practitioners, could increase the capacity of hospitals to adopt ASPs and improve their implementation [11]. Although various studies have explored ASP team members\u2019 perspectives on programme adoption and implementation in healthcare systems where members\u2019 roles are well developed, data from healthcare systems such as Saudi Arabia, where ASP teams are novice, remain scarce. Understanding the experiences and perspectives of physicians, pharmacists, microbiologists, infection control practitioners, hospital managers, nurses and MoH personnel of ASP adoption could enhance the adoption of ASPs in Saudi hospitals. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the current ASP perspectives and experiences in Saudi MoH hospitals in order to identify factors influencing their adoption through a qualitative study.",

Lack of adherence to ASP policies and guidelines is due to three main factors. First, physicians are not always aware that such policies exist as this is not a routine part of their orientation programme (T2 Q1\u20132). Second, the ASP guidelines and policies are not always accessible electronically (T2 Q3) as the policies are distributed across the departments (by either the Infection Control Department or Pharmacy or both) often in a paper format that only a few staff members have direct access to. Third, poor enforcement and implementation of ASP policies is a significant contributing factor to the lack of adherence to this strategy. Participants suggested vertical enforcement by MoH and hospital management as a potential approach to improving engagement of physicians with the ASP strategy (T2 Q4\u20135).",

In which case, the physician is resorting to defensive prescribing in fear of legal or administrative proceedings (T9 Q1\u20134). Another concern is that the risks and benefits of antimicrobial prescribing are only considered for current patients and not future patients (T9 Q5). The participants also highlighted that influencing physicians\u2019 prescribing of antimicrobials can be a difficult path, either due to poor enforcement of guidelines, the liability pressure on physicians, or their personal traits and behaviours (T9 Q6\u20137).",

[30] and was unclear in the study by Aldosari [31]. The size of the hospital, however, significantly affected the adoption of EHRs and sophisticated IT infrastructure [31]. In relation to ASPs, tertiary hospitals in Saudi Arabia are more likely to have reliable microbiology facilities and to recruit ID physicians and clinical pharmacists, probably due to the availability of resources (financial and human). However, the remaining Saudi hospitals continue to report understaffing and/or shortage of ASP teams members, a barrier shared with hospitals in several other countries [32]. These teams will be responsible for co-ordinating education and training of healthcare professionals within the hospital. This education and training role is a key strategy to tackle the inappropriate antimicrobial prescribing behaviours of physicians [33]. This can be done, as part of a hospital-wide multifaceted approach, through dissemination of educational material [34], audit and feedback on performance [35], and manual and automated reminders [36].",
