To interrupt transmission and facilitate early identification of secondary cases, public health authorities at the state, county, and local levels, in consultation with subject-matter experts from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), mobilized rapidly to place the patients under appropriate isolation and identify contacts exposed to these patients. Enhanced contact investigations were conducted centered on nine patients, and included in-depth interviews to better characterize exposure type, exposure duration, and contact medical history, in addition to collection of respiratory specimens to identify asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic infections. This report summarizes results from these nine enhanced contact investigations, including information on exposures, active monitoring, laboratory testing, and secondary attack rates among close contacts.",

In one site, the presumed infectious period began on the date of symptom onset in the travel-associated case patient; however, in other sites, investigators also considered between one and three days before symptom onset in the travel-associated case patient. In all sites, the presumed infectious period ended when the travel-associated case patient was released from isolation. Generally, close contacts were defined as persons having frequent or more than brief contact (>1 -2 minutes within 6 ft) with a travel-associated case patient during the travel-associated case patient's presumed infectious period. Most sites also considered persons sharing the same airspace as the travel-associated case patient for more than ten minutes to be close contacts.

Among these 13, eight (including 3 significant others) were completely separated from the travel-associated case patient once the patient was diagnosed and isolated; these persons maintained separate living space throughout the period of case isolation. Two (25%) had <12 hours of exposure to the symptomatic travel-associated case patient before isolation, five (63%) had 1 -3 days of household exposure to the symptomatic travel-associated case patient before isolation, and one (13%) had eight days of household exposure to the symptomatic travel-associated case patient before isolation. Among these eight, three household members of two travel-associated case patients shared a travel history with the travel-associated case patient. All eight household members who were separated from the travel-associated case patients following diagnosis had serial specimens collected (median: 6.5 sets; range: 3 -7), and all persistently tested negative; the date of last specimen collection ranged from five to 14 days following last exposure. Five household members (including 4 significant others) across four households co-habited with the travel-associated case patient during the period of case isolation; none shared a travel history with the travel-associated case patient. None of these travel-associated case patients were hospitalized at any time. When following up with these four co-habiting households via phone and in-person visits, the COVID-19 Outbreak Response Teams noted moderate to very high adherence to recommended home isolation procedures: in two out of four households, the travel-associated case patient was able to use a separate bathroom, and in only one of four households did the COVID-19 Outbreak Response Team ever directly observe or learn of the travel-associated case patient spending time in the same room as their household member(s). All five household members undergoing co-habitation had multiple respiratory samples collected for testing (median: 5 sets; range: 3 -7) and remained SARS-CoV-2-negative throughout the period of co-habitation, with the last samples collected within seven days of the end of case isolation or the end of cohabitation.

Since the majority of these co-habiting case patients and close contacts adhered very well to home isolation precautions, it is possible that careful adherence to isolation protocols mitigated the transmission risk to household members co-habiting with travel-associated case patients during the period of case isolation.",

            "text": "This report is subject to several limitations. Because individual COVID-19 Outbreak Response Teams were operating out of distinct locations with unique considerations, the procedures of the investigation were heterogeneous across sites: different teams made different decisions regarding how to define close contacts, how to categorize exposure risk, which close contacts to actively monitor, which types of exposure information to collect, and how often (and from whom) to attempt collection of respiratory samples. Although available information was standardized across sites for the purposes of analysis, this heterogeneity led to missing data, limiting our ability to assess certain types of exposure in this population. Relatedly, only 47% of actively monitored close contacts provided any respiratory specimens, and fewer provided serial respiratory specimens. Incomplete sample collection could have biased secondary attack rates, and also raises the possibility of a missed asymptomatic infection. Symptomatic infections occurring after the end of the 14-day monitoring period also could have been missed. Although some sites attempted to reach individuals with close contact prior to symptom onset in the travel-associated case patient, many of these exposures occurred during the travel of the travelassociated case patient and therefore were managed by other jurisdictions. As a result, only nine such persons are included in the present analysis (of whom seven were household members with continued exposure). Thus, secondary transmissions occurring prior to symptom onset in the travel-associated case patient may have been missed. Missed transmissions (either asymptomatic infections, transmissions occurring outside the presumed infectious period, or transmissions with an incubation period outside the 14-day active monitoring period) may have contributed to community spread, as suggested by some genetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in Washington. 23 Lastly, although all sites endeavored to interview and sample the close contacts with the highestrisk exposures, the selection of the sample for interview and respiratory specimen collection was not systematic or consistent across sites. This may have introduced bias in the characteristics of the close contacts described as well as in the secondary attack rates.",

            "text": "The findings of these enhanced contact investigations, consistent with other research, suggest that household members of COVID-19 patients, particularly significant others, who are likely to have prolonged close contact with the patients, are at excess risk of developing COVID-19. 3, 12 Further, the lack of observed transmission to HCP underlines the importance and effectiveness of rapid identification and isolation of suspected cases of COVID-19 and appropriate use of PPE in caring for these patients 24, 25 . Careful adherence to infection prevention procedures within the home and the healthcare setting may help to reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19, while monitoring and quarantine of household contacts may help interrupt transmission. Close contacts with highrisk exposures (such as household contacts or HCP providing patient care without PPE) should continue to be quarantined and actively monitored, as data from COVID-19 clusters have raised the concern of transmission from asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, 18, 19, 26, 27 which may be contributing to the widespread community transmission that is currently occurring in the United States. 28 It is important for HCP and public health professionals to remain vigilant to the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from confirmed cases to household, community, and HCP contacts, and continue to emphasize isolation and other precautions. 6, 7 Further, individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 should self-quarantine, and all for use under a CC0 license.
