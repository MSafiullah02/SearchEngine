Sources: PubMed from 2012 to April 2018. Content: We found 17 eligible studies describing 13 539 patients. The median number of pathogens tested per individual was 3.5 (range 2e17). A causative pathogen could be determined for 6661 (49.2%) individuals. The most frequently reported pathogen during the study periods was dengue virus (DENV) (14 studies), followed by chikungunya virus (nine studies) and Zika virus (seven studies). Among the studies reporting concurrent infections, 296 individuals (2.2%) were found to have co-infections. Inhospital mortality was reported in eight (47%) studies, ranging between 0% and 18%. Implications: DENV fever is the febrile illness most frequently reported, reflecting its importance, while chikungunya and zika viruses present increasing trends since their emergence in the region. Studies with systematic and harmonized approaches for detection of multiple pathogens are needed and would probably reveal a higher burden of neglected pathogens such as Rickettsia spp. and arenaviruses. The lack of point-of-care tests and harmonized approach limits the care provided by health professionals and the efficacy of surveillance for AFI in the region.",

The progression from malaria to nonmalaria febrile illness (NMFI) has shaped the fever epidemiology landscape and exposed new challenges for management and control in the region [5] .

Similarly, others were more restricted and enrolled individuals with <72 h history of fever [11] . Second, most studies were conducted in reference hospitals, where diagnostics tests are more commonly available, contrasting with the reality of primary healthcare clinics. For these reference centres, most studies did not describe explicit referral and catchment area information, making it difficult to infer what occurs at the community level. Most studies also focused on non-severe febrile illnesses in the outpatient setting [16, 21] . The inclusion of severe febrile illness such as febrile patients admitted to hospitals could shed light on the burden caused by morbidity and mortality at these settings. Third, laboratory test definitions applied for confirmation also varied, and assays with different diagnostic accuracy performance were used.

Further, pathogens that are known to occur but not routinely tested were not evaluated in a significant proportion of the studies included, so the burden of such pathogens is probably underestimated.

From a clinical perspective, there is no clinical algorithm robust enough to distinguish between these three arboviruses. Clinical guidelines in Latin America recommend patients to be managed in the initial phase as DENV, as lack of early intervention can result in high rates of complications. Point-of-care diagnostics are of limited value, due to low sensitivity for some of the serotypes, while serology interpretation is challenged by previous exposure to DENV and other flaviviruses.",

Similarly, the empirical antimicrobial therapy for Enterobacteriaceae related-bacteraemia will require a combination of different agents (i.e. piperacillin/tazobactam, ciprofloxacin, meropenem) as the proportion of Gramnegative bacilli that are extended-spectrum b-lactam-positive is high in countries such as Brazil, Argentina, Mexico and Chile [61] .
