            "text": "Pandemic influenza is considered catastrophic to global health [8, 17]. Outbreaks cannot be predicted and attempts to trace the disease often have severe economic and social consequences [41]. Faced with this threat, many governments around the world have increased their emphasis on pandemic influenza preparedness and started to develop appropriate plans [34, 42]. As pandemic influenza preparation plans begin to be analyzed, one can first refer back to the SARS outbreak that occurred in many countries across Asia in November of 2002. The supplies of medical masks (e.g. N95 masks) rapidly ran out early in the outbreak [12]. The SARS crisis provides a concrete example of how national and international preparation of medical supply stocks is highly complex and incorporates many different elements, ranging from central government leadership decisions to operational instructions and the flow of information [16]. The experience of the SARS outbreak thus has changed the way many in the medical community view and react to the spread of infectious diseases. According to Coker and Mounier-Jack [24], investment in preparedness and planning with regard to medical supplies should provide benefits that extend beyond simply influenza pandemic control. Therefore, a strategy for the rapid deployment and delivery of essential medical supplies used for the prevention of influenza transmission and to alleviate the public panic caused by the expected shortage of such supplies needs to be developed [35, 43]. Effective logistics management of influenza preparation plans will not only optimize the response to such a catastrophe, but will also limit the effects of the disease in terms of morbidity, mortality, economic loss, and social disturbance [15, 22].",

            "text": "Unfortunately, the necessary stockpiles usually reside in a multitude of disparate, distributed medical supplies among hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies. Consequently, we cannot integrate such stockpiles within a time period short enough to prevent or even ameliorate the major consequences of an influenza pandemic. WHO [36, 37]emphasizes that the central task in any initiative to organize medical supplies information is the establishment of sentinel networks that not only have the capacity to respond to an outbreak of influenza, but also have the infrastructure to anticipate and potentially prevent threats from being realized, or, at the very least, to minimize their impact. Therefore, we employ integrated information concepts to develop a simulated medical material supply system model. Various scenarios are analyzed to derive the appropriate inventory policy needed under different pandemic influenza outbreaks, and to establish a mechanism of evaluating the stockpiles and requirements in the different phases of the pandemic. In this integrated information model, several medical institutions\u2019 medical supplies inventories are linked with the government\u2019s stockpile to leverage local medical institutions logistics management in an influenza pandemic crisis. The integrating of information derived from stockpile management facilitates a rapid response related to the distribution of medical supplies. The main functions of integrating the information are: (1) simulating a systematic procedure for conducting epidemic influenza operations; (2) adopting a concept of informational integration into medical material distribution; (3) employing fuzzy set theory to manage the stockpile of medical supplies; and (4) using XML technology, such as a standard text-exchange format, for the convenient sharing of medical supplies information.",

The highly pathogenic avian influenza is thought to be transferred through the swapping of genetic material between an avian virus and a human influenza virus (called re-assortment) in the same host (\u201cmixing vessel\u201d). It appears that this genetic re-assortment could result in a virus fully capable of spreading in human populations, resulting in pandemic influenza [6]. Consequently, the issue of global influenza pandemic has become an issue of pressing concern. To help deal with such outbreaks, identifying \u201cwarning signs\u201d (i.e. disease reports or surveillance) is critical, as is the ability to respond to emergencies quickly and effectively [3, 9].",

However, effective disease crisis management capacities require an initial investment to be setup, with recurring costs of maintenance and additional capital investment that is likely to decrease over time. The maintenance of existing information infrastructures, such as the national health and safety information network at work in hospitals today, would be a useful network for the distribution of information with regard to infectious disease pandemic management [36].",

In short, all logistics operations have to be designed in such a way that the right goods get to the right place and are distributed to the right people at the right time [33]. Logistics management is the part of supply chain management that plans, implements and controls the efficient and effective forward and reverse flow and storage of goods, services, and related information between the points of origin and consumption in order to meet customers' requirements [13]. An integrated logistics system includes inventory management, vendor relationships, transportation, distribution, warehousing, and delivery services. Therefore, according to this definition, logistics management includes the flow of goods and services and the information related to this flow, with the aim of things moving from suppliers to users with minimal waste. The broader underlying concept of integrated logistics management has also been portrayed as being able to bring higher customer service levels while decreasing distribution costs [21], which are cut by effectively managing the flow of products and by more efficient order processing, transportation, inventory, and warehousing [2]. A diagrammatic representation of this concept is offered in Fig. 1:\n\n",

We also consider these five elements in building our prototype system.\nHuman Resources: Well-trained experts who are capable of planning, coordinating, and estimating are important assets in crisis management. The CDC\u2019s expert experience and working skills under pressure would be helpful to better prepare for influenza outbreaks.Knowledge management: Capturing, codifying, transferring and retaining the information about medical supplies distribution can be helpful in learning about past cases of disease spread. Information transparency is also a crucial part of effective knowledge management.Process management: Logistics management plays a central role in influenza preparation and in meeting the demands in each area that is affected by the disease.Resources: At the influenza outbreak stage, emergency medical supplies must be flown into the disaster area from other areas, or even from abroad, as quickly as possible, despite the high costs. Taiwan\u2019s Communicable Disease Control act provides the government with the authority to execute resource sharing in such cases.Community: A central repository for reporting and disseminating XML-formatted messages can give an effective platform for collaborating among government, CDC, hospitals, and clinics.\n",

The CDC experts can adopt different distributions of medical supplies in accordance with the current influenza response requirements. The CDC can then make distribution decisions to meet the requirements of every region. If the CDC modifies the influenza preparation plan, the parameter values can be adjusted to meet the new system targets. Therefore, this architecture is a flexible and expandable influenza treatment mechanism.The web-based system provides a linking channel made available by using a dedicated line. System users can update the disease reports and input their assessment values at any moment and from any location.

However, the feasibility and practicability of the system could be further verified through in-depth case studies.While the medical supplies and parameters listed in Fig. 7 are sufficient for the purposes of this study, they do not incorporate all of those that would be required in a real outbreak situation.For simplification, the membership functions are distributed by triangular fuzzy numbers, and the importance weight of each region is considered equal. However, various membership functions could perhaps be estimated in accordance with different situations in future work.The system prototype focused on the notification and material allocation during an influenza pandemic, and no attention was given to other diseases, such as tuberculosis or hepatitis. Future research should thus be conducted into material distribution plans for other various infectious diseases.Finally, with the increasing threat of pandemic influenza and other diseases, future work can employ a CBR (case base reasoning) technique with this system. CBR has the capability of autonomous learning and resolution of cases by means of continuously enriching the CB (case base), and these accrued cases can be useful in providing more comprehensive assessments for the handling of serious outbreaks of infectious diseases.\n",
