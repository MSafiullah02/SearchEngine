PDCoV was first reported in pigs in Hong Kong in 2012 (Woo et al., 2017) and was subsequently detected in swine herds in the United States and isolated from clinical cases of diarrhea in young pigs in 2014 (Hu et al., 2015; Marthaler et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014). To date, PDCoV has been successively detected in Canada (Marthaler et al., 2014), South Korea (Lee and Lee, 2014), Mainland China (Wang et al., 2015), Mexico (Lee, 2015), Thailand (Janetanakit et al., 2016; Madapong et al., 2016), Vietnam and Lao PDR (Saeng-Chuto et al., 2017). Hence, PDCoV has recently become prevalent in pigs worldwide and has caused serious economic losses for the pig industry.",

ORF1a/b encodes two overlapping viral replicase polyproteins that are processed into mature nonstructural proteins. Although the general characteristics of the structural and nonstructural proteins of PDCoV are similar to those of other swine coronaviruses, the detailed functions and roles of the structural and nonstructural PDCoV proteins in host cells are largely unknown (Jung et al., 2016). Among these structural proteins, the N protein is known to be the most abundant and multifunctional viral component (Lee and Lee, 2015).",

However, compared with those of other swine coronaviruses, such as porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), the clinical symptoms of PDCoV infection are milder and the mortality rates are lower in affected nursing pigs (Chen et al., 2015; Jung et al., 2016; Zhang, 2016). Previous reports have shown that PDCoV mortality rates range from 40% to more than 80% among neonatal pigs (2014; Song et al., 2015). Similar to that of PEDV and TGEV, the strongest tissue tropism of PDCoV is in villous enterocytes of the small and large intestines, leading to marked villous atrophy in the small intestine but not in the large intestine (Chen et al., 2015; Hu et al., 2015; Jung et al., 2016).",

In addition, the porcine enterocyte cell line, IPEC-J2, is also susceptible to PDCoV infection but apoptosis may not be induced in the infected cells (Jung et al., 2018). As is the case for PEDV, trypsin contributes to a significant increase in PDCoV growth after several passages in LLC-PK cells, but not in ST cells (Hu et al., 2015). In addition, PDCoV can also be propagated in LLC-PK cells without supplemental trypsin; however, it does not produce cytopathic effects (CPEs) and the viral titer is reduced (Hu et al., 2015; Jung et al., 2016). Therefore, in general, LLC-PK and ST cells are suitable for the in vitro isolation and propagation of PDCoV field strains under optimal cell culture conditions.",

Additionally, the recent study shows that the Chinese PDCoV strains isolated from China had the same discontinuous amino acid deletions in Nsp2 and Nsp3 regions as Thailand, Vietnam and Laos, indicating that PDCoV may have undergone a high degree of variation since PDCoV was first detected in China (Sun et al., 2020). All of these studies show that the persistent occurrences of PDCoV infection in Asia and North America implies a potential risk of pandemic outbreaks. Therefore, effective vaccines are required to control and limit the spread of PDCoV. However, there are currently no vaccines available for PDCoV. Therefore, the main purpose of the present study was to isolate and serially propagate a PDCoV strain and to develop a vaccine candidate that can elicit a potent humoral immune response against PDCoV and effectively protect pigs against PDCoV infection. In this study, the PDCoV strain, CH/XJYN/2016 (GenBank No: MN064712), was successfully isolated and serially propagated using LLC-PK, and its biological characteristics and pathogenicity were determined. Notably, the infectious titer (the median pig diarrhea dose, PDD50) of PDCoV in conventional weaned pigs was determined for the first time. In addition, the immunoprotective effect of the cell-adapted strain CH/XJYN/2016-based inactivated vaccine candidate was evaluated. The results presented in this study indicated that the inactivated vaccine is a promising vaccine candidate for the prevention and control of PDCoV in China.",

The samples were stored at a low temperature with dry ice after collection. Subsequently, the samples were diluted 1:10 with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM, Invitrogen, USA) containing 1% penicillin-streptomycin (10,000 units/mL penicillin and 10,000 \u00b5g/mL streptomycin; Gibco, USA) and then centrifuged at 1500\u00d7g at 4 \u00b0C for 30 min. The supernatant was filtered using a 0.22-\u03bcm pore-size filter (Merck Millipore, Germany) to remove bacteria, and then the viral RNA was extracted using an RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to the operating instructions. The virus isolated from these samples was identified as PDCoV by N gene-based reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR; developed by our lab).

Piglets in the two experimental groups were immunized intramuscularly at 0 days postvaccination (dpv) with 2 mL of the prepared inactivated vaccines and were given two booster immunizations at 14 and 28 dpv. The mock control group received only PBS (n = 3). Blood samples were collected at 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42 dpv for antibody detection. All of pigs in three groups were challenged orally with 3 mL of 1000 PDD50 cell cultured CH/XJYN/2016-P6 at 42 dpv. After challenge, typical clinical symptoms of PDCoV infection were observed daily until 7 dpi, and scores of fecal consistency were rated according to our previous study (Liu et al., 2019). Samples of the intestinal faeces were collected daily to monitor viral shedding. Pigs will be identified as PDCoV infection-positive when the scores of fecal consistency were \u2265 2 and virus shedding could be detected in fecal samples at the same time.",

At necropsy, typical macroscopic intestinal lesions were found, especially in the small intestine (Fig. 3b). In detail, the intestinal tract was distended, transparent, filled with yellow fluid, and mesenteric congestion was present (Fig. 3b). Further histopathological examination of all the pigs from the infection group showed viral enteritis, such as vacuolar degeneration in the enterocytes and shortening, fusion and sloughing of the villi (Fig. 3c and d).

During the 7 dpi, obvious clinical symptoms, including watery diarrhea, vomiting, weight loss and depression, were observed in pigs from G1 and G2 (original and 10-1 diluted P6 virus), whereas none of the pigs in G3-G5 developed diarrhea, and all of their rectal swab samples were negative for PDCoV (Table 1). By 7 dpi, viral RNA fecal shedding in rectal swab samples became positive in G1 and G2 pigs, with cycle threshold (CT) values ranging from 13.43 to 28.78 (Table 1). Hence, based on the clinical observation and viral RNA fecal shedding results, 100% (5/5) of pigs in G1 and G2 and no pigs (0/5) in G3, G4 and G5 (Table 1) were infected. The cutoff time point was set as 7 dpi for determination of the PDD50, which was 2.0 log10PDD50/3 mL, equivalent to 100 TCID50.

Like those of PEDV and TGEV, PDCoV infections cause similar severe clinical disease and lesions, but the lack of an effective preventive vaccine for PDCoV has impeded the prevention and control of PDCoV in pig farms. Notably, reported data suggest that PDCoV has existed in mainland China for at least 11 years (Dong et al., 2015) and results in an increased mortality rate (more than 80%) among suckling piglets (Song et al., 2015). In addition, because PDCoV is an emerging virus, the lack of a comprehensive understanding of the pathogenic characteristics of have PDCoV also deterred the development of prevention and control methods (Jung et al., 2016). Therefore, the infectious titer (PDD50) of PDCoV in two-month-old conventional pigs and the protection efficacity of an inactivated vaccine based on the cell-adapted strain CH/XJYN/2016 were determined for the first time in the present study. This information will be helpful for future pig infection experiments and vaccine studies.",

The PDCoV strain CH/XJYN/2016 in this study is a field strain that was isolated in early 2016 in Northwest China. Phylogenetic analyses based on the full-length S gene demonstrated that the CH/XJYN/2016 strain clusters with other PDCoV strains isolated from China, the United States, Japan and South Korea. However, compared with those of the other reported Chinese strains, the genetic distances of the CH/XJYN/2016 strain are closer to the original Hong Kong strain HKU15-44 (JQ065042) (Woo et al., 2012), sharing 98.74% nucleotide identity. The sequence information of PDCoV strain CH/XJYN/2016 will contribute to the genetic and evolutionary characterization of PDCoV in China.",

First, as we mentioned in results, the obvious CPEs of the CH/XJYN/2016 strain were first observed at the fifth passage at 36 h postinoculation (hpi). Therefore, in order to obtain enough virus stocks for next challenge study, the passage P6 was chosen. Second, in general, virus stocks for challenge study needs the passage as low as possible. Because the pathogenicity of the viruses will decrease with the passage numbers increases. Besides, the cell culture-adapted CH/XJYN/2016-P30 was used for activated vaccine is because it keeps the greatest of the antigen concentrations and the lowest of passage at same time.",

Compared to that in 4-day-old neonatal piglets, the virus incubation period, time to shedding of fecal viral RNA and clinical disease onset (3-4 dpi) was increased in two-month-old pigs.

In China, inactivated vaccines have been routinely used for PED. PDCoV infections, which have similar clinical symptoms as those of PEDV and TGEV, can also be prevented and controlled using inactivated vaccines. To provide a vaccine that could be used to control PDCoV transmission, we developed an inactivated vaccine based on the cell-adapted strain CH/XJYN/2016.

Further animal challenge studies showed that the two inactivated vaccines both fully protected the pigs against 1000 PDD50 PDCoV infection; the pigs showed no obvious diarrhea, and no viral shedding was detected during the 7 dpi follow-up period.
