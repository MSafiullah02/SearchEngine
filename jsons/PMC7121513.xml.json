The sequencing of the human genome (3) furnished an unprecedented understanding of its structure and organization, but could not in itself account for human biological variation. To address the latter, a number of international consortiums or private corporations, such as the International SNP Map Working Group, SeattleSNPs PGA, and the Perlegen consortium, have multiplied efforts to resequence genes or genomic regions to characterize single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variations in the human genome (4\n\u2013\n6). To date, more than 11 million SNPs have been recorded in dbSNP, the public repository for DNA variation data (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/index.html) (see\nChapter 3 for details). Decorating the human genome at a frequency of one in every 500\u20131,000 bp, they are the most common form of human variation and can serve as high-resolution genetic markers. This variation, which represents a legacy of our evolutionary past and in the future may be a treasure trove of information paving the way to personalized medicine, may at least partially explain the wide range of phenotypic differences observed among individuals and populations (7\n\u2013\n9). These catalogues of sequence variation therefore provide scientists and clinicians with the precious raw material to be exploited in both human evolutionary studies and medically related research. Here the major challenges have been in devising and implementing cost-effective, easily accessible, and rapid molecular diagnostic methods that can interrogate anywhere from a few dozen to hundreds of thousands of polymorphisms. The comparison of these SNPs among large numbers of individuals can be used in therapy and drug design and even in devising new, more powerful approaches in cell-based screening approaches for drug discovery. It is these diverse and complicated needs that have driven the creation of high-throughput methods of SNP typing.",

            "text": "Once genome sequence diversity has been catalogued, the next step is to determine how this diversity is organized within the human genome. Eleven million SNPs discovered to date appear to be not entirely random. When a new mutation arises, it is associated with neighboring variants present on the same chromosome or haploid DNA molecule, forming what is commonly known as a \u201chaplotype.\u201d When two alleles lying on the same chromosome are always observed together, or at least more often than expected by chance, these two variants are said to be in linkage disequilibrium (LD). The HapMap project, a natural extension of the Human Genome Project, was a pioneer in describing empirically the patterns of SNP and haplotype variation in the human genome and in obtaining a general LD map in populations of different ethnic origins (10). HapMap data clearly demonstrate that the human genome is organized in a LD block-like structure and that these LD blocks are often disrupted by recombination hotspots (11, 12). When SNPs are in LD with each other, redundant information is contained within the haplotype (i.e., by knowing the marker at one locus, we can predict the marker that will occur at the linked loci nearby). Thus, when one infers haplotypes within a region of reasonable LD, the diversity of haplotypes is accounted for by a few common haplotypes and lots of rare ones. The common haplotypes will share a number of SNPs in common with each other, whereas the rarer haplotypes will be characterized by carrying the rarer alleles at certain loci. Thus, one can capture the majority of the diversity within a region by typing those SNPs which allow one to cover the most diversity; so-called tag SNPs.",

Importantly, tag SNPs defined on the basis of the HapMap populations have been shown to adequately capture patterns of variation in other human groups; tag SNPs are therefore highly \u201cportable\u201d (13\n\u2013\n15). In the practical sense, the HapMap data have already proven to be useful, as attested by the increasing number of successful genomewide association studies on diseases as diverse as type 1 (16, 17) and type 2 (16, 18, 19) diabetes, coronary artery disease (20), obesity-related traits (21, 22), rheumatoid arthritis (16, 23), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease progression (24). The portability and utility of tag SNPs opens up the possibility of their usage in \u201clower\u201d high-throughput methods that are cheaper to implement and broadly accessible. Indeed, with a wide range of relatively cheap and robust instruments (see\nTable\n17.1) and multiplexing probes such as molecular beacons, cost-effective high-throughput SNP typing becomes a reality (see\nFig.\n17.1).\n\n\n",

This can be overcome by use of differing nucleic acid amplification strategies, most notably polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This and other methods such as nucleic acid sequence based amplification allow the selective amplification and enrichment of a locus of interest by several-thousand-fold over other nucleic acid sequences present (25). The second obstacle is unambiguous detection of the SNP. Herein lies an intrinsic property of nucleic acid chemistry that can be exploited. A unique property of nucleic acid hybridization is its extremely high fidelity. Such molecular interactions are the most specific and stable known in nature. It becomes possible to monitor and detect hybridization of nucleic acids if it is accompanied by an assayable change in conformation. Two principal methods have emerged in detecting such assayable changes in conformation. The first, TaqMan (26), depends upon the monitoring of enzymatic nucleic acid probe cleavage, resulting in fluorescence (see\nChapters 18 and 19 for details). The second, molecular beacons (1), detects a conformational change in the probe, which fluoresces upon hybridization. We will focus principally on the use of molecular beacons.",

The loop is complementary to a known sequence in a target nucleic acid sequence, whereas the stem forms by the hybridization of the arm sequences on either side of the loop sequence. A fluorescent moiety is covalently linked to the extremity of one arm sequence and a quencher is covalently linked to the extremity of another arm. Thus, the fluorophore and quencher are directly juxtaposed when the stem is formed and are in extremely close proximity to each other. This association prevents fluorescence from being emitted from the fluorophore. When the loop portion of the molecule encounters a perfectly complementary target, the entire molecule undergoes a conformational change that results in the separation of the arms of the stem. This causes a restoration of fluorescence to the fluorophore as it is moved away from the quencher. Alterations to the length of the probe region strongly influence the stability and specificity of the probe\u2013target hybrid, contributing to the extreme specificity of molecular beacons. A wide variety of differently colored fluorophores are possible with molecular beacons (27), thus enabling the simultaneous detection of multiple targets in the same solution by using molecular beacons designed to detect differing targets each labeled with a spectrally distinguishable fluorophore.\n\n",

Molecular beacons are especially adept at the detection of SNPs since they recognize their targets with exquisite specificity unlike conventional linear probes, owing to their hairpin structure (37). Thermodynamic studies where linear and stem\u2013loop probes were compared have revealed that this enhanced specificity is a general feature of conformationally constrained probes such as molecular beacons. Thus, specificity can be \u201ctuned\u201d by altering the degree to which the probes are conformationally constrained. Practically this involves altering the length of the stem structure in relation to the length of the loop. In applications such as SNP detection, molecular beacons can be designed to bind over a wide range of temperatures such that only perfectly complementary probe\u2013target hybrids are formed. This keeps mismatched probes which vary by even as much as one base unbound and dark, whereas only perfectly complementary probe\u2013target hybrids elicit fluorescence. Owing to these unique properties, the use of molecular beacons for SNP detection has proliferated broadly as has its expansion into a cost-effective high-throughput SNP diagnostic tool.",

This is also true for quenchers. For complex syntheses and nonstandard molecular beacons, it is also possible to use manual coupling approaches. This is done by using oligonucleotides which contain either amino or sulfahydryl functional groups at either their 5\u2032-ends or their 3\u2032-ends. By using succinimidyl ester, iodoacetamide derivatives, or maleimide derivatives of the fluorophores and quenchers, one can couple most commercially available dyes and quenchers to oligonucleotides possessing either amino or sulfahydryl functional groups.

            "text": "The design of molecular beacons for SNP detection is at times challenging since the flexibility in the targeting region to be detected is virtually nil. The region where the SNP of interest occurs must be targeted and molecular beacons with as little as one base variant from this region must not bind under amplification conditions. To satisfy these constraints, the loop portion of the probe is made to be not more than 25 nucleotides in length. As a rule of thumb, the shorter the length of the loop, the more highly discriminating the probe will be. Care must be taken to ensure that the melting temperature of the probe\u2013target hybrid is compatible with the annealing temperature of primers during PCR. With this part of the design complete, stem/arm sequences can be designed that allow the stem to dissociate at about 7\u201310\u00b0C above the annealing temperature of the primers during PCR. This design process is made more complex in certain examples where multiple primers are used in a single tube (as in the example given later in this chapter). The challenge when doing multiplex PCR is to optimize all the primers for all the PCRs first. This ensures that all primers make good amplicons at the same temperature. Molecular beacons can then be designed to be SNP-discriminating at the annealing temperature of the primers by alterations in loop size. It is always useful to verify the secondary structure of the designed molecular beacon to ensure that it does not contain secondary structures that restrict the loop from binding to a PCR target. The preferred program for nucleic acid secondary structure prediction is Zuker/mfold fold (http://www.bioinfo.rpi.edu/applications/mfold/). For extremely difficult situations where design for AT- or GC-rich regions makes the stability of annealing variable, this can be circumvented by a number of strategies such as sliding the loop region so the SNP is no longer at its center. A second strategy is to include the stem/arm sequences in the binding sequence so as to create an even more stable hybrid (this could be useful in AT-rich regions). Lastly, if these strategies prove unsuccessful, an additional annealing step for the purposes of detection can be programmed into the thermal cycling profile. This step can be designed to occur at a temperature where it is easier to meet SNP discrimination constraints with the molecular beacons designed. It can also potentially result in false priming so it is not a preferred approach. For detailed instructions on the general design of molecular beacons for SNP detection, see (29,32).",

            "text": "DC-SIGN is an innate immunity gene that belongs to the C-type lectin family. C-type lectins are calcium-dependent carbohydrate-binding proteins with a wide range of biological functions, many of which are related to immunity (44). DC-SIGN as well as its homolog L-SIGN are particularly interesting, since they can act as both cell-adhesion receptors and pathogen-recognition receptors (45). DC-SIGN was originally cloned for its ability to bind and internalize the heavily glycosylated HIV gp120 protein (46). DC-SIGN strongly binds all HIV and simian immunodeficiency virus strains examined to date and plays an important role in virus adhesion to dendritic cells (47, 48). These studies have paved the way for further investigations into interactions between DC-SIGN and other pathogens and it has now become clear that this lectin recognizes a vast range of microbes, some of which are of major public health importance (48). Indeed, DC-SIGN captures bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium leprae, Helicobacter pylori, and certain Klebsiela pneumonia strains; viruses such as HIV-1, Ebola virus, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis C virus, Dengue virus, and SARS coronavirus; and parasites such as Leishmania pifanoi and Schistosoma mansoni (47, 49\n\u2013\n59).",

Ideally, one would need/like to fully resequence DC-SIGN in the entire cohort to obtain the full extent of diversity present in cases and controls. Nevertheless, full resequencing approaches are unacceptably expensive and time consuming and, therefore, the most powerful and cost-effective way to perform association studies is by defining tag SNPs for a region of interest (see\nSection 17.1 for details). To do so, you have two alternatives:Begin by fully resequencing the region under study in a subset of your cohort. Typically 20\u201330 individuals should be enough to capture the most common haplotypes in the population. After haplotype reconstruction (see\nNote 7) and on the basis of the LD patterns observed, you can then identify the set of SNPs best able to characterize the diversity observed (i.e., tag SNPs) (see\nNote 8).Use publicly available datasets to identify tag SNPs. The best available resource to choose tag SNPs is the HapMap data. Go to the HapMap Web site (http://www.hapmap.org) and using the genome browser retrieve genotypic data for all the SNPs that have been typed for the region you are interested in; in this case DC-SIGN. Then, upload the data in Haploview (a free software program provided by the HapMap consortium) and run Tagger to identify tag SNPs for your region (see\nNote 7). The current limitation of using HapMap is that the data are restricted to three human populations \u2013 the samples came from an African population from Nigeria (Yoruba; N = 90), a mostly Utah (USA) population of European ancestry (N = 90), and a sample drawn from Japanese (N = 45) and Han Chinese (N = 45) populations. If your population is genetically distinct from these HapMap populations, you will have to follow the resequencing strategy; as the tag SNPs identified using HapMap populations might differ from those characterizing the diversity of your study-population.\nOnce you have identified the set of SNPs best able to characterize the full diversity observed in your population, the next step is to genotype these tag SNPs in the entire cohort. In Fig.\n17.4 we present an example of a haplotyping approach scoring tag SNPs in a high-throughput assay using molecular beacons to easily test for an association between DC-SIGN variation and susceptibility to infectious diseases. This example is based on a previous study that explored the relationship between DC-SIGN polymorphisms and susceptibility to tuberculosis (63). The authors showed that nucleotide variation in the DC-SIGN promoter region is associated with susceptibility to tuberculosis. Specifically they identified a specific haplotype (Fig.\n17.4) associated with decreased risk of developing tuberculosis (63\n).\n\n",

Molecular beacons should be stored in aluminum-foil-wrapped test tubes at \u201320\u00b0C and preferably at \u201380\u00b0C in lyophilized form. When preparing them for use, one can resuspended them in TE buffer.Since most oligonucleotide manufacturers worldwide can provide molecular beacons with all these functionalities, obtaining molecular beacons with diverse fluorophore and quencher combinations has become routine. These suppliers can be found at http://www.molecular-beacons.org.At times, false amplicons may appear during PCR and may appear if the sensitivity of the PCR is reduced. Two approaches can be used to circumvent this. Firstly, DNA polymerases that are active only after activation at 95\u00b0C can be used. Secondly, paying careful attention to the design of primers that function well within the \u201cwindow of discrimination\u201d is recommended.The real-time PCR machines and fluorescent dyes proposed in Table\n17.1 and 17.2 are fairly good at discriminating between the proposed dyes. Thus, if poor discrimination is observed between major and minor alleles, tweaks to the primers and annealing temperatures can be made that permit more stringent discrimination. If these are unsuccessful, modifications to the molecular beacons themselves can be made. One modification is to increase the length of the molecular beacon stem to promote stability and increase stringency. A second modification is to use 2\u2032-O-methyl molecular beacons, which intrinsically have a higher melting temperature than DNA-based molecular beacons. However 2\u2032-O-methyl molecular beacons are more expensive to synthesize. Third, the stem sequence of the molecular beacon can be designed to also bind to the amplicon.Amplicon size has a very important influence on the fluorescence signal obtained with molecular beacons. Thus, it is important to design PCRs where amplicons do not exceed 250 bp.It is important that the groups of cases and controls are genetically matched, as population stratification between cases and controls can be a confounding factor leading to a spurious positive association. This will be particularly harmful if cases and controls are from different populations, but also in admixed populations (e.g. CAP population from South Africa). Indeed, the use of admixed populations in association-mapping studies can be very useful for identification of disease-causing genetic variants that differ in frequency across parental populations. However, when the admixture event is too recent, allelic frequencies can differ coincidentally among cases and controls, reflecting a nonuniform genetic contribution from the parental populations to each subpopulation (i.e., cases and controls), rather than a genuine association between a given genetic variant and the phenotype under study. In this case, the study cohort is said to present population stratification.To reconstruct haplotypes we recommend the Bayesian statistical method implemented in Phase version 2.1.162 (64). Alternatively, you can use the accelerated expectation maximization algorithm implemented in Haploview version 3.163 (65). At least for regions with high levels of LD, both algorithms should give similar results.Tag SNPsfor each population can be selected using Haploview\u2019s Tagger in pairwise tagging mode (r2 \u2265 0.80, minor allele frequency cutoff 5%, and other settings at default value).\n",

(a) Eighteen molecular beacons and corresponding primers were designed to score the major and minor alleles of nine \u201ctag\u201d SNPs of the DC-SIGN locus. Each major and minor SNP allele had a molecular beacon labeled in a spectrally distinct color. This means that in instruments where up to six colors are spectrally distinguishable, it is possible to simultaneously detect up to six major and/or minor alleles. To score each of the alleles in a given individual, three PCR amplifications were set up with the appropriate primers (not shown) that all annealed at a similar temperature. At each annealing step, depending on the presence or absence of a particular allele, a given molecular beacon would fluoresce. By \u201cscoring\u201d the data for each tube, one can determine, for each individual the specific genotype for each of the nine tag SNPs.
