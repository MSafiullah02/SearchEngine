This results in postsinusoidal portal hypertension and generates a triad of clinical signs: abdominal pain, hepatomegaly and high protein modified transudate ascites (Grooters and Smeak 1995) . BCLS is most commonly reported as a result of obstruction at the level of the right atrium or caudal vena cava (Table 1) . There is only one previous report of BCLS due to obstruction at the level of the hepatic veins (Cohn and others 1991) , and this occurred in a dog. In the cat, BCLS has been previously reported in only two cases, both of which had membranous obstruction of the caudal vena cava (Macintire and others 1995, Haskal and others 1999) .",

The intrahepatic section of the caudal vena cava measured 0\u00b745 cm in diameter, the portal vein measured 0\u00b762 cm in diameter at the porta hepatis, and the hepatic veins were not clearly visualised. The portal vein demonstrated a maximum flow rate of 21 cm/second (normal 10 to 12 cm/second), which was non-pulsatile (Lamb 1998) . A vessel demonstrating retrograde venous flow of 24 cm/second was identified in close proximity to the portal vein just before it entered the liver, and was thought to represent an extrahepatic shunting vessel. The branches of the portal vein within the liver were prominent but no abnormal intrahepatic blood vessels were identified.",

The most common causes of modified transudate abdominal effusions in small animals are right-sided congestive heart failure, cardiac tamponade, primary hepatic disease and postsinusoidal venous outflow obstruc-tion. A high protein (>25 g/litre), low cellular fluid is characteristic of chronic postsinusoidal venous obstruction (Johnston 1987a,b) . In this case, echocardiography and thoracic radiography excluded right-sided congestive heart failure and cardiac tamponade. Primary hepatic disease remained a differential diagnosis. However, high protein modified transudate ascites is uncommon in primary liver disease. A tentative diagnosis of postsinusoidal venous outflow obstruction was made. Splenomegaly remained unexplained.",

The left kidney was identified but was hypoplastic \u202b1\u05df5\u00b71\u05df2(\u202c cm) and a mesh of extrahepatic vessels was observed which was thought to represent extrahepatic portosystemic shunts. Histopathologically, the biopsies showed the liver to be congested with distinct perivenular fibrosis around the central (Fig 1) and sublobular veins. The splenomegaly was largely due to the presence of histiocytes in the red pulp (Fig 2) ; the white pulp was also expanded, but to a lesser degree. The histiocytic cells had ovoid or slightly indented open nuclei with prominent nucleoli. Their cytoplasm was abundant with poorly defined borders and mitotic figures were plentiful. The cells were negative for iron by the Perl's reaction but stained positively using a monoclonal mouse antibody, Mac 387 (Dako, A/S, Denmark), which is known to react with macrophages. The histopathological findings in the liver, together with a modified transudate in the abdomen, were consistent with a diagnosis of a BCLS, but the appearance of the spleen and the microcytic anaemia were confusing. The histiocytic reaction in the spleen raised the possibility of a malignant histiocytosis, which in some way could have caused pressure on the hepatic vein or induced hepatic fibrosis through inflammatory mediator release (Center 1999) . This complex and provisional diagnosis was discussed in full with the owner who declined further treatment for the cat but requested a full postmortem examination. The cat was subsequently euthanased.",

Most veins had varying degrees of perivenular fibrosis that then radiated out towards the portal triads within the sinusoids (Fig 1) . There was concurrent loss of hepatocytes in the centilobular areas. Staining with Masson's trichrome technique highlighted the increase in collagen fibres found both subendothelially in the central veins and in the tunica media of the larger sublobular veins. Occasionally, strands of fibrous tissue spanned the lumen of some vessels to reduce the functional diameter. This increased resistance resulted in a serpentine tortuosity of the veins within the collagen matrix (Fig 3) . The outer capsule of the liver was thickened due to fibrosis and the mesothelial cells were plump and active. In some areas, the single layer of cells was folded back to form pseudoacini and tuftlike projections from the liver surface.",

The clinical signs include the triad of hepatomegaly, abdominal pain and high protein modified transudate abdominal effusion (Fine and others 1998) . Hepatic veins lack valves and so an increase in postsinusoidal venous pressure causes a direct increase in sinusoidal pressure. Hepatic sinusoids have large fenestrations compared to other capillaries and increased sinusoidal pressure causes leakage of high protein fluid into the space of Disse. If the capacity of hepatic lymphatic drainage is exceeded, this high protein fluid contributes to ascites (Johnston 1987a,b) .",

Central and sublobular veins were surrounded by fibroblasts and collagen deposits and zone 3 hepatocytes were atrophied. These lesions were considered to be similar in location to VOD in humans. However, the histopathological findings were too dissimilar to confirm this diagnosis and a diagnosis of idiopathic intrahepatic postsinusoidal venous obstruction was made. This is the first report of BCLS in a cat with a hepatic venous site of obstruction. The authors believe that the histopathological findings in this cat are sufficiently similar to those in humans with VOD to make the first reported diagnosis of VOD in a domestic cat.",

These authors conclude that gray scale and Doppler ultrasound findings cannot reliably diagnose VOD in pediatric bone marrow transplant recipients and that ultrasound does not currently replace clinical criteria as the gold standard for the diagnosis of VOD. Thus, the findings of raised portal blood velocity on a single occasion in this individual case may not be at odds with a diagnosis of VOD.

Malignant histiocytosis in the cat is reported to produce similar clinical signs of anorexia, lethargy, hepatomegaly and splenomegaly with anaemia (Kraje and others 2001) . Grossly, tan nodules are present in the affected organs, which may include spleen, bone marrow, lung, liver and brain. Cytologically, haemophagocytosis is common and the invading histiocytes can appear in clusters that destroy the normal architecture of the affected organ. In dogs, evaluation of haemophagocytic disorders by cytology highlights the difficulty of differentiating between benign and malignant conditions, due to a lack of consistent parameters attributable to either condition (Weiss 2001) . There is no mention of a reactive histocytosis without haemophagocytosis in the literature. In this case, neither the location nor the phagocytic properties of the histiocytes are consistent with a diagnosis of malignant histiocytosis, suggesting a reactive rather than a neoplastic source of the histiocytes. Whatever the cause, it is unlikely that these two concurrent rare disorders are unrelated. The fact that splenic vessels drain entirely into the hepatic portal system supports the possibility that inflammatory mediator release from the histiocytes could be responsible for the fibrosis in the liver.",

The only leucocyte abnormality was mild lymphopenia \u202b01\u05df237\u00b70(\u202c 9 / litre [1\u00b75 to 7\u00b70]). An automated platelet count proved unreliable as a result of platelet agglutination. Examination of a fresh blood smear revealed normal platelet numbers. No abnormalities of red cell morphology were observed. Serum biochemistry detected mild elevations in alanine aminotransferase (75 \u00b5/litre [0 to 35]) and aspartate aminotransferase (37 \u00b5/litre [0 to 30]). Pre-and postprandial bile acids were within reference ranges. Mild hyponatraemia (142 mmol/ litre [145 to 160]) and azotaemia (urea 26\u00b72 mmol/litre [2\u00b77 to 9\u00b72], creatinine 197 \u00b5mol/litre [91 to 180]) were also present.",
