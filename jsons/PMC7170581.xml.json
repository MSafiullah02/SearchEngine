It is a family of viruses that cause respiratory infections, which were first isolated in 1937 and designated coronaviruses, because they have a crown-like appearance under microscopy, in 1965(2). The types of coronavirus known to date are as follows: the alpha coronaviruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63; the beta coronaviruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1; SARS-CoV, which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS); MERS-CoV, which causes Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS); and SARS-CoV-2, a new coronavirus described in late 2019 after cases were reported in China(2), which causes the disease known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).",

Laboratory tests to identify the virus involve the use of real-time polymerase chain reaction techniques and partial or total sequencing of the viral genome. The collection of nasopharyngeal aspirate, combined (nasal and oral) swab samples, or samples of lower respiratory tract secretions (sputum, tracheal lavage fluid, or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) is recommended. To confirm the disease, it is necessary to perform molecular biology tests that detect viral RNA. Severe cases should be transferred to a referral hospital for isolation and treatment. Individuals with mild symptoms should be followed at the primary health care level and should be advised to selfisolate at home(1).",

The fever is persistent, in contrast with the progressive decline observed in cases of influenza(1,3). Fever may not be present in some cases, such as those occurring in patients that are very young, elderly, or immunocompromised, as well as in those that have used antipyretic medication(1). In children, the disease appears to be relatively rare and mild, only approximately 2.4% of all reported cases occurring in individuals under 19 years of age, of whom only 2.5% and 0.2% have developed severe or critical illness, respectively(1,3).",

Among patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, approximately 80% had mild to moderate disease, which includes cases with and without pneumonia; 13.8% had severe disease, which includes dyspnea, respiratory rate \u2265 30 breaths/min, peripheral oxygen saturation \u2264 93%, and arterial oxygen tension/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio < 300, with or without pulmonary infiltrate occupying more than 50% of the lung parenchyma in the first 24-48 h; and 6.1% had critical disease, which includes respiratory failure and septic shock, with or without multiple organ dysfunction/failure. Although asymptomatic infection has been reported, the proportion of truly asymptomatic cases is not well defined. The individuals most at risk of serious illness and death reportedly include people over 60 years of age, especially those with underlying conditions, such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer(1,3).",

The authors hypothesized that the frequency of certain CT findings would increase in parallel with an increase in the time elapsed since infection. Only the initial chest CT scans were evaluated. In 27 (22%) of the 121 patients, CT showed no changes. The remaining 94 (78%) patients had ground-glass opacities, areas of consolidation, or both. Of the 121 patients, 73 (60%) had bilateral lung disease. None of the 121 patients had thoracic lymph node disease, pulmonary cavitation, or pulmonary nodules, and only 1 patient (1%) had pleural effusion. The time from the onset of symptoms to the first CT scan was classified as early (0-2 days; 36 patients), intermediate (3-5 days; 33 patients), or late (6-12 days; 25 patients). The frequency of ground-glass opacities and areas of consolidation was considerably lower in the early-CT group than in the intermediate-CT group and late-CT group. Pulmonary opacities were seen in only 16 (44%) of the 36 early-CT group patients, compared with 30 (91%) of the 33 intermediate-CT group patients and 24 (96%) of the 25 late-CT group patients. Bilateral pulmonary involvement was observed in 10 (28%) of the early-CT group patients, in 25 (76%) of the intermediate-CT group patients, and in 22 (88%) of the late-CT group patients. Linear opacities, a crazy-paving pattern, and the inverted halo sign were absent in the early-CT group but were present in the late-CT group in 5 (20%), 5 (20%), and 1 (4%) of patients, respectively. In terms of disease distribution in the axial plane, peripheral distribution was observed in 8 (22%) of the early-CT group patients, in 21 (64%) of the intermediate-CT group patients, and in 18 (72%) of the late-CT group patients.",
