First, BW development and production capabilities can be concealed at ostensibly legitimate industrial sites, such as vaccine plants or facilities for the production of single-cell protein or biopesticide. Second, the equipment and know-how needed for the manufacture of BW agents is entirely dual-use, although technologies for weaponization and delivery are more specialized. Third, because only tens of kilograms of an agent such as dried anthrax spores can be militarily significant, even small-scale production facilities are relevant from a security standpoint. Fourth, proliferant states often use deception and denial techniques to conceal their BW-related activities, as was demonstrated by the cat-and-mouse game played by Iraq and United Nations biological weapons inspectors after the 1991 Persian Gulf War. Finally, since the terrorist attacks in the United States on September 11, 2001, and the subsequent mailing of letters contaminated with anthrax bacterial spores, the biodefence programmes of several countries have expanded dramatically, providing a potential cover for offensive BW development.",

Most of the microbial pathogens that states have developed in the past as BW agents are zoonotic bacteria and viruses that infect humans as well as animals but are not transmissible from person to person; examples include the causative agents of anthrax, tularemia, Q fever, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis. Such non-contagious agents are best suited for targeted military use because only troops directly exposed to the agent cloud would be affected. During the Cold War, however, the Soviet Union developed two contagious agents (the smallpox virus and the plague bacterium) as strategic biological weapons for attacks on U.S. cities. Soviet military planners apparently assumed that the delivery of these agents against distant targets in the United States would trigger local epidemics that would not spread widely enough to boomerang against the Soviet population [1].",

The global spread of the biotechnology industry has complicated the task of regulating the international trade in items of biological production equipment, such as fermenters and spray-driers, increasing the risk of their diversion and misuse for bioweapons production. Despite the existence of the Australia Group, an informal forum of more than 40 countries that harmonize their national export controls on dual-use materials and equipment relevant to chemical and biological weapons, suppliers in countries that do not participate in the Australia Group (such as China, Cuba, India, and Russia) have sold dual-use items to countries of BW proliferation concern.",

With the advent of flexible biological manufacturing systems that can switch rapidly from one product to another in response to shifts in market demand, dedicated factories are no longer required for the production of BW agents. Instead, it has become possible for countries to acquire and maintain a standby mobilization capacity for biological weapons production at dual-use facilities without overtly violating the BWC. A would-be cheater could perform the research, development, and testing for an offensive BW programme in secret and then maintain a latent production capacity in distributed form at several locations until a political decision was made to break out of the BWC and acquire a weapons stockpile. At that time, key items of dual-use equipment, and the technical teams needed to operate them, could be brought together to initiate a BW production campaign. The short period\u2014measured in weeks\u2014required to manufacture a militarily significant stockpile might prevent an adversary from bolstering its medical defenses in a timely manner.",

The high-placed human sources needed to collect such information, however, are difficult to recruit. Latent proliferation also poses a major challenge for biological arms control. Because the BWC compliance of a dual-use production facility is largely a matter of intent, a state party would violate the treaty only when it started to produce biological agents \u201cof types and in quantities that have no justification for prophylactic, protective or other peaceful purposes.\u201d Given the difficulty of monitoring illicit production, it is far from certain that such a violation would be detected.",

One example is the growing convergence of biological and chemical production technologies [15]. Pharmaceutical companies now use genetically engineered bacteria and yeast to manufacture complex natural products of medicinal interest that are difficult or costly to extract from plant or animal sources. For example, the antimalarial drug artemisinin is currently purified from the sweet wormwood plant. In an attempt to increase the supply of the drug and lower its cost, scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, have used a technique known as \u201cmetabolic engineering.\u201d They isolated the set of genes coding for enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway of artemisinin from the sweet wormwood plant and inserted them into yeast cells, with the aim of producing an immediate precursor of the drug in large fermentation tanks [11]. In theory, a similar process might be used to mass-produce toxic natural substances such as saxitoxin, a potent paralytic poison made by marine algae that cause harmful blooms known as \u201cred tides.\u201d Although at present it is impractical to extract large quantities of saxitoxin from shellfish contaminated by a red tide, metabolic engineering might conceivably be used to mass-produce the toxin for BW purposes.",

Neuropeptides, a class of bioregulators in the central nervous system, are known to affect cognition and emotion. These compounds might therefore be developed into a new class of potent incapacitating agents with potential applications in law enforcement, counterinsurgency, and counterterrorist operations. If such biochemical agents prove to be tactically useful, countries might well be motivated to acquire and weaponize them, a development that would seriously undermine the biological and chemical disarmament regimes [14].",

Because smallpox eradication led countries around the world to stop vaccinating their civilian populations against the disease in the early 1980s, the human population has since become increasingly vulnerable to the deliberate use of smallpox as a biological weapon. Although the known stocks of the smallpox virus are currently held at two WHO-approved repositories in the United States and Russia, the CIA reportedly believes that undeclared cashes of the virus may exist in countries of BW proliferation concern, including Russia, Iran, and North Korea [5].",
