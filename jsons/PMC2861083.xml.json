Female and male mice, 2 to 4 months of age (18.0 to 22.0 g body weight), were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (60 \u03bcg/g). A closed-chest mouse model of reperfused myocardial infarction was used as previously described,11 to avoid the confounding effects of surgical trauma and inflammation, which may influence the baseline levels of chemokines and cytokines. The left anterior descending coronary artery was occluded for 1 hour then reperfused for 6 hours to 7 days. At the end of the experiment, the chest was opened and the heart was immediately excised, fixed in zinc-formalin, and embedded in paraffin for histological studies, or snap frozen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C for RNA isolation. Animals used for histology underwent 24-hour and 72-hour reperfusion protocols (nine animals per group). Mice used for RNA extraction underwent six hours (wild-type, n = 8; KO, n = 8), or 24 hours of reperfusion (wild-type, n = 9; KO, n = 10), whereas mice used for assessment of MMP activity were killed after 72 hours of reperfusion (wild-type, n = 8; KO, n = 8). CCR5 KO and wild-type mice used for flow cytometric analysis of the mononuclear cell infiltrate (n = 6 per group) underwent 24 hours of reperfusion. Additional animals were used for perfusion-fixation after 7 days of reperfusion (n = 12 per group) to assess remodeling-associated parameters.",

CXC chemokines containing the ELR motif play an important role in recruitment of neutrophils,20 whereas the CC chemokine MCP-1/CCL2 is critically involved in infiltration of the infarct with monocytes.9 Disruption of the MCP-1/CCR2 axis results in attenuated inflammation and reduced adverse remodeling,9 possibly by preventing infiltration with proteolytic and proinflammatory CCR2+ monocytes.5 We present the first evidence suggesting that a chemokine-mediated pathway may play a role in suppression of the postinfarction inflammatory response. Our study demonstrates that, in contrast to animals with CCR1 or CCR2 disruption, CCR5-null mice exhibit worse adverse remodeling associated with enhanced inflammatory activity after myocardial infarction. CCR5 absence resulted in impairment of the endogenous mechanisms involved in suppression of postinfarction inflammation, markedly reducing infiltration of the infarct with suppressive Tregs. Defective control of inflammation was associated with increased proinflammatory cytokine expression (Figure 3), shifting the balance of MMP:TIMP expression toward enhanced matrix degradation, increasing MMP activity, and leading to accentuated adverse remodeling (Figure 7).",

CCR5-null mice displayed accentuated pulmonary inflammation and increased mortality on infection with influenza A virus21 and had an enhanced delayed type hypersensitivity reaction suggesting a role for CCR5 in downmodulating T cell\u2013dependent immune responses.22 In addition, CCR5\u2212/\u2212 animals developed an exacerbated form of crescentic glomerulonephritis associated with increased mortality and enhanced recruitment of T cells and monocytes.23 Absence of CCR5 was also associated with the induction of CD8+ T cell\u2013mediated immunopathology leading to marked hepatic steatosis in viral hepatic inflammation.24 In contrast, other investigations suggested that CCR5 signaling may enhance inflammatory activity. CCR5-deficient animals exhibited reduced macrophage infiltration in the brain after infection with neurotropic coronavirus.25 Huffnagle et al showed that CCR5\u2212/\u2212 mice have defects in macrophage infiltration in the brain, but not in the lung, on infection with Cryptococcus neoformans,26 suggesting that CCR5 may have organ-specific defects in leukocyte trafficking. Our study demonstrates that although CCR5 does not play a crucial role in monocyte recruitment in the infarcted myocardium, its absence is associated with markedly enhanced proinflammatory cytokine expression through impaired recruitment of leukocyte subsets with suppressive properties.",

To address this question, we first examined whether CCR5 mediates infiltration of the infarct with monocyte subsets that possess anti-inflammatory properties. Nahrendorf and coworkers have recently demonstrated that mouse myocardial infarcts are sequentially infiltrated by two distinct monocyte subpopulations.5 Ly-6C hi monocytes are recruited during the inflammatory phase of healing; these cells express CCR2 and exert potent phagocytic and proteolytic effects secreting large amounts of cytokines. Ly-6C lo/CCR2-negative monocytes, on the other hand, infiltrate the myocardium during the reparative phase and promote healing by stimulating myofibroblast accumulation and angiogenesis.5 In wild-type mice we identified a sizeable population of CCR5-expressing cells that infiltrate the infarcted myocardium accounting for almost 40% of the CD45+ hematopoietic cells in the infarct (Figure 4). This CCR5+ subpopulation of mononuclear cells exhibited increased expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in comparison with the CCR5\u2212 subset (Figure 5). In addition, CCR5 gene disruption resulted in markedly enhanced upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines in the infarcted myocardium (Figure 3) associated with reduced expression of inhibitory cytokines in mononuclear cells isolated from the infarct (Figure 5). Thus, CCR5 expression appears to identify mononuclear cell subsets with anti-inflammatory properties.",

            "text": "Because inflammatory responses are often orchestrated by migration of T cell subsets,4 we focused our attention on the potential effects of CCR5 deficiency on infiltration of the infarcted myocardium with T lymphocytes. Several lines of evidence suggest that CCR5 may regulate immune responses by mediating recruitment of Tregs, a CD4+ subpopulation of T cells with an essential role in immunological homeostasis and self-tolerance.27 CCR5 signaling was essential for homing of tumor-associated Tregs in a model of pancreatic cancer14 and was a key regulatory signal in migration of Tregs to the site of Paracoccidioides infection.28 In addition, the CCR5 axis is critically involved in Treg recruitment in chronic intestinal inflammation15 and directs homing of Tregs to Leishmania-infected dermal sites promoting long-term survival of the parasite in the immune host.29 Our experiments suggest that the anti-inflammatory actions of CCR5 signaling may be attributable to impaired recruitment of Tregs in the infarcted myocardium. Although the role of Tregs in restraining autoimmunity and in providing protection from the immune response to infection is well-documented, their involvement in tissue repair after ischemic injury has not been investigated. We identified a sizeable population of Tregs in the infarcted myocardium (Figure 4), as CD4+ cells expressing foxp3, a transcription factor restricted to Tregs and indispensable for their differentiation.30 Almost half of the CCR5+/CD4+ cells infiltrating the infarct were identified as foxp3-expressing Tregs, whereas the majority of CCR5\u2212/CD4+ T cells were foxp3-negative (Figure 4). Thus, in the population of CD4+ T cells infiltrating the infarct, CCR5 expression was preferentially found in Tregs. Two lines of evidence suggested a crucial role for CCR5 in recruitment of Tregs in the infarcted heart. First, foxp3 mRNA expression levels were markedly reduced in CCR5-null infarcts (Figure 6A). Second, CCR5 absence was associated with significantly lower numbers of foxp3+ T cells in the mononuclear infiltrate of the infarct (Figure 6). Reduced infiltration with Tregs appears to abrogate regulatory signals that suppress inflammation in the infarcted heart. The molecular pathways responsible for Treg-mediated suppression of the immunoinflammatory response remain unknown. Although in vitro studies have demonstrated that Treg-mediated suppression requires direct cell contact, several in vivo investigations have suggested an essential role for secreted mediators, such as IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2.31,32 Rubtsov and coworkers33 have recently demonstrated that, although Treg-derived IL-10 synthesis was not required to prevent systemic autoimmunity, it was essential for protection from localized immune responses at environmental interfaces. Although the mechanisms involved in mediating the anti-inflammatory effects of Tregs in the healing infarct remain unknown, these cells may use multiple suppression mechanisms to control various aspects of inflammation.33",

Second, inflammatory mediators, such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, may enhance cardiomyocyte apoptosis in the remodeling myocardium.38 Third, proinflammatory cytokine signaling may suppress contractility accentuating ventricular systolic dysfunction.39 Our findings demonstrated that although accentuated inflammation in CCR5-null mice did not affect the size of the infarct (Figure 7E), it was associated with increased MMP expression and activity (Figure 7, H\u2013L). Thus, in the absence of CCR5 enhanced matrix degradation may result in adverse dilative remodeling of the infarcted ventricle.",

CCR5 signaling is an important molecular pathway controlling the postinfarction inflammatory response through the recruitment of Tregs. Infiltration of the infarct with regulatory T cells appears to provide essential inhibitory signals that prevent excessive inflammatory activity in the infarcted heart. Thus, pharmacological interventions or cell therapy enhancing the suppressive actions of Tregs after infarction may be promising new therapeutic strategies.",

Compared with wild-type (WT) (A), CCR5-null animals (B) exhibited accentuated dilative remodeling after 7 days of reperfusion. Quantitative morphometry (A, B, D, E, F) and echocardiography (C, G) were used to assess remodeling-associated parameters. Echocardiographic analysis demonstrated that LVEDD increased significantly after 7 days of reperfusion in both wild-type and CCR5-null mice (**P < 0.01 versus corresponding preinfarction values). CCR5-null hearts showed increased LVEDD (C) and LVEDV (D) after 7 days of reperfusion, suggesting accentuated dilative remodeling (***P < 0.05 versus corresponding wild-type). E: Increased dilative remodeling in CCR5-null infarcts was not attributable to a difference in the size of the infarct; scar size was comparable between wild-type and CCR5-null mice after 7 days of reperfusion. F: A trend toward increased LV mass was noted in CCR5 KO mice after 7 days of reperfusion (P = 0.08), suggesting enhanced hypertrophic remodeling. G: FS significantly decreased in both wild-type and CCR5\u2212/\u2212 mice after 7 days of reperfusion (**P < 0.01 versus corresponding preinfarction values), indicating the development of systolic dysfunction following myocardial infarction. However, the difference in fractional shortening between wild-type and CCR5 KO animals did not reach statistical significance (n = 12 mice/group). H: CCR5 KO mice had significantly higher MMP-8 and MMP-9 mRNA levels than wild-type animals after 24 hours of reperfusion (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 versus wild-type). In contrast, MMP-3 mRNA expression was comparable between groups. I: There was a trend toward increased MMP-2 mRNA expression in infarcted CCR5 KO hearts (P = 0.20). TIMP-1 mRNA levels, on the other hand, were significantly lower in wild-type infarcts. J: The ratios MMP-2:TIMP1, MMP-3:TIMP-1, and MMP-9:TIMP-1 were significantly higher in CCR5 KO infarcts (**P < 0.01 versus corresponding wild-type), indicating that CCR5 absence was associated with increased expression of matrix-degrading proteases in the infarcted heart (wild-type n = 9 mice, KO n = 10 mice).

Two control wild-type hearts, four wild-type infarcts, and four CCR5-null infarcts are shown for comparison.
