Influenza A and B viruses are single stranded RNA envelope virus composed of 890\u20132,341 nucleic acids in eight segmented genomes. Presently, only the virus subtypes of H1N1 and H3N2 still spread from human to human. The viruses spread and replicate under the following conditions: (1) the viruses enter the human body and duplicate there; (2) the viruses cause diseases; and (3) the viruses can easily spread from person to person. The H1N1 influenza viruses replicate is within only respiratory epithelial cells. The virus entering into the cells causes complex pathological changes of the cells. The columnar epithelial cells stop the self-synthesis of cellular component proteins. Therefore, the cells die due to their lack of necessary cell component proteins.",

These particles cannot stay in the air, but spread the disease by contacts. The contacts can be direct skin contact or indirect respiratory secretions contact, the latter of which refers to touching his/her own eyes, nose or mouth with his/her own contaminated hands. The patients can spread the virus from 2 days prior to symptoms onset to fifth day after symptoms onset. The infection time of swine-origin influenza A virus (S-OIV) during its incubation period is about 2\u20137 days. According to data analysis, most patients infected by S-OIV may have their symptoms onset 1 day in advance, or 5\u20137 days after being infected. The infection period may be prolonged in immunocompromised children or patients with severe psychiatric disorders. It has been unknown whether a infected asymptomatic person is the source of infection, which deserves detailed research. Severe cases and death cases are mostly caused by the occurrence of its complications, including primary viral pneumonia and secondary bacterial pneumonia (especially group A \u00adstreptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae). Dyspnea, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organs failure are fatal clinical signs of Influenza A (H1N1). The average period from symptoms onset to death is about 9 days.",

            "text": "Influenza A (H1N1) virus is particularly prone to virus variation. Based on the studies about the variation of Influenza A (H1N1) virus, it has been believed that the new human pathogenic mutant has completed its genetic fragments combination in the animal body before its direct invasion into human body. The genetic segments studies of influenza virus from the influenza pandemic in the year of 1918 found genes similar to swine and bird flu viruses. Therefore, it is believed that the influenza A pandemic in 1918 was caused by the integration of human influenza virus to a segment of DNA from swine influenza virus to form H1N1 influenza virus that is affinitive to human body. Based on the belief, experts speculate that the gene recombination of the bird flu virus with human flu virus would cause global influenza pandemic. Other scholars also put forward the theory of twice crossing and the model of birds  \u2192  human  \u2192  swine. In this model, the bird flu viruses spreading in poultry animals cross the species boundary to infect other animals, such as pigs, horses, whales or sables. Following the first crossing, the viruses cross the species boundary again to infect human. Some scholars insist on the theory of viruses genes mixer, namely the well-known quick infection of both human flu viruses and bird flu viruses to swine, and swine acts as a viruses genes mixer (to recombinate virus strains from two different species). Therefore, the swine flu virus containing human flu virus gene emerges, which can proliferate in human body and spread from person to person. WHO recommends the real-time quantitative RT-PCR to detect seasonal flu, including seral A, B, H1 genes, proteins H3 and bird flu H5 virus. Using probes and primers to detect A-H1N1 flu virus, nucleotide sequence analysis and systematic culture analysis, the infection of human MDCK cells by Influenza A (H1N1) virus can be confirmed. After reverse transcribed amplification sequencing and following PCR amplification production, the overlapping double-stranded DNA in influenza virus genome can be amplified. Genome degradation and sequence variation of about every 200\u2013500 nucleotides cause prolonged existence of H1N1 influenza virus.",

The onset of Influenza A (H1N1) is acute, with its symptoms being similar to common influenza, including typical fever, general upset, muscular soreness and pain, sore throat, runny nose and cough, possible eye conjunctivitis, possible nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea. The cases with persistent high body temperature should be given focused attention. According to the clinical review on 18 cases of S-OIV infection treated in a Mexico hospital, S-OIV infection is a serious illness associated with death. Most patients were previously healthy and suffered from pneumonia from day 5 to 7 after the onset of flu-liked symptoms. In them, seven patients were hospitalized at the day of clinic visit suffering from acute pulmonary impairment or acute respiratory distress. Multiple organs failure occurred in all the seven cases. S-OIV infection commonly occurs in the elderly and children and the ages of more than half of the patients range from 13 to 47 years. The age distribution of S-OIV is similar to that of Mexico influenza epidemic in 1918. Research data of Influenza A (H1N1) indicates that a large number of death is related to bacterial infection. However, the 14 cases with complicated bacterial infections out of 18 cases in Mexico review had no serious outcomes, which may be related to the early use of antibiotics before hospitalization.",

Most cases may have decreased white blood cells counts, but occasionally the white blood cells count may increase due to the secondary bacterial infection. Lymphocyte count commonly decreases, with normal count of platelets. Bone marrow puncture shows active cells proliferation, reactive histiocytosis with accompanying hemorrhagic phagocytosis. Patients may have increased ALT. Throat swabs is negative to bacterial culture. The most reliable laboratory evidence is the increased dehydrogenase. Increased lactic dehydrogenase usually indicates myocarditis.",

It can also target on alveoli to cause diffusive fibrosis of the pulmonary tissues and alveolar impairments of congestion, edema, surface exudation of viscous liquid, foam liked exudates in small bronchi and bronchioles and large amount of mixed serofibrin in chest cavity. The pathological examinations of two death cases in Hong Kong showed that the reactive hemophagocytic syndrome is histologically prominent. Other pathological findings include diffusive alveolar impairments with accompanying fibrosis, extensive hepatic centrilobular necrosis, acute renal tubular necrosis, lymphocytes function failure and increased levels of soluble IL-2 receptor, IL-6, \u03b3-interferon. Therefore, it is believed that alveoli are the targets of Influenza A (H1N1) virus. It replicates in the respiratory tract and the high cytokines is produced by reactive hemophagocytic syndrome.

The abnormal demonstrations usually occur in lower lungs, with alveolar exudation and fusion into blurring cloudy shadows, blurred costophrenic angle. The condition may further pathologically progress into large flaky dense parenchymal shadows. Also in this report, CT scanning found early manifestations of thickened pulmonary markings and punctiform exudates in the right lower pulmonary segment, infused mist liked lobular infiltration. Along with the progression of the condition, large flaky parenchymal shadows in the right lower pulmonary segment was found with involvement of the lung periphery, blurry upper boundary of the diaphragm, the blunt costophrenic angle, increased and blurry bilateral hili. CT scanning of the right lower lung found dense parenchymal shadows, visible lung tissues containing gas shadows with blurry boundaries. After treatment, the foci can be quickly absorbed. Most mild cases have favorable prognosis and for some cases, the disease progresses rapidly. With progressive development of pneumonia, respiratory distress syndrome, respiration failure, heart failure, kidney failure and infectious shock may occur to cause death.",

The fever was irregular, with chills and headache. On the next day, runny nose occurred, with recurrent fever of higher body temperature afternoons and his temperatures above 38 \u00b0C. On Oct. 26th, 2009, throat upset occurred, with paroxysmal dry cough, no sore throat and hoarse voice. Dyspnea occurred last night, with accompanying continuous dull chest pain that was worse when lying down and relieved when sitting up. He also coughed, with a little rusty phlegm but no blood. He was clinically diagnosed as acute type I respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia complicating to critical Influenza A (H1N1).",
