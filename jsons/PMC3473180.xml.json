Cholera toxin is a hexameric AB5 protein consisting of one toxic 27 kDa A subunit having ADP ribosyl transferase activity and a non-toxic pentamer of 11.6 kDa B subunits that binds to the A subunit and facilitates its entry into the intestinal epithelial cells. When administered orally, CTB is a potent mucosal immunogen;13 this is believed to be a result of CTB binding to eukaryotic cell surfaces via GM1 ganglioside receptors present on the intestinal epithelial surface, eliciting a mucosal immune response to pathogens and enhancing the immune response when coupled chemically to other antigens.14, 15\n",

When the native LTB gene was expressed via the tobacco nuclear genome, LTB accumulated at levels less than 0.01% of the total soluble leaf protein.3 To improve LTB expression, a synthetic gene was created that contained plant-preferred codons and eliminated potential mRNA processing signals and destabilizing motifs found in the native gene.16 Using the native CTB gene for comparison, the synthetic gene increased antigen accumulation in leaves and tubers by threefold to 14-fold.7, 16 However, extensive codon modification of genes is laborious and expensive. One of the consequences of these constitutively expressed high LTB levels was the stunted growth of transgenic plants that was eventually overcome by tissue-specific expression in potato tubers.16 By altering the native CTB gene to code for a C-terminal SEKDEL sequence, which targets expression to the endoplasmic reticulum, CTB expression of up to 0.3% TSP was achieved in auxin-induced potato tissues via the nuclear genome.17\n",

The accumulation levels of the Bt Cry2Aa2 operon in tobacco chloroplasts were as high as 46.1% of the total soluble plant protein.23 Besides the ability to express polycistrons, another advantage of chloroplast transformation is the lack of recombinant protein expression in pollen of chloroplast transgenic plants.23 Absence of chloroplast DNA in the pollen of most crops reduces pollen-mediated outcross of transgenes.19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26 Also, stable incorporation of the CTB gene into spacer regions between functional genes of the chloroplast genome by homologous recombination eliminates the \u201cposition effect\u201d frequently observed in nuclear transgenic plants. Lack of gene silencing in chloroplasts should allow uniform expression levels in different transgenic lines. Integration of the transgene into chloroplast genomes should result in a high level of CTB gene expression, since each plant cell contains up to 10,000 copies of the plastid genome.27 Similar to the endoplasmic reticulum, the production of CTB in chloroplasts allows formation of disulfide bridges,21, 28, 29 which are necessary for the correct folding and assembly of the CTB pentamer.30\n",

The chimeric aminoglycoside 3\u2032 adenylyltransferase (aadA) gene, conferring resistance to spectinomycin and streptomycin, and the CTB gene downstream of it are driven by the constitutive promoter of the rRNA operon (Prrn), each with individual ribosome-binding sites (GGAGG), and the foreign transcripts are stabilized by the psbA3\u2032 untranslated region. Since the protein synthetic machinery of chloroplasts is similar to that of E. coli,33 CTB expression of the pLD-LH-CTB vector was initially tested in E. coli. Western blot analysis of sonicated E. coli cell extracts showed the presence of 11 kDa CTB monomers, similar to commercially available CTB (Figure 2(a)), when blots were probed with rabbit anti-cholera serum. Oligomeric expression of CTB was not observed in E. coli, as expected, due to the absence of a leader peptide sequence present in the native CTB gene that normally directs the CTB monomer into the periplasmic space allowing for concentration and oligomeric assembly. Inability of E. coli to form disulfide bridges in the cytosol is a major limitation in large-scale production of this antigen.",

Each transgenic clone was subjected to a second round of spectinomycin selection and putative chloroplast transformants were confirmed by PCR screening. Primers were designed to determine whether the integration of foreign genes had occurred in the chloroplast genome at the directed site by homologous recombination. The strategy employed was to land one primer (3P) on the native chloroplast genome adjacent to the point of integration and the second primer (3M) on the aadA gene (Figure 1(a)). The presence of the 1.65 kb PCR product in nine out of the ten putative transgenics screened, confirmed the site-specific integration of the gene cassette into the chloroplast genome (Figure 1(b)). The putative transgenic line 4 (lane 6) is a spontaneous mutant. Such mutations occur in the 16 S rRNA gene and confer high levels of spectinomycin resistance.34 Nuclear transformants resulting from integration of the aadA gene downstream of functional promoters do not confer high levels of spectinomycin resistance and are therefore eliminated in the selection process. To demonstrate the presence of the CTB gene in the transgenic lines 1\u20133 and 5\u201310, an additional PCR was performed using a primer (5P) that lands upstream of the CTB gene, on the aadA gene, and one (2M) that lands downstream of the CTB gene, on the trnA gene (Figure 1(c)). The presence of the 1.9 kb PCR product from all the transgenic lines analyzed verifies the expected integration of the CTB gene in tandem with the aadA gene.",

In unboiled samples, chloroplast-synthesized CTB appeared as oligomers (Figure 2(c), lane 4) similar to the unboiled, pentameric bacterial CTB, which appeared to have partially dissociated into tetramers, trimers and monomers upon storage at 4\u00b0C over a period of several months (Figure 2(c), lane 7). The absence of monomers in transgenic plant extracts suggests that unassembled monomers are proteolytically degraded. While heat treatment (four minutes, boiling), prior to SDS-PAGE, of pentameric bacterial CTB gave CTB monomeric and multimeric forms (Figure 2(c), lane 6), chloroplast-synthesized CTB dissociated into dimers, trimers and multimers when subjected to similar heat treatment (Figure 2(c), lanes 3 and 5). This is not due to inadequate boiling or low concentrations of dithiothreitol or \u03b2-mercaptoethanol. Increasing these agents to reduce disulfide bridges or increasing duration of boiling did not alter polypeptide profiles significantly. However, the same conditions were adequate to dissociate bacterial pentamers (Figure 2(c), lane 6). These results differ from the heat-induced dissociation of potato plant nuclear-synthesized CTB oligomers into monomers.17 A probable reason for this unusual stability could be a more stable conformation of chloroplast- synthesized CTB, which may be an added advantage in storage and administration of edible vaccines. Proteins larger than 55 kDa are aggregates of oligomers in plant extracts and purified bacterial antigen (Figure 2(c), lanes 4 and 7). Because of variations in the degree of aggregation, boiled samples did not show identical polypeptide profiles. Leaf homogenates from four different transgenic lines showed similar expression levels of CTB protein (Figure 2(b), lanes 3\u20136) due to lack of gene silencing or position effect that are usually observed in nuclear transgenic plants. This confirms that clonal variation of CTB expression is minimal among independent transgenic lines, as observed in ELISA quantification assays. Consistent expression levels of recombinant proteins in plants (as obtained for CTB in this research) may be essential for production of edible vaccines in plants.",

Aggregation of assembled pentamers (Figure 2(c), lane 4) in plant extracts similar to purified bacterial antigen (Figure 2(c), lane 7) should have resulted in underestimation of CTB in ELISA, where protein extracts were used directly without any treatment to dissociate aggregated CTB. This inference is supported by observation of very high levels of bacterial genes (up to 46% TSP) with similar AT content in transgenic chloroplasts.22, 23 Also, estimation of CTB expression levels from different stages of leaves (young, mature and old) determined that mature leaves have the highest levels of CTB protein expression. The top three or four leaves were designated as young; large, well-developed leaves collected from the middle of the plant were considered as mature; leaves that were generally bleached or undergoing scenescence, from the bottom of the plant were designated as old. This observation is in accordance with the results obtained when similar experiments were performed with the Bt Cry2aA2 gene, expressed as a single gene.23 However, when this gene was expressed with a putative chaperonin gene as the Cry2aA2 operon, high expression levels in older leaves were observed, probably due to the formation of stable crystalline structure.23\n",

The GM1 binding ability also suggests proper folding of CTB molecules resulting in the functional pentameric structure. Since oxidation of cysteine residues in the B subunits is a prerequisite for in vivo formation of CTB pentamers,30 proper folding is a further confirmation of the ability of chloroplasts to form disulfide bonds. The ratio of CTB expression in transgenic lines 3 (3.5%) and 7 (4.1%) in the CTB quantitative assay (Figure 5(a)) is proportional to the GM1 binding measured absorbance ratio of transgenic lines 3 (A = 1.2) and 7 (A = 1.4; Figure 5(b)). This observation indicates that the binding of CTB to GM1 is proportional to the level of synthesis in two different transgenic lines.",

            "text": "The potential use of the chloroplast technology developed in this study is threefold. It can be used for (1) large-scale production of purified CTB, (2) as an edible vaccine if expressed in an edible plant or (3) as a fusion transmucosal carrier peptide, to either enhance mucosal immunity or induce oral tolerance to the products of these peptides.14 Large-scale production of purified CTB in bacteria involves the use of expensive fermentation techniques and stringent purification protocols,35 making this a prohibitively expensive technology for developing countries. The cost of producing 1 kg of recombinant protein in transgenic crops has been estimated to be 50 times lower than the cost of producing the same amount by E. coli fermentation.36 If 5% of the alfalfa soluble protein were the target protein, one could harvest about 15 kg of the transgenic-expressed protein/acre per year.37 While existing expression levels of CTB via the chloroplast genome are adequate for commercial exploitation, levels could be increased further (up to 50% total soluble protein) by insertion of a putative chaperonin,23 which may also aid in the subsequent purification of recombinant CTB due to crystallization. If used as an edible vaccine, a selection scheme eliminating the use of antibiotic-resistance genes should be developed.38 One such scheme uses the betaine aldehyde dehydogenase (BADH) gene, which converts toxic betaine aldehyde to non-toxic glycine betaine, an osmoprotectant.39 Other strategies have been developed to eliminate antibiotic-resistance genes from transgenic plants.40 Development of edible vaccines in transgenic leaves are ideal for animal vaccines. Future development of edible vaccines for human consumption would be more appealing if the vaccines were expressed in edible parts of transgenic plants. Expression of a transgene in chromoplasts has been demonstrated,41, 42 and the efficiency of translation of foreign genes in chromoplasts is similar to that of chloroplasts.43 Therefore, we anticipate that elevated edible vaccine expression in chromoplasts of transgenic fruits is both feasible and forthcoming.",
