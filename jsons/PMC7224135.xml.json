Worldwide each year around 6.2 million people are exposed to TBI.

This elevated acute-phase response correlates with increased cell death and DNA damage, leading to more severe secondary injury processes after injury even with progesterone treatment. Both TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 are significantly increased in vitamin D deficiency and both cytokines demonstrate a strong correlation between deficiency and treatment [20]. A recent study showed that elevation in IL-6 was most evident when comparing vitamin D-deficient and vitamin D-normal animals after TBI and progesterone treatment. While most of the other cytokines were elevated in vitamin D-deficient animals two- or threefold, IL-6 was increased nearly fivefold by 72 h after injury, suggesting that IL-6 may be the primary cytokine involved in the detrimental effects of vitamin D deficiency after TBI [21]. Various aspects of vitamin D deficiency are presented in Fig. 1.",

The enrolled subjects were young (mean age 36.4 years, 71.4% male and female 28.6%) and all suffering TBI. The causes of TBI were as follows: road traffic accidents (62.9%), falls (22.9%) and assault (14.3%). All these patients were deficient in vitamin D levels. After treatment, there was a significant rise (p \u2264 0.001) in the level of vitamin D in the intervention group. Seven days after TBI, from day 2 to day 7, improvement in the GCS score was found to be higher in the vitamin D group (p \u2264 0.0001) compared to the control group. The mean GCS level increased by 3.86 units in the vitamin D group while having an average 0.19-unit deterioration in the control group. The overall duration of ICU stay and mechanical ventilation was lower in the vitamin D group (6.19 vs. 9.07 days) (Table 2). The GOSE (Glasgow Outcome Score Extended) score analysed after 14 days was found to be higher in the vitamin D group than in the control group. Cytokine (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IL-2, IFN-\u03b3) analysis showed that the median values showed a reduction of IL-6 (p = 0.08), TNF-\u03b1 (p = 0.02) and IL-2 \u03b1 (p = 0.36) and improved level of IFN-\u03b3 (p = 0.65) in the vitamin D group compared to the control group (Table 3). During the study, pre (at the time of admission) and post (14 days after the last lavage with vitamin D) haematological, biochemical (Table 4) and coagulation parameters (Table 5) were analysed to record any discrepancies. Coagulation parameter values were noted as normal or abnormal, for which normal values are presented in unit % in both the groups in Table 5. The prevalence of these potentially confounding factors was found to be satisfactory in both the groups (Tables 4 and 5).",
