Indeed, although clinical cases may often produce more infectious virus than inapparent infections, the latter are generally more numerous and, because these do not restrict the movement of infectious individuals, they can provide a major mechanism of viral dissemination. Epidemiologists recognize three different patterns of virus survival in mammalian hosts, distinguished through use of virus reservoirs: acute self-limiting infections with no reservoir, persistent infections with a reservoir in humans, and involvement of an animal reservoir.",

There are three distinct components of spread of respiratory viruses. Small-droplet aerosols (<10 \u03bcm diameter particles) can create rapid explosive outbreaks and spread to more distant contacts (>1.8 m). These particles are more likely to settle lower down the respiratory tract. Second, large-droplet aerosols (10 to 100 \u03bcm diameter) sink to the ground more quickly, and therefore transmission needs closer contact between source and recipient (<~0.9 m); spread may be slow, intermittent, and without clustering. These particles are mostly trapped in the upper airways. Third, spread occurs when fomites, including tissues, ward equipment, and household objects become contaminated with respiratory secretions or aerosol droplets and contacts transfer this material to their own respiratory tracts; this mode of spread particularly involves those in close contact with others under conditions of poor hygiene (Box 13.1\n).Box 13.1Transmission Routes via the Respiratory TractRespiratory transmission is a very efficient way to quickly infect a large number of contacts and spread virus globally (compare influenza with HIV). There are two mechanisms:1.\nInhalation of aerosol. Humans filter ~600 liters of air per hour when breathing at restAerosols are created especially by sneezing and coughing, less by talking.Large droplets (>10 \u03bcm) soon sink to the floor, while small droplets can spread further but dry out and virus becomes inactivated; this is why the atmosphere does not remain infective for longSeasonality of respiratory infections is affected by increased virus survival in cooler temperatures, seasonal differences in social activities, school attendance patterns, and many other factors2.\nContaminated objects. Infected respiratory secretions contaminate tissues, environmental surfaces and objects, hands. Shaking hands, handling objects etc. provides a pathway for virus to the nose and mouth of a new person\n",

Sexual transmission of virus infections by mucosal contact can be efficient because the virus is kept moist and does not need to survive long outside the body; however dissemination through risk populations by this route is usually slower than by respiratory spread because involvement of multiple contacts is usually slower. Studies particularly with HIV have shown that sexual transmission is enhanced when there is a greater number of consecutive partners, when concurrent genital mucosal tears or intercurrent infections (e.g., ulcerating STDs) are present, and when the male involved is not circumcised. The most important examples are HIV, HBV, human papillomavirus, and herpes simplex type 2, although other herpesviruses, hepatitis B, and HTLV I are also sexually transmitted with ease.",

Highly sensitive tests, for example polymerase chain reaction (PCR), are often used because of the extra risk caused by the large volume of blood transfused and the usual compromised health of recipients. Today in most countries, blood-borne transmission of these viruses is more a problem among intravenous drug users due to contaminated needles and injecting paraphernalia. Of course, blood is the usual source from which arthropods (e.g., mosquitoes, ticks, sandflies) acquire viruses during the course of taking a blood meal.

The complex usage of different receptors by different influenza variants can determine virus transmissibility between humans (see Chapter 25: Orthomyxoviruses). Enteric viruses are also shed in large numbers but usually for a longer period (a week or more) in feces. These viruses may contaminate hands, fomites, food, and water. Enveloped respiratory viruses are relatively labile, especially during summer or in the tropics year-round.

As a result, most people no longer had acquired immunity by the time they reached adolescence. For reasons still unknown, primary infection in older children and adults with poliovirus or hepatitis A is more likely to cause clinical disease, compared to infection at a young age. The consequence was a paradoxical increase in clinical disease following this improvement in living standards. This was exemplified most strikingly in \u201cvirgin soil\u201d epidemics occurring, long before the vaccination era, in isolated communities with no prior experience of the virus; most of the deaths occurred in adults.

Many of the rash diseases of childhood transmitted by the respiratory route reach a peak in the spring. Among the enteric virus infections, seasonality varies with the etiologic agents: the incidence of a number of enterovirus infections (in common with most enteric bacterial infections) is greatest in the summer, but caliciviruses show no regular seasonal patterns and rotaviruses tend to be more prevalent in the winter months. Infections with the herpesviruses (HSV, cytomegalovirus, and EB virus), all transmitted by intimate contact with saliva and other bodily secretions/excretions, show no seasonal variations in incidence; neither do other sexually transmitted diseases. The patterns shown in Table 13.5 are found in both the northern and southern hemispheres. Different factors probably affect seasonality in the tropics, where wet and dry seasons tend to replace summer and winter. The peak incidence of measles and chickenpox is late in the dry season, with an abrupt fall when the rainy season begins, whereas influenza and rhinovirus infections reach a peak during the rainy season.\n",

However in April 1951, a Greenlandic seaman traveled home from Copenhagen after being in contact with someone in the prodromal phase of infection. Unfortunately in his case the incubation period was unusually long (19 days before appearance of the rash, longer than the duration of the voyage), and second, while in the prodromal phase of infection he took part in a dancing festival involving several hundred people. The resulting epidemic infected all but 5 of the 4262 theoretically susceptible individuals in southern Greenland, with a mortality of 1.8% (greatest in those over 55 years of age) and encephalitis in slightly more than 1 in 1000.

Although the newborn population (the birth cohort) provides the input of susceptibles each year, the age distribution of cases in unvaccinated communities is primarily that of children just entering school, with a peak of secondary cases at about two years of age through family contacts.

In all cases the denominator (total number of persons at risk) may be general, that is the total population in a state or country, or it may be a specific cohort of individuals known to be susceptible or at risk. The latter is often equated with the number of persons in a specified population who lack antibodies to the virus of interest (\u201csusceptibles\u201d). In each situation it is imperative to be clear about the nature of the denominator.

It will be immediately apparent that two additional aspects are important. First, it is usually the case that not all members of a population are susceptible, for example because of prior infection leading to immunity. Thus, an incidence rate recorded in a total population may produce a lower figure than a more targeted incidence rate based on those who are truly susceptible. Second, with nearly all viruses, not all infected individuals develop clinical disease, and many infections go unrecognized. Thus the incidence rate of clinical disease is invariably lower than the incidence rate of total infections. The ratio of clinical to sub-clinical, or inapparent, infections varies widely between different viruses. For example, measles infections are almost always clinically apparent, whereas less than 1% of those infected with encephalitogenic arboviruses or with polioviruses develop encephalitis or poliomyelitis, respectively (Table 13.2).\n",

In most countries today, human subject research is highly regulated by governmental agencies; at the heart of review and oversight are local institutional review boards [IRBs, also known as independent ethics committees (IECs) and human subject committees (HSCs)]. It is essential in such oversight that short- and long-term risks be carefully assessed, including the possibility of transferring adventitious agents present in an inoculum as a contaminant; subjects may need to be isolated for the duration of such studies, thus reducing the risk of secondary transmission to contacts.Box 13.6Transmission of Hepatitis VirusesOne notable study of hepatitis viruses was carried out by Saul Krugman and Joan Giles among children with intellectual disabilities in the Willowbrook State School on Staten Island in New York. Hepatitis infections were endemic in the 1960s among the institutionalized children despite all medical and nursing measures to prevent transmission. Krugman and Giles studied these infections, isolated two prototype infective sera that we now recognize contained hepatitis A and B respectively. Their work represented pioneering advances including defining the clinical characteristics of HAV and HBV infections, demonstrating that there were two distinct agents with no cross-protection, and ultimately demonstrating the feasibility of passive and active immunization against HBV. This work laid the foundation for HBV vaccine development. In subsequent years Krugman and Giles were severely criticized because this work was considered by many commentators as unethical. Krugman and Giles had gone to great lengths to obtain proper informed consent and had fully described their sensitivity to the interests of their subjects. It can now be said that the work was carried out in full accordance with the ethical standards and practices of the 1960s.

Importantly, this initial variation can be considerable, and greater variation can lead to more severe outbreaks. Fortunately, the value of R0 for SARS was around 3, somewhat more than for Ebola but considerably less than figures computed for smallpox and measles. Interestingly, SARS is also similar to smallpox in having a generation time (T) of approximately one week and \u03b8 with a value of 0.11.

This might be true at the local level, but becomes increasingly invalid as individuals move between communities, cities, and national boundaries. One individual may travel from one subpopulation to another, introducing the pathogen to a completely new population of susceptible individuals. In this case, the size of an outbreak is determined by the behaviors of a relatively small number of infected individuals. In the end, the final size of an epidemic and its duration is determined by the structure of the population as much as it is by R0, and estimates of epidemic size need to recognize a series of subpopulation structures through which an infected individual may pass. Therefore epidemics are the result of smaller local outbreaks within subpopulations where most transmission occurs, accompanied by much broader spreading by a small number of infected individuals: increasingly over the past 50 years, this process of seeding has been the result of long-distance air travel.",

For many infections, a reservoir is maintained by a natural cycle between a particular arthropod species and a wild vertebrate species, for example a bird or mammal. Domestic species may become involved, with or without showing disease, and these may help amplify the infection and bring it closer to human habitation. Further species including humans may then become infected, but if they do not provide a source for further arthropod infection, they function as dead-end hosts. Finally, for some viruses a human-arthropod-human cycle occurs, either continually or in situations of high arthropod and human population density.",

(B) Incidence of clinical cases of infectious mononucleosis at different age groups in three different studies. The relatively small number of cases of clinical disease in children is because infections in the young carry a low rate of clinical disease, while the decline in clinical cases in older age groups is because fewer new infections occurred in this age group.",
