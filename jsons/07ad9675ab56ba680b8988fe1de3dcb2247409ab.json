The use of autologous grafts is very popular and there are many clinical studies reporting good results [13, 25, 26] . However, there are many second thoughts such as how to avoid autogenous tissue sacrifice and reduce donor-site morbidity [60] . Although patellar tendon has become the most common graft source for ACL reconstruction (bone-patellar tendon-bone/ BPTB autograft) [19, 41, 60] , there are significant complications from the donor site, such as quadriceps weakness, patellofemoral pain, loss of range of motion (ROM), patella fracture, patellar tendonitis, patella infera syndrome, early cartilage degenerative changes, and arthrofibrosis [2, 28, 37] . On the other hand, hamstrings autografts (semitendinosus and gracilis) have also been popular as graft option, with functional results similar to BPTB but without the extensor mechanism deficit. However, it has been reported that there are some disadvantages including knee flexor strength, variability in hamstring size, fixation limitations, and delayed incorporation [1, 52, 62] . For these reasons, as surgeons try to limit the significant morbidity associated with autograft harvesting, the use of allogenic tissue from a cadaver has emerged as an excellent option [45] . However, ACL reconstruction with allografts carries specific problems and, therefore, there is a dilemma when deciding graft type.",

In addition, allografts offer larger graft sizes, which could be ordered, low incidence of arthrofibrosis, shorter operative time, and improved overall health-related quality of life. However, there are considerable disadvantages including cost, slower graft embodiment, and potential disease transmission (bacterial, viral, and prion) [19] . Thus, the optimal graft choice is still a matter of debate. One can say that the optimal graft should be able to reproduce the anatomy and biomechanics of the native ACL, be incorporated rapidly, provide strong initial fixation, and cause low donor-site morbidity. This chapter reviews the literature about the use of allografts in ACL reconstruction, reporting experimental, clinical, and comparison studies.",

The use of peroneus longus, hamstrings, and fascia latae has also been reported [36] . One study reported that the ultimate failure load for doubled tibialis anterior, tibialis posterior, and peroneus longus were 3,412, 3,391, and 2,483 N, respectively. These values are almost the same or higher than the usual failure loads of all the currently described ACL graft sources [5] . Another study recommended the use of soft tissue allografts such as tibialis anterior tendon or doubled STG rather than allografts with bone plugs such as BPTB and Achilles tendon. This is attributed to the slow incorporation of the allograft bone plug, the greater cross-sectional area available with the soft tissue allograft, and the fact that soft tissue grafts are more readily available since each donor provides six soft tissues but only four bone plug grafts [32] .",

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) viruses, human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV), syphilis, aerobic, and anaerobic bacteria are the main pathogens implicated in allograft infection. Recently, additional concerns have been raised about newly emerging pathogens, such as the West Nile virus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, and prions, which are associated with transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, such as the Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines allograft-associated infections as the ones that occur during the first year after implantation in patients with no known risk factors who are otherwise healthy. Bacterial or fungal infections commonly emerge with signs of inflammation or infection in or near the operative site. Positive wound or blood cultures are necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Viral or parasitic infections are followed by symptoms and signs characteristic of the infectious agent (e.g., fever, lymphadenopathy, weakness) and by positive serological or molecular test results.",

The second way is by contamination by the healthcare provider during the tissue procurement, sterilization, and preservation procedure. In general, the risk of disease transmission depends mainly on tissue type and preparation method.",

It is believed that such events are usually underreported and are difficult to confirm. Surveillance of adverse effects or disease transmission incidents after allograft implantation occurs, in most countries, in a voluntary basis. Buck et al. estimated that the risk of HIV transmission from an infected donor through transplanted tissue is approximately 1 in 1,667,000 [8] . The risk of contracting hepatitis B or C is estimated to be much higher due to the greater prevalence of hepatitis in the general population. Current donor screening, sterilization and preservation techniques have diminished the possibility of distributing allograft material from donors with active viral infection. Concerns remain, however, regarding the initial \"window period,\" during which viral antigen or antibody levels may not be detectable despite infection. The application of advanced serological testing, such as nucleic acid tests, has managed to decrease this \"window period\" to approximately 7 days for HIV and HCV and 8 days for HBV infection. The risk of implanting tissue from an HIV-positive donor is currently estimated at one in 173,000 to one in one million. The risk of implanting HCV-infected tissue is estimated at 1 in 421,000 [69] .",

Eight of the reported infections occurred after ACL reconstruction using tendon allografts. Barbour et al. reported four additional cases of Clostridium septicum infection after ACL reconstruction [6] . In all of the above cases, disease transmission was attributed to the tissue processing conditions. The postoperative infection rate following autograft and allograft ACL reconstruction was investigated by two large retrospective studies. Williams et al. [67] and Indelli et al. [21] reviewed 2,500 and 3,500 ACL reconstructions, respectively. The infection rates found were 0.3% and 0.14%, respectively. There was no significant difference in infection rates between autograft and allograft reconstructions. In a more recent study, Katz et al. also failed to find a higher deep infection rate in allograft compared to autograft ACL reconstruction [27] .

Therefore, the recovered tissues usually undergo chemical soaking with biologic detergents and antibiotic or antiseptic solutions to reduce their bio-burden. These solutions are mostly effective against surface contaminants since they lack tissue penetration. Surface swab cultures are also commonly performed to examine the presence of bacteria and fungi. The sensitivity of swab cultures has been found to range at best between 78% and 92% [65] .

Additionally, the reagents used should penetrate adequately the tissue and should be safely removed from tissue without residue. Tissue banks currently use many different proprietary processes and protocols to achieve successful disinfection and sterilization of allografts.

Differences between the two groups were recorded in stiffness and maximum force but not in maximum stress or material properties [51] .

Deep freezing is the simplest and most widely used technique. Tissues are stored after controlled freezing, at temperatures of at least \u221270\u00b0C to \u221280\u00b0C, which allows their preservation for 3-5 years [55] . This method has no effect on the strength of the graft [22] and it has been shown to reduce graft antigenicity by destroying class II major histocompatibility proteins [3] . Freeze-drying is also commonly used. It involves dehydration of the grafts during freezing in a vacuum to a residual water content level of less than 5%. Therefore, the grafts need to be rehydrated for at least 30 min before implantation, especially if they contain bone blocks along with the soft tissue. Viral load of infected tissue can be decreased to sub-infectious levels with this method [4] , although this has been argued by other reports [12] . Graft antigenicity is also reduced with freeze-drying. This method allows for storage at room temperatures for up to 5 years. However, the time interval between procurement and implantation has been positively correlated with allograft failure rates in ACL reconstruction, thus questioning the shelf life of freeze-dried tissues [58] . Clinical results of freeze-dried allografts have been successful overall [34] , although slightly better results have been reported for fresh-frozen allografts [20] . The third method of tissue preservation is cryopreservation, which employs a controlled rate of freezing with a cryoprotectant media but it has shown no known advantages over fresh-freezing while incurring a considerably higher cost.",

In the case of deep-frozen or freeze-dried allografts, donor cell death has already occurred before implantation. Tendon allografts heal through the formation of fibrovascular scar tissue at the grafttunnel interface followed by the formation of Sharpey's fibers and new bone production. Bone blocks contained in allografts first undergo osteonecrosis followed by incorporation of the graft by the surrounding host can cellous bone. The intraarticular part of the graft acts as a collagen scaffold for host cells to repopulate. Graft revascu larization occurs from the infrapatellar fat pad distally and the posterior synovial tissues proximally [39] . Finally, collagen remodeling involves the replacement of the original large-diameter fibrils with smaller-diameter ones.",

Compared to autografts, allografts were found to demonstrate a prolonged inflammatory response, a greater decrease in structural and mechanical properties and a slower rate of biologic incorporation after implantation [23] . Allogenic tendons also demonstrated a slower onset and rate of revascularization [38] . Greater bone tunnel enlargement observed after allograft ACL reconstruction may also suggest suboptimal healing of allograft tissue [14] . Although allografts seem to lose more of their time-zero strength during remodeling, this has not been associated with a poorer prognosis [24] . The general conclusion is that allografts seem to heal in the same pattern but at a slower rate than autografts.",

Patients should be informed about all the possible risks and benefits of each option. In addition, there are specific limitations including the several different scoring scales, the different kinds of patients with different prognoses, and different surgeons or rehabilitation regimes [16] . During the last years, the international literature presented 14 published clinical comparative studies about allograft and autograft use in ACL reconstruction ( Table 1) . Most of them reported little differences in a long-term basis [19, 31, 33, 41, 43, 49, 54, 56] . However, some studies have reported high rupture rates postoperatively with allografts [10, 60] and others have suggested that use of allograft should be reduced due to increased laxity over time [66] . It is also important to say that all the comparative studies used allografts with bone-blocks (mostly BPTB) and there is a significant lack of comparisons between soft tissue allo-and autografts, which would be extremely useful for evaluating the double-bundle technique. In specific reviews and metaanalyses, the literature moves from accepting the use of allograft tissue to be much more favorable than unfavorable [36] , into presenting the autografts as graft of choice for routine ACL reconstruction with allografts better reserved for multiple ligament-injured knees where extra tissue may be required [44] . In another review, ACL reconstruction with BPTB autograft was favored over BPTB allograft for graft rupture and hop test parameters. However, in the latter study, the irradiated and chemically processed allografts were excluded and the results were not significantly different between the two graft types [30] .",

No significant differences were reported between groups in subjective results, joint effusion, knee tenderness, range of motion, patellofemoral scores, laxity, knee muscle strength, or quadriceps atrophy. The authors, however, recorded two trends of potential significance. Eighty percent of autograft versus 70% of allograft recipients achieved goodto-excellent restoration of anteroposterior stability (<3 mm side-to-side laxity difference), and patients from the allograft group showed favorable results in concentric peak extension torque at 60\u00b0/s. There were four traumatic ruptures only in the allograft group at an average of 11 months p.o. For these reasons the authors concluded that autograft BPTB was their first choice for ACL reconstruction and allograft tissue was the preferred graft choice only when the use of autologous tissue was contraindicated or a knee had multiple ligament injuries.

They found no significant differences in the subjective scores in Lachman and pivot shift tests, knee anterior laxity, crepitus, atrophy, or joint effusion. The allograft group had three traumatic ruptures, nonsignificantly higher incidence of anterior knee pain, and a significantly higher incidence of flexion deficit (although this was only 5\u00b0). On the basis of these results, the authors suggested that autograft BPTB should remain the \"gold standard,\" but allograft remains a reasonable alternative.

Their results led to the conclusion that despite differences in graft type, fixation, and treating surgeon, similar long-term results in stability and function were achieved with BPTB autograft and Achilles tendon allograft reconstruction of the ACL.

Autografts and, more specifically, the \"golden\" standard BPTB and hamstrings tendons have goodto-excellent results in terms of knee stability, patient satisfaction, and return to athletic activity. However, autografts and especially BPTB could cause specific donor-site morbidity and for that allografts have become an alternative option. Allografts have the advantages of no donor-site morbidity, shorter operative time, small incisions, easier and possibly less painful rehabilitation, and no size restrictions. However, questions remain concerning the actual risk of infection and disease transmission after implantation. Even if there is significant progress in screening, processing and sterilization techniques, the risk has not been eliminated. Additionally, when using allograft tissue, one must be aware that it may generate a low-level immune response. It has also been reported that allografts have delayed embodiment time and greater cost, and that the mechanical and biologic effects of the sterilization processes on allograft tissue remain unknown. Overall, the choice of graft material depends on surgeon and patient preference since no graft can match completely the biomechanical properties and function of the native ACL.",
