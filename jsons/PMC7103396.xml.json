In HIV-1, the Gag precursor is a 55 kDa polypeptide that is cleaved by viral protease into mature Gag proteins during or soon after virus budding. The proteolytic processing of Pr55gag yields matrix (MA; p17), capsid (CA; p24), nucleocapsid (NC; p7), p6, and two spacer peptides (SP1 and SP2) that separate NC from CA and p6, respectively (Swanstrom and Wills, 1997). While the blocking of protease-mediated Gag processing has no major effect on virus assembly and budding, it does eliminate viral infectivity (Peng et al., 1989).",

Blocking myristylation by Gly substitution or mutations in downstream basic residues can markedly impair Gag membrane binding or plasma membrane targeting, resulting in blocked virus particle production (Bryant and Ratner, 1990, Freed et al., 1994, Ono and Freed, 1999, Ono et al., 2000a, Ono et al., 2000b, Yuan et al., 1993, Zhou et al., 1994). The assembly domain involved in intermolecular interactions during Gag multimerization is largely located in the C-terminal domain of CA and the downstream NC region, and most mutations introduced into these regions can significantly impair virus particle assembly. The release of virus particles from plasma membrane is mediated by the late (L) domain located within p6 (Gottlinger et al., 1991, Huang et al., 1995).",

            "text": "NC contains an I (\u201cinteraction\u201d) domain. Since the removal of NC or the I domain results in either diminished virus production or the production of virions with densities below that of wt virions, the I domain is believed to facilitate tight Gag packing by promoting protein\u2013protein interaction (Bennett et al., 1993, Ott et al., 2003). Besides contributing to Gag multimerization, HIV-1 NC is thought to play a key role in mediating viral RNA packaging (Berkowitz et al., 1995, Cimarelli et al., 2000, Gorelick et al., 1993, Poon et al., 1996). However, NC-dependent RNA incorporation is not essential for retrovirus assembly, since a foreign protein sequence or leucine zipper motif that does not associate with RNA can serve as NC substitutes to restore VLP production to wt levels (Johnson et al., 2002, Zhang et al., 1998). Furthermore, the neutralization of the highly positive NC charge by substitute mutations results in significant reductions of virus-associated RNA with no major effects on HIV-1 assembly and budding (Wang and Aldovini, 2002, Wang et al., 2004). This strongly suggests that the presence of viral RNA is not important to the HIV-1 assembly process. Other researchers believe that Gag can package non-viral RNA via Gag\u2013RNA interaction through the MA or NC domains (Ott et al., 2005, Purohit et al., 2001, Wang et al., 2003). In addition to explaining (at least in part) why VLPs can still form under some circumstances following NC removal, this suggestion agrees with the proposal that RNA is an essential structural element of retroviral cores (Muriaux et al., 2001).",

It has also been demonstrated that either HIV or SIV MA expression alone is capable of producing VLPs (Gonzalez et al., 1993, Wang et al., 1999). These findings suggest that MA is somewhat similar to NC in its self-association characteristic and the possibility that it promotes Gag multimerization. Here we report our findings that MA (as a substitute for NC) is incapable of repairing the assembly defect incurred by the NC deletion mutation, even though it does retain its RNA packaging function. Our results indicate that RNA packaging is insufficient by itself for efficient VLP assembly, and further suggest that the appropriate positioning of MA and NC is crucial to virus assembly.",

A non-myristylated mutant (myr\u2212) previously shown as being severely defective in membrane binding and incapable of directing VLP assembly and budding (Bryant and Ratner, 1990) served as a control. As expected, poor myr\u2212 Gag cell membrane binding was observed\u2014that is, approximately 20% of total cellular Gag was membrane-associated, compared to over 70% of wt Gag (Fig. 3\n). Results from a statistical analysis indicate that all mutants whose mutations involved a deletion of NC or a replacement of NC with MA exhibited significantly lower membrane binding ability compared to wt (Fig. 3B). The exception to this rule is \u0394MN, which did not show a significantly reduced membrane binding capacity compared with wt (p\n = 0.07). For most mutants, their reduced membrane binding capacities may partly account for their defects in VLP assembly and budding. Remarkably, the NCII showed a membrane binding capacity higher than that of wt at a statistically significant level, demonstrating a good correlation between Gag assembly and membrane binding ability.",

Accordingly, all of these mutations may affect Gag multimerization. We tested this possibility by subjecting intracellular wt and mutant Gag proteins to velocity sedimentation analyses. Negative controls were a non-myristylated (myr\u2212) Gag mutant (severely defective in membrane binding and incapable of producing VLPs) and the myristylated but severely assembly-defective F168A mutant, which contains an alanine substitution at Phe168 of HIV-1 CA (Chang et al., 2007). Our data indicate that most of the wt Gag proteins were recovered at fractions 3 and 4 (Fig. 4\n, top panel). In contrast, the majority of myr\u2212 Gag and nearly one-half of the F168A Gag sedimented at fractions 1 and 2 (Fig. 4, bottom two panels). These results agree with the idea that Gag membrane binding is required for higher-order assembly product formation. With one exception, all of the MA and NC mutants displayed sedimentation profiles similar to that of wt, suggesting that most of them are capable of some degree of self-association despite being defective in VLP assembly. The exception was MAII, which had noticeable portions of recovered Gag sedimented at fractions 1 and 2 (referred to as low-order oligomers). Similar results were observed in repeat independent experiments. Results from a combination of densitometric and statistical analyses indicate that MAII had significantly higher amounts of low-order assembly products compared to wt (p\n = 0.2), suggesting that self-association was more significantly impaired in MAII than in the other \u0394NC -or \u0394MA-derived mutants.",

That NCII can produce VLPs at a level comparable to wt level is not surprising, since the MA region is capable of tolerating insertions of heterologous or large protein sequences, providing that the N-terminal myristylation signal remains intact (Wang et al., 2000a, Wang et al., 2000b). NC inserted into the deleted MA region may contribute to VLP assembly by promoting multimerization and the tight packing of Gag, thus resulting in released VLP migration to a slightly higher density fraction in sucrose gradients (Fig. 5B). However, in addition to being severely defective in VLP assembly, NC/\u0394NC exhibits a particle density lower than that of wt. In addition to MAII, VLP assembly and release was markedly impaired in other mutants in which NC was replaced with MA. Although we observed that replacing MA with NC had no negative effect on VLP assembly, we also noted that switching MA and NC did have a strong effect on VLP production. Combined, these results suggest that MA and NC domain order in Gag\u2014especially NC position\u2014is crucial to virus assembly.",

Evidence that MA as a substitute for NC fails to confer VLP assembly argues against the MA propensity for self-association, as suggested by (Massiah et al., 1994, Morikawa et al., 1998, Wang et al., 1999). Size limitation apparently does not account for the inability of MA to replace NC assembly function, since a putative dimerization domain consisting of approximately 200 coronavirus nucleocapsid residues is capable of restoring VLP production to near-wt level when inserted into the deleted NC region (unpublished results). It is more likely that the central MA globular domain (as opposed to the entire MA sequence) is incapable of self-association when positioned in the deleted NC region.",

Specific MA and adjacent downstream CA contexts are likely required for efficient Gag multimerization; repositioning MA downstream of the CA\u2013SP1 region may cause the steric hindrance of Gag\u2013Gag interaction as a result of conformational changes.

While we did not specifically measure the viral genomic content of each mutant, results from this (Fig. 6) and previous studies (Johnson et al., 2002, Zhang et al., 1998) indicate that VLP assembly can be restored to near-wt levels when a leucine zipper motif is inserted into the deleted NC region, thus suggesting that viral genomic RNA is at least partly dispensable for VLP assembly. However, NC(ZIP) efficiency in VLP production was significantly reduced and RNA packaging capacity concomitantly reduced when MA was removed (\u0394MA/NC[ZIP]). In addition, the simultaneous removal of MA and NC resulted in a reduction of released VLPs with significant RNA deficiencies. Combined, these results (a) agree with those from previous studies indicating that both MA and NC are involved in RNA packaging (Ott et al., 2005, Wang et al., 2003) and (b) support the proposal that RNA is required for efficient VLP assembly (Ott et al., 2005).",

To confirm an association between the measured RNA and \u0394MN VLPs, we subjected viral pellets to further isopycnic centrifugation. Aliquots of each fraction were measured for RNA and analyzed for Gag protein level using Western immunoblotting. The results indicate an association between recovered RNA and VLPs\u2014that is, RNA and Gag levels both peaked in the same fraction (data not shown). This suggests that \u0394MN is still capable of RNA binding, possibly via remaining MA and/or NC residues or another Gag sequence in the construct. At this point we cannot state definitively that RNA is essential for VLP assembly and release, since the ability of mutants to package RNA does not completely correlate with released VLP amounts. Although RNA is required for Moloney murine leukemia virus assembly (Muriaux et al., 2001), current evidence indicates that Gag\u2013RNA binding is not necessary for HIV-1 virus particle assembly (Wang and Aldovini, 2002, Wang et al., 2004).",

            "text": "Previous studies have shown that NC deletions or mutations in basic NC residues result in the production of virions with lower densities (1.13\u20131.14 g/ml) (Bennett et al., 1993), suggesting that NC is a key determinant of virion density. However, in the present study we observed that \u0394NC possesses a wt HIV-1 virion density of approximately 1.16 g/ml. It is unknown whether the ten remaining NC residues in \u0394NC contribute to virion density. A similar protease-defective NC deletion mutant that retains seven NC residues can form virions with densities similar to wt virions without the incorporation of genomic RNA (Ott et al., 2003). Furthermore, our \u0394MN had a virion density similar to wt HIV-1 (Fig. 5A), despite containing less than 30% of wt-level RNA (Fig. 7). According to these results, neither the packaged RNA level nor the presence of NC makes significant contributions to virion density. It may be that the presence of RNA can promote and stabilize Gag\u2013Gag interaction for subsequent higher-order multimerization, while Gag packing is primarily driven by the CA domain that largely determines virion morphology (Ako-Adjei et al., 2005). The positioning of an inserted dimerization domain in NC can affect proper Gag multimerization, which may partly explain why VLPs formed by \u0394MA/NC(ZIP) possess a particle density lower than that of wt (Fig. 6C).",

As previously described (Chiu et al., 2002), the \u0394MA mutation was constructed by deleting a fragment from nt 831 to nt 1147 and replacing it with a SalI linker. For MAII construction, the sequence encoding the MA central globular domain was amplified using the forward primer 5\u2032-GATCGGATCCAAAAAATTCGGTTAAGGCCA-3\u2032 and reverse primer 5\u2032-TCAGAGATCTCTTGCTGTGCTTTTTTCTTAC-3\u2032.

The myristylation-minus (Myr-) mutation (in which the second glycine residue is replaced by alanine) blocks Gag membrane binding and virus production (Chiu et al., 2002).
