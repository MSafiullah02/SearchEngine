Therefore, the development of specific affinity probes for target bacteria is an approach that can effectively minimize interference from sample matrices and concentrate the microorganisms of interest.

            "text": "Immunomagnetic separation is a well-known technique that involves application of antibody-coated magnetic particles to separate pathogenic microorganisms and biological cells from clinical, food, and environmental samples. Madonna et al. (6) developed a rapid method for identifying target bacteria from complex biological sample solutions by coupling immunomagnetic separation with MALDI-MS. This method requires only microliter volumes of materials; for example, a minimum of 1.0 \u00d7 107 bacteria cells/mL could be detected from a physiological buffer in an analysis time of <1 h. In addition, nanoparticles (NPs) have become interesting probes for the separation of analytes from sample solutions because of their large surface-to-volume ratios. Covalent binding between NPs and targets is readily achieved by self-assembling thiolated molecules onto NP surfaces. Lin et al. (7) used mannose-encapsulated gold NPs as nanoscale probes to recognize type 1 pili in Escherichia coli. Gu and colleagues (2)(8) proposed that vancomycin-modified Fe\u2013Pt NPs (biofunctional magnetic NPs) could be used as affinity probes to trap vancomycin-resistant bacteria; they used S\u2013Pt bonding to capture the pathogens at concentrations of ca. 101 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL within 1 h (2).",

The protein profiles in whole-cell MALDI mass spectra have taxonomically characteristic features that can be used to differentiate bacteria at the genus, species, and strain levels, although only a small portion of the bacterial proteome is detected. Direct analyses of intact bacterial cells through MALDI-TOF MS have been used to differentiate bacterial species and subspecies in many clinical microbiology laboratories (10). Fig. 3 presents MALDI mass spectra obtained from the direct analyses of intact bacterial cells of 4 pure cultures including S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, E. coli, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Because the protein profiles clearly differ, they can be used to differentiate these 4 bacteria. Identification and typing of microorganisms using MALDI-MS has been very successful and reviewed by many authors (1)(11)(12)(13)(14). We do not attempt to cover this area here.",

BAMS has the potential to instantaneously detect species-level differences between single cells without the need for sample workup or preconcentration; it offers a high degree of detection specificity and analysis times in the millisecond range. It has been applied to the differentiation of the Bacillus spore species B. thuringiensis and B. atrophaeus (18) and to the detection of airborne Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria (19). The reagentless BAMS reflectron mass spectra of Bacillus spores and vegetative cells have been limited to signals having masses of less than m/z 300. Although BAMS has provided some success at species-level differentiation, it has been hindered by low sensitivity at high mass (18). Improved high-mass sensitivity will extend the fingerprint mass range and increase the probability of detecting more robust species-specific biomarkers.",

CE-MS is a useful technology for the discovery of biomarkers from pathogens (28). Hu et al. (29) identified bacterial species-specific proteins in a sample by performing CE-MS analysis on the proteolytic digest of the cell extract and monitoring only the selected marker peptide masses using MS/MS. Through database searching, they identified peptides that matched proteins associated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, S. aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis and selected these peptides as marker ions for bacterial identification of the mixtures. The method was later termed selective proteotypic-peptide analysis (SPA). The SPA method has also been used to identify the pathogens present in a saliva sample spiked with bacterial mixtures. Minor bacterial species present at even 1% relative abundance were identified with high confidence. Furthermore, the rate of data analysis was greatly improved because only selected markers, rather than whole protein digests, were analyzed. They also reported the identification of bacterial species using CE-MS and a database search algorithm with an empirical scoring function (30).",

The RFLP method has been combined with MALDI-MS to detect hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV and HCV) in human serum samples (42)(43).

PCA is the most commonly used multivariate data analysis tool. PCA is a technique for forming new variables (i.e., principle components) which are linear combinations of the original variables (i.e., m/z values in mass spectra). The principle components account for the differences among spectra. Ilina et al. (55) reported the direct bacterial profiling of 2 human pathogens, N. meningitidis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, using MALDI-MS. Cluster analysis grouped mass spectra into clusters by measuring similarities between spectra. The method successfully separated the mass spectra collected from 3 groups that corresponded to the pathogenic and nonpathogenic Neisseria isolates. Because the protein chip technique SELDI may yield thousands of data points per bacterial sample, computer algorithms must be used to identify useful biomarkers for bacterial identification. Seibold et al. (56) differentiated single strains within the subspecies F. tularensis by combining SELDI-MS with cluster analysis and PCA. ANN combined with SELDI-MS has been used for the identification of N. meningitides (39) and S. aureus (57). The relative abundance for each m/z value was used in the input layer of the ANN model.

When using this approach, spectral reproducibility is not critical as long as the observed masses match the protein masses in the database. To avoid the limited mass accuracy of protein mass measurements, the sequence information of the peptides from virus and bacterial samples has been used to identify the proteins and deduce the microorganism\u2019s source (59). The sequence information can be derived from fragmentation of intact proteins or proteolytic peptides of the intact proteins by searching fragment ion (MS/MS) mass spectra against proteome databases. Top-down proteomics methodology identifies intact proteins without the need for biomarker digestion, separation, and cleanup. This methodology has been used successfully for microbial proteomics in the analysis of bacterial species, either pure or in a mixture (60)(61). Microbial identification has been demonstrated using experimentally derived databases of virus-specific tryptic peptide masses (62) and bacterial protein masses (63).",

Although enrichment of pathogens using functionalized magnetic particles has not been applied to clinical samples, the approach has proved successful for bacteria-spiked biological samples and should play an important role in the near future. Clinical specimens, obtained from pus, wound, sputum, and urine samples, have all been analyzed using selective CE-MS/MS methods (64). The analyses of bacteria-specific marker peptides provided additional advantages of excellent selectivity and high confidence in microbial identification. The bacteria in these clinical samples were cultivated directly, without prior isolation of a pure colony, before performing the selective MS/MS analyses. Many pathogen species (Table 1 ) were identified, including P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, and Streptococcus agalactiae. The rapid and accurate discrimination between methicillin-resistant and methicillin-sensitive microbial strains could lead to major improvements in the treatment strategies of infected patients.

Improvement of the detection limits for microbial cells will continue to be a major task in the years to come. To this end, cell enrichment through affinity techniques will play an increasingly important role. Top-down protein analysis and selective biomarker analysis coupled with affinity techniques will boost the detection capability and accuracy of microbial identifications. PCR amplification of nucleic acids and MS detection might be an alternative approach toward improving sensitivity, especially for the analyses of nonculturable microorganisms.

Furthermore, advances in other MS-related technologies will provide more powerful tools for characterization of pathogens; these technologies include high-speed and high-resolution LC, ion mobility spectrometry, and high-capacity linear ion trap and various high-resolution mass analyzers, such as Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance, Fourier transform-Orbitrap, and time-of-flight mass detectors. The combination of these methodologies and instrumentation will certainly enhance the capabilities of MS for the analysis of pathogens.",
