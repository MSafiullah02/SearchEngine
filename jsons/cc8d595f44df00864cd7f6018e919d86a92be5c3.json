In particular, we would like to explain the projections of the increase in the level of infection over a long period of time, overlapping large local outbreaks in the most populous states in the country. A time-dependent dynamic SEIR model inspired in a model previously used during the outbreak in China was used to analyses the time trajectories of infected, recovered, and deaths. The model has parameters that vary with time and are fitted considering a nonlinear least-squares method. The simulations starting from April 8, 2020, concluded that the time for a peak in Brazil will be in July 21, 2020 with total cumulative infected cases around 982K people; in addition, an estimated total death case will reach to 192K in the end. Besides that, Brazil will reach a peak in terms of daily new infected cases and death cases around the middle of July with 50K cases of infected and almost 6.0K daily deaths.",

For this reason, many studies aim to estimate the contagion curve, the spreading speed and the prediction of deaths. Recently, Imperial College [12] released a study on the current situation of COVID-19 in Brazil and estimate that human-to-human transmission of Sars-CoV-2, virus of the coronavirus family causing the disease COVID-19, in Brazil averages from 1 to 2.8 people. They use a semi-deterministic Bayesian hierarchical model that analyzes the impacts of interventions aimed at restricting the transmission of the virus but it is not clear how effective these measures were. The model adopted follows a function of patterns in urban mobility to estimate deaths, infections, and transmissions. Some models can also predict the evolution of contaminants in real-time, such as the IHME [1] with some important variables such as the transmission rate and the recovery rate, neither static nor variable over time, which makes the result very broad and somewhat vague.",

In this sense, the period also represents the peak time for medical resources get ready. According to the Ministry of Health, Brazil has a total of 441,811 hospital beds distributed in the country's numerous regions. From the number of infected, we can see that the public health system in Brazil may collapse in the middle of June. The number of victims is also expected to grow in the same period. It should be noted that these results are only predictions based on data and population mitigation policies.

Looking at the curves modeled for Cear\u00e1 state, we see that the error curves of infected, recovered and deceased cases also are oscillating around less than 20% in the period from early April to mid-May. Therefore, it is possible to infer that the SEIRDP model provides a good approximation of the results with respect to the collected data. In Fig. 6(a) we provide an estimate of accumulative infected cases, recovery and death cases. Projections show that the currently infected cases will reach a peak around July 20 with about 80K cases. Fig. 6(b) and Fig. 6 (c) present the daily confirmed infected cases and the death cases for Cear\u00e1 over mentioned period, respectively.

Due to the large scale of contamination and low testing capacity, the Ministry of Health started to recommend since mid-March that in places with community transmission only serious cases should be tested. Consequently, many cases of coronavirus may have been underreported, underestimating the results of the model. Another intrinsic problem raised by this study was the delay between the occurrences of deaths and their recording in official data released by the Ministry of Health. Unfortunately, in some states, much information arrived late, this can compromise the projection results.
