The basis of this finding is still under investigation, but it was not considered surprising given that this phenomenon also occurred with whole virus respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines [7]. Therefore, any vaccine target product profile (TPP) must give full safety considerations to avoid the immunopotentiation (Box 1).",

Currently, those at the highest risk of acquiring COVID-19 or suffering significant health deterioration are frontline healthcare workers, individuals over the age of 60 years, or those with underlying diabetes and hypertension [8]. Therefore, such populations might be prioritized for vaccine clinical trials or licensure. Still, another feature is the real possibility that a new vaccine for COVID-19 may not be available in time for this current epidemic or pandemic. Therefore, it should be made available for potential stockpiling. Along those lines, vaccines developed and produced for global health security or biodefense are often considered less profitable than traditional childhood and adult vaccines. For that reason, very few of the major multinational pharmaceutical companies appear to have expressed upfront commercial interest in entering this space.",

According to an industry newsletter, Johnson & Johnson is one of the few multinational companies embarking on COVID-19 vaccines [20]; similar to their Ebola vaccine platform, they are employing Janssen\u2019s AdVac\u00ae adenoviral vector and manufacturing in their PER.C6\u00ae cell line technology [20, 21]. In addition, researchers at the University of Hong Kong have developed a live influenza vaccine that expresses SARS-CoV-2 proteins [22]. Finally, Codagenix has developed a \u201ccodon deoptimization\u201d technology to attenuate viruses [23] and is exploring SARS-CoV-2 vaccine strategies. A major advantage of whole virus vaccines is their inherent immunogenicity and ability to stimulate toll-like receptors (TLRs) including TLR 3, TLR 7/8, and TLR 9. However, live virus vaccines often require extensive additional testing to confirm their safety. This is especially an issue for coronavirus vaccines, given the findings of increased infectivity following immunization with live or killed whole virus SARS coronavirus vaccines [7].",

Already, under funding from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness (CEPI), the University of Queensland is synthesizing viral surface proteins, to present them more easily to the immune system. Moreover, Novavax has developed and produced immunogenic virus-like nanoparticles based on recombinant expression of the S-protein [24] while Clover Biopharmaceuticals is developing a subunit vaccine consisted of a trimerized SARS-CoV-2 S-protein using their patented Trimer-Tag\u00ae technology [14], although some full-length S-proteins for SARS also elicit increased infectivity and eosinophilic infiltration. Accordingly, a consortium led by Texas Children\u2019s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development at Baylor College of Medicine (including University of Texas Medical Branch and New York Blood Center) has developed and tested a subunit vaccine comprised of only the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV S-protein [7, 25, 26]. When formulated on alum, the SARS-CoV RBD vaccine elicits high levels of protective immunity on the homologous virus challenge. An advantage of the RBD-based vaccine is its ability to minimize host immunopotentiation [7]. Initial findings that the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs exhibit more than 80% amino acid similarity and bind to the same ACE2 receptor offer an opportunity to develop either protein as a subunit vaccine.",

However, each of these vaccines may require additional manufacturing steps and formal toxicology testing before submitting a regulatory package to national regulatory agencies and be able to commence the clinical development, first with phase 1 clinical trials for safety and immunogenicity, and later, phase 2 and phase 3 trials for both safety and efficacy. The next few months represent a critical period for determining whether the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan and Central China will spread across Asia and globally, or whether the warmer months of spring and summer in the Northern Hemisphere will reduce transmission of typically seasonal coronavirus infections. In the former situation, we will urgently require new vaccines. However, the challenge remains. Moving forward, we must recognize that we have had a new major coronavirus epidemic every decade in the twenty-first century\u2014SARS in the 2000s, MERS in the 2010s, and now COVID-19. It is, therefore, a global security priority to advance and stockpile coronavirus vaccines, and to identify international funding mechanisms to support their development, manufacture, and storage. As a matter of fact, this recent outbreak should serve as a beacon to call upon the international research community to not only react but also prepare for the next coronavirus crossing into mammals. A pan-coronavirus vaccine is urgently needed and appears scientifically feasible if sufficient resources are made available in due time.",
