            "text": "Proteases or proteinases are proteolytic enzymes that regulate biological processes in cellular organisms and viruses. Proteases are classified according to their catalytic site into four major classes: cysteine (thiol) proteases, serine proteases, aspartyl (acid) proteases, and metalloproteases. Of the 21 families of cysteine proteses discovered so far, almost half of them are coded by viruses (Grzonka et al., 2001). The best characterized family of cysteine proteases is the \u2018papain\u2019 family characterized by a two-domain structure that contains an active site (catalytic pocket) for substrate binding. Some RNA virus-encoded papain-like cysteine proteases with \u2018Cysteine(Cys)-Histidine(His)-Aspartate(Asp)\u2019 catalytic triads employ a structural \u2018Zn2+-binding motif\u2019 residing between the loops of the two \u03b2-barrel folds (Sommergruber et al., 1997, Yu and Lloyd, 1992). However, the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) leader protease (Lpro), one of the most well characterized viral papain-like proteases (Ryan and Flint, 1997), including the rubella virus (RUBV) p150 (Chen et al., 1996) and the human coronavirus-229E (HCoV-229E) PL1pro (Herold et al., 1998) has shown a \u2018Cys-His\u2019 catalytic \u2018dyad\u2019 instead of a \u2018triad\u2019. The RNA-interacting Zn2+-binding proteases are critical in virus replications that include UL52 of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) (Chen et al., 2005), the nucleocapsids of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) and murine-leukaemia virus (MLV) (Gorelick et al., 1996, Mark-Danieli et al., 2005), the V-protein of Sendai virus (SENV) (Fukuhara et al., 2002), and the NS5A of hepatitis C virus (HCV) (Tellinghuisen et al., 2004). Of the several different \u2018Ca2+-binding motifs\u2019, the most common is a \u2018helix-loop-helix\u2019 structure referred to as the \u2018EF-hand\u2019. Viral \u2018EF-hand Ca2+-binding motifs\u2019 are also reported in rotavirus-VP7, HIV-1-gp41 and polyomavirus-VP1 structural proteins, including the RUBV-nonstructural p150 (Zhou et al., 2007).",

The HEV open reading frame 1 (ORF1) codes for nonstructural polyprotein (\u223c186 kDa) wherein the validity of a papain-like cysteine protease-domain (a.a. 434\u2013590) (Fig. 1A) still remains a bottle-neck in the understanding of its biology. Also, the expression and purification of HEV-protease and therefore, its biochemical or biophysical characterization is not achieved, so far. Nevertheless, there is ample convincing molecular evidences, showing ORF1 polyprotein processing (Parvez, 2013, Karpe and Lole, 2011, Sehgal et al., 2006, Ropp et al., 2000, Ansari et al., 2000) along with a few contesting reports (Perttil\u00e4 et al., 2013, Suppiah et al., 2011). Very recently, using HEV-SAR55 replicon-system, the indispensability of ORF1 protease-domain \u2018catalytic\u2019 as well as X-domain \u2018protease-substrate\u2019 residues in HEV replication in hepatoma S10-3 cells, is demonstrated (Parvez, 2013). With this supporting information and the known biology of genetically-close RNA virus proteases, we proposed a three-dimensional (3D) structure of HEV-protease using homology modeling.",

Briefly, an alignment of template-target sequences, the atomic coordinates of the template, and a script file served as the input. First, the files of target and template sequences were converted into MODELLER-PIR and the target-template alignment sequences were converted into MODELLER-PAP formats. MODELLER then calculated five 3D models (starting and ending models 1-5) of HEV-protease. The output files in PDB format that contained coordinates of the generated models were viewed in PyMOL1.6. The final modeled structure validation was performed in PROCHECK v.3.5 (http://nihserver.mbi.ucla.edu/SAVES/). Of the Ramachandran plots obtained using the PDB files of the predicted models, the one showing about 87% residues in the most favored regions, and about 1.3% in the disallowed region, was selected.

In HCoV-229E PL1pro, the conserved catalytic \u2018Cys1054-His1205\u2019 dyad was found to be indispensable for its proteolytic activity (Herold et al., 1998). Further, the RUBV-p150 \u2018Cys1152-His1273\u2019 and FMDV-Lpro \u2018Cys51-His148\u2019 have been reported as Zn2+-dependent catalytic dyads (Liu et al., 2000, Chen et al., 1996, Gorbalenya et al., 1991). Our comparative analysis thus, recognized the HEV \u2018Cys434-His443\u2019 homologue of RUBV that constituted the putative catalytic dyad. This was however, in contrast with the previously sequence homology-based prediction of \u2018Cys434-His590\u2019 as catalytic residues in the HEV-protease (Koonin et al., 1992). Moreover, in the Mexican and Burmese strains, \u2018His590\u2019 is substituted with \u2018leucine\u2019 and \u2018tyrosine\u2019, respectively, showing non-conservational dispensability of histidine. A previous alignment analysis of FMDV-Lpro with the equivalent regions of equine rhinitis virus (ERV-1 and ERV-2) polyproteins had shown complete conservation of the active \u2018Cys51\u2019 amongst the three aphthoviruses but not \u2018His148\u2019, except ERV-2 (Gorbalenya et al., 1991). This also supports the non-conservation and positional dispensability of the second catalytic \u2018histidine\u2019 in viral thiol-proteases, in general. Although, the conserved \u2018Cys434\u2019 and non-conserved \u2018His590\u2019 was found non-essential in HEV viability, the indispensability of highly conserved \u2018His443\u2019 (Parvez, 2013) does support our structural recognition of the catalytic dyad. Very reasonably, such a structural diversity of cysteine proteases could be related to the extremely high mutation rate of the viral RNA genomes. As a result, many viral proteases have functionally diverged to the point where sequence similarity between homologues can be rarely detected.",

We therefore, using the RUBV-p150 as molecular and structural surrogate-model, identified a \u2018Zn2+ binding motif\u2019 homologue of HEV-protease. Structural Zn2+-binding sites are generally coordinated by four cysteines and a histidine as ligands (Zhou et al., 2009). In line with this, a \u2018His458\u2019 was also clustered with four \u2018cysteines\u2019 in our predicted Zn2+-binding pocket, unlike RUBV-p150 model where no histidine was present among five cysteines (Fig. 3). However, the human rhinovirus 2 (HRV2) and poliovirus 2A proteases Zn-binding motifs, \u2018Cys52-Cys54-Cys112-His114\u2019 (Sommergruber et al., 1997) and \u2018Cys55-Cys57-Cys115-His117\u2019 (Yu and Lloyd, 1992), respectively, has three cysteines plus a histidine. As understood, such structural and functional diversity could be clearly attributed to the extreme mutability and host-adaptability of RNA viruses in their evolutionary processes. Notably, the critical role of Zn2+-binding papain-like proteases in viral life cycles are well known. Previously, using the genomic replicon-system, the RUBV-p150 \u2018Cys1175, Cys1178, Cys1225 and Cys1227\u2019 residues are shown essential in its replication (Zhou et al., 2009). In line with this, our recent analysis of the HEV-protease domain nonviable mutants of Cys457, Cys459, Cys481 and Cys483 residues (Parvez, 2013), strongly support potentiality of the predicted \u2018Zn2+-binding motif\u2019.",

In the RUBV-P150 model, the \u2018Ca2+/CaM-binding motif\u2019 partially overlaps the \u2018Zn2+-binding motif\u2019, including the catalytic \u2018Cys1152-His1273\u2019 dyad (Zhou et al., 2007). In our predicted model, while the catalytic \u2018H1273\u2019, was excluded in RUBV \u2018Ca2+/CaM-binding\u2019 sequences, both \u2018Cys434\u2019 and \u2018His443\u2019 of the dyad remained out of its HEV equivalent. Moreover, the canonical \u2018EF-hand motif\u2019 signature \u2018D-X-[DNS]-[ILVFYW]-[DEN]-G-[GP]-XX-DE\u2019 is described to form the Ca2+-binding loops in living systems (Zhou et al., 2007). Notably, presence of the essential cysteine residues in the overlapping putative \u2018Ca2+/CaM-binding motif\u2019, also suggested formation of intramolecular disulfide-bridges between cysteines that might structurally facilitate the orientation of the \u2018EF-hand\u2019 towards Ca2+ binding. Our analysis of protein secondary structure also confirmed formations of three disulfide-bridges between active cysteines.",

This is however, not reported in viral proteins, including nonstructural cysteine proteases so far. In our proposed model, W476 is therefore predicted to pair with the upstream-located W437 that could form the putative \u2018W437-W476/rs5-domain\u2019. Like closely-related virus polyproteins, HEV ORF1 also contains a \u2018proline-rich hypervariable region\u2019 followed by the protease-domain (Fig. 1A) that indicates its possible interaction with the viral protease through predicted \u2018W437-W476\u2019 module.",

These results are however, not a confirmation of the structures presented, but do present testable hypotheses about the structure and function of the HEV-protease. Therefore, experimental validations involving molecular, biochemical and biophysical methods are further needed. Knowledge of the structure of HEV-protease would be thus, valuable for understanding the virus biology and classification as well as antiviral-drug development.",
