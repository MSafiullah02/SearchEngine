The secondary structure and hydrophobicity analyses on the sequence of the S protein were performed with DNASIS MAX (Ver. 2.0) software (MiraiBio), and peptide sequences that correspond to the potential surface regions of the S proteins were designed based on the combined data from the above protein analyses.

The NH2 termini of peptides were acetylated on the resin with 150 g/L acetic anhydride in dimethyl formamide. The acetylated peptides were cleaved from the resins, and side-chain-protecting groups were removed by cleavage solution containing 25 g/L ethanedithiol and 50 g/L thioanisole in trifluoroacetic acid. The peptides were then precipitated with cold diethyl ether, washed, and lyophilized. The cleaved peptides were purified with Agilent Technologies 1100 Series analytical and preparative HPLC systems using linear gradients formed from the solvent systems A (50 mL/L trifluoroacetic acid in H2O) and B (0.5 mL/L trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile) (12). The identities of purified peptides were confirmed by mass spectrometry on an Ettan\u2122 matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight Pro Mass Spectrometer (Amersham Biosciences).",

The results of immunofluorescent confocal microscopy indicated that four of the six synthetic peptides, S2, S3, S5, and S6, raised antibodies that could specifically recognize SARS-CoV, which suggested the efficacy of using synthetic peptides as antigens to elicit specific immune responses.",

Their immunoassays indicated that the SG3, S10, and S22 analogs of the S protein were recognized by the IgG in sera from recovered SARS patients. Their SG3 analog is suggested to be the most specific immunogenic region on the S protein. Our work clearly demonstrated that the immunogenic region of their SG3 analog (residues 735\u2013882) could be further delineated to residues 788\u2013820, which corresponds to our S5 peptide (Table 1 ). In addition, our S6 peptide (residues 1002\u20131030; Table 1 ) could be another minimum and significant immunogenic region of their S10 and S22 analogs of S protein. In addition, free S6 peptide is capable of inducing specific antibodies in monkeys.",

The design of the peptide sequences was deliberately targeted to the surface region of the S protein. By use of sequence homology analysis, secondary structure, and hydrophobicity predictions, we could predict the potential surface region of the S protein. Most of the designed peptides were expected to adopt a helix motif to give a rigid structure to enhance antigenicity. To further enhance the antigenicity of these peptides, later work may include introducing several constraints to these peptides to increase structural rigidity, such as by adding linkers to cyclize the linear peptides or disulfide bonds for peptide stabilization. In addition, from the in silico energy minimization studies of our peptides, the predicted loop size carried on the peptide may reflect its antigenicity; thus, the loop structures of these peptides could be further adjusted and strengthened to optimize the corresponding antigenicity. In addition, our initial attempts at antibody production using the six synthetic peptides had deliberately avoided the regions rich in posttranslation modifications, such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, to simplify the situation for preliminary analysis.",

This can be done by vaccinating noninfected monkeys with these synthetic peptides. After exposure of these vaccinated monkeys to live SARS-CoV, their health status could be monitored to determine the efficacy of these synthetic peptides as potential SARS vaccines. The monkey strain M. fascicularis would be a good choice for this animal test because this strain has previously been demonstrated as a potent host of SARS-CoV that developed SARS symptoms after SARS-CoV infection (14). Because of the high infectiousness of SARS-CoV, a biosafety P3/P4 level laboratory is required whenever performing any experiment using live SARS-CoV to prevent unpredictable outbreaks of SARS.",

To date, vaccination against SARS is not available. A synthetic peptide-based approach could be a rapid initial step for providing useful information for SARS-related research. The results of synthetic peptide studies enable preliminary information about the possible antigenic sites on the native viral protein to be generated, which provides insights for generating a recombinant protein analog that could better mimic the conformation of the epitope regions. Moreover, the biophysical properties and binding kinetics of these synthetic peptide candidates could be systematically characterized to allow elucidation of the structural and functional relationships of different SARS-CoV proteins. Databases designed to contain future \u201cnovel\u201d SARS-related RNA and protein sequences are being constructed, and updating of these databases will be an ongoing task to monitor \u201cpolymorphisms\u201d in the viral RNA and protein sequences. The quality (biologically active sequences) and quantities of our peptide stocks can be easily adjusted to accommodate the ongoing investigation of polymorphisms in the SARS-CoV genome that produce changes in the primary sequences of the viral protein. Eventually, we will establish peptide databases that cover the motifs corresponding to the biologically active functional and structural regions of the SARS-CoV proteins. Our experimental data are informative and could advance the understanding of SARS, which is necessary if we are to be prepared for possible recurrences of this disease.",
