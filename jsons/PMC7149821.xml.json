Exposure to other infected animals or contaminated fomites is important for agents with direct transmission, such as those inducing respiratory disease (e.g., feline herpesvirus 1, canine bordetellosis) or gastroenteritis (e.g., canine and feline giardiasis, canine and feline parvovirus infection). Potential exposure to vectors (e.g., mosquitoes for dirofilariasis; ticks for Lyme borreliosis [Ixodes spp.], ehrlichiosis [Rhipicephalus sanguineus], Rocky Mountain spotted fever [RMSF; Dermacentor spp.], babesiosis [R. sanguineus]) or appropriate travel history (e.g., coccidioidomycosis in the Southwest; RMSF in the Southeast; blastomycosis in the Mississippi, Missouri, and Ohio River valleys) can also suggest an infectious disease. Vaccination history, deworming history, and determination of whether other animals or people in the environment are also affected can aid in ranking infectious diseases on a differential diagnoses list.",

Monocytosis can be induced by persistent infection with a number of intracellular agents that result in persistent infection. Polyclonal (e.g., multiple infectious causes) or monoclonal gammopathies (e.g., usually induced by neoplasia, rarely associated with canine ehrlichiosis) may suggest chronic immune stimulation.

Both antibody classes can persist in serum for months after exposure. Cross-reactivity with B. burgdorferi antigens used in IFA and ELISA occurs with other spirochetes; thus, a positive titer does not document exposure to B. burgdorferi. B. burgdorferi vaccines induce antibodies that are detected by IFA and ELISA and one of the available point-of-care assays.*\nWestern immunoblot can differentiate vaccine-induced antibodies from those from natural infection (Jacobsen, Chang, and Shin, 1996). A point-of-care kit\u2020\ncommercially available for detection of B. burgdorferi antibodies against the C6 peptide, E. canis antibodies, and Dirofilaria immitis antigen was licensed recently. Antibodies against the C6 peptide are not induced by vaccination, so positive results of this kit denote exposure to B. burgdorferi. Some nonpathogenic strains of B. burgdorferi induce antibody production but not clinical disease (Breitschwerdt, 1995). Some dogs with acute Lyme disease are seronegative on initial testing; documentation of an increasing antibody titer can suggest recent exposure. Antibody titers greater than or equal to 1:1000 have been detected in clinically normal dogs. Healthy dogs develop the same antibody responses as clinically ill dogs, however. Because of these factors, interpretation of serum antibody titers is difficult. Serum antibodies against B. burgdorferi only documents exposure to B. burgdorferi (or a similar antigen), not clinical disease. Finding a higher titer in CSF than in serum occurs in some dogs with suspected neurologic disease secondary to Lyme disease.",

The oocysts cannot be distinguished grossly from Hammondia hammondi or Besnoitia darlingi (nonpathogenic coccidians infecting cats). Sporulated oocysts isolated from feces can be inoculated into mice or tissue cultures for definitive identification. Because oocyst shedding has rarely been documented in cats with subfatal, clinical toxoplasmosis, the diagnostic usefulness of fecal examination is limited. Cats with clinical signs referable to T. gondii should undergo fecal evaluation, however, because of potential zoonotic risk.",

ELISA can be used to measure serum IgM antibodies. CSF antibodies to distemper virus are increased in some dogs subsequently diagnosed histopathologically as having distemper encephalitis. False-positive results can occur in CSF samples contaminated with blood. Concurrent measurement of serum antibody concentrations can be helpful; if CSF concentrations are greater than serum concentrations, the antibody in CSF had to be produced locally and suggests CNS distemper. Detection of serum IgG antibodies is of minimal diagnostic value because a positive titer could develop secondary to vaccination or previous exposure. A fourfold increase in serum IgG titer over a 3- to 4-week period suggests recent infection. Detection of circulating IgM antibodies is consistent with recent infection but not clinical disease. A point-of-care assay for detection of canine distemper antibodies is available.*\nVaccinated dogs, seropositive in this assay, probably do not need to be boosted. A presumptive diagnosis of distemper encephalitis can be made with increased CSF protein and leukocytes (lymphocytes predominating) plus a positive CSF antibody titer in a sample not contaminated with peripheral blood. Definitive diagnosis of canine distemper infection requires demonstration of viral inclusions by cytologic examination (see Color Plates 2D and 2E), direct fluorescent antibody staining of cytologic or histopathologic specimens, histopathologic evaluation, or PCR documentation of distemper viral DNA in peripheral blood, CSF, or conjunctival scrapings. (See Appendix I for availability of PCR testing.) Viral inclusions can rarely be found in erythrocytes, leukocytes, and leukocyte precursors of infected dogs. Inclusions are generally present for only 2 to 9 days after infection and therefore often are not present when clinical signs occur. Inclusions may be easier to find in smears made from buffy coats or bone marrow aspirates than those made from peripheral blood. Viral particles can be detected by immunofluorescence in cells from the tonsils, respiratory tree, urinary tract, conjunctival scrapings, and CSF for 5 to 21 days after infection.",

Definitive diagnosis of FIP requires histopathologic evaluation of tissues. Lesions visible by light microscopy are generally pathognomonic, but immunohistochemistry can be used to confirm coronavirus particles. PCR can also detect coronavirus particles in effusions, tissues, and blood (Barr, 1996). Detecting coronavirus by PCR in effusions and tissues predicts FIP, but detection in blood does not. Hyperproteinemia and polyclonal gammopathy (detected by electrophoresis; see Chapter 12) can occur, particularly in the noneffusive form. Monoclonal gammopathy rarely occurs. Classic nonseptic pyogranulomatous exudate or modified transudate with high protein and relatively low cell count (see Chapter 10) is commonly used for presumptive diagnosis. Electrophoresis can also be performed on body fluids. A gamma globulin fraction greater than or equal to 32% is highly suggestive of FIP, whereas an albumin:globulin ratio in body fluid greater than 0.81 probably rules out FIP (Shelly, Scarlett-Kranz, and Blue, 1998).",

The assays are very specific; no cross-reactivity exists with D. reconditum. The positive predictive value for heartworm disease is less than 100%, however, because circulating antibodies can be present in cats that have cleared the infection naturally. False-negative antibody test results also occur; therefore, serum antibody and antigen tests should be performed in concert in cats with suspected dirofilariasis (Synder et al, 2000).",
