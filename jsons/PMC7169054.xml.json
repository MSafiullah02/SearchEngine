Leiss emphasizes the importance of \u201csystemic risk,\u201d and he refers to a conference in 2006. Professor Haimes responds that he presented a paper at that meeting, and he hopes that Leiss will prepare a paper to present his ideas.",

Siegrist notes that while the review was thought\u2010provoking and important for identifying research gaps, it may not have sufficiently clarified the distinction between trust and confidence measures. Earle responds that the issues pointed out by Siegrist are manageable with greater use of the consensus model in risk management settings. It is our intention that review articles such as Earle's will provoke interesting debates among our readers, and we welcome others to submit comments.",

Toru Watanabe, Timothy Bartrand, Mark Weir, Tatsuo Omura, and Charles Haas developed a dose\u2010response model using mice\u2010based and human epidemiological data. An exponential model provided the most effective fit to the data and led the authors to estimate a dose of SARS\u2010CoV between 16 and 160 plague\u2010forming units (PFU)/person for an apartment building in Hong Kong, depending on the floor. The authors note that this dose\u2010response model helps us understand what would happen if SARS reemerged.",

Katsuichiro Goda and Jiandong Ren developed a multivariate model to assess the outcomes of combinations of events and structures, applying it to an area of southwestern British Columbia. They found that their model form (Gumbel copula) was predictive of outcomes and recommend it as a way of more rapidly evaluating economic losses.",

Lianfa Li, Jinfeng Wang, Hareton Leung, and Chengsheng Jiang built a Bayesian network (BN) that integrates multiple factors and quantification of uncertainties within their assessment system. The authors also used data mining and spatial data analysis to enhance the tool. They report that the model predicted more accurately than other options.",

Stephen Brown tested the first part of this expectation with a telephone survey of 255 Australians. Drivers were asked questions about speeding perceptions and behavior, and then follow\u2010ups were asked 6 and 14 weeks later. During weeks 2 through 5, an anti\u2010speeding mass media campaign was conducted. After controlling for baseline perceptions, the authors reported a lower frequency of self\u2010reported speeding among those with stronger anti\u2010speeding perceptions. Notably, decreases in risk perception about speeding did not lead to changes in self\u2010reported speeding.",

Unraveling these associations is important to understanding public perceptions and behaviors, and likely responses to public policy.",
