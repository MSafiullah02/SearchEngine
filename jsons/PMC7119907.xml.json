            "text": "In the last 15 years, China\u2019s AIDS response has gone from denial to global example. The combination of a strong national authority with resources and political will and a determination to apply evidence-based approaches has demonstrated the importance of both. In the years following the SARS epidemic in 2003, China\u2019s public health leaders have aggressively analyzed and addressed their HIV/AIDS epidemic, putting in place pragmatic new policies and programs like harm reduction for people who inject drugs (PWID) and test-and-treat programs for large numbers of previously unidentified people living with HIV (PLWH). In China, where government is the main actor for policy formulation and service provision, the role of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) has historically been weak. Nevertheless, China\u2019s HIV/AIDS response has provided an opportunity for its fledgling NGO community to demonstrate its importance as an essential partner in achieving national goals, in this case the control of China\u2019s HIV epidemic. Globally the HIV/AIDS response relies on active participation of NGOs and civil society, and important progress has been made in the response due to their advocacy in critical areas like access to medicines, treatment compliance support, and outreach to marginalized at-risk groups. China has opened the door for NGO participation in the response, partly due to donor pressure, but also because of official acknowledgment of the important role these groups must play in controlling the epidemic. There is now strong policy support for the role of NGOs in China\u2019s HIV/AIDS response, but this role is under threat as the political space for NGOs shrinks. This may threaten future efforts to control China\u2019s HIV epidemic. In this chapter, the unique contributions of China\u2019s HIV/AIDS NGOs and the expansion of the political space for their role over the last 20 years are reviewed. Additionally, recent government moves to more closely control NGOs, and their work and funding through more restrictive legislation is discussed as this may undermine China\u2019s success in controlling the epidemic in the coming years.",

Groups representing PLWH have a mandated role in most international and national AIDS policy, program, and funding bodies. Advocacy groups representing gay men and AIDS patients in the \u201cglobal south\u201d have put pressure on governments and industry to increase funding and access for treatment and prevention programs. This led to new norms about ensuring access to essential medicines and lifesaving drugs in poor countries. Services provided by AIDS NGOs, for outreach to gay men and other men who have sex with men (MSM), condom distribution and promotion for sex workers, syringe exchange for PWID, youth sex education programs, sex worker legal protection services, treatment and support to AIDS patients, AIDS orphans support programs, and many other critical parts of global and national AIDS programs, have been a key feature of successful AIDS responses in many countries. These groups have been able to reach and represent hidden and underrepresented groups with essential risk-reduction education, recruitment for HIV testing and treatment, and assistance in accessing care and support. These NGOs have also played an important role in representing the needs and perspectives of marginalized groups in policy and program formulation.",

            "text": "Once effective AIDS treatment became available in the 1990s, community groups and local NGOs became the backbone of AIDS treatment support in rural communities where trained medical personnel are scarce (Farmer et al. 2001). Many of the important advances in the AIDS response have come through NGO organizing and advocacy. For example, ACT UP in the United States (US) pushed for fast tracking approvals for AIDS medications. The Treatment Access Campaign in South Africa spearheaded a global movement for affordable AIDS drugs (Heywood 2009). And finally, Sonagachi in India demonstrated that protecting sex workers\u2019 rights increased their condom use and found that in project cities, HIV prevalence among sex workers was 11% compared to other Indian cities where it exceeded 50% (Jana et al. 1999). These examples and many others attest to the effectiveness of both peer group approaches and prevention services provided by NGOs and their value for supporting treatment programs in their communities.",

The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (hereafter the Global Fund) requires civil society participation in its governance board, the CCM (country coordinating mechanism), for proposal submission and execution. Furthermore, the \u201cGIPA\u201d principle (\u201cGreater Involvement of People Living with HIV/AIDS\u201d) is promoted by UNAIDS and calls for the greater participation in the response of people infected and affected by HIV. This has become an important mechanism for patient groups to form and participate in policy and program decision-making as well as service delivery. These global norms have secured a novel and secure political space for NGOs in the global AIDS response (Sidib\u00e9 et al. 2010).",

In other countries NGOs often deliver direct services, but in China, the government system is the main provider of health and other social services to its vast population. As the number of Chinese NGOs has expanded, some have assumed roles in service delivery in partnership with government, but most operate as research organizations and as advocacy groups on issues like the environment, energy policy, HIV/AIDS, consumer rights, legal reform, and other issues of social and political concern. Many of these organizations are linked to global and transnational networks, which have provided important support both financially and on strategy development, often in collaboration with global agencies and bilateral and multilateral donors.",

Requirements for social organizations include having an office, professional employees, and funds of 30,000 RMB, while requirements for \u201cpeople-run non-enterprise\u201d organizations include having an office, professional employees, and funds of 30,000\u201350,000 RMB. Many NGOs do not bother to officially register with the Ministry of Civil Affairs and operate either without any registration or register as a company, a much easier path to legal status. Some service-providing NGOs work closely with government agencies or with GONGOs either through direct contract work or as members of advisory and governance boards, like the Global Fund\u2019s CCM. But other NGOs, especially those doing advocacy or research, can be viewed with suspicion by government leaders, especially at the local level, who see them as outside government supervision and authority structures. There are restrictions on establishing nationwide networks (except for GONGOs).",

The HIV/AIDS response has often been cited as an example of how the policy environment has expanded for NGOs in China. The combination of internal recognition of the essential roles that such NGOs have played in the global response and external pressures and advocacy through funding mandates and global norms promoted by international partners has pushed forward a more embracing policy environment (Kaufman 2012).",

This represented a milestone event in the history of NGO participation in China\u2019s response to HIV/AIDS. Australia\u2019s foreign aid agency, AusAID, provided 2 million Australian dollars as a supplemental grant to a 100 million US dollar World Bank Project in China on Disease Prevention, known as Health 7. Health 7 worked with the Ministry of Health and the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine, which was the predecessor of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC). The initiative targeted 17 provinces and cities. The AusAID funds were exclusively to support NGO participation in HIV/AIDS programs. At that time, China had limited funding in the health sector and government institutes had little funding for HIV/AIDS programs. Even while government partners were surprised and a bit shocked by the AusAID mandate, China\u2019s government felt obliged to follow the donor\u2019s requirement. But China AIDS NGOs at that time had limited capacity and were unable to write project proposals or draft work plans. Thus, the government worked with the NGOs, wrote work plans for them, and gradually helped them increase their capacity. Following the example of Health 7, the United Kingdom\u2019s Department for International Development (DFID) provided support for NGOs for the World Bank\u2019s Basic Health Services Project (Health 8), which began in 1998.",

Her statements were echoed by many other high-ranking government officials including the then-Party secretary to the Ministry of Health, Gao Qiang.

It was one of the earliest accurate sources of information on the AIDS epidemic among paid plasma donors in central China and has remained an important advocacy group for the villagers in Henan Province who were inadvertently infected. Positive Art, a Beijing-based art collective, and Mangrove Group at Ditan Hospital were two of the earliest support groups for PLWH. Finally, the Chinese Alliance of People Living with HIV/AIDS (CAP+), launched in the early 2000s, formed a larger coalition for grassroots groups, bringing together diverse groups such as rural women and young men living with HIV and linking them to the Global Network of People Living with AIDS (GNP+) and other global and regional networks of PLWH (Kaufman et al. 2014).",

At the same time, the publication opened political space for engagement and work on sexual rights and AIDS prevention, in part by challenging social conventions and forcing the Chinese Psychiatry Association to remove homosexuality from its list of mental diseases (Zhang and Kaufman 2005). Published for 11 years, Friend Exchange reached countless homosexual, bisexual, and transgender men and women in China with lifesaving information about AIDS prevention as well as psychological support and understanding for lifestyles and sexual orientations that are still highly stigmatized in China. It became the most respected and authoritative source of information on homosexuality and LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) issues in China, conducting countless surveys among its extensive readership and thereby generating information from the community itself on critical issues (e.g., condom use, numbers of sexual partners, attitudes toward safe sexual practices) for the understanding of the HIV epidemic among this key, vulnerable population.",

This normalization of NGO participation in governance opened the door for the Chinese AIDS NGO community to really demonstrate their value and build effective partnerships with national and local government agencies. Empowered by donor engagement and funding, many groups professionalized and moved from volunteer organizations to organizations with greater capacity both technically and managerially. Government and donor funding supported this process with trainings and capacity building workshops. When the Global Fund was established in 2002, its own mandated governance mechanism required establishment of a \u201cCountry Coordinating Mechanism\u201d (CCM) with civil society representatives to review, approve, and submit applications.

Today, its own resources and technical capabilities are the primary driver of its HIV/AIDS response, and global donors have called for a re-direction of funding to countries in greater financial need (Chow 2010). The Global Fund cancelled Round 11 and ended its new funding to China. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, USAID, and other donors have shifted their focus from supporting China\u2019s own response to HIV/AIDS to a \u201cChina in the World\u201d orientation, focused on how to work with China as a development partner or source for lower-cost drugs in Africa and elsewhere. An unfortunate consequence of the drop-off in funding has been the drying up of support for China\u2019s NGO sector working on HIV/AIDS. After the Global Fund\u2019s Round 11 program to China was cancelled, the Chinese government announced that it would use domestic resources to substitute for cancelled Global Fund moneys and accelerated a process to contract directly with local NGOs for program implementation. But while some organizations have continued to operate with Chinese government support contracted locally by local CDCs who depend on them for outreach, many others, especially those working on advocacy rather than service delivery, have struggled to continue their missions. As an indication of how valued the NGO service contribution to the AIDS response now is in China, the Chinese government set up a special fund in 2015, exclusively for the support of NGOs to ensure their continued input. The Ministry of Finance allocated 30 million RMB, but Premier Li Keqiang felt this was insufficient, so he used his Premier Funds to add another 20 million RMB, for a total of 50 million RMB in 2015. The fund supports NGOs to do outreach work with the MSM, sex worker, drug user, and PLWH communities.",

The Foreign NGO law, which was passed in April 2016 and took effect in January 2017, shifted responsibility for foreign NGO oversight to the Ministry of Public Security from the Ministry of Civil Affairs and significantly increased the bureaucratic and regulatory requirements for all not-for-profit foreign organizations that work in China or provide funding to China-based organizations. Restricting foreign funding to Chinese NGOs has adversely affected the operations of the domestic advocacy NGOs even further. And, in light of the reductions in foreign donor funding in recent years, this could have serious negative consequences for China\u2019s HIV/AIDS response. Many of the organizations highlighted in this chapter that have played a critical role in advocacy and research had already felt the impact of the draft law, which was issued in 2015. In many cases, their foreign funders retreated for fear of being out of legal compliance. Yirenping, an NGO that has worked on employment discrimination against HIV and hepatitis B virus patients, had already been targeted by those tasked with enforcing this new law, most likely because of the foreign donor that supported its efforts. This law is one of a suite of new State Security-oriented legislation recently passed. The NGO law, while primarily aimed at preventing foreign-funded civil society groups from organizing political movements that might challenge the authority of the current regime, has spilled over into work in the social sectors, even in areas like HIV/AIDS which is fully supported by the government. The type of donor-supported efforts that led to the development of NGOs and the expansion of their roles in China\u2019s AIDS response for stigmatized groups like MSM and criminalized populations like commercial sex workers and PWID is threatened at a time when access to these marginalized populations is essential for achieving national goals.",

            "text": "Global experience demonstrates, that it is nearly impossible to achieve success in AIDS prevention without actively involving the communities themselves in efforts to reach their members. In China, government is the almost exclusive provider of public services, and since 2002, the China CDC has done an admirable job of tackling many sensitive AIDS prevention challenges and achieved many successes in controlling and responding to the epidemic. The government frequently contracts with NGOs for service provision for marginalized groups, especially MSM and PLWH, and has helped to begin normalizing the sector and formalizing the partnerships. However, although government effort is necessary, it is not sufficient to achieve success in HIV prevention among MSM and other marginalized and stigmatized groups. NGOs representing these groups are becoming less able to play the roles required of them because of the tightening political situation for Chinese NGOs accompanying the new Foreign NGO law and reductions in overseas funding. These organizations, which are critical for reaching communities throughout China, are plagued by the lack of core financing (as opposed to project funding) especially in recent years and often depend too much on volunteers rather than staff. Many groups have struggled to grow beyond their original vision and leadership and often compete for the more limited donor and government funds that trickle down to groups on the frontline of the epidemic. This situation is likely to worsen and may lead to the demise of some important groups that are unable to secure funding. To some degree, financial competition contributes to a lack of cohesion in the sector, further constrained by a regulatory environment that prohibits establishment of branches in different places (except for the GONGO sector) or transnational networking. However, competition and poor capacity among China\u2019s NGOs should not be used as an excuse to dismiss their value and necessity. Without genuine capacity, core funding, networking, and better governance, these organizations are unable to play their much-needed role. True partnership of these NGOs with government, the main service provider, architect, and enabler of policies and programs in China, is essential. Without active engagement of China\u2019s AIDS NGOs in China\u2019s HIV/AIDS response, the Chinese government\u2019s effort to control the AIDS epidemic will be only partially successful.
