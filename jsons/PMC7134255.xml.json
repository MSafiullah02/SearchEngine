Increased resource availability, awareness, attention, and formalized responsibility facilitate an increase in BPM success [3]. Though BPM has yielded some success, and despite significant organizational investments in BPM activity, BPM still experiences implementation and expansion challenges [4]. These challenges relate to organizations\u2019 inadequate grasp of their methodologies. Additionally, organizations often apply ad-hoc, instead of organization-wide (org-wide), enhancements that yield more effective and longer-term results [4, 5]. It, therefore, is apparent that an understanding of the various aspects that facilitates BPM success remains vital [5, 6]. To this end, BPM provides a governance structure that regulates the modernization of always-transforming businesses and org-wide value chains [2].",

Secondly, the researcher rationalized the BPM governance categories, themes, and sub-themes identified in the BPM governance frameworks found in the literature. These frameworks are (1) the de Bruin and Rosemann BPM Maturity Model [13]; (2) the Bhat and Fernandez elements of BPM Governance [16], and (3) the Spanyi BPM governance framework checklist [8]. Next, the researcher mapped the six literature-derived BPM governance categories, along with their themes and elements, to the five capability areas contained in the de Bruin and Rosemann BPM Maturity Model\u2019s governance factor [13]. The five BPM governance capability areas are (1) Process Management (PM) Decision-making; (2) PM Roles and Responsibilities; (3) PM Metrics and Performance Linkage; (4) PM Standards; and (5) PM Controls. Lastly, the researcher removed the BPM governance elements as they were useful to the framework construction only for categorising the corresponding challenges.",

The study embraced a subjective ontological stance and an interpretivist epistemological stance, which promoted understanding the research participants, their interactions, and their impact on the world around them [21]. The purpose of the study was descriptive, and qualitative research methods were employed. By using a case study research strategy, the study described the BPM governance challenges experienced and perceived by the case organization, as well as the complexities that influence these experiences [22, 23]. The single case study organization was known as InvestCo throughout the study to ensure anonymity. At the time, the primary author had been in the case organization\u2019s service for many years. Thus, the author had a fair understanding of its strategic objectives and culture. InvestCo was selected for this research study because (1) it is considered one of the largest private sector investment managers in South Africa with an employee count of over 500 and several branches over the breadth of the country; (2) it has not officially adopted BPM; (3) though its maturity level was low, it had established process management practices.",

The analysis took place concurrently with the data collection [24]. The secondary data was analysed in the same wasy as the primary data. The first phase included reading and rereading the data and noting initial ideas. The second phase resulted in initial coding. In the third phase the codes where collated into themes and in the fourth phase the themes were iteratively reviewing by re-reading all text. The final two phases included naming and renaming themes and selecting vivid extracts for each theme. The literature-derived theoretical framework merely served to guide the study and categorization of themes that emerged from the data.

New themes not found in the literature are indicated with an asterisk. While the dominance of certain challenges can\u2019t be simplisticly assigned to the number of text references it does give an indication. The interpretation of the findings also supported that the dominant challenge categories were the lack of PM controls (C1-6) with 79 text references and a lack of PM process roles and responsibilities (C7-13) with 45 text references. The dominant challenge was the difficulty with capacity constraints (C1) with 35 text references. No evidence was found to support the PM Decision-Making category within the case organisation. To mitigate potential bias in the grouping of the challenge, interviewees were consulted during the latter part the analysis process. As most of the organization\u2019s functions require specialized skills, the recruitment and retention policies require closer scrutiny to assess how they can aid in reducing the challenges experienced in this area. The lack of BP documentation standards challenge is brought about by a lack of organizational policies and results in inconsistent standards applied by individuals.

This empirical study contributes to the BPM and BPM governance body of research in two ways. The study contributes to practice in that its comprehensive BPM governance theoretical framework, together with the literature-derived BPM governance elements framework could hold great value for future top management BPM and BPM governance-related decision-making in financial services and similar organizations.

The literature review identified that research gaps remain concerning BPM governance challenges-focused research. South Africa was the deliberate focus as the literature review indicated that a comprehensive examination of the governance challenges constraining BPM had not yet been conducted in the global context, developing context, or the South African context. Therefore, we encourage researchers and practitioners to conduct further empirical studies of the same or similar phenomena, using different research paradigms.
