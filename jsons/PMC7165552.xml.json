The World Health Organization and Center for Disease Control define droplets as being >5 \u03bcm and airborne pathogen transmission (APT) to occur from desiccated droplets (droplet nuclei) <5 \u03bcm in size, but there is still discussion about the size criterion of a droplet (Gralton et al., 2011; Nicas et al., 2005).

The impact of projectiles is important when a susceptible person is in close proximity to the infectious person. Measuring airborne pathogens documents that an airborne exposure may have occurred. Assessing disease outcomes documents that transmission occurred (possibly through numerous routes). In this paper we refer to APT as a measure of exposure. However, in most of the epidemiological studies we reviewed, they document disease outcome, which implies pathogen transmission occurred. We did not encounter any study that reported a measurement of both of these parameters. We acknowledge that documentation of airborne exposure and disease outcome does not quantify the contribution of specific modes of transmission, but given the difficulty of measuring these contributions, data on airborne exposure, outcomes, and how HVAC system characteristics affect exposure can provide meaningful insights about risk of airborne transmission, associations with outcomes, and potential control strategies.",

In attempting to assess the impact of HVAC systems on APT, there are large challenges in identifying and quantifying those factors that can impact APT and in measuring an impact given all of the other transmission pathways that occur simultaneously. A limited number of epidemiologic studies that have attempted to specifically address the role of one or more HVAC\u2010related factors on APT are identified in this review. In the following discussion, the strengths and weaknesses of each study are addressed. Given the complexities of APT and the wide variety of HVAC systems, it should be understood that no one study will answer the general question as to the role of HVAC systems in APT. At best, a given study will be able to address one or very few HVAC factors and one or very few diseases. This review is not intended to criticize the studies that have been conducted but rather is intended to evaluate them in a way that makes it possible to see what was learned from them about how to assess the impact of mechanical ventilation on APT in future studies. It should be understood that it is one thing to identify desired features and methodologies; however, resource constraints are almost universally a limiting factor in epidemiologic studies.",

An exception was the investigation of a respiratory infection outbreak in an overcrowded Houston jail by Hoge et al. (1994). The case\u2013control and cohort studies began after two inmates died on the same day of pneumococcal sepsis. The first 25 case patients hospitalized were enrolled in a case\u2013control study. For each case, three inmates living in the same cellblock were randomly selected as controls. The jail had a constant volume, recirculated air HVAC system operating at maximum capacity; 20% of the total volume of air delivered was outdoor air and 80% was recirculated. Each cellblock had its own recirculation system. Outdoor air ventilation was evaluated by measuring CO2 levels and airflow rates to the living areas of the jail. Carbon dioxide levels were measured using detector tubes [this method usually results in high potential errors and is not recommended, Sepp\u00e4nen et al. (1999)]. Airflow was measured in the center of duct using a thermal anemometer. There is no mention of a traverse of the duct to show that the velocity at the center was a valid estimate of average velocity (recommended). Volume of outside air delivered per person was calculated but there is no mention if it came from CO2 levels or from an assumed percentage of outside air from total supply air. The respiratory infection incidence rate was highest among inmates in cellblocks with the highest CO2 levels and the lowest volume of outside air delivered by the HVAC system. This study showed the impact of occupancy and OA ventilation rate per person on disease outcome and investigators concluded that overcrowding and inadequate ventilation contributed to the outbreak. It was an advance forward compared to other studies during this period because it used quantitative measures collected close to the time of investigation.",

There was a trend of increasing risk for complaints of a sore throat and cough by troops who were less exposed to the outdoor environment, with troops sleeping in AC buildings having the highest risk of developing these symptoms.

Incidence rates of febrile acute respiratory disease were significantly higher among trainees in modern barracks that had lower design outdoor air change rates due to energy conservation measures. An important strength of this study was the standardized diagnosis and treatment of disease across locations and conditions of the study.

This study performed an assessment of the HVAC system by measuring air change rates using a tracer gas method with pure CO2 and noting the direction of airflow at all doors, windows, and vents with smoke tubes. Note that this measurement accounted for both mechanical ventilation and any infiltration. The percentage of rooms on each nursing unit that met the current ventilation standard was also calculated for each hospital, with results varying from 19 to 87% of rooms meeting the standard for a given hospital. Researchers concluded that in Canadian hospitals that admitted at least six patients with TB annually, tuberculin conversion among HCW was strongly associated with inadequate ventilation in general patient rooms defined as <2.0 air changes per hour (ACH). It was also associated with type and duration of work. Of note is that researchers accounted for community exposure as well, which would be an important confounder. Ventilation measurements and inspection were performed in 339 patient care areas. One of the largest limitations of the study is that ventilation was assessed based on tracer gas measurements of air change rate during the course of 1 day. Although the type of HVAC system is not mentioned, it is likely that air change rates varied significantly throughout the year, especially considering that the hospitals were located in areas with extreme outdoor conditions. For this reason, a single day of measurements may not represent the HVAC system operation over the course of 3 years, the time period in which tuberculin conversions were documented. Additionally, ACH can be an unclear measure if the composition of the dilution air is unknown (outside air, air from an adjacent space, recirculated air from other spaces, etc.). It can refer to the outdoor air change rate if dilution air comes solely from outdoors, but in many cases the composition of the dilution air is unknown.",

It was an intervention because they blindly varied the outdoor air supply dampers. They calculated the CO2 concentration differential by subtracting the nightly background from the daily average levels. There was no association between CO2 differential at the values studied with sick leave, albeit differential concentrations were relatively low, ranging from 37\u2013250 ppm. They hypothesized that the buildings had an excess of OA ventilation capacity relative to the volume of office space and number of workers. Researchers estimated that <450 ppm above background, it was unlikely that rhinovirus would be transmitted from one office worker to another via the airborne route and for that reason no association between CO2 and sick leave was found. Some of the methods developed in this study were used in the Myatt et al. (2004) study. Conducting a preliminary study of methods prior to implementing a larger study is a good approach, as this will ensure enough power to see an association, improve data collection methods, and identify any possible confounding. Power is the probability that the null hypothesis is rejected if a specific alternative hypothesis is true. It is a measure of Type II error and is influenced by other factors such as significance level (Type I error) and sample size.",

It is one of the strongest study designs to date, because it used a direct airborne exposure measurement; air filters were collected for rhinovirus detection and analyzed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques. While the direct exposure measurement of an airborne pathogen is an improvement from an indirect exposure measurement such as CO2, it is the outcome of infection in conjunction with the presence of airborne pathogens that best informs the risk assessment of aerosol transmission. Ultimately, clinical confirmation of infection would be ideal for outcome measurements, but even outcome measurements with relatively high uncertainty such as absence data would be better than no measurement. Three Polaroid Corporation office buildings were assessed over 20 months. Occupancy was recorded every week. Outdoor air supply dampers were artificially and blindly adjusted every three months to reduce or increase the outdoor air supply and thereby extend the range of CO2. This was a unique approach to \u2018experimenting\u2019 with the outdoor airflow rates. Carbon dioxide differential above the background was used according to the methods of Myatt et al. (2002). A significant positive relationship was found between the frequency of virus detection in air samples and average CO2 concentrations greater than 100 ppm above background. In addition, one sample from a nasal lavage contained single\u2010stranded conformational polymorphism assay band patterns that were an exact match to a building air sample collected during the same week, indicating that the same virus was found on both samples. This suggests that occupants in buildings with low outdoor air supply may have an increased risk of exposure to infectious droplet nuclei emanating from a fellow building occupant. The methods used in Myatt et al. (2004) provide a good starting point for protocols to measure exposure using air sampling in which RNA is extracted from air filters and amplified using PCR.",

They did an inspection of the hospital HVAC system after the outbreak, measuring the airflow rates, velocities, temperatures, and relative humidity (RH) at all supply diffusers and exhaust grilles in the ward. A subsequent study simulated the bioaerosol dispersion in the hospital ward using computational fluid dynamics and provided a more detailed description of the HVAC system (Li et al., 2005). The air change rate was found to be 7.8 ACH for the entire ward; but it was not reported whether this was the outdoor or supply air change rate, and methods for determining ACH were not described. Based on the measurement methods and presence of recirculation, we believe the reported ACH is likely the supply air change rate. It was found that the supply and exhaust airflow rates were imbalanced, with some supply diffusers and exhaust grilles not functioning properly. The index patient's cubicle was found to have the highest supply flow rate, while the adjacent exhaust grille had the lowest flow rate among all four functional exhaust grilles in the ward. It is possible that this imbalance in the supply and exhaust airflow rates promoted the dispersion of infectious aerosol from the index patient's cubicle to other hospital areas. Since this study was for only one building, the measurement approach could be more comprehensive in nature. An issue was that they could not collect measurements at the time of outbreak, so it was done four months later, in July. The outbreak was in March, so a subsequent comparison of seasonal differences in ventilation performance would have been important since spring and summer weather in Hong Kong can be quite different and thus the outdoor air supply may vary significantly depending on design. The design of the system supplying air to the ward was not reported (i.e., variable vs. constant air volume), so it is possible that supply airflow also varied based on factors such as heat loads.",

They categorized the barracks according to age, construction, and HVAC system configuration and then assessed disease prevalence in each category of barrack. Results showed that occupancy affected risk of ARI transmission and the resulting prevalence rate ratios suggest that there was a significant risk of airborne ARI transmission through HVAC systems. Higher rates of infection were found in the systems with both higher HVAC contact populations and less access to operable windows. Depending on the HVAC configuration, average HVAC contact population may be a useful parameter to include in future epidemiologic studies.

Outdoor air ventilation rate per person was calculated with a mass balance model that used the indoor CO2 equilibrium concentration minus the outdoor value. The analysis assumed well\u2010mixed conditions, and that steady state was reached for CO2. The steady\u2010state approximation is particularly questionable as simple transient mass balances indicate that steady state is unlikely to be reached during the time period in which the students were continuously in the classroom. While the lack of true steady\u2010state conditions may limit the accuracy of the OA ventilation rate calculations, the CO2 levels measured provide a good indication of actual instantaneous exposure to exhaled air. Additionally, 37% of classrooms studied were ventilated naturally from window opening, not mechanically. These classrooms were not likely to have a fixed daily outdoor air ventilation rate, and ventilation rate estimates from CO2 concentrations may have introduced more error than mechanically ventilated spaces that have far less transient and dynamic airflows.",

Implausible indoor concentrations were excluded from analyses.

Myatt et al. (2004), Sun et al. (2011), Shendell et al. (2004), and Mendell et al. (2013) used indoor\u2013outdoor CO2 differences to estimate the contribution of outdoor air. Menzies et al.

Tracer gas decay only provides an estimate of the outdoor air ventilation rate at the time it was performed. Many researchers have cautioned against the use of CO2 to estimate ventilation rates (e.g., Sepp\u00e4nen et al., 1999). CO2 methods do not always just measure the outdoor air component of ventilation. If the zone of measurement is not the entire building, then the zone may have dilution from other areas of the building, such as infiltration through connecting doorways. In this case the calculated ventilation rate is a dilution rate not an outdoor airflow rate.

At a minimum, there is the question of whether it is outside air or total supply air that is being measured.

Inadequate characterization of ventilation has been the Achilles heel of many of the epidemiologic studies conducted to date and adequately quantifying ventilation rates has been a difficult challenge even when the team included members with detailed HVAC system and related measurements knowledge.

A quantitative meta\u2010analysis is intended to combine estimates from multiple studies of the same exposure and health outcome, considering the individual studies as simply repetitions of the same study with randomly varying findings around a true value of the association. The design of a study included in a meta\u2010analysis is important; a meta\u2010analysis of badly designed studies will result in biased estimates, with the direction of the bias depending on the flaws in the study. For example, an improved study design would use representative sampling, such as random, systematic, stratified, and cluster sampling, or a combination of these. Note that a meta\u2010analysis will usually include studies of differing quality, and can usefully see if the better designed studies are more consistent when the weaker studies are excluded. A research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted are smaller, when effect sizes are smaller, and where there is greater flexibility in designs, and outcomes (Ioannidis, 2005). Additionally, HVAC system characteristics and measurement methods should be reported in sufficient detail for proper interpretation of results and use in future meta\u2010analyses. Clarity of reported data and measurement methods is essential to the success of future meta\u2010analyses.",

            "text": "Some progress has been made in understanding the role of mechanical ventilation and APT in the past 20 years. Much more remains to be done. The current available studies in buildings are mostly observational analytic or etiologic epidemiologic studies; although observational, they were designed to explore causal connections. While an advantage of such studies is that they reflect real\u2010world conditions, they afford the least control over the multiple variables that may be involved. Observational studies cannot positively establish causality. These are good studies to explore hypotheses, but intervention studies are needed to confirm a causal relationship. In many cases, however, observational epidemiology is considered sufficient to establish likely causality because many epidemiological questions cannot be answered by conducting experimental studies. The weight of the data implies that HVAC system factors in buildings have a role in APT; however, more studies need to be completed, with the eventual goal of a meta\u2010analysis to integrate results. We specifically recommend that individual studies should be designed in a way aimed at future meta\u2010analyses of key relationships so that all study methods are focused on these relationships of interest and also include parallel measurements to other such studies so they can be combined.",

            "text": "Of course as more studies are completed, and meta\u2010analyses are conducted, the weight of evidence may be enough to establish a causal link between building factors and risk of transmission; for example, lower outdoor air ventilation rates result in higher incidence of influenza. Confirmation of these findings by prospective, preferably experimental studies using detailed HVAC parameter, exposure, and outcome measurements is needed. The study of buildings lends itself well to experimental studies; however such studies are difficult and expensive, especially with randomization implemented and blind interventions. Interventions could be made on various HVAC\u2010related parameters, including outdoor air rates, supply air rates, humidity, or control technologies such as UV germicidal lamps, or filter type and rating. We need better\u2010powered evidence from larger studies and meta\u2010analyses. There is also a need for more studies with strong measurement methods of building characteristics, exposures, and outcomes, which can be greatly facilitated by increased collaboration between epidemiologists and engineers. Large\u2010scale evidence should be targeted for research questions where the pre\u2010study probability is considerably high, so that a significant research finding would be considered definitive (Ioannidis, 2005). The pre\u2010study probability in this case does seem high, given the studies completed to date, so that a well\u2010designed well\u2010funded study should result in clear evidence. Ioannidis states the large\u2010scale evidence is also particularly indicated when it tests major concepts. The concept in question is a broad one \u2013 what is the causal association between mechanical ventilation and APT, so in fact it is a worthwhile endeavor to pursue.",

It is generally believed and accepted that HVAC system factors can and do impact APT so establishing causality is mostly a matter of confirming the obvious. Quantitative relationships between HVAC factors and APT are needed for effective design and operation of HVAC systems. For example, how much outdoor air ventilation (at a given recirculation filter rating) is needed for a classroom with a given occupancy to avoid elevated disease outcomes? Thus, additional epidemiologic studies as well as meta\u2010analyses will establish the causality that is needed to focus on providing definitive quantitative relationships.",
