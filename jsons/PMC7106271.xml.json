            "text": "It is well known that the genetic code chooses 64 codons to represent 20 standard amino acids and stop signals. These alternative codons for the same amino acid are termed as synonymous codons. Although synonymous mutations tend to occur in the third base position, the cases can be interchanged without altering the primary sequence of the protein product. Some reports indicate that synonymous codons are not chosen equally and randomly both within and between genomes (Dittmar et al., 2006, Grantham et al., 1980, Lloyd and Sharp, 1992, Martin et al., 1989, Xie et al., 1998). In general, translation selection in nature and compositional constraints under the mutational pressure are thought to be the two major factors accounting for codon usage variation among genomes in various organisms (Gu et al., 2004, Karlin and Mr\u00e1zek, 1996, Lesnik et al., 2000, Sharp et al., 1986, Zhong et al., 2007, Zhou et al., 2005, Zhou et al., 2006). In some RNA viruses, compared with translation selection in nature, mutation pressure plays an important role in synonymous codon usage pattern (Gu et al., 2004, Levin and Whittome, 2000, Jenkins and Holmes, 2003).",

            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is an enveloped, single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus which is classified into the order Nidovirales of family Arteriviridae (Benfield et al., 1992, Cavanagh, 1997). Based on serological characteristics, there are the two main serotypes of PRRSV, namely the Northern American isolate (US) and the European isolate (EU) (Bautista et al., 1993, Collins et al., 1992, Meng et al., 1995, Wensvoort et al., 1991). In addition to differences between both serotypes of the viruses, there is obvious genetic variation within PRRSVs, as confirmed by measure of the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the viruses. The PRRSV genome contains ORF1a, encoding papain-like cysteine protease, ORF1b, encoding RNA dependent RNA polymerase, ORF2-6, encoding envelop proteins, and ORF7, encoding the nucleocapsid protein (Conzelmann et al., 1993, Meulenberg et al., 1993). The PRRSV can infect swine population and lead to a series of clinical signs, including high mortality, reproductive failure, post-weaning pneumonia and growth reduction (Keffaber, 1989, Loula, 1991). It is reported that PRRSV could give rise to prolonged viremia and enable its replication in macrophages, and lead to persistent infections (Plagemann and Moennig, 1992). However, little information about codon usage pattern of PRRSV genome including the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) and codon usage bias (CUB) in the process of their evolution are available. In this study, the key genetic determinants of codon usage index in PRRSV were examined.",

A plot of the (f\u20321) and the (f\u20322) of each ORF in PRRSV is shown in Fig. S1. It appeared to be a little complex with some overlapping plots of ORF1a to ORF7. The plots of ORF1a and ORF1b which can produce viral nonstructural proteins aggregated highly, however, the plots of the rest scattered to different extents (Fig. S1). It was clear that the plots of ORF4-7 were far from each other obviously, implying that the functions of differential viral products played a role in codon usage pattern. The ORF1a, ORF4, ORF5 and ORF7 could distinguish US and EU serotypes obviously, and these plots reflected codon usage pattern corresponding to each ORF (Fig. S2). It is probably been suggested during the evolution of PRRSV, the function of viral proteins enabled PRRSV genome to shape the characteristic of the US and the EU serotypes of PRRSV. The ORF1a could reflect the conserved pattern of synonymous codon usage between the two serotypes compared with ORF4, 5 and 7. This phenomenon reflected that synonymous codon usage pattern of ORF1a was relatively conserved due to the function of nonstructural protein of PRRSV, in contrast, due to the functions of structural proteins, the codon usage patterns of ORF4, 5 and 7 for structural proteins were relative variable. However, the scattered plots of ORF3 reflected that the two main serotypes had a common characteristic of synonymous codon usage pattern, namely, the plots failed to distinguish the two virus serotypes obviously. It suggested that the viral product encoded by ORF3 of different serotypes of PRRSV had a slight ability to identify between US and EU serotypes.",

However, it was observed that the relationship between (C3\n + G3)% and (C + G)% did not reveal some special features, namely it did not reflect the real variation of C3% or G3%.

In detail, it was apparent that positive correlation existed among the nucleotide contents (i.e., A% and A3%) (p\n < 0.01), however, there were three different correlation degrees including positive correlation, negative correlation or non-correlation among the nucleotides. Further, A3% has no correlation with C% or G%, suggesting nucleotide constraint can influence codon usage of the nucleotide A at the synonymous codon; the fluctuation of U3% can be affected by A%, C% and G%, respectively, and C3% is not related to G%, they does not indicate some special feature; however, G3% has a strong positive correlation with A% and non-correlation with C%, indicating (C + G)% and (C3\n + G3)% may not reflect some true feature of synonymous codon usage as well (Table 4\n). In addition, the (f\u20321) and (f\u20322) values were compared with nucleotide composition of each sample (Table 5\n). Although the codon usage patterns in different strains appeared to be related to (C3\n + G3)% to a slight extent, correlation analysis has been carried out to find significant correlation between nucleotide compositions and synonymous codon usage to a certain extent. In addition, there is no obvious relationship between codon usage indices (f\u20321 values) and the length of different ORFs, for example there is no significant difference among codon usage indices for ORF1a, ORF1b and ORF2 (p\n > 0.05), implying that the different length of genes did not account for codon usage variation of ORFs in PRRSV. Taken together, these analyses indicate that nucleotide compositions play a role in the pattern of codon usage.

It is known that ORF5 which encodes the major envelope glycoprotein (GP5) is one of the main immunogenic proteins of PRRSV and is the leading target for the development of the genetic engineering vaccines against PRRS. However, due to striking genetic and antigenic variability among different PRRSV isolates, GP5 of a strain has a negative effect on the cross-protection efficiency against heterologous PRRSV strains (Kim and Yoon, 2008, Meng, 2000). The synonymous codon usage pattern of ORF1a or ORF5 has the ability to distinguish between US and EU serotypes. To some degree, it seems that codon usage variation of ORF1a has a better ability to distinguish strain types than that of ORF5, and the latter has a remarkable characteristic of genetic variability within both homologous serotype and heterologous serotypes. However, the synonymous codon usage pattern of ORF3 does not group strains into US or EU serotype obviously, possibly suggesting that GP3 contains a common biological function in both serotypes. The result is consistent with some viewpoints about GP3 of PRRSV (Meulenberg et al., 1995). One possible explanation is that biological function of different viral products is developed by mutational pressure, rather than natural selection. It is also reported that there was a relationship between geographical location of sample origin and the genetic diversity of PRRSV (Stadejek et al., 2006). In this study, although synonymous codon usage variation fails to reflect that a geographical factor, the index has an obvious effect on codon usage pattern. This result is in agreement with the report by Pesch et al. (2005).",

To reveal the main force driving codon usage variation, it was found that codon usage bias was strong correlated with overall genomic (G + C) content, implying that composition constraint under mutational pressure rather than natural selection for specific coding triplets (Shackelton et al., 2006). Naya et al. (2001) found that in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii genome with high (G + C) content, there was no evidence that composition constraint played a role in shaping codon usage pattern. The results indicated that there were two main forces, namely, natural selection and mutational pressure, existing in the process of evolution. In this study, each base composition at the third position of synonymous codon was always correlated to the other base composition (Table 4). The fact that (G + C) content varies in a similar way at all codon positions is usually assumed to be the result of mutational bias. The fact that (G + C) content varies in a similar way at all codon positions is usually assumed to be the result of mutational pressure. A general mutational pressure, which affects the whole genome would certainly account for the majority of the codon usage has been reported among some RNA viruses. Since mutation rates of RNA viruses are much higher than those DNA viruses (Jenkins and Holmes, 2003), it is understandable that mutation pressure plays a key role in shaping the synonymous codon usage pattern in different ORFs of the 13 PRRSV strains included in this study. In addition, the general association between codon usage indices and composition constraint shows that mutational pressure plays an important role in determining codon usage variation of PRRSV, which is supported by the highly significant correlation between codon usage indices (f\u20321) and A3%, U3%, G3%, C3% (Table 5). Although the codon usage indices (f\u20321) is strong correlated with composition constraint (C3\n + G3)% has stronger correlation with f\u20322 values than f\u20321, implying that it has no real correlation with codon usage indices. The fluctuation of (C3\n + G3)% does not reflect C3% and G3% and (C3\n + G3)% may not always present the degree of composition constraint, so the fluctuation of each nucleotide composition needs to be analyzed further. Sequence analysis indicated PRRSV achieve evolution through random mutation and intragenic recombination (Kapur et al., 1996, Meng et al., 1995, Murtaugh et al., 1995, Nelsen et al., 1999). Taken together, mutational pressure is one of the main factors responsible for the variation of synonymous codon usage among ORF coding sequences in PRRSV.",

            "text": "The codon usage bias for synonymous codon in different ORFs of PRRSV shows different feature in the study. Among these ORFs, each includes some amino acids with strong selective discrepancy and some synonymous codons for a particular amino acid has been used preferentially. It seems that the codon usage discrepancy for some synonymous codon may serve as a potential genetic marker. Nielsen et al. (2001) examined the alternative of synonymous and non-synonymous amino acids in ORF1 of PRRSV and pointed out that there was a stronger selective pressure for amino acid conservation during spread in host animal. Storgaard et al. (1999) found that non-synonymous nucleotide mutations in ORF7 of PRRSV were not stronger than ORF5. These findings suggest that gene function and mutational pressure likely affect codon usage variation. In addition, the effect of natural translation selection in shaping synonymous codon usage is not observed in this study and this is consistent with those previous reports (Biro, 2008, Gu et al., 2004, Levin and Whittome, 2000, Zhou et al., 2005). These results probably assist us in understanding various factors influencing evolution of PRRSV.",
