Due to the inaccuracy of the coronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) and high frequency of homologous RNA recombination, emergence of variant strains, genotypes and serotypes of IBV is constantly reported [6], [7], [8], [9], and at least 30 serotypes have been identified worldwide.

Previous studies have shown that at least six genotypes (CH I\u2013CH VI) are prevalent in China, and the QX-like (CH I) genotype, accounting for more than 60% of newly isolated IBV strains in the past 10 years, have become predominant [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]. Current vaccine strains used in China (H120, H52, W93 and Ma5) belong to the Mass genotype and are evolutionarily distant from QX-like genotype strains [15], [16]. Although various live-attenuated and inactivated vaccines derived from Mass genotype strains have been widely used in chicken farms, their efficacies are poor, and IB disease outbreaks occur frequently in vaccinated chicken flocks. Therefore, developing a novel live-attenuated vaccine from a Chinese QX-like nephropathogenic IBV strain is necessary.",

Chickens inoculated with YX10p75 or YX10p90 were 100% protected without morbidity and mortality, indicating that these two passage strains preserved immunogenicity and could provide protection against challenge with a homologous virulent virus. Excessive passaging has been reported to decrease immunogenicity and lead to poor protective effects. These outcomes were confirmed in the current study, as the chickens inoculated with YX10p102 showed morbidity and mortality rates of 41.6% (5/12) and 8.3% (1/12), respectively. The high morbidity and mortality of the H120 vaccinated group and the positive control group also illustrated the poor protective effects of Mass-type vaccines against challenge with QX-like isolated strains. In the evaluation of efficacy, the ELISA antibody positive rates of all experimental group including p75 and p90 group were low post-vaccination, but the protection provided by p75 and p90 strain was effective. This finding was predictable and typical for chickens vaccinated against IBV. Humoral immunity is not a determining factor for protection against IBV infection, and circulating antibody titers may not positively correlate with anti-IBV effects [24]. Local antibody responses and cell-mediated immunity both play significant roles in protection against IBV infection [25]. However, surveillance of specific IgG antibodies remains an important method for evaluating immune responses to an IBV vaccine [26].",

YX10p90 provided varying degrees of cross-protection against the major Chinese genotype strains. The YX10p90 immunized chickens showed effective protection (91.7\u2013100%) against CH I genotype strains (YX10p5, LZ12 and GL12), but partial protection (58.3\u201366.7%) against CH III and CH V genotype strains (YL12 and ZS12).

The polyvalent vaccine A prepared in this study contained the combination of strains YX10p90, H120 and 4/91. Compared with the two commercial polyvalent vaccines B and C, polyvalent vaccine A provided higher levels of renal protection and clinical protection. Importantly, the polyvalent vaccine formulation expanded the level of cross-protection over that individual vaccine strains achieved. However, it was reported that the use of polyvalent live vaccine may contribute to the variation and recombination of IBV, and bring about more complex IBV epidemic [15], [27], [28], therefore, the biological safety of polyvalent live vaccine need to be further verified.",

            "text": "Correlating pathogenicity with specific viral gene sequences is a major focus of IBV research. The S1 glycoprotein plays an important role in tissue tropism, attachment to the host cell and induction of neutralizing antibodies. Therefore, many studies on IBV pathogenicity have been limited to the S1 gene [1], [29], [30]. Several amino acid changes at the N-terminus of the S protein have been shown to result in the change of tissue tropism and virulence of a coronavirus [19], [31], [32]. With the development of reverse genetic manipulations, the S1 glycoprotein was found to not affect the virulence of IBV [33], [34]. In previous pathogenicity experiment of YX10p5 (date not shown), samples (kidney, trachea, lung, thymus, bursa and proventriculus) were collected from diseased and dead chickens for virus recovery. The kidney and trachea were the main tissues and organs for virus recovery rate and the recovery rate (100%) was much higher than other tissues. In this study, virus was always recovered from samples of kidney and trachea in virulence reversion test of YX10p90. It suggested that 26 amino acids substitutions, including 3 in S protein, and 110-bp deletion in 3\u2032-UTR do not alter main tissue tropism but attenuate the pathogenicity and virulence of IBV. Cavanagh et al. [35], [36] reported that gene 1 (replicase gene) of IBV is a determinant of pathogenicity. Huang and Wang [37] found a 49-bp deletion in the 3\u2032-UTR immediately downstream from the N protein at passage 76 of strain TW2296/95 that is not present in the pathogenic parent. Liu et al. [38] found a 109-bp deletion located 8 nucleotides downstream of the stop codon of the N gene in the 3\u2032-UTR during attenuation of QX-like IBV strain CK/CH/LHLJ/04V by passaging in fertilized SPF eggs. Notably, the length and location of the 110-bp deletion in the 3\u2032-UTR of YX10p90 was very similar to the 109-bp deletion during attenuation of QX-like IBV strain CK/CH/LHLJ/04V reported by Liu et al. [38]. It was noticed that YX10p102 strain was less capable to induce a protective immune response compared to p90 in efficacy test. Complete genome sequence analysis showed that there were 4 nucleotide differences between p90 and p102, and these differences could bring about 3 amino acid substitutions. It is speculated that these 3 amino acid substitutions may contribute to the further decrease of virulence and immunogenicity of YX10p102 strain. However, it is not easy to conclude that certain gene related to the virulence or immunogenicity of IBV, or certain nucleotide mutation could bring about attenuation. Identifying specific changes involved in the attenuation, virulence and immunogenicity of IBV will require further investigation by reverse genetics and animal studies to verify the exact function of the amino acid substitutions, insertion and deletion in the IBV genome.",

The efficacy test states that at least 80% of immunized chickens be free of clinical signs, the vaccine is considered to be effective. Based on our evaluations of the safety, efficacy and potential for reversion to virulence, the IBV strain of YX10p90 conforms to these guidelines of the CVP (2010), exhibiting a fine balance between attenuation and immunogenicity. Thus, YX10p90 may be considered as a vaccine candidate to prevent infection by the Chinese QX-like nephropathogenic IBV.",
