The study included postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive (and any HER2 status) early breast cancer (stage I-IIIA) who had been treated with NSAI (ie, either anastrozole or letrozole) for at least six months. Participants were recruited from five Spanish sites and one Swedish site during a routine follow-up visit between April 2015 and October 2016. Postmenopausal status was defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea, or 6 months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum FSH levels greater than 40 mIU/mL, or 6 weeks postsurgical bilateral oophorectomy, with or without hysterectomy. All patients had moderate-to-severe vaginal dryness according to the FDA guidelines for drug development in postmenopausal women (Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, CDER January 2003). A moderate symptom was considered if the symptom was present, bothersome and annoying, and a severe symptom was considered if the symptom was present, bothersome and annoying, and interfered with the normal activity. Other inclusion criteria were a score 0 or 1 in the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG), and an adequate bone marrow and organ function. Patients treated with another antitumoral therapy (excluding pamidronate or alendronate) and those who received vulvovaginal treatment in the 15 days before the study start, and/or had used hormones, natural (phytoestrogens) or herbal products to treat menopausal symptoms in the 3 months before the study start were excluded from the study. Other important exclusion criteria included the presence of postmenopausal uterine bleeding, vaginal bleeding of unknown etiology, and endometrial thickness greater than or equal to 4 mm; and history of other malignancy within 5 years of study entry (aside from nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma-in-situ of the uterine cervix adequately treated), thromboembolic disease or coagulopathies, severe cardiovascular or respiratory disease in the previous 6 months, renal impairment, Hepatitis B and/or C (with the exception of patients with normal hepatic function), and HIV infection. Patients who had received any investigational treatment for any condition or had participated in any clinical trial within 4 weeks of inclusion date were excluded from the study. All patients signed the written informed consent before starting the treatment, and the study protocol was approved by the Regulatory Authorities and applicable Ethics Committees of the participating countries.",

Vaginal symptoms (ie vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, and pruritus) and signs (ie mucosa with thinning or flattening of folds, and fragility and dryness of the mucosa) were rated by the patient (symptoms) and the investigator (signs) on a 4-point scale, where 0 indicated the absence of the sign/symptom and 3 indicated the symptom was considered very irritating and severe; scores 1 and 2 indicated mild and moderate signs/symptoms, respectively The vaginal pH was measured on the vaginal secretion using a reactive strip (pH 2.0-9.0). Vaginal maturation was assessed from two cytology samples (drawn from the bottom of the right and left vaginal sac, respectively), and were analyzed at a central laboratory (Centro Anatomopatol\u00f3gico, S.L., Madrid, Spain). For the cytological evaluation, the average percentages of parabasal, intermediate, and superficial cells were calculated twice on 100 consecutive cells. The maturation index was determined using the formula 0.2x (% parabasal) + 0.6x (% intermediate) + 1.0x (% superficial) (range 20-100).19 The FSFI is a 19-item questionnaire, composed of three multi-item functional subscales covering six domains (ie, desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain), developed specifically to assess sexual functioning in the research setting.20 An algorithm was used to determine domain scores and a composite full-scale score.",

Estrogen levels were determined at a central laboratory (Pharm-Analyt, Austria) at baseline and weeks 1, 3, 8, and 12. Due to the extremely low levels of estrogens expected, estriol, estradiol, and estrone were analyzed using a validated ultrasensitive liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method. Values below limit of quantification (1, 3 and 5 pg/ml) were considered 0.5, 1.5, and 2.5 pg/mL for estriol, estradiol, and estrone, respectively. FSH and LH were analyzed by chemiluminescent immunoassay at Laboratorios Echevarne, Spain at the same time points and, additionally, at the screening visit to assess their physiological variability. Determinations for a given participant were performed in the same batch. Other safety assessments included laboratory parameters (hematology, blood chemistry, and urine tests) and a physical and gynecological examination (breast and pelvic examination), performed at baseline and at weeks 3 and 12. All adverse events were recorded and graded according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. The causal relationship between the investigational product and the adverse event was assessed by the investigator using the Karch and Lasagna algorithm.21",

Results regarding the progression of signs and symptoms severity throughout the follow-up period were presented as both mean (SD) and median (IQR) to provide a comprehensive view of que quantitative change, which in some cases occurred in a narrow score range. Because of the high variability of physiological levels of gonadotropins, the change in these hormones was assessed by comparing the physiological variability (ie, difference between screening and baseline visits) and the in-treatment variability (ie, difference from baseline to 12-week treatment). The between-group differences in score change were compared using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney-U test, whereas differences between time points within each treatment group were compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test (results are presented as mean and SD) All analyses were performed using the statistical software SAS Enterprise Guide 5.1.",

Given that the 0.005% estriol gel is formulated as a highly hydrating gel with a true effect beyond the pure placebo effect, treatment with the gel alone (without hormones) was expected to have an effect on some of the symptoms and signs (ie temporal relief of vaginal dryness), similar to the lubricants and moisturizers indicated as first-line treatment for vaginal atrophy.2,4,8 Nevertheless, patients in the active arm experienced a greater improvement in vaginal dryness throughout the follow-up, likely due to the stimulation of maturation of the vaginal epithelium by the active hormone and its healing effect. Regarding sexual function, only the 0.005% estriol gel improved most domains and the total score of the FSFI questionnaire, whereas the placebo hydrating gel failed to improve sexual function. Given the predominant impact of NSAIs treatment on sexual function and consequently, well-being and quality of life, these findings suggest that the ultra-low 0.005% estriol vaginal gel may improve patients\u2019 quality of life in addition to alleviating GSM symptoms.25",

Some authors have reported an increased absorption in atrophic compared to estrogenized vaginal tissues and a differential expression of estrogen receptors in the vaginal walls of pre- and post-menopausal women.27,28 Although these observations likely rule out increased absorption of estriol by the well estrogenized epithelium and, consequently, safety concerns after prolonged treatment, long-term studies may be needed to assess the sustained safety and effectivity throughout the prescribed adjuvant treatment. It is also worth mentioning that the scarcity of previous data regarding the change of FSH in patients treated with estriol vaginal gels precluded a formal estimation of sample size; however, the results of a previous analysis of FSH change in these patients suggested that the size of our sample should be large enough to identify significant changes in FSH levels.24 Given that our results indicate that the 0.005% estriol gel preparation is effective and safe, further studies using a larger sample size (with a balanced randomization) to assess long-term effects are warranted.",
