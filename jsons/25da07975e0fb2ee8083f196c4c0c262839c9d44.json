Methods We retrospectively reviewed the initial chest CT data of 62 confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 patients (34 men, 28 women; age range 20-91 years old) who did not receive any antiviral treatment between January 21 and February 4, 2020, in Chongqing, China. Patients were assigned to the early-stage group (onset of symptoms within 4 days) or progressive-stage group (onset of symptoms within 4-7 days) for analysis. CT characteristics and the distribution, size, and CT score of pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities were assessed. Results In our study, the major characteristic of coronavirus disease 2019 was ground-glass opacity (61.3%), followed by ground-glass opacity with consolidation (35.5%), rounded opacities (25.8%), a crazy-paving pattern (25.8%), and an air bronchogram (22.6%). No patient presented cavitation, a reticular pattern, or bronchial wall thickening. The CT scores of the progressive-stage group were significantly greater than those of the early-stage group (p = 0.004). Conclusions Multiple ground-glass opacities with consolidations in the periphery of the lungs were the primary CT characteristic of coronavirus disease 2019.

Thus, we assigned patients to two groups according to the time of onset of symptoms to analyze the CT findings in earlystage and progressive-stage of COVID-19. In this study, 62 confirmed patients with COVID-19 underwent chest CT scans, and positive rate of detecting the pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities was 100%. In addition, the CT data in our study were obtained from the initial chest CT examination of patients who had not received any antiviral therapy; these results may better reflect the degree of viral infection and the immune system status before clinical intervention and provide an important basis for clinical classification, treatment strategy development, and prognosis prediction. In our study, the major characteristic of COVID-19 was GGO (61.3%), followed by GGO with consolidation (35.5%), rounded opacity (25.8%), a crazy-paving pattern (25.8%), and an air bronchogram (22.6%). In contrast, pulmonary fibrosis (1.6%) and pleural effusions (3.2%) were rare on chest CT images. These various CT findings are likely related to the complex pathological changes in the lungs of patients with COVID-19. Although pathological changes in the lung tissue of COVID-19 patients have not yet been studied, recent studies have reported that SARS-CoV-2 is closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, with approximately 79% homology with SARS-CoV and approximately 50% homology with MERS-CoV [17, 18] . Because the pathogenesis of viral infections in the same family may be similar, previous studies on coronaviruses may be helpful in understanding the various CT findings in COVID-19 patients based on similar pathological changes. In SARS patients, pathological changes include injury to pulmonary epithelial cells, hyaline membrane formation on in the inner wall of the alveoli, and a large number of tissue cells and mass thrombi formed by proliferative fibrous tissue that block the small airway and air cavity [19] . These pathological changes may be the main pathological basis of the CT findings, especially the GGO.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 70, "end": 74, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 75, "end": 78, "text": "11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 364, "end": 368, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1846, "end": 1850, "text": "[17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1851, "end": 1854, "text": "18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2370, "end": 2374, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Among all the CT findings, GGO was the most common one in both the early and progressive stages of COVID-19 and was characterized by multiple sized lesions, mainly distributed in the peripheral lung (96.8%).
