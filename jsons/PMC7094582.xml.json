Postmortem studies using immunofluorescence and molecular assays during this outbreak clearly showed that EV71 infected the central nervous system (Hsueh et al., 2000). Furthermore, isolates were extracted from the medulla oblongata and spinal cord (Chang et al., 1998, Shih et al., 2000). Due to the consequences of this and other EV71 outbreaks worldwide (McMinn, 2002), further studies of the mechanisms associated with EV71 infection are essential. Furthermore, a greater understanding of key pathways that are necessary for viral entry and replication may lead to novel therapies which may impact on the health of children worldwide.",

            "text": "An increasing number of viruses have been found to induce apoptosis at the late stages of infection. This process may be important in facilitating the spread of progeny virus to neighboring cells and for providing protection for the progeny virus against host enzymes and antibodies (Teodoro and Branton, 1997). However, viruses have also evolved diverse strategies to evade or delay the early onset of apoptosis. This affords a selective advantage to the virus, allowing it to replicate, spread, and maintain persistent infections (O'Brien, 1998, Roulston et al., 1999, Tortorella et al., 2000, Everett and McFadden, 2001). To increase cell survival and proliferation, the viruses target various intracellular signaling pathways (Teodoro and Branton, 1997), including MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt. For example, infection with coxsackievirus, an enterovirus related to EV71, results in activation of both of these survival pathways (Huttunen et al., 1998, Luo et al., 2002, Zhang et al., 2003). Furthermore, coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) triggers bimodal MAPK/ERK activation, in that initial binding of the virus causes first phase activation while the subsequent phase was elicited by viral replication (Luo et al., 2002). In addition, the PI3K/Akt pathway is also modulated during CVB3 infection (Zhang et al., 2003). Although the activation of these important pathways has been described for other enteroviruses, little is known regarding the action of EV71 on cellular signaling and survival.",

GSK-3, a ubiquitously expressed protein\u2013serine/threonine kinase, is inhibited by Akt phosphorylation in response to growth factor stimulation. In addition to glycogen synthase, GSK-3 phosphorylates a broad range of substrates, including several transcription factors and the translation initiation factor. These studies suggest that GSK-3 is involved in multiple cellular processes, including metabolism, proliferation, and differentiation (Woodgett, 2001). Additional targets of Akt that have been implicated in control of cell survival include apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (Kim et al., 2001), caspase-9 (Cardone et al., 1998), BAD (Franke and Cantley, 1997), Forkhead transcription factor (FHKR) (Brunet et al., 1999), and NF-\u03baB (Madrid et al., 2000).",

Growth-arrested Vero cells were infected with EV71 at an MOI of 5 for 1 h and cells were harvested at 0.5, 3 and 6 h pi. Akt activity was determined using an antibody to phosphorylated Akt. As shown in Fig. 1A and B, exposure of Vero cells to EV71 stimulated Akt activity, peaking as early as 0.5 h and sustaining at a high level until at least 6 h. The level of phosphorylation was clearly obvious at 10 min pi but peaked at 0.5 h pi (see Fig. 4A). Therefore, we chose 0.5 h pi as the early infection point for the following experiments. Upon EV71 infection at 0.5 h pi, a significant portion of Akt was concentrated locally on the plasma membrane as indicated by the arrow (Fig. 1C). The membrane translocation of Akt is crucial for phosphorylation and activation by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase, which is usually constitutively active in various cell types (reviewed in Chan et al. (1999)). We then determined whether this activation was a cell-specific phenomenon. The activation of Akt was examined in further two cell lines, MRC-5 and RD, infected with EV71 at the same MOI. The MRC-5 cells, a human embryonic lung cell line, showed the same activation kinetic as observed in the Vero cells (Fig. 1D and E). However, the RD cells, a human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line, did not respond to the EV71 infection even at 6 h pi (data not shown). This demonstrates cell-type-specific differences in the ability of EV71 to induce Akt phosphorylation. Furthermore, we investigated the possibility that PI3K was an upstream target in the activation of Akt by EV71, via the use of wortmannin, a potent and specific inhibitor of PI3K. Wortmannin blocked Akt phosphorylation effectively (Fig. 2B and C). The mock infection with the vehicle, DMSO, did not affect Akt phosphorylation (data not shown). Activation of PI3K and its downstream target, Akt, has been widely implicated in transmitting survival signals in response to a wide variety of stimuli in many different cell types. To determine whether PI3K/Akt activity was influenced by other proteins present in the media during virus preparation, we treated growth-arrested Vero cells with RD cell extract processed in an identical freeze\u2013thaw protocol to that used during virus propagation, but in the absence of virus. We did not observe significant modulation of Akt phosphorylation compared to that of the control (data not shown). Therefore, we believe that the activation of Akt is due to the direct interaction between virus and host cells. EV71 can activate the PI3K/Akt survival pathway in the early stage of infection. This may allow the virus to defend against the premature death of the host cell, maximizing virus progeny from a lytic infection and/or facilitating a persistent infection.",

To determine whether these target proteins are phosphorylated by Akt kinase after EV71 infection, we performed Western blot assays using antibodies against the phosphorylated forms of GSK3\u03b2, FKHR, caspase-9, and BAD. No apparent induction of caspase-9 or FKHR (Fig. 2A) or BAD (data not shown) phosphorylation was demonstrated as compared to the non-infected control cells. This negative result was interpreted by reference to a positive control such as 20% FBS-stimulated FKHR pathway (data not shown). Contrastingly, the phosphorylation of GSK-3 was induced approximately 3-fold by activated Akt at 0.5 h pi (Fig. 2B-C). Furthermore, GSK-3 phosphorylation was significantly inhibited by adding wortmannin to the cell culture, as shown in Lane 3 of Fig. 2B. This suggests that EV71 induces cell survival through the PI3K/Akt/GSK3 signaling pathway and that this action is independent of the Akt target proteins, FKHR caspase-9, and BAD.",

To examine this hypothesis in relation to EV71 infection, Vero cells were pre-incubated with or without 50 \u03bcM of PD98059 for 1 h followed by virus infection. The phosphorylation of GSK3\u03b2 was measured by immunoblot using anti-phospho GSK3\u03b2 antibodies. Treatment of cells with PD98059 resulted in considerable inhibition of EV71-induced GSK3\u03b2 phosphorylation (Lane 4 of Fig. 2). This indicated that GSK3 was not only activated by PI3K/Akt but was also regulated by the MAPK/ERK pathway after EV71 infection. Due to the profound inhibition of Akt produced by wortmannin, we could not test whether there was an accumulative effect from the addition of both inhibitors. Furthermore, since Akt protein was reported to be cleaved by caspases during apoptosis (Widmann et al., 1998, Rokudai et al., 2000), we next examined the integrity of total cellular Akt during EV71 infection via Western blot. There was no apparent reduction of the Akt protein levels up to 6 h post infection (data not shown).",

UV-inactivated enterovirus fails to express viral proteins due to the presence of thymidine dimers, which prevent the transcription of viral genes and render the virus incapable of replication. Interestingly, this does not interfere with the virus' capacity for receptor binding nor does it affect endocytosis into host cells (Beck et al., 1990). We hypothesized that the direct binding of the virus to host cells could trigger the survival pathway by phosphorylating Akt because the specific ligand\u2013receptor interactions could result in rapid and transient activation of ERK1/2, as described by Marshall (1995). We investigated the effect of inactive virus on the phosphorylation of Akt. The virus was UV-irradiated for 1 h and the remaining titer of the irradiated virus was completely abolished as determined by the plaque assay (data not shown). The co-culture of Vero cells and UV-irradiated EV71 leads to an early Akt phosphorylation event occurring apparently at 20 min pi (Fig. 4A and B). This phosphorylation peaked at 30 min pi, without significant loss of activity compared to the induction by an active virus. However, the sustained levels of Akt phosphorylation at 6 h pi, as displayed by the active virus, were completely ablated (Fig. 4C and D). This suggests that receptor interaction with EV71 is responsible for the early Akt activation, while viral protein production appears necessary for late-phase Akt activation following EV71 infection.",

For example, an interaction with Akt has been observed in a number of other viruses including human papillomavirus type 16 (Nair et al., 2003), Epstein\u2013Barr virus (Dawson et al., 2003), human cytomegalovirus (Johnson et al., 2001), and hepatitis B and C viruses (Lee et al., 2001, He et al., 2002). Such widespread involvement of these pathways suggests the presence of a global virus strategy to prevent host cell death. Furthermore, our results also confirm and expand aspects of previous reports that PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK are activated during the process of enterovirus infection (Luo et al., 2002, Huber et al., 1999, Opavsky et al., 2002). Moreover, the phosphorylation of Akt appears to be cell-type specific, in that Vero and MRC5 but not RD cells phosphorylate Akt (Fig. 1). This suggests that not all cell types are conducive to infection or it is possible that this pathway is not inducible in RD cells. Although Akt is not phosphorylated in RD cells, we observed phosphorylation of MAPK/ERK after EV71 infection in RD cells (data not shown). In the present study we have shown that EV71 subverts the cell survival signaling pathways which may enhance its own chance of survival.",

Generally, activation of the Akt pathway should activate a number of its downstream substrates. However, we found that P-Akt specifically phosphorylated only GSK-3\u03b2. There are many precedents of such events. Mizutani et al. (2004) have previously investigated the phosphorylation of downstream targets of Akt in SARS CoV-infected Vero E6 cells and reported that the level of phosphorylation of GSK-3\u03b2 was slightly increased, whereas phosphorylated BAD and FKHR were not detected. In cardiomyocytes, survival signals stimulated by insulin-like growth factor-I do not induce phosphorylation of BAD but suppress activation of caspase-3 (Wu et al., 2000).",

Toward the final stages of virus infection, persistent activation was observed only when the virus was not UV-inactivated. There are two mechanisms an UV-irradiated virus can employ to activate Akt and ERK. These pathways may be induced by direct virus\u2013receptor binding, such as that seen in the HIV activation of ERK (Popik et al., 1998), or by exposure to a viral protein, for example the hepatitis C virus core protein (Fukuda et al., 2001) and the HIV Tat protein (Rusnati et al., 2001). The very early activation peak observed immediately following EV71 infection strongly suggests that signaling is initiated directly by the virus binding to the host receptors. In support of this data, UV-inactivated EV71 only stimulates early-phase phosphorylation of Akt (Fig. 4). UV-irradiated, inactivated EV71 does indeed activate early but not late signaling (at 3 and 6 h pi, Fig. 4). Thus we show that UV-irradiated virus, incapable of replication, does not trigger late Akt activation. This finding suggests that the observed high level of late-phase activation is dependent on viral gene expression as has been observed previously in CVB3 infection (Luo et al., 2002, Carthy et al., 1998).",
