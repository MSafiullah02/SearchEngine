Qigong's body regulation is aimed at relaxation, so the movements are typically gentle and smooth. Regulation of breath involves changes in respiratory movement, rhythm, and pattern. Breath in Qigong needs to be slow, long, and deep. Sometimes changes in breath pattern are also required, such as abdominal breathing, and breathing with phonation, both of which are typical patterns of Qigong respiration. Abdominal breathing refers to a breathing pattern with obvious abdomen movement, and breathing with phonation is a combination of breath and the production of speech sounds. Regulation of mind includes focusing attention and visualization. Most operations of mind regulation are similar to meditation, therefore Qigong is also considered a meditative movement.8\n",

In the 1950s, experts and scholars reached a consensus and coined this methodology \"Qigong\", and the first Qigong institute was established in China in 1954.",

Dynamic Qigong refers to those techniques that primarily focus on body movements and involve more movements of the whole body or limbs. Tai-chi, Yi Jin Jing (Muscle Change Classic), Wu Qin Xi (Five-animal Exercise), Liu Zi Jue (Six-Healing Sounds), and Ba Duan Jin (The Eight Brocades) are examples of dynamic Qigong that have gained worldwide popularity. Contrastingly, passive Qigong techniques have almost no body movement, but require maintaining a certain posture and carrying out exercises mainly involving the breath and mind.",

Practitioners who have difficulty focusing their attention can concentrate on movements and actions in dynamic Qigong, which is an easier skill to master. Passive Qigong pays more attention to mind regulation. Attention training is an important and common technique of mind regulation that asks practitioners to focus attention on an object or on the present, which is similar to mindfulness meditation. According to theory of TCM, through extensive practice of focusing attention, practitioners can enter a state of tranquility. Passive Qigong has few requirements for physical strength, as it can be practiced in any posture without movement. In addition, for those with impaired body movement ability, passive Qigong is a better choice than dynamic Qigong. A study on mindfulness, conducted by Lacaille et al.,12 indicated that prolonged mindfulness practice was associated with an increase in mindful responding, which was in turn associated with increased positive affect and with less perceived stress and negative affect. Thus, those who engage in extensive practice of passive Qigong may be likely to experience better psychological outcomes.",

The \u201cevil\u201d refers to exogenous pathogens, which can be considered similar to the pathogen of infection. \u201cGood\u201d refers to the defensive function of the human body. When exogenous pathogens invade the human body, defensive Wei Qi fights against them. It can be considered that Wei Qi represents immune function from the perspective of modern medicine. The relationship between Wei Qi and exogenous pathogens determines whether the disease will develop and the prognosis of the disease. If Wei Qi is strong enough to defend against the exogenous pathogen, the disease would not occur, or would be easier to heal, and the prognosis would be good.",

Benson et al.13 observed physiological changes during meditation, and found that meditation can counteract stress response. Benson coined the physiological change elicited by meditation a \u201crelaxation response\u201d. As a meditative movement, Qigong has been studied as a tool for stress management. Ryu et al.14 observed changes in stress hormones during Qigong practice, and found that beta-endorphins increased in the middle of training while levels of adreno-cortico-tropic-hormone declined mid and post-practice suggesting decreased stress levels. It has been suggested that Qigong regulates emotion through enhancing nonreactivity to aversive thoughts and impulses by focusing attention, regulating the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis reactivity and the balance of the autonomic nervous system, and through changing the function of the brain, limbic system, and expression of genes linked to inflammatory responses and stress-related pathways.15 In a meta-analysis on treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with Qigong, Wu et al.16 reported that Qigong alleviated depression and anxiety among patients with COPD.
