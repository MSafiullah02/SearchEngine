Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was first recognized in late February 2003 in Hanoi, Vietnam [1]. Shortly thereafter, an outbreak of SARS occurred in Hong Kong, People's Republic of China, and 22% of the patients were health care workers (HCWs) in Hong Kong hospitals [2].

Within the first 2 weeks of this outbreak, which began on 10 March 2003, 69 HCWs were admitted for probable or suspected SARS [3]. Isolation wards for probable and suspected SARS cases were established, and infection-control measures involving droplet precautions was implemented [4].

In an infection-control program for the prevention of SARS, health care occupations associated with the highest risk for SARS must be emphasized-perhaps through educational activities or investigation of the procedures commonly performed by HCWs in such occupations-to modify practice such that the risk of exposure is minimized. In addition, guidelines and isolation precautions must be adopted and complied with [5] to control SARS.
