Threats of bioterrorism following September 11, 2001 and the deliberate dissemination of anthrax later that fall, the reemergence of novel or resurgent infectious diseases, (such as the West Nile Virus, SARS, influenza, avian flu) and rapid increases in diseases associated with sedentary lifestyles, poor diets, and smoking (e.g., heart disease, diabetes, cancer) have all raised the profile of public health. The U.S. government has responded with increased funding, reorganization, and new policies for the population's health, safety, and security. Politicians and the public more clearly understand the importance of law in improving the public's health. Recognizing that many public health laws have not been meaningfully reformed in decades, law-and policy-makers and public health practitioners have focused on the legal foundations for public health. Laws provide the mission, functions, and powers of public health agencies, set standards for their (and their partners') actions, and safeguard individual rights.",

The breadth and specificity of public health laws vary significantly across states given differences in political and legal environments. Yet when viewed collectively across the nation, state public health laws are often antiquated, fragmented, inconsistent, and incomplete. For most policy makers, the question is not whether to reform public health law, but how to do so. To address this inquiry, the Turning Point Public Health Statute Modernization National Collaborative, a partnership of public health practitioners and representatives from federal, tribal, state, and local agencies, and national public health organizations, developed model state public health legal provisions. The Collaborative's three-year effort culminated in the production of the Turning Point Model State Public Health Act (the \"Turning Point Act\"). 1 The Turning Point Act is the most comprehensive model public health law ever drafted in the United States. Its provisions include constitutionally and ethically sound bases for state and local public health agency infrastructure, power, practice, and safeguards. Rather than presenting strict mandates, the Act offers a menu of provisions for state and local officials to use voluntarily to assess their existing statutory and regulatory public health laws. In this article we explain how law (principally statutory law) can be a tool for improving public health infrastructure and outcomes, and demonstrate existing needs for public health reform. We then describe the provisions of the Turning Point Act, demonstrate why they are important, and Transforming Public Health Law: The Turning Point Model State Public Health Act",

            "text": "Legal interventions and structural supports are important tools for public health practitioners even when education, intervention, and popular opinion combine to effectively change or influence individual behaviors in ways that are conducive to the public's health. Law is a critical component to each of the three key elements of the national public health infrastructure: (1) health data and other factual information; (2) a competent workforce; and (3) systems and relationships. 2 Data about the health status of individuals, threats to communal health, and available resources are used to identify outbreaks, evaluate improvements or diminutions in health status, and assess the impact of program changes. Laws support and protect data acquisitions, uses, and disclosures, and authorize fact-based activities. 3 A competent workforce is also essential to accomplishing virtually any public health objective. Practitioners need the authority to gather, analyze, produce, disseminate, and act upon public health information. Legal competency is essential to establishing professional capacities and criteria for workforce competency. 4 Unlike the other two elements, application of law to systems and relationships seems fuzzy. The informal systems and relationships that develop within a public health agency and across communities are vague to practitioners who may be used to analyzing and applying statistical information. However, systems and relationships within public health infrastructures are amenable to legal analysis. Inter-agency and mutual aid agreements between state, local, and tribal governments form the framework supporting public health programs, and further allow communities to adequately respond to emergencies. 5 Laws underlie the organization of a public health agency (or a community public health system) and help identify key relationships, data flows, and performance expectations. 6 Though informally supplemented, formal relationships and structures (often set forth in law) may determine success or failure, especially in critical situations. 7 Viewing public health activities as if they were all part of a quest for universal acceptance of a set of behaviors that educated citizens will follow simply because they make sense seemingly diminishes the role of law. This narrow view, however, is misguided. Legal interventions are important even when education, intervention, and popular opinion combine to change or influence individual behaviors in ways that are conducive to the public's health. Non-legal approaches that devalue the role of laws in community policy decision-making are inherently limited, as seen nationally through recent experiences concerning tobacco control, vaccine promotion, and diet/exercise. In the first two cases, strong legal actions were necessary to achieve or at least move toward a preferred public health goal. In the latter, the obesity epidemic in the United States suggests that new solutions to change behaviors, products, and environments are needed, which in turn may require new laws.",

Unlike the federal government, states (as well as local and tribal governments) can widely legislate to protect the public's health through the exercise of their expansive police powers. 9 State public health laws can create a mission for public health authorities, assign their functions, and specify their execution. 10 Still, problems of obsolescence, inconsistency, and inadequacy may render older state laws ineffective or counterproductive. 11 The need for public health statutory reform was highlighted by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) in its 1988 report on the future of public health. 12 Finding that state public health laws are in many cases badly When viewed collectively across the nation, state public health laws are often antiquated, fragmented, inconsistent, and incomplete. For most policy makers, the question is not whether to reform public health law, but how to do so. outdated, the IOM recommended that states review and revise their public health statutes to (1) clearly delineate basic authority and responsibility of public health authorities, and (2) support modern disease control measures for contemporary health problems. In response, some states have updated and revised their public health laws. Texas, North Dakota, West Virginia, New Jersey, Michigan, and others have passed public health reorganization acts since 1990. 13 Washington used its general health reform law in 1993 to develop its Public Health Improvement Plan that set minimum performance standards. 14 Executive agencies in other states (such as Connecticut 15 and Illinois 16 ) also drafted comprehensive state public health plans. In 2003, however, the IOM continued to note that \"public health law at the federal, state and local levels is often outdated and internally inconsistent.\" 17 It recommended further action, including the development of the Turning Point Act, to stimulate state public health law reform.",

            "text": "Many public health laws pre-date modern developments in constitutional (e.g., equal protection and due process) and statutory (e.g., disability discrimination) laws. As drafted, these statutes may allow unfettered use of public health powers without due process protections, fail to respect individual freedoms, or prescribe unfair measures. In Montana, for instance, no due process procedures accompany a health officer's statutory power to \"isolate or quarantine persons who refuse examination or treatment\" for sexually transmitted diseases. Examinations can be made whenever the officer deems it \"advisable or desirable.\" 21 Vermont features even broader statutory authority: \"The com-missioner of health shall have the power to quarantine a person diagnosed or suspected of having a disease dangerous to the public health.\" 22 Laws like these are susceptible to constitutional or other legal challenges because they authorize intrusive actions under broad standards or without adequate protections. Even if unchallenged, these laws do not assimilate current public health practices, raising fundamental questions as to the legal authority to act. 23 Non-uniformity pervades state and territorial public health laws. Their independent evolution has lead to profound variations in structure, substance, and procedures for detecting, controlling, and preventing disease. Differing approaches can be appropriate for legal responses to public health dilemmas that are not prevalent in every (or even most) states. 24 However, variations can inhibit efficient responses in cases where coordinated, collaborative efforts are critical (e.g., multi-state public health emergencies). 25 Fragmentation in public health laws leads to other problems. Essential public health powers may be critically lacking for a given disease or condition. Such deficiencies surfaced in state responses to SARS. 26 For example, Alaska public health authorities and legislators were required to move quickly to add a new law to authorize reporting and quarantine for persons with SARS after legal advisors indicated that the State lacked legal authority to quarantine exposed persons. 27 Some state laws are so complicated, ambiguous, and inconsistent that they confuse health practitioners and their attorneys. 28 Though legal variation can be a strength, many existing public health laws need substantial reform. They fail to achieve fundamental aspects of public health preparedness: mission and functions of agencies, stable sources of funding, active surveillance and data evaluation, and adequate powers over persons and property. Public health statutes should: (1) provide adequate, modern powers to deal with the full range of health threats; (2) clarify standards and fair procedures concerning coercive and other public health powers; and (3) develop a stronger public health infrastructure. Act to serve as a tool for state and local governments to assess their existing public health laws and consider potential reforms. 29 The Turning Point Act is the most comprehensive model state public health law introduced in the United States (see Figure 1 , below, for a listing of its substantive articles and sections).",

What may be more important than comprehensive reform is the value of reviewing and analyzing state public health laws, of seeking to better understand respective roles and functions, of asking what improvements can be made, of pursuing those improvements in measured steps, and of building relationships among key players. Though its provisions and policy choices are not timeless, the Turning Point Act's potential to stimulate public health legal reform is.",

Even when state and local practitioners understand the importance of law to accomplish public health objectives, they often find that existing statutes are obsolete, inconsistent, and confusing. Layered over time, these laws accumulate to provide widely divergent and antiquated standards (both inter-and intra-state) for responding to a host of conditions, some of which share epidemiological traits.",

An increasing number of jurisdictions have chosen to review their laws and initiate changes consistent with the Act and their unique needs. This is the essence of state public health law reform in the twenty-first century: public health practitioners and partners making their own choices based on model provisions developed by and for public health practitioners.",
