This measles outbreak was the largest in California since measles was eliminated from the United States in 2000. The outbreak affected 12 California counties, with 88% of cases occurring in Southern California. Additionally, 16 cases in six other US states, 159 cases in a religious community in Qu\u00e9bec, Canada, and one case in Mexico were linked to the California cases. This outbreak, which included almost 30% of the 439 California cases since 2000, provides a unique window into the detailed dynamics of measles epidemiology and transmission in the post-elimination era, particularly outbreaks in large urban settings.",

Investigation is ongoing into whether transmission rates, i.e. the number of additional cases that result from a given case on average, are truly increasing and whether the risk of large outbreaks is growing. Ongoing estimation of transmission rates has implications for understanding the dynamics of measles in California and the United States (Gasta\u00f1aduy et al., 2018a). Previous work concluded that despite the exceptional size of the 2014\u20132015 outbreak, transmission rates have not necessarily increased (Blumberg et al., 2015).",

These efforts provided detailed information on the timing of cases and their contacts during this large outbreak, as well as information on the ages and measles immunization status of cases. A previous simulation study has argued that not all strategies to prevent the spread of measles during an outbreak are equally effective, due to the challenges inherent in identifying and locating contacts of cases, but that home quarantine for exposed susceptible people may be particularly effective (Liu et al., 2015). Changes in behavior due to news reports during this epidemic and depletion of susceptible people within a home or school may also have led to decreases in transmission over the course of this outbreak. With this analysis, we aim to determine whether there is evidence of a decline in transmission over the course of epidemic.",

Briefly, the outbreak began in December of 2015 with 42 cases who visited Disneyland theme parks during a 3-day period, and 3 additional cases whose rash onset dates were consistent with exposure during that 3-day period. The case or cases that transmitted to these 45 cases remains unknown. We explore the dynamics of subsequent known transmission, which likely is more typical of transmission in California (Blumberg et al., 2015). An additional 89 California cases were reported over the subsequent 3 months. The outbreak duration was 64 days, where duration of an outbreak is defined to be the amount of time between the rash onset of the first and last cases.",

The following age categories were used: Young Child (age 0\u20134 years), School-Age Child (5\u201318 years) and Adult (19+ years). Epidemiologists in California local health departments and at the California Department of Public Health determined epidemiologically linked cases using the reported contacts of cases. If an individual developed measles symptoms between 8 and 21 days following contact with an infectious case and had no other likely exposure source (within plus or minus 4 days of rash onset), these individuals were assumed to be epidemiologically linked. In one exceptional case, a link with a longer serial interval of 34 days was recorded, in which an immunocompromised individual was infected (Fig. 1). Vaccine status was based on immunization records, where available, and self-report when vaccine records were unavailable.",

The Wallinga-Teunis method of estimation of R requires an a priori estimate of the probability distribution of the serial interval from the onset of symptoms in a given case A to that of a case infected by A (Wallinga and Teunis, 2004; Cauchemez et al., 2006; Soetens et al., 2018; Kelly et al., 2018). Given the serial interval distribution, together with the onset time for each case of an outbreak, this method constructs an estimate of likelihood for all possible transmission links between cases. This can then be used to estimate the reproduction number for each case in the outbreak. Letting w(d) be the probability of an interval of d days, this estimation begins by defining a relative likelihood that any given case j is the source of infection of any case i, by normalizing the likelihoods for all possible sources to total one:\npij=w(ti\u2212tj)\u2211j\u2032w(ti\u2212tj\u2032)",

Can it be used to distinguish quenched transmission from a transmission process in which expected number of secondary cases is in fact constant, but actual number of secondary cases appears quenched? We note that R is always zero for the last case of an outbreak. Estimates of average R per day tend to generate a smooth curve of values from beginning to end of an outbreak, and while those curves can rise and fall or remain relatively constant for periods during the outbreak, they tend to begin at relatively high values, since early transmission is necessary to the existence of an outbreak, and take on low values at the very end, since the last case of an outbreak necessarily generates no secondary cases. For this reason, a disease process with a time-invariant expected R, observed in a series of discrete outbreaks, might yield declining estimates of R over time or over generations within each outbreak. Such estimates may decline from a relatively large number to smaller numbers later in the outbreak, perhaps simply as a consequence of the finite duration of each outbreak. Because of these questions, methods are needed to evaluate whether estimates of R that decrease with time within an outbreak are evidence of a quenched transmission process.",

Simulated outbreaks were conditioned on size of 131, the size of the Disney outbreak in California. 37 known trans-mission links, equal to the number reported for the Disney outbreak, were assigned at random. The methods developed above were then used to estimate R as a function of generation. Because of the above mentioned tail of improbably large generation numbers, generation length of the outbreak was estimated as 1/14 the number of days from first to last onset date, rounded down to the nearest integer, plus one, and only generations up to that length were estimated. This sequence of R values was fit to an exponentially decaying curve, R = Rie\u2212\u03c4m, for each generation m, by nonlinear least-squares fitting, using the nlmrt package in R.

These data provide an opportunity to describe transmission and quantify changes in transmission conditions during a large, predominantly urban out-break in the postelimination era. Second, we rejected the null hypothesis of no quenching during this outbreak using two different methods: showing that the observed quenching exceeded the expected measured quenching using Wallinga-Teunis estimation, and showing from simu-lation that the outbreak\u2019s duration was atypically short for an outbreak with no quenching.",

Our results suggest that such observed changes may in some cases be artifactual, since a finite sized outbreak will by definition have no transmission in the final generation and may proceed from high levels to lower levels of transmission in a roughly continuous fashion. That is, observed quenching conditioned on occurrence of a sizeable outbreak overestimates changes in transmission conditions over time.",

            "text": "Our study has several limitations. First, we observed a single, large outbreak that may not be typical of measles transmission in California, or the United States. These results should be validated against a more complete set of outbreaks. Second, while we found evidence for quenching, we cannot distinguish competing causes of changing transmissibility over time. For example, it is plausible that media attention and public health response played a large role in quenching during this outbreak, but during smaller outbreaks this quenching effect could be more minimal or non-existent. A study that determined how transmission over the course of an outbreak varied with outbreak size might help to falsify or fail to falsify specific explanations of quenching. For example, if quenching rates are no larger in outbreaks that received significant amounts of media attention, that would lend credibility to the hypothesis that saturation of local micronetworks plays a larger role in the quenching process than behavioral change due to information. Further research will have to examine possible sources of quenching. Third, the serial interval we used, while similar to previous interval distributions and based on empirical estimates, may not correspond precisely to the transmission conditions during this outbreak. Wallinga-Teunis estimation can be biased if the serial interval is estimated from a data set in which control measures were used, since intervals can be shorter before the start of control and longer after (Lipsitch and Bergstrom, 2004). We note that the observed serial intervals for the known epidemiologic linkages closely match the serial interval distribution we chose for the main analysis (Fig. 1). Since it is possible this is a biased set of epidemiologic linkages, we also performed a sensitivity analysis with a slightly larger serial interval (mean 14.5 days, s.d. 3.25 days) and found that our conclusions were unaltered. We tested secondly a smaller serial interval estimated from historical data (Klinkenberg and Nishiura, 2011) (mean 11.2 days, s.d. 2.62 days) and found that the outcomes were qualitatively the same, though p-values did not fall below the significance threshold in this case. We note that the latter serial interval distribution is shorter than seen in the 2014\u20132015 outbreak.",
