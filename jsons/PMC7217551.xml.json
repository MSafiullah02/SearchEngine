In reality, taking quick action before reaching the stationary state is necessary to control, e.g., the spread of a life-threatening virus or the word about marketed products. Despite such importance, theoretical understanding of the nonstationary state is far from complete. This is partly because of the time variation of relevant variables and having neither small nor large order parameters in the intermediate-time regime, defying analytic approaches based on approximations which are valid in the early- or late-time regime. Moreover, the speed of epidemic spreading shows a large statistical fluctuation, presumably due to the heterogeneity of the infection seed's degree and the stochasticity of infection trajectories [11,12]. As we will address here, the epidemic size at a given time suffers from such a large fluctuation that it is disqualified from being a reliable measure, particularly in the intermediate stage of spreading. Therefore, a new reliable measure and its theory are required to predict and control efficiently disease and information spreading in real-world complex systems.",

We study the simplest model, the susceptible-infected (SI) model, to investigate thoroughly the statistical fluctuations appearing in the temporal pattern of spreading and provide the theory for an alternative reliable measure. To quantify fluctuation, the distribution of the number of infected nodes I at a given time t is measured, which turns out to be so broad that the mean \u2329I\u232at loses its representativeness in the intermediate-time regime on heterogeneous networks. We show analytically that the asymptotic behavior of the distribution is derived from the dependence of the epidemic size I on the time when a hub, defined here as a node with a degree larger than 30% of the maximum degree, is first infected. In contrast, the distribution of the time t taken to infect a given number I of nodes is well concentrated at its mean. This suggests that the mean infection time \u2329t\u232aI can be a measure for the reliable description of the spreading phenomena. We construct a theory to evaluate the mean infection time, which leads us to discover, for strongly heterogeneous networks, the algebraic relation between \u2329t\u232aI and I in the intermediate stage contrasted with the well-known exponential spreading in the early stage. The origin of the algebraic-spreading phase is investigated, which helps us understand the temporal complexity derived from the structural heterogeneity in various complex systems.",

In simulations, we use the uncorrelated configuration model [17] to construct the SF networks, in which each node is assigned k link stubs with degree k selected as described below such that its distribution takes a prescribed power-law form, and then those stubs are randomly paired until no single or pair of stubs is left. Finally, an unpaired stub, multiple links, and self-loops are removed, the numbers of which are negligible in all the considered cases. For given N,L, and \u03b3, the degree ki of node i is given by the integer part of a real-valued random number r from a distribution p(r)=p1r\u2212\u03b3 for r0<r<N+1, with p1 being a normalization constant and r0 determined such that the resultant mean degree \u2329k\u232a=N\u22121\u2211iki is equal to 2L/N\n[18].

            "text": "Before addressing the theory for the mean infection time, let us consider why Pt(I) decays so slow in Eq. (1). Hubs are abundant in SF networks, and their infection should play a role in speeding up or slowing down spreading [11]. As seen in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b), the cluster of the first 80 infected nodes in the fastest spreading has many hub nodes infected very early, while that from the slowest spreading has only small-degree nodes infected early and hub nodes infected late. This suggests that whether and when hubs are infected determine the growth of the infected cluster. To check this, we measure the hub-infection time thub, the earliest time when any hub is infected. Using different criteria for hubs does not change the results qualitatively. When I is plotted as a function of t\u2212thub [Fig. 3(c)], its statistical fluctuation is significantly reduced in comparison to the large fluctuation for given t shown in Fig. 1. Moreover, I grows abruptly for 0\u2272t\u2212thub\u2272\u0394, with \u0394 being a constant. For example, \u0394\u22435000 for \u03b3=2.75 and N=106. This demonstrates that the global spreading can occur when hubs are infected. The number of infected nodes at time t satisfies the relation\n(2)\u2329lnI\u232a\u2243a0+a1(t\u2212thub)for 0\u2272t\u2212thub\u2272\u0394, with a0 and a1 being positive constants. Given the small fluctuation of lnI with respect to its mean in Eq. (2) for given t and thub and the observation that the probability distribution P(thub) is almost constant P0 for |thub\u2212t|\u2272\u0394 (see Appendix C), we obtain Pt(I) from Eq. (2) as\n(3)Pt(I)\u223cP0dthubdI\u223cP0/a1I,which agrees with Eq. (1). This finding provides a guideline for the epidemic-size distribution; Pt(I) different from Eq. (1) implies a relation other than Eq. (2). thub is expected to depend on the network characteristics of the initially infected node (seed) [11] and also on the specific realization of spreading in the early stage. We find both the degree of the seed and its shortest distance to a hub significantly correlated with thub (see Fig. 9 in Appendix C). In practically controlling the epidemic spreading, various factors can be influential, such as the k core [20], and should be considered when designing efficient intervention strategies [21] and identifying superspreaders and superblockers [22,23].\n",

In more complex spreading dynamics such as the susceptible-infected-susceptible and susceptible-infected-recovered models, the infected cluster may shrink in the bulk due to recovery as well as grow at the boundary, which could deepen our understanding of the spreading phenomena.
