In this study we assessed the death rate associated to COVID-19 in 24 Brazil and the United States of America (USA) to estimate the probability of Brazil 25 becoming the next pandemic epicenter. We equated data between Brazil and USA 26 obtained through the Worldometer website (www.worldometer.info). Epidemic curves 27 from Brazil and USA were associated and regression analysis was undertaken to predict 28 the Brazilian death rate regarding COVID-19 in June. In view of data from April 9 th 29 2020, death rates in Brazil follow a similar exponential increase to USA (r=0.999; 30 p<0.001), estimating 64,310 deaths by June 9 th 2020. In brief, our results demonstrated 31 that Brazil follows an analogous progression of COVID-19 deaths cases when compared 32 to USA, signifying that Brazil could be the next global epicenter of COVID-19.

The 41 transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), 42 initiating COVID-19, has led to this urgent pandemic status (Angelos et al, 2020) . 43 This disease initially appeared in Wuhan, China, which became the first epicenter 44 (Nature, 2020). Next, when the cases were partially controlled in China, Europe became 45 affected and was an added epicenter of COVID-19 (Nature, 2020). At present, the 46 United States of America (USA) is the current pandemic epicenter with in excess of 47 700,000 COVID-19 cases, consistent with the Worldometer website 48 (www.worldometer.info). 49 In this scenario, we understand that Brazil has the potential for a considerable 50 increase in deaths related to COVID-19 (www.worldometer.info). We comprehend that 51 Brazil has the likelihood to be the next pandemic epicenter of the disease. So, in this 52 report, we aim to evaluate deaths associated to COVID-19 in Brazil and USA, so as to 53 authenticate any likenesses between the countries. 54 55",
