Transmission of viral infections, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C are as low as one per two million blood products transfused [1]. However, other transfusion related complications persist, which can be life threatening. Transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI) is the most serious respiratory complication in transfusion medicine. Since 2003, it has been the leading cause of transfusion associated death in the USA. The Food and Drug Administration reports 43 % of transfusion related deaths due to TRALI from 2007 to 2011 [2, 3]. Due to the high morbidity and mortality, TRALI has moved to the forefront of transfusion medicine. As a consequence, a better understanding of the pathophysiology, risk factors, and mitigation strategies in TRALI prevention has developed.",

Anywhere from 65 to 90 % of reported cases are found to be immune-mediated TRALI, which occurs when leuko-agglutinating antibodies from the donor blood bind to conjugate recipient antigens [8]. By definition, evidence of antibodies from the blood donor are present; most commonly anti-HLA and anti-HNA antibodies, with anti-HNA3a associated with worse clinical outcomes [9, 10]. The second mechanism for development of TRALI is classified as non-antibody mediated TRALI and stems from an antibody independent mechanism. Approximately 15 % of TRALI falls into this category, in which no antibodies are found in the donor blood product. Silliman and colleagues have described the non-antibody mediated mechanism as a two-hit model. The first hit involves neutrophil priming and sequestration secondary to a preexisting condition in the recipient. In the second hit, biologic modifiers such as lipids in the blood product activate neutrophils and lead to capillary leak in the lung endothelium [11, 12] (see Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-41912-1_10).",

            "text": "Multiple recipient related risk factors are noted in the literature. Most of these studies are retrospective and small. However, it is evident from clinical data that the critically ill population is at the highest risk for the development of TRALI [13]. In one multicenter, prospective trial, history of liver transplant, chronic alcohol use, active tobacco use, shock, increased IL-8 levels in serum, increased peak airway pressures of >30 cm H2O on the ventilator, and an overall positive fluid balance were all significant risk factors for TRALI [14]. Multiple studies reveal sepsis and shock as major risk factors. Not only being critically ill, but also being on mechanical ventilation at the time of transfusion may increase risk independently. A prospective cohort study showed 33 % of patients on mechanical ventilation at the time of transfusion developed acute lung injury [15]. Multiple other studies have also shown recipient risk factors such as: major surgery within 72 h of blood transfusion, hematologic malignancy, higher APACHE II scores, and active liver disease [16]. The risk for development of TRALI also increases with the number of transfusions, as seen commonly in the trauma population where patients are receiving massive transfusions [13]. Not only critically ill patients, but cardiac and orthopedic surgery patients are also at higher risk for TRALI development [17]. The time on cardiac bypass appears to be correlated as well, with longer bypass times leading to higher risk of TRALI development [18]. Despite the multitude of recipient risk factors reported, most of which are seen in the critically ill population, TRALI is also reported in otherwise healthy individuals at the time of transfusion [19]. The development of TRALI in this healthy patient population supports the realization that the risk of TRALI is not dependent on the recipient alone.",

However, blood products with higher plasma volume are at the greatest risk, specifically fresh frozen plasma, apheresis platelets, and whole blood. In the FDA reported cases of death due to TRALI, fresh frozen plasma was the most implicated [7]. In one retrospective cohort study from 2007, fresh frozen plasma and platelet transfusions led to a higher incidence of TRALI versus red blood cell transfusion in the ICU population [20]. It remains unknown the exact amount of plasma which must be transfused in order for TRALI to develop. Reports of as little as 10\u201320 ml of plasma transfused before TRALI development are in the literature; however, plasma volumes greater than 50\u201360 ml are thought to be the threshold which puts patients at a higher risk [12].",

            "text": "Another important risk factor is the gender of the donor, and preventive strategies in the past 15 years have focused on gender related donor deferral\n. Female, multiparous donors have allo-immunization from pregnancy. Blood from this particular group of donors has a much higher risk of TRALI development in the recipient secondary to the anti-HLA and anti-HNA antibodies, which bind to recipient antigens and lead to immune-mediated TRALI. The prevalence of antibodies in this population increases with parity. A 26 % approximate frequency of anti-HLA antibodies exist if a female has had more than three pregnancies [21]. Another potential risk factor where studies have shown controversial data is blood product storage time. Experts in the field hypothesize that longer storage times of red blood cells may lead to a higher incidence of TRALI. Experimental models in preclinical trials show a positive correlation between longer blood storage times and TRALI; however, there remains no overt clinical evidence to support the finding [22]. Studies done in the preemie population showed no difference in the incidence of TRALI based on blood storage time. An ongoing study in the adult intensive care unit population is underway that hopefully will help to clarify the importance of blood storage time as a potential risk factor [23].",

By NHLBI and CCC definition 100 % of patients with TRALI have hypoxemic respiratory failure and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on chest X-ray. Clinically, the most common complaint of patients is dyspnea. However, a large number of patients are critically ill and on mechanical ventilation at the time of blood transfusions leading symptoms to be unhelpful. Despite patients being unable to report symptoms, clinical signs of respiratory distress and failure are present, typically within one to 2 h of a blood transfusion in the majority of patients. Predominately, patients are tachypneic, and in approximately one-third of patients, fever and/or hypotension may develop. Rarely patients may develop new onset hypertension. Most notably in the vital signs, SpO2 should be decreased compared to before the transfusion. Patients on mechanical ventilation may experience a change in pulmonary compliance with an increase in peak and plateau pressures. Pink, frothy secretions from the mouth or endotracheal tube occur in roughly half of patients who develop TRALI. Physical exam should help rule out other etiologies of respiratory distress and should be thorough including a complete lung, heart, and skin exam. Lung auscultation reveals bilateral crackles. Exam findings suggestive of cardiac failure should not be present, such as jugular venous distention and an S3 on cardiac auscultation. It is important to keep in mind that very mild cases of TRALI do exist, which may not fall into the NHLBI and CCC definitions. Mild cases may go unrecognized or present with a similar presentation to the underlying disease process, albeit in a less severe form.",

Since no gold standard diagnostic test exist for TRALI, and it occurs most commonly in the critically ill population with multiple other comorbidities, possible TRALI remains a very relevant diagnosis. If any of these other conditions exist or are suspected, a definitive diagnosis of TRALI cannot be made. Further diagnostic workup should be done in order to eliminate the additional etiologies. Fever can occur as part of TRALI; however, pneumonia, pancreatitis, and sepsis should be suspected as well as an etiology of the acute lung injury. CBC, blood cultures, and chest X-ray can all help to further delineate other disease states. Other conditions such as inhalation, drowning, cardiac bypass, drug overdose, and trauma may be more obvious from history alone.",

            "text": "Various other blood transfusion reactions exist, all of which can overlap with aspects of the clinical presentation of TRALI. Each blood transfusion reaction is managed differently, therefore it is vital to establish the correct diagnosis. The transfusion reaction that mimics TRALI the most is TACO (see Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-41912-1_12). TACO may coexist with TRALI and distinguishing between these two diagnoses may be difficult (Table 11.3). Both conditions present acutely during or after blood product transfusion. Also, both lead to acute respiratory distress and hypoxemia with bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray. While TRALI\u2019s clinical presentation stems from non-hydrostatic pulmonary edema with capillary leak, TACO is secondary to hydrostatic pulmonary edema. The two conditions are both transient but managed differently. Diuretics are the mainstay of treatment for TACO, but may be detrimental in the treatment of TRALI (see section \u201cMedications\u201d). A positive fluid balance is a risk factor for development of TRALI, and if the positive fluid balance is secondary to compromised cardiac function a higher awareness for TACO should exist. While no definitive test exists to distinguish between the two, diagnostic tools such as elevated jugular venous pressure, an S3 on cardiac auscultation, a transthoracic echo showing depressed cardiac function, and/or an elevated BNP may suggest TACO vs. TRALI. If the patient has a pulmonary artery catheter in place, an elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and/or central venous pressure also favors the diagnosis of TACO. As stated before, chest X-ray is unhelpful in distinguishing between the two diagnoses.\n",

Like TRALI, an anaphylactic reaction from a blood product transfusion may also lead to hypoxia and hypotension. Conversely, the clinical presentation of patients undergoing an anaphylactic reaction may demonstrate signs of airway compromise, such as stridor, bronchospasm, laryngeal edema, and/or wheezing, as well as an associated rash, urticaria, and/or diarrhea, all of which are not seen in TRALI alone. In septicemia from blood product transfusion, which can occur in the setting of contaminated blood products, microbiology is usually positive. Patients may also have a leukocytosis, which is very uncommon in TRALI. Platelets are most commonly associated with septicemia from a transfusion. Lastly, hemolytic transfusion reactions develop acutely with blood product transfusion, but hypoxia and acute respiratory distress are not the mainstay. Fever and hypotension occur in almost all patients with hemolytic reactions and less often in TRALI. Laboratory tests will also reveal a hemolytic pattern, such as a low haptoglobin, elevated unconjugated bilirubin and an elevated lactate dehydrogenase.",

Although mild cases are reported where little to no oxygen is necessary, almost all patients require some form of oxygen. Studies show up to 70\u201380 % of patients develop severe enough hypoxemia to require mechanical ventilation [28, 29]. There are no specific studies looking at mechanical ventilation strategies in TRALI specifically; however, it is reasonable to adopt the ventilation strategies from the ARDS Network trial [30]. The restrictive tidal volume approach with tidal volumes set at 6 ml/kg of predictive body weight vs. 12 ml/kg has been shown to improve mortality in ARDS, and therefore should be the mainstay ventilation approach in the TRALI patient population. Maintaining plateau pressures <30 cm H2O has also been shown to improve mortality and the incidence of barotrauma in the ARDS population [30]. In severe cases where mechanical ventilation fails to support the patient\u2019s physiologic demands, the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been described in case reports [31, 32]. However, no randomized control studies exist to support the use of ECMO for TRALI specifically.",

Only 1\u20132 % of anti-HLA and anti-HNA antibodies were present in the male, never-pregnant female, and prior blood product recipient populations compared to multiparous female donors with approximately 24 % of antibodies present [40]. Other studies report higher frequency of antibodies in the multiparous, female population as well, putting patients who receive blood products from this population at an increased risk for immune-mediated TRALI [10, 41]. In 2007 the AABB published the recommendation, \u201c\u2026blood collecting facilities should implement interventions to minimize the preparation of high plasma-volume components from donors known to be leukocyte-allo-immunized or who are at increased risk of leukocyte allo-immunization.\u201d Based on this recommendation, the deferral of multiparous, female donors from plasma donations was implicated. The policy to use solely male donors for plasma donation led to a two-thirds decreased incidence in TRALI [24]. Data also shows since the deferral of multiparous females from plasma donation, the reported cases of deaths to the FDA from plasma associated TRALI\ndecreased from 48 % before 2007 to 27 % from 2008 to 2011 [42].

Studies show that mortality rates from TRALI alone range from 5 to 10 %, with higher percentages quoted from the ICU population [24, 46]. Reports as high as 67 % mortality have been shown in TRALI patients who were critically ill at the time of TRALI diagnosis; however, the cohorts utilized in these studies included some \u201c possible TRALI\u201d cases as well [14, 16, 32].",

In ARDS, patients are known to have decreased exercise capacity and decreased lung function on pulmonary function tests for up to 5 years after initial pulmonary insult [47]. In patients who recover from TRALI there are no residual pulmonary complications. This population of patients returns back to baseline pulmonary function and does not have complications of pulmonary fibrosis. Permanent lung damage is rare [48, 49]. Based on limited evidence, it also appears patients who develop TRALI are not at increased risk for recurrent episodes of blood transfusion reactions from other donors. Caution should be taken with blood transfusions from previously implicated donors; however, overall patients should not be restricted from receiving blood products in the future [27, 50, 51].",
