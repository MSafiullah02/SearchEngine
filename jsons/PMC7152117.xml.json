Some cause distinct clinical syndromes that are readily diagnosed without laboratory testing (Table 1.6\n; see also Tables 1.1 and 1.4). In pharyngitis caused by parainfluenza and influenza viruses, rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the symptoms of coryza and cough often overshadow sore throat, which is generally mild. Influenza virus may cause high fever, cough, headache, malaise, myalgia, and cervical adenopathy in addition to pharyngitis. In young children, croup or bronchiolitis may develop. When influenza is suspected on clinical and epidemiologic grounds or confirmed by testing (polymerase chain reaction [PCR] is most accurate), specific antiviral therapy is available for treatment of patients and prophylaxis of family members. RSV is associated with bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and croup in young children. RSV infection in older children is usually indistinguishable from a simple upper respiratory tract infection. Pharyngitis is not a prominent finding of RSV infection in any age group. Parainfluenza viruses are associated with croup and bronchiolitis; minor sore throat and signs of pharyngitis are common at the outset but rapidly resolve. Infections caused by parainfluenza, influenza, and RSV are often seen in seasonal (winter) epidemics. Many agents can be identified using multiplex or targeted PCR testing, but there is rarely reason to test outpatients and infrequent benefit to testing inpatients except to confirm and treat influenza.\n",

Upper respiratory tract infection typically produces fever, erythema of the pharynx, and follicular hyperplasia of the tonsils, together with exudate. Enlargement of the cervical lymph nodes occurs frequently. When conjunctivitis occurs in association with adenoviral pharyngitis, the resulting syndrome is called pharyngoconjunctival fever. Pharyngitis may last as long as 7 days and does not respond to antibiotics. There are many adenovirus serotypes; adenovirus infections may therefore develop in children more than once. Laboratory studies may reveal a leukocytosis and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Adenovirus outbreaks have been associated with swimming pools and contamination in health care workers.",

Desquamation begins within a week of onset on the face and progresses downward, often resembling that seen after mild sunburn. On occasion, sheet-like desquamation occurs around the free margins of the fingernails; this is usually coarser than the desquamation seen with Kawasaki disease. The differential diagnosis of scarlet fever includes Kawasaki disease, measles, and staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome (Table 1.7\n).",

            "text": "Although signs and symptoms may strongly suggest acute streptococcal pharyngitis, laboratory diagnosis is strongly recommended, even for patients with scarlet fever (Fig. 1.3\n). Scoring systems for diagnosing acute GAS pharyngitis on clinical grounds have not proved very satisfactory. Using clinical criteria alone, physicians overestimate the likelihood that patients have streptococcal infection. The throat culture on blood agar plate has traditionally been used to diagnose streptococcal pharyngitis. Plating a swab of the posterior pharynx and tonsils on sheep blood agar, identifying \u03b2-hemolytic colonies, and testing them for the presence of sensitivity to a bacitracin-impregnated disk has long been the \u201cgold standard\u201d diagnostic test, but it takes 24-48 hours to obtain results. Rapid antigen detection tests (RADTs) that take less than 15 minutes can detect the presence of the cell wall group A carbohydrate antigen after acid extraction of organisms obtained by throat swab. RADTs are highly specific (generally >95%) when compared to throat culture. In comparison to hospital or reference laboratory throat culture results, the sensitivities of these tests are generally 75-85% and can be lower. The low sensitivity of these tests, coupled with their excellent specificity, has led to the recommendation that two throat swabs be obtained simultaneously from patients with suspected GAS pharyngitis. One swab is used for a rapid test. When the RADT result is positive, it is highly likely that the patient has GAS pharyngitis, and the extra swab can be discarded. When the RADT is negative, GAS may nonetheless be present; thus, the extra swab should be processed for culture. The sensitivity of rapid tests can be improved by restricting testing to patients most likely to have acute GAS pharyngitis and avoiding testing patients more likely to have viral pharyngitis. This takes advantage of the spectrum effect (or spectrum bias) associated with many clinical tests including RADTs and throat cultures; the pretest probability of having the disease affects test results. One of the best validated scoring systems for children was developed by McIsaac, et al. Patients with greater likelihood of GAS infection tend to have more McIsaac criteria (fever, cervical adenopathy, tonsillar exudates, no cough, 3-15 years old), but the positive predictive value of the highest McIsaac score is only about 60% (Table 1.8\n). In contrast, a score \u22642 is associated with a negative predictive value of about 80%. The presence of viral symptoms such as cough, rhinorrhea, conjunctivitis, laryngitis, stridor, croup, or diarrhea decreases the likelihood that the illness is due to GAS. Patients with a negative RADT result should not be treated before culture verification unless there is a particularly high suspicion of GAS infection (e.g., scarlet fever, peritonsillar abscess, or tonsillar exudates in addition to tender cervical adenopathy, palatal petechiae, fever, and recent exposure to a person with GAS pharyngitis).",

The convenience of once-daily dosing and palatability make amoxicillin an attractive approach despite its somewhat broader spectrum of antimicrobial activity. Penicillin can be given by mouth twice daily for 10 days or intramuscularly as a single injection of benzathine penicillin. Intramuscular benzathine penicillin alleviates concerns about patient compliance. A less painful parenteral alternative is benzathine penicillin in combination with procaine penicillin. Intramuscular procaine penicillin alone is not effective for prevention of ARF because adequate levels of penicillin are not present in blood and tissues for a sufficient time. Other \u03b2-lactams, including semisynthetic derivatives of penicillin and the cephalosporins, are at least as effective as penicillin for treating streptococcal pharyngitis.

In a U.S. study of students at a university health clinic, F. necrophorum was detected by PCR in 20.5% of patients with pharyngitis and 9.4% of an asymptomatic convenience sample; some had more than one bacterium detected by PCR of throat swabs. Many of the pharyngitis patients with F. necrophorum had signs and symptoms indistinguishable from patients with increased likelihood for GAS pharyngitis: About one-third had fever, one-third had tonsillar exudates, two-thirds had anterior cervical adenopathy, and most did not have cough. The symptomatic overlap of F. necrophorum and GAS and the presence of asymptomatic carriage could complicate the clinical assessment of sore throat in adolescents but F. necrophorum is difficult to culture from the throat and neither a rapid test nor PCR is available for use in clinical care.",

Approximately 80% of cases of Lemierre syndrome are due to this bacterium, but the proportion of patients infected or colonized with F. necrophorum who develop pharyngitis and Lemierre syndrome is unknown. Patients present initially with fever, sore throat, exudative pharyngitis, and/or peritonsillar abscess. The symptoms persist, severe neck pain and swelling develop, and the patient appears toxic. Septic shock may ensue along with metastatic complications, especially septic pulmonary emboli. Diagnosis is confirmed by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the neck and isolation of the organism on anaerobic blood culture. F. necrophorum is usually sensitive in vitro to penicillin, but some isolates produce \u03b2-lactamases, and treatment failure with penicillin has been reported. Many expert clinicians use metronidazole, clindamycin, a \u03b2-lactam in combination with a \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor (such as ampicillin-sulbactam), or a carbapenem. The septic thrombophlebitis of Lemierre syndrome can be polymicrobial; combination antibiotic therapy may be beneficial. Some patients require surgical debridement and/or incision and drainage. The case-fatality rate may be as high as 4-9%.",

This disease progresses rapidly to airway compromise. Patients are often drooling and leaning forward with the neck extended. Some patients may have stridor, but a muffled voice is more common. Management depends on establishing a secure airway by intubation and treating with antibiotics. When epiglottitis is suspected, the oropharynx should not be visualized or manipulated except in a controlled environment (intensive care unit or operating room) by someone with expertise in management of the airway who is prepared to immediately intubate the patient. Vaccination against H. influenzae type b has nearly eliminated this disease in childhood; however, epiglottitis caused by GAS, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphyloccocus aureus, and non-type b H. influenzae occurs occasionally.",
