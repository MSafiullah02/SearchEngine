This is particularly relevant for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission in Saudi Arabia (population 34 million), which experiences three types of population movements. First is the international and domestic movement of pilgrims in Saudi Arabia. On average each month about 1 million incoming pilgrims from 180 countries merge with about 1 million Saudi-national Sunni pilgrims (75% of the Saudi population) in Saudi Arabia's two holy sites and the nearest entry port of Jeddah.1 Second is the returning Shiite Saudi-national pilgrims (4\u00b79 million Shiite population in Saudi Arabia) who travel to Iran and Iraq for pilgrimage. Men and women older than 60 years are overrepresented among pilgrims. Third is routine travel to and from Saudi Arabia by Saudis, permanent residents, and non-pilgrim visitors for commerce and tourism, estimated to be about 3 million people each month.",

First, transmission related to international pilgrims in holy sites in Mecca and Medina region, largely among the non-Saudi population (49 [94%] of 52 cases). Second, transmission among returning Saudi Shiite pilgrims in the eastern province, affecting mostly Saudi citizens (45 [94%] of 48 cases). Third, general non-specific spread by routine international travel in the political and diplomatic hub of Riyadh province, mostly among the Saudi population (12 [67%] of 18 cases). The remaining provinces of Saudi Arabia did not have COVID-19 cases in the early phase. Of the three seeding patterns, by April 2, 2020, the second had the greatest affect on accelerating domestic transmission in Saudi Arabia, with highest acceleration of cases seen in the eastern region (99 cases per 100 000). Per 100 000 population, Mecca and Riyadh had 17 cases and eight cases, respectively, on April 2.",

The outbreak in the eastern region was reported on March 10 among four returning Saudi pilgrims. Saudi Arabia had not recognised the impact of Qom pilgrimage4 on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in eastern Saudi Arabia until then. The country's attempt to identify and quarantine returning Saudi pilgrims proved inefficient initially owing to non-direct routes of travel to Saudi Arabia through Gulf Cooperation Council countries. Saudi Arabia then encouraged returning citizens to voluntarily declare travel to Iran and repatriated stranded citizens using special flights.",
