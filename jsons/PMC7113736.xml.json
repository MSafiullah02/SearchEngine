            "text": "Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a widespread human pathogen that infects primarily epithelial tissues and causes severe diseases including mucocutaneous lesions in the oral mucosa (cold sores), encephalitis, meningitis, and blinding keratitis (Gopinath et al., 2012). After an initial infection, HSV-1 spreads to the nervous system and establishes latent infection of neurons in sensory ganglia of the host (Hill et al., 1996). Approximately 80% of the world populations are carriers of HSV-1 and about 40% suffer from recurrent infection (Gold and Corey, 1987, Palem et al., 2011). Current therapeutic drugs against HSV infection are nucleotides, nucleosides or pyrophosphate analogues, such as acyclovir, valacyclovir, penciclovir and famciclovir (Hsiang and Ho, 2008). After uptake by virus-infected cells, these drugs are activated by the viral thymidine kinase and inhibit the viral DNA polymerase. However, HSV infection remains a serious challenge because of the viral resistance and side effect (Crute et al., 2002, Field, 2001). Therefore, the development of new safe and effective anti-HSV molecules is urgently needed.",

            "text": "Many antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been shown to have inhibitory activities against HSV infection. According to the structure characteristics, these peptides are classified into five types: \u03b1-helix, \u03b2-sheet, cyclic \u03b2-sheet, \u03b2-turn and extended (Jenssen et al., 2006). Proposed anti-viral mechanism of \u03b1-helix mainly includes cellular target and viral inactivation, including Magainin, Cecropin, Mellitin, LL-37 and Brevinin-1(Aboudy et al., 1994, Albiol Matanic and Castilla, 2004, Yasin et al., 2000). Two kinds of \u03b2-sheet peptides, human and rabbit defensins, were shown to interact with HSV membrane/glycoprotein and cellular targets but not heparan sulfate (Sinha et al., 2003, Yasin et al., 2004). Another \u03b2-sheet peptide from frog, dermaseptin, was shown to have potent inhibitory effect when applied to the virus before or during virus adsorption to the target cells (Belaid et al., 2002). Two \u03b2-sheet peptides tachyplesin and protegrin were proved to have viral inactivating effect (Yasin et al., 2000). Cyclic \u03b2-sheet peptides such as \u03b8-defensin was shown to bound to gB protein and blocked HSV-1 attachment (Yasin et al., 2004). The \u03b2-turn peptides lactoferrin (LF) and lactoferricin (Lfcin) are antimicrobial peptides that were found to block HSV entry into Vero cells. LF had no effect against HSV after the virus had entered the cells, while Lfcin exerted anti-viral activity also after the initial binding of the virus to the host cells (Andersen et al., 2004, Jenssen et al., 2004). An extended peptide from bovine, indolicidin, showed a direct inactivation effect on cell-free HSV-1 virons by targeting viral membrane/glycoprotein (Albiol Matanic and Castilla, 2004).",

Some of them have been identified as anti-enveloped virus agents in our previous works. The peptide mucroporin-M1 was shown to be virucidal against the measles, SARS-CoV and influenza H5N1 viruses, and it inhibited HBV replication in vitro and in vivo (Li et al., 2011, Zhao et al., 2012). A natural a-helical peptide, Hp1090, was proven to have the property of killing HCV (Yan et al., 2011). Two histidine rich peptides were designed on the molecular template of a short virucidal peptide Ctry2459 and were confirmed to have enhanced bioavailability, which resulted in potent inhibitory effect on HCV proliferation (Hong et al., 2013). Another mutational peptide, Kn2-7, was also effective in inhibiting HIV-1 infection (Chen et al., 2012). These studies indicated that scorpion venom is a rich source of anti-viral peptides. In the present study, we screened and identified two peptides from the venom of scorpion Heterometrus petersii, which exhibited effective inhibitory effect on HSV-1 infection.",

As shown in Fig. 8\nA and C, FITC-labeled Hp1036 and Hp1239 peptides slightly entered the Vero cells and accumulated in granular structures in the cytoplasm after incubated for 1 h. However, they exhibited a higher amount of cellular uptake after incubated for 24 h, with a dispersed distribution in the cytoplasm. Moreover, when infected cells were incubated with Hp1036 and Hp1239 for 12 and 24 h, the infectivity of intracellular virus significantly decreased (Fig. 8B and D). These results suggest that Hp1036 and Hp1239 peptides enter the Vero cells and inactivated intracellular viral particles.",

Inhibition of cell-to-cell spread is important for topical microbicide development because a source of sexual acquisition also may be cell-associated virus (Sinha et al., 2003). The derived virucidal peptide, C5A, disturbs the integrity of the viral membrane and exhibits potent virucidal activities against HCV, HIV-1 and HSV-1. It is worth mentioning that C5A has a property of suppressing viral entry and established infection, which differs from common virucidal agents (Bobardt et al., 2008, Cheng et al., 2008, de Witte et al., 2011).",

Cells were precooled at 4 \u00b0C for 30 min and peptides were added together with virus for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C. At the indicated time the cells were rinsed and shifted to 37 \u00b0C for viral entry. (iv) Viral entry assay. Virus was attached to cells for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C and the cells were rinsed before peptides were added. The cultures were then shifted to 37 \u00b0C for viral entry. (v) Postentry assay. Cells were infected with virus for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C, at which time the virus was removed. The cells were rinsed and replenished with cover layer containing peptides throughout the experiment. (B, C) Antiviral activities of Hp1036 and Hp1239 peptides in time of addition assay. After 1 h postinfection, all cells were replenished with cover layer and cultured for 72 h, at which time, the inhibitory effects of peptides were determined by plaque reduction assay.",
