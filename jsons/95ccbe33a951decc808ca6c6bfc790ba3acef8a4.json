(2) To date, reducing transmission of the Covid-19 virus in order to both avoid death and mitigate demand on health care systems has been a singular aim of policy action. The spectre of overwhelmed tertiary health care (e.g. ventilator rationing) forecast by influential modeling institutes, has driven widespread and rapid application of rarely used policies to control contagion, including the deployment of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), including travel restrictions, bans on gathering, and communitywide lockdowns. (3) Risk models, public health experts and political leadership alike have given less attention to indirect health impacts likely to result from behavioral responses to Covid-19 and the application of NPIs, despite their being both predictable and severe. Such anticipated secondary effects include fear and anxiety, deferred or delayed health care, social isolation, business closures, unemployment, bankruptcies, foreclosures, and homelessness. (4) Available economic and risk assessment methods could help evaluate and quantify these secondary health impacts. Quantification of the indirect health impacts are also possible.(5) The needs of optimal policy making as well as pandemic response plans require including these indirect impacts on decision-making scales. Outcomes that might help balance our collective response to Covid-19 and might lead to policy countermeasures, such as income support.",

For example, school closure might disproportionately impact lower income families who have less access to other educational resources.
