The viral spike protein mediates SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells and harbors a S1/S2 cleavage site containing multiple arginine residues (multibasic) not found in closely related animal coronaviruses. However, the role of this multibasic cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 infection is unknown. Here, we report that the cellular protease furin cleaves the spike protein at the S1/S2 site and that cleavage is essential for S-protein-mediated cell-cell fusion and entry into human lung cells. Moreover, optimizing the S1/S2 site increased cell-cell, but not virus-cell, fusion, suggesting that the corresponding viral variants might exhibit increased cell-cell spread and potentially altered virulence. Our results suggest that acquisition of a S1/S2 multibasic cleavage site was essential for SARS-CoV-2 infection of humans and identify furin as a potential target for therapeutic intervention.",

However, it is conceivable that the activity of other cellular proteases is also necessary. Thus, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus spike protein (MERS-S) is activated by a two-step process: MERS-S is first cleaved by furin at the S1/S2 site in infected cells, which is required for subsequent TMPRSS2-mediated cleavage at the S2 0 site ( Figure 1A ) during viral entry into lung cells (Kleine-Weber et al., 2018; Park et al., 2016; Millet and Whittaker, 2014) . A cathepsin B/L-dependent auxiliary activation pathway is operative in many TMPRSS2 \u00c0 cell lines but seems not to be available in viral target cells in the lung because TMPRSS2dependent activation of the S protein is essential for robust MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV spread and pathogenesis in the infected host (Iwata-Yoshikawa et al., 2019; Simmons et al., 2005; Zhou et al., 2015) .",

In particular, we exchanged the multibasic cleavage site against its monobasic counterparts present in SARS-S or RaTG13-S (Figure 2A , RaTG13 is a bat coronavirus closely related to SARS-CoV-2 [Zhou et al., 2020b] ). This resulted in mutants SARS-2-S (SARS) and SARS-2-S (RaTG). Moreover, we either deleted all arginines in the S1/S2 site of SARS-2-S or inserted an additional arginine residue (jointly with an alanine to lysine exchange), giving rise to mutants SARS-2-S (delta) and SARS-2-S (opt), respectively. Finally, we introduced the S1/S2 sites of SARS-2-S and RaTG13-S into the background of SARS-S (Figure 2A ), which yielded the mutants SARS-S (SARS-2) and SARS-S (RaTG).",

SARS-2-S WT (wild type) was efficiently cleaved at the S1/S2 site ( Figure 2B ), in keeping with published data (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020) . Exchange of the S1/S2 site of SARS-2-S against those of SARS-S and RaTG13-S abrogated cleavage, and this effect was also seen when the multibasic motif was deleted ll Short Article ( Figure 2B ). Moreover, insertion of an additional arginine residue jointly with an alanine-to-lysine exchange at the S1/S2 site did not appreciably increase cleavability. Finally, insertion of the S1/S2 site of SARS-2-S into SARS-S increased S protein cleavability while insertion of the RaTG13 S1/S2 site did not (Figure 2B) .

The S1/S2 motif matches the minimal furin sequence RXXR and is closely related to the furin consensus sequence RX[K/R]R. Therefore, we analyzed whether decanoyl-RVKR-CMK, a furin inhibitor, blocks SARS-2-S pro-cessing at the S1/S2 site. Decanoyl-RVKR-CMK inhibited processing of MERS-S, which is known to depend on furin (Gierer et al., 2015; Millet and Whittaker, 2014) , in a concentrationdependent manner and had no effect on SARS-S expression ( Figure 2C ), as expected. Processing of SARS-2-S was also inhibited, indicating that furin cleaves SARS-2-S at the S1/S2 site. In order to determine whether cleavage at the S1/S2 site is required for SARS-2-S-driven cell-cell fusion, we studied S-protein-dependent formation of multinucleated giant cells (syncytia). No syncytia were observed in the absence of S protein expression while MERS-S WT expression resulted in syncytium formation, which was increased upon addition of trypsin or expression of TMPRSS2 ( Figure 2D ). Expression of SARS-S WT or SARS-S harboring the S1/S2 site of RaTG13-S did not induce syncytium formation in the absence of protease, but modest multikaryon formation was detected in the presence of trypsin or TMPRSS2. In contrast, SARS-S harboring the SARS-2-S S1/S2 site induced syncytia in the absence of Transduction efficiency is shown relative to that measured for particles not bearing a viral glycoprotein. Error bars indicate the standard error of the mean. Statistical significance was tested by one-way analysis of variance with Dunnett's post test (p > 0.05, ns; ***p % 0.001).",

SARS-2-S expression triggered syncytium formation that was strongly increased by trypsin and TMPRSS2. Syncytium formation was clearly less prominent and required the presence of trypsin or TMPRSS2 when the SARS-2-S S1/S2 site was replaced by that of SARS-S or RaTG13-S. Moreover, deletion of the multibasic motif resulted in a spike protein that was no longer able to induce syncytium formation even in the presence of trypsin or TMPRSS2. Finally, the addition of an arginine residue to the S1/S2 site of SARS-2-S jointly with alanine-to-lysine exchange strongly increased syncytium formation, indicating that viral variants with optimized S1/S2 sites might show augmented cell-cell spread and potentially altered pathogenicity. Thus, the S1/S2 site of SARS-2-S is required for cell-cell fusion, and this process can be augmented by adding basic residues to the S1/S2 site.",

In contrast, entry into TMPRSS2 \u00c0 Vero cells, which is known to be cathepsin B/L dependent, was not affected by these mutations (Figure 1E ), in keeping with results reported by Walls and colleagues (Walls et al., 2020) . Optimization of the S1/S2 site did not increase entry into the cell lines tested; it slightly decreased entry into both Vero and Calu-3 cells, for, at present, unclear reasons. Finally, alterations of the S1/S2 site of SARS-S did not augment entry efficiency.

Both viruses depend on furin-mediated pre-cleavage of their S proteins at the S1/S2 site for subsequent S protein activation by TMPRSS2 in lung cells, which fail to express robust levels of cathepsin L (Park et al., 2016) . Thus, inhibitors of furin and TMPRSS2 might be considered as a treatment option for COVID-19, and a TMPRSS2 inhibitor that blocks SARS-CoV-2 infection has recently been described (Hoffmann et al., 2020) . Regarding furin inhibition, it must be taken into account that furin, unlike TMPRSS2, is required for normal development (Roebroek et al., 1998) . Blockade of this enzyme for prolonged time periods might thus be associated with unwanted toxic effects. In contrast, a brief treatment might be well tolerated and still associated with a therapeutic benefit (Sarac et al., 2002 (Sarac et al., , 2004 .",

Thus, viruses with a monobasic cleavage site are activated by TMPRSS2 or related proteases with an expression profile confined to the aerodigestive tract. As a consequence, viral replication is limited to these organs and does not result in severe disease. In contrast, viruses with a multibasic cleavage site are activated by ubiquitously expressed proprotein convertases, including furin, and can thus spread systemically and cause massive disease. In the context of coronavirus infection, S protein cleavability has been identified as a determinant of zoonotic potential (Menachery et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2014) . The presence of a highly cleavable S1/S2 site in SARS-2-S may therefore not have been unexpected. However, it is noteworthy that all SARS-CoV-2-related coronaviruses of bats and pangolins identified today harbor a monobasic cleavage site (Lam et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) . It will thus be interesting to determine how the multibasic motif was acquired by SARS-CoV-2, and a recent study suggested that a recombination event might have been responsible Zhou et al., 2020a) .",
