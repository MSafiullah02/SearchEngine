When infection is spreading through a population, it is often more convenient to work with the effective reproduction number, R, which is defined as the actual average number of secondary cases per primary case. The value of R is typically smaller than the value of R0, and it reflects the impact of control measures and depletion of susceptible persons during the epidemic. If R exceeds 1, the number of cases will inevitably increase over time, and a large epidemic is possible. To stop an epidemic, R needs to be persistently reduced to a level below 1. Estimation of R is a simple affair if there is information about who infected whom. Then it is possible to construct an infection network (11), wherein cases are connected if one person infected the other. Estimation of R involves simply counting the number of secondary infections per case.",

Recent analyses of closely monitored epidemics have shown that it is possible to estimate the probability that one person has infected another if the spatial locations of the infected persons are available (11, 16). However, when only times of symptom onset are available, most investigators resort to approximating R by assuming an exponential increase in the number of cases over time (8, 17) or by fitting a specific model that summarizes assumptions about the epidemiology of the disease (7, 18, 19). Such assumptions can be avoided by using a likelihood-based estimation procedure that infers \u201cwho infected whom\u201d from the observed dates of symptom onset as provided by the epidemic curve. However, the computational burden of a straightforward numerical evaluation of the likelihood appears to be enormous, since it requires consideration of all possible infection networks, and even for a small outbreak of 50 cases there are almost 7 \u00d7 1082 possible infection networks (see Appendix 1).",

The model allows for a variable effective reproduction number Rt as a function of symptom onset data t, and the model parameters are estimated from observations on the SARS epidemic in Singapore (see Appendix 2). Applying the estimation procedure to simulated epidemic curves shows that most of the estimates are close to the actual reproduction numbers and that a few estimates based on small outbreak sizes are below the actual values that are used in the simulation model. On average, the estimates tend to be lower than the actual values but deviate less than 5 percent from the actual reproduction numbers. If we account for the effects of incomplete reporting and temporal change in generation interval, the estimates become only slightly less accurate, and on average they deviate less than 15 percent from the actual reproduction numbers (see Appendix 2).",

Around mid-March, control measures were implemented in all regions, and during this period the effective reproduction numbers decreased sharply. For some regions, the effective reproduction numbers continued to decrease at a slow pace, suggesting improvement of control measures while the epidemic was going on.

All observed sizes and durations of SARS epidemics are within this very wide range of possible outcomes resulting from chance alone. Additionally, we used computer simulations to explore the effect of the timing of implementation of control measures on the epidemic size and duration, in a setting that is typical for the SARS outbreaks. The simulation results show a high sensitivity to the timing of implementation of control. On average, a 1-week delay in implementation of control measures results in a 2.6-fold increase in mean epidemic size and a 4-week extension of the mean epidemic duration.",

The relation can be used to monitor the combined effects of transmission potential and control measures during an epidemic. We have shown that the epidemic curves for SARS in Hong Kong, Vietnam, Singapore, and Canada, though apparently different, are all consistent with a single time course of the effective reproduction numbers for SARS. This apparent difference in epidemic curves arises because chance effects, such as the occurrence of a rare \u201csuper-spread event,\u201d leave a lasting trace on the epidemic curve. In contrast, chance events manifest only as temporary increases in the reproduction number. Our analysis of the epidemic curves for SARS shows that one should be cautious in taking a smaller epidemic size and a shorter epidemic duration as proof of better infection control.",

We are certainly not the first researchers to do so: Infection networks have been used extensively in the area of sexually transmitted diseases (20), and an infection-network perspective was adopted to analyze a closely observed foot-and-mouth epidemic in Great Britain (11). Our contribution is the derivation of likelihood-based estimates of effective reproduction numbers, requiring only the observed time of symptom onset for the observed cases. The use of a likelihood framework provides a set of powerful tools for inference, uncertainty analysis, and model selection (20); the use of only time of symptom onset allows us to apply this method to routinely collected epidemic-curve data. However, estimation of effective reproduction numbers from epidemic curves has an intrinsic limitation that should be kept in mind: The effective reproduction number contains entangled information about the transmission potential (i.e., the basic reproduction number) and the effectiveness of control measures. These two components can be disentangled only when we obtain additional information\u2014for example, about the time of implementation of control measures. Moreover, individual contributions to the effective reproduction number are entangled if their date of symptom onset is smaller than the generation interval. This limitation can be overcome if more detailed information on who infected whom is available (see Appendix 1).",

This effectiveness suffices for eventually stopping infections in situations where each case causes up to 4.3 (1/(1 \u2013 0.77) \u2248 4.3) secondary infections.

Our analysis of the epidemic curves for SARS, as reported for Hong Kong, Vietnam, Singapore, and Canada, shows how crucial the rapid implementation of control measures has been in limiting the impact of the epidemics, both in terms of preventing more casualties and in terms of shortening the period during which stringent infection control measures were in place. A first lesson from the several SARS epidemics is that a timely alert against a new infectious disease is most essential. Our analysis suggests that the control measures implemented prevented approximately three quarters of all potential secondary infections; this may be insufficient to stop another new infectious disease. A second lesson, then, is that it is crucial to estimate the transmission potential of a new emerging disease as soon as possible and to establish whether additional, more stringent control measures are required.",

We use such simulated infection networks for testing the estimation procedure and for exploring the expected distribution of epidemic size and epidemic duration. The model allows for a variable effective reproduction number Rt as a function of symptom onset date t. In the simulations described here, we set the effective reproduction number to a value of Rt = 3 for cases with a symptom onset date before the issuance of the first global alert on March 12, 2003, and to a value of Rt = 0.7 for cases with a symptom onset date on or after March 12, 2003. The model draws for each case the number of secondary infections from a negative binomial distribution, which is determined by the mean R and the shape parameter kt = (Rt + Rt2)/\u03c3t2. The model uses values of kt = 0.18 for cases with a symptom onset date before March 12, 2003, and kt = 0.08 for cases with a symptom onset date on or after March 12, 2003; these values correspond to the distribution of the number of secondary infections per case as observed during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Singapore (4). The model draws for each new infection the generation interval from a Weibull distribution with a mean and standard deviation of 8.4 days and 3.8 days, respectively (8). Each simulation is started by one index case that produces at least 10 secondary cases, which corresponds to a SARS outbreak that is started by a so-called \u201csuper-spread event,\u201d to ensure that the epidemic takes off.",

To test for the impact of this temporal change in the duration of the generation interval, we modified the model by using two different Weibull distributions, one before March 12 and the other one on or after March 12, each parameterized according to the Singapore data. The estimates were, on average, slightly lower than they were with use of the same generation interval throughout the epidemic (the actual values of the reproduction numbers of the simulated epidemic curves were 3 and 0.7 for cases with symptom onset data before and after March 12, 2003, respectively; the average estimated values were 2.60 and 0.66 over 20 simulations).",
