The country went to lockdown after three weeks since the first case, when the total number of cases were over 880. Pakistan imposed a lockdown for more than a month which slowed the spread of COVID 19 effectively, however in late April relaxation in lockdown was allowed by the government in stages to lift the strain on the economy. In this study, the data has been analyzed from daily situation reports by the National Institute of Health Pakistan and the effects of initial strict lockdown and later smart lockdown have been studied. Our analysis showed a 13.14 Percentage increase in cases before lockdown which drops down to 6.55 percent during the lockdown. It proved the effectiveness of lockdown. However, the Percentage Increase in case grows up to 7.24 during a smart lockdown. If it continues to rise in this manner, Pakistan may need to enter again into a strict second lockdown.",

With no vaccine currently available, the only solution is to prevent and contain the disease by lockdown and social distancing. The countrywide lockdown was enforced on 24 March which continued for more than a month. A major cause of the initial spread of the virus in Pakistan is pilgrims returning from Iran at Taftan border. Over 7000 pilgrims returned from Iran out of which 1433 have been tested positive according to the situation report by NIH on 4 May [11] . Another cause of rapid spread is the religious mass gathering at Raiwind, Lahore in early March. About 80000 to 1250000 people participated out to which 3000 were foreigners from 40 different countries [12] . By 4 May, over 3033 cases had a history of attending this gathering.

It was fulfilling its purpose effectively towards the control of pandemic in the country but on the other hand it was causing difficulties for daily wagers, and small businesses. The complete strict lockdown continued for more than a month. It affected the country's economy as all industries and import exports were ceased. For a developing country like Pakistan, it was difficult to keep strict lockdown for a long time. Hence, the government announced a smart lockdown to be enforced in stages. It means to re-open low-risk industries like manufacturing businesses, construction, industries related to food and agriculture, and factories with daily wagers and labor. All businesses that were re-opened were directed to follow SOP regarding workplace cleanliness, use of hand sanitizers and masks, and maintaining social distance. After this relaxation in the lockdown, the number of new daily cases increased abruptly. An increase in free-roaming and unnecessary movement of people was also noticed which should be handled strictly by special forces in every district. If this situation is not controlled then in a very short time it could be unmanageable and our health facilities could not capacitate them. There may be a need for a second lockdown for that which could have even worse effects on the economy.",
