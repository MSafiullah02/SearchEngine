The development cycle of exponential technologies can be 'deceptive' during its initial periods of growth, and its fullest potential difficult to predict owing to unprecedented leaps in innovation. Exponential technologies are often 'disruptive' by virtue of their ability to outperform traditional solutions in effectiveness and cost, opening new market opportunities. Technologies are being 'demonetized', as software and hardware development becomes cheaper to manufacture, to the point of being free of cost. Finally, exponential technologies are 'dematerialized', with digitization of functionality removing the need for physical products; and they are increasingly being 'democratized', by way of becoming widely available to potential users. Examples of exponential technologies include: 3D printing, artificial intelligence (AI), industrial robots, robotics, digital medicine, drones, internet connectivity, genetic sequencing, cell phones, synthetic biology and nanotechnology.",

Generating data over expansive territories of land over time, RADARSAT-2's remote sensing produces a high-quality data product that has many applications in marine surveillance, disaster management and defense. RADARSAT-2 has strengthened capabilities for mapping, allowing for the creation of Digital Elevation Models (DEM)s, the detection and mapping of centimetre-scale movements at the Earth's surface (InSAR), and the extraction and identification of features to support environment management and security. The RADARSAT Constellation is CSA's latest evolution of the RADARSAT Program, and aims to ensure data continuity, improve operational use of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and improve system reliability. The three-satellite configuration is planned for launch in 2018, and will provide daily revisits of Canada's land and marine territory, as well as 90% of the world's surface. 20 Canada has used RADARSAT-2 technologies to monitor changes in vegetation, humidity in soil, crop productivity and disease transmission patterns. Currently, Canadian researchers are using RADARSAT to improve detection and prevention of urban health risks posed by high heat, air pollution and emergence of vector-borne diseases. 21 RADARSAT-2 images are used to characterize the pattern of urban landscapes to predict areas susceptible to higher heat and health-related risks. It is being 18 used to identify areas where air is stagnating, posing potentials risks for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, and to locate sites prone to mosquito breeding and transmission of vector-borne diseases. Satellite imagery has also proven useful for observing changes in ice cover and its impact on food security and health in the north, resulting from both transportation of supplies, drowning risk, and access to hunting grounds.",

CSA's RADARSAT-2 imagery has been used in Canada to effectively monitor vectors associated with West Nile Virus and Lyme disease, and other similar applications. 33 Beyond our borders, satellite imagery and tracking is providing insights into the seasonality of avian migration in relation to the spread of influenza and other pathogens including malaria and cholera. These processes have the potential to connect Canada to disease outbreaks in neighbouring countries via international flyways. 34 Partnerships between CSA, WHO, and the Public Health Agency of Canada are advancing applications of Earth observation for public health decision making and creating a basis for increased tele-epidemiology applications in global health, including for monitoring of public health emergencies under the IHR, such as Ebola and Zika.

In 2001, the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UN-COPUOS) established the Action Team 6 (AT6) as a mechanism for implementing recommendations of the third United Nations Space Conference UNISPACE III (1999). Co-chaired by Canada, an Action Team 6 Follow-Up Initiative (AT6FUI) was established with the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2007 to refine domestic and international priorities for public health applications of space technologies. In 2011, AT6FUI held a meeting on 'Space technology for Public Health Actions in the Context of Climate Adaptation\" together with UNOOSA and ESA, to foster knowledge exchange, partnerships and discussion around satellite technology applications to climate change and public health. 8 In 2015, The United Nations inaugurated an expert group on space and global health under the leadership of the Canadian government, the WHO and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). This initiative is part of a broader goal to apply space technology to socioeconomic development, articulated in the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space 2015 (UN-COPUOS) Thematic Priority #5: Strengthened space cooperation for global health. It outlines priority objectives around the use of space technologies and information systems to promote cooperation in emergencies, epidemics and natural disasters. 9,10 Most recently, in 2017, the CSA and National Research Council of Canada's Industrial Research Assistance Program (IRAP) co-hosted the Space, Health and Innovation conference which aimed to highlight latest research and 7 Lyons P and Hartani R.
