Inability or unwillingness to accept support was consistently reported across all case reports. There was a mixed picture of both active refusal and passive resistance in the asylum-seeking group and those not seeking asylum. Some of the case reports [3, 28, 32, 38, 42] described a variable pattern of refusal; ranging from active and angry refusal to passive resistance, thus, suggesting that refusal in PRS is a continuum. The most commonly reported feature in all cases was food refusal.",

The report of enmeshed parent\u2013child relationship should be addressed sensitively (Box 4). It appears to be over-emphasised in PRS case reports and it is difficult to conclude whether this is primary or secondary to the illness as it is not unusual for a parent to pander to the demands of a critically ill child.",

Van der Stege [29] administered lorazepam 2 mg/day with marginal improvement but the patient\u2019s mobility deteriorated when the dosage was increased to 4 mg/day. This had to be reduced to 2 mg/day and was used for several months but without discernible improvement. However, it is noteworthy that when catatonia was considered a provisional diagnosis, it did not appear to have received optimum treatment. Patients received an inadequate dosage of benzodiazepine [25, 28] and those who were treated with ECT [25, 30] received insufficient sessions necessary for effective treatment of catatonia. Authorities on the treatment of catatonia recommend incremental doses of lorazepam starting at 1\u20132 mg/day and gradually increasing up to (10\u201320 mg/day), and if there is no response, to administer between 10 and 20 sessions of bilateral ECT [9, 15]. Rasmussen et al. recommend using a smaller dose of lorazepam in young, elderly, or medically compromised patients [31]. In clinical practice, parenteral administration of lorazepam offers rapid response compared to oral administration [59]. The authors [24, 25, 28, 29] did not disclose the route of lorazepam administration in their reported cases.",

In addition to database searches, we increased our search yield by searching citation lists of the selected articles. This approach yielded the largest number of PRS cases to date which enabled a detailed review of clinical and demographic characteristics of samples of patients larger than would be feasible for comparable empirical studies. We rigorously assessed the methodological risk of bias using a validated assessment tool [20] and reported our findings using PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews [19], thus increasing the robustness of results.",
