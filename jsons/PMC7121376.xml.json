Conventional cloning techniques using plasmid DNA cloning vectors were not suitable to stably accommodate large coronaviral cDNAs. Moreover, in numerous cases, specific coronaviral cDNA sequences turned out to be resistant to cloning in conventional plasmid DNAs or were unstable upon propagation in prokaryotic hosts. Finally, however, several laboratories succeeded in establishing coronavirus reverse genetic systems based on full-length cDNA (1\u20133. Not surprisingly, those researchers had to solve the problem of \u201ccDNA instability\u201d and, accordingly, the solutions they provided are all based on nonconventional approaches.",

Preferably use restriction enzymes that produce nonpalindromic sticky ends with at least three nucleotide (nt) overhangs. Avoid the use of restriction enzymes that generate blunt ends, since ligation efficiencies of blunt end fragments are low. If there are no useful sites available at particular regions of the cDNA sequence, restriction sites may be generated that introduce silent nucleotide changes. Alternatively, introduce sites at the border of the coronavirus cDNA fragments for restriction enzymes that cleave outside of their recognition sequence and orientate the sites so that cleavage occurs in the coronavirus cDNA region (Fig.\n18.1\nA).\nGenerate a set of plasmid DNAs covering the entire coronavirus cDNA using standard plasmid DNA cloning techniques. cDNA insert fragments should have a size of approximately 5 kb. Make sure that the cDNA fragment borders are flanked by appropriate endonuclease restriction sites in order to release the cloned cDNA fragments by endonuclease digestion (see above). If particular plasmid clones appear unstable upon propagation in Escherichia coli, change the plasmid backbone, preferably to a low copy plasmid. If plasmid DNAs remain unstable upon propagation proceed with the cloning of the remaining part of the coronavirus cDNA and insert the respective unstable cDNA sequence on the vaccinia virus level by vaccinia virus-mediated recombination using RT-PCR cDNA fragments (see Section 3.2).The cDNA fragments corresponding to the 5'- and 3'-end of the genome should contain additional sequences as follows (Fig.\n18.2\n). To facilitate cloning into the vaccinia virus genome by in vitro ligation with NotI-cleaved vaccinia virus DNA (see Section 3.1.4) both end fragments should contain an EagI or Bsp120I site. (DNA cleaved with EagI or Bsp120I can be ligated with NotI cleaved DNA.) Furthermore, the 5'-end fragment should contain a promoter for the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase and one G nucleotide (if not yet present at the genomic 5'-end of the coronavirus genomic RNA) for the proper initiation of the in vitro transcription. The 3'-end fragment should encode a stretch of A nucleotides (approximately 20 nt) followed by a restriction site that is not present in the coronavirus cDNA sequence.\n\n",

Start with 50\u2013100 \u03bcg plasmid DNA. Isolate the cDNA fragments by gel purification using standard agarose gels. Avoid exposure of cDNA fragments to UV light during the isolation process (see\nNote 1). If palindromic sticky ends are present at the cDNA fragment termini, the number of possible ligation products can be reduced by dephosporylation of one ligation partner by alkaline phosphatase treatment (Fig.\n1\nB). Note that the ends of cDNA fragments corresponding to the 5'- and 3'-genomic end should be cleaved with EagI or Bsp120I and dephosphorylated by alkaline phosphatase treatment.Ligate cDNA fragments in analytical scale using high-concentrate T4 DNA ligase. Leave ligation reaction overnight at room temperature. Analyze ligation products on standard agarose gels. The samples should be heated to 65\u00b0C for 5 min before loading on the gel.If the ligation reaction worked efficiently in the analytical scale, use the same conditions for a preparative scale ligation. Analyze an aliquot of the reaction on a standard agarose gel. If inefficient ligation is encountered repeatedly, revise the assembly strategy by using alternative restriction sites.If the preparative ligation reaction was efficient, purify the desired ligation fragments by gel purification (avoid UV exposure; see\nNote 1) using the QiaexII gel elution procedure (Qiagen).Use the ligated and purified cDNA fragments from step 5 for further ligation reactions with further cDNA fragments until a full-length cDNA fragment has been obtained. Alternatively assemble fragments to obtain a set of not more than two or three cDNA fragments together encompassing the entire coronavirus cDNA sequence (see\nNote 2).\n",

            "text": "\nWe found that DNA that has been exposed to UV light is difficult and sometimes impossible to clone into vaccinia virus DNA. When purifying DNA fragments from agarose gels, cut small slices at the edges of the fragment band out of the gel and stain them with ethidium bromide. Use UV light to visualize the borders of the DNA band in the slices and mark the position. Insert the slices back into the gel and cut the piece of agarose between the two marked positions out of the gel. The DNA recovered from those agarose pieces have not been exposed to UV light and are easily clonable in vaccinia virus.It is possible to insert more than one DNA fragment into the vaccina virus genome by in vitro ligation (37). Up to three DNA fragments can be ligated prior to adding NotI-cleaved vaccinia virus DNA (see Section 3.1.4, step 1). However, we recommend this procedure only if the fragments can be efficiently ligated (a full-length cDNA fragment should be visible in agarose gels). Furthermore, the number of possible ligation products should be minimized using strategies illustrated in Fig.\n18.1.In order to prepare vaccinia virus, DNA the virus particles have to be liberated from cells and cell debris. This can be achieved by using a tight Dounce homogenisator or, as described here, by using the MagNA Lyser protocol. To establish appropriate conditions we recommend doing a pilot experiment in which several conditions are compared. After homogenization check for virus titers and decide for the most vigorous homogenization conditions that still leave the virus particles intact.This step results in DNase digestion of free DNA (mostly of cellular origin) and will leave the DNA in virus particles intact.Vaccinia virus genomic DNA has a size of approximately 200 kb. Standard pipette tips are usually too narrow and pipetting will result in shearing the DNA. To avoid this, cut the pipette tips to generate an opening of about 2\u20133 mm and avoid vigorous pipetting. Avoid drying the DNA. If the large vaccinia virus DNA is overdried it will no longer be possible to dissolve it in water.The ligation of insert DNA fragment(s) and the NotI-cleaved vaccinia virus arms is facilitated by adding NotI into the ligation reaction (11. Religated vaccinia virus arms are recleaved by the NotI enzyme allowing a new round of ligation. The 5'- and 3'-ends of the insert fragment are cleaved with EagI or Bsp120I and dephosphorylated. Therefore: (i) insert-insert ligation is not possible (owing to dephophorylated ends), and (ii) Eag or Bsp120I-NotI ligation products (i.e., insert-vector ligation) are not recleavable with NotI. As a result the ligation-restriction reaction will drive the overall reaction toward an accumulation of insert-vector ligation products.The ligation-restriction reaction may still contain a small proportion of unrecleaved vector-vector ligation products. These products may lead to functional vaccinia virus genomes without the insert cDNA fragment and may cause a high background in the rescue of recombinant vaccinia viruses (Section 3.1.5). We therefore recommend an additional NotI cleavage reaction after the ligation-restriction reaction.Since the vaccinia virus genomic DNA is not infectious, a helper virus has to be provided to rescue recombinant vaccinia viruses from DNA. We recommend fowlpox virus as a helper virus, since a fowlpox virus infection is abortive in mammalian cells, but can still serve to rescue vaccinia virus from DNA. Therefore, the recovered viruses will be vaccinia virus only (and no fowlpox virus).On days 2\u20134 p.i. the cells may look heavily infected, most likely owing to fowlpox virus infection. However, recombinant vaccinia virus cannot yet be expected in the cell culture. Just continue to cultivate the cells; most cell layers will recover. Usually, the first vaccinia virus-mediated CPE can be expected on day 5 p.i. and a peak is observed around day 7 p.i.. If cells get too confluent the medium can be changed.Freeze-thawing and sonication is needed to release and separate vaccinia virus particles from the cells and cell debris. For selection of pure recombinant vaccinia virus this procedure is critical.A ratio of 1:1000 of recombinant vaccinia viruses:parental vaccinia viruses can be expected. Thus, under selection pressure, single plaques should appear on CV-1 cell layers that have been infected with a 10\u20133 dilution of the transfection stock. At 2 h p.i., an overlay of 1% low-melting agarose in selection medium can be made. This is done to reduce the risk of contamination of recombinant plaques with parental virus. Because most vaccinia virus is contained within an infected cell within the time frame (2\u20133 days) of the selection, agarose overlays are usually not necessary.Six plaques is a reasonable number to pick. There is a limited risk of picking \u201cfalse\u201d plaques or plaques contaminated by parental virus that necessitates selection of a few plaques in parallel.D980R cells grow fast and vaccinia virus plaques are not as easily recognizable as on CV-1 cells. During the selection it is necessary to keep cells in good condition to facilitate the formation of easily detectable plaques. The risk of overgrowth can be reduced by seeding cells at a lower density, and cell death from starvation can be reduced by replacing the medium with fresh selection medium on day 2 p.i..It is possible, although not recommended by the manufacturer, to use the Promega RiboMax Kit to generate capped in vitro transcripts. One simply has to add a cap structure analog to the reaction. In the given in vitro transcription protocol the ratio of m7G(5')ppp(5')G cap analog to GTP is 2:1.The optimal conditions for the electoporation of long RNA molecules are dependent on the cells and the electroporation device. BHK-21 cells are known to be suitable for efficient RNA electroporation and should be the first choice. We recommend doing a pilot optimization to determine optimal conditions for RNA transfection. It is now well established that the coronavirus nucleocapsid (N) protein facilitates the rescue of recombinant coronaviruses in several systems (2,6,7. We recommend co-electroporating an mRNA encoding the coronavirus N protein (5\u201310 \u03bcg N mRNA produced by in vitro transcription). It is even more efficient to generate and use a BHK-21-derived cell line stably expressing the N protein (7.We observed replicon RNA replication in a wide variety of eukaryotic host cells. Although coronaviruses are usually species specific, coronavirus replicon RNAs are able to replicate in many cell lines once introduced into the host cell cytoplasm by transfection. Cell lines tested in our laboratory (using the HCoV-229E replicon) include cells of human (e.g., MRC-5, HeLa cells) and animal (e.g., BHK-21, 17clone1, L929 cells) origin.We recommend determining the lowest concentration of the selection drug where nontransfected cells die for the cell line of choice.Replicon cell lines based on commonly used cells such as baby hamster kidney (BHK) or Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are generally easy to culture. To increase the number of cells expressing a high level of replicon-derived transcripts it is important to split the lines often enough to maintain them constantly subconfluent. GFP is a convenient marker to determine the percentage of GFP-expressing cells by flow cytometry.Depending on the cell density and the stability of the compound it might be necessary to change the medium daily.GFP is a valuable reporter protein to determine the percentage of green fluorescent cells as a marker for the percentage of cells with actively replicating RNA or to determine the mean fluorescence as a value that indicates GFP expression levels. Some inhibitors may lead to a reduced overall number of green fluorescent cells, whereas some inhibitors may just reduce the mean fluorescence. To generate more quantitative data on the inhibitory effect of a compound and to gain some insight into the kinetics of inhibition, other reporter proteins, such as luciferase proteins or alkaline phosphatase, may be used.\n",
