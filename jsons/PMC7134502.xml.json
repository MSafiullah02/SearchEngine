In 2013, there were 33 active conflicts worldwide, with seven accounting for more than a thousand lives lost each in that year, and many more injured.1 Most of these occur in poorer regions of the world where there is little resilience in the basic healthcare infrastructure, and little or no availability of specialist healthcare to support the rehabilitation of injured personnel. Both governments and non-governmental organizations in developed countries have arranged at short notice the temporary transfer of civilian casualties with salvageable and recoverable injuries to specialist centres in their countries, offering services such as plastic and reconstructive surgery, treatment of burns, neurosurgery and orthopaedics. These patients may be infected or colonized with a variety of micro-organisms of infection control significance. Although some western countries have considerable recent experience of managing repatriated injured service personnel, the infection control risks presented by civilian casualties should not be considered to be comparable; the latter differ substantially in their pre-morbid levels of fitness and prior exposure to communicable diseases.",

The key is therefore to start planning as soon as it is announced that patients may be transferred.

Blood-borne virus infections may be endemic in the patient's homeland, or the patient could be incubating such an infection acquired during locally delivered healthcare. A wide range of infectious diseases, sometimes exotic, may be present in the country of origin as well as the more mundane ones that complicate surgical procedures all over the world.
