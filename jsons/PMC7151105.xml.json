            "text": "The novel coronavirus (COVID-19; previous official name issued by the World Health Organization is 2019-nCoV, its zoonotic origin is SARS-CoV-2, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) occurred in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and January 2020 [1]. This is seen as the third significant outbreak of a coronavirus, following China\u2019s SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that emerged in 2003 and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) originating in 2012 [1]. Public health outbreaks have deep uncertainty and do not adhere to specific boundaries, which makes risk communication more critical for developing effective public health preparedness strategies [2,3]. An effective risk communication, in general, means that all related risk messages can be presented and shared to participants in a risk communication process openly and timely, aiming to rectify the knowledge gap between the originators of information and those receiving the information, and adjust the public\u2019s behavior to cope with the risk proactively [4,5]. For instance, during the SARS outbreak in China, a perceived lack of information transparency in the initial phase wrecked the effectiveness of risk communication and broadened the impact scope [6]. Time is key to controlling outbreaks. Getting good information and acting on it rapidly can halt outbreaks before they need emergency measures. However, the early history of the COVID outbreak in Wuhan shows information disclosure and delayed decision making, which commonly illustrates an ineffective risk communication associated with COVID-19 [7]. With respect to risk communication for public health emergencies, we reviewed the dynamic process of risk communication of the outbreak management of COVID-19 and used a message-centered approach to identify weaknesses in the risk communication process. We further discuss principles for effective risk communication reflecting on Wuhan\u2019s case. Following these principles and Wuhan\u2019s practice, we will employ a simplified model to illustrate an effective network of risk communication. This study aims to point out an effective process of risk communication based on Wuhan\u2019s case, which can improve the understanding on the cause and impact of the risk and promotes protective behaviors among individuals, communities, and institutions [8].

As of January 2020, many patients have been found and identified as being infected by a novel coronavirus in Wuhan. Since 12 December 2019, when the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission reported 27 cases of viral pneumonia, including seven critically ill cases, the pneumonia outbreak has received considerable global attention. The COVID-19 cases have covered all provinces in China and have also been reported in other countries, severe areas including Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, and the US, and all of these cases were exported from Wuhan [16,17]. Chinese scientists have argued that the virus source comes from a seafood market in Wuhan, but a few infected people in Wuhan say they did not visit this seafood market. Pinpointing the actual source of the virus is a main task for current research\u2014different findings have been published [18,19]. An early epidemiological investigation revealed that bats may be the native host of COVID-19 [20]. The available investigations indicate that the virus has the characteristic of human-to-human transmission and is even infectious during incubation. These infections may either be asymptomatic or have symptoms that include fever, cough, and shortness of breath [21,22]. There is no consensus on its basic reproduction number (R0 or R-zero), although current scientific studies demonstrate that the range of R0 falls within 2.5\u20136.5 [15,23,24]. There is no complete knowledge on this virus, and epidemiological investigation in ongoing. ",

Internal communication refers to a situation where risk assessors and managers develop a common understanding of their tasks and responsibilities. It enables risk assessors and managers to appraise the potential impact and all possible outcomes based on the available information. Meanwhile, external communication enhances stakeholders\u2019 awareness of the negative impact of the risk and their recognition about their roles in risk governance and initiation of different behaviors [25,26]. Following this distinction and referring to China\u2019s regime, we define internal communication as the communicative process among governments and the academic community, because the majority of academic institutions are affiliated to the government or funded by officials. Furthermore, we posit that external communication is related to the information sharing between the government and the public. In accordance with the development of the COVID-19 outbreak, Table 2 illustrates the processes of internal and external communication with other events related to COVID-19 information.

A comment published by the New York Times speculates that the decision making was based on social stability [27]. Therefore, there was no adequate preparedness for outbreak management, including a timely warning to the public and active countermeasures for the risk. Organizational characteristics should be taken into consideration in the analysis of risk communication. Organizations often have a vested interest in a particular interpretation of risk [28,29]. The occurrence of the outbreak corresponded with China\u2019s political season, when officials gather for annual meetings of the People\u2019s Congresses\u2014the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)-run legislatures for discussing policies and praising government. Bad news is inappropriate at this time. As the governor of Hubei, Wang Xiaodong, pointed out, \u201cpolitical issues are at any time the most fundamental major issues\u201d [27]. At the same time, the harmonious and happy atmosphere brought about by the Chinese Lunar Year Festival in society foreboded the start of the most massive annual population migration, which is called the \u201cTide of Going Home\u201d. If the outbreak information were to spread, it would influence migration and intensify social fear. Based on balancing various considerations, the government\u2019s decision making had to depend upon maintaining political image and social stability, because the outbreak management might disturb the social order. In an interview, Zeng Guang, the chief scientist of epidemic of Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, indirectly admitted that the main problem came from the local government\u2019s decision making. Zeng said that the government is prone to balance many factors in decision making, such as politics, stability, and economy, and expert opinion is often partly considered by the government [15]. In addition, a prediction of the epidemics trend of COVID-19 in China conducted by Dr. Zhong Nanshan\u2019s group indicates if government control was applied five days earlier, the epidemic would have been effectively suppressed [30]. We can infer from this research that the government\u2019s reactive action should have been adopted earlier.",

Incipient risk external communication used a series of certain expressions, which conveyed the wrong perception of COVID-19 to the public. The actions of the authorities in attacking whistleblowers who privately delivered the clinical characteristics of the coronavirus on social media further enhanced people\u2019s risk perception about the outbreak. The public tended to believe that the disease had no characteristic of human-to-human transmission. As the epidemiological investigation went deeper, new conclusions made the authorities change their statement, using expressions such as \u201cno evidence shows the disease has the characteristic of human-to-human transmission\u201d. However, the public could not realize the characteristic of human-to-human transmission from such an expression, and thus had no perception for self-prevention. On 20 January, Dr. Zhong Nanshan confirmed the epidemiological characteristic of human-to-human transmission, which was a sudden turn in the content of risk communication. Therefore, the risk communication was not evidence-based but arbitrary, because it failed to conform to a dynamic process as the understanding of the risk evolved.",

The consequence was that lots of people queued up purchasing Shuanghuanglian at midnight. An expert clarified that this study is not a detailed research but only preliminary, and indicated that scientific expression should not be exaggerated [37].

Wuhan\u2019s case reflects the prerequisite of a message-centered approach, which means that the institution can be a barrier to information disclosure. The government\u2019s monopoly of information harms the public\u2019s right to know, and the fact that politics is the most important issue restricts the voice of the academic community. Reluctant information disclosure hampered the public\u2019s self-protection and exasperated negative impacts of the outbreak. As a consequence, the tardy strategy of lockdown broadened the outbreak scope subjectively due to people\u2019s migration. Meanwhile, in accordance with the characteristic of COVID-19, namely, that it can transmit in incubation, the public\u2019s ignorance of self-protection meant that the disease was able to infect others during gatherings and contact between people in an unperceivable way. Risk communication strategies require information sharing and establishing networks of working relationships among individuals, groups, and agencies.

The reality proves that \u201crumormongers\u201d are innocent and that the \u201crumor\u201d indeed functioned as an early warning. On 7 February, Dr. Li died from COVID-19, and his death unleashed an upsurge of emotion, with the public strongly criticizing the government\u2019s management of their response to the initial outbreak [39]. The shocking nature of risk can sometimes paralyze an organization, and even a holistic governance network. Therefore, inadequate preparedness, such as the shortage of goods, loose management in communities, and disordered collaboration amongst agencies, put the Wuhan and Hubei governments into a passive situation and undermined their institutional trust. As a result, the perception was that the organizations were immorally withholding risk information from the public.

Communicating uncertainty effectively requires assessing the different levels of perception among different audiences, and utilizing an evidence-based approach to convey uncertainty. As a tool for communication, the evidence-based approach has been used in quantifying and delivering uncertainty. In risk communication, particularly in public health, using equivocal expressions is most effective when they avoid overly certain predictions [8] (p. 23). However, equivocal expressions are subjective, because of the heterogeneity of different people\u2019s understandings. Thus, evidence-based communication aims to translate the verbal probability, such as \u201cpossible\u201d, \u201cprobably\u201d, and \u201cmaybe\u201d, into numerical probability, which can convey the degree of uncertainty in an unambiguous way [42].",

In addition, this communication results in a response from the receiver, which can then be evaluated against the desired response [44]. The public\u2019s feedback enables the government to adjust its emphasis of information delivery and provide information in relation to the public\u2019s own interests and values\u2014communication can be most effective when it reflects an understanding of what the public wants to know [43,45]. The existing literature indicates that a challenge identified in implementing openness in risk communication is that it is difficult to decide what to present and what not to present. For instance, complete transparency causes possibly unjustified fear among members of the public [46]. As we mentioned above, the initial intention behind the Wuhan government concealing information was based on the consideration of maintaining social stability. Therefore, transparent risk communication is just as necessary, but is simultaneously difficult to achieve in practice due to many complex decision situations. Information disclosure is a technical measure that needs to balance different factors such as public risk tolerance and possible subsequent outcomes. ",

Risk is related to professional knowledge and technology. The very essence of responsible and rational action is to make viable and morally justified decisions in the face of uncertainty based on a range of expert judgments and assessments. At the stage of risk assessment, the consensus of experts\u2019 judgments about the risk will ensure to assign an accurate probability for each possible consequence, to initiate each action, and to establish the rational decision as that which minimizes the negative outcomes and maximizes the expected benefits [34,47,48]. Governments ought to empower experts to work on comprehensive and detailed research on the uncertainty of a risk issue rather than restrict experts\u2019 voices out of other considerations, including politics or self-interest. The academic community should fully focus on the scientific analysis of the risk and sharing findings, data, and materials. In modern society, risk is an interdisciplinary issue. For public health risk, specialists in life and social sciences, biomedicine, and public health must seek better answers from multiple disciplines. Consensus on evidence-based analysis is the foundation of decision making. Uncertainty due to disagreement (experts, opinions, language) must be analyzed and disclosed, which aims to avoid misleading by ambiguous and diverse information [49].",

It represents external communication. A great challenge of risk communication is not only to convey knowledge, but also to find ways to convey comprehensive information that reflects uncertainty and empowers the public to make fact-based decisions about health [50]. The public always fails to understand the complex professional knowledge about the risk, so experts\u2019 responsibility is to translate the professional knowledge into simple and explicit content which can be easily understood. In Wuhan\u2019s case, a doctor named Zhang Wenhong said frankly, \u201cYou are unable to understand what I am saying definitely, because we read different books. You know every word in my sentence, but you do not know what I mean\u201d. Then, Dr. Zhang used quite straightforward language to explain how Shanghai is coping with the outbreak by integrating resources. His explanation received the public\u2019s praise and support [51]. The public need to express their appeals of uncovering uncertainty to experts when they encounter their unknown knowledge about the risk rather than seeking some unproven information or even rumors.

Different actors must fulfill their responsibility according to their roles and keep the communication network running. Accordingly, this model underscores the importance of partnerships in risk communication. Within the communication network, the government should and must play a leading role in communicating risk, and the proposed model offers a guideline to achieve this goal. Based on Wuhan\u2019s case, the government will continue to face challenges as uncertain and unexpected outcomes occur. Therefore, the government must collaborate with other actors to share information in a timely and effective manner, which enables every actor to adopt preparedness in advance for tackling any unexpected incident in the future.",

After the timeline of risk communication progress in Wuhan was given, we tried to illustrate the effective process and attention points of risk communication reflected from Wuhan\u2019s case. Following the message-centered approach, it was found that the Wuhan government did not infuse a scientific risk communication into policy decision, the local government stalled reporting and handled the information publicity in an ambiguous way which undermined public perception associated with COVID-19, and the authorities failed to treat it with the inherent uncertainty and different levels of risk perception of COVID-19, which worsened the circulation of rumors and led to public panic to some extent. The lessons from the outbreak management in Wuhan suggested that the accessibility and openness of information should be enhanced to form convergent points in the whole communication process, especially when dealing with uncertain issues, should keep the public regularly and timely informed, and should take care of the communication strategies dealing with uncertainties. Then, a simplified model of risk communication was employed to illustrate a collaborative network for effective risk communication. The government, experts, and the public should be involved in time, contributing diverse views and fulfilling respective responsibilities. In China\u2019s case, the government normally plays a leading role but sharing information in a timely and effective way needs to be solved in practice in the long run.",
