These mature signalling proteins are dually lipidated comprising a palmitate unit which is incorporated through an amide bond at N-terminal cysteine (N-palmitoylation) via the action of hedgehog acyltransferase (Hhat), a member of a membrane-bound O-acyltransferases (MBOAT) protein superfamily (Konitsiotis et al. 2015; Matevossian and Resh 2015), and a cholesterol moiety covalently attached to the C-terminal glycine via its 3\u03b2-hydroxyl group, Fig. 9.1c (Resh 2013, 2016). N- Palmitoylation is essential for signalling activity of Hh proteins during development while the cholesterol unit aids the signalling functions (Resh 2013, 2016). Aberrant Hh signalling pathways result in birth defects in humans including microencephaly, cyclopia, absent nose or cleft palate. The development of breast, prostate and lung cancer has also been associated with Hh signaling anomalies (Gupta et al. 2010).",

This post-translational lipid attachment plays a crucial role in regulating signalling during embryonic development and tissue homeostasis, Fig. 9.1d (Resh 2016; Nile and Hannoush 2016). It has been recently reported that Wnts palmitoylation is reversible; notum hydrolase, which participates in deacylation, affords an inactive form of Wnts with inhibited signalling ability (Resh 2016; Nile and Hannoush 2016; Zhang et al. 2015; Kakugawa et al. 2015). Targeting Wnt signalling pathways using synthetic modulators including small molecules and peptides is therefore a promising tool to inhibit Wnt-driven diseases such as cancer (Nile and Hannoush 2016; Anastas and Moon 2013).",

The sugar-rich domain can be further modified with the addition of various groups including other glycans, sialic acid and phosphoethanolamine moieties affording functionally diverse glycoforms of GPI anchors (Paulick and Bertozzi 2008; Ferguson et al. 2009). The lipid portion of the GPI moiety differs depending on the protein which it is attached to and the organism it originates from. The GPI anchor of human erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase for example, comprises three fatty acids in various states of saturation and lengths ranging from 16 to 22 carbons (Fig. 9.2) (Paulick and Bertozzi 2008; Ferguson et al. 2009; Deeg et al. 1992; Roberts et al. 1988b, a). The exact structure-activity relationship of GPI-anchored proteins is poorly understood due to the complex nature of the GPI anchor structure. GPI-anchored proteins are multifunctional; these proteins have been identified in receptors, hydrolytic enzymes, adhesion and regulatory molecules etc (Paulick and Bertozzi 2008; Ferguson et al. 2009).\n",

These structurally diverse cyclic peptides differ in the chain length and comprise 9-25 residues in the form of natural and non-natural amino acids including allo-threonine (allo-Thr), allo-isoleucine (allo-Ile), 3-hydroxyaspartic acid, Dab and homoserine (Hse). 4-Chlorothreonine is the amino acid responsible for the antifungal activity of syringomycin (Fig. 9.4) (Grgurina et al. 1994). The fatty acid moiety attached to the N-terminus of the peptide chain varies in length and composition and, similar to Bacillus-derived peptides, often features the \u03b2-hydroxyl unit. The lactone ring is generally formed between the carboxylic acid of the C-terminal amino acid and the hydroxyl group of either Ser, Thr or allo-Thr present within the peptide chain (Mnif and Ghribi 2015; Raaijmakers et al. 2006).\n",

Polymyxins are mixtures of structurally similar peptides. Members of the polymyxin B family mostly differ in the fatty acid component of the antibiotics.

Interestingly, it has been reported that the attachment of aliphatic chains of various length (C12-C16) can modulate antimicrobial and antifungal activity of otherwise inert short peptides (Makovitzki et al. 2006). Therefore, peptide lipidation can be used as an effective strategy to generate peptide drug leads with clinical potential.",

The palmitic acid moiety plays a crucial role in delaying liraglutide absorption and extending the half-life of the drug which has been estimated to be 13 hours after subcutaneous injection compared to approximately 2 minutes for the native GLP-1 (Rigato and Fadini 2014; Elbrond et al. 2002). In addition, renal clearance of the drug is reduced due to the shielding effect of the fatty acid moiety; liraglutide binds to plasma albumin via the fatty acid group preventing drug degradation by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) (Malm-Erjefalt et al. 2010; Watson et al. 2010). Lipidation of potent, but unstable GLP-1(7-37), much improved the pharmacokinetic profile of the peptide making it suitable for once-daily administration (Elbrond et al. 2002; Ryan and Hardy 2011).

Linear fatty acids ranging from C10 to C18 (1) incorporated into the liraglutide sequence using various linkers including \u03b1-, d-\u03b3-glutamic acid, 4-aminobutanoic acid (GABA), \u03b2-alanine and triethyleneglycol were evaluated (Fig. 9.8a) (Madsen et al. 2007). Interestingly, prolonged activity increased with the fatty acid chain length starting from 0.8 hours for C10, increasing to 5.1 h (C11), 7.6 (C12), 9 h (C14), 16 h (C16) and 21 h (C18); receptor potency was only affected when the acid chain length was longer than 16 carbons (Madsen et al. 2007). The study underlined the importance of the spacer between the active peptide and the fatty acid and revealed the complete loss of receptor potency when palmitic acid was directly bound to Lys-26 (Madsen et al. 2007). Liraglutide analogues containing \u03b1- or d-\u03b3-glutamic acid (2 and 3), GABA (4) or \u03b2-Ala (5), as linkers in place of the native \u03b3-Glu demonstrated similar activities and half-life values to those of liraglutide; unlike the triethylene glycol linker (6) which caused a 25-fold decrease in activity (Fig. 9.8b) (Knudsen et al. 2000; Madsen et al. 2007). Increasing the polarity of the fatty acid component by introducing one or more ether groups (7-9) or inserting hydroxyl group at the omega terminus (10) decreased the protraction of the analogues possibly due to reduced interactions with the fatty acid sites present on albumin, Fig. 9.8c (Madsen et al. 2007). Modification of the C16 palmitic acid in the liraglutide sequence with 2-hexyldecanoyl acid (11) which is equivalent to 16 carbon atoms led to slightly improved protraction (18 hours versus 16 h) and a significant decrease in potency of the analogue. Incorporation of more bulky phenyl- and cyclohexyl rings (12 and 13, respectively) in place of palmitate, or palmitate replacement with a pentylbenzenesulfonyl group (14) was not beneficial in regards to improved potency and half-life values compared to the original molecule (Fig. 9.8d) (Madsen et al. 2007).\n",

Extending the half-life of semaglutide to 165 hours was realised through systematic study of the fatty acid chain type and the spacer attached to liraglutide (Lau et al. 2015). The superior effect of a C18 octadecanedioic acid moiety attached to Lys-26 and a long spacer unit composed of \u03b3-Glu attached to two 8-amino-3,6-dioxaoctanoic acid moieties provided the optimal lead candidate (Fig. 9.9). Non-natural modification of Ala-8 with 2-aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) allowed for additional shielding of the molecule from degradative DPP-4 action (Lau et al. 2015).\n",

Oral administration of peptide-based therapeutics is therefore limited. Many strategies to enhance oral delivery of peptides have been described in the literature. Generally, they include attachment of permeation enhancers (such as glycosides, lipids and PEG) and/or targeting proteolytic enzyme inhibitors. Exploration of multifunctional polymers as a polymeric matrix to provide controlled drug release and drug encapsulation in polymeric nanoparticulate systems has also been reported. Using ligand-specific binding and uptake techniques which employ vitamin B12, biotin, folate, and lectins to name a few, as drug carriers was also demonstrated. A more detailed discussion on these topics is covered elsewhere (Park et al. 2011; Karsdal et al. 2011, 2015). A brief discussion of lipidation phenomena affecting oral bioavailability with selected examples of biologically active peptides is described herein.",

Promising reports on improved stability of mono- and di-palmitoylated insulin analogues in mucosal tissue homogenates compared to native insulin (Hashimoto et al. 1989; Hashizume et al. 1992) prompted further research into the effects of lipidation on the pharmacokinetic profile of insulin (Asada et al. 1994, 1995). The effect of acylation on the stability and absorption of insulin from the small and large intestines was examined using mono- and di-acylated bovine insulin analogues (Asada et al. 1994, 1995). Mono-acylated analogues were constructed via incorporation of caproic (C6), lauric (C12) and palmitic acid (C16) at the N\u03b1-amino group of Phe-1 of the insulin B chain; di-acylated analogues were prepared by modification of both the N\u03b1-amino group of Phe-1 and the N\u03b5-amino group of Lys-29 of insulin B chain, with two copies of C6, C12, or C16 fatty acids (Fig. 9.10a). Mono-acylated analogues were found to be more stable in small intestinal fluid at 37 \u00b0C (Asada et al. 1994) and increased absorption of caproic acid-modified analogues from the large intestine was observed compared to the native compound (Asada et al. 1995).\n",

            "text": "This \u2018lipid anchoring technique\u2019 allowing for subcellular drug delivery by drug conjugation to a lipid via a linker, was recently used to effectively inhibit the action of endosomal \u03b2-secretase (Rajendran et al. 2008a, b). \u03b2-Secretase inhibitors may be useful for the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease by blocking the enzyme involved in amyloid formation. The lipid-anchored inhibitors consist of three main parts which include the pharmacophore (\u2018message\u2019), the lipid anchor (\u2018address\u2019), and the linker which conjugates both parts together and allows for optimal flexibility of the pharmacophore within the lipid bilayer to bind with the target (Rajendran et al. 2012). Simons et al. (Rajendran et al. 2008a, b) showed that that conjugation of a sterol to the \u03b2-secretase inhibitor (Glu-Val-Asn-statine-Val-Ala-Glu-Phe) via a polyglycol linker resulted in greater efficacy; \u03b2-secretase cleavage of \u03b2-amyloid precursor protein (APP) was decreased resulting in reduced \u03b2-amyloid peptide formation (Fig. 9.11). Importantly, the cholesterol-enriched drug was readily internalized into endosomes and cholesterol-sphingolipid domains (rafts) within cellular membranes where \u03b2-secretase activity is observed (Rajendran et al. 2008a, b; Hicks et al. 2012; Cordy et al. 2006). Comparison of stearyl-, palmityl-, myristyl-, and oleyl-linked inhibitors revealed cholesterol- and palmitoyl-linked analogues to be superior in terms of raft partitioning ability (Rajendran et al. 2008a).\n",

            "text": "The lipidation site within the peptide chain is critical as it can determine the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of drug candidates by affecting the solubility and the self-aggregating potential of lipopeptides. Ward et al. (Ward et al. 2013) investigated lipidated glucagon-based peptides to identify acylated co-agonists for the glucagon and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptors (GCGR and GLP-1R, respectively). A number of palmitoylated and C-amidated glucagon analogues were prepared where Ser-2 was substituted with an Aib moiety to prevent enzymatic degradation by dipeptidyl peptidase-4. The N\u03b5-amino group of Lys-12 or an introduced lysine residue that was used to replace the mid-region moieties of glucagon, namely Tyr-10 or Tyr-13, Leu-14 or Ser-16, Arg-17 or Gln-20, was explored to attach a palmitic acid via a \u03b3Glu-\u03b3Glu dipeptide spacer (Ward et al. 2013). The solubility and aggregate-forming potential of glucagon analogues in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) was variable. Decreased solubility and increased aggregation was observed for the acylated analogue at position 14 which correlated with its reduced in vivo activity compared to the other analogues (Ward et al. 2013). Interestingly, the study also revealed an increased proportion of helical content for all C16 fatty acid-tagged analogues in addition to improved potency at glucagon and GLP-1 receptors for most of the palmitoylated analogues. This is the first indication of enhancing in vitro receptor potency through helix stabilization by lipidation (Ward et al. 2013). This finding further reinforced the importance of lipidation in the development of therapeutic peptides (Ward et al. 2013). It was observed that saturated fatty acids with longer chains (>C8) have greater conformation-stabilising potential compared with unsaturated or hydroxyl counterparts due to enhanced hydrophobic interactions with the peptide chains (Zhang and Bulaj 2012). Lipidation was also shown to be an effective tool to induce peptide oligomerization and self-assembly resulting in the formation of micelles, tubules, vesicles, mono- and bilayer structures that can be used in both the drug delivery and tissue engineering fields (Zhang and Bulaj 2012; Hutchinson et al. 2017; Hamley 2015).",

Better water solubility and similar or improved immunogenicity shown by Pam2Cys compared to Pam3Cys (Zaman and Toth 2013; Jackson et al. 2004), makes this motif an even more interesting synthetic target for incorporation into peptide-based vaccines. Structure-activity studies carried out for Pam2Cys demonstrated enhanced activity by the natural (R) configuration at the asymmetric glyceryl carbon, in comparison to the (S) isomer, namely S-[2(R),3-bis(palmitoyloxy)propyl]-l-cysteine [(R)-Pam2Cys], and S-[2(S),3-bis(palmitoyloxy)propyl]-l-cysteine [(S)-Pam2Cys], respectively (Moyle and Toth 2008; Zaman and Toth 2013; Wu et al. 2010; Takeuchi et al. 2000).

(Buskas et al. 2005). In this example, the resin-bound and side chain protected peptide T cell epitope derived from an outer-membrane protein of Neisseria meningitides (Wiertz et al. 1992) was first synthesized using Fmoc SPPS using the extremely acid sensitive 4-(4-hydroxymethyl-3-methoxyphenoxy)butyryl-p-methylbenzhydrylamine (HMPB-MBHA) resin affording H2N-Y(tBu)AFK(Boc)Y(tBu)AR(Pbf)H(Trt)AN(Trt)VGR(Pbf)N(Trt)AFE(OtBu)LFLG-resin (21) (Scheme 9.2). To minimize racemization at cysteine, Pam3Cys was introduced into the epitope sequence using the Fmoc-S-[2(R),3-bis(palmitoyloxy)propyl]-l-cysteine (Fmoc-(R)-Pam2Cys-OH) 22 under the activation of (benzotriazol-1-yloxy)tripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBOP), 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt), N,N-iisopropylethylamine (iPr2NEt) in a mixture of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and CH2Cl2. Subsequent acylation of the Fmoc-deprotected N\u03b1-amino group of Cys with palmitic acid and using PyBOP and HOBt, followed by resin cleavage [2% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in CH2Cl2] gave the side-chain protected Pam3Cys-tagged lipidated peptide 23. Finally, condensation of 23 with a spacer containing tumour-associated TN antigen 24 activated by DIC, 1-hydroxy-7-azabenzotriazole (HOAt) and iPr2NEt and ultimate side chain protecting group removal using 95% TFA gave the target vaccine construct 25 (Scheme 9.2) (Buskas et al. 2005)\n",

This approach takes advantage of the complementary modified Pam3CysSK4 motif with a bromo-handle and thiol-containing antigen that are subsequently linked together via a thioether bond. Key to this approach was the initial preparation of an active intermediate Pam3CysSK4-K(COCH2Br)-OH 36 that was accessed by microwave-enhanced (MW) Fmoc SPPS. Herein, a Wang-resin was initially preloaded with lysine orthogonally protected with Fmoc at N\u03b1 and with a 1-(4,4-dimethyl-2,6-dioxo-cyclohexylidene)-3-methyl-butyl (ivDde) at N\u03b5. Subsequent peptide chain elongation via the N\u03b1-amino group followed by lipidation using Pam3Cys-pentafluorophenyl (Pfp) ester [HOBt in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) for 45 min at 50 \u00b0C] afforded resin-bound and side-chain protected Pam3CysS(OtBu)[K(Boc)]4-K(ivDde). The ivDde protecting group was then removed using hydrazine, and the N\u03b5-amino group acylated with pentafluorophenyl bromoacetate. Subsequent TFA-mediated peptide cleavage gave Pam3CysSK4-K(COCH2Br)-OH 36. The key intermediate 36 was then converted into an active iodo-acetyl derivative using potassium iodide (KI) in urea/sodium acetate (NaOAc) mixture affording 37 (Scheme 9.5a). The iodo-acetyl moiety 37 was then ligated with several peptide epitopes that incorporated a thiol-terminated PEG spacer at their N-terminus. For example construct 38 was treated with 37 and trimethylamine (Et3N) in DMF at 40 \u00b0C affording construct 39 (Scheme 9.5b). The authors successfully applied this strategy for conjugation of a Pam3CysSK4 motif via a thioether linkage to B- and T-cell epitopes affording various self-adjuvanting vaccine constructs (Cai et al. 2013). The three-component construct 39 comprising P4 tetanus toxoid T cell epitope (Demotz et al. 1989; Monji and Pious 1997), linked via a PEG spacer with MUC1 glycopeptide comprising TN antigen, and a conjugated Pam3CysSK4\nvia a thioether linkage proved most efficacious (Cai et al. 2013).\n",

NCL conjugates two synthetic partners containing complementary reactive sites, namely an N-terminal cysteine and a C-terminal thioester moiety via a thiol-catalysed chemoselective reaction affording a thioester-linked product; subsequent S\u2192N transfer ensures the formation of a native peptide bond (Dawson et al. 1994). Brimble et al. (Harris et al. 2007) explored synthetic pathways to access Pam2Cys-linked thioester moiety that could be later incorporated into a long peptide via NCL. The initial effort to synthesise a more soluble derivative of Pam2Cys, namely Pam2CysSK4G thioester using tert-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) SPPS resulted in unexpected cleavage of the palmitoyl esters during the final hydrofluoric acid (HF)-mediated peptide removal from the resin (Zeng et al. 2011). Successful synthesis of Pam2CysSK4G thioester was however completed using an alternative Fmoc SPPS strategy employing a sulfonamide \u2018safety catch linker\u2019 (Backes and Ellman 1999; Ingenito et al. 1999) and Fmoc-S-[2(S),3-bis(palmitoyloxy)propyl]-l-cysteine (Fmoc-(S)-Pam2Cys-OH) (40) as the building block (Scheme 9.6) (Harris et al. 2007). Loading of 4-sulfamylbutyryl aminomethyl polystyrene resin with Fmoc-Gly-OH was initially performed [DIC, N-methylimidazole (N-Melm) in DMF/CH2Cl2 mixture] followed by standard Fmoc SPPS affording side chain protected peptidyl-resin 41. Subsequent coupling of lipidated building block 40 (Metzger et al. 1991; Hida et al. 1995) was effected (PyBOP/HOBt) and the Fmoc protecting group was exchanged to Boc (Boc2O in DMF/CH2Cl2 mixture) to provide 42. Resin-bound 42 was then activated with iodoacetonitrile in NMP, with subsequent cleavage from resin using benzyl thiol (BnSH). Finally side chain protecting groups removal using TFA afforded the desired Pam2CysSK4G thioester 43 (Harris et al. 2007).\n",

(Ingale et al. 2006) were the first to demonstrate a successful synthesis of a three-component glycolipidated peptide vaccine by sequential NCL of the suitably prepared ligation fragments; Fmoc SPPS was employed to synthesise the T-cell epitope C(Acm)YAFKYARHANVGRNAFELFLG-thioester (44), the tumour-associated glycopeptide fragment derived from MUC-1 CTSAPDT(GalNAc)RPAP (45), and the TLR2 ligand Pam3CysSK4G-thioester (46). Due to limited success when ligation of 44 with 45 was undertaken using standard NCL conditions (phosphate buffer containing 6 M guanidinium hydrochloride, thiophenol, 37 \u00b0C), new methodology involving incorporation of 44 with 45 into liposomes to aid solubility was used. A film of dodecylphosphocholine (DPC), thioester 44 and thiol 45 were hydrated via incubating in a phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) for 4 h at 37 \u00b0C in the presence of tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) to suppress disulphide bond formation. The mixture was then sonicated and the resulting peptide/lipid suspension formed uniform 1 \u03bcm vesicles. Sodium 2-mercaptoethane sulfonate (MESNA) was subsequently added and ligation completed after 2 h at 37 \u00b0C affording 47 in high 78% yield after reversed-phase high-performance column chromatography (RP HPLC) purification (Ingale et al. 2006). Ligation of Pam3CysSK4G-thioester 46 with thiol 48, accessed by removal of the acetamidomethyl (Acm) protecting group from 47 [Hg(OAc)2], using liposome-mediated NCL afforded a three-component vaccine construct 49 in 83% yield after purification by chromatography (Scheme 9.7). The scope of this technique was later demonstrated by the synthesis of other self-adjuvanting vaccine constructs that differ in the composition of the (glyco)peptide and lipid component; some of the constructs proved highly immunogenic when tested in mice models (Ingale et al. 2006; Ingale et al. 2007; Lakshminarayanan et al. 2012; Abdel-Aal et al. 2014; Ingale et al. 2009).\n",

Fmoc protecting group removal from the Fmoc-(S)-Pam2Cys-tagged vaccine construct (piperidine) could be then followed by N\u03b1-amino group palmitoylation using palmitic acid, HATU, HOAt and iPr2NEt in DMF. Finally, TFA treatment afforded fully synthetic vaccine construct 64 incorporating the Pam3Cys TLR2 ligand (Fig. 9.13). Biological evaluation demonstrated induction of potent humoral and cellular immune responses in transgenic mice (Thompson et al. 2015).\n",

            "text": "The need for large quantities of Fmoc-Pam2Cys building block required for SPPS conjugation poses a considerable obstacle due to the difficulty and cost involved in its synthesis. An alternative conjugation approach to incorporate the Pam2Cys moiety into a peptide could mitigate this conundrum. The copper(I)-catalysed Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of alkynes and azides to afford a 1,2,3-triazole conjugate (CuAAC \u2018click chemistry\u2019) offered promise for the conjugation of Pam2Cys with a peptide due to its tolerance of various functional groups and its complete regioselectivity to form 1,4-disubstituted products (Tornoe et al. 2002; Rostovtsev et al. 2002). The Brimble group therefore designed a Pam2Cys click building block containing an azide handle in place of the N\u03b1-amino group of the cysteine residue which could be then clicked to a peptide functionalized with a propargyl moiety (Yeung et al. 2012). However, initial attempts to directly introduce an azide onto a free N\u03b1-amino group of Pam2Cys using a diazotransfer reaction (Goddard-Borger and Stick 2007) proved unsuccessful, potentially due to obstruction of the reactive sites by the long palmitate groups (Yeung et al. 2012). A revised strategy was developed starting from an S-glyceryl cysteine intermediate 65 (Metzger et al. 1991; Pattabiraman et al. 2008) which was subjected to N\u03b1-amino group deprotection (piperidine in CH2Cl2) to reveal the amino group for the ensuing diazotranfer reaction using imidazole-1-sulfonylazide.HCl, K2CO3 and CuSO4\n.5H2O in MeOH (Goddard-Borger and Stick 2007) affording an azide-diol in 50% yield over 2 steps (Scheme 9.10a). Subsequent palmitoylation of the azide-diol [palmitic acid, DIC, and catalytic 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine (DMAP)] provided tBu-protected Pam2Cys azide 66 in 74% yield. Subsequent TFA treatment to remove the carboxyl protecting group gave the desired lipidated and azide-tagged \u2018click\u2019 ligation partner 67 in 84% yield (Yeung et al. 2012).\n",

Synthesis began by the N-terminal coupling of the Fmoc-(S)-Pam2Cys-OH building block 40 prepared from l-cysteine (Zeng et al. 2002; Metzger et al. 1991; Jones 1975; Hida et al. 1995), to the resin-bound C-terminal propargylated H2N-S(tBu)K(Boc)K(Boc)K(Boc)K(Boc)-Pra-resin peptide synthesized using standard Fmoc SPPS (Wright et al. 2013c). The peptide was lipidated using 40 and conditions adapted from Albericio et al. [benzotriazol-1-yloxytris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (BOP), 2,4,6-collidine, CH2Cl2/DCM (1:1)] (Han et al. 1996). Subsequent Fmoc-deprotection, followed by TFA-mediated resin cleavage and RP HPLC purification afforded the desired construct 82. Acylation of the N\u03b1-amino group of cysteine to give 83 was performed using a mixture of acetic anhydride and iPr2NEt in DMF, prior to peptide cleavage and purification (Wright et al. 2013c). A truncated fragment of ppUL83 protein, namely NLVPMVATV, derived from the cytomegalovirus (CMV) known to stimulate CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells (Kopycinski et al. 2010) was chosen as a model epitope for the \u2018click\u2019 reaction. Synthesis of two NLVPMVATV analogues incorporating an azide handle at either the N- or C-terminus was also required. For the preparation of an azide-tagged antigen at the N-terminal site of the peptide 84, Fmoc SPPS was employed starting from 4-(hydroxymethyl)phenoxypropanoic acid (HMPP) resin and coupling of 2-azidoacetic acid to the N-terminal Asn at the last step of the SPPS. Subsequent acid-mediated peptide cleavage from the resin followed by RP HPLC purification afforded the desired \u2018click\u2019 partner 84 (Scheme 9.13b).\n",

The Brimble group have recently applied for the first time, a single step \u2018 thiol-ene\u2019 coupling to synthesise monoacyl lipopeptides that showed self-adjuvanting antigenic activity with potency comparable to that of the synthetically challenging Pam3Cys moiety (Wright et al. 2013a, b; Brimble et al. 2014). We envisaged lipid attachment via the \u2018post-translational\u2019 route where the desired peptide constructs incorporating a cysteine at the N-terminus are first synthesized followed by S-lipidation with inexpensive and commercially available vinyl palmitate using the \u2018 thiol-ene\u2019 reaction. The viability of the transformation was first tested by preparation of the S-palmitoylated, N\u03b1-Fmoc protected cysteine, starting from commercially available Fmoc-Cys(Trt)-OH which thiol protecting group was removed (TFA) affording Fmoc-Cys-OH (90). This was followed by hydrothiolation of vinyl palmitate 91 using UV light at 365 nm and 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone (DMPA) as photoinitiator in CH2Cl2 for 60 min. The S-palmitoylated, N\u03b1-Fmoc protected cysteine 92 was obtained in satisfactory yield (44%) (Scheme 9.14a) (Wright et al. 2013a, b). Subsequent direct lipidation of short, unprotected peptides CysSK4 and N\u03b1-acetylated CysSK4 using 91, DMPA and photoinitiation (365 nm), was examined. The study revealed the need for extraneous thiols to obviate problems of vinyl palmitate telomerization and mixed disulphide formation. The choice of solvent also proved critical for a successful reaction. The optimized \u2018 thiol-ene\u2019 conditions (DMPA, DTT as thiol additive, NMP, h\u03bd 365 nm) were then used to directly lipidate N\u03b1-acetylated CysSK4\n93 using vinyl palmitate (91) with high conversion (>90%) to the S-palmitoylated peptide 94 (Scheme 9.14b).\n",

Therefore, the coupling of S-palmitoylated, N\u03b1\u2013protected building blocks, 92 or 99 to a model peptide sequence was evaluated (Kopycinski et al. 2010). The Met residue of NLVPMVATV was substituted with Cys(tBu) to demonstrate applicability of the \u2018 thiol-ene\u2019 reaction conditions to a suitably protected cysteine thiol. The resin-bound and side-chain protected peptide H2N-S(tBu)K(Boc)K(Boc)K(Boc)K(Boc)-N(Trt)LVPC(tBu)VAT(tBu)V-resin (100) was prepared using Fmoc SPPS at room temperature with HATU/iPr2NEt and piperidine as coupling and Fmoc deprotection reagents and acylation with the lipidated building blocks, 92 or 99 was undertaken using racemization-suppressing conditions (PyBOP, 2,4,6-collidine, room temperature) (Zhang et al. 2012; Carpino et al. 1994; Carpino and El-Faham 1994). In the case of N\u03b1-Fmoc-protected 92, the Fmoc protecting group was removed after coupling and subsequently exchanged for an acetyl group before TFA-mediated peptide cleavage was performed affording 101 (Scheme 9.15c). This allowed for a direct comparison of RP HPLC profiles to assess the degree of racemization. The RP HPLC chromatogram investigation of crude 101, obtained by using either 92 or 99 building block revealed that 1:1 ratio of epimers was formed when acetamide protecting group was used for lipidated cysteine incorporation. No detectable epimerization was however observed when N\u03b1-Fmoc-protected 92 was used for lipid incorporation. The type of N\u03b1-protecting group clearly influenced the degree of racemization during the study indicating the preferred choice of Fmoc-protected building block 92 for Fmoc SPPS-mediated peptide lipidation.",

Subsequent photoinitiated lipidation at 365 nm of 102 using vinyl palmitate 91 (7 equiv) and previously reported conditions [DMPA (0.5 equiv), DTT (3 equiv) in NMP for 60 min] afforded S-palmitoylated peptide 101 albeit in variable yields (Scheme 9.16a) (Wright et al. 2013a; Wright et al. 2013b). A careful examination of LC-MS profiles of the \u2018 thiol-ene\u2019 reaction leading to desired conjugate 101 identified formation of unwanted by-products such as DTT-adducts and bis-palmitoylated peptide 104. The competitive formation of 104 by-product was found to increase with increasing levels of vinyl palmitate in the reaction mixture. Substitution of DTT with the more bulky mercaptan tert-butyl thiol (tBuSH) proved superior in suppressing an unwanted addition of the thiol scavenger to the carbon-centered radical 103. Formation of undesired bis-palmitoylated adduct 104 was also diminished by including an organosilane-based coreductant (iPr3SiH) that facilitated hydrogen transfer to the radical intermediate 103. Furthermore, decreasing the pH of reaction mixture with TFA led to a cleaner reaction profile, presumably a result of protonation of electron-rich amine residues. Moreover, a large excess of vinyl palmitate (91), tert-butyl mercaptan and iPr3SiH were also needed to maximise conversion of 102 to the desired 101. Although a large excess of vinyl palmitate was used in the optimized, photoinitiated (h\u03bd 365 nm) conditions [91 (70 equiv), DMPA (0.5 equiv), tBuSH (80 equiv), iPr3SiH (80 equiv), TFA (5% v/v) in NMP for 30 min], a now quantitative conversion of peptide 102 to the S-monopalmitoylated construct 101 (95%, based on the corresponding peak integration on the RP HPLC profile) was observed with negligible levels of bis-adduct 104 formed (Scheme 9.16b).\n",
