The virus was used to infect DBT cells in the wells of 96\u2010well tissue culture plates at a concentration of 0.1\u20130.01 plaque\u2010forming units (PFU) per well. At 24 h after infection, the culture supernatant in wells in which a single and distinct plaque was observed was transferred to na\u00efve DBT cell culture medium in 24\u2010well plates. After three passages to obtain an adequate amount of the cloned viral stock for further experiments, the S protein\u2010coding region of each clone was sequenced after amplification of the S gene employing a reverse transcription polymerase\u2010chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR), as described previously.\n24\n A clone, designated as srr7 (H2), was selected for further experiments because it gave rise to a high titer viral production in DBT cells without showing changes in the amino acid sequence in the region of the S protein, although point mutations of the coding region for the S protein were detected at positions 528 (A to C) and 1578 (T to C) as silent mutations, without resulting amino acid substitutions. The stability of the recloned virus regarding virulence and pathogenicity was tested and compared with those obtained from 15 and 21 mice infected in 2007 and 2009, respectively. DBT cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium (DMEM; Nissui, Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Japan Bioserum, Hiroshima, Japan) and cultured at 37\u00b0C with humidity in 5% CO2, as described previously.\n25\n\n",

However, we did not describe this neuropathology because the occurrence of the change was not constant (data not shown) when we used viruses derived from the original stock\n13\n and maintained in our laboratory through passages in DBT cells. The highly mutative nature of MHV\n27\n causes a tendency in mutant viruses to revert to the original neurovirulent phenotype.\n28\n srr7, a mutant isolate from cl\u20102 as a ssr strain, has, to some extent, been showing slightly higher neurovirulence, like its maternal strain (data not shown), whereas averaged neurovirulences and neuropathological characteristics have shown no significant changes. Therefore, we started recloning the virus strain and obtained srr7 (H2), which had the same amino acid sequence as the original isolate\n13\n in the region of the viral surface protein (S protein; see Materials and Methods). Although there could be mutations in the other coding or non\u2010coding regions, which might influence the neurovirulence or host reactions,\n29\n, \n30\n, \n31\n after examination of the viral genome sequence coding S protein, we decided to use srr7 (H2) to study spongiosis induced by viral infection because srr7 differs from cl\u20102 only in one amino acid sequence in the S protein\u2010coding region,\n23\n and, more importantly, the virus exhibited the same induction rate of spongiosis with a similar intensity between the experiments performed in 2007 and 2009 (Fig. 1).",

In vacLesions each vacuole looked smaller and some vacuoles showed back\u2010to\u2010back attachment forming bunches (Fig. 2b,j), each of which consisted of less than 100 vacuoles. The exSpongi exhibited several neuropathological characteristics. First, the lesion was fairly well\u2010demarcated (Fig. 2h). Second, the lesions were accompanied by few or no inflammatory reactions. This phenomenon occurs rather rarely in viral infections with apparent destructive lesions. At a lower magnification of exSpongi, many small nuclei were observed (Fig. 2h), many of which were pyknotic and devoid of cytoplasm at a higher magnification (Fig. 2i). We were unable to characterize the remainder, except for a few macrophages present in the lesions (black arrows in Fig. 2i). Around the blood vessels in and around the exSpongi, almost no inflammatory cell exudation was observed either at the capillary level or at a larger size (thin white arrows in Fig. 2h\u2013j), including in the area with myelinated fibers (Fig. 2j). The third neuropathological characteristic of exSpongi was that neurons looking viable were found in the lesion (white arrowheads in Fig. 2h,i), where vacuoles attached to the neurons directly. The neurons were also well\u2010preserved in vacLesions around the exSpongi (Fig. 2h,j). The close association of small vacuoles with thick eosinophilic walls and the neurons (white arrowheads in Fig. 2i) resembles the vacuoles formed in murine retroviral infection,\n9\n in which the vacuoles are shown as enlarged presynaptic bulbs.\n8\n\n",

Although the initial viral antigen expression was detected in the inflammatory cells in the meninges as early as 12 h pi, followed by infection to the choroid plexus and ependymal cells, as reported previously\n16\n and shown in Fig. 2a,c, they were eliminated from ependymal cells and the SVZ in the latter phase of infection (2, 3). In addition, facing the ventricles a repaired line of ependymal cells with flattened cytoplasm and few cilia was observed (data not shown). Another trace of initial events could be detected as the pronounced activation of GFAP\u2010positive glial cells in and around the SVZ. The gliosis was found to extend deep into the brain parenchyma and again in the middle of the exSpongi (black arrowheads in Fig. 2k) GFAP\u2010antigen expression was less extensive than that seen in the surrounding vacLesions. Even in this area with mild gliosis, astroglial foot processes around the blood vessels were an outstanding feature (Fig. 2l), indicating that a key component of the blood brain barrier had been well\u2010preserved in the exSpongi during the course of the disease, which conspicuously contrasts with pathologies involving an inflammatory perivascular cuff induced by infection with other strains of JHM virus, where there is a disappearance of astrocytes around blood vessels with inflammation followed by degeneration of the astrocytes with swollen cytoplasm around the blood vessels in the initial phase of cell infiltration.\n32\n\n",

In Fig. 2a (the dotted area with the letter b and arrow) a distinct vacLesion developed (2, 3), but viral antigens were not detectable in this area or in the area between the boxed area and ependymal cells which expressed the viral antigens. Occasionally viral antigen\u2010bearing cells in the SVZ were observed extending their cytoplasm to the ventricle (black arrow in Fig. 2c).

Surprisingly, at 48 h pi, we found large vacLesions where viral antigens were not detected (Fig. 2b\u2013g). On the same section as the vacLesions were detected and on successive serial sections, viral antigens were found only in restricted areas, as in the SVZ, where GFAP\u2010positive cells with a peculiar shape, projecting narrow cytoplasm to the ventricular surface and leaving their perikaryon beneath the surface\u2010lining ependymal cells, were found to have been infected (Fig. 2c,e). The shape and localization of these astrocytes corresponded to B\n18\n or B1\n19\n cells, which serve as both stem and niche cells in the SVZ and play critical roles in adult neurogenesis. B cells bear GFAP and have a long basal process that terminates on blood vessels and an apical ending at the ventricle surface, with long cilia projecting into the ventricle,\n18\n which can be a target of infection via infected monocytes that have infiltrated the ventricle during the initial phase of infection.\n16\n It is not plausible for the infected GFAP\u2010positive cells in the SVZ to have a direct effect on spongiogenesis, because the vacLesion is located a long way from the SVZ.",

It is presumed that B cell\u2010originating migratory cells ascend in close contact with the basal lamina along with blood vessels in adulthood.\n19\n The cerebellar cortex receives its blood supply from the meninges that cover the cerebellum, in a different way from the cerebellar white matter. In addition, the granular layer is formed from granular neurons that have migrated from the external granular layer during embryonic and postnatal stages in mice.\n33\n Those astrocytes activated in a large area after being triggered by infection of the SVZ must have communicated with each other, leading to vacuole formation away from the infection sites. This cell\u2010to\u2010cell communication can be facilitated by direct contact between cells through an elongated cytoplasmic projection, as reported for the immunological synapse between leukocytes, especially between dendritic cells and lymphocytes.\n34\n Fine projections of astrocytes are detected in vacLesions, where, at a higher magnification, GFAP\u2010positive foot processes were shown to be closely attached to the vacuolar walls (Fig. 2g). Alternatively, signals can be spread by means of cytokine production, which is observed in all kinds of cell constituting the CNS (central nervous system), including astrocytes and neurons.\n35\n The contribution of microglia\n36\n, \n37\n in this context should not be ignored, but the activation of microglia monitored by F4/80 or CD11b expression was not prominent at 48 h pi.\n16\n Furthermore, it has been reported that neurodegenerative progression can be protected by microglia and monocyte lineages\n38\n which produce neurotrophins.\n39\n, \n40\n\n",
