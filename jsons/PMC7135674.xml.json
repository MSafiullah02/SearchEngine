EBV is mainly transmitted via saliva; however, sexual transmission of the virus is also reported [2]. More than 90% of the adult population worldwide has serological evidence of prior infection with EBV. EBV is capable of causing latent infection within B cells, although other cell types can also be infected (T cells or epithelial cells) [3]. Primary infection with EBV follows a bimodal distribution, with peaks in young childhood and adolescence/early adulthood [4]. In early childhood acute infection is usually asymptomatic, whereas acute infection occurs in adolescence or adulthood, subjects may develop infectious mononucleosis (IM). Following infection with EBV, life-long latent viral presence is established within B cells, with periodic reactivation resulting in virus shedding in the saliva [5], during which times carriers may infect others.",

There is evidence for an association of EBV with a high number of cases of B cell malignancies (Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma and B cell lymphoma in patients with immunosuppressive disease), T cell malignancies (nasal NK-T cell lymphoma, hemophagocytic syndrome T cell lymphoma), and epithelial cell malignancies (nasopharyngeal carcinoma, lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma) [5], [7].",

Apart from indicating a potential role for EBV in the pathogenesis of MS, these findings suggest that the timing of primary EBV infection is an important factor in developing MS. Those who are infected in adolescence or young adulthood have a greater risk of developing MS than those infected during childhood [10]. It has been shown that in high prevalence regions for MS, seroconversion for EBV occurs during or after puberty in a large proportion of the population [11]. A Danish study of more than 25,000 patients with IM observed more than two-fold increased risk of MS in the IM cohort, further confirming the association between IM and MS [12]. They also found that the risk of developing MS was increased for more than 30 years after IM [12].",

            "text": "There is evidence that the EBV serological findings might be associated with clinical and radiological disease activity in MS. EBV reactivation appears to be linked to disease activity in early MS. It has been found that MS patients in clinical relapse, compared to patients in clinical remission, had evidence of peripheral EBV reactivation as evidenced by increased IgM and IgA responses to EBV EA, and detectable EBV DNA in serum [24]. It has also been shown that patients with anti-EBV early antigen (EA) antibodies have more radiological disease activity in terms of gadolinium-enhancing lesions on MRI [25]. Recently MRI activity, as measured by Gd-enhancing lesions, was shown to also be correlated with anti-EBNA1 IgG and EBNA1/virus capsid antigen (VCA) IgG ratio [26]. In addition, anti-EBNA1 IgG titres but not anti-VCA IgG levels were correlated with T2-lesion volume changes over 5 years [26]. Anti-EBNA1 IgG titres were also a predictor of change in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) during the study follow-up period [26]. The latter could imply an association between anti-EBNA1 antibodies and disease progression in MS. Other antibodies against EBV antigens have been correlated with MRI parameters [27], [28]. Anti-VCA IgG levels have been positively correlated with T2 and T1 lesion volume [27], [28], and negatively correlated with atrophy parameters (grey matter fraction-GMF-and brain parenchymal fraction-BPF) [28]. Increased anti-VCA IgG levels were associated with greater decrease in BPF after three years [27], [28], denoting an association between EBV antibodies and loss of brain volume [28]. In this study, anti-EBNA1 IgG was only negatively associated with GMF, and there was no association of anti-EBV-EA IgG antibodies with any of the MRI parameters measured [28]. Although it has been demonstrated that EBV viral load is not associated with overall MS risk [29], [30], EBV viral load has been associated with increased disease activity [29]. It has been shown that in patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) the immune response IgG against EBNA1 but not other EBV antigens correlates with baseline number of T2 lesions, number of lesions meeting the Barkhof criteria at baseline, number of T2 lesions during follow-up, presence of new T2 lesions, and EDSS during a mean follow-up of 7 years. In addition, they showed that increased anti-EBNA1 IgG responses predict conversion to MS based on McDonald criteria [31]. No correlation was found between any EBV IgG responses and the number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions, although this finding was based on a small proportion of their studied patients.",

These features allow the virus to evade immune recognition and hence prevent viral clearance. Latent EBV infection of B cells is associated with expression of approximately 11 genes during cell proliferation. In order to facilitate onward transmission of EBV to other cells, the virus is able to transiently switch to the lytic phase, during which approximately 80 genes are expressed. Memory EBV-specific T cells are produced following primary infection with EBV and maintain immunosurveillance of infected B cells, but they are unable to eliminate all cells latently infected with EBV.

The development of in situ hybridisation studies and PCR allowed further investigation of these viruses, failing to demonstrate the consistent presence of measles, other Paramyxovirus or coronavirus [58], [59], [60]. More recently, various members of the herpesvirus family were considered as possible candidates involved in MS pathogenesis. Herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and human herpesvirus-6 have been found in the brains of both MS patients and control patients using both PCR and Southern blot hybridisation [61], [62]. The demonstration of different viral infections in MS brains and the intrathecal synthesis of antibodies directed against several viruses led to the hypothesis that they may not be a single specific underlying viral trigger to MS, but that several common viral infections may play a role in the pathological cascade [63], [64].

They used a wide range of techniques, including in situ hybridisation for EBER, immunohistochemistry for LMP1 and EBNA2 and quantitative real-time PCR to detect genomic EBV and EBER1 RNA in MS lesions [68]. In addition, 12 specimens were examined for B cell infiltration or aggregates within the meninges. B cell meningeal infiltration was found to be either low or absent, but 3 of these cases did have B cell aggregates within the brain parenchyma [68]. EBV was undetectable in these samples by in situ hybridisation. Real-time PCR detected low-level EBV infection in only 2 of the cases [68]. Peferoen et al., made similar observations, they undertook a study screening 632 specimens from 94 MS patients, including 11 patients who died before the age of 50, in addition to studying 12 blocks used in the Serafini study [69], [67]. Sixteen of the patients had rich B cell infiltrates, although follicle-like structures were not seen in any specimen. EBER was detected only in one tissue specimen by in situ hybridisation, which also showed lytic cycle markers. Real-time PCR for EBV genome and encoded RNA were negative in all tissue examined [69].

Active lesions with over-expression of IFN-\u03b1 had been pre-selected. In situ hybridisation showed EBER+ cells in the active MS lesions and also in the case of ADEM [71].

Further research is urgently needed as we are still trying to optimise molecular techniques to identify persistent viral infections in brain tissue, the detection of which is often hampered by post-mortem delay and tissue fixation. A working consensus on lesion staging may further help interpretation of pathological findings. It would appear that EBV+ cells can be detected in MS brains, mainly within active lesions, but far less frequently than has been reported at times, and that the presence of these EBV+ cells may not be specific to the MS brain.",

Since EBV has yet again emerged as a candidate of interest, it may take all our effort to see whether it is deserving of its\u2019 place in the limelight.",
