            "text": "Effective response to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic requires genomic resources and bioinformatics tools for genomic epidemiology and surveillance studies that involve characterizing full-length viral genomes, identifying origins of infections, determining the relatedness of viral infections, performing phylogenetic analyses, and monitoring the continuous evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes. The Children's Hospital, Los Angeles (CHLA) COVID-19 Analysis Research Database (CARD) (https://covid19.cpmbiodev.net/) is a comprehensive genomic resource that provides access to full-length SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes and associated meta-data for over 18,000 (as of May 10, 2020) isolates collected from global sequencing repositories and the sequencing performed at the Center for Personalized Medicine (CPM) at CHLA. Reference phylogenetic trees of global and USA viral isolates were constructed and are periodically updated using selected high quality SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences. These provide the baseline and analytical context for identifying the origin of a viral infection, as well as the relatedness of SARS-CoV-2 genomes of interest. A web-based and interactive Phylogenetic Tree Browser supports flexible tree manipulation and advanced analysis based on keyword search while highlighting time series animation, as well as subtree export for graphical representation or offline exploration. A Virus Genome Tracker accepts complete or partial SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence, compares it against all available sequences in the database (>18,000 at time of writing), detects and annotates the variants, and places the new viral isolate within the global or USA phylogenetic contexts based upon variant profiles and haplotype comparisons, in a few seconds. The generated analysis can potentially aid in genomic surveillance to trace the transmission of any new infection. Using CHLA CARD, we demonstrate the identification of a candidate outbreak point where 13 of 31 CHLA internal isolates may have originated. We also discovered multiple indels of unknown clinical significance in the orf3a gene.",

Data were downloaded in various formats depending on the exact implementations of these external resources. The retrieved data were post-processed, merged, reformatted, and loaded into a MySQL database. Within this database, a master table is created to store merged and normalized viral meta-data from these resources based upon a template that is compatible with NextStrain's meta-data table. This master table is continuously updated to ensure CHLA CARD provides the most up-to-date and comprehensive SARS-CoV-2 data to end users. The viral genome sequences and metadata are cross-examined to identify and to remove duplicate entries present in multiple resources.

For missense variants, the number is highest in orf1ab polyprotein, in 1,626 Non-USA and 853 USA isolates. This is expected because this is a large gene (21,290 base pairs or 71.1% of the virus genome) (Figure 1) . The shorter surface glycoprotein S gene which is only 3,822 base pairs in length, contains about 1/5 of the missense variants or 340 for Non-USA and 143 for USA isolates, at a similar variant density as orf1ab. It is noteworthy that envelope protein gene orf3a's in-frame deletions and frameshift deletions are only identified in isolates from USA (12), Australia (6), UK (5), China (5) and Spain (2) but not in other countries. There are recurrent deletions around 26157-26161 bases, including 5 isolates having frameshift deletions and 3 isolates having inframe deletions. The 25492-ACGATAC-A 2-aa deletion ORF3a:p.34-36TIP>T neighbors sites required for SARS-CoV O-glycosylation (AA 27, 28, 32 and 34; Oostra et al., 2006). The frameshift mutation is expected to have a more significant impact. Further work will be required to ascertain whether these are caused simply by spurious sequencing artefacts or to confirm whether they have any potential clinical significance (e.g. associations with varied host immune responses). Phylogenetic Analysis and Reference Phylogenetic Trees. Viral genome sequences are quality benchmarked by counting the missing bases, the length deviation from the reference sequence (NC_045512.2), and the quality scores (if available). When constructing different subsets of global or country-specific FASTA datasets, the demographic meta-data is used as an inclusion filter for the proper sequences. The reference sequence (NC_045512.2) is always included, and MN996532 (bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013) coronavirus sequence is included to serve as the outgroup to root the phylogenetic tree. Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) was conducted with MAFFT version 7.460 (Katoh et al, 2002; Katoh and Toh, 2008) using speed-oriented method FFT-NS-i (iterative refinement method, two cycles) optimized for large datasets. The resulting MSA files were visually examined. All alignments with gaps over 3 bases, or smaller gaps that resulted from inserted \"N\" (missing) bases, are removed. The 5'-and 3'-end bases are trimmed because they are often of lower quality. The evolutionary history was inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method and General Time Reversible model (Nei and Kumar, 2000) in MEGA X (Kumar et al., 2018) . Initial trees for the heuristic search were obtained automatically by applying Neighbor-Joining and BioNJ algorithms to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated using the Maximum Composite Likelihood (MCL) approach, and then selecting the topology with superior log likelihood value. All positions with over 2% alignment gaps, missing data, and ambiguous bases were excluded. The trees with maximum likelihood were kept as the reference trees for visualization at the web portal. These trees are periodically updated as new genome sequence data are acquired.",

These findings, along with the geographic location, the collection date, and the patient contact history may aid in the tracing of transmission route.

            "text": "Angeles. The CHLA CPM sequenced 31 viral isolates with its SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing research assay (Pandey et al., in preparation). We analyzed the complete genomes of these isolates by two strategies: 1) Virus Genome Tracker which placed these 31 genomes into the global isolate context in a few minutes, and 2) a refining strategy that merged them onto the reference USA phylogenetic tree, see Figure 2 . The Virus Genome Tracker strategy using the consensus sequences correctly picked similar external isolates for refined phylogenetic analysis: identical-variant/Level 1 matches (EPI_ISL_415543 & EPI_ISL_415544; Figure 2) , and descendent/Level 2 match (EPI_ISL_424890 & MT325610). Merging these results onto the reference USA phylogenetic tree we could demonstrate that there is a branching point where 13 of 31 cases center around and make up 9 out of 13 branches from this point. This point is in the middle of the transmission route, inferred from traversing the phylogenetic tree, below a large number of Washington State samples. Among these cases were three members from the same household. This provides a real case example as to how the Virus Genome Tracker and the CHLA CARD facilitated the identification of similar isolates, which can serve as the proxy to query isolates and to place them onto the prebuilt phylogenetic trees in just a few minutes. Customized URLs to the reference trees are automatically generated by Virus Genome Tracker for visualization and exploration. ",

Keyword Quick Filter\". Composite filter is automatically generated when users select values from multiple drop-down lists. 1.3. Alternatively, click the \"Precise Search\" button. The search results will contain only those records that exactly match each of the multiple categories from drop-down lists selected at the last step. 1.4. In addition, records can be further filtered by manually typing one or more keywords from the other columns in the search box at \"2. Keyword Quick Filter\". Keywords can be partial, and can be a combination of keywords from multiple columns. Add \"!\" after a word to enable whole word search. Note that the keywords can match any columns shown in the table, whereas the \"Precise Search\" function matches exactly the same column. 1.5. Save the filtered results by clicking on the \"Export Filtered Table to csv\" button to save as a csv file to be opened with Microsoft Excel or similar tools.",
