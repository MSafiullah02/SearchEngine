            "text": "The discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs) revealed a new dimension in post\u2010transcriptional regulation of gene expression. miRNAs are small, noncoding RNA molecules of ~22 nucleotides, which typically repress messenger RNAs (mRNAs) by binding to their 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) (reviewed in 1, 2, 3, 4). miRNAs are transcribed as primary miRNA transcripts (pri\u2010miRNAs), which contain a hairpin\u2010like structure that will produce the mature miRNAs 5. Most miRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II from independent promoters, analogous to typical protein\u2010coding genes 5. However, transcription can also be dependent on RNA polymerase III when the miRNA is located downstream of repetitive elements such as Alu elements 6. Alternatively, miRNAs can be embedded within long noncoding RNA or in an intron of a protein\u2010coding gene, which releases the pri\u2010miRNA in the process of splicing 7. In this case, miRNA transcription is coupled to its host gene. Furthermore, several miRNAs are organized in genomic clusters, which produce a single polycistronic primary transcript that contains the hairpins of several miRNAs. Typically, these miRNAs have related biological functions 8. To form a mature miRNA, the pri\u2010miRNA hairpin is the substrate for two subsequent cleavage steps by members of the RNase III family. In the nucleus, it is recognized by the RNase III enzyme Drosha to produce the pre\u2010miRNA, a ~70\u2010nt\u2010long precursor molecule, which is then exported to the cytoplasm by exportin\u20105. Because the structure of the processed pre\u2010miRNA is the signal for nuclear export, the transport is independent of capping or polyadenylation status of the primary transcript 7.",

One of the strands is then incorporated into a protein complex termed \u2018the RNA\u2010induced silencing complex (RISC)\u2019, which binds to the 3\u2032UTR of mRNAs that contain target sites for the miRNA 7. The specificity of the interaction is determined by a stretch of six to eight nucleotides in the 5\u2032 end of the miRNA, its so\u2010called seed region, which has perfect complementarity to the target mRNA. The rest of the miRNA sequence is less complementary to the target mRNA, which results in a bulged structure 9. The central RISC component, a protein of the Argonaute family, can interact with a range of regulatory factors, such as GW182 and Rck/p54, which link the RISC to processing (P) bodies, where factors involved in mRNA degradation and translational repression are concentrated 10. As a consequence, targeted mRNA molecules can be degraded following deadenylation and decapping and/or translationally repressed by inhibition of initiation and elongation 11, 12. The relative importance of mRNA degradation versus translation inhibition is still a matter of debate but, given that these are highly coupled processes, it is likely that both are important and influence each other 13.",

A high expression level is seen in cells of the myeloid lineage, with granulocytes showing the highest levels 18 (see Fig. 1). Furthermore, miR\u2010223 is upregulated during retinoic acid (RA)\u2010induced differentiation of promyelocytic leukaemia cell lines NB4 and HL60, as well as in primary leukaemic cells. This is caused by the induction of miR\u2010223 gene expression by the myeloid transcription factors PU.1 and CAAT/enhancer\u2010binding protein (C/EBP) \u03b2 19, 20. The nuclear factor I\u2010A (NFI\u2010A) can maintain lower levels of miR\u2010223 and stabilize the undifferentiated state of precursor cells as it competes for binding with C/EBP\u03b1, another strong inducer of miR\u2010223 transcription 20, 21. It is interesting that both NFI\u2010A and C/EBP\u03b2 are direct targets of miR\u2010223, thus forming negative feedback loops 20, 22. Fazi et al. also showed that overexpression of miR\u2010223 is sufficient to induce markers of differentiation in a myeloid precursor cell line and that inhibition of miR\u2010223 reduces the efficiency of RA\u2010induced differentiation 20. Taken together, upregulation of miR\u2010223 is clearly an important element of granulopoiesis, which is coordinated by the combined action of different myeloid transcription factors (Fig. 1).",

During RA\u2010induced differentiation of leukaemic cell lines, miR\u2010223 appears to bind directly to partly complementary genomic sequences in the NFI\u2010A promoter.

Of interest, miR\u2010223\n\u2212/Y mice did not fail to produce granulocytes; instead, granulocyte numbers were increased. The authors attributed this to the deregulation of Mef2c, a transcription factor that drives granulocyte\u2013monocyte progenitor proliferation and is targeted by miR\u2010223. Indeed, conditional deletion of Mef2c in the myeloid lineage of miR\u2010223\n\u2212/Y animals results in normal numbers of granulocytes. miR\u2010223\n\u2212/Y mice were also reported to produce hyperactive neutrophils and present with spontaneous lung inflammation, which was not mediated by Mef2c. Therefore, miR\u2010223 seems to be involved in the regulation of the early and late stages of granulopoiesis, as well as in the homeostasis of mature neutrophils. These findings were independently confirmed by reconstituting mice with bone marrow that expresses a miR\u2010223 sponge construct, which acts as a miR\u2010223 inhibitor. This study showed that impairing miR\u2010223 function in the haematopoietic compartment replicates the phenotype of the miR\u2010223\n\u2212/Y mouse 25.",

Together with other miRNAs, miR\u2010223 fine\u2010tunes the differentiation of myeloid precursors into either granulocytes or monocytes. As described above, miR\u2010223 is strongly induced by C/EBP\u03b1, a transcription factor that drives granulocyte differentiation. As miR\u2010223 targets the NFI\u2010A mRNA, proliferation of myeloid precursors is reduced upon C/EBP\u03b1 activation, and the differentiation programme can be initiated 20. Similarly, during osteoclast differentiation from precursors of the myeloid lineage, miR\u2010223 upregulation by PU.1 is important to repress NFI\u2010A, which would otherwise inhibit differentiation 26. The importance for myeloid differentiation has also been demonstrated using an antagomiR inhibitor of miR\u2010223, which abolishes GM\u2010CSF (granulocyte\u2013macrophage colony\u2010stimulating factor)\u2010induced differentiation of monocytes and PMA (phorbol\u201012\u2010myristate\u201013\u2010acetate)\u2010induced differentiation of THP1 cells 27. Interestingly, the authors also showed that miR\u2010223 is enriched in microvesicles shed from differentiated macrophages and that these vesicles are sufficient to induce differentiation in monocytes. An increasing number of studies show that microvesicles (exosomes or microparticles) are a means of intercellular communication 28 that can even act over long distances because they can be found in the circulation. Even though blocked differentiation by miR\u2010223 inhibition implies a positive role of the miRNA on macrophage differentiation, we and others have shown that miR\u2010223 is downregulated in macrophages compared with monocytes 24, 29, 30 (see Fig. 1). Nevertheless, the strong effect of miR\u2010223 inhibition described above suggests that a low functional level of the miRNA is essential for monocyte differentiation.",

With regard to the regulation of proliferation, LMO2 is probably the main effector 22. Most recently, miR\u2010223 expression was found to increase during eosinophil differentiation, such that eosinophil production is increased in miR\u2010223\u2212/\u2212 mice, probably due to effects on IGF1R (insulin\u2010like growth factor 1 receptor) 33.",

Furthermore, the infiltrating macrophages expressed higher levels of markers of the classically activated pro\u2010inflammatory phenotype (M1), suggesting a defect in macrophage polarization. On a molecular level, this deregulation may be partly due to the novel miR\u2010223 target Pknox1. By targeting Pknox1, miR\u2010223 helps to steer the activation pattern of macrophages towards the alternative M2 phenotype.

As monocytes differentiate into macrophages (or dendritic cells), NLRP3, an important protein for the processing of the IL\u20101\u03b2 and IL\u201018, is upregulated, although its mRNA levels are downregulated 30, 35. This coincides with lower expression of miR\u2010223 in mature myeloid cells. As miR\u2010223 can target the NLRP3 3\u2032UTR, it can prevent translation early in the myeloid lineage. Given the high miR\u2010223 expression levels, the miRNA is likely to be an important regulator of the NLRP3 inflammasome in neutrophils 35. Other groups have also found that miR\u2010223 may influence IL\u20101\u03b2 production, in this case due to an effect on STAT3 36. miR\u2010223 downregulation was found to promote the production of IL\u20101\u03b2 and IL\u20106 at a transcriptional level. Furthermore, miR\u2010223 cooperated with miR\u201015a and miR\u201016 to enhance noncanonical NF\u2010\u03baB signalling during macrophage differentiation. These miRNAs were all found to target the inhibitor of NF\u2010\u03baB kinase \u03b1 (IKK\u03b1). As the levels of all three miRNA decrease during macrophage differentiation, repression of IKK\u03b1 is relieved and NF\u2010\u03baB signalling increases 29. miR\u2010223 expression also changes when other cell types are activated, for example in natural killer (NK) cells treated with IL\u201015.

More specifically, miR\u2010223 was strongly upregulated in r1918 infection and only moderately upregulated in control influenza infection. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a twenty\u2010first\u2010century pandemic infection with typical clinical features of pulmonary fibrosis and lung failure that led to significant mortality, is caused by the coronavirus SARS\u2010CoV. Although SARS\u2010CoV cannot infect or replicate in fully differentiated cells, it is possible to study the virus in infected bronchoalveolar stem cells 49. Using this method, Mallick et al. showed that miR\u2010223 amongst other miRNAs is downregulated during infection. Furthermore, they demonstrated potential targets of miR\u2010223 in both the virus (N protein) and the host (CCR1), although these targets remain to be validated. In another study, it was found that miR\u2010223 is elevated in serum from patients with chronic type B hepatitis, to a similar extent as in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), suggesting it may be a marker of liver injury 50. Although it is not clear how higher levels in the serum relate to the expression levels of this miRNA in cells, it is tempting to speculate from the finding that miR\u2010223 is downregulated in HCC and that it may also be downregulated in chronic type B hepatitis. As discussed above, miR\u2010223 may act as a negative regulator of inflammation, which could explain the chronic inflammatory response in the liver if miR\u2010223 is repressed.",

Given its predominance in microvesicles from various cell types, it can play an important role in the crosstalk between cancer cells and the microenvironment. In many cases, miR\u2010223 seems to function as a tumour\u2010suppressive miRNA, targeting predominantly oncogenic effectors and being silenced in cancer cells. However, in other cases, miR\u2010223 is overexpressed.
