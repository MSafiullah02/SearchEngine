A central aspect in the directive is the reference concept which is used to assess the ecological impairment of sites (e.g. stream segments of a particular size) and to assess recovery of sites previously identified as impaired. According to the directive, reference conditions are described as \u2018a state in the present or in the past corresponding to very low pressure without the effects of major industrialization, urbanization and intensification of agriculture, and with only very minor modification of physicochemistry, hydromorphology and biology\u2019 (Wallin, Wiederholm & Johnson, 2003).",

Several approaches have been used to establish reference values, such as the condition of systems in the absence of significant human disturbance, the best available sites within an area and the condition that sites might achieve if they were better managed (Stoddard et al., 2006). One of most common approaches to describe reference conditions is to quantify the biological condition at a set of sites that represent either minimally (MDC) or least (LDC) disturbed conditions (sensu\nStoddard et al., 2006; Bailey, Norris & Reynoldson, 2004; Chaves et al., 2006).",

Although both theoretical and empirical work has focused on the characterization of pressure gradients to assess impacts on biological communities (e.g. Fore, Karr & Wisseman, 1996; Hering et al., 2006; Johnson et al., 2007), few studies have focused on understanding the variability of relatively unimpaired sites. This is unfortunate since according to the EU directive it is the biological communities at these sites which will be used to evaluate the degree of impairment. Furthermore, pressure\u2010impact relationships may not cover all types of single or combined pressures affecting biological communities. For example, stream macrophytes are well known for their response to nutrient pollution (see Birk, Korte & Hering, 2006), but the effect of other types of impairment are less well studied (Baattrup\u2010Pedersen & Riis, 1999; Wright et al., 2003; Daniel, Bernez & Haury, 2006; O\u2019Hare et al., 2006; Pedersen, Baattrup\u2010Pedersen & Madsen, 2006). Consequently, the establishment of screening criteria and reliable thresholds for the selection of MDC or LDC sites for macrophyte assemblages is difficult.",

            "text": "The use of expert judgement for selecting MDC or LDC sites also has many weaknesses. First, bias may be introduced by focusing on species and assemblages that presently occur in best available sites. In lowland areas with intensive land use this bias may be significant, and species assemblages may differ substantially between the best sites and true reference sites. For example, several Potamogeton species such as P. alpinus Balbis, P. lucens L., P. polygonifolius Pourret and P. praelongus Wulf. were formerly widely distributed, but now many of these species are near or are extinct in lowland streams in several regions of Europe (Bagg\u00f8e & Ravn, 1896; Raunki\u00e6r, 1895\u201099; Mountford, 1994; work cited in Preston, 1995; Riis & Sand\u2010Jensen, 2001). Second, it is difficult to avoid subjectivity when using expert judgement. Thus limited knowledge on reference assemblages implies that the perception of what the reference condition represents differs among experts (Birk et al., 2006).",

We used two approaches to establish a reference network for macrophyte assemblages in Danish streams. First, we examined the possibility of using stream sites from regions in Latvia, Lithuania and Poland with less intensive land use. These three countries are similar to Denmark in topography and climate, and all four countries belong to the Central Baltic River Geographical Intercalibration Group (GIG). Second, we examined the possibility of using macrophyte assemblages in these regions in the development of a guiding image for the identification of potential reference sites in Denmark (Stoddard et al., 2006). We see this guiding image as an extension to the expert judgement, building also on empirical data. Both approaches were validated using historical records for Danish macrophyte assemblages (see Riis & Sand\u2010Jensen, 2001 for the full reference list). These historic data provide a unique opportunity to gain insight into community structure and species occurrence before extensive human perturbation and therefore may be particularly valuable in the development of a guiding image for reference assemblages.",

First, we used a subset of the macrophyte data collected from mid\u2010sized lowland streams as part of the EU\u2010funded project STAR (Furse et al., 2006). This data set included stream sites classified as reference sites using a list of a priori exclusion criteria (Hering et al., 2003; Nijboer et al., 2004). Four sites were situated in Germany, seven in Poland, three in Sweden, four in Denmark and seven in Latvia. We chose to combine data from sites in Germany and Sweden as well as from the Baltic region and Poland to obtain a better measure of reference assemblages for the mid\u2010sized lowland stream type. Second, we used data from 15 stream sites in Latvia that had been classified as reference (Springe et al., 2006) and from 13 stream sites in Denmark that are considered as LDC sites (Baattrup\u2010Pedersen, Larsen & Riis, 2002; Pedersen et al., 2006). Third, new data were collected from 10 streams in Lithuania. These sites were selected to study the possibility of using data from an area which has experienced less intensive land use compared to Denmark. Lithuania and Denmark are topographically and climatically similar (average precipitation in Lithuania 661 mm compared to 712 mm in Denmark; average temperature 6 \u00b0C in Klaipeda compared to 7.7 \u00b0C in Denmark). The selected sites can be regarded as LDC sites, with intensive land use varying between 9\u201357% of total catchment area. The geographic location of the sampling sites is shown in Fig. 1.",

A 100\u2010m long stream reach was surveyed and macrophyte recordings were made in approximately 250 plots (25 \u00d7 25 cm) adjacently placed along 10 cross\u2010sectional transects in each reach. A cover score was allocated to each species present in the plots using an abundance scale: 1 = 1\u20135%, 2 = 6\u201325%, 3 = 26\u201350%, 4 = 51\u201375%, 5 = 76\u2013100%. Species abundance was then calculated as the sum of cover scores to the maximum score sum (i.e. the number of plots multiplied by the maximal score of five). Water depth was measured to the nearest centimetre at a fixed point in each of the plots and the mean depth was calculated from these recordings. The dominant substratum type was categorized as stone (>60 mm diameter), gravel (3\u201360 mm), coarse sand (1\u20133 mm), fine sand (0.25\u20131 mm), silt (<0.25 mm), hard clay or peat in each plot. The frequency of the various substratum types was calculated from these recordings. Stream width was measured at each transect and averaged to give the mean width of the stream reach. Stream water alkalinity was determined by potentiometric end\u2010point titration with HCL on 100 ml samples of stream water (Hutchinson, 1957). The macrophyte, depth and substratum data were further processed into broader categories to enable comparison with the STAR dataset that were sampled using the AQEM/STAR site protocol and the MTR protocol (available at http://www.eu-star.at under \u2018Protocols\u2019).

(Table 4). These three groups were excluded from further analysis. Group 1 was species rich (25 species), consisting primarily of amphibious (n = 5) and terrestrial (n = 18) species which are able to grow emergent within streams (Table 4). The terrestrial species included both tall monocots and smaller dicots. The most common species in group 1 were associated with the land\u2013water ecotone, namely, Phalaris arundinacea L. (found in 57% of the streams sites), Myosotis spp. (51%), Berula erecta (Hudson) (40%) and Glyceria maxima (Hartman) (29%). Group 3 was predominated by primarily submerged species such as Sparganium emersum Rehman (83%), Elodea canadensis L. C. Rich (54%), Callitriche sp. (44%) and Ranunculus sp. (43%). Two amphibious species (S. erectum L., 59% and Veronica anagallis\u2010aquatica L., 49%) were also important species within this group, whereas terrestrial species had a more scattered occurrence. Group 4 was predominated by amphibious and terrestrial species, but submerged species, such as P. perfoliatus L. and Myriophyllum spicatum L., were also present. Similar to group 1, the most common species in group 4 (i.e. Mentha aquatica L., 35%, Equisetum fluviatile L., 25% and Iris pseudocaris L., 19%) were associated with the land\u2013water ecotone. Group 5 consisted of floating\u2010leaved, submerged as well as terrestrial species, with Fontinalis antipyretica (41%), Nuphear lutea (L.) Sm. (30%), Scirpus sylvaticus L.

First, predictions were based on the co\u2010occurrence of several species as opposed to comparisons based on presence/absence of individual species. Interpretation of the historic data is thus less affected by low and variable sampling effort and different sampling methodologies compared to those used today. Both differences in sample effort and methodology are often considered to limit the use of historic data. Second, species used in predictions comprised both disturbance\u2010insensitive species that are currently widely distributed (e.g. E. canadensis, S. emersum and B. erecta) and disturbance\u2010sensitive species that have undergone marked declines (e.g. P. alpinus, Butomus umbellatus L. and A. plantago\u2010aquatica: Riis & Sand\u2010Jensen, 2001; Baattrup\u2010Pedersen et al., 2004).

These groups can be regarded as subgroupings to the lowland stream reference community previously identified (C6 \u2013 see Baattrup\u2010Pedersen et al., 2006). We were unable to discriminate among\u2010group variability in macrophyte assemblages using physical stream site and size\u2010related variables. But we found a clear geographical pattern in species composition, in particular for groups 1 and 5. Group 1 sites were more abundant in the most western parts of the region, which included western Jutland, an area that remained ice\u2010free during the last glaciation, whereas group 5 sites were most abundant in the eastern lowlands of the Baltic region and Poland.",

This zone is particularly well developed in highly mobile streams located in regions with glacio\u2010fluvial outwash plains and sandy soils which are typical of western Denmark. We found that the group 1 assemblage was similar to the Myriophyllum\u2010community described by Riis et al. (2000), with the concurrent presence of Glyceria fluitans (L.) R. Br., P. natans L. and Myriophyllum alterniflorum DC. The Myriophyllum\u2010community has been found to be closely associated with low alkalinity in Danish streams (Riis et al., 2000). Earlier studies have shown how differences in physiology and use of bicarbonate and/or carbon dioxide in photosynthesis affect the distribution of macrophytes in streams (Riis et al., 2000; Dodkins, Rippey & Hale, 2005; Feijoo & Lombardo, 2007). We suggest that the decline in the abundance of group 1 species from the western part of Denmark to the eastern parts in Latvia and Lithuania is associated with changes in stream water alkalinity. Alkalinity of streams situated in western Jutland has previously been found to be lower (mean 0.7 mmol L\u22121) than streams in the eastern part of Jutland (1.7 mmol L\u22121) and on the Isles of Funen and Seeland (4.9 mmol L\u22121 and 3.6 mmol L\u22121, respectively) (Riis, unpubl. data).

Most of the species that belong to this group can also be found in contemporary Danish stream vegetation. However, many of these species have declined, i.e. M. spicatum, P. alpinus and B. umbellatus (Riis & Sand\u2010Jensen, 2002; Baattrup\u2010Pedersen et al., 2004) and are now often only abundant locally but not regionally. These distribution patterns have been attributed to habitat degradation (eutrophication and hydromorphological impairment) leading to spatial restrictions, and future projections indicate further declines if habitats continue to be become impaired (Riis & Sand\u2010Jensen, 2002). The decline in the abundance of group 5 species from Poland and the Baltic region to Denmark is therefore likely associated with differences in the intensity of human impacts on the stream integrity, a finding that is also supported by the close association of this group with the historic data (discussed below).",

In particular, we were able to identify groups 4 and 5 that were closely associated with the species\u2010predicted site scores of the historic records. These groups could therefore contribute to the guiding image for the identification of potential reference sites within Denmark. Furthermore, we propose that this assemblage\u2010based approach can be a valuable supplement to other approaches, such as the use screening criteria for pressures or impacts (CIS 2.3 REFCOND) or the use of the best available sites as surrogates for the true reference condition. Thus by integrating macrophyte assemblages in the screening for potential reference sites, the weaknesses associated with the use of thresholds for pressures or impacts that are poorly documented is reduced. In addition, a combined approach probably also gives the most reliable description of the reference assemblages. Many species that were formerly widespread are now found in marginal habitats (Riis & Sand\u2010Jensen, 2002; Baattrup\u2010Pedersen et al., 2004) and their dispersal within and among stream systems is most likely restricted. Therefore, these species may not be present locally in reaches that have suitable environmental conditions and fulfil screening thresholds simply because of regional declines. Neglecting these species would result in a distorted description of reference assemblages, thereby affecting stream assessments.",
