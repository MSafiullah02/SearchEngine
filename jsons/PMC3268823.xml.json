            "text": "Elicitation of potent, broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) against HIV-1 by immunization remains a challenge. We had previously hypothesized that HIV-1 may use conserved structures that cannot initiate immune responses because of the existence of \u201choles\u201d in the human germline B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire, i.e., lack of germline antibodies capable of binding those structures [1]. In support of this hypothesis, we showed that germline-like antibodies corresponding most closely to known HIV-1 bnAbs such as b12, 2G12 and 2F5 lack measurable binding to the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) [1]. This observation led to investigation of the maturation pathways of two HIV-1 bnAbs b12 and X5 [2], whose structures and functions are well known [3], [4], as well as to the identification and characterization of several human IgM-derived monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) selected from a large phage-displayed na\u00efve human antibody library constructed from 59 healthy donors [5]. These studies demonstrated that germline intermediates corresponding to b12 also fail to bind the Env with high affinity, whereas the X5 putative germline-like predecessor antibody and other IgM-derived mAbs which diverged less from their corresponding germlines have high binding affinity for the Env; however, the latter enhanced or did not potently neutralize infection by HIV-1 primary isolates. Further studies on B cell lineages and maturation pathways of HIV-1 bnAbs may sidestep this impediment to HIV-1 vaccine developments [6].",

Human umbilical cord blood B lymphocytes that presumably have not been exposed to exogenous antigens have been used as a source of naturally-occurring germline or minimally-mutated pre-immune antibodies [10], [11]. For this reason, cord blood-derived IgM libraries might serve as a relevant source for selecting the closest germline antibodies corresponding to broadly neutralizing mAbs if they exhibit binding to target antigens. The current study addresses the hypothesis that the human cord blood does not contain high-affinity binders to HIV-1, although it has high-affinity antibodies against other human infectious agents such as SARS CoV and henipaviruses.",

Although large-scale sequencing of a cord-blood derived IgM antibody repertoire revealed relatively high diversity, there was no enrichment observed by sequential panning against the Envs. However, considerable specific enrichments were seen when the libraries were panned against the RBD in which the antibodies produced were very close to their putative germline predecessors.

These sequences were analyzed using the program JoinSolver [18], and those which it found to be the result of productive rearrangement and likely to yield functional products formed the data sets for further analysis. Using the outputs from JoinSolver, germline diversity, the heavy chain complementarity determining region 3 (HCDR3) lengths, and the number of mutations compared to the closest germline match from the V(D)J families were obtained for each sequence. Translated heavy and light chain variable segment library sequences were aligned using ClustalX2 [19] and trimmed to equivalent lengths within each group: VH codons 3\u201391, V\u03ba codons 9\u201388, and V\u03bb codons 3\u201388.

The microplate wells were inoculated with 50 \u03bcl per well of MPBS containing 1010 PFU of pooled phage purified from each round of panning for 2 h at room temperature. Following 4 washes with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST), bound phage was detected by adding 50 \u03bcl of 1:5000 diluted HRP-conjugated mouse anti-M13 antibody (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) to each well.

When the sequences from both libraries were combined, 1549 (99.3%), 780 (83.5%) and 745 (62.0%) sequences of VH, V\u03ba, and V\u03bb, respectively, were unique. The combined cord blood antibody repertoire was then analyzed for gene usage, HCDR3 length, and somatic mutations compared to the closest germline counterparts. The heavy chain V (HV) regions were found to derive from all 7 HV germline families (Fig. 1\nA), and contained representatives from 45 subfamilies found in the IMGT database [22]. All heavy chain D (HD) and J (HJ) gene families were found but in different proportions (Fig. 1B and C). The lengths of HCDR3 ranged from 6 to 26 amino acid residues and the mode was a HCDR3 length of 14 (Fig. 1D). For V\u03ba, the V regions, KVs, were identified from gene families KV1\u20136 but KV7 was absent (Fig. 1E); the J regions, KJs, were distributed among all five gene families, KJ1\u20135 (Fig. 1F). For V\u03bb, all the V regions, LVs, were present except for three LV gene families, LV4, LV10 and LV11 (Fig. 1G); the J regions, LJs, were mostly distributed in LJ1\u20133 gene families while LJ4 and LJ5 were absent (Fig. 1H).",

Of the HVs, 21.5% were the same as germline sequences; 39.2% of the sequences contained only one AA mutation; the remaining 39.3% had two or more AA mutations, but very few sequences with more than 8 mutations were found (Fig. 2\nA). In contrast, the light chains were significantly less mutated, with 57.6% and 73.0% of the KVs and the LVs, respectively, giving translations identical to germlines. The numbers of mutations occurring in the J regions of heavy and light chains were also calculated. Similarly to what was observed with the variable regions, relatively more mutations were observed in the HJs than in the KJs and LJs (Fig. 2B). The mutations in D regions were not estimated because of the difficulties in determining the D gene germlines for many antibodies due to the events of recombination involving insertion and deletion. These results suggest that the sequence diversity of the libraries is likely to be high although the light chains appear to be less diverse than the heavy chains, and the libraries exhibit low levels of somatic hypermutations.",

            "text": "Previously, it was noted that the known bnAbs against HIV-1 were highly divergent from their germline sequences in contrast to bnAbs against SARS CoV and henipaviruses which were less diversified, possessing a limited number of mutations. In addition, it was found that germline-like predecessors of several HIV-1 bnAbs lack measurable binding to HIV-1 Envs [1]. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that there is a scarcity or absence of high affinity binders to HIV-1 Envs in the minimally somatically-hypermutated human cord blood antibody repertoire, whereas high affinity antibodies against other human infectious agents including SARS CoV and henipaviruses can be easily found. To test this hypothesis, the combined cord blood library of ml32 and ml33was panned against gp140Con-s, a synthetic Env designed by aligning the consensus Env sequences of group M [15], and the Hendra virus protein sG in parallel. After four rounds of panning, enrichment and binding specificity of pooled phage were determined by ppELISA. Interestingly, significant and specific enrichment was observed with selection against sG only (Fig. 3\n). In a separate experiment, the mixed library was panned against another Env, gp120Bal, and simultaneously the RBD. In line with previous observations, no marked enrichment was achieved with panning against gp120Bal while considerable and specific enrichment was seen when the library was panned against the RBD (Fig. 3). These results support the hypothesis and suggest that HIV-1 Envs could have evolved strategies to avoid binding to the germline repertoire by presenting epitopes unsuitable for minimally somatically-diversified human antibodies to bind with, thereby denying them the chance to bind with high affinity. This strategy may represent a way exploited by the virus to escape from strong immune responses.",

This unique clone, designated m390, contains gene products of HV3\u201330 and KV2\u201328 in the heavy and light chain V regions, respectively, (Fig. 4\nA). M390 has only 2 AA mutations each in the V regions of both heavy and light chains and no mutations in the D and J regions. The purified soluble m390 Fab bound to SARS CoV RBD with an EC50 of about 50 nM while no binding to an irrelevant antigen gp120Bal was observed suggesting the specificity of the binding (Fig. 4B). Previously, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) specific antibodies with VHQ52/V\u03ba19\u201328 gene combination elicited in a mouse model were found devoid of somatic mutations but showed high binding avidities [23].

However, considerable specific enrichments were seen after panning against the SARS CoV RBD and Hendra virus sG, yielding an antibody against the RBD whose sequence is close to its parent germline. As we used the whole Envs in this study, one would expect the binding activity due to highly immunogenic epitopes such as the V3 loop which actually could bind and initiate immune response though it may be capable of diverting immune responses from the conserved epitopes. Therefore, the fact that there is no relatively high affinity binding of Envs might indicate that immune responses may not be so fast or in general are different than in the case of the other viruses. These results provide further evidence supporting and expanding the hypothesis that HIV-1 uses a strategy based on absent or weak binding of its conserved epitopes to germline antibodies for escaping neutralizing immune responses.",
