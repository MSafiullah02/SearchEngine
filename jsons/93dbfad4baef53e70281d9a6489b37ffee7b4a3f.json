The 4 significant value of community pharmacies was further highlighted during the COVID-19 5 pandemic crisis. Objective: The assessment of community pharmacies preparedness for the 6 COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional interview survey of 1018 community 7 pharmacies working in four regions of Egypt (South, East, Centre, and North). Data collection 8 was conducted from 8-19 April 2020. Results: Availability of personal protective equipment 9 (PPE) and medication was better than alcohol (70% conc.). Home delivery services were 10 available in 49.1% of pharmacies. Infection control measures covering interactions between staff 11 were in place in up to 99.5% of pharmacies. Conversely, there was less frequent availability of 12 contactless payment (29.1%), hand sanitizers (62.1%) or masks (86.5%) for customer use, or a 13 separate area for patients with suspected COVID-19 (64%). Verbal customer education (90.4%) 14 was used preferably to written (81.3%). Despite high clinical knowledge and awareness (97.6%-15 99.2%), only 8.8% of pharmacists had reported suspected COVID-19 cases, however this varied 16 significantly with pharmacist demographics (geographic region P<0.001; pandemic training 17 p<0.001; position p=0.019; age p=0.046). Conclusions: Government and policymakers strive to 18 mitigate the shortage of PPE and medication. More attention should be given to infection control 19 measures around interactions between staff and customers to ensure community pharmacists are 20 fit and able to provide continuity in their important role. Educating customers using regularly-21 updated posters, banners or signs will contribute to decreasing contact with patients, and 22 reducing the number and duration of visits to the pharmacy. Pandemic preparedness of 23 community pharmacists must also extend to reporting procedures. By avoiding under-reporting 24 or over-reporting, community pharmacists will contribute to accurate monitoring of the national 25 spread of infection.",

COVID-19 first appeared in Egypt in the first week of It is challenging for healthcare authorities to publishing accurate figures, reflecting actual totals, and in real time. The reasons for this may well be linked to limited testing capacity and difficulties in identifying the cause of death. a 14-day quarantine period was implemented and other preventative measures such as a partial curfew; with the Government of Egypt announcing an extension of the nationwide curfew for two further weeks, until April 23 rd 2020. 5 The curfew covered the hours between 6:00 pm and 6:00 am. All commercial enterprises and shops were prevented from working after 6:00 pm except food outlets and pharmacies. From April 24 th to May 23 rd (during Ramadan) The Presidency of the Council of Egyptian Ministers relaxed some of these preventative measures such as reducing the curfew by 3 hours (such that it covered 9:00 pm to 6:00 am) and allowed some businesses and government services offices to reopen in order to stimulate the economy and facilitate cultural/social practices during Ramadan.",

Further, in most LMICs, private pharmacies are broadly established 9 and provide the initial point and preferred channel through which members of the community are able to obtain medications and healthcare services for the majority of the population in developing countries, [10] [11] [12] including Egypt, as only 23 of 60,000 pharmacies are government owned. 13 The important value of private pharmacies was further highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis.

As at January 2020, half the world's face masks were produced in China 28 , but exports decreased as the infection spread and China's usage increased. Following the peak of the pandemic passing in China, the export of face masks increased again. 28 In surveyed pharmacies, necessary products such as hygiene products, antipyretic drugs, cold fomentations or ice packs and PPE (Table 2) were not available at all pharmacies, especially high concentration alcohol. Although community pharmacies strive to continue functioning as a business, it becomes necessary to prioritize maintaining adequate stock of the essential items according to local customer demand. Further, modification of package sizing and imposing customer limits on purchase quantities may be necessary, for example dividing large packets of Paracetamol into smaller ones and limiting the number sold to each customer to meet unprecedented demand. 29, 30 Recent researches suggest Chloroquine and its derivatives to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. 31-36 The present study found such quinine-based antimalarial drugs only to be available in 39.1% of pharmacies, a direct result of panic buying in response to the pandemic.

Efficient planning is required to ensure that prescriptions are collected while minimizing contact, 48 including provision for general practitioners to send paper prescriptions directly to pharmacies. 49 Interactions around payments can also be implemented, including the widespread use of contactless payment where possible. Unfortunately, card payment machines were only available 29.1% of the pharmacies surveyed.

Further, transmission rates, incidence and death rates may genuinely differ on a regional basis. There may be \"hot spots\" and also areas of extremely low transmission due to highly efficacious community mitigation efforts which are not reflected in this scale of analysis. 55",

With a significant increase in demand for the supply of information and medicines, community pharmacies will continue to serve local communities, unlike many other services and businesses. As a result, community pharmacies preparedness for this role is crucial. There are global shortages of PPE and medicines. As a result, governments and policymakers are doing all they can to address this shortage. Community pharmacists are exposed to high infection risks, and are especially vulnerable due to frequent contact with patients. Accordingly, infection control measures should be considered during all staff interactions with each other (maintaining workplace hygiene and waste management) and with customers (maintaining physical distance, taking care handling prescriptions, use of contactless payment methods, and providing suspected COVID-19 patients with their own definite area and free masks and hand sanitizers). It is paramount to ensure the health and safety of frontline pharmacists amongst other healthcare professionals to ensure continuity and functionally of their roles in the community. Educating customers, especially those at high risk, is essential during a pandemic. Posters, banners or signs must include regularly updated information so as to decrease patient contact and reduce crowding in-store. Pharmacists' own awareness and up-to-date knowledge are also essential. Accordingly, pandemic preparedness of pharmacists must not be overlooked, and should be extended to knowledge of accurate reporting procedures. Avoidance of under-reporting and over-reporting is important in order that pharmacists' reports of suspected infected cases contribute constructively to national reports of the spread of infection.

This included increasing the frequency of regular cleaning of clinical areas, and paying extra attention to areas known to be implicated in spreading disease (counter tops, door handles, pens, etc.). Planning is required in the implementation of these measures for the protection of patients/customers and staff. 39 By way of an example, the National Health Service in England advised community pharmacy staff to order small quantities of gloves, aprons and fluid-repellent face masks for use by staff and not to be sold to the public. 40 Unfortunately, the disposal of used PPE and other waste management was only considered in 80.4% of the pharmacies surveyed. Adequate provision of waste bins is a necessity. Any waste likely to carry COVID-19 must be double-bagged and/or separated from general waste for 72 hours disposal 41 to decrease the risk of transmission outside the pharmacy.",
