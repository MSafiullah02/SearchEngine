            "text": "outbreak and resulting pandemic, there has been a growing necessity to determine novel ways of safely evaluating patients who are suspected to be infected with the virus. Given the limited supply, cost, and often slow turnaround time of available assays, testing every patient who presents with symptoms or with recent exposure is currently not a viable option. It has been cited that early computed tomography scanning of patients may be beneficial, because infected patients may demonstrate radiologic findings before the onset of severe clinical symptoms. 1 However, the American College of Radiology recommends that computed tomography not be used to screen for or diagnose COVID-19 and that it be used sparingly in hospitalized, symptomatic patients given the risk of infection transmission posed to staff and subsequent patients. 2 There is evidence that lung point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) may be comparable to chest radiography and to computed tomography in terms of its ability to detect parenchymal and pleural pathology and to monitor response to therapies. 3 Historically, ultrasound was found to be an important tool for the rapid evaluation and assessment of pulmonary status in patients during the 2013 avian influenza A (H7N9) epidemic. 4, 5 Similarly, lung ultrasound may aid in the identification and subsequent monitoring of suspected COVID-19 infections, perhaps even before the onset or progression of respiratory symptoms. Here, we review the ultrasound findings reported from a number of studies and case reports 1,6-8 and discuss the unifying findings from COVID-19 patients and from the avian (H7N9) and H1N1 influenza epidemics. We also discuss the potential role for portable POCUS as a safe and effective bedside option in the initial evaluation, management, and monitoring of disease progression in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection.",

During the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, in which patients' conditions rapidly deteriorated from self-limited febrile illness to an aggressive pneumonia, chest radiographs often failed to identify early interstitial lung disease. 11 A cross-sectional study demonstrated abnormal ultrasound patterns showing interstitial syndrome in 15 of 16 patients who presented with normal chest radiographs, 63% of whom were subsequently diagnosed with viral (H1N1) pneumonia and 38% of whom were diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia. 9 Overall, lung ultrasound was found to have 94% sensitivity and 89% specificity or a positive predictive value of 86% and a negative predictive value of 96% and outperformed chest radiography for the detection of viral pneumonia in symptomatic patients. 5 The avian influenza A (H7N9) epidemics of 2013-2014 and 2016 saw large regional infection in China with a documented 1222 infections and a death rate of 40%. 12 Serial lung ultrasounds of these patients demonstrated the effectiveness of POCUS in the early identification of pneumonia secondary to the H7N9 virus. 4, 5 In both patients who eventually developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) as a result of the infection, serial lung ultrasound examinations showed B lines, pleural effusions, and small subpleural consolidations. These findings are consistent with previously documented findings in viral pulmonary infections such as measles and H1N1. 4, 5 Thus, ultrasonography has repeatedly proven to be an effective imaging modality to aid in both diagnosing and monitoring the progression of viral pneumonias. Its safety, in terms of lack of radiation exposure and relative ease of equipment sterilization to reduce the spread of infection, and accessibility to resourcelimited settings make it an ideal choice during epidemics. Computed tomography, while reliable in providing good diagnostic quality imaging, is costly and carries the disadvantages of radiation exposure, lack of portability, and heightened risk of infectious spread. 4,5",

For example, detection of a new consolidation with dynamic air bronchograms may suggest the development of a superimposed bacterial pneumonia. In addition to other clinical parameters, such ultrasound findings would support a decision to initiate antibiotics. 15 Consolidations that are more posterior may advocate for early prone positioning in the appropriate clinical context. Similarly, increasing B lines suggests a trend toward deterioration in a patient who may benefit from titration of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to improve aeration. Atelectasis on lung ultrasound may suggest the need for additional PEEP and recruitment maneuvers. Although less common in viral pneumonia, the size, location, and appearance of any pleural effusions can be assessed by lung ultrasound to determine the need for drainage.",

Examinations should be performed in a standardized manner, such as by using a 12-or 14-zone method to cover all lung areas and incorporating a scoring system, as proposed by Soldati et al, 16 to assist in the classification of findings. In this way, ultrasound can help predict responders and nonresponders to interventions, such as prone positioning and ventilation changes. 17, 18 Reduction in B lines, the reappearance of A lines, and the resolution of consolidations suggest recovery and would support a decision to wean respiratory support. Although beyond the scope of this article, it is important to note that cardiac ultrasound can also play a major role in optimizing the management of COVID-19 patients who may develop postviral cardiomyopathy 19 and who may have weaning failure that is of cardiovascular origin. 20 ",
