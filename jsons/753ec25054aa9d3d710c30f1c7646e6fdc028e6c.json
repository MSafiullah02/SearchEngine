Operational resilience is conceptualized as a multi-dimensional construct, consisting of two theoretically distinct components (i.e., disruption absorption and recoverability), which are argued to have unique effects on operational efficiency under varying operational disruption conditions. The study's hypotheses are empirically tested on primary data from a sample of 259 firms in a sub-Saharan African economy. Using structural equation modeling as an analytical tool, the study finds that both disruption absorption and recoverability have positive effects on operational efficiency. Additionally, the study finds that while the effect of disruption absorption on operational efficiency is stronger under conditions of high operational disruption, the effect of recoverability on operational efficiency is stronger under conditions of low operational disruption. A major implication of these findings is that the nature of operational resilience and the disruption circumstances under which it is deployed shape its efficiency value, thus advancing knowledge on the nuances associated with how and when operational resilience influences operational efficiency.",

Evidence shows that disruption to operations has direct and immediate negative consequences on operations systems and efficiency (Haraguchi and Lall, 2015) . For example, Japanese automobile companies such as Honda, Toyota, and Nissan had their key operations systems shut down for several days as a result of the 2011 floods in Thailand, significantly raising the companies' operational costs (Haraguchi and Lall, 2015) . Additionally, the 2019 fire outbreak in Australia disrupted major supply chains, operations and earnings, causing several million-dollar worth of losses to businesses and industries (Edwards, 2020) . While Qantas Airways has its shares dropped to a two-month low due to several flight cancellations, retailers in Australia experienced a significant drop in shopping traffic. Furthermore, a New York Times report indicates that Hyundai suspended its production in South Korea, and Tesla, Ford, and Nissan shut down their factories in China in February 2020 following supply chain disruptions linked to the outbreak of the coronavirus disease in China (Victor et al., 2020) . Apple's announcement of a drop in demand for Apple products within China as a result of the disruption caused by the coronavirus outbreak led to a 2.6% drop in the company's shares and wiping out US$34 billion in its market value (Horowitz, 2020) . Thus, the potency of disruptive events to cause deleterious impacts on operations systems makes resilience-building a top priority for business executives (Business Continuity Institute, 2019).",

While research interest in resilience is growing (e.g., Pettit et al., 2019; Ivanov et al., 2017) , knowledge of the operational resilience construct is limited in two important ways. First, besides the recognition that the resilience construct is not completely understood (Manhart et al., 2020; Pettit et al., 2019) , previous research is limited to the study of the construct at supply chain network and firm levels. This leaves the field with limited knowledge of the nature of the resilience construct at the operations level of the firm. Yet, understanding the nature and consequences of resilience at the operations level is important in that operations is a unique subsystem of the firm and constitutes a primary value-creation function that generates earnings for firms and their supply chain partners. Besides, in the event of a disruption, operations is the system that is immediately impacted.",

Subsequently, Wong et al. (2019) investigate the complexities associated with these variables by linking resilience to financial performance.

            "text": "Against this backdrop, this study examines the following research questions: what is the conceptual domain of operational resilience?; how does operational resilience relate to operational efficiency?; and how does operational disruption condition the effect of operational resilience on operational efficiency? This study addresses the first research question by following an output-base theoretical approach and insights from other relevant literature to propose the notion of operational resilience, which is defined as the ability of a firm's operations to absorb and recover from disruptions (van der Vegt et al., 2015; Meyer, 1982) . Thus, the study proposes a two-dimensional conceptualization of operational resilience, with components consisting of disruption absorption and recoverability. Disruption absorption refers to the ability of a firm to maintain the structure and normal functioning of operations in the face of disruptions. Recoverability refers to the ability of a firm to restore operations to a prior normal level of performance after being disrupted. Regarding the second and third research questions, the study extends resource-based theory to contingency perspective of the firm to generate new insights into how the components of operational resilience uniquely influence operational efficiency under low and high operational disruption conditions. This paper makes three contributions to the resilience literature. First, we theoretically specify the operational resilience construct from an output-base perspective and shed light on how such an approach to resilience conceptualization help clarify the ambiguity in the existing resilience literature. The proposed conceptualization of operational resilience in this study is useful for research and practice in that it detaches the conceptual drivers of the construct from its core components (Hosseini et al., 2019; Scholten et al., 2019) , affording a fine-grained theorization and appraisal of the performance consequences of operational resilience at its component level (Manhart et al., 2020) . Second, this study extends previous research on resilience-efficiency linkage (e. g., Wong et al., 2019; Yu et al., 2019) by explicitly linking each component of operational resilience to operational efficiency to uncover their unique performance values. Third, in further advancing the work of Wong et al. (2019) , we examine and test the unique effects of the components of operational resilience on operational efficiency at varying conditions of operational disruption. To this end, the study shows how changing disruption intensity situations shapes conclusions about the relationship between resilience and efficiency.",

Following the OBR perspective, several empirical studies (e.g., Yu et al., 2019; Buyl et al., 2017; Brandon-Jones et al., 2014) argue that IBR elements do not capture the notion of resilience in that they cannot fully account for the variances in OBR elements. That said, it is argued that IBR elements do not in themselves reflect the core conceptual domain of resilience (Davidson et al., 2016) : at best, they are indicative of \"formative resilience elements\" (Scholten et al., 2019) , \"resilience-enhancers\" (Blackhurst et al., 2011) or \"drivers of resilience\" (Hosseini et al., 2019) .",

First, while we agree that IBR elements are essential drivers of OBR elements, it is challenging to assume that variation in IBR elements necessarily implies variability in resilience. The formative nature of IBR elements suggests that for any given OBR element, a non-exhaustive list of IBR elements is required; something that appears practically impossible (Cadogan and Lee, 2016) . Second, IBR elements may have to be bundled, configured, and leveraged to fully explain their viability to vary OBR elements (Jain et al., 2017; Brandon-Jones et al., 2014) . These arguments highlight the problem of using IBR elements to make conclusions about the nature of resilience. Unlike IBR elements, OBR elements are defined and measured with respect to disruptions (see e.g., Wong et al., 2019; Yu et al., 2019; Buyl et al., 2017) , allowing for effective appraisal of the strategic and operational value of resilience. Taken together, the OBR perspective allows analysis of resilience as a distinct concept that is separate from its antecedents and consequences.",

The disruption profile framework suggests that resilience of operations to disruptions can be ascertained by knowing the normal operating performance level prior to occurrence of a disruption. Subsequent to this prior information on the occurrence of a disruption, operational resilience can be determined by 1) calculating the magnitude of the drop in normal operating performance level immediately after the occurrence of a disruptive event and just before a recovery action is initiated, and 2) calculating the time it takes for a firm to restore operations to normal performance level after recovery action is initiated (Li et al., 2019; DesJardine et al., 2017; Buyl et al., 2017) . A greater drop in normal performance level suggests that the operations lacks disruption absorption capability, and a smaller drop in normal operations implies the operations possess a disruption absorption capability (Blackhurst et al., 2011; Sheffi and Rice, 2005) . Operations with high disruption absorption can accommodate disruptions or persist in the face of disruptions (Buyl et al., 2017; DesJardine et al., 2017) . The Li and Fung company's ability to continue serving its customers when its competitors halted their operations during the 1997 Indonesian currency crisis provides a case study to demonstrate this aspect of operational resilience (Tang, 2006) .",

In line with the disruption profile framework, we contend that it may be difficult for a firm to activate both components of operational resilience simultaneously in that disruption absorption would logically and practically precede disruption recovery actions. After all, occurrence of disruption events would justify the need for recovery action to be activated. High disruption absorption coupled with low impact disruptions may not cause normal operating performance levels to fall below specified critical threshold level that may necessitate activation of recoverability. In essence, possession of disruption absorption does not prevent a firm from possessing recoverability, and vice versa. Additionally, the fact that a firm has disruption absorption does not necessarily imply that the firm has recoverability (Behzadi et al., 2017) . As Holling (1973) asserts, a system can be 'resilient' (i.e., persist in the face of disruptions) and yet lack 'stability' (i.e. the ability to return to an equilibrium state after being exposed to a disruption), and vice versa.",

To this end, we make a significant extension to the resource-based perspective of resilience by explicating the valuable, rare, inimitable, and non-substitutable (VRIN) resource nature of OBR elements. Disruption absorption and recoverability qualify as VRIN resources and thus may generate sustained competitive advantage and performance. Both capabilities are valuable as they allow firms to neutralize the negative impacts of disruptions (e.g., inefficiencies, poor delivery performance, lost sales, and bad reputation). In addition, the two capabilities are rare in that they are pathdependent, idiosyncratic in nature (DesJardine et al., 2017), and are not readily available on the market for purchase. That is, complex IBR antecedent elements may drive the disruption absorption and recoverability capabilities (Brandon-Jones et al., 2014; Blackhurst et al., 2011) , making them idiosyncratic, difficult to imitate, trade, and transferred (Barney, 1991) . Furthermore, their unique intended purposes and roles in disruption management make them non-substitutable (Behzadi et al., 2017) . Accordingly, all things being equal, we expect firms with high disruption absorption and recoverability to be more effective in managing disruptions (Kwak et al., 2018; Brandon-Jones et al., 2014) .",

For example, unexpected power cuts, machine and technology breakdowns, supplier failure, raw material shortage, or restriction to movement of people and goods due to an outbreak of a pandemic (such as the coronavirus) can lead to delays in processes, increase in idle time, and underutilization of other resources. Additional overheads may accrue for fixing breakdowns in operations. For instance, in order not to disappoint and lose customers, some firms may go to the extent of incurring back-order costs, which may negatively impact on firms' operational efficiency levels. In events of disruptions, firms with high disruption absorption capability are better able to maintain the structure and functioning of operations within critical thresholds (Brandon-Jones et al., 2014) , allowing them to preserve normal operating performance levels, and accordingly avoiding inefficiency associated with disruptions. Alternatively, firms with high recoverability are more effective at restoring operations quickly following disruptions (Brandon-Jones et al., 2014) , which helps minimize the chances of recording escalated levels of inefficiency.",

Therefore, it is likely that efficiency gains associated with increasing operational resilience may be canceled by associated costs. Notwithstanding these alternative arguments, empirical evidence shows that greater levels of disruption absorption and recoverability generate an enhanced competitive advantage (Kwak et al., 2018) and financial performance (Wong et al., 2019; Yu et al., 2019) .

For Pettit et al. (2019) , resilience-building should be a balancing act involving matching investment in resilience-enhancing capabilities relative to exposure to disruption impacts. When the risk of disruption is low, increasing resilience can erode profit (Pettit et al., 2010) . On the contrary, high levels of risk of disruption coupled with low investment in resilience increase a firm's level of vulnerability. While these insights suggest that it may be justifiable for firms experiencing greater levels of operational disruption to increase operational resilience, knowledge of whether under such a situation, the operational efficiency benefits of disruption absorption and recoverability amplify or weaken is underexplored.",

Under such a condition, the need for certainty and operational stability may increase, resulting in a greater emphasis on resilience-building strategies Bode et al., 2011) , which can both increase and decrease operational efficiency level. In particular, greater emphasis on resilience as a result of high operational disruption may result in greater investment in resilience-building strategies, which can increase costs of managing disruptions . Alternatively, conditions of high operational disruption may suggest vulnerability and create heightened situational awareness of disruption, which can induce firms to become more effective in detecting and avoiding disruptions, helping minimize disruption impacts and costs. The potential efficiency-value of operational resilience is realized when firms face disruptions. Therefore, in a low operational disruption situation, it can be counterproductive, efficiency wise, to increase operational resilience. Inefficiencies associated with maintaining high levels of operational resilience in a low operational disruption condition can, therefore, erode the associated efficiency benefits of resilience (Wong et al., 2019; Pettit et al., 2010) . Accordingly, we hypothesize that:",

We draw on the relevant resilience literature (e.g., Buyl et al., 2017; DesJardine et al., 2017) to use an OBR perspective to specify and empirically test a two-dimensional conceptualization of the operational resilience construct, comprising disruption absorption and recoverability capabilities. Our conceptualization of resilience from an OBR perspective offers important value for future empirical research on resilience. This perspective enables researchers to assess a system's resilience level following exposure to a disruptive event. This approach affords researchers opportunity to analyze the extent to which a system survives disruptions and the kind of response actions deployed to manage disruptions. This way, one can better theorize and gauge both the underlying drivers and performance consequences of a system's response capabilities (Manhart et al., 2020) . We argue that since IBR elements may not guarantee the integrity and normal functioning of a system when a disruption occurs, analyzing the performance effects of resilience from the IBR perspective may mask important insights. In view of these, it can profit the progress of resilience research if future studies treat IBR elements as antecedents to OBR elements (Scholten et al., 2019; Brandon-Jones et al., 2014) and then link the latter to performance (Yu et al., 2019; Wong et al., 2019) .",

These additional findings further enhance knowledge on performance benefits of resilience: while Wong et al. (2019) finds no support for the effect of resilience on financial performance under changing magnitudes of disruptions, findings from this study suggest that under a high operational disruption situation, the components of operational resilience do not yield the same efficiency gains. Disruption absorption, unlike recoverability, is largely built at the pre-disruption stage and involves more resource investment in buffers. Thus, when operational disruption is low, increasing levels of disruption absorption can generate lower efficiency gains. On the other hand, the efficiency benefit of recoverability can be greater in a low operational disruption condition as under such a situation, there may be little additional costs (e.g., overtime expenses) for restoring operations. Findings relating to H2 and H3a-b show that analyzing the effects of resilience at its disaggregated scale and considering varying conditions of operational disruption may shed important lights on when operational resilience is more or less beneficial for operational efficiency. This study shows that the efficiency benefit of operational resilience is contingent on its elements and under conditions of low and high operational disruption.",

Firstly, consistent with extant literature (Scholten and Schilder, 2015) , results indicate that collaborative resilience-building effort plays a significant role in driving disruption absorption. Further result, however, indicates that collaborative resilience-building effort does not directly influence operational efficiency. Results further indicate that firm age, firm industry, and slack resource may play trivial roles in explaining disruption absorption, recoverability, and operational efficiency. The non-significant finding relating to the slack resource-operational resilience link is quite intriguing. It must be noted that the slack resource scale in this study captures non-absorbed slack. Thus, one possible explanation for this finding is that non-absorbed slack resource may benefit disruption absorption and recoverability when it is deployed in the implementation of resilience-building strategies, something that this research does not capture. Thus, results from our research cannot be used to settle the debate on whether slack resource is a fundamental characteristic of resilient organizations (Vogus and Sutcliffe, 2007) . Again, this study's results show that firm size-advantage is critical for fostering disruption absorption and recoverability (Pal et al., 2014) . Besides, results suggest that while size-advantage is negatively related to operational efficiency, this effect is mitigated by the role of size-advantage in increasing disruption absorption and recoverability. In addition, results suggest that disruption orientation may benefit recoverability more than disruption absorption and that its contribution to these capabilities become more salient in firms operating in high operational disruption setting. These findings crystalize Yu et al.'s (2019) findings and provide clarity on the argument that the disruption orientation-resilience link may be contingent upon operational disruption. Finally, consistent with Yu et al.'s (2019) findings, results indicate that disruption orientation is not directly related to operational efficiency.",

Insights from this research encourage managers to assess operational resilience from the OBR perspective as the IBR elements are essential but insufficient for surviving disruptions. Assuming IBR elements (e.g., slack resource, visibility, agility, flexibility, collaboration, and information sharing) constitute the conceptual domain of resilience could lead to overconfidence, and accordingly obscure opportunities that can be exploited to rapidly absorb and recover from disruptive events.",

Thus, a key message for managers is that they should not view these capabilities as substitutes, but rather as complements. While disruption absorption permits operations to function normally during disruption events without major absorption changes to the constituents and configuration of operations system, recoverability ensures that operations output rates bounce back to prior normal levels following disruption; making both types of capabilities crucial in managing disruptive events.",

However, the nature of disruption absorption suggests that increasing its threshold would require managers to focus greater attention on pre-disruption stage measures, particularly, buffering strategies, as these allow managers to hedge operations system from disruption impacts. On the other hand, swiftness in searching and seizing opportunities to respond to disruptions would be an instrumental lever for boosting recoverability following disruptive events.",

Additionally, debates about whether resilience is good or bad cannot be limited to its effects on efficiency (as it is the case of this study) or financial performance (as captured in previous studies). Survival and stability goals (Bode et al., 2011) rather than efficiency and profitability goals may be alternative motivation and justification for businesses to increase investments in resilience building.
