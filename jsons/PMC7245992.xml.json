For COVID-19 patients to be placed on ventilators and to be maintained in the state of ventilation, several injectable drugs, such as propofol, midazolam, lorazepam, fentanyl, norepinephrine, succinylcholine, hydromorphone, and morphine, are needed. These drugs are in short supply and have been for quite some time (5). These shortages call into question the current antiquated global drug supply system based on cost alone. To be a part of the solution, the NIPTE has engaged with the US FDA and other federal entities to discuss and evolve its proposal to establishing a platform for the rapid pharmaceutical manufacturing of injectable drugs in the USA, starting from building blocks readily available from the US chemical industry.",

The gap in innovation is, to no small extent, a result of moving pharmaceutical manufacturing offshore and basing competitive advantage on cheaper labor rather than developing and adopting advanced technologies. The lack of substantial drug manufacturing in the USA leads to diminished attention to its problems and needs. Symptomatically, a large multibillion-dollar public-private partnership network, Manufacturing USA, which spans from textile to artificial intelligence, does not include drug manufacturing, except its bio sector. At the same time, the public debate and governmental policies impose immense cost pressure on drug manufacturers. For example, the Generic Drug User Fee Act (GDUFA) and the FDA Drug Competition Action Plan (DCAP) are explicitly designed to address \u201cmarket failure\u201d by facilitating increased market competition. However, these efforts tend to push the industry to focus on cost-cutting measures such as moving production to low-cost locations while still using the traditional approach to manufacturing because of regulatory concerns.",

Instead of seeking low-cost labor, the industry\u2019s needs can be better served by a highly skilled and highly productive workforce capable of operating advanced manufacturing lines. The US FDA has placed its attention on continuous manufacturing because of its higher reliability and efficiency to manufacture drugs than the traditional labor-intensive, multi-step batch process. On February 26, 2019, the FDA issued draft guidance entitled \u201cQuality Considerations for Continuous Manufacturing\u201d (6) to provide greater regulatory predictability and encouragement for the industry. This approach will offer significant additional savings by cutting long supply chains that are complex and difficult to manage. It will provide other advantages by being geographically closer to consumers and thus reducing shipping costs and carbon footprint. Most importantly, it will utilize the local labor force, instill confidence in the products made in America, and ultimately change the perception of the pharmaceutical industry in the eyes of the American public. To facilitate reshoring the supply chain utilizing new technologies, it is essential to engage academic science and engineering centers and create new ones that specifically focus on the design and development of materials and products and continuous manufacturing processes.",

The US FDA attempts to reinforce confidence in generics by blanket public statements that generic drugs are as safe and effective as brand name drugs.

The proposed Pharmaceutical Quality Assurance Index seeks to inform the consumer and contribute to improving the value of quality and its assurance. The Index is intended to provide a mechanism that would allow the consumers, actual buyers of drug products, such as insurers, governments, group purchasing organizations, and distributors, to make informed decisions based on the quality of drug products. Informed consumer and payor decision-making can also incentivize the industry to improve drug quality and minimize negative media coverage of their regulatory violations and external quality failures.

In recent decades, the shift in demand due to globalization of the pharmaceutical supply chain, as well as insufficient research funding opportunities, caused significant reductions in relevant educational programs in US universities. That has to change, and colleges of pharmacy and chemical and pharmaceutical engineering have the opportunity to take the lead. This opportunity can present new growth of colleges of pharmacy that have lately experienced significant drops in applications for professional pharmacy practice programs. Furthermore, enrollment of international students in graduate programs is likely to decline due to the pandemic. To adequately meet the reshoring demand, focus on offering pharmaceutical science and engineering education opportunities for the US students, and current professionals are needed. A range of educational programs, a certificate to bachelor\u2019s, master\u2019s, and doctoral degrees, with emphasis on industrial and regulatory practice, is needed. The curricula for these educational offerings should be updated to ensure traditional pharmaceutical science disciplines integrate with contemporary pharmaceutical material science, product, and process design and engineering and biotechnology in the context of regulatory approval and inspection requirements. The NIPTE is already playing a significant role in establishing similar programs; for example, it has developed a Certification in Pharmaceutical Science and Technology, and it is currently available to industrial scientists and FDA review staff. Education, training, and experiences are foundational requirements under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (for example, 21 CFR 211.15) and critical to ensuring a science-based approach to the design, development, and manufacturing of quality drugs.",
