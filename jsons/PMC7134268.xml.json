Since the early 2000s when the dot com period hit its peak, the research interest has centered on the opportunities, challenges and implications that novel digital technologies introduce. The proliferation of such technologies, coupled with the rapid adoption of computer-based systems and the investments in network infrastructures, created a new wave of opportunities on digitalized processes [1, 22]. Along this progression, research has focused on issues related to each transition, examining obstacles of adoption from the individual to the industry level, value generating mechanisms, and the anticipated and unanticipated effects of integrating these technologies in everyday life.",

Doing so will allow researchers to understand the evolution of the field over the past two decades and identify the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. The most appropriate way to examine all publications presented in the conferences throughout these years is by applying a methodology that quantifies the core topics, the marginal contributions, the under-developed themes, and the forthcoming ideas that worth investing on, as well as how these topics are related and move between these states during the last 18 years. The main objective of this work is to capture, interpret and understand the big picture in the I3E domain from a quantified viewpoint. The research presented in this paper is a mapping study of the I3E field; it is a review that seeks to identify, not results, but linkages, shows the internal dynamics and structure of the domain, and pinpoints the topics with impact in the given discipline.",

Co-word analysis allows for and supports the identification of key patterns and trends that point to particular changes in research topics (e.g., emerging or declining interests) or specific research directions (e.g., paradigm shifts), using a graph of key-terms [11], extracted directly from the metadata of the papers. Considering this, the present study maps the intellectual progress of the e-Business, e-Services and e-Society landscape, as reflected in the records of I3E conferences. The proceedings of this event provide a solid foundation to the related work published to date. During the past 18 years, considerable work has been published, allowing us to observe where the field currently stands, what are the challenges and opportunities the researchers are facing, and what are the potential driving forces in the near future. Accordingly, this work mainly contributes as follows:brings new insights on the intellectual mapping and progress of the area of I3E;raises awareness of the community on the mature, under-developed, emerging, or declining research themes;highlights individual topics as popular, core or backbone topics within the discipline.\n",

The findings demonstrate the role of blockchain as a facilitator of instant payments, trusted interfaces and traceability of goods for the consumers. Specifically, businesses can be benefited from blockchain in terms of machine-to-machine transactions, accounting, business process management and provenance traceability. New business opportunities also arise in government sector such as digital storage, authentication and maintenance of records, smart trust codification and new market for digital payment services and global commerce [9].",

Overall, 835 peer-reviewed papers were produced within the community of I3E and published to-date. The keynote speeches, prefaces to the conference-, or track proceedings, as well as the papers that did not contain any keywords, were excluded from the analysis. From the collected papers, the author-assigned keywords were extracted from the metadata of each paper and were used as a unit of analysis. The keywords used for the description of the content of a publication can be seen as the basic building blocks of the structure of a research field; an article\u2019s keywords provide an adequate summary of its content, and thus can be utilized to reduce a large space of descriptors (i.e., article text) to a network graph of smaller related spaces (i.e., keywords) [6]. Although when authors choose keywords to describe their work those keywords can either be very generic or very specific, still, those keywords are human annotations on the content of the papers, reflecting human judgement and perspective. The idea is to understand the conceptual structure and evolution of a field directly from the interaction between keywords: if two keywords co-occur within a paper, then the two topics they represent are related; higher co-word frequency implies stronger correlation in keywords pairs, further suggesting that two keywords are related to a specific theme [6]. The 835 papers are distributed per year of publication as shown in Fig. 1.\n",

Due to this heavy-tailedness, the research landscape of I3E is a scale-free network, with small number of popular terms acting as \u201chubs\u201d: they connect different topics, capture major research directions and influences in the field, and shape its intellectual structure [11]. A scale-free network also suggests that major research themes can be detected with small subset of popular terms. A previous analysis in the HCI research field demonstrated that less than 100 keywords are enough to describe the intellectual progress of a field [17]. Thus, in the present study we decided to include only those keywords that appear more than four times (n \u2265 4) in the period 2001\u20132019. This decision was grounded on two facets: (a) the frequency of a term reflects its significance for a research community, i.e., the higher the frequency is, the more often the term attracts the researchers\u2019 attention/interest; and (b) the retained 65 keywords (total frequency = 646, 37.3% of the total unique keywords) cover 461 (86.8%) of the 531 articles (with keywords) published. Furthermore, for the given datasets of terms and papers, n = 4 is the minimum term frequency that achieves the highest inclusion of papers in the datasets. For example, for author-assigned keywords with n \u2265 3, the retained keywords are N = 150 and cover 88.9% of the papers, whereas for keywords with n \u2265 5, N = 57 keywords, covering 72.3% of the papers. Thus, with fewer yet highly frequent terms we could satisfactorily describe the I3E network of terms.",

The idea behind co-word analysis rests on the assumption that key-terms identified within an article (e.g., keywords) can adequately describe and communicate the content of that article; the co-occurrence of at-least two keywords in the same article indicates a linkage between the topics, i.e., a \u201ctheme\u201d [4].

Graphs consist of nodes that represent the keywords, and links that represent the interactions between the nodes. Given a network of keywords, a combination of clustering, network analysis and strategic diagrams is used to model the conceptual structure of a field and to characterize it [4]. The graph theory concepts employed are centrality (i.e., the strength of the links from one research theme or cluster to others, indicating its significance in the development of the community [17]) and density (i.e., the coherence of a cluster and a measure of a theme\u2019s development [10]). Combining centrality and density allows for the creation of two-dimensional strategic diagrams [4] (Fig. 2): the position of a cluster in the diagram corresponds to the importance of the cluster in the whole network (i.e., centrality \u2013 x-axis) in relation to how well the theme of this cluster is developed (i.e., density \u2013y-axis).\n",

The supervised clustering method allows to maintain content validity and cluster fitness for the highest number of clusters [11, 17]. Each cluster represents a research theme or sub-field. The co-word network was further analyzed using the following measures:Keywords: set of terms that constitute a cluster;Size: number of keywords in the cluster;Frequency: how many times all keywords (in a cluster) appear in the dataset;Co-word frequency: how many times at-least two keywords (from a cluster) appear in the same paper. Computing this results in a symmetrical co-occurrence matrix [15]: values in the diagonal cells are term frequencies, and values in non-diagonal cells are co-word frequencies. High frequency of co-occurrence between terms indicates connection between the topics they represent;Transitivity: how tightly connected is the cluster (the clustering coefficient), i.e., how close the keywords are to being a \u201cclique\u201d. Transitivity is the frequency of loops of length three in the cluster; a loop of length three is a sequence of nodes x, y, z such that (x, y), (y, z) and (z, x) are edges of the graph [25]. The value range is [0, 1];Centrality: the degree of interaction of a theme with other parts of the network, i.e., how many other clusters a cluster connects to [4]; Centrality refers to a group of metrics that aim to quantify the \u201cimportance\u201d of a particular node (or cluster) within a network (e.g., betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, eigenvector centrality, degree centrality) [20]. Here we used betweenness centrality (C), with 0 \u2264 C \u2264 1;Density: how cohesive is the cluster of terms, i.e., the number of direct ties observed for the cluster divided by the maximum number of possible ones [4]. Density is graph-dependent and can be any positive real number [14].\n",

In addition, a keyword network graph was created from the keywords list. In this graph, each keyword is represented as a node, and the keywords that co-appear on a paper are linked together. By creating associations between keywords, multiple networks associated with different themes are also created. In this case, bridges are built between the nodes of keywords, to allow communication and information flow between isolated regions in the whole network. Those nodes are known as structural holes [21]. Keywords acting as structural holes serve as a \u201cbackbone\u201d of a network: if removed, the network will lose its cohesion and will disintegrate into separated and unconnected concepts. Thus, the network\u2019s core-periphery structure needs to be computed, to determine which nodes are part of a densely connected core (i.e., with a higher number of bridges), or a sparsely connected periphery [24]. Core nodes are reasonably well-connected to peripheral nodes, while peripheral nodes are sparingly connected to a core node or to each other. A node belongs to a core only if it is well-connected to other core nodes and to peripheral nodes [24]. A follow-up core-periphery analysis was performed to spot the core research topics from the perspective of the whole network. In this analysis, keywords were categorized according to their popularity, coreness (i.e., connectedness with other topics) and constraint (i.e., backbone). The whole approach is illustrated in Fig. 3.\n",

Those topics appear to have high-density, i.e., the clustering coefficient is high and the topics within each of the cluster are very well connected to each other, but they lack strong ties with topics that are external to them. The following-up core-periphery analysis will provide insight on that issue.",

Big data and business analytics ecosystems may pave the way towards digital transformation and sustainable societies [23]. Furthermore, the strong link between e-commerce and social media (Table 1), denotes the increased prevalence of social commerce efforts over the last years (e.g., [18]). We witness an increased number of social media platforms featuring commercial aspects, with some notable examples being Facebook and Instagram. As more vendors utilize these platforms, trust emerges as a core aspect [9], both regarding the sales side and the products featured on these, as well as on the data exchanged and utilized for marketing and sales promotions [8]. Recent events (e.g. the Cambridge Analytica scandal) surfaced issues about privacy violation and use of data by third-parties which have come to the attention of the general population. As social media and e-commerce vendors become increasingly more integrated, data sharing and ownership issues will be brought in the spotlight of research/practice.",
