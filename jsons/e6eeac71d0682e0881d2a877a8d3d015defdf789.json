            "text": "Viroporins are virus encoded proteins that alter membrane permeability and can trigger subsequent cellular signals. Oligomerization of viroporin subunits results in formation of a hydrophilic pore which facilitates ion transport across host cell membranes. These viral channel proteins may be involved in different stages of the virus infection cycle. Inflammasomes are large multimolecular complexes best recognized for their ability to control activation of caspase-1, which in turn regulates the maturation of interleukin-1 \u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and interleukin 18 (IL-18). IL-1\u03b2 was originally identified as a pro-inflammatory cytokine able to induce both local and systemic inflammation and a febrile reaction in response to infection or injury. Excessive production of IL-1\u03b2 is associated with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Microbial derivatives, bacterial pore-forming toxins, extracellular ATP and other pathogen-associated molecular patterns trigger activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes. Recent studies have reported that viroporin activity is capable of inducing inflammasome activity and production of IL-1\u03b2, where NLRP3 is shown to be regulated by fluxes of K + , H + and Ca 2+ in addition to reactive oxygen species, autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum stress. The aim of this review is to present an overview of the key findings on viroporin activity with special emphasis on their role in virus immunity and as possible activators of inflammasomes.",

These receptors sense specific molecules within the virus termed PAMPs (Pathogen associated molecular patterns) and then signal through various downstream messengers to activate transcription factors that drive the expression of antiviral genes and various cytokines, such as type I and III interferons and IL-1\u03b2 (Horner, 2014) . Production of these cytokines is essential for activation of the whole immune response against the viral infection. T ype I interferons induce expression of co-stimulatory molecules such as CD80, CD86 and CD40 leading to maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) as well as antigen presentation on MHC class I and cross presentation of viral antigens (Gessani et al., 2014) . These cytokines are also responsible for recruitment of monocytes and other lymphocytes to the site of infection, and they upregulate effector molecules in charge of protein synthesis, cell growth and survival and activation of anti-viral mode (Arango Duque and Descoteaux, 2014).",

To date, thirteen members of TLR family have been identified. TLRs belong among type I integral membrane glycoproteins, which comprise an extracellular domain containing different numbers of leucine-rich-repeat (LRR) motifs, a single transmembrane helix, and a cytoplasmic signaling domain homologous to that of the interleukin 1 receptor (IL-1R), called the Toll-interleukin 1 receptor (TIR) domain (Chang et al., 2007) . Based on their primary sequences, TLRs can be divided into several subfamilies, each of which recognizes related PAMPs: the subfamily of TLR1, TLR2, and TLR6 recognizes lipids, whereas the closely related TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 recognize nucleic acids (Celhar and Magalhaes, 2012) . TLR 2, 3, 4, 7, 8 and 9 have been shown to be involved in virus recognition depending on the type of the genetic material which the virus possesses: single stranded RNA (ssRNA) is recognized by TLR7 and TLR8, double stranded (ds) RNA is recognized by TLR3 and viral DNA is recognized by TLR9 (Akira et al., 2006) . After binding their ligands, TLRs dimerize and undergo conformational changes required for the recruitment of TIR-domain-containing adaptor molecules. Four downstream adaptor molecules are involved, resulting in differential response which are (1) Myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88), (2) Toll-interleukin 1 receptor (TIR) -associated protein (TIRAP)/MyD88-adaptor-like (MAL), (3) TIR-domain-containing adaptor protein-inducing IFN-\u03b2 (TRIF) /TIR-domain-containing molecule 1 (TICAM1) and (4) TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM) (Kawai and Akira, 2009) .",

RIG-I is a cytosolic dsRNA helicase that is encoded in humans by the DDX58 gene. It consists of two N-terminal CARDs (caspase activation and recruitment domains) followed by a central DExD/H box helicase and Cterminal regulatory domains (helicase-CTD) (Ferrage et al., 2012; Yoneyama et al., 2004) . Viral dsRNA is sensed by RIG-I via its helicase domain whereas the CARD domains are responsible for downstream signaling (Saito et al., 2007) . Upon binding of PAMPs to RIG-I, conformational changes are induced where the C-terminal repression is relieved, followed by binding to the viral RNA and scanning for particular U/UC sequences (Rehwinkel and Reis e Sousa, 2010) . Then RIG-I releases CARD domains for ubiquitination by TRIM25 and interaction with 14-3-3\u03b5 (a family of regulatory molecules that interact with several signaling proteins) to promote association with intracellular membranes for translocation to the mitochondrial-associated endoplasmic reticulum membrane (mitochondrial-associated membrane, MAM) to recruit a mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), termed RIG-I signaling adaptor protein (Yoneyama et al., 2004; Rehwinkel and Reis e Sousa, 2010) . This interaction will in turn activate effector molecules, including the transcription factors IRF3 and NF\u03baB, to drive downstream innate immune signaling (Saito et al., 2007; Yoneyama et al., 2004) .",

            "text": "The most recently identified pathway in the recognition of RNA viruses is governed by Nod (nucleotide oligomerization domain)-like receptors (NLRs) that recognize PAMPs, as well as host-derived danger associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) (Schroder and Tschopp, 2010) and cause subsequent activation of inflammasomes (Horvath et al., 2011) . Unlike TLRs, this family consists of soluble proteins that survey the cytoplasm for signals that advertise the presence of intracellular invaders (Martinon and Tschopp, 2005) . Structurally, NLRs are multidomain proteins with a tripartite architecture containing a C-terminal region characterized by a series of leucine-rich repeats (Bella et al., 2008) , a central nucleotide domain termed the NACHT domain (also referred to as NOD domain) (Kufer et al., 2005) , and an N-terminal caspase recruitment (CARD) or pyrin (PYD) domain (Johnson and Gale, 2006) . LRRs are believed to function in ligand sensing and autoregulation, whereas CARD and PYD domains mediate homotypic protein-protein interactions for downstream signaling. NLR subfamilies differ in their N-terminal effector domains, which mediate signal transduction to downstream targets, leading to activation of inflammatory caspases by inflammasomes or NF-\u03baB by NOD signalosomes (Johnson and Gale, 2006) . The NACHT domain, which is the only domain common to all NLR family members, enables activation of the signaling complex via ATP-dependent oligomerization (Kufer et al., 2005) .",

This new family of virus proteins that alter membrane permeability was named viroporins. Typically, viroporins are comprised of 50-120 amino acids and tend to form homo-oligomers (Scott and Griffin, 2015; Wang et al., 2011) . Oligomerization produces a hydrophilic pore which allows ion transport across host cell membranes. Activity of these viral ion channel proteins is involved in many stages of the virus infection cycle. Viroporins play important roles in virus genome replication and assembly, as well as virus particle entry and release from infected cells (Wozniak Table 1 Summary of viroporins and their proposed functions in the virus life cycle.

Some studies reported that the deletion of viroporin-encoding genes from virus genome significantly reduces the formation of virus progeny, and thus lowers virus pathogenicity. This highlights the essential role of viroporins in the viral life cycle, opening a new window for their potential use as antiviral targets (Nieva et al., 2012; Steinmann et al., 2007; Steinmann and Pietschmann, 2010) . The study of viroporins initially focused on M2 of the influenza A virus (IAV), picornavirus protein 2B (P2B) and togavirus protein 6 K, while only recently HIV-1 viral protein U (Vpu) and HCV p7 were included (Nieva et al., 2012) . A summary of viroporins and their roles in viral life cycle is provided in Table 1 . According to the number of transmembrane domains and their topology, viroporins are divided into two classes. Class I viroporins possess a single membrane-spanning domain. These viroporins contain proteins that are inserted into the membrane with either a luminal amino terminus and cytosolic carboxyl terminus (class IA) such as M2 of IAV, Vpu of HIV-1 and E protein of coronavirus, or a cytosolic amino terminus and lumenal carboxyl terminus (class IB) such as small hydrophobic protein of human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and P3A of polio virus.",

            "text": "Along the study of the nature of viroporins, the question has been raised of whether ion gated channels or small sized pores are formed and whether ions are redistributed according to their concentration gradient (OuYang et al., 2013; StGelais et al., 2009 ). Studies of transgenically expressed viroporins in cell cultures, planar lipid bilayer or liposomes have shown that each viroporin has its individual channel function, which determines how it would affect membrane permeability (Nieva et al., 2012) . For instance, the most characterized viroporin M2 was studied by patch-clamp recordings and proton conductance was demonstrated (Chizhmakov et al., 2003) . The channel was shown to conduct protons selectively across cellular membranes which causes loss of organelle acidification (Wang et al., 1994) . The same activity was confirmed by biochemical assays such as haemagglutinin protein translocation to the cell surface. which is a direct consequence of exposure to increasing pH in vesicles by M2 activity (Alvarado-Facundo et al., 2015; Ciampor et al., 1992; Griffin et al., 2004) . Similarly, Vpu of HIV-1 was shown to be a voltage-gated proton selective channel in electrophysiological studies (Dube et al., 2010; Gazina and Petrou, 2012) . A cation selective behavior has been reported for HCV p7 (Griffin et al., 2003; Premkumar et al., 2004) , togavirus 6 K and the notorious coronavirus envelope small membrane protein (E); causative agent of SARS, MERS and the current outbreak COVID-19 (Lu et al., 2006) . HCV p7 was shown to be a pH-gated proton channel with genotype-dependent specific sensitivity to channel blocking drugs (Breitinger et al., 2016) . Another reported activity of viroporins is the alteration of intracellular calcium homeostasis where entry of extracellular calcium and/or Ca 2+ leakage from intracellular stores, such as the mitochondria, ER and Golgi complex has been observed (Triantafilou et al., 2013a) . Certain viroporins, such as P2B, polyprotein P2BC and P3A from poliovirus (Aldabe et al., 1996) or envelope small membrane protein (E) from coronavirus induce intracellular membrane remodeling to generate new membrane vesicles (called the viroplasm) that serve as viral replication sites (Lu et al., 2006; Agirre et al., 2002) . Several studies have claimed the involvement of viroporins in virus induced programmed cell death such as the case with coronavirus E protein and picornavirus 2B viroporin . This was attributed to perturbation of ion homeostasis, a common hallmark of apoptosis, which causes depolarization of the plasma membrane associated with intracellular cations overload and cell volume decreases as a result of anions and H 2 O efflux (Gonzalez and Carrasco, 2003; Ueda et al., 2010) .",

They are multi-protein complexes made up of a sensor protein, the adaptor protein ASC, and the cellular protease caspase-1 (Schroder and Tschopp, 2010) . Caspases are cysteine proteases that initiate or execute cellular programs, leading to inflammation or cell death. Inflammasomes activate a class of caspases known as inflammatory caspases . Inflammatory caspases in mammals have a CARD domain followed by a domain containing the catalytic residue cysteine (Boatright and Salvesen, 2003; Martinon et al., 2002) . Caspase-1 itself is synthesized as an inactive 45 kDa zymogen (pro-caspase-1) that undergoes autocatalytic processing following an appropriate stimulus (Boatright and Salvesen, 2003) . It is activated within the inflammasome multiprotein complex via interaction with ASC (apoptosisassociated speck-like protein containing a carboxy-terminal CARD), a bipartite adapter protein that bridges NLRs and caspase-1 (Nadiri et al., 2006) . The proinflammatory cytokines of the IL-1 family, most notably IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 play very important roles in antimicrobial host defense (Dinarello, 2009 ). IL-1\u03b2 activates the release of other proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IL-6, and induce a Th17 bias in the cellular adaptive responses as shown in Fig. 1 (Davis et al., 2011) . It is also responsible for the acute phase response, which includes fever, acute protein synthesis, anorexia, and somnolence. and coordinates programs as diverse as cellular recruitment to the site of infection or injury and regulation of sleep, appetite, and body temperature (Martinon et al., 2009) . IL-18 is another member of the IL-1 family that acts as an important regulator of innate and acquired immune responses. It is produced during chronic inflammation, in autoimmune diseases, in a variety of cancers, and in the context of numerous infectious diseases (Gracie et al., 2003) . IL-18 induces the production of multiple cytokines including IFN-\u03b3, IL-13, IL-4, IL-8 as well as both Th1 and Th2 lymphokines, and is an important stimulator of antigen-activated Th1 cells (Shereck et al., 2012) . Through these mechanisms, cytokines of the IL-1 family are a crucial component of the host defense (Dinarello, 2009 (Dinarello, , 1984 .",

It is now generally accepted that activation and release of IL-1\u03b2 requires two distinct signals. The nature of these signals in-vivo during infection or inflammation is not completely defined (Negash et al., 2013; Latz et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2019) . However, in-vitro studies showed that the first signal can be triggered by various PAMPs and DAMPs following toll-like receptor (TLR) activation, which induces the synthesis of pro IL-1\u03b2 (Negash et al., 2013; Pang and Iwasaki, 2011) . The second signal is triggered by different DAMPS and PAPMS promoting NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and caspase-1-mediated activation of pro IL-1\u03b2 and pro IL-18. The requirement for a second signal for IL-1\u03b2 maturation might constitute a fail-safe mechanism to ensure that the induction of potent inflammatory responses occurs only in the presence of a bona fide stimulus, such as pathogen infection and/or tissue injury (Christgen and Kanneganti, 2019) . Signals required for activation and secretion of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 are summarized in Fig. 2 .",

A number of host-derived molecules, which are indicative of injury, activate the NLRP3 inflammasome. ATP and certain bacterial toxins, such as nigericin and maitotoxin, cause a change in the intracellular ion composition leading to the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome (Muruve et al., 2008) . The NLRP3 inflammasome also detects signs of metabolic stress, including elevated extracellular glucose and monosodium urate (MSU) crystals. Three models have been proposed to explain the mechanisms leading to NLRP3 activation; the first model adopts pore formation in cellular membrane as a mechanism that allows extracellular NLRP3 agonists to access the cytosol and directly interact with NLRP3 (Kanneganti et al., 2007) . A second model was proposed for activators that form crystalline or particulate structures, such as silica, asbestos, amyloid \u03b2, and alum, wherein engulfment of these agonists by phagocytes leads to lysosomal damage, resulting in cytosolic release of lysosomal contents that are somehow sensed by the NLRP3 inflammasome Hornung et al., 2008) . According to a third model, all NLRP3 agonists trigger the generation of reactive Oxygen species (ROS), and this common pathway engages the NLRP3 inflammasome (Cruz et al., 2007) . The production of ROS represents one of the most evolutionarily conserved pathways of response to infection or injury. The source of ROS is under debate where some studies claim one or several NADPH oxidases to be involved, while others support mitochondrial origin (Cruz et al., 2007) . A recent report associates a ROS-sensitive NLRP3 ligand, thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP/VDUP1), in NLRP3 activation (Xiao et al., 2016) .",

TLR7 of dendritic cells recognizes influenza genomic RNA, providing signal 1 that is required for the transcription and synthesis of pro IL-1\u03b2 and pro IL-18 (Ichinohe et al., 2010) . The second signal is provided by M2 ion channel activity across the trans-Golgi network (TGN) (Sakaguchi et al., 1996) . M2 protein was reported to assist in influenza viral entry into the cell by equilibrating the pH of the virus within the acidifying endosome. This step crucial to facilitate replication of the viral genome by disruption of the interactions between the viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complex and the matrix protein, M1, which coats the vRNP (Wang et al., 1994) . In addition, the M2 channel allows protons from the acidic TGN to neutralize the pH of its lumen in order to prevent the premature maturation of hemagglutinin to its low-pH fusogenic form (Ichinohe et al., 2010; Sakaguchi et al., 1996) .",

It was shown that the M2del29-31 mutant of the influenza virus (lacking amino acids 29-31 from the transmembrane region of the M2 protein) completely failed to stimulate inflammasome activation and release of IL-1\u03b2 or IL-18 from BMM and BMDCs (Ichinohe et al., 2010) . In addition, mature caspase-1 and IL-1\u03b2 were only detected in the supernatants of cells infected with wild-type influenza, but not M2del29-31 mutant virus, despite the fact that M2del29-31 mutant was capable of infecting target cells to an extent comparable to the wild-type virus. M2del29-31 mutant virus-infected cells also expressed comparable amounts of pro IL-1\u03b2 mRNA (Ichinohe et al., 2010) . It was also shown that bone marrow derived macrophages (BMMs) and bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs), stimulated with LPS (signal 1) and transduced with a lentivirus expressing the M2 protein derived from H1N1, were capable of producing both IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 compared to controls. In unprimed BMM, however, M2 expression alone was not sufficient to trigger IL-1\u03b2 release. This confirms the hypothesis that pathogen-encoded ion channels, in addition to more drastic disruption of membranes by pore-forming toxins or membrane rupture, can trigger signal 2 for NLRP3 inflammasome activation (Ichinohe et al., 2010) . In a different study, it was reported that M2dependent IL-1\u03b2 production of influenza virus could be blocked by high concentration of extracellular K + or by treating cells with ROS inhibitors (Allen et al., 2009 ). M2 and NLRP3 dependent IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 secretion also occurs in human dendritic cells infected with influenza virus (Fernandez et al., 2016) .",

RSV can activate NLRP3/ASC inflammasome via activation of the TLR2/MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response 88)/nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) pathway for pro IL-1\u03b2 synthesis. The second signal, however, was shown to be provided by a small hydrophobic (SH) viroporin encoded by RSV (Segovia et al., 2012; Ravi Kumar et al., 2018; Shil et al., 2018) . Another study by Triantafilou et al. (2013b) confirmed these findings and showed that SH viroporin accumulates in the Golgi within lipid raft structures, forming ion channels selective for monovalent cations (Na + and K + ). This triggers the translocation of NLRP3 from the cytoplasm to the Golgi and its activation. Moreover an SH deletion mutant RSV rgRSV-GF (\u0394SHRSV lacking the viroporin SH) can grow and replicate efficiently in cell culture but is unable to trigger inflammasome activation or stimulate the production of IL-1\u03b2 Triantafilou et al. (2013b) . However, in the same study, IL-6 a non-inflammasome cytokine, as well as IFN\u03b2 and pro IL-1\u03b2 were produced normally Triantafilou et al. (2013b) . Several viroporin inhibitors were also examined in RSV infected cellular models. ",

Studies have shown elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2 in both infections (Davis et al., 2011) . A study by Dolinay et al. (Dolinay et al., 2012) showed that inflammasome-regulated cytokines IL-18 and IL-1\u03b2 are crucial mediators of acute lung injury in mouse models, implicating the important role of inflammasome pathway and its downstream cytokines in respiratory inflammation (Dolinay et al., 2012) . The activation of such receptors leads to the activation of NF-\u03baB which induces the synthesis of pro-IL-1\u03b2. The second signal is provided by the activation of the inflammasome complex and caspase-1 leading to IL-1\u03b2 processing. NLRP3 inflammasome detects signs of metabolic stress, including elevated extracellular glucose, monosodium urate (MSU) crystals, ATP and changes in the intracellular ion composition caused by viral encoded ion channels; viroporins activity and certain bacterial toxins, such as nigericin and maitotoxi. NLRP3 oligomerization leads to PYD domain clustering and presentation for homotypic interaction with the PYD-and CARD-containing adaptor ASC, whose CARD domain in turn recruits the CARD of procaspase-1. Procaspase-1 clustering permits autocleavage and formation of the active caspase-1 p10/p20 tetramer. Caspase-1 is activated within the inflammasome multiprotein complex through interaction with ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a carboxy-terminal CARD), a bipartite adapter protein that bridges NLRs and caspase-1. Fig. 3 . Viroporins activity and activation of inflammasomes. Viroporins activities can be clustered into three main groups that have been linked to activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes. The first group of viroporins pumps protons and dissipates proton gradient across trans-golgi network, eg.M2 of influenza A virus. The second group manipulates Ca 2+ homeostasis, stimulating Ca 2+ flux from intracellular storages to the cytosol providing the second signal for NLRP3 activation and IL-1\u03b2 production such as 2B of polio and rhino virus. The third group increases mitochondrial stress and affects ROS production such as 3a of corona virus.",

While untransfected cells or those transfected with the gene encoding the EMCV non-structural protein 2A or 2C expressed NLRP3 uniformly throughout the cytoplasm, NLRP3 was redistributed to the perinuclear space only in cells transfected with the gene encoding the EMCV 2B or influenza virus M2 protein Ito et al.

Ca 2+ flux from intracellular storages to the cytosol can be the mechanism by which EMCV activates the NLRP3 inflammasome, since IL-1\u03b2 production was not affected by inhibitors of mitochondrial ROS and cathepsin B, which effectively blocked ATP and alum-induced IL-1\u03b2 secretion, respectively Ito et al.

P7 was reported to substitute for the well-characterized M2 vioporin of Influenza (Griffin et al., 2004) where it was able to dissipate the proton gradient across exocytic vesicles as well as the TGN to prevent acid induced premature fusogenic conformational changes of multi basic haemagglutinin (Ciampor et al., 1992) . The ion channel was also reported to cause global loss of organelle acidity upon expression (Wozniak et al., 2010) . Reports have shown that IL-1\u03b2 levels are higher in HCV induced liver diseases than in other forms of liver damage, however the mechanism by which HCV infection activates NLRP3 is still under investigation (Negash et al., 2013; Farag et al., 2017; Negash et al., 2019) . Monocyte-derived human macrophages (THP-1) incubated with cell culture-grown HCV enhance the secretion of IL-1\u03b2/IL-18 into culture supernatants. A similar cytokine release was also observed for peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-derived primary human macrophages and Kupffer cells (liverresident macrophages) upon incubation with HCV. THP-1 cells incubated with HCV led to caspase-1 activation and release of proinflammatory cytokines. Subsequent studies demonstrated that HCV induces pro IL-1\u03b2 and pro IL-18 synthesis via the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway in macrophages. Furthermore, introduction of HCV viroporin p7 RNA into THP-1 cells was sufficient to cause IL-1\u03b2 secretion (Shrivastava et al., 2013) .",
