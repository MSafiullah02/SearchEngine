However the overlapping clinical presentations, complex medical and surgical comorbidities, and numerous medications often complicate diagnosis. Some dermatologic emergencies are primarily reactive and require immunosuppression such as pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) while others are a sign of systemic infection and require antimicrobials, such as staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. Many primary inflammatory disorders, such as Steven\u2013Johnson syndrome (SJS), can develop secondary infections and further complicate diagnosis and management. This chapter reviews the most common dermatologic emergencies seen in cancer patients, diagnostic dilemmas, and treatment options. Typical cases with photographs are also presented.",

The majority of patients recover completely after drug withdrawal. As the DRESS syndrome may be complicated by exfoliative dermatitis, patients may benefit from intensive care or burn unit settings. Supportive therapy aims at stabilization and includes antipyretics to reduce fever, and topical steroids to alleviate cutaneous symptoms. Clinicians should avoid giving empiric antibiotics during the acute stages of DRESS syndrome because it may confound or exacerbate the clinical condition due to an unexplained cross-reactivity between drugs. If exfoliative dermatitis is present, therapy is nearly identical to that of major burns, and includes fluid replacement, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, warming the environmental temperature, providing high caloric intake, treatment of superinfections, and skin care with appropriate dressings. Systemic corticosteroid therapy for DRESS is currently the most widely accepted treatment. A minimum dose of 1 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent is recommended, along with a gradual taper over 3\u20136 months after clinical stabilization is noted. If no improvement (or exacerbation of symptoms occurs), intravenous methylprednisone may be used. Alternative steroid-sparing therapies may be attempted in patients that do not respond to systemic steroids, and include IVIG (1 g/kg for 2 days), plasmapheresis, or immunosuppressive drugs (cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, interferons, muromonab-CD3, mycophenolate mofetil, or rituximab). Most patients with DRESS syndrome will undergo complete recovery after withdrawal of the causative drug. Patients should be monitored for several months and late onset of cardiac and thyroid abnormalities has been reported. The estimated mortality of DRESS syndrome is 10 %, with the most common cause of death related to hepatic necrosis [14].",

The initial lesion expands peripherally and leads to an ulcer formation. The edge of the ulcer is often bluish or violaceous, with its base purulent and necrotic. The depth of the ulcer can extend into the subcutaneous fat and may reach fascial planes [18]. In contrast, bullous PGpresents on the arms and face and results in inflammatory bullous lesions; there is a strong association with hematologic disease. Pustular PG typically occurs in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and presents as multiple small pustules and erosions on the oral mucosa. Vegetative PG consists of a localized, solitary superficial form of PG that is verrucous in nature and often occurs in the head and neck region [19].",

Wound dressings that maintain a moist environment are critical to healing. Due to the potential for pathergy(worsening of PG at sites of tissue injury), unnecessary trauma should be avoided; for this same reason, the role of surgery in PG is controversial. Patients with mild, localized PG limited to a few superficial ulcers may experience improvement with high potency, topical corticosteroid therapy, or topical tacrolimus. Extensive PG may require treatment with systemic glucocorticoids (0.5\u20131.5 mg/kg daily of oral prednisone, or 1 g methylprednisolone intravenously administered for 1\u20135 days), or cyclosporine (4\u20135 mg/kg). Immunomodulatory agents are useful in PG. Infliximab has shown efficacy and may be particularly helpful in patients who require treatment of both PG and Crohn\u2019s disease. With treatment, more than half of patients with PG achieve wound healing within 1 year, and the vast majority of patients undergo remission. Because of a strong association between bullous PG and hematologic disease, patients who present with bullous PG should be followed closely to ascertain for the development of an underlying hematologic disorder [16].",

For those patients with clinical grade II\u2013IV acute GVHD, intravenous steroids at a dose of 1\u20132 mg/kg per day are required, with a slow taper and transition to oral steroids once control of GVHD has been achieved. Clinical stage IV acute cutaneous GVHD results in widespread skin desquamation (Fig. 22.15) that in addition to systemic steroids requires restoration of the epidermal barrier via emollients and occlusive dressings, electrolyte monitoring/replacement, and cooling measures for patients that develop fever secondary to vasodilatation.",

A positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) suggests the presence of an underlying connective tissue disorder, such as systemic lupus erythematosus. Low serum complement levels may occur in both mixed cryoglobulinemic and lupus vasculitis, but not other types. The presence of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) directed against protease-3 strongly suggests that granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and ANCA against myeloperoxidase favors microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). ANCA may be positive in drug-induced vasculitis and Churg-Strauss disease [47, 48]. Tissue biopsy of the most clinically involved area is essential for diagnosis. Cutaneous vasculitis is confirmed by the identification of an inflammatory process resulting in vessel wall damage and includes angiocentric infiltrates and fibrin deposition within vessel walls or lumen. Punch biopsies of cutaneous vasculitis lesions ideally should be taken from a lesion that is 24\u201348 h old. Direct immunofluorescence (DIF) should also be performed, as this test is important for the diagnosis of Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura (where IgA deposition is detected), and other immune-complex-mediated vasculitides [49].",
