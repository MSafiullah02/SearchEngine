Size structure was predicted from position of the study reach in the watershed, from channel gradient, and from composition of the salmonid community. Brook trout were predominantly small in high-elevation, moderate-gradient, forested reaches with allopatric populations; they were larger in mid-elevation, low-gradient, meadow reaches that contained some brown trout. Brown trout were mostly small in mid-elevation, moderate-gradient, forested reaches; however, more large brown trout occurred lower in the watersheds, in meadow or rangeland stream reaches that had low gradients and that supported allopatric populations.",

Such models are useful because they help pinpoint the habitat variables that may limit the standing stock of fish in streams. However, models that predict standing stock do not elucidate the size structure-the abundance of fish of different lengths-of the stock, even though the quality of sport fisheries depends heavily on size structure (Anderson and Weithman 1978) . For example, some populations of brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis may have high standing stocks, but the fish may be stunted and include few large individuals (Johnson 1989) . Currently there is little knowledge of the factors governing size structure of salmonid populations in mountain streams.",

No water diversions or water storage structures that would alter the natural hydrography were upstream from the study reaches. The hydrograph was typical of Rocky Mountain streams: flows peaked in spring and were low in fall and winter (Wesche 1982) . Study reaches ranged from 2,377 to 2,975 m above mean sea level. Vegetation in the study area was primarily spruce Picea spp. and fir Abies spp. in subalpine areas, and lodgepole pine Pinus contorta in mountain areas. Willows Salix spp., sedges Carex spp., and various grasses dominated mountain meadows; sagebrush Artemisia spp., willows, and grasses dominated foothill areas.",

In 1986, transects were spaced 4 m apart and point measurements were made at seven equally spaced locations, plus at each bank. Water depth was measured at each point and al the bank, but the bank measurements were excluded from calculations of mean depth. Cover, dominant substrate, embeddedness, and microhabitat were visually classified at each point across a transect. Cover was classified into three categories: aquatic vegetation, woody debris, and boulder. Substrate was classified into six categories (after Platts et al. 1983 ; diameter in parentheses): small sediment (^0.8 mm), large sediment (0.9-4.7 mm), gravel (4.8-76.0 mm), cobble (77-304 mm), small boulder (305-609 mm), and large boulder (>610 mm). Embeddedness (amount of fine sediment surrounding the underlying substrate particles) was rated from zero to 100% (Platts et al. 1983) . Habitat types were classified according to Bisson et al. (1982) . Water depth at the shore, presence of overhanging bank (as defined by Wesche et al. 1987) , and extent of overhanging vegetation were determined at each bank. Bank angle was determined with a clinometer (Platts et al. 1983 ).",

Small-mesh seines (<3-mm-diameter openings) were used to block the upper and lower sections of each reach, and three depletion passes were made with a backpack electroshocker. Fish were weighed to the nearest 1 g and measured to the nearest 0.1 cm; all fish lengths are given as total lengths. Only fish longer than 10.0 cm were considered fully recruited into the fishery and were used in the population estimates and in the evaluations of size structure.

High proportions of quality-size brook trout were also positively associated with conductivity and alkalinity, which tended to be highest in larger streams at low elevations. Five variables were correlated with the proportion of quality-size brown trout (Table 3) . Abundant quality-size brown trout were associated with high standing stocks of brown trout, as well as with two chemical features indicative of high biological productivity-conductivity and alkalinity-as was the case with brook trout. The proportion of quality-size brown trout was negatively correlated with overhanging vegetation. The best discriminant models classified reaches into the three groups-reaches with few qualitysize fish, those with abundant quality-size fish, or those without the species of interest-on the basis of seven or eight variables (Tables 4, 5). Multicolinearity was not a problem because there were no high uni variate correlations among these variables (all r < 0.70). AH discriminant functions were significant (P < 0.05), based on the amount of residual discrimination (Wilks* lambda). The first functions accounted for the most variance (95% for brook trout, 86% for brown trout) and were most related to the groups (canonical correlations were 94% for brook trout and 85% for brown trout) for each model being assessed.

Brown trout feed on small trout (Alexander 1977; Gosse and Helm 1981; Bachman 1984) , so selective predation on small brook trout by larger brown trout may have increased the average size of brook trout in mid-elevation reaches. Fausch and White (1981) suggested that brown trout can competitively exclude brook trout from streams. It seems plausible that large brook trout can compete with brown trout but that small brook trout can be excluded from areas of optimal habitat. This conclusion was supported by Bachman (1984) , who observed that only large brown trout were able to exclude smaller trout from optimal areas. Thus, competition with brown trout may lead to an enhanced size structure of brook trout in mid-elevation reaches but exclude brook trout at low elevations.",

Undercut banks, aquatic vegetation, and deep pools (mostly trench pools) were more abundant in low-gradient reaches than in moderate-gradient reaches . Such habitat provides refuges near invertebrate drift lanes (Fausch 1984 ) and areas of low light intensity (Gosse and Helm 1981) . Wesche (1980) found that undercut banks were critical habitat for brown trout. Large brown trout are more coveroriented than small brown trout (Bachman 1984) and need large and deep pools with cover to overwinter (Cunjak and Power 1986) . The needs of large brown trout seem to be met more fully by the cover features common to low-gradient reaches in meadows and rangelands than by the features common in higher-gradient forested reaches. Kozel and Hubert (1987) found that brook trout collected from two streams (elevation, >2,750 m above mean sea level) within our study area of Medicine Bow National Forest were significantly older when aged with otoliths than when aged with scales. Maximum age of brook trout that were aged with otoliths was 9 years, but the maximum was only 5 years for those aged with scales. The mean total length of 4-year-old brook trout aged with otoliths was 18.9 cm. The observations of Kozel and Hubert (1987) suggest that quality-size brook trout (20 cm) of streams in Medicine Bow National Forest are at least 5 years old. Similar information on brown trout aged with otoliths is not available.",

The models can assist managers in identifying stream reaches where (1) habitat improvement could yield significant fisheries values, (2) stocking brown trout could enhance fisheries quality, or (3) more-restrictive harvests (i.e., size restrictions) could increase the abundance of quality-size fish. The models have not been tested with an independent data set, so their applicability to streams outside Medicine Bow National Forest is unknown. We encourage others to develop similar models elsewhere based on the same variables.",
