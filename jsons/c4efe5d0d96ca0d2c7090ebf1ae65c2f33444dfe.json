While some have advocated the use of 10 % phenylephrine to aid in dilation of rodents [8, 9] , this is generally not required. Pharmacologic dilation is most commonly performed using tropicamide at a concentration of 0.5 % for rodents and 1 % for larger mammals. The ophthalmologist should be familiar with the length of time required to achieve mydriasis and the duration of the mydriasis for the species being examined. In general, 10-15 min is the minimum time required to achieve acceptable mydriasis and this may be slightly longer in heavily pigmented eyes. The duration of mydriasis is directly related to the amount of intraocular melanin. In albinotic rodents, mydriasis will last no more than 1 h while in a pigmented eye of a dog or a primate the effect will persist for 3-5 h. This information is important so that the ophthalmologist knows when to begin dilation and how many animals should be dilated at one time. The later will depend on how many animals the ophthalmologist can examine in a given time period. For the basic examination, biomicroscopy, and indirect ophthalmoscopy, animals are either manually restrained (rodent, dog, rabbit, pig, guinea pig, cat) or sedated or anesthetized (primates). Rats and mice may be held in a dose-hold and presented to the ophthalmologist with their heads restrained. Some ophthalmologists prefer the eyes to be slightly proptosed in rodents. Dogs and rabbits are most often examined on a table. Rabbits seem to do best if there is a towel on the table as this decreases their movements and may provide some comfort. For rabbits, the ophthalmologist should be seated slightly below the level of the restraint table to allow easy visualization of the rabbits' optic nerve and retinal vasculature which are located in the superior fundus. For dogs, the examiner may be seated or standing. Since primates will be anesthetized or heavily sedated, they may be manually restrained or placed on an examination table. If more extensive examinations such as electrodiagnostic testing or OCT are required sedation or anesthesia may be required regardless of the species.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 236, "end": 239, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 240, "end": 242, "text": "9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Routine Examination"}, {"text": "Additional examination procedures such as direct ophthalmoscopy, corneal staining, tonometry, pachymetry, fluorescein angiography, photographic documentation (anterior or posterior segment), electrodiagnostic testing, ultrasonography, OCT, and other tests may be indicated depending on the study and toxicologic effects of interest. If any of these additional tests are required, the order in which tests are performed and when to perform pupil dilation must be considered. For example, determination of intraocular pressure (IOP) should be performed prior to pupil dilation. In addition, if repeated IOP measurements are required during a study they should be performed at the same time of day to avoid diurnal pressure fluctuation. When possible, examination of the cornea should be performed prior to procedures that may result in corneal changes as a result of corneal contact (pachymetry, tonometry) or the use of topical anesthesia. If sedation is required for the ophthalmic examination then consideration must be given to dosing and feeding schedules, clinical observations, and clinical pathology sampling.

The presence or the absence of a tapetum and whether the animal has a fovea should be considered. In addition, the examination techniques to be used, type of biomicroscope and indirect ophthalmoscope, size and diopter of the indirect lens, and number of animals that can be examined in an hour must be understood. The role of the veterinary ophthalmologist is to perform a pretest examination designed to eliminate those animals not suited to the study and to establish a baseline database to compare interim and end-ofstudy findings. Animals are then subsequently examined one or more times during the study, at the conclusion of the study, and possibly in a recovery phase depending on the study duration and design. Typically studies are divided into acute, subacute, subchronic, and chronic depending on the duration.

A single ophthalmologist generally requires 2-3 animal handlers, a data entry individual, and in studies over 250 animals 1-2 individuals to go ahead of the animal handlers to dilate the pupils. For efficiency, an animal should be in front of the ophthalmologist at all times.

Other CROs may have their own in-house online or hand recording system. The ophthalmologist should be familiar with each laboratory's recording system and terminology to be consistent both within and between studies. When an abnormality is observed, correlation between dose groups is important when evaluating the incidence and severity of lesions so that any association with the test article can be assessed [1] .

In general, a grading scheme of slight, moderate, and severe/marked is most common. When using this grading scheme for the transparent media (cornea, aqueous, lens, and vitreous) a grading of slight would imply a lesion that does not obstruct visualization of the deeper tissues past the lesion, a moderate grade implies a lesion that interferes with but does not fully obstruct the view of the tissues deep to the lesion, and a severe/marked lesion fully obstructs the view of structures deep to the lesion (Table 1 ). This is analogous to the terms incipient, immature, and mature when applied to a cataract. Lesions may also be characterized with respect to the area of involvement with the terms most commonly used being focal, multifocal, and diffuse. For studies involving topical ophthalmic application of a drug or an ocular/intraocular device a specific more detailed biomicroscopic examination protocol with standardized scoring or grading criteria is frequently used. This is most commonly the modified Hackett-Mc-Donald scoring system (Tables 2 and 3 ) [10, 11] .

Biomicroscopy provides a magnified view of the living eye using a light that can be varied in intensity, width, height, and color. In general for laboratory animals, this is performed using a handheld slit lamp of the ophthalmologist's preference. The slit lamp used for routine examination should be portable, lightweight, and easy to use on a variety of species. The two most common portable slit lamps used for laboratory animals are the Zeiss HSO-10 ( Fig. 1 ) and the Kowa SL-14/15 (Fig. 2) . The Zeiss HSO-10 provides a 12\u00c2 magnification with a 125 mm working distance and is both lightweight and easy to use on all species. The Kowa SL-14/15 has either a 10\u00c2 or a 16\u00c2 magnification with a 100 mm working distance. Unlike the Zeiss, the Kowa works from a battery pack and is re-charged in a stand. Both have fixed slit widths (0.15 and 0.75 mm Zeiss; 0.1, 0.2, and 0.8 mm Kowa) and both have a cobalt blue filter for fluorescein. If higher magnification or photographic documentation are required, a table-mounted slit lamp may be used (Fig. 3) . Table slit lamps provide higher quality optics, increased magnification, and variable width and height of the slit beam and with additional attachments can allow for photographic documentation, gonioscopy, or specular microscopy. Table slit lamps are however significantly more expensive, less portable, and more difficult to use on a large number of animals or un-sedated animals. The slit lamp performs two major functions. First, it provides magnification for a more detailed examination of the eye. Secondly it makes use of the slit beam, decreasing the beam of light to a slit allowing an optical cross section of the eye to be obtained (Figs. 4 and 5) . This allows precise localization of the depth of a lesion and allows visualization of subtle changes that cannot be seen with full illumination (Figs. 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10) .

In addition, when performing direct ophthalmoscopy any opacity of the cornea, aqueous, lens, or vitreous will severely impair or prevent visualization of the posterior segment. Prior to indirect ophthalmoscopy, a short-acting mydriatic agent is required to dilate the pupil. Tropicamide 0.5-1.0 % is the mydriatic of choice. When examining using indirect ophthalmoscopy, the examiner remains at arm's length and places the condensing lens just anterior to the cornea. This technique is used to examine the posterior vitreous, optic nerve, retinal vasculature, retina, and choroid. In addition, opacities of the clear media (cornea, aqueous, lens, and vitreous) are readily detectable using retroillumination. This technique can be used to grade vitreous inflammation/opacification (Table 6 ).

The breed-related abnormalities will vary according to the supplier and are often seen with a prevalence that waxes and wanes according to the current sires and dams. For example in the author's experience, micropapilla is more common in a specific supplier's beagles, but rare in beagles from other suppliers. Keep in mind that these are tightly controlled breeding programs to yield a beagle with specific characteristics and their ocular lesions while similar in kind may differ in prevalence from the pet beagles seen in a clinical setting. In the author's experience, prolapse of the gland of the nictitans (Fig. 30) , retinal dysplasia (folds) (Figs. 31 and 32), optic nerve micropapilla/hypoplasia (Fig. 33) , and incipient posterior cortical or anterior suture cataract (Figs. 6, 34, and 35) are the most common breed-related findings in the laboratory beagle [17, 18, 21, 40] . These are similar to the previously reported prevalence of ophthalmic findings in 8-10-month-old beagles (Table 7 ) [17] . Corneal dystrophy is also observed in the laboratory beagle [19, 20] . It should be noted that corneal dystrophy, cataracts, and retinal degeneration may also be noted as a treatment-related finding (Figs. 36, 37, and 38) . The beagle has a holangiotic retina and, unlike most laboratory animal species, has a tapetum located in the superior choroid (Fig. 27) . The tapetum is cellular in nature and is located between the large choroidal vessels and the choriocapillaris in the dorsal aspect of the fundus. The tapetal color is variable with blue, green, orange, and yellow the most common variations. There are also atapetal beagles, usually color dilute, which are reported to have tapetal cells that are deficient in tapetal rodlets [41] . The tapetum can have a role in ocular toxicity [42] and in such instances atapetal beagles can be used. The tapetum of the dog contains a high concentration of zinc and as such zinc chelators may result in Fig. 30 Prolapse of the gland of the nictitans with associated mucoid epiphora, conjunctival hyperemia, and a focal corneal opacity tapetal necrosis and secondary retinopathy [43] . Additional drugassociated lens and retinal changes have also been described in the beagle (Figs. 37 and 38) [44, 45] . In general, young animals are more likely to have PH or PPM (Figs. 10, 14, and 41 ). In one report the prevalence of hyaloid remnants may be as high as 60 % at 6 weeks of age, but decrease to less than 17 % by 1 year of age [26, 52, 53] . In mice, the prevalence of a PH has been reported to range between 28 and 32 % with a higher prevalence in females [48] . On a pretest examination, animals with PPM/PH and associated hemorrhage (vitreous, aqueous) should typically be eliminated from the study if possible (Fig. 14) . Anterior synechia, microophthalmos, and anterior cleavage anomalies are also occasionally seen as congenital ocular anomalies in rats and mice. The term corneal dystrophy implies a bilateral, noninflammatory inherited, degenerative disorder and is a specific term. Unfortunately, the terms corneal opacity or corneal crystals are also used and are less specific and more general terms. The term calcific band keratopathy has also been applied to the lesions observed in rodents [43] . Clinically, the lesions of corneal dystrophy most commonly appear as fine granular or linear opacities in the nasal and axial palpebral fissure (Figs. 17-19) . They are most frequently bilateral. Histologically, corneal dystrophy in rodents is typically a basement membrane, anterior stromal corneal defect resulting in deposits of mineral and phospholipid in and adjacent to the epithelial basement membrane (Fig. 42) [34, 43] . Corneal dystrophy, while common in a pretest examination, will be observed to increase in prevalence and severity with age. Corneal dystrophy is common in rats and less common in mice, and varies in prevalence, appearance, and severity by strain of rat/mouse, sex, age, and shipment and supplier. It is more prevalent in males and increases in prevalence and in some species severity with age [23] . The prevalence will vary from 5 to 100 % [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] . It has been variously termed corneal dystrophy, calcific keratopathy, corneal opacity, corneal calcification, and spontaneous corneal degeneration. It has also been reproduced experimentally in rats by corneal desiccation which can occur secondary to dehydration, a decrease in blink rate, sedation, or anesthesia. As it increases in severity with age it can be associated with secondary keratitis (typically nasal), especially in the Fischer 344 rat (Fig. 43 ). In addition, keratitis can occur secondary to anesthesia, corneal exposure, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, sialodacryoadenitis (SDA), environment (dust, irritants), and conjunctivitis.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 162, "end": 166, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 167, "end": 171, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 172, "end": 176, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 177, "end": 180, "text": "23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1051, "end": 1055, "text": "[17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1056, "end": 1059, "text": "18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1060, "end": 1063, "text": "21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1064, "end": 1067, "text": "40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1186, "end": 1190, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1253, "end": 1257, "text": "[19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1258, "end": 1261, "text": "20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1930, "end": 1934, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1984, "end": 1988, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 2318, "end": 2322, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 2433, "end": 2437, "text": "[44,", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 2438, "end": 2441, "text": "45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 2668, "end": 2672, "text": "[26,", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2673, "end": 2676, "text": "52,", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 2677, "end": 2680, "text": "53]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 2798, "end": 2802, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 3445, "end": 3449, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 3871, "end": 3875, "text": "[34,", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 3876, "end": 3879, "text": "43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 4275, "end": 4279, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 4323, "end": 4327, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 4328, "end": 4332, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 4333, "end": 4337, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 4338, "end": 4342, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 4343, "end": 4347, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 4348, "end": 4352, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 4353, "end": 4357, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 795, "end": 804, "text": "(Fig. 30)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 888, "end": 897, "text": "(Fig. 33)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 1175, "end": 1183, "text": "(Table 7", "ref_id": "TABREF12"}, {"start": 1392, "end": 1414, "text": "(Figs. 36, 37, and 38)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 1543, "end": 1552, "text": "(Fig. 27)", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}, {"start": 2143, "end": 2150, "text": "Fig. 30", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 2504, "end": 2525, "text": "(Figs. 10, 14, and 41", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 2955, "end": 2964, "text": "(Fig. 14)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 3596, "end": 3609, "text": "(Figs. 17-19)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 3861, "end": 3870, "text": "(Fig. 42)", "ref_id": "FIGREF34"}, {"start": 4811, "end": 4819, "text": "(Fig. 43", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "Beagle"}, {"text": "Cataracts may be seen during pretest screening and are most often nuclear (Fig. 39) .

It requires topical anesthesia of which 0.5 % proparacaine is the most common topical ophthalmic anesthetic of choice. This technique measures the force required to applanate or flatten a given area of cornea and then converts this into an IOP value in mmHg. These tonometers have the advantage of being able to be self-calibrated for a GLP study (Fig. 56 ) and the pneumotonograph can also provide a hard paper copy for record keeping. The Tonpen XL and Tonopen Vet \u00ae obtain four independent readings, average them, and indicate both the IOP and the % error indicating the variability between the four readings obtained. The Tonopen Avia \u00ae obtains ten independent readings, averages them, and reports the IOP and reports the variability in readings as a % confidence. For the Tonopen XL \u00ae the % error should be <5 % and for the Tonopen Avia \u00ae the % confidence should be >95 %. Rebound tonometry determines IOP by firing a small plastic tip against the cornea. The tip then rebounds back into the device creating an induction current from which the IOP is calculated. The probe must be fired at the cornea in the horizontal position, parallel to the floor to be accurate. The most common rebound tonometer for laboratory animals is the Tonovet \u00ae (Fig. 57) .
