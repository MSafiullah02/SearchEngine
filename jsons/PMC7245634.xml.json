            "text": "Effective risk management and assessment require knowledge of past events to generate comparative risk scenarios. Yet understanding the impacts of environmental stress on historical societies is an underdeveloped and fragmented field of study, with substantial disagreement among specialists. As a result, we cannot say with precision what constitutes an existential risk to a given historical society, i.e., a risk that could trigger the collapse of a political or cultural system. Past human societies as a whole have been extraordinarily resilient in the face of severe challenges, but the configuration of social and political structures was always impacted in a number of ways, with substantial implications for development pathways (e.g., the different medium-term outcomes of the Black Death in England and France) (Borsch 2005, pp. 55\u201366; Herlihy 1997). Historical case studies, therefore, can offer valuable guidance on present day issues in designing risk management strategies and sustainable policies (Haldon and Rosen 2018; Rosen 2007). Detailed research into what, if any, role environmental challenges have played in the transformation of previous societies, including in conflict, migration, critical systems failure, and politics, is an essential requirement, along with grounded inquiry into socio-economic feedback loops.",

But it can also tell us about what happened when the dust settled and how both leaders and governments and the members of society more broadly re-evaluated their situations. There are several key questions that historical case studies reveal. Did people in the more distant past think about system recovery? We show that this depends significantly on system structure and capacity, nuanced and constrained by ideological assumptions. Contemporaries perceived the scope of recovery within a state as a goal, but were focused on their own institutions, while considering recovery at a global scale was rare and conceptualized and promoted generally within the purview of religion. Were people aware and did they respond, negatively or positively, to changes in their (perceived) social situation, impacts on the economy and finance, on beliefs and attitudes? The answers reflect different historically specific understandings of a situation, both the type of society as well as their social status. Moreover, in the pre-modern/pre-scientific world, moral and religious responses were as important as practical responses. Did rulers and elites, or farmers and producers, implement policies that would mitigate risk and absorb future shocks? We suggest how some past societies, ranging from the later Roman period down to the early modern world, responded, consciously or less so, to transformative and unpredictable environmental pressures. One common thread of these historical examples is a tendency of system recoveries to focus on elite-level actors, rather than all levels of society that were more numerous. However, as some of these cases demonstrate, a more just and equitable resiliency can lead to longer-term stability for the state and its institutions.",

These three conditions do not exist in isolation, but combine and recombine in innumerable historical configurations. Historians must reduce this to ideal\u2013typical models, since it is practically impossible to analyze them all. Moreover, we must research particular historical case studies to illustrate these general patterns and to show how each case is subtly different from the next.",

In historical research, it has largely played a role in work on collapse and adaptation, where societies are understood as complex adaptive systems and in which ecological models have been influential. Since the basic structural dynamics of a societal system contribute to the types of collapse to which it may be subject, approaches to collapse, and resilience that unites structure and process are the best way forward in applying historical examples to contemporary planning initiatives with respect to environmental problems. This is a helpful approach, especially when allowances are made for individual human agency and belief systems (Cumming and Petersen 2017; Haldon 2020, building on ecological theory and formal resilience theory; also Anderies 2006; Berkes and Ross 2016; Gunderson and Holling 2002).",

The question of how to distribute the costs of resilience, and the degree to which this might be built into any system, varies across time and cultural milieu. In the following, we examine several cases in past societies where we can observe (1) both top-down and bottom-up responses to significant environmental challenges, how different sectors of society responded or reacted, and where we can detect positive as well as negative outcomes; (2) the differential costs of resilience when states are faced with substantial economic and political challenges; and (3) state- and society-level responses to pandemics and both planned and unintended consequences.",

The Western half had divided into successor \u201cbarbarian\u201d kingdoms, while the Eastern Roman Empire was centered around the Balkans, Anatolia (mod. Turkey), and the Middle East. One of its main initiatives, the re-conquest of formerly Roman regions in the west, such as North Africa and Italy, had begun well\u2014with quick and cheap conquests. At the height of this re-conquest in the early 540 s, the Justinianic Plague erupted across the Mediterreanean world and Europe. The Justinianic Plague was a pandemic of the bacterium Yersinia pestis that remained active for over two centuries, c. 541\u2013750 C.E. Its impact on the Eurasian population has been suggested as significant (i.e., causing the deaths of tens of millions), while its effects on human behavior from economics to culture and religion have also been described as pivotal (Meier 2016; Harper 2017; Sarris 2006). Some have described it as the watershed moment separating a flourishing Ancient World from the darker Medieval World. While this master narrative is deeply problematic and has been challenged in recent years, individual outbreaks\u2014the local impact of the plague during that two-century framework\u2014have been entirely ignored (Mordechai and Eisenberg 2019; Mordechai et al. 2019). The problematic \u2018catastrophe\u2019 narrative is simply copied and pasted across all of its outbreaks (Sarris 2002, 2011).",

            "text": "Yet if we examine particular outbreaks, even the destructive demographic narrative demonstrates the ability of the Eastern Roman state to react both immediately to the increased numbers of deaths, maintain vital administrative efforts, and continue its long-term political goals. The contemporary writers Procopius of Caesarea and John of Ephesus recorded intricate details about the first outbreak in the city of Constantinople in 542 C.E. The number of deaths was significant, especially given the city\u2019s urban density, but hard numbers or even percentages are completely uncertain. Procopius wrote that the outbreak lasted for three particularly virulent months and claimed that 5000 and then 10,000 people died per day. Using these numbers, the number of deaths would have reached 675,000 by the end of the three months, while the population of Constantinople was perhaps around 500,000, so these numbers are impossible (Procopius, Wars1914, II. xxii\u2013xxxiii). John of Ephesus included even higher numbers, up to 16,000 deaths per day (John of Ephesus). Some modern scholars have suggested that 20% of the city\u2019s population died and more recently that 50% died, although these percentages are conjectures based on dubious assumptions (Bratton 1981; Stathakopoulos 2004; Harper 2017). Recent attempts to use epidemiological modeling could not resolve this problematic question (White and Mordechai 2020).",

Sometimes this attempt backfired, since entire houses would perish from plague and the dead would remain unburied for days (Procopius, Wars1914, II. xxii\u2013xxxiii). During later outbreaks of plague in Constantinople, elites, including the emperor himself, fled to nearby urban centers, while in other cases an entire city fled the arrival of the plague, decamping into the mountains (Theophanes Confessor, Chronographia, AM 6053; Paul the Deacon, History of the Lombards1878, 4.14). In total, Romans understood that the plague was an unexpected new phenomenon and adapted accordingly by trying to mitigate its spread. These lessons of how to prevent the spread of plague also suggest that people around the Mediterranean world not only tolerated disruptions to their socio-economic activity, but even embraced them in some cases\u2014preferring flight over simple isolation.

The imperial administration and the emperor Justinian (r. 527\u2013565), who took a personal hand in directing the response, recognized the overwhelming burial problem and responded quickly by appointing an administrator named Theodorus to solve it. Theodorus received money to hire people to help bury the poorer members of society, whose families could not afford or arrange for their burial. Initially, they were placed in existing cemeteries, but as these filled up, Theodorus\u2019 task force dug new larger trenches and pits to place the large numbers of bodies, a scene reminiscent of current day burials. Theodorus, and by extension the state itself, could clearly adapt to different burial requirements both culturally and logistically as the situation required it. Unlike in many cases today, the various political factions stopped their fighting and helped provide the manpower for Theodorus to meet his grim new task (Procopius). Despite the significant mortality, these burial measures resolved the most pressing issue for Constantinople: removing dead bodies to ensure other infections did not spread.",

In the first few years after the outbreak in 542, the grain shipments from Egypt appear to have been reduced due to some combination of a smaller population that required less food and the disruption of trade routes due to the pandemic. Yet within five years the grain shipments had returned to their original quantity demonstrating that the state had bounced back and was able to provide resources as it had before the outbreak (Zuckerman 2004).",

For instance, procurement of grain in Egypt was likely a highly planned and regulated practice that had been operating for almost six centuries. Both the government in Constantinople and local officials in Egypt prioritized grain procurement as a core systemic function. The grain shipments had significant built-in redundancies that would guarantee that enough grain reached Constantinople despite unexpected (but known and relatively common) dangers such as shipwrecks, spoiled food, and unfavorable sailing weather slowing shipments. Administrators often had significant experience in their positions adapting to these known problems and likely passed much of this to their replacements. This approach allowed the system to mitigate disruptions such as the outbreak of plague. However, major political disruptions such as the conquest of Egypt by the Persians several decades later had a far more significant result\u2014the abrupt ending of all shipments from Egypt\u2014which forced the government to scramble to search for new grain-supplying regions (Haldon 2016).",

The outbreak did not change long-term political goals, the state\u2019s ability to fight wars, or raise taxes, and move resources around, and unlike other examples in this paper, there was no discernible change in power structures and elite\u2013lower class labor relations.

In short, it is said to have challenged existing landlord-tenant relationships and the whole basis of serfdom (the legal binding of peasants to the lands of elites). Yet in England serfdom was already declining by the time of the Black Death (Hilton 1985, pp. 55\u201358; Campbell 2005). Moreover, landlords can respond to labor shortages in various ways\u2014in eastern Europe, for example, they increasingly tied labor to the land and imposed a more oppressive serfdom on the peasantry. From the later twelfth century on, reflecting elite demand in respect of consumption and increased expenditures, and backed by royal legislation, landlords in England demanded heavier labor services, reducing peasant holdings and thus the ability of the serfs to do anything more than maintain a bare subsistence.",

Yet a trend toward labor shortages and demographic changes had set in well before this, following the so-called Great Famine (1315\u20131317). In this context, the Black Death was less a prime cause than a further exacerbating and intensifying factor (Britnell 2004, pp. 368\u2013387; Cohn 2007; Whittle 2007; Postan 1973; Hilton 1973/2003, 1975). The Black Death and the accompanying increased pace of demographic contraction did not in themselves, therefore, lead either to the end or to an intensification of servile relationships. Rather, a number of regionally nuanced factors played a role, among which one of the most important was the degree of class difference. As wealthier peasants resisted labor services, the poorer members of their communities could be employed\u2014and exploited\u2014as wage earners. Indeed, one answer to the lords\u2019 demands for greater cash liquidity was the leasing of their estate land to wealthier peasant tenants. Where this occurred the demand for wage-labor among the lessees of lords\u2019 estate lands rose, thus stimulating a clearer rural social hierarchy (Britnell 2004, pp. 429\u2013450, esp. 432\u2013433).

A key factor in the empire\u2019s resilience was thus its size. It developed systems to mobilize crucial resources from distant locations to provision its cities and military and to balance regional surpluses and deficits, including food, labor, timber, and strategic materials (e.g., gunpowder). The security provided by Ottoman soldiers as well as legal and tax provisions encouraged the expansion of agriculture and the containment of mobile pastoralism. The empire seemed resilient to socio-environmental stress: when tested by a series of local droughts, shortages and famines during the 1560s\u20131580s, Ottoman officials were able to contain the damage by shifting tax burdens from the affected areas, ordering fixed-price sales of grain from other provinces, and in some cases arranging direct shipments from local or imperial granaries (White 2011; Mikhail 2011; Agoston 2004).",

Lack of agricultural diversification in semi-arid regions, dependence on provinces near the imperial capital for extraordinary taxes and requisitions, lack of spare capacity in dealing with both simultaneous military and infrastructural emergencies, all stressed the system to capacity. These factors combined with difficulties of supplying and pacifying inland regions, poor overland communications and the interaction of famine, flight, insecurity, and disease. Together with inadequate public health systems that might mitigate epidemic disease impacts, the result was a severe and sustained population loss leading to an unstable balance between village agriculture and mobile pastoralism\u2014and ultimately a fracturing of state management and control over provincial economies.",

By the early tenth century, after two centuries of rebuilding following the shock of the early Islamic conquests, it was entering a period of expansion in both the Balkans and the Middle East. In parallel, there had evolved a social elite of office holders and landowners who gradually achieved a near monopoly on the senior and middling posts in the military and civil administration. It was their task to implement government policy in the provinces, but their increasing wealth and status meant that by the tenth century they were also a potential source of opposition to the central government. The tension between these two aspects of the East Roman state revealed itself in the efforts of the elite to expand its wealth in land, generally at the expense of village communities who were a key element in the state's finances and provided the core of the provincial armies, thus jeopardizing the effectiveness of the central state administration itself.",

The history of the eastern regions of the later Roman Empire in the fifth-seventh centuries CE offers a good example of how one sector within a social system lost even as society as a whole benefitted. Between 470 CE and lasting until ca. 670/720 CE (Izdebski et al. 2016), climate change led to increased winter precipitation that enabled a profound transformation in late antique society. The increased winter rainfall, crucial for cereal cultivation in most of the Eastern Mediterranean, shifted the ecological frontier between arid areas and the land suitable for cereal cultivation. Although the introduction of farming on these marginal lands often required sophisticated irrigation and water-harvesting techniques (in the Negev desert, for example), the changing climate permitted an extension of agricultural production into regions previously left uncultivated or used only as pastures. Eastern Roman society was remarkably efficient at turning the environmental challenge of increased precipitation into an economic opportunity, and several regions saw an unprecedented expansion of agriculture and rural settlement (Izdebski et al. 2016). This increase in agricultural production in turn encouraged contemporaries to specialize in cash crops, such as olives and vine, visible in a number of micro-regions across the Eastern Mediterranean (see for instance England et al. 2008; Varinlio\u011flu 2011; Izdebski 2013a, b).",

Although the dramatic expansion into marginal lands occurred on the fringes of urbanized regions, new settlements encroached on lands that were located beyond the traditional hinterlands of existing urban communities, and escaped their political and economic control (e.g., Niew\u00f6hner 2006). This inaugurated a decline in the political and cultural role of many cities, contributing to an ongoing transformation of economic relationships between town and country, and elites and the producing population (Brandes and Haldon 2000).

While no modern public health infrastructure existed, the imperial government readjusted quickly to meet two immediate needs: burial of the dead and the provision of food supplies for the population. By fulfilling these two duties and when combined with individual self-isolation, Constantinople sustained itself and rebounded within just a few years. Flexibility built into the imperial administration provided the empire with the capacity to manage a number of (expected) short-term problems, from lower crop yields to catastrophic weather, that allowed the state to mitigate sudden changes to market supply. These short-term strategies secured the stability to meet the state\u2019s longer-term strategic aims such as the re-conquest of Italy, as well as continuity of administration and government.",

In the process, however, the state in the past also unconsciously transformed the relationships between the central power and central and regional elites. The great famine in the Eastern Roman empire that followed the severe winter of 927/928 CE tells exactly this story. This case, along with the example of the catastrophic droughts suffered by the Ottomans in the 1590s CE, illustrates how a central government damaged its own economic base when the largest social group, the lower strata of the society, lost its resilience to environmental stress. Their vulnerability undermined the foundations of the state\u2019s fiscal economy: lack of resilience on the part of the less privileged directly impacted the resources available to the state through taxes and requisitions, thus weakening the core functions of the central government, including the military.",

            "text": "A third conclusion is, therefore, that the greater the degree of baseline inequality at the outset of a crisis, the less resilience there is in the system as a whole, the more uneven the distribution of the resilience burden, and the greater the potential for post-solution breakdown of a given social order. Social elites, as identifiable groups, generally survive societal crises and transformations because they have a vested interest in preserving their position and generally retain the resources to do so. While individual members or sectors of elites may die or lose their positions of wealth and power, as a visible societal group, they are often still around and at the top of the heap when the dust settles. Naturally, there are exceptions: rapid revolutionary events such as in France between 1789 and 1794 or Russia in 1917\u20131918 can result in the effective removal of much of an established super-elite even if individual members of the old establishment changed sides and joined the revolution. But it is not uncommon, even where a major shift in political and ideological control takes place, for substantial elements of an established elite to adapt to radically changed circumstances and retain their basic socio-economic advantage, even where they are no longer the ruling element. This occurred, for example, with the middling elite of Sasanian Iran after the Islamic conquest in the 640s\u2013650s (Pourshariati 2008; Morony 1984); it was true of the middling elites of the Western Roman Empire (Halsall 2007); it was true of local Balkan elites after the Ottoman conquests in the fourteenth\u2013fifteenth centuries CE (Kunt 1983; Inalc\u0131k 1973); it was just as true of traditional elites throughout the Middle East, Iran and as far as Afghanistan after Alexander\u2019s conquests in the fourth century BCE (Adams 2006; Erskine 2008).",

But sectorally, as in the case of central governments with the means at their disposal, the answer varied: the degree of the problems they faced, the nature of economic and social class relationships, and, to some extent, the overall ideology and its key motifs were central factors. Did people understand the challenges and respond appropriately? Here we have to say, it depends: representatives of religions tended to have a more global outlook (i.e., for people of the same faith), but their responses tended to be moral rather than practical (i.e., prayers to stop the calamity), and when they were practical they were inevitably local and short-term (i.e., famine relief, for example). Ruling elites could respond, but they tended to react primarily to perceived threats to their own survival. This might well embrace the entire state, but as we have seen in some of the examples above, such responses were generally compromised by elite interests, as in the tenth century medieval Eastern Roman empire. Furthermore, they usually were able to respond only to the immediately perceived problem\u2014which may have been just a symptom of deeper issues. And were they able to implement policies to mitigate future risk? Yes, but again, for example in the case of Antioch, often with unforeseen consequences for the longer term.",
