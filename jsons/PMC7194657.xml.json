            "text": "Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) primarily causes an acute respiratory disease in domestic chickens. The disease is characterized by high morbidity, low mortality, and substantial loss of production (Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008). The etiologic agent of infectious bronchitis (IB) is an enveloped, positive-sense, and single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the family Coronaviridae, genus Coronavirus (Cavanagh, 2007). Chickens of all ages may be infected, and infected chickens show signs of depression, coughing, sneezing, nasal discharge, polyuria, and death. The IBV replicates in many organs such as the upper respiratory tract, reproductive, renal, and digestive organs, and lead to inflammatory responses (Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008). Live attenuated and inactivated vaccines have been developed to control IB (Cavanagh, 2007). Despite the wide use of various vaccines to protect commercial chickens in Iran, IB still remains responsible for serious financial losses to the poultry industry of the country. A new isolate of IBV (IRFIBV32; GenBank: HQ123359.1) from broiler chicken in Fars province, Southern Iran, was isolated and identified by Boroomand et al. (2011). Furthermore, the pathogenesis and clinical signs of experimentally infected chicks by this isolate were also studied (Boroomand et al., 2012).",

The purposes of these events are to eliminate the infecting agent, prevent further tissue damage, and restore the homeostasis of the host organism. The early sets of reactions that occur immediately after tissue damage are known as the acute phase response (APR). Acute phase response includes pro-inflammatory cytokines and acute phase protein (APP) production (Petersen et al., 2004). The APP are blood proteins primarily synthesized by the liver, in which the concentration of APP change to infection, inflammation, surgical trauma, or stress (Gabay and Kushner, 1999; Eckersall, 2004; Murata et al., 2004; Gruys et al., 2005). Many advances in monitoring the APP response in animals for clinical and experimental purposes have been achieved in the last 2 decades (Eckersall, 2000).",

Two major pro-inflammatory cytokines are tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), which activate macrophages and promote cell-mediated immune responses against invasive intracellular pathogens (Rich et al., 2008).",

Several research studies have been published about APP and their changes due to different inflammatory and noninflammatory conditions in birds (Nielsen et al., 1999; Henry et al., 2000; Barnes et al., 2001; Koutsos and Klasing, 2001; Juul-Madsen et al., 2003; Kokosharov, 2006). However, the importance of and sensitivity toward the evaluation of APP and inflammatory cytokines in the diagnosis of infection and disease are not clearly known. Few research studies have been undertaken on changes of APP and sialic acid (SA) in IB with regard to finding the relationship between APP and sialic acid in IB. Based on this evidence, the present study was undertaken to evaluate alteration in concentrations of the acute phase proteins [haptoglobin (Hp) and serum amyloid A (SAA)], pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3), and the serum level of total sialic acid (TSA), lipid-bound sialic acid (LBSA), and protein-bound sialic acid (PBSA) in experimentally infected chicks by IBV isolate IRFIBV32 compared with healthy chicks.",

It was propagated in 10-d-old embryonating chicken eggs. The embryo lethal dose (ELD50) was calculated according to the formula of Reed and Muench (1938). Allantoic fluid containing 105 ELD50/0.1 mL of the virus was used to induce disease. The infected group was challenged intranasally at 20 d old. The remaining 20 birds were left as unchallenged control. Blood sampling was performed on all chicks via wing vein. All samples were collected prior to and 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 15, and 20 d postinoculation (PI) into plane tubes. Sera were separated by centrifugation (for 15 min at 750 \u00d7 g and 25\u00b0C) and stored at \u221220\u00b0C until assayed. A TaqMan real-time reverse-transcription PCR was used for early and accurate detection and quantify the viral RNA load of IBV isolate IRFIBV32 from infected chicken clinical samples at 1, 7, and 11 d PI. The cDNA synthesis from normalized RNA of positive samples was carried out using AccuPowder RT PreMix kit (BioNeer Corporation, Daejeon, South Korea) according to the manufacturer's suggestions. The reaction was performed with a mixture of 20 pmol of random hexamer and 20 pmol of reverse primer. The primer was specific to a highly conserved region of nucleocapsid protein gene of IBV that was described previously by Adzhar et al. (1996; Table 1\n). The reaction mixture was incubated at 70\u00b0C for 5 min, then incubated at 42\u00b0C for 60 min, heated to 95\u00b0C for 5 min, cooled to 4\u00b0C, then stored at \u221270\u00b0C until assayed. The quantitative real-time PCR primers and TaqMan probe used in this study were described previously by Chousalkar et al. (2009; Table 1). The primers amplified a 76-bp fragment in the N gene of IBV. The probe annealed to the part of the sequence amplified by 2 primers (Chousalkar et al., 2009). The assays were performed on a 48-well microtiter plate of Bio-Rad MiniOpticon System. The reaction mixture contained 5 \u00b5L of target cDNA, 1 \u00b5L of each primer at a concentration of 10 pmol/\u00b5L, 1 \u00b5L of the TaqMan probe at a concentration of 10 pmol/\u00b5L, 10 \u00b5L of master mix 5x, 0.2 \u00b5L of uracil-N-glycosylase (UNG), and 1.8 \u00b5L of distilled water in a final volume of 20 \u00b5L. At first UNG treatment at 50\u00b0C for 2 min and UNG inactivation at 95\u00b0C for 10 min was performed and then cDNA was amplified by 44 two-step cycles: denaturation (95\u00b0C, 15 s), primer annealing (55\u00b0C, 30 s). Viral cDNA copy numbers (expressed as copies per 1 \u00b5g of total RNA) were quantified by comparison with a 10-fold serially diluted plasmid standard of known concentration. The data and standard curves were obtained during target cDNA and recombinant plasmid amplification (unpublished data).",

Serum amyloid A is an apolipoprotein of high-density lipoprotein. Serum amyloid A is one of the major acute phase proteins in which, following inflammation and physical stress or at parturition, the serum SAA levels elevate (Murata et al., 2004). Serum amyloid A and Hp have the most important change to inflammation among APP in many animal species (Pi\u00f1eiro et al., 2007). In chickens, SAA is likely to be a reliable APP for diagnosing inflammatory lesions (Chamanza et al., 1999). As already mentioned, the concentrations of SAA and Hp were significantly higher in challenged chicks after IBV inoculation (P < 0.05, Figure 1). These results are consistent with the previous studies. Kov\u00e1cs et al. (2007) showed an increase in SAA concentration in goose following administration of a fowl cholera vaccine containing inactivated Pasteurella multocida. Nazifi et al. (2010) assessed a significant increase in SAA and Hp levels in infected chicks with gumboro. Nazifi et al. (2011) reported a significant increase of SAA and Hp levels in chicks that had been infected naturally with IBV. In the study of Mosleh et al. (2012), Japanese quail with retained yolk sac showed a significant increase in Hp and SAA concentration. It is documented that SAA and transferrin concentrations increase following administration of terpentin to pullet and Staphylococcus aureus infection in chicks (Chamanza et al., 1999).",

The TNF-\u03b1 is a cytokine involved in systemic inflammation and is a member of a group of cytokines that stimulate the APR. The TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 are responsible for a broad spectrum of synergistic or antagonistic effects that influence the specific immune response of the stressed organism against foreign antigens and invading microorganisms (van Miert, 1995; Pinelli, 1996). In the present experiment, the results of the IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 assay showed that the serum concentrations of these inflammatory cytokines in the infected group were significantly higher than in the control group after virus inoculation (P < 0.05; Figure 2). Inflammatory reaction in infected chicks following IBV inoculation causes the release and elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations. These pro-inflammatory cytokines then induce the synthesis of APP by the liver. Therefore, the elevation in the IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, SAA, and Hp concentration in the present experiment could be explained. Arnold and Holt (1996) reported that the level of the tumor necrosis factor in the intestinal tract of infected birds with Salmonella enteritis was higher than healthy ones. Nang et al. (2011) determined infection of chickens with H9N2 influenza virus may induce the production of TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3 in trachea, lung, and intestinal cells. Liu et al. (2010) showed that infection with infectious bursal disease virus induces changes in the level of cytokine gene expression in the chicken bursa.",

Sialic acid is a terminal component of the nonreducing end of carbohydrate chains of glycoproteins and glycolipids (Seyrek et al., 2008). The concentration of SA increases rapidly following the inflammatory and injury process. The measurement of serum SA concentration is of importance in the diagnosis and prognosis of inflammation and cancer (Citil et al., 2004). Based on our findings, concentrations of TSA, LBSA, and PBSA in infected birds significantly increased compared with healthy ones (P < 0.05; Figure 3). Increasing serum TSA, LBSA, and PBSA concentrations revealed apparent tissue damage and inflammatory disorders. This is supported by increases of other measured parameters (Hp, SAA, TNF-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3) in the present research. This result is in good agreement with the study of Nazifi et al. (2011), which reported that the concentrations of TSA, LBSA, and PBSA in chicks infected naturally with IBV were higher than control group. The TSA, LBSA, and PBSA concentrations in cattle with traumatic reticulo-peritonitis were higher than those of healthy cattle (Citil et al., 2004). Mosleh et al. (2012) demonstrated a significant increase in TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, TSA, LBSA, and PBSA concentrations in Japanese quail with retained yolk sac.",
