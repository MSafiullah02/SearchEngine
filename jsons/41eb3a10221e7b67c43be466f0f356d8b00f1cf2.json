Mortality reaches up to 50 % in the calves who have a ZST score less than 10 IU/l (MCEWAN et al., 1970) . When the value of the ZST test is between 10 and 20 IU/l, mortality varies from 7 to 25 %. CALDOW et al. (1988) concluded that where the incidence of disease is low, the importance of passive immunity is reduced. Therefore improved management can at least partly overcome the effect of low circulating IgG concentrations in calves. In the present study, the calves were hypogammaglobulinemic and were infected at the first day of life with a lethal dose of pathogens (10 10 E. coli). The administration of bovine plasma powder induced a good protection against clinical symptoms and mortality in those hypogammaglobulinemic calves. In the experiment with the F17 + strain protection against septicaemia was also obtained, although the amount of circulating antibodies, as determined by the zinc sulphate turbidity test, was not raised by the administration of plasma powder. The low circulating gammaglobulin concentrations, and the absence of specific antibodies in the plasma are indicative for the fact that the protection offered to the calves by the plasma powder is probably due to the non-immunoglobulin fractions of the plasma powder.",

They showed an inhibition of adhesion of E. coli cells expressing F5 + or F17 + fimbriae by several glycoproteins found in bovine plasma. VAN DRIESSCHE (1988) also proved that oxidation of the monosaccharides of the villar glycoconjugates with sodium metaperiodate, a reagent which cleaves the C-C bond between vicinal hydroxyl groups of sugars, completely prevented E. coli F17 + from binding to the villi. This indicates that the carbohydrate part of the glycoconjugates is involved in the interaction with the lectins.

When these authors measured the adhesion of the bacteria in the small intestine, they found a significant reduction in adhesion of two orders of magnitude in the treated group. However, these investigators used partly purified glycoprotein glycans derived from plasma instead of a dried whole plasma preparation and reported that whole plasma was without effect. In our trial we found in the F5 + infected groups a reduction in excretion of the challenge strain in the faeces by 2-4 orders of magnitude when supplemented with bovine plasma powder at a high dose (25 g/l) and by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude when supplemented with bovine plasma powder at a low dose (10 g/l). As far as the swine plasma powder is concerned SANCHEZ et al. (unpublished results) also found an inhibition of adhesion of E. coli F5 + or F17 + strains in vitro by using swine plasma powder. However, this inhibition by swine plasma powder was less pronounced when compared to bovine plasma powder. In our in vivo experiments, the administration of swine plasma powder to calves infected with E. coli F5 + strain had no protective effect. One possible explanation could be a difference in glycoprotein composition in the plasma between pigs and cattle, although we could not find any information in the literature comparing the composition of plasma glycoproteins in different species.",

This was in contrast with the excretion of the E. coli F5 + strain. This excretion was no longer detectable (\u00b3 10 2 bacteria/g faeces) at 6-20 days after infection in the groups treated with bovine plasma powder. The excretion of the E. coli F17 + strain in the faeces of older calves might be the result of a colonization of the colon which is not inhibited by the plasma components, whereas the E. coli F5 + strain is more consonant with a colonization of the small intestine. At this age, the F17 + strain probably behaves like a commensal and is no longer harmful for the carrier.",

These analogues are simple to use (oral as feed additive), their inhibitory power is not lost upon digestion (the calf intestine appears to have only weak oligosaccharidase activity) and they are derived from a cheap raw material (blood plasma). The efficiency could be explained by the fact that several glycoprotein glycans in bovine plasma are recognized by the F5 + and F17 + fimbriae. One of the major drawbacks of supplementing bovine plasma powder in calves is the possible transmission of pathogenic agents. Although a maximum of control procedures are being implemented in order to guarantee a relative safe product, the fear of transmitting BSE prions remains a major concern. At present there is no indication that an infection can be transmitted by plasma products, but on the other hand there are no quick and reliable procedures to detect the presence of BSE prions in the plasma products. Further research is necessary to find prion detection methods and/or to develop efficient procedures to inactivate the prion in plasma products.",
