Posteroanterior ( Fig. 2A) and lateral (Fig. 2B) projections of the chest X-Ray of a thirty-seven-year-old female colleague, who presented with cough and fever. Chest X-Ray did not demonstrate any lung abnormalities. Chest CT executed just after the X-Ray, showed an area of crazy paving in the left posterior costophrenic recess (Fig. 2B) ; patchy GGOs are also bilaterally recognizable ( Fig. 2B and C) . 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60  61  62  63  64 Therefore, we can consider chest X-Ray as a first-line tool to assess the presence of lung abnormalities in symptomatic patients, suspected for COVID-19 infection. In our Emergency Department, screening imaging examinations were not performed, we executed chest X-Rays only in patients with suspected symptoms.",

In patients affected by COVID-19 pneumonia, pure GGOs and GGOs with reticular or interlobular septal thickening (resulting in the crazy paving pattern) seem to be the most common findings, whereas pure consolidation is less common. 9 Our CT findings are in line with those previously reported in other CT studies on COVID-19 patients. 4, 6, 9, 12, 13 3/4 (75%) showed a unilateral distribution of the lesions; 4/4 (100%), a peripheral distribution of lung abnormalities; 4/4 (100%), a location in the posterior part; 4/4 (100%) showed (Fig. 3B) projections of the chest X-Ray of a thirty-three-year-old nurse, who presented with cough and fever. Chest X-Ray was reported as negative; at a review, a slight thickening of the bronchovascular bundles could be observed at the lower right field. Chest CT executed just after the X-Ray, showed an extensive consolidation, with a peripheral posterior location in the right lower lobe, and some patchy GGOs with lateral peripheral distribution (Fig. 3C ). 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60  61  62  63  64 lower zones involvement. The peripheral distribution, the involvement of posterior and lower lung zones are considered typical CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia; even if bilateral affection is more frequent, unilateral pneumonia has also been reported 1e7,9,12e15 Due to the high rate of GGOs, findings can be missed on X-Rays, 14 but also confirmed positive patients can show negative chest CT. 15 In our case series, 3/4 patients (75%) were healthcare workers, therefore considered high-risk subjects. A previous study observed that nearly 4% of the confirmed COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China, were in healthcare workers, 16 suggesting the hospitals as a potential location of transmission even among workers who are trained to protect themselves from potential contagions. 17 In conclusion, in positive COVID-19 patients, chest X-Rays could be falsely negative. The presence of suspected symptoms in epidemic areas should alert the Clinicians to this possibility.",
