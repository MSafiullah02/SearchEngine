Ubiquitin (Ub)-mediated degradation is conserved widely across eukaryotic kingdoms including yeast, plants, and mammals, and involves the covalent addition of poly-Ub chains to the target protein in a cascade of enzymatic reactions (Glickman and Ciechanover, 2002). These reactions lead ultimately to the covalent conjugation of Ub to the target protein via an isopeptide bond between the C-terminus of Ub and the \u025b-amino group of one or more lysine residues of the target protein. Stepwise conjugation of additional Ub moieties to the first Ub molecule then generates the poly-Ub chains that are essential for recognition and subsequent degradation of the target protein by the proteasome (Thrower et al, 2000).",

The removal of Ub is catalysed by proteases generically named deubiquitylating (DUB) enzymes, most of which are cysteine proteinases (Nijman et al, 2005; Sulea et al, 2006). Some of these enzymes catalyse the hydrolysis of peptide bonds, releasing Ub from its precursor forms. Most importantly, DUBs also cleave isopeptide bonds within poly-Ub chains or between the C-terminal glycine of the proximal Ub and the target protein, eventually leading to reversal of Ub signalling or to protein stabilization (Komander et al, 2009; Reyes-Turcu et al, 2009).",

The UPS is utilized not only by host cells in immunity and biotic stress responses, but can also be manipulated and subverted by pathogens\u2014including viruses\u2014for their own use (Shackelford and Pagano, 2005; Citovsky et al, 2009; Isaacson and Ploegh, 2009; Randow and Lehner, 2009). Viruses are known to target Ub and Ub-like modifier pathways using various strategies, including the recruitment of host ubiquitin ligases or DUB enzymes (Querido et al, 2001; Yu et al, 2003; Yokota et al, 2008). Interestingly, viruses also encode ubiquitin ligases (Boutell et al, 2002) and DUBs (Balakirev et al, 2002; Kattenhorn et al, 2005). Although new insights into their biochemical activities and molecular structures have been gained in recent years (Sulea et al, 2006; Schlieker et al, 2007; James et al, 2011), a major challenge in this field is now to define and understand substrate specificity, as well as the physiological roles played by these modulators of the Ub pathway during the infection cycle.",

To determine whether expression of 98K affects cellular global Ub-conjugate levels, Arabidopsis cells were transfected with p\u03a9-myc2\u2013Ub\u2014a plasmid expressing a myc-tagged version of ubiquitin (Camborde et al, 2010)\u2014together with the expression vectors p\u03a9-98K or p\u03a9-98K-C783S encoding WT or catalytically inactive 98K, respectively. As a positive control, we expressed in Arabidopsis cells the HA-tagged CCHFV OTU domain, reported previously to display a global DUB activity in human cells (Frias-Staheli et al, 2007). Levels of total ubiquitylated proteins were then compared by subjecting protein extracts with immunoblot analysis with anti-myc antibodies. As shown in Figure 6A, whereas expression of CCHFV OTU led to the almost complete disappearance of the signal corresponding to Ub conjugates (lane 3), the levels and overall distribution of Ub conjugates were not affected by expression of the TYMV-encoded 98K protein (lanes 4, 5), highlighting the striking difference between TYMV PRO and CCHFV OTU domains in terms of specificity, despite their putative structural relationship. This result demonstrates that 98K does not have a global DUB activity, and instead suggests that it is likely to target specific molecules.",

The metabolic stability of 66K was estimated from the amount of labelled 66K remaining, corrected for the amount of protein present in the immunoprecipitates.

In this system, a test protein is produced as a translational fusion to a stable reference protein separated by a Ub monomer. Such fusions are cleaved rapidly and precisely at the C-terminus of Ub by cellular Ub-specific processing proteases, yielding equimolar amounts of the test and reference proteins (Figure 8A). We previously reported the metabolic stability of 66K can be determined by transfecting cells with the expression vector p\u03a9-CAT:66K-LUC in which chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) serves as the internal control, and luciferase (LUC)\u2014N-terminally fused to the 66K protein\u2014serves as the test protein, with the LUC/CAT activity ratio reflecting the instability of the test protein (Camborde et al, 2010).

Interestingly, this effect was partially reversed upon mutation of the catalytic C783 residue, as expression of the 98K-C783S or 98K-C783A mutants was found to affect 66K stability to a lesser extent than the wt 98K, as determined by comparison of samples expressing identical levels of wt or mutated 98K (P=0.0001) (Figure 8C).",

Previous characterization of 206K processing has identified two cleavage sites, at the PRO/HEL and HEL/POL junctions (Figure 9A; Kadar\u00e9 et al, 1995; Bransom et al, 1996; Jakubiec et al, 2007). Introducing the C783S mutation into the E17 transcripts corresponding to the full-length copy of the TYMV genome abolishes viral infectivity completely (Jakubiec et al, 2007). However, this effect was attributed to the fact that cleavage at the HEL/POL junction is absolutely required for TYMV infectivity, as shown by mutagenesis studies affecting the HEL/POL cleavage site (Jakubiec et al, 2007).",

Within this context, the C783S mutation was then introduced into the PRO domain to generate the plasmid E17-stop\u0394-(A/S2)-C783S. It should be emphasized that both transcripts deriving from the latter two constructs allow expression of the same set of proteins (i.e., the uncleavable form of the 140K protein), and that the C783S mutation is now expected to have no effect on processing of the viral replication proteins. We, therefore, reasoned that a decreased efficiency of complementation would reflect a defect in viral infectivity due to the lack of DUB activity. The abilities of the corresponding transcripts to be trans-complemented by p\u03a9-66K were thus assessed by assaying the accumulation of viral CP and viral RNAs by western and northern blots, respectively.",

Interestingly, we observed that co-expression of 98K led to a decrease in the amount of 66K poly-Ub conjugates present in plant cells (Figure 6B), and to a subsequent increase in 66K metabolic stability (Figures 7 and 8). As both features were affected by the C783S mutation shown to abolish DUB activity, we conclude that the 98K DUB activity indeed has the ability to interfere with the 66K RdRp polyubiquitylation process, and contributes to regulating its degradation. This effect is independent of the phosphorylation status of 66K\u2014reported previously to influence 66K stability slightly (Jakubiec et al, 2006; Camborde et al, 2010), as 66K phosphorylation appeared not to be affected by the co-expression of 98K protein (Supplementary Figure S2).",

In particular, as 98K was shown to be a membrane-associated protein that recruits 66K to the chloroplast envelope vesicles where TYMV replication takes place (Prod'homme et al, 2001, 2003), 98K-dependent recruitment to membranes and subsequent compartmentalization might also help protect 66K from degradation.

            "text": "In that respect, it is interesting to note that, whereas treatment with proteasome inhibitors at late time points of viral infection were reported to improve viral infectivity (Camborde et al, 2010), proteasome inhibition in the early phase of viral life cycle was found to partially inhibit viral infection (LC and IJ, unpublished observations) suggesting that proteasome-dependent pathways are also required for some steps of TYMV replication. The spatial (compartment specific) or temporal degradation of the RdRp may thus constitute yet another regulatory mechanism, and we propose that the viral DUB plays a critical role in that process, offering a new way to finely tune viral RNA replication. The analysis of 66K ubiquitylation status in the early steps of viral infection may help clarify this point, but the low level of 66K produced has so far precluded such analyses.",
