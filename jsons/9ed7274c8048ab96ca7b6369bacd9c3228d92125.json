The platform ranks a number of clinical trial candidates listed in Table 1 of Harrison [9] in the top 1% of predictions and provides relevant target and off-target interaction information for them. We are currently in the process of undertaking in vitro validation of top ranked candidates as well as using EHR data to corroborate or negate predictions made by the platform. This pandemic highlights the importance of developing such robust shotgun repurposing platforms that not only make drug discovery more efficient by systematically evaluating multiple uses of a human ingestible drug but may also be rapidly deployed every time a new disease arises.",

The orange arrows in decreasing thickness indicate the interaction score (1st, 5th, or 10th percentile) between the drug and predicted protein target. In the case of prodrug remdesivir, conversion to its active form diminishes its predicted interaction with the protease and greatly strengthens it with the RdRP: The top predicted poses of the active form of remdesivir docked to the solved and template-based model structures of the RdRP (right) from both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 using CANDOCK[8] indicate binding directly into the catalytic site (colored blue). The site consists of two adjacent aspartic acid residues, indicating that remdesivir disrupts RdRP function when it binds and is potentially effective against at least two different coronaviruses. Other interesting predictions from our March 16, 2020 round (http://protinfo.compbio.buffalo.edu/cando/results/covid19/) include ACE inhibitors at rank 25-30, remdesivir at rank 54, and darunavir and other HIV protease inhibitors at rank 55-60. A separate pipeline within CANDO based on drug-drug similarity to known SARS-CoV actives identified chloroquine and other antimalarials at rank 36-41, which may be effective via a",

The platform screens and ranks every existing human use drug for every disease/indication through large scale modelling and analysis of interactions between comprehensive libraries of drugs/compounds and protein structures. The interaction may be determined by any screening or docking method but the built-in ones using a fast bioinformatic docking protocol and the hierarchical fragment-based docking with dynamics protocol CANDOCK[8] are prioritized. The drug-proteome signature comparison and ranking approach used by the CANDO platform yields benchmarking accuracies of 20-40% for ~1500 indications relative to random control accuracies of 2-15%. Across twelve prospective in vitro validation studies, 58/163 (35%) top ranking predictions made using the CANDO platform had comparable or better activity relative to existing drugs across ten indications, and represent potential novel repurposed therapies for indications such as dengue, dental",
