The smaller droplets are often invisible to the\nnaked eye. Past research has shown that most respiratory droplets do not travel\nindependently on their trajectories. Instead, droplets in a continuum of sizes are trapped\nand carried forward within a moist, warm, turbulent cloud of gas.1 In another study, it was shown that as people raise their\nvoice, they emit more droplets, but the size distribution of the droplets remains the\nsame.2 Furthermore, researchers have\nshown that even breathing could release potentially infectious aerosols.3 They have captured the large droplets\nproduced when sneezing and coughing as well as the aerosol droplets produced when sneezing,\ncoughing, breathing, and talking on different surfaces. Yan et al.3 showed that the flu virus exists even in the\ntiny droplets resulting from breathing or talking alone. Although the mechanisms of\ntransmission are still under debate, it is widely accepted that aerosol or respiratory\ndroplet transmission is the critical factor for the rapid spread and continued circulation\nof influenza A virus in humans.4",

This study shows 2 m is a safe approximate distance in the case where\nthere is no wind, i.e., at wind speed \u22480 km/h, at 20 \u00b0C, relative humidity of 50%, and a\nground surface temperature of 15 \u00b0C (Fig. 7). The\nground surface temperature (GST) of 15 \u00b0C is somehow arbitrary because, in winter/spring\nseason, the ground surface temperature is lower than the air temperature and the opposite\nin the summer/autumn season. Therefore, we considered GST =\nTair \u2212 5 \u00b0C. However, the 5 \u00b0C may vary\nfrom region to region and also depends on the soil properties. We aimed to approximate as\nmuch as possible a real situation in winter/spring seasons. Further investigation is\nrequired to quantify the effects of GST,35 as well as relative humidity and ambient air temperature.",
