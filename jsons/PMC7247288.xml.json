            "text": "Seroprevalence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) amongst women of reproductive age ranges from 40 to 65% in the developed world and can reach 100% in developing countries [1, 2]. CMV infection in pregnancy, in the setting of both primary infection and reinfection, can be potentially transmitted to the foetus and or neonate, resulting in congenital CMV (cCMV). The consequences of CMV range from asymptomatic viraemia to potentially life changing conditions which include mental retardation and congenital sensorineural hearing loss. Studies have implicated maternal demographics, socioeconomics and HIV status among the strongest determinants of the biased occurrence and vertical transmission of CMV [3\u20137]. Furthermore, maternal immune responses to CMV infection and/or reactivation actively modulate CMV related disease outcomes [8]. Thus, variation in genes that encode components of the immune system that are directly or indirectly involved in the pathogenesis of CMV have been implicated in CMV infection outcomes [9]. However, the genetic variants, like seroprevalences and the factors influencing CMV epidemiology are heterogenous among populations hence research findings are equivocal.",

TLRs act as pattern recognition receptors of non-methylated viral CpG-containing DNA which signals the presence of CMV infection [12]. TLR2 and TLR4 are cell surface receptors while TLR3, \u2212 7 and \u2212 9 are endosomal receptors [13, 14]. TLRs facilitate viral attachment and entry resulting in CMV-elicited signalling antiviral responses such as type 1 interferon activation of nuclear factor kappa \u03b2 (NF-k \u03b2) and pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression [12, 15]. Activation of the type 1 interferon producing cascade and production of cytokines form the major cellular antiviral mechanisms against CMV [16\u201318]. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TLR2, TLR4, TLR7 and TLR9 genes were inconclusively reported to be associated with CMV infection [19\u201323].",

Chemokines that trigger an immune cascade by signalling direct growth, development, maturation, activation and increased life-span of immune cells. In the case of CMV infection, chemokines signal: maturation of B-lymphocytes into plasma cells which produce anti-CMV antibodies, and activation of cytotoxic T cells for destruction of CMV infected cells [24, 25]. The differential response to CMV exposure with some but not all exposed individuals developing CMV-related diseases suggests a possible role of host genetic variation in immune response. A study by Sezgin et al. [26] showed that human interleukin-10 receptor variants potentially interfere with IL-10 binding and signal transduction influencing susceptibility to CMV retinitis. In a large Swiss HIV Cohort Study, the effect of IFNL3 TT/\u2212G substitution, the variant allele was associated with occurrence of CMV retinitis [27]. The same allele was also associated with susceptibility to CMV replication in transplant patients [28].",

SNPs may influence the rate and regulatory dynamics of gene transcription, stability of mRNA as well as production and biological activity of resultant protein. We therefore investigated possible association between CMV infection and SNPs in 19 genes which encode proteins that are or may be involved in the immune reaction cascade against CMV. The departure from HWE in polymorphic SNPs is due to their association with CMV infection mainly because the departure is being observed when cases and controls are separated but HWE is maintained when the two groups are combined. We report a significant association between each of; rs10499563, rs179008, rs1816702 and rs352139 SNPs and CMV DNA status.

Our findings could be due to none of the participants having any form or history of metabolic syndrome. Hence, we were unlikely to observe any significant associations. The observation that CMV positivity is significantly associated with low systolic blood pressure contrasts with previous findings which have shown increasing systolic blood pressure with CMV positivity [36, 37]. It is worth noting that the previous studies were carried out in non-pregnant adults, hence discrepancy in findings could be due to the well documented effects of pregnancy on fluctuations in blood pressure [38, 39] masking the effects of CMV infection.",

            "text": "The intronic SNP rs352139T > C in the TLR9 gene was also associated with CMV DNA status. Homozygous rs352139C/C individuals were at a significantly higher risk of being CMV+ compared to homozygous T/T carriers. The effect of the C allele on risk of CMV infection was also observed in the dominant and recessive models where the significance of the compound heterozygous (T/C) and homozygous (C/C) genotypes had a greater risk than the homozygous (C/C) alone, relative to the T/T genotype in both cases. The higher risk of CMV positivity in homozygous carriers of the C allele suggest that the polymorphism results in a less potent protein compared to the T allele. Since the polymorphism is intronic, it likely creates an alternative splicing site thus, affecting mRNA transcription and the final protein product. A less potent protein would have decreased ability to form dimers that are required to illicit an immune reaction. Individuals who are homozygous T/T have impaired immune responses against CMV infection, hence are more likely to experience CMV infection or reactivation. The HIV rapid progressor phenotype has been linked to homozygosity for rs352139T allele also due to reduced TRL9 potency [52].",

            "text": "Conflicting findings were reported reduced risk of cCMV associated with the rs352139T/T genotype among infants in Poland [53]. The conflicting effect of rs352139T variant have also been reported in bacterial infection studies in Indonesia and Mexico, perhaps due to ethnic differences [54, 55]. We suggest that rs352139 could be in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with a polymorphic regulatory region that controls TLR9 expression or serves as a functional region SNP. LD patterns differ with level of genetic diversity among different ethnic groups, hence the effects of one SNP may vary from one population to another. Minor allele frequencies for these SNPs which seem to affect CMV infection risk were compared to other populations. TLR2 rs4696480A and TLR4 rs1075993T alleles, respectively, have lower frequencies among Zimbabweans (0.31 and 0.20) and other African populations (0.37 and 0.21) when compared to European (0.52 and 0.77) and Asian (0.57 and 0.86) populations. On the other hand, TLR4 rs7856729T and TLR9 rs5743836G, respectively, are proportionally higher in Zimbabwean (0.38 and 0.36) and other Africans (0.33 and 0.42) when compared to European (0.13 and 0.13) and Asian (0.10 and 0.00) populations. These differences in the distribution of risk alleles of world populations, is likely to lead to differential responses upon exposures to infectious pathogens. Indeed, the adaptive immune responses to the \u03b2-coronaviruses, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, are that can cause fatal lower respiratory tract infections, are marshalled by T cells, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells, through among other processes, activate other downstream cytokine and chemokine cascades, such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-21 and TNF-\u03b2 [56]. The molecular patterns displayed by viruses are then sensed by different immune cellular pathogen recognition receptors, including toll-like receptors (TLR:2, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9) [57]. Whether this genetic heterogeneity among populations plays an active role in the differential prevalence of CMV is unclear and is an area of further research which should also consider the strong influence of environmental factors.",

We recommend that future studies consider evaluating the profiles of immune response genes and the polymorphisms in these genes on their possible effects in viral infections. With respect to CMV, we recommend a mother-infant longitudinal approach that will seek to factor in the effect of these immunogenetic profiles in congenital CMV and its possible sequelae.",
