            "text": "Inbreeding is typically detrimental to fitness. However, some animal populations are reported to inbreed without incurring inbreeding depression, ostensibly due to past \"purging\" of deleterious alleles. Challenging this is the position that purging can, at best, only adapt a population to a particular environment; novel selective regimes will always uncover additional inbreeding load. We consider this in a prominent test case: the eusocial naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber), one of the most inbred of all free-living mammals. We investigated factors affecting mortality in a population of naked mole-rats struck by a spontaneous, lethal coronavirus outbreak. In a multivariate model, inbreeding coefficient strongly predicted mortality, with closely inbred mole-rats (F \u2265 0.25) over 300% more likely to die than their outbred counterparts. We demonstrate that, contrary to common assertions, strong inbreeding depression is evident in this species. Our results suggest that loss of genetic diversity through inbreeding may render populations vulnerable to local extinction from emerging infectious diseases even when other inbreeding depression symptoms are absent.",

An early microsatellite study of wild colonies suggested that over 80% of all mating occurs between first-degree relatives (Reeve et al. 1990 )-an unprecedented level of inbreeding among vertebrates. The lack of inbreeding avoidance and the naked mole-rats' intense xenophobia (Lacey and Sherman 1991) have been described as \"mechanisms that apparently minimize the chance of ever outbreeding\" (Jarvis et al. 1994 ). More recently, however, some circumstantial evidence has emerged of some latent selection for outbreeding: O'Riain et al. (1996) and Braude (2000) demonstrated the existence of rare dispersal morphs, and Clarke and Faulkes (1999) and Ciszek (2000) demonstrated a weak mating preference for nonkin. However, in 25 years of intensive study no overt signs of inbreeding depression have been reported. This makes the naked mole-rat a particularly interesting case to test the hypothesis that novel selection regimes may uncover inbreeding depression.",

Husbandry details have been described previously by Jarvis (1991) . Colonies typically comprised a single breeding pair and up to 55 nonbreeding relatives of both sexes. In total, our sample comprised 365 animals in 10 complete colonies: 209 males and 159 females, including 11 and 10 breeders of either sex, respectively. Age and body mass were known for all animals (age: 5 to 273 months, mean 89.4 \u00b1 60.4 SD; mass: 11.9 to 83.2 g, mean 35.7 \u00b1 12.7 SD). Furthermore, for each individual, a single dam and sire could be identified with certainty, on the basis of their distinctive morphologies and behavioral profiles (Clarke and Faulkes 1998) . Based on these records, we constructed a pedigree for each individual (maximum length: five generations) and used it to estimate a coefficient of inbreeding (F) as per Wright (1922) . Our study violates a key assumption of Wright's approach, however: that pedigree founders are unrelated. Population genetic studies (Faulkes et al. 1990; Reeve et al. 1990 ) suggest that intracolony relatedness is typically very high in wild naked mole-rats. Thus, here we explicitly assumed that pedigree founders captured from the same exact locality (i.e., same colony) were siblings. Parallel analyses in which founders were held to be unrelated yielded qualitatively concordant analyses (results not shown). Inbreeding coefficients ranged from F = 0 (outbred) through to F = 0.5 (highly inbred) with mean F = 0.163 \u00b1 0.158 SD.",

Our data conformed to the assumption of proportional hazards; no evidence of nonproportionality was apparent in the smoothed, scaled Schoenfeld residual plots (Therneau and Grambsch 2002) and the inclusion of a timedependent covariate had a nonsignificant effect (P = 0.09). Model selection followed the \"main-effects first\" model-building strategy of Hosmer and Lemeshow (2000) . Only the effects shown in Table 1 were entered into the final model; we excluded body mass as an explanatory variable after preliminary runs showed that its presence did not significantly improve the model (likelihood ratio test: 2 = 1.27; P = 0.26). All two-and three-way interaction terms not shown in Table 1 were excluded in a similar fashion. Because the 10 colonies were housed in three separate constant environment rooms, we accounted for possible location effects by stratifying the final model by \"room number,\" and nested within that, \"colony.\" An unstratified model, however, yielded virtually identical results. To assess the relative effect of different levels of inbreeding on survival, we calculated hazard ratios (Therneau and Grambsch 2002) for F at discrete values. Finally, inbreeding depression was estimated in terms of the number of lethal equivalents per gamete, calculated as per Kalinowski and Hedrick (1998) . ",

Inbred naked mole-rats were significantly more likely to die than their outbred counterparts, displaying inbreeding depression of a magnitude similar to that observed in other captive rodents (naked mole-rats: B = 1.13; other rodents: mean B = 1.15; calculated for n = 7 captive taxa; Ralls et al. 1988 ). Note, however, that this estimate of lethal equivalents does not account for variation in other variables (sex, age, breeding status) that were found to affect mortality (Table 1) , and may thus be an underestimate. Moreover, this figure does not account for Allee effects associated with the obligate social lifestyle of naked mole-rats. In the wild, naked mole-rat colonies persist under harsh environmental conditions because the cooperative efforts of multiple foragers enable them to exploit patchy food resources. The loss of 87% of the workforce (as we observed in one colony) would almost certainly lead to local extinction of a wild colony. Thus, the true costs of inbreeding in the wild may well be higher than the estimates presented here. ",

Immune responsiveness is known to decline with age in various taxa (Adamo et al. 2001; Linton and Dorshkind 2004) , with a range of symptoms including a marked decline in T-cell production. Similarly, a male bias in susceptibility is a well-documented phenomenon (Klein 2000) , and in vertebrates is hypothesized to result at least in part from the immunosuppressive burden of testosterone (Folstad and Karter 1992) . Our data provide circumstantial support for this hypothesis, in that breeding males, which typically show highly elevated testosterone levels (Clarke and Faulkes 1998) , were especially vulnerable to the virus. The high survival among queens was unexpected, but may also have been partially hormone driven: glucocorticoid stress hormones, also known to be immunosuppressive (Sapolsky 1992) , are typically lower in naked mole-rat queens than in other colony members, except during pregnancy (Faulkes and Abbott 1997) . At such times stress hormone levels are elevated, most likely in response to acute energetic stress (R\u00e5berg et al. 1998) , and immune function is typically impaired (e.g., Nordling et al. 1998 ) Accordingly, of four molerat queens pregnant at the onset of the infection, two aborted and survived, whereas the two that carried their pups to full term succumbed to the virus. Other potential sources of energetic stress, and hence immunosuppression, such as differences in nutritional status (Gershwin et al. 1985) , workload (Deerenberg et al. 1997) , or thermoregulatory burden (Nelson and Demas 1996) , are unlikely to have contributed substantially to these results because all animals had lifelong access to ad libitum food and lived in a finely regulated physical environment.",

Thus, assessment of inbreeding depression in the absence of severe disease outbreaks may dramatically underestimate the true fitness costs of inbreeding.",

However, when an appropriate pathogen is ultimately encountered, these alleles may start to strongly affect fitness and thus will be exposed to selection.
