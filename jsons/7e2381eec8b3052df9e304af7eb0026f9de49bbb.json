Reporting visualizes data and can explain past events within the organisation. Analysis refers to the deep understanding of possible reasons for past events. Monitoring enables the organisation to understand what is currently happening within the organisation. Prediction is the action of using data and determining what could happen in future within the organisation, i.e. predict future events [13] . Although BDA can assist with providing insight on all four levels, the strength of BDA lies in the ability to predict and anticipate events based on current data. As a result, BDA can assist decision makings to create appropriate business strategies, providing them with the right knowledge to the correct people at the right time and in the right format [14] . Only after performing data analytics tasks can the organisation gain insight from big data. Insight is an actionable piece of knowledge that can drive decision making, strategic decision making and improve productivity and efficiency [2] .",

It furthermore considers the relationship between people, processes, and technology assisting managers to understand how the expected benefits will be delivered through the combination of technology and business changes. From an organisational perspective the one-page graphical model assists with the alignment of IT investments with the business strategy and highlights the fact that IT investments should not be driven by technology but rather by clear business objectives.",

The model furthermore identified specific relationships between components and the alignment to overall business strategy. From the results it is clear that BDA implementations should focus on more than just technology. Organisations will have to take a holistic approach when implementing BDA. Considerations should include important decisions with regards to the skills of people, which will have an impact on the structure of the organisation, business processes and technology changes to deliver benefits and investment objectives.
