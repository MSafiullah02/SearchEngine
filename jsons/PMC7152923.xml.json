In a nationwide population-based study conducted in Taiwan, Armeniacae Semen was the most frequently prescribed herb for the treatment of pediatric asthma [20]. Besides having antiasthmatic activity, Armeniacae Semen was also reported to inhibit Th2 cells, which are important for immune responses, reducing hyper-responsiveness in the airway [21]. This further validated the recommendation of Armeniacae Semen for the treatment of respiratory diseases in children.",

In the recommendations on adult treatment for COVID-19, the herb Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma was the herb with the highest frequency of usage [22]. This might be due to the difference in the spectrum of diseases between the children and the adults. The course of diseases in adults was reported to be more severe than children; thus, the herb Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma, which has both antiviral and anti-inflammatory qualities were highly used. On the other hand, the herb Armeniacae Semen, which is widely used of respiratory disease, was highly used as the severity of disease is milder in children.",
