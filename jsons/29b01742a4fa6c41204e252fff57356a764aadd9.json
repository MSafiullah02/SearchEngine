[7] [8] [9] More than 100 enterovirus genotypes are currently classified into four species, HEV-A, HEV-B, HEV-C, HEV-D, which have different pathogenic profiles and circulation patterns. 7, 10 Enteroviruses (EV) can cause symptoms similar to a mild cold, but have also been associated with severe respiratory infection requiring hospitalisation and may be fatal. 10 An outbreak of a re-emerging EV-D68 lineage causing severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) occurred in the USA and Canada in 2014, and these lineages were also detected in Europe, Asia, and South America from 2012 to 2013 samples. [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] Though EVs have been associated with SARI and influenza-like illness (ILI), 5 these viruses have been less well characterized in South Africa. We identified high diversity among EVs circulating in hospitalized South African patients, 25 however it is unknown whether different EV genotypes are associated with mild or severe respiratory illness in South Africa.",

There is no report of a concurrent E30 aseptic meningitis outbreak at the same time the E30 NP/OP positives were detected. It has been reported that genotypes of E30 can become dominant for 3-4-year periods before they disappear from circulation, 34 and they are therefore known as epidemic strains. In our study, it seems that E30 genotype k became dominant and circulated in South Africa during 2012-2014.

Sequences with open circles are EV-D68 strains previously identified from South Africa. Bootstrap values (1000 replicates) are shown on the branches, with values <65% omitted from the tree. The scale indicates number of base substitutions B2 co-circulated with lineage B1 EV-D68 during the large 2014 USA outbreak. EV-D68 lineages B1 and B2 are both temporally associated with AFM. 38 The majority of EV-D68 strains identified in our study clustered in lineage B2 and the remaining samples clustered in lineage A, forming a unique cluster. The 2012-2014 South African samples did not cluster with strains previously identified in South Africa during 2009-2011.",

A case of SARI was defined as a hospitalized individual with duration of symptoms \u226410 days, meeting age-specific clinical inclusion criteria as follows: children aged 2 days through <3 months with physician-diagnosed sepsis or lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), children aged 3 months through <5 years with physician-diagnosed LRTI and patients aged \u22655 years meeting a modified World Health Organization (WHO) case definition for SARI: (i) fever (>38\u00b0C) or reported fever; (ii) cough or sore throat; and (iii) shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing, with or without clinical or radiographic findings of pneumonia. Demographic and clinical characteristics were collected from all patients.Prospective surveillance for cases presenting with ILI were done at two outpatient clinics (Jouberton Clinic, North West Province, and Edendale Gateway Clinic, KwaZulu-Natal Province) located in the same catchment area to the above-mentioned hospitals from July 2012 through June 2014. An ILI case was defined as an outpatient of any age presenting with either temperature >38\u00b0C or, history of fever and cough of duration \u226410 days.5",
