            "text": "In the last decade, caliciviruses have become recognised as a major cause of non\u2010bacterial gastroenteritis in human adults (reviewed in [1]). Calici\u2010like viruses have been identified in association with calf diarrhoea, first in the UK [[2], [3]] and subsequently in Germany [[4], [5], [6]]. Unlike the human viruses, they have not been well characterised, in part due to the lack of a cell culture system and the apparently low numbers of particles in faeces. Two of the three reported bovine viruses, one from the UK (Newbury agent 2, NA2) [7] and one from Germany (Jena virus) [8], were shown recently to be members of the family Caliciviridae. In the present paper, we characterise the second bovine enteric calici\u2010like virus, Newbury agent 1 (NA1), identified in the UK to examine the hypothesis that NA1 is also a member of the family Caliciviridae and to explore its relationship to NA2.",

The original faecal samples also contained astroviruses, rotaviruses or coronaviruses which were removed as described previously. Pre\u2010 and post\u2010inoculation NA1 antisera were raised in a 50 days old gnotobiotic calf (P143) inoculated orally with 3 ml of a faecal filtrate of NA1 prepared by passage of a 25% faecal emulsion in PBS\u03b1 through a 0.45 \u03bcm membrane filter. The calf developed diarrhoea and recovered. Calici\u2010like virus particles were identified in faecal samples by electron microscopy but no other viruses were seen. Ten weeks later, a similar faecal filtrate was inoculated intravenously and the calf was bled out 5 days later to provide antiserum. The antiserum was free of antibodies to bovine astrovirus, the UK strain of bovine rotavirus, bovine enteric coronavirus, bovine viral diarrhoea virus, feline calicivirus and the Haden strain of bovine parvovirus (J.C. Bridger, personal observations). An NA1 immunoglobulin concentrate was kindly prepared from the calf antiserum by Dave Harkins, The Moredun Research Institute, Edinburgh using a protein A Sepharose fast flow column (Pharmacia Biotech). The NA2 immunoglobulin concentrate was described previously [7].",

Considerable care was taken to determine the molecular mass of the NA1 capsid protein by electrophoresis of the capsid protein with molecular mass standard proteins. Capsid proteins with molecular masses less than 55 kDa have been associated with some calicivirus capsids but, in most instances, a higher molecular mass protein has been apparent [[21], [22], [23]]. There was no evidence that the NA1 49.4 kDa band represented a degradation product of the capsid protein. A higher molecular mass band was never seen in the NA1 preparations and the CsCl preparations used contained intact virus particles with typical SRSV size and morphology. Confirmation of the low NA1 capsid molecular mass will have to await elucidation of the deduced amino acid sequence of the NA1 capsid protein from genomic analysis and recombinant capsid expression studies. However, it has not been possible to amplify the NA1 genome from faecal suspensions or purified preparations using a range of PCR primers used successfully with NA2, further supporting the notion that bovine enteric caliciviruses are diverse.",

            "text": "SPIEM greatly improved detection of NA1 from faecal samples. Earlier studies used direct electron microscopy but only low numbers of particles were identified making it impossible to identify samples with adequate numbers of virions for further study [[2], [9]]. The present study showed that virions are not difficult to detect if early samples are examined by SPIEM. SPIEM enabled NA1 to be detected in the absence of a cell culture infectivity assay or knowledge about its genomic composition and, thus, allowed us to characterise the virus. The short period of virus shedding seen in the experimental calves by SPIEM was similar to that found in experimental infections with the previously described bovine enteric calicivirus NA2 [7] and the human Norwalk virus [[24], [25]] but contrasts markedly with bovine rotaviruses, another enteric pathogen, which are excreted at high levels for 4\u20136 days. The short virus excretion period and the lack of a broadly reactive and sensitive detection method may explain why so few investigators have reported the involvement of caliciviruses in outbreaks of calf diarrhoea. Enteropathogens were not detected in 31% of diarrhoeic faecal samples in a study of the microbiology of calf diarrhoea in the UK [3]. Failure to detect caliciviruses may be the reason for the lack of a diagnosis and further studies are warranted.",
