When scheduling the virtual appointment, patients can be sent a virtual visit checklist and are encouraged to confirm a number of items prior to the virtual orthopaedic examination. Patients are instructed to connect to a testing website to confirm their camera and microphone settings prior to the virtual encounter. Guidelines on proper positioning of the camera, location and lighting, and clothing to allow for appropriate visibility and examination of the affected body part can help to prepare for the visit. The specific details of such a protocol are listed in Table I. Prepared photographs or videos demonstrating examination maneuvers can be sent to the patient before the visit. As many musculoskeletal conditions require surgeons to rely on examination findings to triage and manage injuries, preparing and standardizing the conditions of the virtual examination can help to optimize the quality and efficiency of the encounter.",

Deficiency in range of motion can be an important indication for further imaging or treatment. Range of motion is assessed in the standing or sitting position. Measurements can be obtained using a web-based goniometer, which, in our case, was used as a browser extension (Protractor; Ben Burlingham3) that is compatible with most applications (including Zoom, InTouch Health, and Doxy.me) when launched through the Chrome browser (Google). Hyperextension is best assessed by viewing the leg from the side with the patient in the standing position and having the patient push the knee posteriorly while maintaining the foot planted (Fig. 1). Flexion is assessed by having the patient pull the heel toward the body in the sitting position.",

A positive finding occurs with pain and mechanical sensations over the side of the affected meniscus4,5. The calves and the distal aspects of the extremities are assessed for swelling, varicosities, and color changes. Strength testing against gravity can be performed for all muscle groups. Inability to actively extend the knee or the presence of an extensor lag indicate the potential disruption of the extensor mechanism and may require further imaging.

Digital lines can be added to evaluate for pelvic obliquity, and side-to-side comparisons of pixel measurements can serve as a substitute for leg-length or circumference measurements. Observation of the J sign in a sitting position facing the camera can be helpful in the evaluation of patellar instability.

Strength testing can be important to rule out spine-related symptoms and to identify muscle groups that can be targeted for rehabilitation. A straight-leg raise to test for hip strength and pain is performed. The evaluation of abduction strength in the side-lying position (gluteus medius, L5) can be assessed. Having the patient perform toe-walking can demonstrate strength in L5/S1 and having the patient perform heel-walking can demonstrate strength in L4. Hip extension strength (gluteals, L5/S1) can be assessed by having the patient arise from a chair without using the arms to assist (Fig. 3).",

The authors reported that it was safe to offer video-assisted consultations for select orthopaedic patients, with no adverse events reported as a result of this and no difference in patient-reported satisfaction and health9. In that study, a trained nurse was present with the patient, and the physician had remote control of the camera.

Russell et al.14 reported on the use of an internet-based goniometer to assess knee range of motion and found, in a comparison of 540 knee positions, that face-to-face measurements and internet measurements showed high intrarater and interrater reliability. The authors measured the angle from a laterally based view, using a line along the axis of the femur and a line drawn from the fibular head to the lateral malleolus. They concluded that the internet-based goniometer was a valid tool for measuring knee extension and flexion angles. Dent et al.6 reported on 52 elbows that underwent range-of-motion measurements in person, through teleconference, and with still photography. The authors reported high agreement between teleconference-based goniometry and in-person measurements, based on the evaluation of healthy control patients. Other authors have shown equivalent accuracy and greater precision in joint measurements with digital goniometry when compared with visual estimation in shoulder abduction, shoulder internal rotation, elbow flexion, hip abduction, and knee extension15,16.",
