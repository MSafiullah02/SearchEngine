            "text": "First described in December 2019, the severe acute respiratory syndrome associated with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) quickly evolved into a pandemic with severe and increasing worldwide morbidity and mortality. Although most infected patients have mild to moderate symptoms or are even asymptomatic, older patients or those with existing chronic diseases are at greater risk of developing serious complications such as pneumonia or multiple organ failures. COVID-19 respiratory infection is marked by dysregulated immune responses leading to significant respiratory pathology as well as increased probabilities for multi-organ pathologies. While the inflammatory pathways are still being elucidated, notable components include increased circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and other mediators including interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), induced protein 10 (IP10) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) [4, 6, 41]. There are also significant alterations in circulating inflammatory cell populations with initial lymphocytosis followed by severe lymphopenia, with increased ratios of helper to regulatory T cells [4, 6, 30]. Since dysregulated immune responses and the cytokine storm are triggers for development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), an increasing effort and current clinical trials are focused on immune therapeutic approaches such as IL-1 blockade (anakinra), IL-6 receptor blockade (tocilizumab) or Janus kinase (JAK) inhibition [22]. In parallel, there are a rapidly increasing number of cell-based therapy investigations, mostly utilizing mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) [12]. These are based on supporting pre-clinical data for use of MSCs delivered either systemically or intratracheally in pre-clinical models of acute lung injuries and on demonstration of safety of systemic MSC administration in recent trials for ARDS resulting from other etiologies [15, 21].",

MSC-EVs will be administered intravenously (ChiCTR2000030484), or by inhalation (NCT04276987, ChiCTR2000030261). The rationale for these approaches is based on a relatively small but growing number of investigations in pre-clinical lung injury and sepsis models, in which MSC-EV preparations were described as safe and effective, if not more effective than their parent cells [19, 40]. The approach is further supported by a growing body of literature on the therapeutic potential and mechanisms of EVs in a wide range of diseases, including recent positive results in a steroid-refractory Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD) patient treated with MSC-EVs, and in a single centre, randomized, placebo-controlled phase II/III clinical pilot study on chronic kidney disease (CDK) patients treated with MSC-EVs [14, 25].",

Nonetheless, effects observed in a range of pre-clinical non-COVID-19 model systems suggest that they may also have efficacy against COVID-19. For example, systemic administration of MSC-EV preparations modulated immune responses such as elevated cytokine storms in relevant lung disease models, including acute lung injury and sepsis [17, 20, 23, 24, 27, 35, 38, 42]. Notably, in E. coli induced pneumonia mouse models, MSC-EV administration was found to enhance phagocytosis of bacteria [9, 23]. In a pig model MSC-EVs were shown to attenuate influenza virus-induced acute lung injury, amongst others by inhibiting influenza virus replication [11]. Diseaseattenuating effects on inflammatory immune responses following MSC-EV administration have also been observed in other disease models [2]. In an ischemic stroke model, for example, systemic MSC-EV administration reduced stroke-induced lymphopenia and pro-inflammatory immune responses in the brain and periphery, resulting in overall improvement of disease symptoms [7, 37]. These preliminary observations support MSC-EV administration as a potential treatment option for COVID-19.",

Specifically, they seem to moderate acute immune responses towards regulatory responses, with the latter inducing tolerance and restoring homeostasis (Giebel and Hermann, 2019; Zhang et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2014). While tolerance induction in GvHD and other non-infectious diseases may be beneficial, it might also have severe adverse effects in the presence of replicating pathogens. Although influenza and E. coli infections were attenuated in selected models [9, 11, 23], other viruses and bacteria might conceivably expand in uncontrolled manners in induced tolerogenic environments.",

MSCs are a heterogeneous cell entity that can be obtained from different tissues. Even if derived from the same tissues, they may display interindividual and possibly clone specific functional differences [28, 29, 31, 36]. Indeed, side-by-side comparison of four MSC-EV preparations harvested from the conditioned media of different donor-derived bone marrow MSCs demonstrated significant variations in cytokine content [14]. Whether this correlates with therapeutic potency is not yet clear; however, in the example of the ischemic stroke model, it was demonstrated that MSC-EV preparations with comparable particle and protein contents can significantly differ in potency. While some preparations effectively suppressed stroke symptoms, others failed to exert therapeutic activities [37]. Furthermore, in an acute lung injury model, EVs from young but not from aged MSCs alleviated LPS-induced acute lung injury [10].",

Still, apart from their immunomodulatory capabilities, MSC-EVs apparently also control additional biological processes, some with approved therapeutic functions [1], and others that might trigger unforeseen side effects. Just recently, it was found that adipose-derived MSC-EVs had higher thrombogenic activities than bone-marrow-derived MSC-EVs [3, 34]. Thus, the source of parental cells might increase thrombosis risks. Coupled to the finding that activation of complement pathways and an associated procoagulant state seem to result in catastrophic microvascular injury syndrome in a proportion of severe COVID-19 cases [18], MSC-EV administration could even be counterproductive in COVID-19.",

The ethical guidelines produced by the World Health Organization (WHO) are a useful baseline.2\nThe urgency of the current outbreak does not justify administration of EVs in uncontrolled compassionate use settings and does not obviate the need to register clinical trials, obtain informed consent from patients or proxies, and otherwise comply with good clinical practice (GCP). In particular, even limited compassionate use should employ well-characterized MSC-EV preparations produced through strict GMP conditions under the oversight of the relevant national regulatory entity. Additional outbreak-specific measures may be needed, including establishment of simplified clinical protocols for hospitalized patients, such as the WHO COVID-19 core protocol, minimizing risks to trial integrity,3\nchanging logistics of trial participant visits (e.g. implementation of remote assessments), and protocol changes for the sake of hazard minimization that may need to be implemented and reported, in Europe, to the Institute for Research in Biomedicine (IRB) Barcelona after the fact. Certainly, regulatory flexibility and support is helpful to foster developments, such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) special emergency program for possible therapies, the Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program (CTAP),4\nthe European Medicines Agency (EMA) COVID-19 pandemic Task Force (COVID-ETF) activities,5\nthe EMA guidance for medicine developers and companies on COVID-196\nand the guidelines for clinical trials published by an EMA coordinated group7\n, or the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA),8\nrespectively. Most or all of the considerations covered for cell-based therapies are also applicable to EV investigations.",
