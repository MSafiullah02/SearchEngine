T7 transcription generates complementary RNA from the dsDNA\ntemplate. The Cas13\u2013tracrRNA complex binds to the target sequence,\nwhich activates the general nuclease enzyme activity of Cas13 to cleave\nthe target sequence and the fluorescent RNA reporter. Method B (DETECTR\nassay31): RT-RPA (recombinase polymerase amplification) converts viral\nRNA to dsDNA. The Cas12a\u2013tracrRNA complex binds to the target\nsequence, which activates the general nuclease enzyme activity of\nCas12a to cleave the target sequence and the fluorescent RNA reporter.",
