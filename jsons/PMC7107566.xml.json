The 4 participant sites encompassed 20 hospitals and had a catchment population of approximately 4% of the US population aged <2 years. Hospitalization was defined as an admission to an inpatient hospital ward regardless of whether the patient stayed overnight. Date of hospital admission was defined as the date of admission to the inpatient ward. RSV cases were identified through hospital admission, discharge, laboratory, and infection-control practitioner logs. Laboratory testing for RSV was clinician-driven, and cases were identified by positive test results based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR), rapid test (antigen detection), viral culture, or fluorescent antibody. Children were included in surveillance if they were aged <2 years, a resident in the surveillance catchment area, and had community-onset RSV, defined as diagnosis of laboratory-confirmed RSV infection within 7 days prior to or 3 days after hospital admission. We aimed to identify acute cases (diagnosed no longer than 10 days from illness onset). Only cases identified as laboratory-confirmed RSV in the first 3 days of hospitalization were included to avoid inclusion of possible nosocomial RSV infections. Medical records were reviewed for sociodemographic data (age, sex, race, ethnicity, insurance type), RSV testing results, medical history, palivizumab receipt (any time and any number of doses during the season), and clinical course, including admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), need for mechanical ventilation (including extracorporeal membrane oxygenation), and diagnosis of coinfections with other bacterial or viral pathogens.",

The code selection was based on a population-based study that tested prospectively all children with respiratory illness for RSV using PCR. Testing was done as part of research, and results were not shared with clinicians [11]. We looked at the most common ICD-9 codes used in children aged <2 years who were hospitalized with respiratory illness and confirmed as RSV that covered >95% of the cases. We selected a stratified random sample of at least 80 eligible patients per month (December through April) and by age group (15 from <3 months, 15 from 3\u20135 months, 20 from 6\u201311 months, and 30 from 12\u201323 months).

Detection probabilities were estimated as the inverse product of the proportion of patients tested for RSV and the sensitivities of the tests performed, adjusted by site. The sensitivity of rapid antigen tests varies from 70% to 90% [14\u201316]. For the purpose of this analysis, we used an estimated sensitivity of 80% for rapid antigen tests in a pediatric population [14, 15], 100% for molecular diagnosis [15, 17, 18], 90% for cell culture [19], and 85% for immunofluorescence [20, 21]. The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for hospitalization rates were calculated by bootstrapping the number of hospitalizations and the detection multiplier, accounting for variability of testing and test sensitivities by site. Assuming the observed rates were similar to the true rates, we extrapolated these rates and their 95% CIs to the US population using 2014 census data to estimate the burden of community-onset RSV-associated hospitalizations for the entire US population. All analyses were performed using R software (version 3.4.0) and Microsoft Excel 2016 (v16.0).",

Public health insurance was frequent (approximately 70% of cases) in California, Georgia, Oregon, whereas 62% of RSV cases in Minnesota had private insurance. Sixty-seven percent (1047) had no underlying medical condition.

Overall, 6% (93) of admissions required mechanical ventilation (range, 2%\u20139% by site). The median length of hospital stay was 3 days (IQR, 2, 5). There were 5 deaths; among them, 4/5 were aged \u22646 months, 3/5 were born prematurely (range, 33\u201335 weeks of gestation), and we did not identify palivizumab receipt in any of these cases, although outpatient records were not reviewed.

Hall et al [1] estimated an annual average of 520 RSV-associated hospitalizations per 100 000 children aged <2 years between 2000 and 2005. Moreover, Iwane et al [22] reported 1850 and 740 RSV-associated hospitalizations per 100 000 children aged 0\u20135 months and 6\u201311 months, respectively, for 1 season. Similar to FluSurv-NET, RSV was identified by molecular assays; however, NVSN systematically tests those who meet the ARI case definition, whereas FluSurv-NET collects data on patients with an RSV-confirmed diagnosis who were tested at the discretion of clinicians, hence, the need for case ascertainment adjustments. Other studies that used different estimation methods presented similar findings [8, 9, 23\u201326]. Nonetheless, compared with our study, Homaira et al [25], in New South Wales, Australia, used administrative datasets that followed 870 314 children aged <5 years from 2001 to 2010 and reported higher annual incidence rates for RSV hospitalizations among healthy children aged 0\u20133, 4\u20136, 7\u201311, and 12\u201324 months to be 2560, 1670, 470, and 280 per 100 000, respectively [25]. Similarly, a prospective severe respiratory illness surveillance study in 3 hospitals in 2 South African provinces reported an incidence of RSV-associated hospitalizations of 6593, 3411, 1494, and 409 per 100 000 for children aged 0\u20132, 3\u20135, 6\u201311, and 12\u201323 months, respectively [27]. Hospitalization rates from these 2 studies were higher compared with our estimate. In Australia they did not have laboratory-confirmed cases and relied on administrative codes for acute lower respiratory tract infections and RSV, which could partly explain the higher rates. There could also be differences due to the underlying characteristics of the study populations, including a high prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus in South Africa [28]. Notably, for all of these approaches and in all settings, the highest rates were in the youngest age group, which is an important consideration for targeting interventions.",

Severity indicators such as respiratory distress (59% in Georgia to 85% in Oregon) and wheezing (19% in Georgia to 44% in Oregon) varied by site, which could indicate different criteria for admission or different underlying characteristics of the populations at each study site. We observed that ICU admission varied substantially among our 4 study sites (from 13% to 45%), which could be explained by different thresholds for admission and different testing practices among participating FluSurv-NET hospitals [36]. Overall, 90% of the ICU-admitted children were tested for RSV compared with 75% among those not admitted to the ICU. Testing rates among ICU-admitted children and non\u2013ICU-admitted children were similar among the very young age group, but differences up to approximately 20% can be seen among older age groups (Supplementary Table 9). When we looked at variation of testing by site and ICU admission, Georgia and Oregon were 40% more likely to test children in the ICU than those not in the ICU. Other factors, including gestational age at delivery, age at hospital admission, and type of insurance, may also influence ICU admission practices [33]. Most importantly, Georgia had the highest rate of ICU admissions and children requiring mechanical ventilation (9% compared with a low of 2% in California), and 4 of the 5 identified deaths occurred in Georgia. Overall, the proportion of ICU admissions in our study was higher than described in the US study by Rodriguez-Fernandez et al (10% vs 27% reported in our study), which was based on 2 pediatric hospitals [34], but with a substantially smaller sample size (253 children aged <2 years compared with our sample of more than 1500 children) that may explain the variation. Similar to other studies [3, 32], mechanical ventilation was used in <10% of the cases. Furthermore, 67% of all hospitalized cases had no clear risk factor for severe disease, consistent with a previous report [35] and highlighting the importance of developing new interventions that can be broadly applied to infants.",

However, this is not the case every year and would need to be taken into account to avoid substantial underestimation of RSV-associated burden. We applied a previously described method to adjust for inherent factors of the surveillance system such as under-ascertainment of cases due to variability in testing practices and diagnostic test sensitivity [12, 15, 16]. Although RSV testing overall was high among children aged <2 years with respiratory symptoms, we observed a substantial decrease in testing among children aged \u22656 months, necessitating the adjustment.",

Nonetheless, the 4 sites together provided a diverse population, and their catchment population reflected 4% of the US population aged <2 years. However, results may not be generalizable to the entire US population. Including additional hospitals in the future would allow for more robust assessments, lessening the impact of variability in clinical practices among healthcare settings. Second, surveillance was limited to 1 season. Several years of surveillance are needed for robust burden estimates because there can be variations in RSV circulation and severity from year to year [11]. Third, we only obtained data on RSV testing practices from December 2014 to April 2015 and did not include October 2014 and November 2014. While this may have underestimated our rate calculation, the observed variability for the underdetection multipliers by month is small, particularly among children aged 0\u20132 months (Supplementary Table 8). Fourth, we used 90% sensitivity for viral culture based on a previous reference [19]. Weinberg et al [37] found low sensitivity for RSV diagnosis by culture (36%) when compared with real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [37]. However, for the analytic part of this study, culture represented only approximately 6% of those tested. Finally, we based the correction of case ascertainment on ICD-9 codes that were preselected based on the most common codes identified through surveillance among RSV cases from other studies [1]. As such, we may have inadvertently missed RSV cases who did not meet the preselected criteria, which could have led to a slight underestimation of hospitalization rates. On the other hand, since several of the preselected ICD-9 codes are not specific for RSV, we may have included hospitalizations associated with other respiratory viruses that cocirculated during this time [38]. Despite these limitations, our estimates of RSV-associated hospitalization rates were similar to those previously reported in systematic surveillance following the ARI case definition (sudden symptom onset with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and other related conditions including apnea and rule-out sepsis) [22, 39], validating the capability of FluSurv-NET to provide estimates of RSV-associated hospitalization rates.",

This laboratory-based approach that adjusts for testing practices and diagnostic testing sensitivity may produce robust estimates of RSV disease burden to inform prevention strategies and, when used over the years (as it is the case for influenza), could allow for the assessment of the impact of public health interventions. Future studies using this approach could consider a correction factor for differential testing based on severity, as we reported above to be the case for ICU-admitted children in some sites, and should consider expanding surveillance to best capture RSV seasons that do not overlap with circulation of influenza viruses.",
