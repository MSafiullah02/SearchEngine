However, the consensus method for detecting these viruses has not been well established. A rapid and sensitive microarray approach for detection of these viruses and a panel of specific probes covering nine genera and 16 virus species were designed. 70-mer oligonucleotides were used at the genus level and 50-mer oligonucleotides were at the species level, respectively. To decrease the interference of the host genome in hybridization, the consensus genus primers were designed and used to reverse transcribe only virus genome. The synthesis of the second strand was carried out with a random primer sequence (5 0 -GTTTCCCAGTAGGTCTCNNNNNNNN-3 0 ). The amplified products were labeled and processed for microarray analyses. This microarray-based method used the highly conserved consensus primers to synthesize specifically the virus cDNA and could identify effectively Chikungunya virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, Yellow fever virus, Dengue virus, Tick borne encephalitis virus, and H5N1 avian influenza virus. Using this method, one unknown virus isolated from pig brain in Shanxi Province, China was identified. This method may have an important potential application for the diagnosis of virus infection.",

            "text": "It is important to develop accurate methods for detecting and identifying the highly pathogenic viruses which can cause severe diseases. These viruses include Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEE), Western equine encephalitis virus (WEE) and Chikungunya virus (CHIK) which belong to genus Alphavirus; Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), Yellow fever virus (YFV), and Dengue virus (DEN) which belong to genus Flavivirus; and others such as Hanta virus, H5N1 avian influenza virus, Rift Valley virus (Rift) and SARS-CoV. Many of these viruses have been considered as potential biological warfare agents. Therefore, accurate detection and identification of these pathogens is a prerequisite for effective control of their transmission. In recent years, a wide range of detection methods such as electron microscopy, ELISA, PCR (or real-time PCR) and IFA have been developed and are used currently in laboratory diagnosis. However, all these methods are designed to detect a single or just a few targets. When unknown pathogens are presented, multiple diagnostic assays have to be performed in parallel, which is a timeconsuming process. Microarray, which is high throughput and can detect multiple targets on a single chip, is a promising diagnostic tool for detection of pathogens [Elnifro et al., 2000; David et al., 2002; Kessler et al., 2004; Oh et al., 2004; Jehanara et al., 2005; Kostrzynska et al., 2006] .",

The data was analyzed by the Genepix Pro software. The Cy3 intensity of each viral probe was plotted with a continuous linear color scale. The Cy3 intensity of >1,000 and the ratio of Cy3/Cy5 >2 were used as the criterion for positive identification. The higher the Cy3 signal is, the more likely the detected pathogen belongs to the viral species represented by the probes [Korimbocus et al., 2005] .",

Given one virus species, only the reaction tube with the matched primers could specifically initiate the cDNA synthesis of the virus.

Nucleic acid amplification of viral genomes needs to be performed J. Med. Virol. DOI 10.1002/jmv before hybridization in a DNA microarray. Generic [Coiras et al., 2003] , multiplex [Casas and Garc\u00eda-Ochoa, 1999; Calvario et al., 2002] and random PCR procedures [Bohlander et al., 1992; Elnifro et al., 2000; David et al., 2002] have been employed for viral genome amplification. Generic PCR is designed to amplify a target sequence from a group of related viruses (e.g., those from the same genus or family). Multiplex PCR involves the combination of several primer sets targeting different sequence regions in one amplification reaction. Viral pathogens amplified by these two methods are limited to small numbers, such as viruses in a genus, or neurological viruses. A random PCR procedure is used to detect a large number of viral pathogens, including unknown or unrecognized viruses [David et al., 2002] . However, this strategy requires complicated computational analysis of hybridization results due to the interference of the host genome. In this study, a panel of consensus primers was designed in order to increase the specificity of reverse transcription and reduce the interference of the host genome from subsequent random PCR procedure. Moreover, by using three groups of reverse transcription primers, this microarray could significantly increase the spectrum of detecting viruses.",

            "text": "Our previous microarray analysis showed that the hybridization of random amplified PCR products of the virus genome without any purification can cause a high rate of cross reaction and give the false positive signals. This may result from the contamination of RNA from host cells. In order to increase the hybridization specificity, the genus primers were designed for reverse transcription of the viral RNAs, which could specifically initiate the virus cDNA synthesis. This step may greatly reduce the random amplification of host-cell genes. Indeed, little cross hybridization between viruses was observed, demonstrating the effectiveness of this method.",

This microarray was used successfully to identify an unknown virus isolated from a pig brain. This unknown pathogen was identified as Japanese encephalitis virus by the microarray and the result was confirmed by specific RT-PCR and sequence analysis. All these results indicate that this microarray method is an effective tool for detecting these highly pathogenic viruses.",
