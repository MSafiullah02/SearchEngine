            "text": "Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common viral illness that usually affects infants and young children of 5 years old or younger. The clinical features of HFMD typically begin with mild fever, sore throat, poor appetite, and diarrhea. A day or two later, blisters form in the mouth and a rash develops on the cheeks, gums, and the tongue, potentially with life-threatening neurological complications, such as encephalitis. The causative agents of HFMD have been identified as coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) and enterovirus 71 (EV71) viruses, accounting for more than 70% of the cases during the 2008 outbreak in China (WHO, 2008). CVA16 and EV71 are single strand RNA viruses of the Enterovirus genus. The viruses can be spread through direct contact with blisters and other surfaces contaminated with virus-containing fluids or through fecal\u2013oral route. HFMD occurs sporadically around the world since its first report in 1957. Large outbreaks of HFMD with higher morbidity and mortality have become common in the Asia Pacific region. An outbreak in 2008 affected nearly half million children with 126 deaths in eastern China (Yang et al., 2009). Data reported to the Ministry of Public Health of China showed that more than one million cases annually and hundreds of deaths associated with HFMD in China for the past 3 years (www.moh.gov.cn). There is no vaccine or specific antiviral drugs available for HFMD. Good hygiene, including hand washing and disinfection of surfaces in child care facilities, therefore remains as the most effective approach to reduce the transmission rate of HFMD (Solomon et al., 2010, Ma et al., 2011).",

The plant extract has also been used as flavoring agents for food and beverages with a relative safe profile. During the outbreaks of HFMD in China, medicinal herbs or herbal preparations have demonstrated therapeutic efficacy by ameliorating the symptoms of the disease and/or shortening the course of the disease. Most of the herbs with reported therapeutic effectiveness have been used traditionally or folklorically for inflammatory and/or infective diseases (Xue et al., 2011, Cao et al., 2012).",

GA at millimolar concentrations inhibits growth and cytopathology of several unrelated viruses, while not affecting cell activity and ability to replicate (Pompei et al., 1979).

Plants in the genus contain triterpenoid saponins such as glycyrrhizic acid, dihydroflavonoids like liquiritin, and polysaccharides (Asl and Hosseinzadeh, 2008), with GA as the principal component for antiviral activities. GA has three carboxylic acid groups and can be selectively precipitated by acidification of an aqueous solution. To preliminarily determine whether GA was responsible for Glycyrrhiza uralensis antiviral activity, we precipitate GA from water extract of Glycyrrhiza uralensis with H2SO4 and detected the antiviral activity of precipitant and supernatant. Consistent with GA as an antiviral component, depletion of GA by acid precipitation obviated the antiviral activity of the extract (\nFig. 3A and B). As expected, the acidic precipitant which has GA content significantly enriched showed strong antiviral activity against both CVA16 and EV71. At 200 \u03bcg/ml, the precipitant blocked infectious CVA16 and EV71 production by 2.2 and 1.7 logs, respectively, suggesting GA as a primary antiviral component of Glycyrrhiza uralensis.",

The compound directly inactivates CVA16, while it inhibits EV71 infection apparently through an event post cell entry of the virus. Glycyrrhizic acid exhibits antiviral activity with multiple mechanisms, including direct deactivation of HSV-1 (Pompei et al., 1979), reduction of host cell membrane fluidity (Harada, 2005), inhibition of fusion of enveloped viruses (Wolkerstorfer et al., 2009), impairment of hepatitis B virus surface antigen transport (Sato et al., 1996), or disruption of RNA polymerase II pausing, resulting in loss of proper mRNA production and defects in sister chromatid cohesion (Kang and Lieberman, 2011). Glycyrrhizin inhibits highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza A virus infection and virus replication through its antioxidative effects in H5N1-infected cells (Michaelis et al., 2010, Michaelis et al., 2011). The mechanism of GA inhibition of EV71 infection remains unknown.",

In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase I/II trial of chronic hepatitis C, intravenous delivery of glycyrrhizin at 80, 160, and 240 mg, thrice weekly, lowers serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) during the treatment, but no effect on HCV-RNA levels was detected (van Rossum et al., 1999).
