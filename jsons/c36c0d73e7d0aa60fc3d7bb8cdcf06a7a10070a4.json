            "text": "This paper illustrates five different techniques to assess the distinctiveness of topics, key terms and features, speed of information dissemination, and network behaviors for Covid19 tweets. First, we use pattern matching and second, topic modeling through Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to generate twenty different topics that discuss case spread, healthcare workers, and personal protective equipment (PPE). One topic specific to U.S. cases would start to uptick immediately after live White House Coronavirus Task Force briefings, implying that many Twitter users are paying attention to government announcements. We contribute machine learning methods not previously reported in the Covid19 Twitter literature. This includes our third method, Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), that identifies unique clustering-behavior of distinct topics to improve our understanding of important themes in the corpus and help assess the quality of generated topics. Fourth, we calculated retweeting times to understand how fast information about Covid19 propagates on Twitter. Our analysis indicates that the median retweeting time of Covid19 for a sample corpus in March 2020 was 2.87 hours, approximately 50 minutes faster than repostings from Chinese social media about H7N9 in March 2013. Lastly, we sought to understand retweet cascades, by visualizing the connections of users over time from fast to slow retweeting. As the time to retweet increases, the density of connections also increase where in our sample, we found distinct users dominating the attention of Covid19 retweeters. One of the simplest highlights of this analysis is that early-stage descriptive methods like regular expressions can successfully identify high-level themes which were consistently verified as important through every subsequent analysis.",

Topics generated by LDA can be difficult to interpret and while there exist coherence values [22] that are intended to score the interpretability of topics, they continue to be difficult to interpret and are subjective. As a result, we apply UMAP, a dimensionality reduction algorithm and visualization tool that \"clusters\" documents by topic. Vectorizing the tweets using term-frequency inverse-document-frequency (TF-IDF) and plotting a UMAP visualization with the assigned topics from LDA allowed us to identify strongly localized and distinct topics. We then visualized \"retweet cascades\", which describes how a social media network propagates information [23] , through the use of graph models to understand how dense networks become over time and which users dominate the Covid19 conversations.",

Our dataset is a collection of tweets from different time periods shown in Table V . Using the Twitter API through tweepy, a Python Twitter mining and authentication API, we first queried the Twitter track on twelve query terms to capture a healthcare-focused dataset: 'ICU beds', 'ppe', 'masks', 'long hours', 'deaths', 'hospitalized', 'cases', 'ventilators', 'respiratory', 'hospitals', '#covid', and '#coronavirus'. For the keyword analysis, topic modeling, and UMAP tasks, we analyzed non-retweets that brought the corpus down to 5,506,223 tweets. In the Time-to-Retweet and Network Analysis, we included retweets but selected a sample out of the larger 23.8 million corpus of 736,561 tweets.

LDA is a bag of words model where each vector is a count of terms. LDA requires the number of topics to be specified. Similar to methods described by Syed et al.

We selected the LDA model that generated 20 topics, with a medium coherence value score of 0.344. Roder et al.

Similar to the high-level trends inferred from extracting keywords, themes about PPE and healthcare workers dominate the nature of topics. The terms generated also indicate emerging words in public conversation including \"hydroxychloroquine\" and \"asymptomatic\". Our results also show four topics that are in non-English languages. In our preprocessing, we removed non-Latin characters in order to filter out a high volume of Arabic and Chinese characters. In Twitter there exists a Tweet object metadata field of \"lang\" for language to filter tweets by a specific language like English (\"eng\"). However, we decided not to filter against the \"lang\" element because upon observation, approximately 2.5% of the dataset consisted of an \"undefined\" language tag, meaning that no language was indicated. Although it appears to be a small fraction, removing even the \"undefined\" tweets would have removed several thousand tweets. Some of these tweets that are tagged as \"undefined\" are in English but contain hashtags, emojis, and Arabic characters. As a result, we did not filter out for English language, leading our topics to be a mix of English, Spanish, Italian, French, and Portuguese. Although this introduced challenges in interpretation, we feel it demonstrates the global nature of worldwide conversations about Covid19 occurring on Twitter. This is consistent with what Singh et al. Singh et al. [10] reported as a variety of languages in Covid19 tweets upon analyzing over 2 million tweets. As a result, we labeled the four topics by the language of the terms in the respective topics: \"Spanish\" (Topic 1), \"Portuguese\" (Topic 14), \"Italian\" (Topic 16) and \"French\" (Topic 19). We used Google Translate to infer the language of the terms.",

For each plot, we labeled each topic with the first three terms of each topic for interpretability. In our trend analysis, we summed the number of tweets per minute, and then applied a moving weighted average of 60 minutes for topics March 24 -March 28, and 60 minutes for topics March 30 to April 8th. We provided two different plots in order to visualize smaller time frames such as March 24 of 44 minutes compared to Figure 3 and Figure 4 show similar trends on a time-series basis per minute across the entire corpora of 5,506,223 tweets. These plots are in a style of \"broken axes\" 2 to indicate that the corpora are not continuous periods of time, but discrete time frames, which we selected to plot on one axis for convenience and legibility. We direct the reader to Table V for reference on the start and end datetimes, which are in UTC format, so please adjust accordingly for time zone. The x-axis denotes the number of minutes, where the entire 2 https://github.com/bendichter/brokenaxes corpora is 8463 total minutes of tweets. Figure 3 shows that for the corpora of March 24, 25, and 28, the topics (denoted in hash-marked lines) focused on Topic 18 \"potus\" and Topic 13 \"mask.ppe.ventil\" trended greatest. For the later time periods of March 30, March 31, April 4, 5 and 8 in Figure 4 , Topic 18 \"potus\" and Topic 13 \"mask.ppe.ventil\" (also in hash-marked lines) continued to trended high. It is also interesting that Topic 18 was never replaced as the top trending topic, across a span of 17 days (April 8, 2020 also includes early hours of April 9 2020 EST), potentially as this may have been a proxy for active government listening. The time series would temporally decrease in frequency during overnight hours, between the We applied change point detection in the time series of tweets per minute for Topic 18 in the datasets March 24, 2020, April 3 -4, 2020, April 5 -6, 2020, and April 8, 2020, to identify whether the live press briefings coincided with inflections in time. Using the ruptures Python package [27] containing a variety of change point detection methods, we used binary segmentation [28] , a standard method for change point detection. Given a sequence of data y 1:n = (y 1 , ..., y n ) the model will have m changepoints with their positions \u03c4 1:m = (\u03c4 1 , ..., \u03c4 m ). Each changepoint position is an integer between 1 and n \u2212 1. The m changepoints split the time series data into m + 1 segments, with the ith segment containing y ( \u03c4 i\u22121 + 1) : \u03c4 i . Changepoints are identified by minimizing a cost function, C for a given segment, where \u03b2f (m) is a penalty to prevent overfitting.",

Note, prior to fitting the vectorizer, our corpus of tweets was pre-processed during the keyword analysis stage. We chose to visualize how the 20 topics grouped together using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) [38] . UMAP is a dimension reduction algorithm that finds a low dimensional representation of data with similar topological properties as the high dimensional space. It measures the local distance of points across a neighborhood graph of the high dimensional data, capturing what is called a fuzzy topological representation of the data. Optimization is then used to find the closest fuzzy topological structure by first approximating nearest neighbors using the Nearest-Neighbor-Descent algorithm and then minimizing local distances of the approximate topology using stochastic gradient descent [39] . When compared to t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), UMAP has been observed to be faster [40] with clearer separation of groups.",

A very distinct and separated mass of purple tweets represents the \"100: N/A\" topic which is an undefined topic. This means that the LDA model outputted equal scores across all 20 topics for any single tweet. As a result, we could not assign a topic to these tweets because they all had uniform scores. But this visualization informs us that the contents of these tweets were uniquely distinct from the others. Examples of tweets in this \"100: N/A\" cateogry include \"See, #Democrats are always guilty of whatever\", \"Why are people still getting in cruise ships?!?\", \"Thank you Mike you are always helping others and sponsoring Anchors media shows.\", \"We cannot let this woman's brave and courageous actions go to waste! #ChinaLiedPeopleDied #Chinaneedstopay\", \"I wish people in this country would just stay the hell home instead of GOING TO THE BEACH\".

It is intuitive to see that URLs are being retweeted quickly by the presence of \"https\" in the body of the retweeted text. This is also consistent with studies by Suh et al. [50] who indicated that tweets with URLs were a significant factor impacting retweetability. We found terms that were frequently mentioned during the early-stage keyword analysis and topic modeling mentioned again: \"cases\", \"ventilators\", \"hospitals\", \"deaths\", \"masks\", \"test\", \"american\", \"cuomo\", \"york\", \"president\", \"china\", and \"news\". When analyzing the descriptions of the users who were retweeted in Figure 21 , we ran the TF-IDF vectorizer on bigrams in order to elicit more interpretable terms. User accounts whose tweets were rapidly retweeted, appeared to describe themselves as political, news-related, or some form of social media account, all of which are difficult to verify as real or fake.",

NETWORK MODELING We analyzed the network dynamics of nine different time periods within the March 24 -28, 2020 Covid19 dataset, and visualized them based on their speed of retweeting. These types of graphs have been referred to as \"retweet cascades\" which describes how a social media network propagates information [23] . Similar methods have been applied for visualizing rumor propogation by Jin et al. [23] We wanted to analyze how Covid19 retweeting behaves at different time points. We used published disaster retweeting times to serve as benchmarks for selecting time periods. As a result, the graphs in Figure 8 are plotted by retweeting time of known benchmarks -the median time to retweet after an earthquake which implies rapid notification, the median time to retweet after a funnel cloud has been seen, all the way to a one-day or 24 hour time period. We did this to visualize a retweet cascade of fast to slow information propogation. We used median retweeting times published Spiro et al. [45] for the time it took users to retweet messages based on hazardous keywords like \"Funnel Cloud\", \"Aftershock\", and \"Mudslide\". We also used the H7N9 reposting time which Zhang et al. [49] published of 3.7 hours. We generated a Directed Graph for each of the nine time periods, where the network consisted of a source which was the author of the tweet (User object, the id_str) and a target which was the original retweeter shown in Table IV . The goal was to analyze how connections change as the retweeting speed increases. The nine networks are visualized in Figure 8 . Graphs were plotted using networkx and drawn using the Kamada Kawai Layout [51] , a force-directed algorithm. We modeled 700 users for each graph. We found that more nodes became too difficult to interpret. The size of the node indicates the number of degrees, or users that it is connected to. It can mean that the node has been retweeted by others several times. Or, it can also mean that the node itself has been retweeted by others several times.",

Very rapid retweeters, in the time it takes to retweet after an earthquake, start off with a sparse network with a few nodes in the center being the focus of retweets in Figure 8a . By the time we reach Figure 8d , the retweeted users are much more clustered in the center and there are more connections and activity. The top retweeted user in our median time network Figure 8g , was a news network and tweeted \"The team took less than a week to take the ventilator from the drawing board to working prototype, so that it can\". By 24 hours out in Figure 8h , we see a concentrated set of users being retweeted and by Figure 8i , one account appears to dominate the space being retweeted 92 times. This account was retweeting the following message several times \"She was doing #chemotherapy couldn't leave the house because of the threat of #coronavirus so her line sisters...\". In addition, the number of nodes generally decreased from 1278 in \"earthquake\" time to 1067 in one week, and the density also generally increased, shown in Table IV. These retweet cascade graphs provide only an exploratory analysis. Network structures like these have been used to predict virality of messages, for example memes over time as the message is diffused across networks [52] . But, analyzing them further could enable 1) an improved understanding about how Covid19 information diffusion is different than other outbreaks, or global events, 2) How information is transmitted differently from region to region across the world, and 3) What users and messages are being concentrated on over time. This would support strategies to improve government communications, emergency messaging, dispelling medical rumors, and tailoring public health announcements.",

However, there appears to be variability in terms of consistent corpora sizes in the Twitter analysis literature both in Table I Fifth, our compute limitations prohibited us from analyzing a larger corpus for the UMAP, time-series, and network modeling. For the LDA models we leveraged the gensim Mul-ticoreLDA model that allowed us to leverage multiprocessing across 20 workers. But for UMAP and the network modeling, we were constrained to use a CPU. However, as stated above, visualizing more than 700 nodes for our graph models was unintepretable. Applying our methods across the entire 23.8 million corpora for UMAP and the network models may yield more meaningful results. Sixth, we were only able to iterate over 15 different LDA models based on changing the number of topics, whereas Syed et al. [26] iterated on 480 models to select coherent models. We believe that applying a manual gridsearch of the LDA parameters such as iterations, alpha, gamma threshold, chunksize, and number of passes would lead to a more diverse representation of LDA models and possibly more coherent topics.",

Second, we found that live White House Coronavirus Briefings led to spikes in Topic 18 (\"potus\"). Third, using UMAP, we found strong local \"clustering\" of topics representing PPE, healthcare workers, and government concerns. UMAP allowed for an improved understanding of distinct topics generated by LDA. Fourth, we used retweets to calculate the speed of retweeting. We found that the median retweeting time was 2.87 hours. Fifth, using directed graphs we plotted the networks of Covid19 retweeting communities from rapid to longer retweeting times. The density of each network increased over time as the number of nodes generally decreased.",

While applying multiple methods for an exploratory strategy, there is no technical guarantee that the same combination of five methods analyzed in this paper will yield insights on a different time period of data. As a result, researchers should attempt multiple techniques and draw on existing literature. Models were calculated using the ruptures Python package. We also applied exponential weighted moving average using the ewm pandas function. We applied a span of 5 for March 24, 2020 and a span of 20 for April 3 -4 datasets, April 5 -6 datasets, and April 8 -9 datasets. Our parameters for binary segmentation included selecting the \"l2\" model to fit the points for Topic 18, using 10 n_bkps (breakpoints). ",
