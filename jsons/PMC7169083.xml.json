Examples of this class of viruses include poliovirus, coxsackievirus, EMCV, HCV, HAV, SARS\u2010CoV, West Nile virus, and dengue fever virus 1. Positive\u2010strand RNA viruses, either enveloped or non\u2010enveloped, consist of a single positive\u2010strand of RNA acting as mRNA to direct the synthesis of viral proteins. Viral structural proteins make up the viral capsid, and non\u2010structural proteins, such as viral proteases and RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerases, function to process the viral polyprotein and catalyze the synthesis of the viral progeny genomes, respectively.",

Among the many host pathways that can be modulated by positive strand RNA viruses, the ubiquitin\u2010proteasome system (UPS), the major intracellular protein degradation pathway, has recently received considerable attention because the interaction between viruses and the UPS has been found to play important roles in many aspects of the viral life cycle 2, 3. For positive\u2010strand RNA viruses, it has been shown that an appropriate stoichiometric ratio of viral structural to non\u2010structural proteins is essential for effective viral replication 4, 5, 6. There is evidence that too much of certain viral non\u2010structural proteins are disadvantageous for certain viruses to successfully replicate 6. To ensure a proper ratio of viral proteins, some positive\u2010strand RNA viruses employ the host regulatory mechanisms, for example, the UPS, to degrade excess viral proteins to prevent interference of these proteins with the viral replication. In addition, post\u2010translational modification of some viral proteins mediated by ubiquitin and ubiquitin\u2010like proteins of the UPS has also been demonstrated as an important means to regulate viral protein function without altering protein stability 2.",

The possibility that UPS\u2010mediated viral protein degradation may also constitute a host defense process against some positive\u2010stranded RNA viral infections will be briefly discussed as well.

            "text": "In eukaryotic cells, the best\u2010known function of the UPS is to degrade misfolded/damaged proteins or intracellular regulatory proteins that are involved in a variety of cellular activities, including cell\u2010cycle regulation, membrane protein trafficking, transcription, antigen presentation, and signal transduction 9, 10. Protein degradation via the UPS starts with the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to a target protein (a process referred to as ubiquitylation) (Figure 1). This process consists of multi\u2010step ATP\u2010dependent enzyme reactions. First, the ubiquitin is activated by ubiquitin\u2010activating enzyme E1 to form an E1\u2010ubiquitin thioester intermediate. The activated ubiquitin is then transferred to a ubiquitin\u2010conjugating enzyme E2 that subsequently transfers the ubiquitin to the target protein either directly or with the help of a ubiquitin ligase enzyme E3 by forming an isopeptide bond between the carboxyl terminus of ubiquitin and the \u03b5\u2010amino group of a lysine residue on the target protein 11. The lysine residue of the conjugated ubiquitin is attached by another ubiquitin, consecutively, resulting in the formation of a poly\u2010ubiquitin chain. The ubiquitin\u2010tagged substrate protein is then delivered to the 20S proteasome, and the polypeptide is hydrolyzed into short oligopeptides and the free ubiquitin is recycled through the action of de\u2010ubiquitinating enzymes 12, 13. De\u2010ubiquitinating enzyme plays important roles in UPS as it proofreads ubiquitin\u2010protein conjugates, processes inactive ubiquitin precursors, and keeps sustainable proteolysis by maintaining sufficient ubiquitin within the cell 14. The 20S proteasome consists of two 7 subunit\u2010composed outer \u03b1\u2010rings and two inner \u03b2\u2010rings. The function of the \u03b1\u2010ring is to translocate the target protein to the core of the \u03b2\u2010rings. The \u03b2\u2010rings possess the catalytic property to conduct the action of the degradation. The 20S proteasome is normally inactive and inaccessible to protein substrates. Proteasome activators (PA), such as PA700 (also known as 19S proteasome), PA28 (also known as REG or 11S proteasome), and PA200, bind and activate the 20S proteasome 15. Although the function of PA200 remains to be fully characterized, PA700 has been shown to mainly mediate ubiquitin\u2010dependent proteasomal degradation, whereas PA28 facilitates substrate degradation in a ubiquitin and ATP\u2010independent manner 15 (Figure 1).",

The best\u2010characterized family of UBL proteins is the small ubiquitin\u2010like modifiers (SUMO), including SUMO\u20101, SUMO\u20102, and SUMO\u20103 18, 19. Protein modification by sumoylation is directed by an enzymatic cascade parallel to that involved in ubiquitylation (Figure 1). SUMO is activated in an ATP\u2010dependent manner by an E1\u2010activating enzyme consisting of a heterodimer of the Aos1 and Uba2 proteins. After activation, SUMO is transferred to the SUMO E2\u2010conjugating enzyme Ubc9. Three classes of SUMO E3\u2010ligases have been reported, RanBP2, PIAS and the Polycomb protein Pc2. The sumoylation target is a lysine that occurs in the consensus motif \u03a8KXE where \u03a8 is a hydrophobic amino acid and X is any residue. Like mono\u2010ubiquitylation, sumoylation does not target proteins for degradation, but instead, regulates protein function and sub\u2010cellular localization 20, 21. A growing body of evidence suggests that sumoylation is particularly important in the regulation of transcription 22. The role of sumoylation in controlling the function of viral proteins by post\u2010translational modification has also been increasingly recognized 18, 23.",

Protein modification by ISG15, termed ISGylation, occurs in a mode similar to ubiquitylation and sumoylation that requires the sequential action of E1 (UBE1L), E2 (UbcH8), and E3 enzymes 24. The process of ISG15 conjugation can be reversed by de\u2010ISGylating enzymes 24. Function of ISGylation has not been fully understood, but it is thought to alter the biological activities of the target proteins or compete for ubiquitylation and play significant roles in many cellular functions 25. Although ISGylation has been mainly associated with host defense response against infection of many viruses, including dengue virus 26, West Nile virus 26, Sindbis virus 27, and Japanese encephalitis virus 28, there were reports that the host ISG15 conjugations system can also be exploited by HCV to facilitate viral production 29, 30, 31. The exact mechanism for the pro\u2010viral function of ISGylation remains unclear; however, it is speculated that ISGylation of HCV proteins or host proteins critical for HCV life\u2010cycle promotes HCV production by altering the function or preventing target proteins from ubiquitin\u2010mediated degradation 31.",

Appropriate balance of viral RdRp concentration in infected cells was found to be a key factor affecting the membrane rearrangements, RNA replication, and RNA recombination efficiencies 33, 34, 35. Transgenic overexpression of the 3D RdRp of the Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus has been shown to have antiviral effects against the infection of this virus itself and other viruses 6, 36. Although the detailed mechanisms remain to be elucidated, changes of the stoichiometry have been proposed to be one mechanism responsible for such antiviral properties of overexpressed 3D 37. These studies imply that maintaining an appropriate level of RdRp is important for viral growth 6. Indeed, the expression levels of RdRp of Sindbis virus, TYMV, HCV, and HAV have been reported to be regulated via UPS\u2010regulated protein proteolysis 5, 19, 38, 39, 40. It was shown that the RNA polymerase (NSP4) of Sindbis virus is degraded by the proteasome through the ubiquitin\u2010dependent N\u2010end rule pathway 38. The N\u2010end rule is a highly conserved degradation mechanism relating the stability of a protein with the nature of its N\u2010terminal residue 41. TYMV RdRp was also shown to be degraded by the proteasome at a late stage of viral infection 5. This UPS\u2010mediated TYMV RdRp degradation requires prerequisite phosphorylation at two residues (threonine\u201064 and serine\u201080) localized within the putative N\u2010terminal PEST sequence (P, proline; E, glutamic acid; S, serine; T, threonine), a known protein degradation motif 19, 42.",

Although the specific E3 ligase responsible for 3D ubiquitylation and the exact ubiquitylation site remain undetermined, this modification appears to be required for its function in regulating transcription of viral genome 44. Besides ubiquitylation, it has also been found that the 3D polymerase of coxsackievirus can be sumoylated with SUMO\u20101, SUMO\u20102, and SUMO\u20103 (unpublished data). DNA alignment reveals one highly conserved sequence Valine\u2010Lysine\u2010Aspartic acid\u2010Glutamic acid (VKDE), which could be found in the 3D of several different species of enteroviral 3D polymerases, that matches the \u03a8KXE consensus motif for sumoylation, suggesting that sumoylation may also be required for the regulation of 3D transcriptional activity.",

The levels of mature 3C protease of EMCV and HAV, both belonging to the picornavirus family, have been found to decrease rapidly after they reach maximum proteolytic activity, about halfway through the infectious cycle 47, 48, 49, 50. It was later demonstrated that low concentrations of 3C in infected cells are largely attributed to increased protein turnover through ubiquitin\u2010mediated proteasome degradation 48, 51, 52, 53. In the presence of proteasome inhibitors, poly\u2010ubiquitinated 3C protein accumulated and the rate of 3C degradation was significantly reduced 48, 52. Evidence also suggests that EMCV and HAV exploit the same ubiquitin enzymes for 3C ubiquitylation as 3C proteases of these two viruses were shown to compete with each other for ubiquitin conjugation 48. Further investigation identified the amino acid sequences 34LLVRGRTLVV43 and 32LGVKDDWLLV41 that serve as the protein destruction signals for recognition and ubiquitylation of EMCV and HAV 3C proteases, respectively, by the host ubiquitin\u2010conjugating system 40, 51, 52, 53. Mutations within these sequences lead to increased stability of 3C proteases.

Moreover, recent evidence revealed a role for PA28\u03b3\u2010mediated and E6AP\u2010mediated degradation of HCV core protein in the regulation of HCV propagation 77.",

The function of HCV F protein remains unclear. Available data suggest a role for F protein in HCV pathogenesis by regulating the expression and activity of several pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines, transcriptional factors, and oncogenes 5, 83, 84. HCV F protein was found to be very labile with a short half\u2010life (~10 min) and degraded by the proteasome 81, 85. Further experimentation revealed that the degradation of F protein is ubiquitin\u2010independent as a lysine\u2010less F protein mutant remains unstable and its protein levels do not appears to be affected in a cell line with a temperature\u2010sensitive E1 82. It was demonstrated that HCV F protein binds to the \u03b13 subunit of the 20S proteasome and is degraded directly by the 20S proteasome in vitro\n82.

In addition to its role in nucleocapsid assembly, the West Nile capsid protein is also involved in viral pathogenesis by inducing apoptosis 88, 89. Overexpression of Makorin ring finger protein 1 has been shown to result in reduced apoptosis triggered by West Nile virus infection, whereas depletion of this protein promotes viral cytotoxicity 86.

Using a yeast two\u2010hybrid system, Ubc9, the E2\u2010conjugating enzyme for sumoylation, was identified as the cellular protein interacting with the SARS\u2010CoV N protein 92. It was further demonstrated that N protein is covalently modified mainly at lysine 62 residue by SUMO 94. Further investigation using wild\u2010type N protein and a sumoylation mutant revealed that sumoylation of this protein increases its homo\u2010oligomerization that may play a role in controlling viral replication cycle 94. Swine fever virus core protein was also found to interact with the intracellular sumoylation pathway 95. It binds to Ubc9 and SUMO\u20101 and disruption of these interactions results in attenuated viral virulence, suggesting a regulatory role of SUMO modification in viral infectivity 95. Dengue virus is a member of the virus family Flaviviridae. Its envelope protein that is responsible for the virus attachment and entry to host cells has been shown to interact directly with SUMO E2 enzyme Ubc9.
