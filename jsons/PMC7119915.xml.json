Additional features include: smooth muscle hypertrophy, metaplasia and hyperplasia of type II pneumocytes, destroyed and disrupted alveolar architecture, traction bronchiectasis and bronchioloectasis, secondary pulmonary hypertensive changes [3]. Histopathological features of UIP are discussed by Drs. Colby and Leslie elsewhere in this book and will not be further addressed here.\n",

Physical examination reveals crackles in >80% of patients with UIP, and clubbing in 20\u201350% [1, 2, 6]. IPF/UIP progresses inexorably over months to years [1, 2, 6]. Extrapulmonary involvement does not occur [6] and should suggest other disorders (particularly CTD-associated pulmonary fibrosis) [12]. However, certain diseases such as ischemic cardiac disease [13, 14], deep venous thrombosis [13], diabetes mellitus [15], and gastroesophageal reflux (GER) [16] are more common in patients with IPF.\n",

Two recent retrospective studies cited circulating antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) in a distinct minority of patients with IPF [18, 19]. None of these serological findings correlate with extent or severity of disease or predict prognosis [2, 6]. However, for new cases of suspected IPF, we obtain serologies for CTD [e.g., ANA and antibodies to SSA, SSB, Scl-70 (scleroderma), Sm, RNP, Jo-1, double stranded DNA] [5, 12, 20] and hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) to rule out those disorders as treatment and prognosis may differ from IPF.",

The factors responsible for this accelerated phase of IPF are unknown, but viral infections, high concentrations of oxygen, or drug reactions are plausible etiologic factors [28, 36].

            "text": "IPF is rare; depending upon criteria used to define IPF, overall rates (per 100,000) range from 14.0 to 42.7 (prevalence) and from 6.8 to 16.3 (incidence) [1, 33, 37, 38]. The incidence of IPF increased progressively in the UK between 1991 and 2003 [38]. Similarly, in the USA, deaths attributed to pulmonary fibrosis increased significantly from 1992 to 2003 (>28% increase) [33]. IPF typically affects older adults, with peak onset after the sixth decade of life; there is a slight male predominance [1, 33, 37, 38]. IPF is more common in current or former smokers [11, 39\u201341]. The incidence of IPF and mortality rates is markedly higher in the elderly. A retrospective study in the USA cited a prevalence (per 100,000) of 4.0 among persons aged 18\u201334 years and 227 among those 75 years or older [37]. In the USA, projected deaths due to IPF (per million) in 2008 were as follows: 18 (ages 45\u201354), 71 (age 55\u201364), 306 (age 65\u201374), 827 (age 75\u201384), 1,380 (age  >  85) [33]. Despite its rarity, IPF accounts for more than 16,000 deaths annually in the USA [33]. Interestingly, mortality rates from IPF exhibit a seasonal variation, with the highest rates in the winter months [42]. In the USA, mortality rates from IPF are climbing more rapidly in women than men [33], possibly reflecting the impact of cigarette smoking. IPF is rare in children [except in kindreds with surfactant protein C (SFPC) mutations] [43].",

A meta-analysis of six case\u2013control studies found six exposures associated with IPF: ever smoking, agriculture farming, livestock, wood dust, metal dust, stone/sand [39]. Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is an occupational disease in coal miners, sandblasters, and workers exposed to asbestos, tungsten carbide, beryllium, and other metals [44], suggesting that at least some cases of \u201cidiopathic\u201d UIP represent pneumoconioses. The considerable variability that exists in the development of pulmonary fibrosis among workers exposed to similar concentrations of fibrogenic/organic dusts implies that genetic factors likely modulate the lung injury [39].",

In a small series of patients with early IPF, aggressive treatment of GER was associated with stabilization or improvement of lung function [45].

Progression of early asymptomatic ILD to symptomatic IPF may occur over a span of decades [40]. An autosomal dominant trait with variable penetrance is suspected in most, but not all, cases [41, 48, 49]. In some patients, genetic polymorphisms for interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) may be important in determining risk [48]. Mutations in SFPC genes have been associated with familial interstitial pneumonitis (FIP) that includes UIP, NSIP, and other histological variants [43]. Further, germ line mutations in the genes encoding telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) and telomerase RNA (hTR) were implicated in dyskeratosis congenita, a rare hereditary disorder associated with pulmonary fibrosis and aplastic anemia [50]. These mutations result in telomere shortening, which has been implicated in age-related disease. Interestingly, older age and smoking also cause telomere shortening [50]. Further, short telomeres were more common in FIP and sporadic IPF compared to controls, even when mutations in hTERT and hTR were lacking [51, 52]. Pulmonary fibrosis may also complicate diverse genetic disorders such as Hermansky\u2013Pudlak syndrome [48], familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia [49], neurofibromatosis [49], etc. IPF occurs in Caucasians and in nonwhites; prevalence among different ethnic groups has not been studied [1]. A retrospective study of IPF in New Zealand cited a lower incidence in those of Maori or Polynesian descent than in those of European descent [53].",

The 2011 guidelines suggest that the presence of four features: subpleural, basally predominant disease; reticular abnormality; honeycombing with or without traction bronchiectasis and the absence of features listed as inconsistent with a UIP pattern allow a definitive diagnosis of a UIP pattern to be made without the need for surgical biopsy [1a]. With advanced disease, distortion, small lung volumes, and pulmonary hypertensive changes may be observed [9]. Zones of emphysema may be found in smokers [9]. Pleural involvement is not found. HC is a key feature discriminating UIP from other interstitial pneumonias [8, 9, 54]. However, CT features of UIP and NSIP overlap, and distinguishing these entities may be difficult [8, 10]. Further, classical CT features of UIP are present in only 37\u201367% of patients with histologically confirmed UIP [8\u201310]. CT scans that are \u201catypical\u201d or \u201cindeterminate\u201d may represent UIP, NSIP, or other histological variants [8, 10].\n",

            "text": "Characteristic physiologic aberrations in UIP include: reduced lung volumes, normal or increased expiratory flow rates, increased forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio, reduced diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), hypoxemia or widened alveolar-arterial paO2 gradient [D(A-aO2)] which is accentuated by exercise, reduced lung compliance, downward and rightward shift of the static expiratory pressure\u2013volume curve, abnormalities on cardiopulmonary exercise tests (CPETs) [2] (Table 10.4). Impairments in gas exchange (i.e., DLCO) and oxygenation may be evident early in the course of the disease, even when spirometry and lung volumes are normal [2]. A restrictive ventilatory defect, with reduced total lung capacity (TLC), is characteristic of IPF, but lung volumes may be normal if emphysema coexists [2]. Lung volumes (e.g., TLC, FVC) are typically higher in smokers (current or former) with IPF compared to nonsmokers [2]. When emphysema coexists, DLCO and oxygenation are disproportionately reduced [2, 55]. CPET demonstrates hypoxemia, widened A-aO2 gradient, submaximal exercise endurance, reduced oxygen consumption (VO2), high respiratory frequency, low tidal volume (V\nT) breathing pattern, increased dead space (V\nD/V\nT), increased minute ventilation for the level of VO2, and a low O2 pulse [56]. Arterial desaturation and abnormal widening of A-aO2 gradient with exercise may be elicited with relatively simple tests, such as the 6-min walk test (6MWT) [57]. Several mechanisms are responsible for exercise-induced desaturation including: ventilation\u2013perfusion (V/Q) mismatching, O2 diffusing limitation, and low mixed venous pO2 [56]. Supplemental O2 during exercise may improve exercise performance and reduce strain to the myocardium. Dyspnea is a cardinal symptom of IPF and profoundly limits exercise performance. Other nonpulmonary factors which limit exercise performance include: deconditioning, peripheral muscle dysfunction, and nutritional status [56].\n",

Advanced age [1, 17, 23, 30, 66] and male gender [1, 23, 29] were associated with a worse prognosis (higher mortality) in most studies. Interestingly, three studies cited improved survival among current or former smokers with UIP compared to never smokers [29, 30, 67]. However, others found no such effect [68, 69]. The apparent \u201cprotective effect\u201d of cigarette smoking may relate to inhibitory effects of cigarette smoke on lung fibroblast proliferation and chemotaxis [2]. A recent study of 249 patients with IPF noted that survival was improved in nonsmokers compared to former or current smokers after adjustment for composite physiologic index (CPI) levels [11]. In that study, current smokers had less severe disease at presentation and represented a \u201chealthy smoker\u201d effect. Interestingly, the concomitant presence of emphysema had no influence on survival. A recent retrospective study from Mexico cited a lower median survival time among patients with IPF and coexistent emphysema compared to IPF without emphysema (25 vs. 34 months, respectively) [55].",

British investigators examined 2-year survival among a cohort of 115 IPF patients awaiting LT [24]. The best predictors of survival (assessed at 2 years) were: DLCO  <  39% predicted and increased fibrosis on HRCT scan [24]. In a separate study by these investigators [66], 106 nonsmokers with IPF were prospectively followed. By univariate analysis, the following parameters predicted survival: age; FEV1; FVC, DLCO, paO2; O2 saturation; HRCT fibrosis score; clearance of inhaled technetium 99m-diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid (99mTc-DTPA) from the lungs (t\n0.5) [66]. By multivariate analysis, the following parameters were independent predictors of survival: (t\n0.5), percent predicted TLC, percent predicted DLCO, age. Inclusion of other PFT or CT scores did not improve the model. Although it is intuitively obvious that severe impairment in PFTs or oxygenation predicts higher mortality, statistical correlations in large patient cohorts are not readily applicable to individual patients.",

Measurement of FVC is less variable than TLC or DLCO [2] and is best suited for serial measurements. Improvement or stability in VC or DLCO with therapy is associated with improved prognosis in patients with IPF [2, 73]. Conversely, deterioration in VC or DLCO at 3 or 6 months, 1 year, or later time points predicts a worse survival [2, 73\u201375]. In a retrospective study, serial PFTs were performed in 80 patients with IPF [73]. By multivariate analysis, >10% decrease in FVC at 6 months was an independent risk factor for mortality (HR, 2.47, p  =  0.006) [73]. Collard et al. evaluated the prognostic value of serial clinical (dyspnea score) and physiologic parameters in 81 patients with IPF [75]. Not surprisingly, survival was worse among patients with deteriorating dyspnea scores or PFTs [FVC% predicted, P(A-aO2)] at 6 or 12 months [75]. British investigators retrospectively reviewed the prognostic significance of histopathologic diagnosis, baseline PFTs, and serial trends in pulmonary functional indices (e.g., FVC, FEV1, DLCO) at 6 and 12 months in 104 patients with IIP (UIP, n  =  63; fibrotic NSIP, n  =  37) [74]. Survival was better in fibrotic NSIP compared with UIP (p  =  0.001) but not in patients with severe functional impairment. Mortality during the first 2 years was linked solely to the severity of functional impairment at presentation (i.e., lower DLCO and FVC levels). The CPI score [72] was the strongest determinant of outcome (p  <  0.001) [74]. At 6 months, serial PFTs and histopathologic diagnosis were prognostically equivalent [74]. However, at 12 months, serial PFT trends (DLCO, FVC, FEV1, CPI) predicted mortality better than any other covariates including histological pattern (all p  <  0.0005). In this context, \u0394DL\nCO provided the best prognostic information (2-year survival); histological pattern provided no additional prognostic value.",

Further, 6-min walk distance (6MWD) correlates with DLCO% predicted [24, 57] and has prognostic value. In one study of IPF patients awaiting LT, survival time was shorter among patients with 6MWD  <  350 m [77]. In a subsequent study of 454 IPF patients awaiting LT, lower 6MWD was associated with increased mortality (assessed at 6 months) and was superior to FVC% predicted as a predictor of mortality [57]. Patients with 6MWD  <  207 m had a more than fourfold greater mortality than those with 6MWD  \u2265  207 m, even after adjustment for demographics, FVC% predicted, pulmonary hypertension, and medical comorbidities [57]. Flaherty et al. assessed the prognostic value of 6MWT in a cohort of 197 patients with IPF [76]. By multivariate analysis, 6MWD was not a reliable predictor of mortality, but the degree of desaturation during 6MWT had greater prognostic value. Patients with O2 saturation  \u2264  88% during their initial 6MWT had a median survival of 3.2 years compared to 6.8 years for those with baseline SaO2  >  88% (p  =  0.006). Recently, a 6-min step test was advocated as another way of assessing exercise capacity and prognosis in patients with IPF or other ILDs [78]. Formal CPET provides additional data including measurement of maximal oxygen uptake (VO2), an integrated measure of respiratory, cardiovascular, and neuromuscular function [56]. Fell et al. evaluated VO2 as a predictor of survival in a cohort of 117 patients with IPF [79]. Patients with baseline VO2  <  8.3 ml/kg/min had an increased risk of death after adjusting for age, smoking status, FVC, and DLCO. Further, VO2 was a stronger predictor than desaturation  <  88% on 6MWT. However VO2 did not predict survival when examined as a continuous variable. However, CPET with arterial cannulation is invasive, logistically difficult, difficult to perform for some patients, and lacks practical value.",

The global extent of disease on CT correlates roughly with severity of functional impairment in IPF [9, 72]. More importantly, the pattern on CT has prognostic value. Three major patterns include: GGOs, reticular or linear pattern, HC [9, 54]. GGO may reflect intra-alveolar or interstitial inflammation, fibrosis, or a combination. Reticular lines reflect fibrosis within alveolar ducts, septa, or spaces, but an inflammatory component may coexist. HC reflects irreversible destruction of alveolar walls and fibrosis [9, 54]. Reticular or \u201choneycomb\u201d patterns predict a low rate of response to therapy [9, 54]. Early studies in patients with IPF (not all of whom had SLB) noted that a pattern of \u201cpredominant GGO\u201d on CT predicted an improved prognosis and responsiveness to therapy when compared to reticular or mixed patterns [9, 54]. However, those sentinel studies may be misleading. Extensive or predominant GGO is rarely found in IPF. Patients exhibiting \u201cpredominant GGO\u201d on CT are more likely to have NSIP than UIP [9, 54], which likely explains the more favorable prognosis in this context.",

A CT-fib score  \u2265  2 in any lobe was highly predictive of UIP (sensitivity, 90%; specificity, 86%). The presence of an interstitial score  \u2265  2 in any lobe was associated with increased mortality [relative risk (RR) of 3.35, p  =  0.02]. The degree of fibrosis of CT is a surrogate marker for the histological pattern of UIP. CT scans that are \u201ctypical of CFA/IPF\u201d were associated with more fibrosis and a higher mortality than \u201catypical\u201d CT scans [9, 54]. In a study of 96 patients with IIP (73 had UIP and 23 had NSIP by SLB), CT scans \u201ccharacteristic of UIP\u201d (i.e., deemed as \u201cdefinite\u201d or \u201cprobable\u201d UIP by experienced radiologists) predicted a worse survival [10]. Among patients with histologically confirmed UIP, mortality was higher when CT features were typical (\u201cdefinite\u201d or \u201cprobable\u201d) UIP compared to those with a nondiagnostic CT (p  =  0.04) [10]. Median survival rates were 2.08 years among patients with both histologic and CT diagnosis of UIP compared to 5.76 years among patients with histologic UIP but atypical CT [10]. CT features of UIP (particularly honeycombing) likely reflect more advanced disease. A recent study retrospectively reviewed CT scans from 98 patients with a histologic diagnosis of UIP [8]. Patterns of CT scans were categorized as: (1) definite UIP, (2) probable UIP, (3) suggestive of alternative diagnosis. Mean survival rates were 45.7, 57.9, and 76.9 months, respectively, median survival rates were 34.8, 43.4, and 112 months, respectively. While these differences between groups did not achieve statistical significance, these data suggest that CT scans interpreted as definite UIP have a worse prognosis. By multivariate analysis, extent of traction bronchiectasis and fibrosis scores influenced prognosis.",

Reticular patterns or HC never regressed whereas GGO improved in 33\u201344% of patients [2, 9, 54]. When global extent of disease lessened on CT, it was due to reduction in the extent of GGO. Importantly, despite early regression of GGO in some patients, GGO usually progresses inexorably to a reticular pattern or HC [2, 9, 54]. Given the potential for fibrosis to evolve over months to years, the value of CT in predicting long-term prognosis is modest. Serial PFTs are more useful than CT scans to document the initial extent of impairment and monitor the course of the disease. Changes in CT are usually concordant with changes in FVC and DLCO [2, 9, 54].",

Subsequently, a modified CRP score (arbitrary total of 100 points) was developed in a cohort of 238 patients with UIP [30]. This modified score incorporated the following variables: age (maximum 25.6 points), smoking history (maximum 13.6 points), clubbing (maximum 10.7 points), percent predicted TLC (maximum 11 points), paO2 at maximal exercise (maximum 10.5 points), changes on chest X-rays (profusion of interstitial opacities or pulmonary hypertension) (maximum 28.6 points) [30]. In addition, an abbreviated CRP score was developed, which excluded paO2 at maximal exercise. Importantly, the modified CRP scores predicted 5-year survival with remarkable accuracy [30]. Five-year survival rates at CRP scores of 20, 40, 60, and 80 points were 89%, 53%, 4%, and <1%, respectively. The abbreviated CRP was less accurate, but more adaptable to clinical practice. These quantitative CRP scoring systems are invaluable for research investigations, but are cumbersome for use in clinical settings.",

            "text": "British investigators developed a CPI incorporating CT and physiologic parameters [72]. The CPI score evaluated disease extent observed by HRCT and selected functional variables (e.g.,% predicted FVC, DLCO, and FEV1). Exercise components were not included in this index. The CPI accounts for coexisting emphysema, which may confound pulmonary functional indexes. In the CPI, both DLCO and FVC were weighted positively [i.e., higher DLCO or FVC resulted in lower (better) CPI scores] whereas the FEV1 is weighted negatively [i.e., a higher FEV1 results in a higher (i.e., worse) CPI score]. Specifically, the formula for CPI was as follows: [extent of disease on CT  =  91.0  \u2212  (0.65  \u00d7  percent predicted DLCO)  \u2212 (0.53  \u00d7  percent predicted FVC)  +  (0.34  \u00d7  percent predicted FEV1)]. CPI correlated more strongly with disease extent on CT than the individual pulmonary functional parameters. More importantly, CPI predicted mortality better than PFTs in all subgroups including 36 patients with UIP on SLB. On univariate analysis, several variables correlated with mortality including: greater extent of disease on CT (p  <  0.0005), greater functional impairment (DLCO, FVC, TLC, FEV1, alveolar volume (VA), paO2, A-aO2 gradient), higher CPI scores (all had p  <  0.0005). When compared with individual pulmonary functional components, CT disease extent was a more powerful predictor of mortality. However, the CPI index was the most powerful index and predicted survival better than the extent of disease on CT or any of the individual PFT components. Further, the CPI was compared to the original [81] or modified [30] CRP scoring systems in 30 patients with UIP who underwent CPET. The CPI was a superior predictor of outcome than the physiologic component of the original CRP score (p  =  0.02) and the physiologic component of the modified CRP score (p  =  0.009). Additional studies using these or similar CRP scoring systems would be of interest.",

Lung FBs isolated from patients with IPF demonstrate greatly enhanced proliferation and production of collagen and ECM [87]. Injury to alveolar ECs and destruction of the subepithelial basement membranes are likely early events in the pathogenesis of IPF [87]. Alveolar ECs exhibit hypertrophy/hyperplasia and ultrastructural alterations in IPF and have the potential to secrete a vast array of cytokines and growth factors [87]. Soluble mediators secreted by cells in the surrounding milieu lead to local recruitment, differentiation, and proliferation of FBs. In this context, for example, transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), and interleukin-8 (IL-8) likely play key roles [87]. These secreted peptides induce leukocyte influx and promote fibrosis. Historically, it was believed that inflammatory leukocytes were the source of these pro-fibrotic cytokines. However, alveolar ECs appear to be the most important source of these cytokines. Stimulation of cytokine production by injured ECs may play a critical role in initiating fibrosis in IPF; the influx of inflammatory leukocytes may be a sequela of EC activation rather than a primary event in the pathogenesis of IPF. The varying degrees of inflammation and fibrosis in the IIPs are likely dependent on, and determined by, local tissue microenvironments that are pathologically altered by a combination of host and environmental factors.",

            "text": "A distinctive feature of IPF/UIP is the so-called fibroblastic foci (FF), often found at the leading edge of normal and fibrotic lung [3]. It has been proposed that FF are a manifestation of ongoing lung injury [3]. Epithelial cell death is most prominent immediately adjacent to FF [3]. Further, FBs and myofibroblasts isolated from patients with IPF induce apoptosis of alveolar ECs in vitro, demonstrate increased production of collagens, increased expression of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), and a relative decrease in collagenases [86, 87]. The combination of excessive production and deposition of ECM proteins and reduced proteolysis of ECM contributes to the fibrotic process in IPF [87]. It has been suggested that FF represent \u201cwound healing\u201d responses to repetitive EC injury, resulting in dysfunctional epithelial\u2013mesenchymal cross-talk [87]. A critical aspect of this dysregulated process is the inability for alveolar ECs to regenerate, re-epithelialize, and form a normal barrier across the alveolar wall [87]. This results in a persistent \u201con-signal,\u201d in part mediated by chemokines, cytokines, and growth factors that activate the underlying mesenchyme. Mesenchymal cells that form FF in IPF are activated and display a contractile phenotype, commonly referred to as myofibroblasts [87]. Myofibroblast differentiation and fate is controlled by soluble growth factors such as TGF-\u03b2 and matrix-derived signals [86, 87]. Under the influence of TGF-\u03b2, myofibroblasts display increased production of collagen, vimentin, \u03b2-actin, and TIMPs [86, 87]. This combination of features leads to a bias towards excessive matrix deposition and wound contraction in IFP. Greater understanding of mechanisms that mediate apoptosis of these cells, a process that has been described in the resolution of cutaneous wound healing [87], may allow development of new therapeutic targets in IPF [86].",

            "text": "Corticosteroids were the mainstay of therapy for more than 4 decades, but are of unproven efficacy and are associated with significant toxicities [2, 23]. Early studies of patients with IPF cited response rates of 10\u201330% with CS (alone or combined with immunosuppressive agents), but complete or sustained remissions were rare [2, 70, 89, 90]. More importantly, many \u201cresponders\u201d likely had IIPs other than UIP (e.g., NSIP, COP, or RBILD/DIP). In recent studies, response rates to CS among patients with histological evidence for UIP were low (0\u201317%) [2]. Large retrospective studies of patients with IPF showed no survival benefit with CS [2, 23, 30]. Given the potential severe toxicities associated with CS, high dose CS should not be used to treat IPF [1]. However, since anecdotal responses to CS are occasionally noted in patients with IPF, the ATS/ERS consensus statement acknowledged that selected patients with clinical or physiological impairment or worsening PFTs should be treated [1]. Among patients requiring treatment, recommended therapy was as follows: oral azathioprine (AZA) or cyclophosphamide (CP) plus low-dose prednisone or prednisolone [0.5 mg/kg (lean body weight per day) for 4 weeks, then 0.25 mg/kg for 8 weeks, then 0.125 mg/kg]. This represents a substantial departure from earlier regimens advocating high-dose prednisone (e.g., \u22651 mg/kg/day for \u22656\u201312 weeks) [70, 89]. Combined therapy should be continued for 6 months in the absence of adverse effects. Treatment should be continued beyond 6 months only if patients improve or remain stable. These recommendations [1] reflect expert opinion, but have not been validated in clinical trials. We believe CS should not be given to patients at high risk for adverse effects (e.g., age  >  70 years, osteoporosis, diabetes mellitus, extreme obesity, etc.)",

In both studies, AZA was combined with prednisone. In the first study, 20 patients with progressive IPF were initially treated with prednisone alone for 3 months [70]. At that point, AZA (3 mg/kg/day) was added and both agents were continued for an additional 9 months or longer. Twelve patients (60%) responded. The independent effect of AZA was difficult to assess since all patients received prednisone concomitantly. In a second, double-blind trial by these investigators, 27 patients with newly diagnosed, previously untreated IPF were randomized to receive AZA (3 mg/kg/day) plus high dose prednisone (n  =  14) or high dose prednisone plus placebo (n  =  13) [89]. At 1 year, PFTs (FVC, DLCO, A-aO2 gradient) were similar between groups. Vital capacity improved (>10% above baseline) in five patients receiving AZA/prednisone and in two patients receiving prednisone/placebo. DLCO improved (>20% above baseline) in three patients receiving AZA/prednisone, and in two receiving prednisone/placebo. Mortality was similar at 1 year (four patients died in each group). At late follow-up (mean 9 years), 43% of AZA-treated patients had died compared to 77% in the prednisone plus placebo cohort. This survival difference was not statistically significant.",

A multicenter RDBPC trial evaluating Bosentan Use in Interstitial Lung Disease (BUILD-1) randomized 158 IPF patients to bosentan or placebo [95]. Patients with severe pulmonary dysfunction (FVC  <  50% predicted or DLCO  <  35% predicted) or concomitant PAH were excluded. At 12 months, 6MWD (the primary endpoint) worsened in both groups (no significant differences between groups). Mean changes from baseline in FVC at 12 months were \u22126.4 and \u22127.7% in the bosentan and placebo groups, respectively. Mean changes from baseline in DLCO at 12 months were \u22124.3 and \u22125.8% in the bosentan and placebo groups, respectively. However, a trend in favor of bosentan was noted in the secondary endpoint [time to death or disease progression, (HR 0.64, p  =  0.12)] [95]. In a larger study (BUILD-3), patients with mild to moderate IPF were randomized to bosentan (n=407) or placebo (n=209) for 12 months [95a]. No significant difference between groups were observed in the primary endpoint (time to IPF worsening or all-cause death).",

Empirical treatment is more attractive when surrogate markers of alveolitis are present (e.g., GGO on CT or BAL lymphocytosis). We offer treatment to selected patients, but only after an honest discussion with the patient and family of the low likelihood of success and the potential for significant adverse effects. For patients desiring treatment, we recommend oral AZA (2 mg/kg/day), either alone or combined with modest doses of prednisone (e.g., 0.5 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks, with gradual taper). We rarely employ CP. Prednisone is tapered to 10 mg daily (or equivalent) within 3 months. We do not recommend CS when specific contraindications or risk factors are present (e.g., obesity, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, age  >  70 years, history of psychiatric illness, poorly controlled hypertension). Unless adverse effects necessitate early discontinuation of therapy, we treat for 6 months and reassess at that point. Treatment is continued only when improvement or stability has been demonstrated by objective tests (e.g., PFTs or CT). Single lung transplantation (SLT) is advised for patients with severe disease or failing medical therapy [96]. Additional novel therapies are being studied (discussed later), but therapeutic efficacy has not yet been shown.",

International Society for Heart and Lung Transplant (ISHLT) Registry data for recipients with IPF cited improved survival with bilateral sequential lung transplantation (BSLT) compared to SLT (p  =  0.03) [98]. Survival rates were similar up to 3 years, but diverged thereafter [98]. Recent data from the ISHLT cited lower survival rates at 3 months post-LT among patients with IPF (84%) or idiopathic PAH (74%) compared to cystic fibrosis (90%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (91%) [99]. Among patients surviving to 1 year, IPF and COPD had the worst long-term survival, most likely reflecting older age and comorbidities [99]. Most deaths following LT are due to chronic allograft rejection or complications of immunosuppressive therapy [99]. Due to a shortage of donor organs, waiting time for LT may be prolonged (up to 2\u20133 years) and many patients with IPF die while awaiting LT [96]. Unless contraindications exist, patients with severe functional impairment (e.g., FVC  <  60% predicted, DLCO  <  40% predicted), oxygen dependency, and a deteriorating course should be listed promptly for transplantation [96].",

A phase II RDBPC trial compared pirfenidone to placebo (2:1 ratio) in a cohort of 107 patients with IPF [102]. The study was stopped prematurely because acute exacerbations were noted in five patients receiving placebo (14%) compared to no cases in the pirfenidone group. The primary endpoint (change in lowest O2 saturation on 6MWT over 6 or 9 months) was not met. There were no significant differences between groups in mortality, TLC, DLCO, or resting paO2. The rate of decline in FVC at 9 months was lower in the pirfenidone group (p  =  0.037), but differences between groups were small and of doubtful clinical significance. In a second Japanese study, 275 patients were randomised to receive either high dose (1800 mg./day), low dose (1200 mg/day) or placebo for 52 weeks. The high dose group had a lower rate of reduction in vital capacity and in the incidence of progression, defined as either death or a decrease of >10% vital capacity, compared with the placebo group [88a]. Pirfenidone has been approved for use in Japan and also in China and India. Two international placebo-controlled RDBPC evaluating pirfenidone as therapy for IPF were recently completed (InterMune, Brisbane, CA) and have been published recently. The primary end point of these two almost identical studies that included 779 patients and that evaluated 2403 mg/day pirfenidone with placebo was change in forced vital capacity over a 72 week period. One of the studies was positive with a magnitude of effect similar to that seen in the Japanese studies. The second study did not reach its primary end point but in this and the positive study, several secondary end point indices were positive, including progression-free survival and change in distance walked in six minutes [88b]. The European Commission has recently granted marketing authorisation for Esbriet (pirfenidone) for the treatment of mild to moderate IPF in the EU.",

Japanese investigators randomized 56 IPF patients to anticoagulants (warfarin) or placebo [104]. Three-year survival and freedom from acute exacerbations were improved in the anticoagulated group. However, dropout rate was high, and selection bias may have influenced the study. Given the risk associated with anticoagulation, additional studies involving greater numbers of patients are required before endorsing this form of therapy. Recently, a placebo-controlled study evaluating warfarin therapy for IPF conducted under the auspices of the IPFnet has been discontinued for lack of efficacy.",

Novel agents that inhibit fibrosis in vitro or in animal models and are worthy of study in future clinical trials include: angiotensin-II antagonists, platelet-activating factor receptor antagonists, inhibitors of leukocyte integrins, cytokines or proteases; agents that block IL-4, IL-12, or TGF\u03b2; imatinib mesylate, sirolimus, keratinocyte growth factor; relaxin; lovastatin; endothelin-1 antagonists; strategies which promote matrix resorption (e.g., by enhancing the activity of MMPs) [86].

(a) Case 1 is a 66-year-old female who presented with cough and mild dyspnea on exertion (DOE) in March 2001. HRCT showed reticulation and honeycomb change (HC) in a peripheral and basilar distribution consistent with IPF. VATS biopsy showed temporally and spatially heterogenous pattern of interstitial fibrosis and chronic inflammation, fibroblastic foci, and focal areas of HC consistent with usual interstitial pneumonitis (UIP). Azathioprine was initiated. She developed marked hypoxemia and worsening PFTs and was listed for lung transplant (LT). Left single LT was performed in April 2007 and she has done well. (b) Case 2 is a 70-year-old male presented in July 2001with mild DOE and cough. HRCT showed reticulation with a subpleural and bibasilar predominance; no ground-glass opacities or HC. PFTs revealed a mild reduction in DLCO but were otherwise normal. Surgical lung biopsy (SLB) in May 2003 demonstrated temporal and spatial heterogeneity, mild chronic inflammation, frequent fibroblastic foci, and HC consistent with UIP. The patient was enrolled in the interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) (Actimune) trial and remained stable. IFN-\u03b3 was discontinued in March 2007. Despite no specific therapy, he remains stable. (c) Case 3 is a 70-year-old male in excellent health who developed moderate DOE in October 2006. HRCT scan showed typical features of UIP. SLB in June 2007 confirmed UIP pattern. Over the next 2 years, exercise capacity worsened despite relatively stable PFTs. In May 2009, he was hospitalized with an acute exacerbation of IPF that was treated with pulse methylprednisolone. Shortly following discharge, he developed another acute exacerbation for which he was rehospitalized. In \u00adhospital, he required high flow oxygen (12 l/min) and was dyspneic at rest. He underwent single LT in July 2009",
