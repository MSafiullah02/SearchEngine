They are RNA\u2010sequence\u2010specific post\u2010transcriptional regulators of gene expression 1. miRNAs are expressed in a wide variety of organisms and originate in the nucleus as primary miRNA transcripts (~1000 nt), which are processed by the dsRNA\u2010specific endonuclease Drosha into precursor miRNAs (pre\u2010miRNA). The pre\u2010miRNA (~70 nt) are transported to the cytoplasm, and further processed by Dicer into mature miRNAs. A single strand of mature miRNA is incorporated into the RNA\u2010induced silencing complex (RISC), which binds to the three prime untranslated region (3\u02b9\u2010UTR) of target mRNA, and exerts direct effects by blocking the translational process or inducing mRNA degradation, and indirect effects by influencing methylation or targeting of transcriptional factors 2, 3. Over 2000 human miRNAs are currently recognized in the comprehensive miRNA database miRBase 4, and the function of many of these miRNAs in various biological processes including differentiation, proliferation, metabolism, and apoptosis is well established 1. It is estimated that about 60% of human genes may be subjected to miRNA regulation. miRNA systems constitute complex combinatorial networks, where one miRNA may regulate many mRNA, and conversely, one mRNA may be regulated by several miRNAs 5.",

Over the past decade, our knowledge of miRNA processes in various biological systems and host\u2013pathogen interactions has rapidly advanced, but the precise role of miRNAs in the host\u2013pathogen interactions is still unclear 10. A number of studies in recent years report differential expression and biological function of miRNAs in airway cells 11, 12. miRNAs play an important role in physiological and pathological aspects of airway cells including pulmonary development, immune function, fibrosis, and cancer 13, 14.

The success of viruses principally depends on their capability to efficiently use the host machinery to take advantage of basic biological processes 16, 17, 18. miRNA systems have several features that make them ideal tools for virus propagation. They are potent post\u2010transcriptional gene expression regulators. They are both small and non\u2010antigenic and can modulate expression of several critical cellular pathways 19, 20, 21. miRNA systems modulate viral replication and pathogenesis in several ways: (i) Host cell miRNAs can positively or negatively affect viral replication and pathogenesis as a result of their biological functions. (ii) Some viruses also encode miRNAs. Current evidence indicates that viral\u2010encoded miRNAs target several cellular genes involved in cell proliferation and survival, stress responses, and anti\u2010viral response. (iii) Virus\u2010encoded miRNAs may also regulate viral gene expression 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27.

Host cellular miRNAs may have direct effects on viral replication, through positive or negative interactions with viral genomes or other viral factors 29. An miRNA system may also contribute to anti\u2010viral host defense 30. Evidence suggests that miRNA can positively or negatively regulate innate and adaptive immune responses 7.

This can enhance virus replication, apparently by down\u2010regulating specific cellular mRNA targets with anti\u2010viral potential 31, 32, 33. Alternatively, viruses may use the miRNA system to limit their own replication in infected cells, allowing evasion of the host immune response, survival of infected cells, establishment of viral latency, and increased spread to other individuals in a population 34. Furthermore, other studies indicate that viral gene products inhibit cellular miRNA expression 35. Thus, viruses can induce certain cellular miRNAs that affect the virus life cycle positively and inhibit those that affect the virus life cycle negatively 29. Interestingly, some viruses can propagate despite the presence of host cell\u2010encoded inhibitory miRNA. Viruses may avoid inhibition by cellular miRNAs by several methods including: (i) blocking cellular miRNA biogenesis; (ii) inhibiting cellular miRNA function; or (iii) evolving 3\u02b9\u2010UTR sequences that miRNAs are unable to bind to because they are not complementary to miRNA, are too short, or have complex secondary structures that could restrict binding by RISCs 36.

In this aspect, HCMV\u2010encoded miRNAs such as miR\u2010UL112\u20101, miR\u2010US5\u20101, and miR\u2010US5\u20102 target multiple components of the host secretory pathways, including VAMP3, RAB5C, RAB11A, SNAP23, and CDC42 132. Additionally, HCMV employs its miRNA repertoire to counter cellular apoptosis and autophagy, particularly the mitochondrial\u2010dependent intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. The pro\u2010apoptotic genes MOAP1, PHAP, and ERN1 are identified as potential targets for miR\u2010UL70\u20103p and miR\u2010UL148D, respectively 133. Finally, a viral intergenetic non\u2010coding RNA element, composed of highly conserved sequences throughout HCMV clinical strains, selectively degrades the cellular miR\u201017 family members of the miR\u201017\u201092 cluster and accelerates virus production 134.",

Complications of acute respiratory tract infection such as pneumonia and sinusitis in young children are associated with HHV\u20106 as is limbic encephalitis following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In addition, HHV\u20106 salivary gland replication and subsequent secretion in saliva is the epidemiologically proven source of transmission 88, 135. As discussed previously, herpesvirus\u2010derived miRNAs play considerable roles in modulating both cellular and viral gene expression, thereby facilitating a suitable environment for productive viral infection and/or latency. Like other human herpesviruses, HHV\u20106 encodes its own miRNAs, promoting efficient viral infection 116, 136. An miRNA encoded by HHV\u20106A (miR\u2010U86) targets the HHV\u20106A IE gene U86, thereby regulating lytic replication, as revealed by growth analyses of mutant viruses (Figure 5) 116. However, HHV\u20106B encodes at least four pre\u2010miRNAs at two positions within the genome in an antisense orientation related to predicted HHV\u20106B\u2010specific genes 136. These data suggest that HHV\u20106, like other herpesviruses, encodes its own miRNAs, but the precise function of these miRNAs in HHV6B requires further investigation.",
