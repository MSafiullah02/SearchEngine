LBV, MOKV, DUVV and SHIBV occur exclusively in Africa. SHIBV was recently isolated from Hipposideros vittatus (formerly known as H. commersoni) [3].

            "text": "The first isolations of MOKV were made in 1968 and 1969 from organ pools of shrews (Crocidura flavescens manni) in Ibadan, Nigeria [5], [6], [7]. The only isolations from humans were in 1968 and 1971 from two girls from Nigeria [6], [8], [9]. However, there were no classical signs of rabies in either of these cases. Whilst the 1968 isolation was made from the cerebrospinal fluid of a girl who presented with fever and convulsions but fully recovered with no neurological damage, the 1971 isolate was from the brain of a girl who died of a poliomyelitis-like encephalitic disease. A further isolation was made in 1974 from a shrew (Crocidura spp.) in Yaounde, Cameroon [10]. The only isolation from a rodent (Lophuromys sikapusi) was in 1981, from Bangui, Central African Republic [11]. MOKV was also isolated from other animal species including companion animals. A survey on lyssaviruses undertaken in Zimbabwe between 1981 and 1984 revealed six isolations of MOKV from domestic animals, namely a dog and cats that had been previously vaccinated against rabies and unvaccinated cats [12], [13]. In 1989 MOKV was isolated from a cat in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia [14]. No further isolation of MOKV was made in Zimbabwe until 1993, when the virus was again isolated from a domestic cat [15]. In the Republic of South Africa, the first isolation was made in 1970 from a domestic cat in Umhlanga Rocks, Kwa-Zulu Natal Province (KZN) [16]. At the time the isolate was assumed to be RABV and the isolate was only identified retrospectively using antigenic typing with monoclonal antibodies during the discovery of MOKV in Zimbabwe in the 1980s [17]. Twenty five years later, in 1995, MOKV was isolated from a domestic cat in South Africa, this time from Mdantsane in the Eastern Cape Province (EC) [17]. Two more isolations followed in 1996, one each in KZN and EC and both from domestic cats of which one was vaccinated against rabies [18], [19]. In 1997 and 1998 three more isolations were made from rabies-vaccinated cats in KZN [18], [19]. Following several years in which MOKV was not encountered, two isolations were from rabies-vaccinated domestic cats in 2006 and 2008 from the EC province and these are the most recent known isolations of this virus [20], [21]. From South Africa all isolations of MOKV were from a domestic cat. Viral RNA was detected by PCR from a domestic dog (in 2005) from Mpumalanga Province of South Africa, virus isolation was unsuccessful in this case [20]. A summary of all MOKV isolates and the approximate geographic location of their origin are presented in Table 1 and Fig. 1. Generally, MOKV infected domestic animals were not observed to be particularly aggressive, but displayed other rabies-like signs that included dehydration, unusual behavior, hypersensitivity, neurological disturbance and salivation [19]. Despite MOKV being isolated from a variety of mammal species, this species is the only lyssavirus never to have been isolated from bats.",

However, no rabies vaccine provided complete protection against MOKV [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32]. More evidence that RABV derived vaccines do not protect against MOKV infection is shown by circumstantial evidence of the fatal infections of numerous domestic animals that had been vaccinated against RABV [13], [18], [19], [20], [21]. Given this scenario and the apparent obscurity of MOKV, we argue that much more information is needed to improve our scant understanding of the epidemiology, disease dynamics and the ecology of this virus.",

Despite these limitations, these studies provided some evidence of the existence of different virus clusters, delineated according to geographical incidence. Generally, the genetic variance was shown to be inversely related to the spatial distribution of isolates. For example, South African MOKV isolates were shown to be closely related, but distinguishable based on province and as a cluster more distant from those made in a neighboring country, Zimbabwe [21], [33], [34]. Such patterns of genetic diversity may indicate extended periods of isolated evolution, as have been reported for terrestrial rabies virus variants [35].

We have shown that most, but not all of the viruses mentioned in literature could be tracked and that some contamination or misnaming occurred. Given a final cohort of eighteen MOKV isolates, the objective of the study was to sequence full nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix (M) and glycoprotein (G) genes. The estimation of viral lineage divergence times and subsequent application of a molecular clock is dependent on an accurate estimation of the rate of nucleotide substitution. Bayesian techniques using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods have been successfully applied to estimate the evolutionary rate and divergence times from dated sequences of RABVs [36], [37], [38], [39], [40]. This study applied a relaxed molecular clock to N-, M-, P- and G-gene datasets to obtain estimates of the time to the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) and rate of evolution for MOKV. The subsequent analysis allowed for study of the phylogeny and diversity within this African lyssavirus species.",

Briefly, TRIzol (Invitrogen) extracted viral RNA was depleted of host genomic DNA using RNase-free DNAse (Qiagen, UK) and host ribosomal RNA was depleted using Terminator 5\u2032-Phosphate-Dependent Exonuclease (Epicentre Biotechnologies). The RNA was fragmented, a random-primed cDNA library was made and run using the Roche 454 GS FLX System. The sequencing data were assembled in the GS de novo assembly software (Roche). The de novo assembled contigs for each isolate were individually aligned using Seqman (DNAStar) using reference sequence EU293117 and/or specific isolate sequences where available. The resulting consensus sequences were used in GS Reference Mapper (Roche) to obtain further sequence reads from the original raw data for each isolate. All four complete genome sequences were obtained, apart from the extremities of the genome (UTRs). The UTRs were inferred from the previously determined MOKV UTR sequences by using RT-PCR primers situated at the beginning and end of the genome (Marston, unpublished).",

For this analysis, an input file for BEAST was generated using the BEAUti programme. For MCMC analysis of the concatenated gene sequence dataset (N, P, M and G genes) partitioning into genes was implemented The analysis utilized the general time reversible model with gamma distribution and proportion of invariable sites (GTR+G+I) with site heterogeneity [43] and population histories were constructed using the Bayesian skyline plot [44]. The relaxed (uncorrelated lognormal) molecular clock was chosen as demographic model. The statistical uncertainty in the data for each parameter estimate is reflected by the value of the 95% highest posterior density (HPD). For each estimate, duplicate BEAST runs were performed to test the reproducibility of the analysis. The BEAST output was assessed using the TRACER programme. For each analysis, a chain length of >30 million steps resulted in an effective sampling size (ESS>200 unless noted), with 10% burn-in removed. Trees and parameters were recorded every 10 000 steps. The trees obtained from BEAST were used as input for the TREEANNOTATOR programme to find the MCC tree.

Given the inherent accuracy of 99.9% of Roche 454 and a sequence depth between 294 and 1006 reads per position the inclusion of sequencing errors are highly unlikely.",

            "text": "Twenty three MOKV isolations and one PCR-based identification have been made to date from six African countries in a period of more than 40 years. Since these African countries are from regions in Africa that are far apart, it is likely that MOKV is present in many others African countries and spread over vast portions of the continent. Moreover, over the past almost 20 years MOKV has only been isolated from South Africa (Fig. 1). Since it is known that MOKV is not only limited to South Africa, the lack of isolation from elsewhere is reflective of the non-existence of appropriate surveillance, including for rabies virus, across Africa. Limited diagnostic capabilities (e.g. typing or sequencing of rabies cases/specimens/isolates) across the continent, remains a key factor. Such enhanced surveillance would likely result in the discovery of more isolates and therefore, a higher diversity of MOKV and would thus improve our understanding of MOKV incidence and circulation. Since rabies vaccines do not offer protection against MOKV, a case can be made for the relative importance of a better understanding of the ecology of MOKV [32]. One of the limiting factors in studying MOKV is the fact that the reservoir species for this virus is not known. Although shrews have been implicated, it remains speculative. Lyssaviruses have a strong association with bats and it seems peculiar that MOKV may be the only exception in this regard - among all the other members of the genus. Indeed, virus neutralizing antibodies (VNA), neutralizing both LBV and MOKV have been detected in sera from frugivorous bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus and Eidolon helvum) [54], [55], [56]. However, belonging to the same phylogroup II, LBV and MOKV have been reported to cross react in serological assays [7], [24], [45], [57]. Since there have been repeated reports of LBV isolations from fruit bats [58], [59], the neutralizing activity of bat sera to MOKV apparently does not confirm the circulation of MOKV in those bat species. However, it cannot be excluded that other yet unidentified African bats may act as reservoir for MOKV. On the other hand, consistent encounters of MOKV in domestic cats and small mammalian species invite speculation along the lines of a prey-to-predator transmission pathway. For MOKV, the estimated MRCA from our study coincides and provides support for the timeframe suggested for the emergence of terrestrial rabies [47]. It is possible that MOKV remained stable in an extant African host environment, while RABV evolution was vastly accelerated given a plethora of host opportunities and global distribution.",
