Nonetheless, there is a nongenomic mechanism that accounts for their notable effectiveness in controlling a vasculitis or SLE crisis. Such nongenomic mechanism includes the antagonism of the C-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) signal pathway-dependent transcription factors and the subsequent block of the JNK signal activation cascade via the inhibition of phosphorylation in serine 63/73 by the glucocorticoid RG31 receptor [34, 35].",

The diagnosis of bacterial arthritis should be considered in any patient with acute monoarticular or oligoarticular arthritis. A widely accepted case definition for bacterial septic arthritis was proposed by Newman and requires one of four points to be met: (1) isolation of an organism from an affected joint, (2) isolation of an organism from another source with a concomitant swollen, hot joint, (3) clinical features and turbid joint fluid in the presence of previous antibiotic therapy, and (4) histologic or radiologic evidence consistent with septic arthritis.",
