In preparation for that scarcity we performed a study to investigate the possibility of reprocessing disposable FFP2 face masks in order to verify their re-usability with a method that could be applied in practice using already available equipment. Therefore single use FFP2 masks (type 1862+3MTM) were sterilized with a 15-minute procedure at 121 \u2070C, using a dry sterilization process as well as with a regular steam process with the masks in sterilization/laminate bags. The effectiveness of these processes are sufficient to inactivate the coronavirus based on knowledge of inactivation of such viruses. [1, 2] A blind comparison of unused sterilized masks was performed with respect to visual inspection, consistency, face fit and breathing resistance. The results of this comparison were that the investigators were unable to distinguish unused new (slightly curved and folded) masks from reprocessed sterilized masks.",

In these experiments it was also observed that the reprocessing procedures of the masks did not appear to affect the water-repellent mask properties.",

Before sterilization, the batches were individually packed in laminate bags and sterilized with steam sterilization by means of 121 \u2070C in Getinge autoclaves and in combination with permeable laminate bags, Halyard type CLFP150X300WI-S20. The autoclaves were activated on a 121 \u2070C program and validated accordingly. After sterilization, the samples were tested at Delft University of Technology and at Reinier de Graaf Hospital, and benchmarked with new mouth masks. A custom test set-up was built to measure the pressure drop over the maskers and outflow with regard to the permeability of the masks. A direct comparison between new and sterilized masks did not show substantial differences. Finally, the filtration capacity of the masks was evaluated using a calibrated Lighthouse Solair 3200 particle counter (Lighthouse, San Francisco). It was shown that the mask permeability of small particles did not change after multiple heat sterilization procedures (Table I\n).",

In case of an acute shortage of FFP2 masks, steam sterilization (e.g. in laminate sterilization wrappings) of used masks at 121 \u2070C in laminated bags, is a simple, useful cost-effective and quick procedure that can be used to make used masks available for safe reuse. The sterilization process of available standard autoclaves in hospitals may have to be adjusted in order to use this sterilization method. We also emphasise that we performed these experiments with 3M masks only. However, our method seems to be a potentially useful way to reuse mouth masks; other hospitals facing a shortage of masks may wish to test and validate this approach to reusing masks.",
