Especially the potential of some of these viral infections to reach pandemic dimensions is a major concern these days [1]. A primary challenge in the development of effective antiviral therapies is the high variability of viral genomes, which makes it easy for them to adapt to new conditions rapidly or to develop resistance against used drugs. This fact demands for a fast and effective drug discovery process. In the past decades, computational techniques like virtual screening have proven to be of great use to make the drug development process faster and less expensive [2]. The applications of virtual screening (VS) in the drug development process against viral targets vary. The first steps of target and lead structure identification as well as further steps like compound development and optimization can be rationalized and improved by VS.",

            "text": "\nIn silico VS uses computational models to describe macromolecule\u2013ligand interactions. A multitude of methods exist for this purpose, which can mainly be categorized into 2D and 3D approaches. Descriptor-based methods (2D methods) rely on the calculation and comparison of scalar molecular properties and aim at identifying molecules that are similar with respect to their calculated molecular attributes. The selection and weighing of descriptors relevant for a certain target binding can be performed using machine-learning techniques, such as neural networks or by linear correlation of measured biological activity (quantitative structure\u2013activity relationships, QSAR) with selected calculated descriptors. Recently, most computational approaches for the discovery of anti-viral compounds rely on 3D methods, which aim to describe the steric and chemical complementarity of the 3D conformations of a macromolecular target and the binding ligand (Fig. 1\n). There are two approaches for developing 3D models: Either from (i) the experimentally determined 3D structure of a disease-relevant macromolecular biological target (structure-based design) or (ii) from a set of ligands, which are supposed to bind to the same target at the same location (ligand-based design). For structure-based design, X-ray crystallography is the main source of information, and the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [4] is an excellent data source for such approaches. Ideally, the binding pocket location is already known, which is the case when a ligand is co-crystallized with the target structure. Ligand-based design, by contrast, is employed for those cases, where no structural information on the target is available. It requires a set of already known biologically active molecules, whose common binding location should be verified experimentally, for example, by mutational studies. This allows the search for novel potential ligands that show a similar 3D overlay either in terms of molecule volume (molecular shape) or in terms of chemical functions (such as hydrogen bond donors, acceptors, lipophilic areas or charges).",

Ligand-based 3D approaches show the same advantage to some extent, because an overlay to known active compounds is provided, which can help in analyzing aspects important for lead optimization.",

There are several docking tools available, which have been reviewed recently [5]. They differ in terms of algorithms used for ligand placement and scoring. These include ligand fragmentation and incremental reconstruction approaches (e.g. FlexX [6]), algorithms based on molecular shape (e.g. DOCK [7], FRED [8]), genetic algorithms (e.g. GOLD [9] and AutoDock [10]), systematic search (e.g. Glide [11]), Monte Carlo optimization (e.g. LigandFit [12]) and surface-based molecular similarity (e.g. Surflex [13]). While ligand placement works reliably for sampling possible ligand binding geometries, scoring functions are not working dependably for all targets [14], mainly due to the impossibility to estimate entropic effects correctly. Nevertheless, manually developed empirical scoring functions tailored for a defined application scope are still useful, and due to the visualization of a binding hypothesis docking remains one of the methods that provides many ideas for rational lead optimization.",

            "text": "3D pharmacophore modeling is based on the concept that a three-dimensional arrangement of chemical features (such as hydrogen bonds, charges, lipophilic areas) forms a pattern that describes the binding of a ligand to a macromolecule. The advantages of pharmacophore models are their easy interpretability and way of modification, which allows researchers to incorporate their knowledge about a specific binding mode into a transparent, but still highly descriptive model. The careful arrangement of chemical feature markers in 3D space to search molecules that fulfill the required interactions is one of the most successful approaches of VS and has led to many success stories for retrospective explanation of ligand affinity and subsequently to prospective ligand design [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. While ligand-based pharmacophore creation has been introduced in the early days of molecular modeling, structure-based 3D pharmacophore design has been introduced more recently: The program LigandScout [21, 22, 23] derives pharmacophores from protein\u2013ligand complexes, interprets ligand geometries, assigns correct hybridization states and applies a set of rules that classifies plausible protein-ligand interactions. For subsequent VS, a computationally efficient pattern-matching algorithm was implemented that allows for geometrically highly accurate VS. Other programs such as catalyst [24], MOE [25] and phase [26] use cascading n-point pharmacophore fingerprints for pharmacophore-molecule superpositioning. The simplicity of 3D pharmacophore representations also means that the complete biophysical nature of drug interactions is not addressed. Understanding the limitations of this approach is essential for its successful application.",

RT is responsible for the retro transcription of RNA to DNA in the first phase of the intracellular viral replication. In an attempt to target this protein, Bustanji et al. selected 2800 fragment-like compounds from the NCI database, performed a high throughput docking and selected the six best hits for testing based on a consensus docking score of which four were found to inhibit RT in biological testing [31]. Similarly, Nichols et al. developed a docking-based VS strategy. They started with the ZINC database [32] and screened the 2 million molecules with the wild-type viral proteins and two clinically relevant RT-mutants. In this study, activities against RT were measured for nine hit compounds and three showed low-micro molar antiviral activity toward either one or both the wild-type and the Y181C mutant HIV-1 strains [33]. Another VS screening was performed to identify novel compounds targeting RT as well as other viral functions associated with RNA transcription. A shape-based screening was applied on the NCI database in a first VS run using dihydroxy benzoyl naphthyl hydrazone, a known RT inhibitor, as query compound. The most active hits identified through this process were employed for a second VS now using a combined ligand-based strategy comprising 3D-, 2D-similarity searches and ligand-based pharmacophore screening. When tested on the RT functions, several of the selected compounds characterized by new scaffolds were shown to inhibit both RT-associated ribonuclease H and RT activities in a low micromolar range [34].",

As for many other viruses RNA pseudoknot formation and the subsequent \u22121 ribosomal frameshift are necessary for the translation of viral proteins. It has been shown that diminished \u22121 ribosomal frameshift causes a decreased production of viral particles, making it a potential target to fight viral infections. In an example of successful VS, Park et al. could identify a compound that binds to the SARS pseudoknot and inhibits \u22121 RF in SARS viruses [54]. For this purpose the 3D structure of the pseudoknot was first computationally modeled. Through a docking-based procedure 58 compounds were selected for biological testing, leading to one potent \u22121 RF inhibitor.",

To avoid this, one strategy is targeting host proteins that are necessary for virus replication but nonessential for the host. Like this, to inhibit the process of HIV entry instead of the viral envelope glycoprotein, the human CXCR4 receptor can also be targeted. Perez-Nueno et al. developed and validated a combined structure- (docking) and a ligand-based (QSAR analyses, pharmacophore modeling and shape matching) VS workflow targeting the CXCR4 receptor. This approach was used to select five virtual hits for synthesis from a database of virtual molecules, which could be validated as inhibitors by biological testing [55].",

Less common are 2D or 3D similarity searches with validated ligands or pharmacophore-based screening. An overview on the percentage of studies applying the respective techniques is shown in Fig. 2\n. Their distinct requirements and features can explain the different frequencies with which the methods are employed. The major advantage of docking for VS is that it can be utilized to screen for compounds acting on a certain protein as soon as one crystal structure exists. This is especially useful in early lead discovery, as at this point only scarce information is accessible. To employ similarity search methods for screening, at least one known ligand must exist. To build a pharmacophore, several known ligands or a crystal structure with co-crystallized ligand are necessary, which makes these methods difficult to employ when little information is available. By contrast, in later drug development stages with more experimental data available, especially 3D pharmacophores can be efficiently used for VS leading to hit compounds with a high structural variability. One main advantage of similarity searches is their efficiency in terms of computational time, especially in comparison to docking which is less suitable for the large-scale virtual screening campaigns. Requirements, advantages and disadvantages of the reported techniques are summarized in Table 1\n. It remains obvious that the drug development process still needs to be improved as it is far from being fast enough to face suddenly appearing viral diseases in an appropriate time scale. Besides, several severe diseases like HIV remain without cure despite high expenses in research. Further efforts have to be made to improve the accuracy of VS methods as well as to improve the quality and availability of experimental data. This can only be achieved by a closer collaboration between experimental and theoretical groups. As mentioned above, promising advances have been made in identifying and targeting host proteins, which could be an option to avoid problems related to viral variability.",
