Second only to abdominal pain and cramps, fever was the second most common chief complaint for patients who came to EDs that year, and the most common chief complaint of patients younger than 15 years. The presence of fever prompts the question of whether antimicrobials should be administered empirically. The survey data also indicate that antimicrobials were the most prescribed drug category, second only to analgesics.1 In EDs around the United States, 7% to 8% of visits involve the administration of at least 1 antimicrobial.2\n",

Patients believe that organisms are becoming resistant to antibiotics in the community, but they have low suspicion that the organisms will affect them or a family member.11 As physicians, our role in patient education and taking responsibility to not overprescribe antibiotics is of the utmost importance.

Since then there has been a steady decline in production; between 2003 and 2007, only 5 new antibiotics were introduced, and since 2007 only 1 new agent has been developed.14 The Pew Health Group identified several challenges to antibiotic innovation. Scientifically, new classes of antibiotic with novel mechanisms of action are difficult to discover. Economically, antibiotics produce lower revenues than other pharmaceuticals. In addition, achieving approval for a new antibiotic from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has become more challenging, because investigators find it difficult to amass a sufficient number of study subjects and regulatory measures are tighter, requiring that the new agent must show improved efficacy and decreased adverse reactions or toxicity.13\n",
