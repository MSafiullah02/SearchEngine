            "text": "Chitosan, a polymer of \u03b2(1-4)-linked glucosamine (2-amino-2-deoxy-O-glucose) units, is a biopolymer with unique characteristics due to the presence of free amino groups on its backbone. It is obtained by partial deacetylation of chitin, which is found in the cell walls of unicellular and filamenous fungi and in extracellular matrices and skeletal deposits of many protozoan and metazoan organisms including algae, choanoflagellates, sponges, corals, cephalopods, and arthropods. Commercially, chitin is extracted from the waste shells of marine crustaceans such as shrimp and crab. A significant proportion is used to produce chitosan, which, in contrast to chitin, is soluble in water at a slightly acidic pH and is easy to modify chemically to increase solubility at neutral pH and to add new functionalities. Chitosan and its derivatives have many desirable properties such as antioxidative and antimicrobial effects, mucoadhesiveness, biodegradability, and biocompatibility and can be manufactured in various formulations including hydrogels, films, membranes, porous sponges, nanoparticles, and nanofibers. Moreover, chitosan is considered a harmless compound, as it has received the generally recognized as safe (GRAS) status by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and it has been approved as a food additive in several Asian countries (No et al. 2007). In the European Union, chitosan is registered as a basic substance, and the use of chitosan hydrochloride is considered by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) as having neither harmful effects on human or animal health nor any negative effects on the environment (European Commission 2014). Therefore, chitosan-based materials have been adopted worldwide in numerous applications in water treatment; food, cosmetic, and textile industry; biosensor engineering; plant protection; pharmaceutical industry; and regenerative medicine. They are used as flocculants, ion exchangers, chelating agents, coating materials, drug carriers, and scaffolds for tissue engineering. During the past years, many companies have started to develop chitosan-based products, and some have already successfully launched them for commercial purposes. This review is intended to summarize recent developments in the use of chitosan-based materials for potential and effective applications in different technical, environmental, agricultural, and biomedical fields.",

            "text": " The mutagenic and carcinogenic Cr(VI) is considered as a dangerous pollutant for humans and marine ecosystems. Composites of chitin and chitosan nano-hydroxyapatite hybrids removed Cr(VI) from aqueous solution by electrostatic interactions and reduction to Cr(III) via electron-donating groups present in the scaffold (Kousalya et al. 2010). A nanocomposite cross-linked hybrid of chitosan-alginate was able to remove Cr(VI) from water waste (Gokila et al. 2017). A more complex scaffold resin, where chitosan was mixed with magnetic particles (Fe3O4), modified by ethylenediamine and stabilized by glutaraldehyde as cross-linker, was established as an effective adsorbent of Cr(VI) (Hu et al. 2011). Reducing toxic Cr(VI) to nontoxic Cr(III) was accomplished by zero-valent iron [Fe(0)] embedded in chitosan beads (Geng et al. 2009). The oxidized iron Fe(III) formed a precipitately complex with Cr(III), thus enabling the regeneration of the adsorbing complex. Another method used ceramic aluminum coated with chitosan to remove Cr(VI) by electrostatic attraction of the hydrogen chromate ions to the positively charged amino groups of chitosan (Boddu et al. 2003).",

Ingenious absorbance methods using a variety of organic and inorganic compounds have been devised to adsorb and remove the toxic ions. Among them are promising measures based on chitosan composite supra-macromolecular structures. Chitosan-based composites with various organic and inorganic compounds were examined as Cu(II) adsorbents. A recyclable complex composed of L-arginine-chitosan-Fe3O4 for removal of Cu(II) ions (Wu et al. 2016) and magnetic cellulose-chitosan composite microspheres was capable to adsorb heavy metals like Cu(II) but also Cd(II) and Pb(II) from aqueous solutions (Peng et al. 2014). Chitosan-algal biomass composite microbeads (Sarg\u0131n et al. 2016b), a binary chitosan/silk fibroin composite (Ramya and Sudha 2013), and cotton fibers functionalized by triethylenetetramine (TETA) and carboxymethyl chitosan form composites and hybrids for adsorption of Cu(II) from water (Niu et al. 2017). Microcapsules composed of phytopathogenic (Ustilago sp.) fungal spores immobilized in cross-linked chitosan matrix (Sarg\u0131n et al. 2016a) and a binary complex of chitosan and emu egg shells (Anantha and Kota 2016) were shown to remove copper ions from aqueous solutions.",

Laboratory research including adsorption by chitosan-based composites has been high on the agenda (Amouzgar and Salamatinia 2015). Zhang et al. (2014) used a rather simple cross-linked magnetic chitosan-Fe3O4 composite to examine the sorption of three pharmaceutical compounds from contaminated water. The absorbance analysis showed effective sorption of diclofenac (a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) and clofibric acid (an antilipemic agent) but not of carbamazepine (an antiepileptic medication). Pharmaceuticals in water can be present as cationic, anionic, and neutral forms at different pH values. Thus, Zhang et al. (2016) in a more recent study devised an innovative, more complex three-dimensional chitosan-based scaffold. A magnetic core of chitosan-Fe3O4 was grafted with polymeric arms of either the polycation [poly(2-methyl acryoxyethyl trimethyl ammonium chloride], the polyanion poly(acrylic acid), or the neutral polymer poly(methylmethacrylate). The polycationic extension was cost-effective in removal of diclofenac from water due to charge attraction (Zhang et al. 2016). Further, magnetic composite pellets with grafted clay ( bentonite) and activated carbon were prepared to examine possible cost-effective removal of cationic and anionic pharmaceuticals (Arya and Philip 2016). The composite was effective as a sorbent for the beta-blocker ( atenolol), the antibiotic ( ciprofloxacin), and the lipid regulator ( gemfibrozil).",

Basically, the biosensors\u2019 constructs consist of a biological sensing element associated and intimately interfaced with a transducer that converts a signal in one form of energy to a signal of another form. Such signals should be proportional to the amount of analyte within a certain concentration range. Electrochemical biosensor devices, for example, possess advantages as being simple and relatively cheap while offering rapid detection and high sensitivity and further being amenable to miniaturization. Biosensors have been developed not only as analytical tools for medical purposes of clinical detection but also for applications in food industry and environmental monitoring.",

The polysaccharides are biocompatible, have functional groups pliable to chemical modification, and can be easily deposited on the surface of the transducer as adhesive thin films for the immobilization of recognition elements (enzymes, antibodies, DNA, whole cells, and cell organelles). Addition of carbon tubes, graphite, and graphene oxide to the composite increases electron transfer to the transducer and enhanced mechanical strength as well as water permeability and retention. Since there is a vast array of biosensors based on chitosan in their constructs, the following provide only representative devices.",

An amperometric glucose biosensor composed of multilayered chitosan biofilms-gold nanoparticles-glucose oxidase on platinum (Pt) electrode was devised (Wu et al. 2007).

(2013) devised an electrochemical DNA biosensor to detect typhoid which was constructed by surface immobilizing Salmonella typhi single-stranded (ss) DNA on graphene oxide/chitosan/ITO nanocomposite as a bioelectrode. The biosensor was capable of distinguishing between complementary, noncomplementary, and one base mismatch sequences. A similar electrochemical DNA biosensor was developed for the detection of 0157:H7 (Xu et al. 2017b). It was prepared with immobilized E. coli ss-DNA using a graphene oxide/chitosan hybrid nanocomposite. An electrochemical immunobiosensor to detect botulism neurotoxin A was reported by Afkhami et al. (2017). The sensor consisted of a gold nanoparticles/chitosan/graphene nanocomposite with immobilized antibodies to quantify the bound neurotoxin. To detect \u03b1-fetoprotein in human serum, an immunosensor was fabricated in which the \u03b1-fetoprotein antigen was immobilized on a film of a gold nanoparticles/ carbon nanotubes/chitosan nanocomplex to quantify protein levels using a competitive immunoassay format (Lin et al. 2009). Giannetto et al. (2017) fabricated a competitive electrochemical immunosensor to detect HIV1-related capsid protein p24 in human serum. The p24 antigen was immobilized on gold-free single-walled carbon nanotube-chitosan complex for the interaction with a mouse monoclonal anti-p24, which was used for competitive immunodetection. Liu et al. (2009) developed an immunosensor to detect carcinoembryonic antigen, which is based on corresponding antibodies immobilized on chitosan-gold nanoparticles. Finally, Qiu et al. (2009) reported an immunosensor to detect hepatitis B surface antigen, which was constructed on the basis of a gold nanoparticles/chitosan/ferrocene biofilm with immobilized hepatitis B antibodies.",

            "text": "There are several comprehensive reviews that summarize the potential use of chitosan, its derivatives, and chitooligosaccharides in agriculture as related to their broad-spectrum antimicrobial and antioxidant activities (Aider 2010; Cota-Arriola et al. 2013; Li et al. 2013a; Xing et al. 2015; Liaqat and Eltem 2018). Such beneficial activities were demonstrated in a variety of agricultural products like preservation of vegetables, fruits, cereals, dairy products, eggs, meat, and seafood (No et al. 2007; Friedman and Juneja 2010). Chitosan per se has antimicrobial activity that depends on higher degree of deacetylation, low molecular weight (its oligosaccharides), increased protonation at low pH, and the type of microorganisms (Katiyar et al. 2014). The antimicrobial efficiency is enhanced by adding essential oils (extracted from lemon, lemon grass, cinnamon, or rosemary) (Duan and Zhang 2013; Xing et al. 2016; Yuan et al. 2016) or by adding metal ions like silver or copper (An et al. 2011; Brunel et al. 2013; Kumar-Krishnan et al. 2015; Choudhary et al. 2017a; Sharma 2017) particularly to chitosan-based nanoparticles (Friedman and Juneja 2010; Cota-Arriola et al. 2013). The mode of action is mainly attributed to electrochemical interactions between the positively charged chitosan and the negative surface charge of bacterial cells leading to membranes disruption (Xing et al. 2015). In addition, penetration and binding of nanochitosan with microbial DNA that impact mRNA and protein synthesis were proposed (Rabea et al. 2003, Malerba and Cerana 2016).",

Such activation engages different signal transduction pathways that involve a variety of second messengers. Other defense responses include pathogenesis-related proteins, phytoalexins, proteinase inhibitors, lignin synthesis, or callose formation (El Hadrami et al. 2010; Hadwiger 2013). Induction of programmed cell death and hypersensitivity-associated responses by chitosan and chitooligosaccharides was documented (Zuppini et al. 2004; Vasil\u00eav et al. 2009; Zhang et al. 2012), as well as activation of plant defense genes via the octadecanoid pathway leading to jasmonate synthesis (Doares et al. 1995; Rakwal et al. 2002). Chitosan induces hydrolase enzymes such as chitinase and \u03b2-1,3 glucanase able to destroy chitin/glucan-containing fungal cell walls (Ma et al. 2013b; Xing et al. 2015).",

Likewise, composites of chitosan with a variety of clays (montmorillonite, attapulgite, bentonite, and kaolinite), safe anionic dyes ( Fast Green and Naphthol Yellow S), and photo-stabilized fungal conidia of the insect biocontrol agent Aschersonia spp. were reported (Cohen et al. 2003). Chitosan composites were found to be useful carriers of herbicides facilitating soil sorption as in the case of paraquat associated with chitosan-alginate nanoparticles (Silva Mdos et al. 2011) or slow release of paraquat encapsulated in tripolyphosphate-generated chitosan nanoparticles (Grillo et al. 2014). Moreover, encapsulation of metolachlor in blended gel beads of cross-linked carboxymethyl cellulose and carboxymethyl chitosan was effective in slow release of the herbicide as a model compound (Dong et al. 2012). Finally, slow release of atrazine encapsulated in carboxymethyl chitosan/bentonite gel was demonstrated (Li et al. 2012a).",

Bhaskara Reddy et al. (1999) demonstrated induced resistance to seed-borne followed by improved germination and vigor in wheat seeds coated with chitosan. Soybean seeds coated by chitosan had anti-feeding effects and protected against several insect pests (Zeng et al. 2012), and coating rice seeds increased antifungal effect, stimulated seeding growth, improved root system, and increased crop yield (Zeng and Shi 2009). Tomato seeds coated with chitosan resulted in resistance to infection by inducing plant defense mechanisms (Benhamou et al. 1994). Chickpea seeds treated with chitosan-silver nanoparticles promoted germination and increased biomass, chlorophyll, carotenoids, and protein contents as well as amylase activity and defense enzyme activities (Anusuya and Banu 2016). Similar effects were demonstrated in maize seeds coated with Cu/chitosan nanoparticles (Saharan et al. 2016; Choudhary et al. 2017b).",

Chitosan with added compounds such as plant materials and animal proteins (formulations of chitosan with additions of tapioca starch, hydroxypropyl cellulose, pectin, and fish gelatin) was used to develop edible films. Such films in addition to their antimicrobial and antioxidant activities also keep food products from loss of moisture and oxygen penetration (Aider 2010; Duan and Zhang 2013). Postharvest coating of vegetables and fruits with chitosan and additional essential oils (extracts from lemon, rosemary, lemon grass, bergamont, cinnamon, oregano, and thymine), which by themselves exert antimicrobial and antioxidant activities, improved storage quality and prolonged the shelf life of products (Xing et al. 2016). Controlling postharvest decay during storage was reported also for additives such as olive oil, glacial acetic acid, green tea extract, and lactic acid (Xing et al. 2016; Yuan et al. 2016).",

Using appropriate food packaging materials with antimicrobial properties may prevent or at least slow down bacterial and fungal growth. For this reason, a variety of biopolymers has been tested to identify alternative materials to the classical nondegradable plastic packaging materials, which have caused serious environmental issues due to their inappropriate disposal. Optimal alternative materials should be environmentally safe due to biodegradability and biocompatibility. As chitosan-based material combine antimicrobial properties with biodegradability and biocompatibility, they are the focus of research in food packaging. Moreover, chitosan-based materials have food-preserving antioxidant activity and film-forming ability, which allows the production of transparent foils and bags. Different methods have been established during the past decades to fabricate chitosan films including casting, coating, extrusion, and layer-by-layer synthesis, and the resulting materials have been evaluated for their antimicrobial and antioxidant activity and for their optical, mechanical, barrier, and thermal characteristics. Chitosan has also been combined with other functional materials resulting in composite films with tremendous preservative properties that can be utilized for the packaging of different foods such as vegetables, fruit, and meat. For a comprehensive overview on this topic, the reader is referred to an excellent review article published recently by Wang et al. (2018).",

In addition, chitosan nanofibers have been fabricated as a packaging material and tested for their antimicrobial activity. For instance, Arkoun et al. (2017) examined the antimicrobial activity of chitosan/polyethylene oxide nanofibers produced by an electrospinning process. They showed that the chitosan nanofibers were efficient in inhibiting growth of E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Lysteria innocua, and S. typhimurium, however at pH 5.8, which was below the pKa of chitosan, limiting the applicability to slightly acidic food. Importantly, the authors demonstrated that the antibacterial effects were irreversible, suggesting a bactericidal rather than bacteriostatic mechanism.",

These biopolymers comprise of cellulose and various cellulose derivatives, alginate, cyclodextrin, glucan, mannan, pectin, starch, and xylan. Chitosan/cellulose films revealed improved mechanical properties while maintaining excellent antimicrobial properties (Xiao et al. 2013). Also chitosan/hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HMPC) films exhibit significant antimicrobial activity. For instance, M\u00f6ller et al. (2004) examined the antimicrobial effects of chitosan/HPMC films against Listeria monocytogenes and found that bacterial growth was completely inhibited on the film. Similarly, chitosan/ carboxymethyl cellulose films showed superb food preservation properties when tested on packaged cheese (Youssef et al. 2016). Antimicrobial chitosan-alginate films have a great potential for food packaging as well, particularly because they show improved gas exchange and water vapor permeability properties when prepared by a layer-by-layer electrostatic deposition approach (Poverenov et al. 2014a). Marti\u00f1on et al. (2014) studied the effectiveness of antimicrobial multilayered coatings consisting of chitosan, pectin, and trans-cinnamaldehyde at different concentrations to extend the shelf life of fresh-cut cantaloupe and found that certain compositions were effective in preventing bacterial growth and spoilage. Lorevice et al. (2016) produced chitosan nanoparticles and combined them with different methyl pectin matrices to generate nanocomposite films and tested the mechanical, thermal, and barrier properties. The results showed that the nanocomposite film improved mechanical characteristics when compared with conventionally produced pectin films, making these novel materials promising for food packaging production. Similarly, chitosan/cyclodextrin films with inclusions of essential oil have been reported to possess desirable mechanical properties for food packaging (Sun et al. 2014). Moreover, this material showed significant antimicrobial activities against a variety of pathogenic bacteria.",

The films were made of chitosan, allyl isothiocyanide, and barley straw arabinoxylan, which were used as film-forming, antimicrobial, and emulsifying agents, respectively.

(2014) produced chitosan-silver and chitosan-gold (CS-Au) nanocomposites films, which showed enhanced antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive (S. aureus) and Gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aerugenosa), fungi (Aspergillus niger), and yeast (Candida albicans) . In another study published by Al-Naamani et al. (2016), poly(ethylene) films were coated with zinc oxide/chitosan nanocomposite, which completely inactivated and prevented the growth of food pathogens. In an approach based on a solution cast method, Sanuja et al. (2015) fabricated a chitosan-based nanocomposite film using nano zinc oxide and neem essential oil, which improved mechanical, physical, barrier, and optical properties. Moreover, Zhang et al. (2017) prepared chitosan/titanium dioxide composite films, which were found to possess significant antimicrobial activity against E. coli, S. aureus, C. albicans, and A. niger. Xu et al. (2017c) employed a different strategy by synthesizing chitosan/ graphene oxide nanocomposites with titanium dioxide and analyzed their antimicrobial and food-preserving efficacies. They showed that the material effectively prevented and A. niger biofilm formation presumably by disrupting cellular membranes. In addition, they demonstrated that the nano-coating could be applied as a cling film, which delays loss of moisture in fruits and vegetables and inhibits polyphenol oxidase activity and thus enzymatic browning but increases superoxide dismutase activity, which protects against reactive oxygen species. Next to these materials, chitosan-montmorillonite composites, chitosan/nanosilica films, and manifold combinations of chitin, metals, and minerals have been tested. In addition, numerous chemical chitosan derivatives have been explored for their properties to screen for new films suitable in food packaging. These derivatives include carboxymethyl chitosan and quaternized chitosan such as (2-N-Hydroxypropyl-3-trimethylammonium chloride) chitosan (Hu et al. 2016).",

For example, a blend of chitosan (short fibers) with cotton (long fibers) yarn by spinning technology is desirable for medical applications (Lam et al. 2017). Gauze bandages for wound dressing were prepared by electrospinning of chitosan nanofibers and cotton fabric (Nawalakhe et al. 2015). Plasma treatment was applied to improve adhesion by increased cross-linking between the two fiber systems imparting subsequent durability (Nawalakhe et al. 2015). Pure chitosan microfibers produced by wet spinning process was aimed for possible stable 3-D scaffold woven or nonwoven textile fabrics to be used in regenerative medicine such as bone and cartilage engineering (Toskas et al. 2013). Lam et al. (2018) examined a blend of chitin fibrils with cotton jersey fabric and showed reduced rigidity that may provide comfort to patients with epidermolysis bullosa skin disease. Likewise, chitosan-coated textile fabrics improved atopic dermatitis disease by restraining skin microbiome (Lopes et al. 2015). Sonochemical deposition was used by Petkova et al. (2014) to coat cotton fabrics with a hybrid of chitosan and ZnO nanoparticles. This complex showed improved antibacterial activity, slow release of the metal and washing stability, and postulated as effective treatment for hospital textiles to prevent transfer of pathogens. Similarly, the hybrid of chitosan and silver nanoparticles deposited onto cotton fabric demonstrated antibacterial effects and laundry durability befitting their possible use for medical textiles and sportswear (Xu et al. 2016). Ali et al. (2011) proposed to use chitosan nanoparticles that are able to pick and retain silver ions in medical textile applications. A polyester fabric coated with this complex hybrid imparted enhanced antibacterial activity. Nanonized chitosan applied onto cotton exhibited in addition to antibacterial activity, also thermal stability, UV protection as well as improved dye-ability (Hebeish et al. 2013).",

Aging of the skin, viewed as wrinkling, dryness, loss of elasticity, dehydration, and hyperpigmentation, is the result of long-term exposure to sunlight UV, which mainly forms reactive oxygen species. Protection from photoaging is a major drive in the cosmetic industry. For example, chitooligosaccharides per se were able to protect UV-irradiated hairless mouse skin from photoaging damage (Kong et al. 2018). Gel formulation of chitosan microparticles served as a delivery system for the sustained release of the hydrophilic sunscreen, phenylbenzimidazole sulphonic acid (Gomaa et al. 2010). The cosmetic gel formulation of blended chitosan, collagen, and , with antibacterial and antioxidant effects, proved useful in the regeneration and rejuvenation of the skin using cultured mouse fibroblast (Rajashree and Rose 2017). Microspheres composed of carboxymethyl chitosan/collagen peptides-calcium chloride protected mice skin and thymus lymphocytes from UV-B radiation damage (Liu et al. 2015b). A cosmetic cream formulation composed of quaternized carboxymethyl chitosan-montmorillonite nanocomposite bestowed good UV protection and additional moisturizing and water retention effects (Chen et al. 2017). There is a possible cosmetic use of neutralized chitosan in citrate buffer film for skin exfoliation (Libio et al. 2016).",

They can adhere to the negatively charged hair keratin forming a transparent elastic film that covers hair fibers endowing smoothness, softness, and also mechanical strength (Dutta et al. 2004). A blend of chitosan and two other biopolymers like collagen and hyaluronic acid that forms a thin film over hair surface provides enhanced mechanical strength and improved conditioning of the treated hair (Sionkowska et al. 2017).

Tablets are probably the most favorable and accurate dosage form, which are moreover easy to fabricate and handle. A simple method for their production is homogenization of the drug and chitosan and compressing the resulting mixture to tablets. However, it has to be considered that due to the alkaline conditions in the distal intestine, drug absorption is restricted to the more proximal regions of the gastrointestinal tract when pure chitosan is used which precipitates at an alkaline pH (Sakkinen et al. 2004; Dhaliwal et al. 2008). Therefore, more pH-insensitive formulations using higher-charged chitosan derivatives such as trimethylated chitosans or thiolated chitosan conjugates have improved absorption properties along the gastrointestinal tract. Although there is still a lack of robust data in human volunteers, some studies indicate that tablet formulations using higher-charged chitosan derivatives increase bioavailability due to improved mucoadhesiveness and better protection of the drug from degrading enzymes (van der Merwe et al. 2004). Chitosan-based tablets have been also examined for their use in vaginal drug delivery, mainly as carriers for antiviral and antifungal therapeutics (El-Kamel et al. 2002; Senyigit et al. 2014; Frank et al. 2017). However, the antimicrobial properties of chitosan may negatively affect the vaginal microflora, and hence long-term treatment should be critically evaluated (Raafat and Sahl 2009).",

Notably, chitosan-coated lipid micro- and nanoparticles have been developed for nose-to-brain delivery of a variety of therapeutic drugs (Casettari and Illum 2014; Sarvaiya and Agrawal 2015). Chitosan-based nanoparticles are also a promising carrier for buccal drug delivery, which has the advantage of avoiding the hepatic first-pass metabolism and degradation in the gastrointestinal system (Sandri et al. 2005). Polymeric carriers generally have the potential advantage of prolonged release times of low-molecular-weight drugs. Because chitosan is additionally susceptible to hydrolysis by lysozyme in the blood serum, which facilitates drug release, and exhibits no toxic or hemolytic effects when applied parenteral (Nordtveit et al. 1994; Richardson et al. 1999), chitosan-based formulations are also suitable carriers for controlled drug release when administered by intravenous injection (Thanoo et al. 1992).",

            "text": "Conventional chemotherapeutics are frequently not very effective in reaching the tumor cells, as solid tumors are not well supplied with blood, and lack lymphatic vessels, which results in and decreased convective flow in the interstitial fluid. To overcome these problems, novel drug delivery systems have been designed. These carriers are capable of encapsulating high concentrations of the cytotoxic compound within a macromolecular matrix that specifically targets the cargo to the tumor cells where the drugs are finally released in a controlled manner. This concept profits from the EPR (enhanced permeability and retention) effect, the phenomenon that macromolecules preferentially accumulate in solid tumors, probably because they have a defective vasculature and lack effective lymphatic drainage (Matsumura and Maeda 1986). Chitosan-based nanoparticles have many properties that make them suitable carriers for anticancer drugs. Next to their great chemical flexibility, allowing the design of selective carriers, chitosan-based materials evidently exhibit also the EPR effect depending on the tumor microenvironment (Yhee et al. 2017). Moreover, they are degraded inside the body into fragments which can be cleared by the kidney (Kean and Thanou 2010), and several studies suggested that chitosan itself has antitumor effects (Qi and Xu 2006; Yao et al. 2013a), making this polymer a highly suitable supplementary antitumor drug and drug carrier. Indeed, chitosan-based nanocomposites can be used to deliver hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs such as doxorubicin hydrochloride and paclitaxel, respectively (Kim et al. 2006; Yousefpour et al. 2011). Studies analyzing chitosan-based drug delivery systems for cancer treatment are summarized in Table 14.2.",

            "text": "To target tumor cells by the EPR effect passively, Mitra et al. (2001) fabricated chitosan-based nanoparticles of about 100 nm carrying a dextran-doxorubicin conjugate and examined the antitumor effects in vivo in macrophage tumor cells implanted into BALB/c mice. The authors observed an improved therapeutic efficacy of dextran-doxorubicin loaded chitosan nanoparticles, which is probably due to the prolonged circulation time and/or drug accumulation at the tumor sites. In another study published by Yousefpour et al. (2011), doxorubicin was conjugated to chitosan using succinic anhydride as a cross-linker. In a second step, the resulting self-assembled chitosan-doxorubicin conjugate nanoparticles were conjugated with trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody to the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2+ (Her2+), via lysine thiolation and subsequent linking of the derived thiols to chitosan. The Trastuzumab conjugated chitosan-doxorubicin nanoparticles selectively targeted Her2+ cancer cells resulting in enhanced uptake when compared to chitosan-doxorubicin particles and the free drugs. In another study, pluronic F127, a block copolymer of hydrophobic polyoxypropylene flanked by two chains of hydrophilic polyoxyethylene, was grafted onto chitosan to generate a copolymer micelle that can encapsulate doxorubicin (Naruphontjirakul and Viravaidya-Pasuwat 2011). The resulting chitosan-pluronic micelles carrying doxorubicin showed a high drug loading capacity and revealed a higher cytotoxic activity to MCF7 breast cancer cell lines in vitro than the free drug. Another approach to deliver doxorubicin specifically to cancer cells was reported by Varshosaz et al. (2016). The research team fabricated dual targeted nanoparticles loaded with doxorubicin and magnetic nanoparticles to treat breast cancer. For this purpose, the nanoparticles were produced via a layer-by-layer technique and functionalized with a bioconjugate of chitosan/poly(methyl vinyl ether maleic acid) and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) to target corresponding receptors on the surface of MCF7 breast cancer cells, which presumably take up the particles by endocytosis. The targeted nanoparticles increased the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin about twofold in LHRH-positive cancer cells. In a similar approach, folate-grafted chitosan-coated magnetic nanoparticles were loaded with doxorubicin to target human glioblastoma U87 cells in athymic BALB/c nude mice in a subcutaneous tumor model system (Yang et al. 2017). Guiding the injected nanoparticles to the tumor by a magnetic field significantly decreased tumor growth by controlled delivery of doxorubicin to the cancer cells and demonstrated the feasibility of magnetic nanoparticles to direct the localization of drug release. Mesoporous aluminosilicate zeolite (ZSM-5) chitosan core-shell nanodisks loaded with doxorubicin were used as pH-responsive drug delivery systems against osteosarcoma that release the drug after upon endosomal acidification (Yang et al. 2018). Recently, Radmansouri et al. (2018) showed that doxorubicin-loaded electrospun chitosan/cobalt ferrite/titanium oxide nanofibers could be used for localized melanoma cancer therapy. The fastest release of doxorubicin from prepared magnetic nanofibers was observed at acidic pH when an alternating magnetic field was applied. As mentioned above, chitosan-based nanoparticles can also be modified to carry hydrophobic drugs such as paclitaxel. For this purpose, hydrophobic side chains are grafted onto chitosan. For instance, Kim et al. (2006) used glycol chitosan nanoparticles that were hydrophobically modified with \u03b2-cholanic acid and incorporated paclitaxel. The resulting nanoparticles showed sustained drug release, and following injection into the tail vein of tumor-bearing mice, tumor growth was impaired. In a subsequent study, the same research team used this system as carrier for cisplatin, which is also poorly soluble in water. The hydrophobically modified glycol chitosan nanoparticles loaded with cisplatin exhibited the EPR effect, as they accumulated in solid tumors, and was proven to have a high antitumor efficacy in a tumor-bearing mice model (Kim et al. 2008). Paclitaxel was also encapsulated in chitosan-containing glyceryl monooleate core-shell nanoparticles, which were generated by the emulsification/evaporation technique (Trickler et al. 2008). Using this drug delivery system, the authors observed a 1000-fold increase in cytotoxicity, when determining the IC50 values in a human breast cancer cell line. Another common hydrophobic anticancer drug is 5-fluorouracil, which has been widely used to treat different kinds of solid tumors. In a study by Zheng et al. (2007), polyelectrolyte nanoparticles based on chitosan and polyaspartic acid sodium salt were used to encapsulate 5-fluorouracil testing various conditions for nanoparticle preparation such as temperature, ionic strength, pH and cross-linker concentration, and different loading methods. The optimized nanoparticles showed sustained drug release in vitro and in vivo. Rajan et al. (2013) prepared hyaluronidase-5-fluoruracil-loaded chitosan-polyethylenglycol-gelatin copolymers as a targeted drug delivery system and examined particle size, distribution, morphology, and drug loading capacity. The nanoparticles showed less cytotoxicity than free 5-fluorouracil when applied to colon cancer cells for a few hours. Another approach for controlled drug delivery used molecular surface imprinted graft copolymer of chitosan with methyl methacrylate, which was prepared by free-radical polymerization with 5-fluorouracil as template molecule (Zheng et al. 2016). The pH dependency and the kinetics of drug release suggested that this chitosan-based carrier is optimal for orally applied colon-specific drug delivery. A similar strategy to achieve colon specificity was used recently by Bashir et al. (2017). They synthesized pH-responsive semi-interpenetrating network hydrogels of N-succinyl-chitosan via Schiff base mechanism using glutaraldehyde as a cross-linking agent and embedded poly(acrylamide-co-acrylic acid). The hydrogel exhibited a porous structure and pH-dependent swelling properties. The hydrogel was effectively loaded with 5-fluorouracil, and the determined drug release was pH-dependent as well, with high release rates at pH 7.4 and low rates at pH 1.2.",

For this purpose, chitosan shells coated on magnetic nanoparticles were loaded with both drugs and entrapped into poly(lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles conjugated with a cyclo(Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Phe-Lys) (cRGD) peptide targeting \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin, which is highly expressed on activated endothelial cells of newborn vessels during tumor angiogenesis as well as in some tumor cells (Liu et al. 2008). Near-infrared laser irradiation was sufficient to trigger drug release within an acidic microenvironment. Cytotoxicity assays performed in vitro suggested that cRGD-conjugated nanoparticles exhibited a greater growth inhibitory potential in cancer cell lines than the free drug or control nanoparticles likely due to cRGD-mediated targeting of tumor cells. In vivo imaging and biodistribution studies further showed that the nanoparticles preferentially accumulated in the tumor tissue under magnetic guidance. Finally, in vivo data for tumor regression along with electrocardiogram recordings and histopathology observations indicated that the cRGD-conjugated polymer-coated magnetic nanoparticles could have a high therapeutic potential as a dual-drug delivery system for the treatment of both cancer and doxorubicin-mediated cardiotoxicity.",

The 5-fluorouracil-free nanoparticles showed improved hemocompatibility, and the 5-fluorouracil-loaded nanoparticles conjugated with folic acid had a high cytotoxicity to MCF7 breast cancer cells, presumably due to intracellular internalization because of folic acid conjugation, which is expected to enhance the cellular uptake of the nanoparticles.",

For this reason, Bu et al. (2013) prepared chitosan nanoparticles conjugated with either biotin or both biotin and avidin as tumor-targeted carrier system for the delivery of trans-resveratrol. Pharmacokinetic experiments revealed that avidin-biotin-loaded nanoparticles rapidly accumulated in the liver after injection, while the delivery nanoparticles conjugated only with biotin was attenuated. Cytotoxicity assays using HepG2 cells further uncovered that compared to trans-resveratrol solution and unconjugated chitosan nanoparticles, both biotin and avidin-biotin loaded nanoparticles significantly improved anticancer activity, but the latter combination exhibited a higher cytotoxicity. Thus, it was proposed that the synthesized nanoparticles conjugated with avidin and biotin may be a potent drug delivery system particularly to targeting hepatic carcinoma.",

Carroll et al. (2016) described another mechanism by which chitosan stimulates the activation of dendritic cells inducing cellular immunity. They found that chitosan promotes the intracellular release of DNA, which involves the cGAS-STING pathway. As a result, type I interferon is secreted activating the expression of interferon-controlled genes. Due to the release of the cytokines that stimulate dendritic cells, the cellular immune system is elicited.",

            "text": "Due to its mucoadhesiveness, chitosan and its derivatives are considered effective for mucosal administration, which includes oral, nasal, as well as ocular antigen-delivery routes. However, other routes are also anticipated to be effective in provoking immune response including subcutaneous (Borges et al. 2008; Scherliess et al. 2013), intraperitoneal (Chang et al. 2010), intravenous (Shi et al. 2011), and intratumoral injections (Zaharoff et al. 2010). Evidently, innate immune responses are stimulated by chitin, chitosan, or derivatives (Peluso et al. 1994; Tokura et al. 1999; Lee et al. 2008; Lee 2009). This includes the activation of alveolar macrophages with the release of cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-12, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, or IL-18, leading to INF-\u03b3 production predominantly released by natural killer cells (Shibata et al. 1997a, b). However, also humoral and cellular adaptive immune responses are triggered by some antigens when co-administered or encapsulated in chitosan-containing micro- and nanoparticles (Tokura et al. 1999; van der Lubben et al. 2001; Arca et al. 2009; Mori et al. 2012). In particular, Wen et al. (2011) found that the stimulatory effect on the humoral and cellular immune system by chitosan results in a balanced Th1/Th2 response. However, care has to be taken in assessing the properties of chitosan-based adjuvants, as many studies do not provide sufficient data on the chemical and physical characteristics, preparation and formulation procedures, as well as potential impurities (Vasiliev 2015). This is particularly critical, as immune responses appear to depend on these parameters as uncovered by Scherliess et al. (2013), who reported that the degree of immune response varied when chitosans of different qualities were used. The immune-stimulatory effect of chitosan is affected by the combination of molecular weight, solubility, particle size, and viscosity as well as deacetylation degree.",

Combinations of chitosan and heat-inactivated human herpes viruses (HSV) were further tested as an immunomodulating adjuvant in T cells and antigen-presenting cells in HSV-infected mice (Choi et al. 2016). Using chitosan nanoparticles targeted to dendritic cells via antibodies to the DEC-205 surface receptor, Raghuwanshi et al. (2012) successfully delivered plasmid DNA carrying the cDNA for the N protein to trigger immunization against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Simultaneous comparison of targeted formulations using intramuscular and intranasal routes revealed that intramuscular administration induced a more potent systemic IgG response compared to intranasal administration. Solid evidence substantiating the advantages of chitosan as an efficient adjuvant for nasal vaccination originates from clinical examinations on a norovirus vaccine, which demonstrated the ability of a chitosan/monophosphoryl lipid-based antigen delivery system (ChiSys\u00ae) to induce immunity against the gastroenteric norovirus infections after immunization (Smith et al. 2014).",

(2011), the effects of chitosan nanoparticles on the immune response triggered by an ovalbumin antigen in mice were analyzed. As the administration of the chitosan nanoparticles did not only increase cytokine levels of Th1 (IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3) and Th2 (Il-10) cells, but also stimulated natural killer cells, the authors suggested that chitosan is a promising adjuvant for cancer immunotherapy by promoting both humoral and cellular immune responses. This hypothesis was confirmed by Highton et al. (2016), who demonstrated that immunization with an ovalbumin/chitosan hydrogel had antitumor effects in an intracaecal mice cancer model. After subcutaneous injection of the ovalbumin/chitosan vaccine, the authors detected CD8+ T memory cells specific for ovalbumin and observed decreased tumor growth in contrast to unvaccinated control mice or mice that were vaccinated with dendritic cells and ovalbumin.",

(2013b) prepared mannosylated chitosan nanoparticles and loaded it with a plasmid to produce a vaccine against gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP), whose receptor is overexpressed in various cancer cells. The nanoparticles were intranasally administered in a subcutaneous mice prostate carcinoma model to evaluate the efficacy on inhibition of the growth of tumor cells. Cell binding and cellular uptake assays revealed that the mannosylated chitosan nanoparticles facilitate targeting to antigen-presenting cells, promoting receptor-mediated endocytosis via the mannose receptor. Due to antigen representation, enhanced tumor regression was observed as a result of the production of high titers of anti-GRP antibodies. A similar strategy was finally used by Lai et al. (2014) to test an immune therapy against hepatocellular carcinoma in a H22 tumor-bearing mice model. They synthesized folate-conjugated chitosan nanoparticles and loaded them with a plasmid-encoding mouse interferon-\u03b3-inducible protein-10 (IP-10). They found that IP-10 plasmid exhibited efficient antitumor activity, prolonging the survival time in H22 tumor-bearing mice. The antitumor effects were likely due to different effects. Next to the secretion of IFN-\u03b3 and IP-10, inhibition of regulatory T cells, suppression of angiogenesis, inhibition of cancer cell proliferation, and activation of apoptosis contributed to tumor growth inhibition.",

            "text": " Bone defects can either be congenital or result from trauma, infection, cancer, or failed orthopedic surgical procedures (Venkatesan and Kim 2010). The grafts used to bridge bone defects can be autografts (bone material from other body regions of the same patient) or allografts (bone material from decedents). However, both materials have disadvantages: autografts require bone harvesting from healthy tissues and may cause complications of wound healing and pain, and allografts may result in immunogenic rejection and have the risk of transmitting viral diseases from the donor to the recipient. Due to these concerns, scientists around the world are searching for alternative materials as bone graft substitutes. As described before, chitosan-based materials have valuable properties for orthopedic applications. Chitosan itself has the capacity to increase bone regeneration rates (Muzzarelli et al. 1993b); however, it cannot fully substitute natural bone material. Therefore, different composite scaffolds have been developed to assure porosity for vascularization and nutrition, facilitate the formation of new bone material (osteoconductivity), guarantee structural integrity during ingrowth at the site of implantation, and orchestrate biodegradation with bone regeneration (Venkatesan and Kim 2010). In addition, chitosan-based composites can be loaded with cells and growth factors that promote osteoconductivity and hence facilitate bone regeneration. One of the most important chitosan grafting that has been used in bone tissue engineering is hydroxyapatite, which by itself stimulates bone regeneration, provided that the scaffold has a microporous structure (Woodard et al. 2007). Hydroxyapatite grafting of chitosan can be easily achieved by coprecipitation from homogeneous mixtures of precursor (Deepthi et al. 2016, and references therein). One of the first researchers who tested combinations of chitosan and hydroxyapatite was Michio Ito, who examined the use of chitosan-bonded hydroxyapatite paste for treatment of periodontal defects (Ito 1991). In 2004, Ge et al. (2004) published a remarkable study, in which they tested different combinations of air- and freeze-dried chitosan/hydroxyapatite materials that were colonized by osteoblasts and implanted into rats. The material was found to be nontoxic and biodegradable and to stimulate mineralization. The explanted material that was colonized by osteoblasts before implantation showed newly formed bone material containing proliferating osteoblasts that recruited surrounding tissue to grow in. In another study published by Oliveira et al. (2006), three-dimensional macroporous hydroxyapatite/chitosan bilayered scaffolds of inorganic and organic deposits were produced in a stepwise procedure and examined with regard to their mechanical properties and cytotoxicity to mouse fibroblast-like cells. Moreover, in vitro cell culture studies using goat marrow stromal cells revealed that the macroporous hydroxyapatite/chitosan composite is a suitable material that promotes attachment, proliferation, and differentiation into osteoblasts and chondrocytes. Additionally, three-layered porous materials of collagen, hydroxyapatite, and chitosan were produced and characterized as an artificial bone matrix (Wang et al. 2008b). When testing murine pre-osteoblast cell line (MC3T3-E1) grown on this matrix, the cells proliferated significantly more rapidly than cells grown on a pure chitosan matrix (Teng et al. 2008). In addition, higher levels of alkaline phosphatase (secreted by osteoblasts) were determined, which is indicative for bone regeneration. Similar results were obtained when osteoblasts were cultured on hydroxyapatite/chitosan nanocomposites and osteocalcin as a marker for late osteoblastic differentiation, and mineralized bone matrix formation was determined (Chesnutt et al. 2009). Further studies characterized hydroxyapatite/chitosan hybrids with additional blend materials such as montmorillonite (Katti et al. 2008), polylactic acid (Cai et al. 2009), cellulose and carboxymethyl cellulose (Liuyun et al. 2009; Jiang et al. 2013b), gelatin (Sellgren and Ma 2012; Maji et al. 2015; Lee et al. 2017), nylon 66 (Huang et al. 2011), polygalacturonic acid (Khanna et al. 2011), marine sponge collagen (Pallela et al. 2012), collagen (Wang et al. 2009), alginate (Jin et al. 2012; Kim et al. 2015; Liao et al. 2018), chondroitin sulfate (Venkatesan et al. 2012a; Hu et al. 2017), hyaluronic acid (Hu et al. 2017), fibroin (Lima et al. 2013; Ran et al. 2016; Ye et al. 2017), poly-3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate (Zhang et al. 2015b), fucoidan (Lowe et al. 2016), \u03b2-tricalcium phosphate (Shavandi et al. 2015; Oryan et al. 2017), graphene oxide (Yu et al. 2017), \u03b2-cyclodextrin (Shakir et al. 2016), \u03b2-1,3-glucan (Przekora and Ginalska 2017; Przekora et al. 2017), whitlockite (Zhou et al. 2017a), zoledronic acid (Lu et al. 2018), and zirconium dioxide (Balagangadharan et al. 2018). Also, three-dimensional hydroxyapatite/chitosan-carbon nanotube scaffolds were shown to be promising materials for bone regeneration (Im et al. 2012). Naturally, many of these combinations have been tested also in the absence of hydroxyapatite (Park et al. 2000a; Li et al. 2005; Jiang et al. 2006; Arpornmaeklong et al. 2008; Venkatesan et al. 2012b; Deng et al. 2013; Azevedo et al. 2014; Dinescu et al. 2014; Listoni et al. 2015; Georgopoulou et al. 2018; Ko\u00e7 Demir et al. 2018).",

            "text": "Several studies showed that various growth factors such as transforming growth factors (TGFs), vascular endothelial growth factors (VGEFs), bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs), insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), and platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs) have major impacts on vascularization and osteoblast activities and thus have been employed to stimulate bone regeneration (Yun et al. 2012). However, there are limitations in maintaining therapeutic concentrations due to the short half-life of the growth factors in vivo. This can be effectively prevented by the controlled release of the growth factors from porous chitosan composite matrices, which have been demonstrated to stimulate bone formation. For instance, PDGF-BB is an important osteogenic growth factor in the process of bone regeneration, as it stimulates mesenchymal cell proliferation and differentiation and mediates chemotaxis of osteoblast. Park et al. (2000a, b) produced a porous chitosan or chondroitin-4-sulfate/chitosan sponges releasing PDGF-BB to stimulate bone regeneration. The release rate of PDGF-BB increased proportionally with increasing concentrations loaded onto the sponge, and PDGF-BB retained its chemotactic activity regardless of being loaded onto the sponge or added freely to test solution (Park et al. 2000a). Finally, osteoblast proliferation was found to be stimulated in PDGF-BB-loaded chondroitin-4-sulfate/chitosan sponge compared with that of the unloaded sponge. PGFs have also been used in combination with other growth factors. As VEGF is known to prolong cell survival, osteoblast proliferation, differentiation, and migration next to its effects on angiogenesis, it has been suggested that the combined action of VEGF and PDGF can accelerate the bone healing process even more efficiently. De la Riva et al. (2010) established a system based on brushite-chitosan capable of controlling release kinetics for these two growth factors. After implanting the chitosan scaffolds loaded with the growth factors into rabbits with femur defects, release kinetics and tissue distribution of radiolabeled VEGF and PDGF were determined. Analyzing bone repair histologically revealed that the combined use of VEGF and PDGF promoted bone regeneration most effectively.",

When the chitosan particles were loaded only with one of the two growth factors, the effect was found to be more pronounced for IGF-1 than for BMP-2 infiltrated matrices. In a very recent study, chitosan/biphasic calcium phosphate scaffolds functionalized with BMP-2-encapsulated nanoparticles and the RGD tripeptide were produced using a desolvation technique (Gan et al. 2018). In vitro cell culture and in vivo implantation tests demonstrated that RGD and BMP-2 synergistically increased cell adhesion and spreading via integrin binding triggering differentiation of osteoblasts. Increased bone healing was also observed, when porous chitosan scaffolds were loaded with resolvin D1, a potent lipid immune modulator derived from both eicosapentaenoic acid, and implanted into rats with a femur defect (Vasconcelos et al. 2018). Obviously, resolving D1 administration in the acute phase of the innate immune response to the bio-implant had beneficial effects during bone tissue repair.",

            "text": "Impairment of the articular cartilage is frequently due to sport-related injury, disease, trauma, and tumor. If not treated successfully, it may result in osteoarthritis, which increasingly affects also younger individuals (Muzzarelli et al. 2012). In contrast to bone regeneration, cartilage healing is limited by the lack of vascularization and poor proliferation rates of chondrocytes. Injection of hyaluronan into the joints of arthritic patients is known to improve their function, as it restores viscoelasticity and flow of the synovial fluid, helps to normalize hyaluronan production, and finally reduces pain and inflammation. Chitosan easily forms polyelectrolyte complexes with hyaluronan and chondroitin sulfate, which are important building blocks particularly of the hyaline cartilage found on the surface of joints. Therefore, combinations of chitosan and hyaluronan and/or chondroitin sulfate may be useful in cartilage healing. In a first attempt to realize this idea, Kuo et al. (2015) synthesized a highly elastic, macroporous, and chitosan-containing gelatin/chondoitin-6-sulfate/hyaluronan (GCH) cryogel scaffold, which mimics the extracellular matrix composition of the cartilage. Furthermore, in vitro cell culture studies suggest that chondrocytes proliferate and redifferentiate within the porous matrix of the cryogels. Although chitosan reduces cell proliferation, it stimulates the secretion of sulfated glycosaminoglycans and type II collagen. In addition, they performed in vivo studies culturing chondrocytes on the GCH chitosan cryogel and implanting the material into rabbits with an articular cartilage defect (Kuo et al. 2015). After 3 months, the defect in the chondrocytes/cryogel group was completely covered with semitransparent tissue, which had similar characteristics as the native cartilage. A large variety of other chitosan-based materials lacking glycosaminoglycans have been suggested as suitable scaffolds for cartilage tissue engineering and some of them have been tested as mesenchymal stem cell carriers. Such materials include scaffolds containing N,N-dicarboxymethyl chitosan (Mattioli-Belmonte et al. 1999), chitosan/ gelatin and/or alginate complex (Xia et al. 2004; Li and Zhang 2005; Bhat et al. 2011), poly(L-lactide)/chitosan microspheres (Lao et al. 2008; Haaparanta et al. 2014), polyethylene oxide/chitin/chitosan scaffolds (Kuo and Ku 2008), genipin-cross-linked chitosan/silk fibroin sponges (Silva et al. 2008; Vishwanath et al. 2016), chitosan/polyester-based scaffolds (Alves da Silva et al. 2010), chitosan/collagen type I scaffolds (Gong et al. 2010), chitosan/poly(epsilon-caprolactone) blend scaffolds (Neves et al. 2011; Filova et al. 2016), chitosan/poly(l- glutamic acid) scaffolds (Zhang et al. 2013a, 2015a), polyvinyl alcohol/chitosan composite hydrogels (Dashtdar et al. 2015), poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)/chitosan hydrogels (Mellati et al. 2016), viscoelastic silk/chitosan microcomposite scaffolds (Chameettachal et al. 2017), and chitosan/graphene oxide polymer nanofibers (Cao et al. 2017).",

In an interesting pilot study, Qi et al. (2013) produced an injectable chitosan/polyvinyl alcohol gel and examined its structure and physicochemical properties. The resulting material exhibited low cytotoxicity and good biocompatibility. Next, the gel was mixed with rabbit bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) that were transfected with an adenovirus to produce TGF-b1, and rabbits with cartilage defects were injected with this mixture. After 16 weeks, the defects appeared to be fully repaired. The regenerated tissue was almost indistinguishable from the native cartilage. In another study, a demineralized bone matrix was conjugated with mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) E7 affinity peptide (EPLQLKM) and combined with a chitosan hydrogel for cartilage engineering. Cell culture and implantation experiments demonstrated that the developed material has a high chondrogenic capacity facilitating tissue repair of cartilage defects (Meng et al. 2015). In a more recently published study, the proliferation and differentiation of multipotent dental pulp stem cells into chondrocytes were investigated to generate cartilage-like material. In this case, a porous chitosan-xanthan gum matrix was employed as a scaffold and loaded with kartogenin to promote chondrogenic differentiation (Westin et al. 2017). The manufactured scaffold exhibited favorable characteristics for cartilage tissue engineering, such as high porosity, low cytotoxicity, and mechanical properties compatible with those characteristic of cartilage.",

Chitosan-based hydrogels and nanocomposites have been used as anti-erosive and enamel-repairing additives in dentifrices and chewing gums (Shibasaki et al. 1994; Arnaud et al. 2010; Ganss et al. 2011; Ruan et al. 2014), for reduction of dental bacterial biofilm formation (Jahanizadeh et al. 2017), for guided tissue regeneration to treat periodontal diseases such as periodontitis (Ma et al. 2014; Lotfi et al. 2016), as dentin-bonding agent (Fawzy et al. 2013), as modification of dental restorative materials and implants (Petri et al. 2007; Ali et al. 2017; Ibrahim et al. 2017a), and as scaffold for stem cell-based tissue regeneration (Yang et al. 2012b; Asghari Sana et al. 2017; Soares et al. 2017a). Periodontitis is a chronic inflammation of the gum, which ultimately may lead to the loss of periodontal tissues and teeth (Pihlstrom et al. 2005). Current therapeutic strategies mainly rely on good oral hygiene (brushing and flossing), plaque removal, and in more severe cases local application of antibiotics and surgical intervention including open flap debridement, osseous surgery, as well as guided tissue and bone regeneration. Chitosan-based materials turned out to be very useful for periodontal tissue regeneration. Such materials comprise methylpyrrolidinone chitosan (Muzzarelli et al. 1993a), chitosan scaffolds coated with a bioactive hydroxyapatite (Ang et al. 2002; Coimbra et al. 2011; Fraga et al. 2011; Miranda et al. 2016), injectable thermosensitive chitosan/\u03b2-glycerophosphate/hydroxyapatite hydrogels (Chen et al. 2016), chitosan-based risedronate/zinc-hydroxyapatite intrapocket dental films (Khajuria et al. 2018), asymmetric chitosan/tripolyphosphate cross-linked membranes (Ma et al. 2014), porous chitosan/ collagen scaffolds (Yang et al. 2012b), mucoadhesive electrospun chitosan and thiolated chitosan nanofibers (Samprasit et al. 2015), chitosan-coated titanium surfaces (Campos et al. 2015), chitosan modified glass ionomer restoratives (Petri et al. 2007), chitosan-intercalated montmorillonite/poly(vinyl alcohol) nanofibers (Ghasemi Hamidabadi et al. 2017), and polyhydroxybutyrate/chitosan/nano-bioglass nanofiber scaffolds (Hashemi-Beni et al. 2018).",

The stem cells grown in this scaffold were successfully transfected by the plasmid vector, which led to the formation of BMP-7 triggering odontoblastic differentiation as indicated by the activation of specific marker genes encoding steocalcin, bone sialoprotein, dentin sialophosphoprotein, and dentin matrix protein 1. The chitosan/ collagen scaffolds with stem cells were subcutaneously implanted into the back of BALB/c mice. After 4 weeks, the material was explanted and evaluated by immunohistochemistry. In the gene-activated scaffold group, there were still transfected cells detectable showing the upregulated gene expression when compared to pure scaffold groups.",

            "text": "Cutaneous wound healing is a complex process in which the skin repairs itself. The process is divided into different stages, which include blood clotting ( hemostasis), inflammation, cell migration and proliferation, and tissue remodeling (maturation). The wound healing process may be delayed or completely fail leading to non-healing chronic wounds, which are frequently found in patients with diabetes, venous or arterial diseases, infections, and age-related metabolic deficiencies. Bedsore and burns behave differently, as the healing process is complicated by coagulation, necrosis, and infections. Small, non-severe wounds may be treated with chitosan-containing ointments (Kweon et al. 2003), topical gels (Alsarra 2009), and/or wound dressings (Jayakumar et al. 2011). For instance, Kang et al. (2016) reported the synthesis of silver chloride nanoparticles stabilized with chitosan oligomer for an ointment that was tested on burn wound healing in a rat model. Burn wound healing of rats treated with this ointment was superior to rats treated with pure Vaseline or chitosan ointments. More severe wounds may require removal of necrotic tissue and surgical wound closure using suturing techniques. If the defects are too large to be covered in this way, autologous avascular mesh grafts, microvascular flap grafts, mikroskin grafts, and/or cultured epithelial grafts are transplanted to the wound site (Chua et al. 2016). However, surgical intervention is only possible up to a critical size. To cover large-sized skin defects, artificial grafts produced by tissue engineering techniques are required. This type of wound dressings must protect from infections, absorb excess exudates, and facilitate oxygen and nutrient exchange. In addition, the material must be nontoxic, non-allergenic, non-adherent, and biocompatible.",

Moreover, chitosan-based scaffolds can be loaded with growth factors to facilitate skin repair by promoting cell adhesion and proliferation (Lu et al. 2016). Several in vitro, preclinical and clinical studies actually demonstrated that chitosan-based hydrogels films, powders, and dressings, as well as artificial skins, accelerate wound healing and reepithelialization (Patrulea et al. 2015). However, the precise mechanism of action in promoting wound healing is still under debate. Next to chitosan-mediated immunomodulation, the type of functionalization contributes to wound healing.",

            "text": "Topical application of anti-inflammatory and antioxidant curcumin, which is a component of many curry powders, has been shown to promote wound healing, significantly preventing oxidative damage in tissues (Gopinath et al. 2004). Chitosan-alginate sponges have been used to deliver curcumin for dermal wound healing in rat. Loading curcumin onto the chitosan sponge enhanced the therapeutic healing effect when compared to other carriers like cotton gauze. Similarly, injectable nanocomposite hydrogels composed of curcumin, N,O- carboxymethyl chitosan, and oxidized alginate possess many characteristics that promote wound healing including exudate absorption and immobilization and activation of growth factors. Nano-curcumin, which is released slowly from the hydrogel in a sustained manner, evidently stimulates fibroblast proliferation, angiogenesis, and collagen production, supporting the healing process when tested in a mice model (Li et al. 2012b). Wound dressings made of chitosan/poly-\u03b3-glutamic acid/pluronic/curcumin nanoparticles also promoted collagen formation and tissue regeneration (Lin et al. 2017), and collagen-alginate scaffolds impregnated with curcumin-loaded chitosan nanoparticles proved promising in the treatment of various pathological manifestations of diabetic wounds (Karri et al. 2016). Most recently, Zhao et al. (2018) prepared a thermosensitive chitosan/\u03b2-glycerophosphate hydrogel loaded with \u03b2-cyclodextrin-curcumin and demonstrated improved healing of infected cutaneous wounds in rats, which may be due to the combination of antioxidative, antimicrobial, and anti-NF-\u03baB signaling effects.",

            "text": "As silver has been demonstrated to have potent antimicrobial activities with no reports on bacterial resistances, several laboratories prepared chitosan wound dressings impregnated with silver to prevent wound infections and promote wound healing (Graham 2005). Indeed, a wound dressing composed of nano-silver and chitosan improved wound healing in rats better than a silver sulfadiazine dressing, which led to unwanted higher silver levels in the blood than the chitosan-silver dressing (Lu et al. 2008). In another study, Abdelgawad et al. (2014) combined silver nanoparticles that were embedded in chitosan with polyvinyl alcohol to produce antimicrobial nanofibrous material for wound dressing. The material with the highest chitosan-silver nanoparticle content was tested against E. coli and showed significant antibacterial activity. A combined antibacterial/tissue regeneration response triggered by functional chitosan-silver nanocomposites was also reported for thermal burns (Luna-Hernandez et al. 2017). To increase antibacterial activity wound dressings, several groups combined chitosan-silver-based materials with sulfadiazine, a sulfonamide antibiotic. Topical administration of chitosan-based hydrogels containing silver sulfadiazine improved burn and wound healing capacities in different studies (Nascimento et al. 2009; Chakavala et al. 2012; Aguzzi et al. 2014; Lee et al. 2014; El-Feky et al. 2017a). Besides inhibiting Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli, chitosan-based dressings carrying silver sulfadiazine also inhibited the growth of Gram-positive bacteria as well as fungi such as C. albicans on an infected wound (El-Feky et al. 2017b).",

(2009) grew human adipose-derived stem cells onto a chitosan/silk fibroin scaffolds and used it in a cutaneous wound healing model. They found that this regimen significantly enhanced wound healing, increasing micro-vascularization and differentiation into epidermal epithelial cells. In another study, an artificial dermis was fabricated by culturing human adipose-derived stem cells on a poly(L-glutamic acid)/chitosan scaffold (Shen et al. 2013b). Notably, the seeded stem cells maintained their capability to proliferate, produce extracellular matrix, and secrete cytokines including transforming growth factor \u03b21 and vascular endothelial growth factor. The artificial dermis was used to cover wounds that have been generated before in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. The artificial dermis significantly accelerated wound closure and healing in diabetic mice. Tong et al. (2016) used a different stem cell-based strategy to generate a skin substitute promoting wound healing. They manufactured a collagen-chitosan sponge scaffold to culture bone marrow-derived stem cells, which were pre-treated by hypoxia to induce the expression of pro-angiogenic cytokines. When the skin substitute was used to treat wounds generated in diabetic rats with hindlimb ischemia, wound healing was enhanced in comparison to scaffold-only controls or skin substitutes that were generated with normoxic stem cells.",

Stem cell-derived exosomes can improve wound healing and promote skin regeneration by stimulating cell proliferation and migration, angiogenesis, and reepithelization and modulating immune responses (Phinney and Pittenger 2017). Based on these observations, Shi et al. (2017b) isolated exosomes derived from gingival mesenchymal stem cells and encapsulated them in chitosan/silk hydrogel sponge.

            "text": " Corneal damage can be the result of different diseases and injuries and may lead to a reduction or even loss of vision. Currently, the only therapy to cure vision loss after irreversible corneal damage is a surgical procedure where the cornea is replaced by donated corneal tissue. Frequently, the entire cornea is replaced in a surgical intervention called penetrating keratoplasty. As there is a shortage of corneal donors and there is a certain risk associated with the surgery and graft rejection, new types of corneal replacements are examined including materials containing chitosan. Actually, topical application of chitosan or chitosan/N-acetylcysteine to the eye is known to enhance corneal epithelial proliferation and migration during the wound healing in rabbits (Fischak et al. 2017). This process appears to involve the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) pathway (Cui et al. 2017). Another study evaluated the effects on corneal epithelium regeneration by combination of exogenous recombinant human serum-derived factor-1\u03b1 (rhSDF-1\u03b1) with a thermosensitive chitosan/gelatin hydrogel and analyzed the underlying mechanism (Tang et al. 2017). Conducting in vitro experiments, the team showed that rhSDF-1\u03b1 enhanced stem cell proliferation, chemotaxis, and migration, as well as the expression of related genes in limbal epithelial and mesenchymal stem cells (LESCs and MSCs). In vivo experiment using an alkali burn-injury rat model further revealed enhanced corneal epithelium regeneration and increased local expression of growth factors known to be essential for corneal epithelium repair. The underlying mechanism by which rhSDF-1\u03b1 released from the chitosan/gelatin hydrogel stimulates corneal regeneration may involve activation of C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) expressing cells (LESCs and MSCs) and chemotactic attraction of these cells to the sites of lesion via the binding of rhSDF-1\u03b1 to the CXCR4 receptor.",

To study cytocompatibility in vitro, they cultured rabbit limbal corneal epithelial cells, corneal endothelial cells, and keratocytes on the polymer complexes and demonstrated that the corneal cells were able to attach, migrate, and proliferate. To evaluate biocompatibility in vivo, they implanted the polymer complex into the corneal stroma of rabbit eyes and inspected ocular reactions. Overall, the polymer complexes exhibited transparency and good biocompatibility, as they were degraded and absorbed within the corneal tissue while maintaining transparency. In another study, poly(ethylene glycol)-stabilized carbodiimide-cross-linked collagen-chitosan hydrogels were tested for biocompatibility and host-graft integration. For this purpose, Rafat et al. (2008) performed in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrating excellent biocompatibility when analyzing human corneal cells, dorsal root ganglia from chick embryos, or subcutaneous implants. The hydrogel scaffold was also studied as corneal substitute by implanting it into the cornea of pig eyes and monitoring them for 12 months. The substitute was seamlessly integrated into the cornea with regeneration of host corneal epithelium, stroma, and nerves. Liang et al. (2011) prepared a blend membrane composed of hydroxyethyl-chitosan, gelatin, and chondroitin sulfate. The membrane exhibited good transparency, ion and glucose permeability, and cytocompatibility for corneal endothelial cells, which formed a monolayer on the membrane in cell culture. In vivo animal experiments revealed that the membranes were characterized by biodegradability and a good histocompatibility suggesting that the membranes may be employed as carriers for corneal endothelial cell transplantation. Similar results were obtained for chitosan/polycaprolactone, chitosan/poly(ethylene glycol), silk fibroin/chitosan, carboxymethyl chitosan/gelatin/ hyaluronic acid, as well as hydroxyethyl-chitosan blend membranes, which were tested as potential scaffolds and carriers for bovine, ovine, and rabbit corneal endothelial cells, respectively (Wang et al. 2012b; Guan et al. 2013; Ozcelik et al. 2013; Liang et al. 2014; Xu et al. 2018).",

Although therapeutic interventions to peripheral nerve repair have yielded some progress during the past years, a full recovery of nerve function is usually not achieved. Current therapies mostly rely on microsurgical techniques, which either try to directly establish a tension-free connection between the ends of severed nerves (epineural, fascicular, and grouped fascicular repair) or bridge larger nerve defects by autologous grafts (cable grafts, trunk grafts, and vascularized nerve grafts) (Matsuyama et al. 2000; Houschyar et al. 2016). The various neurosurgical techniques used to connect nerve ends are challenging, and the therapeutic results are frequently not satisfactory. Many studies have provided evidence that various types of conduits, such as veins, pseudo-sheaths, and bioabsorbable tubes, are helpful in bridging shorter gaps by promoting nerve regeneration. After bridging nerve gaps with hollow conduits, the lumen between the nerve ends becomes filled with fibrin, and macrophages and other cells are attracted, which create a favorable microenvironment for vascularization and neuronalization.",

An early electrophysiological and histological study on nerve regeneration using rat sciatic nerve defects demonstrated that pure chitosan/collagen conduits were superior in bridging 1 cm nerve defects to that of control groups (Wei et al. 2003). The chitosan/collagen film was found to be degraded about 3 months after the surgery. In a methodologically similar study, Wang et al. (2005) generated an artificial nerve graft composed of a chitosan conduit and tested them to bridge a 3 cm dog sciatic nerve defect. In contrast to the previous study, the conduit was filled with longitudinally arranged filaments of polyglcyolic acid. The team found that the sciatic nerve trunk was successfully reconstructed in dogs treated with the chitosan/polyglycolic acid graft with reinnervation of the target skeletal muscle. In a case report on a 55-year-old man with a 3 cm median nerve defect in the distal forearm, implantation of chitosan/polyglycolic acid graft promoted nerve regeneration and functional reconstruction, so that the patient was able after 36 months to fully use the injured hand during daily activities (Gu et al. 2012).

Zheng and Cui (2010) tested chitosan conduits of such kind combined with rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells to evaluate their potential for the reconstruction of 8-mm-long rat sciatic nerve defects. They demonstrated that the combination of chitosan and mesenchymal stem cells alone was sufficient to improve nerve regeneration and functional recovery. Moreover, some of the mesenchymal stem cells were found to have differentiated into neural stem cells. Similar results were obtained when injured rat sciatic nerves were treated in this way, and the nerve repair was monitored electrophysiologically and histomorphologically (Moattari et al. 2018) or by noninvasive magnetic resonance neurographic imaging (Liao et al. 2012). In addition, chitosan-coated poly-3-hydroxybutyrate conduits combined with human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells were recently shown to be efficient in promoting nerve regeneration in this rat model of sciatic nerve injury (Ozer et al. 2018). Improved nerve regeneration was also reported for chitosan/poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) scaffolds seeded with autologous bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells to treat injuries of dog sciatic nerves and rhesus monkey median nerves (Xue et al. 2012; Hu et al. 2013). In another approach, Zhu et al. (2015) used chitosan conduits filled with bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and evaluated nerve regeneration and neuronal survival when injured lumbosacral nerves were bridged with this material. They found that this treatment enhanced sacral nerve regeneration and motor function 6 and 12 weeks after the surgery. Moreover, the mesenchymal stem cells prevented cell death of motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord, thereby improving the motor function in rats treated with the mesenchymal stem cell-seeded chitosan conduit. Finally, a clinical study performed with 14 patients suggests that defects in chronic spinal cord injury can be successfully bridged with peripheral nerve grafts combined with a chitosan-laminin scaffold and co-transplanted bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, which enhanced recovery (Amr et al. 2014).",

Notably, delivery of FGF by seeded Schwann cells genetically modified to overexpress this factor improved nerve regeneration significantly. Unexpectedly, Schwann cells expressing GDNF did not show positive effects in this experimental setup. Recently, Zhu et al.

            "text": "Numerous studies reported favorable effects of chitosan-based materials for a wide range of applications. Doubtless, the controlled and targeted delivery of drugs to specific tissues has a great potential in biomedicine, and first clinical trials with chitosan-based drug carrier systems revealed promising results for the therapy of a variety of diseases including diabetes and cancer and also mainly because adverse side effects are reduced. The antimicrobial activity of chitosan and its derivatives is particularly important when the polymer is used for textile fabrication, food packaging, wound dressings, and tissue engineering. However, the underlying mechanism of antimicrobial activity is not fully understood. One prominent explanation is the assumed interaction of chitosan\u2019s positively charged amine groups with the negatively charged surface of bacteria and fungi, which might impair the movement of ions across membranes and hence disrupt cellular integrity. Although the proposed mechanisms seem plausible, there is a clear lack of experimental data that would provide evidence at a molecular level reminding us to continue basic research on the mode of actions. The studies conducted so far indicate that the antimicrobial activity of pure chitosan is not sufficient to prevent microbial infections completely in vivo. However, chitosan and its derivatives can be combined with other antimicrobial compounds including essential oils (Krausz et al. 2015), polyphenols (Madureira et al. 2015), tretinoin (Ridolfi et al. 2012), metal ions (Sanpui et al. 2008; Tran et al. 2010), lysozyme (Wu et al. 2017), or antibodies (Jamil et al. 2016), to prevent bacterial of fungal infections. Thus, chitosan appears to be an ideal adjuvant polymer for design and production of new materials exhibiting intrinsic antimicrobial properties for a large variety of potential applications in the chemical, pharmaceutical, food, and textile industry. Similarly, the observed immune-stimulatory effects of chitosan need further investigation, as there may be a certain risk to develop allergic or even anaphylactic reactions after oral ingestion (Kato et al. 2005). However, it has to be noted that overall the beneficial characteristics exceed possible side effects due to some allergic potential. Finally, the antitumor activity of chitosan also needs to be analyzed in more detail. Recently, Li et al. (2018b) provided some evidence indicating that chitosan activates dendritic cells, which subsequently secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines and thereby enhance immune surveillance by natural killer cells. Accordingly, the antitumor effects of chitosan can be enhanced by specifically targeting dendritic cells by attaching mannose to the surface of chitosan nanoparticles (Shi et al. 2017a). Different pattern recognition receptors that are expressed on the surface of dendritic cells are potential receptors for chitosan. This includes Toll-like receptors, C-type lectin receptors, and other molecules, which are known to recognize specific molecular patterns, particularly those associated with pathogens. However, currently it is not known how dendritic cells recognize chitosan. In summary, it has to be noted that chitosan is a highly promising material for a variety of applications in industry and medicine. While chitosan-based materials have been commercially launched as packaging and coating material in food industry, as an ingredient in cosmetics, and as ion exchanger in water treatment and are approved for human dietary use and wound dressing, their commercial applications in medicine as drug delivery systems or scaffold for tissue engineering are pending. Nevertheless, there are clinical phase 2/3 trials, and depending on their outcome, some products may reach first approval by the health authorities in near future.",
