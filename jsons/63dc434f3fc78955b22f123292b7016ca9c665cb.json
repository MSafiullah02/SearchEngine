Attention should be given to staff members who are themselves immunosuppressed and or have family members that are at high risk for complications of COVID-19.These staff members should be the first considered when developing work-from-home practices.In the development of work-from-home strategies, employees should have reliable internet connection and either a home computer or an employer-issued device to log into the institutional electronic medical record (EMR) to continue to provide clinical services. Employees should maintain a workspace that is free of other distractions. Instructions should be created for the staff working remotely on how to check voicemail when not in the office, how to access translator services if needed, and available technologies to be able to use personal cell phones to securely call patients. Most importantly, communication channels back to the clinical team should be created and physicians or advanced practice providers should be aware of how to reach the pharmacists that are completing their work remotely.

Care requires a multidisciplinary approach throughout the entirety of a patient's transplant journey. A key member to the interdisciplinary team in the clinic is the HCT clinical pharmacist. Education, drug therapy management, supportive care, and management of acute and chronic complications of HCT are among the services provided by clinical pharmacists in the clinic. Successful delivery of these services has required integration into clinic workflows. Such integration is valuable to providers and patients alike. In the face of COVID-19, pharmacists are now challenged identifying creative and innovative ways to deliver these services to ambulatory transplant patients while minimizing viral spread in a high risk, immunocompromised population. This has required that pharmacists depend on established relationships with their teams to provide care while protecting the health of both of patients and their colleagues. This can be achieved by models that minimize the physical presence of pharmacist, distribute work among resources, and leverage technology.Strategies for minimizing physical presence in clinic depend on existing infrastructure and pharmacist resources. Pharmacists that exist as the only HCT pharmacist in their clinic can consider rescheduling patients in a way that allows for onsite care on specific days of the week and remote care on other days of the week, relieving them of the need to be physically in clinic every day. Alternatively, some institutions may have a team of clinical-based HCT pharmacists. These pharmacists can implement rotations that allow them to maintain onsite direct patient care services, while simultaneously limiting the personnel in clinic. This may involve pharmacists rotating onsite coverage by certain days of the week or adopting a week-long rotation for improved continuity. Lastly, pharmacists in the ambulatory HCT setting may have administrative days built into their staffing model as well. These days are usually when pharmacists are not engaging in direct patient care visits but are conducting indirect patient care activities including progress note documentation, phone call follow up and medication and care coordination. These indirect patient care days are ideal opportunities for pharmacists to work remotely to limit exposure and contact.When considering onsite and remote models, pharmacist should consider what services are best provided onsite and which can be maintained remotely and distribute those services among resources accordingly. Clinic pharmacists can perform order verification responsibilities, chemotherapy order preparation, or treatment plan implementation remotely. Clinical services such as laboratory follow-up, therapeutic drug monitoring, transplant education, oral chemotherapy counseling and follow-up, and medication reconciliation can also be performed via phone by an offsite resource. Pharmacists that maintain an onsite presence can serve as immediate support to their clinic teams for issues that may arise in the delivery of care that require a timelier response such as rapid responses and codes. If able, providing this at-the-elbow support onsite can help maintain clinic workflow efficiency and throughput.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF3": {"text": ". Many centers may already have a developed and implemented model for telemedicine in place and other institutions are actively working toward this capability.Pandemics such as this create the opportunity for teams to scale and leverage those services to a greater population of patients. Home access through virtual private network (VPN) clients and Citrix\u00ae platforms allow for easy access to the necessary data to complete clinical responsibilities. as well as being readily available to the clinical team. We recommend partnering with the information technology (IT) department within the organization for guidance on available options and implementation of telemedicine capabilities are aware that this can vary from institution to institution. These modes of communication, while extremely convenient, should be first be approved by the institution to ensure that patient confidentiality is maintained, and accounts are secure.For communication with the clinical team, pharmacists can use chat and messaging functions that may be embedded in, or exist outside of, the medical record to communicate directly with colleagues (ex: Epic\u00ae Inbasket, Epic\u00ae chat, Jabber\u00ae chat, Cureatr\u00ae, Voalte\u00ae, Skype for Business\u00ae).With institutions limiting, or in many cases, prohibiting visitors, the education for patients and caregivers has become difficult and alternative measures need to be used such as email, phone, Facetime\u00ae, or Zoom\u00ae technology. Communication to patients can be achieved through electronic messaging or calling.If there are requests for patient resources such as medication calendars and/or customized education sheets, these can often be sent to the patient via electronic portals including email or messaging through the electronic health record (ex: Epic MyChart\u00ae). More involved education discussions and/or updates to care plans can be completed via phone visits by using telephonic audio services (ex: Doximity\u00ae, Jabber phone\u00ae).
