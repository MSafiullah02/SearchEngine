High-risk positions with constant contact with the infected, high-risk infected environments with inadequate protection from contamination, lack of contact with family members, frustration, prejudice, loneliness, and fatigue further cause mental health issues such as stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, insomnia, denial, anger, and fear (7) . Mental health problems not only affect the medical staff's attention, understanding, and decision-making ability, but may also prevent them from combatting the virus (7) . Many of the medical and nursing staff working in Wuhan had mental health disorders (9) . Medical staff not only tolerate the excess workload, but also run a high risk of infection. Furthermore, prolonged stress increases susceptibility to depression or other mental illnesses, leading to the increased risk of infection (10) . Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to protective factors and the process of successful adaptation to adverse conditions (11) . The paucity of research in Iran, which is currently affected by this virus, has led researchers to investigate the effects of the pandemic on depression and anxiety in the general public and healthcare workers. Finally, it is important to establish early purposive mental health interventions throughout Iran.",
