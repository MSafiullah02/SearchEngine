The half maximum inhibitory concentration (IC50) or half maximum effective concentration (EC50) values of these compounds, except for compound 6, were found to be in the submicromolar ranges. Among different P3 residues, that is, compounds 1\u20135, compound 2 displayed the highest inhibitory activities both in the enzyme and cell-based assays. The d-amino acid analog 3 exhibits lower activities than that of 2, and 2-naphthyl 4 and biphenyl 5 showed slightly weaker activity than that of 2. Among different warheads, compounds 2 and 7 possess the strongest activities. Bisulfite adduct 7 is a precursor and pro-drug of 2 through equilibrium in aqueous solution.14 It is possible that the activity of \u03b1-hydroxy phosphonate (warhead) varies in different conditions in enzyme and cell-based assays. Nevertheless, compound 8 showed strong activity in NV replicon cells.",
