The 2014 outbreak of MERS in Saudi Arabia raised the concern that this virus has mutated and become more transmissible or virulent. The outbreak of CoV is also reported from the Republic of Korea where 36 mortalities have been reported from May 2015 to 19th August 2015.[3] Recent outbreak of CoV has affected more than 186 persons worldwide including Middle East countries, Republic of Korea, Jordan, Kuwait and some parts of Europe. Till date probably no case of MERS has been detected from India. Since September 2012, WHO has been notified of 1599 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 574 related deaths.",

The MERS virus circulated in camel populations in Africa and the Arabian countries for many years. In 2012, MERS-CoV spread to human populations, with camels being the most likely source. Various possible routes of spread from camels to humans exist. Among human beings, it is transmitted by droplet, contact and airborne spread. The incubation period for cases associated with limited human-to-human transmission ranges from 2 to 14 days. The virus is most commonly found in the lower respiratory tract of symptomatic patients and shedding may persist for up to 2 weeks. Lower respiratory tract shedding of MERS-CoV RNA can be detected after 1 month of illness in most patients, suggesting that prolonged shedding could be a source for spread in outbreaks.[8]",

It is hoped that by the time vaccine is developed, the virus may be contained.[13] There is no specific treatment for MERS and supportive treatment remains the mainstay of management. In Korea, hundreds of schools and few hospitals were closed during the outbreak. The healthcare authorities traced thousands of suspected contacts and monitored them for 14 days \u2013 the maximum incubation period of the disease. Any person who began to show symptoms was quarantined. Healthcare workers and other patients were protected by treating the infected in negative pressure rooms. The government had also created separate spaces at some emergency rooms to deal specifically with suspected MERS patients. WHO and United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Saudi Ministry of Health have issued various recommendations for prevention of MERS.[14] The infection prevention and control measures are droplet precautions (wearing a surgical mask within 1 m of patients) and contact precautions (wearing gown and gloves on entering patient's rooms and removing them on leaving). Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to all patients with signs of acute respiratory infection.[15] The use of personal protective equipment such as gowns, gloves, goggles or face shield and respiratory protection equivalent as disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirator are recommended. Patients with MERS should be placed in negative pressure rooms or in rooms in which room exhaust is filtered through high-efficiency particulate air filters. Airborne preventive measures with at least six air changes per hour should be used in treatment rooms, especially during high-risk procedures such as bronchoscopy, intubation, nebulisation therapy or tracheal suction.[16] These recommendations are evidence-based and have proven to be effective in hospitals in affected countries. The WHO recommends that individuals who are at high risk of virulent disease such as immunocompromised hosts, diabetics, patients with chronic lung disease or preexisting renal failure should take precautions when visiting areas where camels are present. Regarding travel to these areas, WHO has neither recommended any special screening or quarantine at the entry points nor restricted applications of travel and trade. However, countries outside the affected region should maintain a high level of vigilance, especially countries with large numbers of travellers or guest workers returning from the Middle East.[17]",
