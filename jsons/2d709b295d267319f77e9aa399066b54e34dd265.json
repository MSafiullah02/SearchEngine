The risk of transmission during aerosol-generating procedures such as bag mask ventilation, tracheal intubation/extubation, tracheostomy, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, manual noninvasive ventilation and bronchoscopy is alarming. 1 The widespread concern for a shortage and lack of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) compounds this frightening outcome and can lead to noncompliance of protective guidelines for health care providers up to the point that we are allowing extended use and reuse of N95 respirators.",

Unfortunately, newer evidence suggests that the COVID-19 model of droplet/aerosol spread and transmission might be too simplistic as the virus can remain in aerosols for hours and on surfaces for days [4] [5] [6] [7] .

It is probable that beyond the ongoing surge there will be a second wave of cases and eventually recurring viral outbreaks in the community. At the London Hospitals in London, ON, Canada, we recognize the need for viable solutions to protect healthcare providers, especially during aerosol-generating procedures. A reasonable approach to address this objective is the creation of a physical barrier that helps protect healthcare providers and the surrounding environment. Two methods recently explored and described in the literature and social media are generating much interest: 1) a simple covering of the patient with a plastic drape over the upper body, 9 and 2) a partially enclosed working space 10 . Our proposal adopts concepts learned from both approaches; however, we added significant functional improvements while keeping the idea as simple and reproducible as possible for others to replicate.",

Ultraviolet light traceable aerosol (fluorescein) was created by an ultrasonic nebulizer (Trust Life Brand Quality\u2122, Shoppers Drug Mart \u00ae , Toronto, ON, Canada) to assess gross leakage from the bag and surroundings contamination.Our prototypical PVC rigid frame chamber is shown inFigure 1. Clearance of the fluorescein tracer, contamination of the operator, bag, table, and support structures were qualitatively assessed. A simulated cough to assess protection of the operator's PPE was performed (available for visualization at https://youtu.be/dVP3XinNIhg). We demonstrated containment of both droplets and aerosols, the ability to clear the bag of aerosolized particles with negative air-flow, and the protection of the operator and environment.",
