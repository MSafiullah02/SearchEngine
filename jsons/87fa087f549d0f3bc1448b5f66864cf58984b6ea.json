In this study, we analyzed clinical and transmission features of 25 cases of Covid-19 from a single thoracic department, including 13 patients and 12 health care staff. There were 13 males and 12 females. The median age of the patients was 61 (range: 51 to 69) years. The median age of the health care staff was 35 (range: 22 to 51) years. By the end of follow-up date (Mar. 3, 2020), there were 16 non-severe cases (64%) and 9 severe cases (36%), 5 cases were dead (20%). Nineteen (76%) of the infected cases were confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test, the rest were clinically diagnosed as suspected Covid-19 cases, and 19 (76%) of the infected cases had positive exposure history. We found that COPD was significantly associated with severity and death (P=0.040, and P=0.038, respectively), and chest operation was significantly associated with death for Covid-19 patients (P=0.039). A potential \"super spreader\" may be the source of the transmission before the implementation of quarantine and comprehensive protection.

Hospital outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred in the early phase of epidemic when the disease was not recognized and before quarantine measures were implemented. Patients admitted in thoracic surgery department undergoing operation, are commonly presented with pulmonary infections before or after thoracic operations. In the early phase of epidemic, the differential diagnosis between Covid-19 and infections caused by other pathogens is not well recognized. Thus, it is even more difficult to identify SARS-CoV2 infected patients and to take appropriate protective measures to prevent nosocomial infection.

Liu et al found that CRP, LDH, and lymphocyte count may be predictors of the severity of lung injury [3] . However, there is no significant correlation between the laboratory results and the severity of Covid-19. Jiang et al reported that PCT was increased in Covid-19 patients undergoing thoracic surgery [4] . In our study, an increase of PCT was not observed in Covid-19 patients. The discrepancy may be explained by small sample size. Covid-19 is mainly manifested as fever, accompanied by cough, fatigue, muscular soreness, chest depression, shortness of breath, diarrhea and other symptoms [1] . Postoperative patients may also have fever, cough and chest condition, which should be differentiate from Covid-19. Postoperative infection is mainly due to insufficient drainage and mostly caused by bacteria, commonly occurring 3 to 7 days after operation, accompanied with cough with sputum, elevated WBC count. While most Covid-19 patients had normal or reduced WBC count, and lower lymphocyte count. Early chest CT of Covid-19 shows localized ground glass shadows and interstitial changes, which are mainly in the dorsal or periphery part of the lung [5] . Furthermore, multiple infiltrating shadows and lung consolidation can be seen in both lungs. Pleural effusion is rare in severe cases [6, 7] . Some early Covid-19 may present as single or multiple GGO-like changes, which needs to be identified from lung cancer [8] . Some mild Covid-19 may progress to severe stage within a few days, and repeated chest CT is necessary. SARS-CoV-2 is highly infectious and is susceptible to all populations. Respiratory droplets and contact transmission are the main transmission routes, and aerosol transmission is also possible [1] . Infected patient is the main source of transmission, even in asymptomatic stage. Thoracic surgery requires patients to do respiratory function exercise after operation, including productive cough.

Meanwhile, the patient had normal body temperature without dyspnea (February 2, 2020). After supportive treatments, most of lesions were markedly absorbed, but the RT-PCR test of SARS-CoV-2 was still positive (February 14, 2020); C: 63-year-old man, a patch of pure GGO and subpleural interstitial changes were observed before the operation (January 3, 2020). Multiple patches were found 2 days after the operation (January 19, 2020) and the disease was rapidly progressed, appearing as multiple GGOs with crazy-paving sign and consolidations (January 21, 2020); D: 56-year-old woman, chest CT was normal before the surgery (January 15, 2020).

To et al [9] found that sputum was an important source of transmission. Therefore, Covid-19 patients are highly contagious in department of thoracic surgery. Tuite et al [10] found that the average basic infection number R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was 2.3 on January 24, 2020, and the effective infection number Re was reduced to 1.5 after effective protective measures were taken on February 3, 2020. Therefore, effective protective measures can reduce R0. However, with daily standard protection equipment, health care staff are highly susceptible to Covid-19 [11] . We suggest thoracic surgeons should delay the selective operation and confine operation, and strictly grasp the indications of emergency operation during the outbreak. Asymptomatic patients should be concerned, and routine blood test, chest CT and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid examination should be performed before emergency surgery. \"Super spreader\" indicates patient potentially transmits infection to more than 10 people. To our knowledge, no \"super spreader\" has been reported in China yet. Retrospective analysis of 25 cases of Covid-19 in our department revealed 11 SARS-CoV-2 infected cases with traceable exposure history with \"Patient 01\". \"Patient 01\" was a 63-year-old smoking male with lung cancer who had COPD. The preoperative evaluation of lung function is sufficient for lobectomy. Before the operation was performed, his CT image showed a patch opacity in the right lung and interstitial abnormalities in both lungs, the early signs of Covid-19. He was misdiagnosed before operation. Eleven confirmed Covid-19 cases occurred after the operation date of \"Patient 01\", most likely due to aerosol and droplets generated from his cough. Due to insufficient preparation, inappropriate protective measures were implemented at the beginning of outbreak and caused a large number of infection among hospitalized patients and health care staff. Unfortunately, \"Patient 01\" had rapid progression and died from respiratory failure 5 days after operation. He was considered as a \"super spreader\" in the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection in our department. In summary, SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious. Hospitalized patients and health care staff in the epidemic are at high risk of infection. Patients infected with Covid-19 in perioperative period have high risk of death.
