            "text": "In China, there is no strict referral mechanism for Chinese residents seeking medical treatment [1]. The public tends to go directly to secondary and tertiary public hospitals instead of primary care institutions because of the high quality care in hospitals. To promote the medical capabilities of community healthcare institutions, China is actively learning from Western countries, enacting healthcare reform and vigorously developing general practices in communities. In the community healthcare institutions in China, usually the general practitioners provided health service for the patients, and the patients should pay for the service each time when they seek the treatment. For patients with various health insurance, namely urban social insurance for workers, urban social insurance for citizens, new rural cooperative medical insurance, self-paying or other, the reimbursement ratio showed a decreasing tendency in that order. However, the current health insurance hasn\u2019t played important role in restricting patients\u2019 behaviour [1, 2]. The ageing of society and the accompanying high incidence rates of chronic diseases [3] have led primary healthcare institutions to prioritize the prevention and treatment of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). This finding is consistent with the results of the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 [4], which showed that the disease burden was dominated by NCDs, affecting years lived with disabilities (YLDs) in all regions except sub-Saharan Africa. In the past 20 years, NCDs have been the focus of researchers and policy makers worldwide.",

            "text": "However, at present, as it develops a national primary healthcare system, the Chinese government usually provides financial support for the prevention and treatment of certain diseases with high incidence rates in Western countries, such as hypertension and diabetes [1, 2]. However, there is no accurate evidence supporting this prioritization of conditions and the consequent allocation of medical resources in community healthcare institutions. The limitations of the existing studies are as follows: first, there is a lack of high-quality institution-level disease spectrum evidence [3, 5]. Usually, the conclusions drawn were primarily based on data from the CDC surveillance system in China [1\u20133]. However, these data are sampled and are usually targeted at the cause of death and the morbidity rates of specific diseases, including some infectious diseases and a small proportion of chronic diseases, such as cancer. Second, although existing research has studied disease patterns, few have explored the characteristics of those patients who primarily seek service in community institutions [5\u20138]. To increase the accuracy of the morbidity rates of broader categories of infectious diseases and NCDs, increasing numbers of studies are beginning to focus on the high-level data, such as inpatient and outpatient electronic health records (EHRs), which are collected from healthcare institutions. Yu et al. elucidated the spectrum and characteristics of severe NCDs in eastern coastal China by analysing the longitudinal EHRs from inpatients in 12 general tertiary hospitals [5]. In 2017, the Health Bureau of Chongqing city in China analysed the characteristics of inpatients with cancer based on EHRs from all secondary and tertiary hospitals [9]. However, there is a lack of service demand and healthcare delivery in primary care institutions.",

The characteristics of this city are as follows: first, comparatively, the overall health of its residents are similar to that of individuals in developed countries; second, the diversity within groups, such as urban vs. rural inhabitants and individuals of different sexes and ages, may contribute to differences in the utilization of primary care institutions [10].

            "text": "Overall, visits for NCDs accounted for the majority of visits in our study. The fact that the proportions of visits for cardiovascular and circulatory diseases and chronic respiratory diseases were the highest may be associated with air pollution in Shanghai, as it has been proposed by many researchers that exposure to high levels of ambient particulate matter (PM) is related to the incidence of these diseases in China [11, 12]. Among cardiovascular diseases, hypertension and chronic ischaemic heart disease were the most common reasons outpatients sought care in community healthcare centres, especially among outpatients older than 18 years. This is consistent with the morbidity rates of chronic diseases in the \u201cMonitoring report of chronic diseases and their risk factors in Shanghai\u201d released by the Shanghai CDC, which reported that 28.4% of residents over 18 years old in Shanghai had hypertension in 2012 [13, 14]. These diseases should be paid particular attention when improving the medical capacity of community healthcare centres. Chronic respiratory diseases were common in both males and females and in various age groups (ranked 2). In the group aged < 39 years, the situation was more serious. In other cities in China, chronic respiratory diseases are severe and common due to air pollution [15\u201317], and they have constituted a serious problem for many years [18, 19]. Data from a systematic review study with source from 17 provinces showed that for the outpatients between 0 and 18 years in community healthcare institutions, the number of respiratory diseases outpatients were the top one [20]. However, it ranked 2 for this age group in our study. This difference can be explained that many of the community health centres in Shanghai didn\u2019t have pediatric departments, and patients would love to choose the higher level hospitals due to its good access to these medical service. By comparing with other counties, we found that in the GBD study in 327 regions, the global incidence and prevalence rates of respiratory diseases, including chronic respiratory diseases and acute upper respiratory infections, were not the highest among all studied conditions. Additionally, in high-income developed countries, the estimated loss of YLDs due to respiratory diseases was much lower than that in low-income developed countries, regardless of sex or age [21]. This may be due to air pollution, which is positively associated with the admission of respiratory patients in developing countries among different age groups; this association is especially strong in vulnerable groups (children and elderly individuals) [22\u201324]. However, the fact that community health centre visits were frequently for acute upper respiratory tract infections was ignored in terms of public healthcare resource allocation [25]. In contrast, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and community-acquired pneumonia, which were rarely the reasons for visits to community healthcare centres, were afforded substantial attention from the government. This indicates that more resources should be allocated to the treatment of acute respiratory infections, especially in the relatively younger population. In this study, diabetes was more common in the group aged over 40 years than in the younger age groups. This was in accordance with the healthcare resource allocation policy. The group aged 0\u201330 years was more likely to suffer from digestive diseases than other age groups. The high proportion of outpatient visits for digestive diseases may be due in large part to the irregular eating habits that form part of the fast-paced lifestyle in Shanghai [26, 27]. However, digestive diseases have not received much attention in public health policies.",

Much work still needs to be done regarding the improvement of the medical functionality of community health care centres and the prevention and treatment of endemic diseases, which represents a gap between China and high-income countries [34, 35]. Based on the disease spectrum among outpatients in all community healthcare centres in Shanghai, we suggest that the delivery of primary care should be evidence-based and targeted at the services most commonly utilized by vulnerable groups.",

However, there are several limitations to this study. First, due to the nature of the outpatient records system, we could not access the comorbidities of the outpatients, which may lower the precision of the outpatient disease spectrum. Second, due to the statistical power, there may be disease spectrum disparities between this study and other domestic and international studies. Further published results from the outpatient data are expected. Third, because the population was stable over the study period, and we analysed the proportion instead of incidence or prevalence, both discounting and age-weighting were omitted from this study.",
