            "text": "Patients with acute leukemia are at increased risk of developing infections both as a result of the leukemia and its treatment [1]. Neutropenia is the primary risk factor associated with the development of infection, with the severity and frequency of infection increasing as the absolute neutrophil count drops below 500 cells/mm3, as initially described by Bodey and colleagues [2]. Other risk factors may be present including impaired cellular or humoral immunity, breakdown of normal barriers such as the skin and mucosal surfaces, and vascular access catheters and other foreign medical devices. Multiple risk factors are often present in the same patient. Additionally, the frequent use of antimicrobial agents for various indications (prophylaxis, empiric therapy, pre-emptive administration, specific or targeted therapy, and occasionally maintenance or suppressive therapy) has an impact on the nature and spectrum of infections, with the emergence/selection of multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms being of particular concern [3\u20137]. Bacterial infections tend to occur early on in a neutropenic episode, with fungal infections being uncommon at this stage. If neutropenia persists, the risk for fungal infections increases. There are periodic changes in the epidemiology/spectrum of infection in patients with leukemia. It is important to conduct periodic epidemiologic and susceptibility/resistance surveys, especially at institutions dealing with large numbers of such patients, in order to detect these shifts and changes in susceptibility/resistance patterns, since empiric therapy is largely based on this information [8, 9]. Such surveys are conducted every 3\u20135 years at our institution.",

Recent data show that ~15\u201325 % of bacteremias in neutropenic patients, including catheter-related infections, are polymicrobial [11\u201313]. Infections involving deep tissue sites are predominantly polymicrobial [14]. These include neutropenic enterocolitis, perirectal infections, complicated skin/skin structure infections, and pneumonia.

            "text": "The most common and important sites of infection in patients with acute leukemia are listed in Table 1.1. Overall, the respiratory tract is the most common site of infection. Approximately 25 % of patients with acute leukemia will develop a pulmonary infiltrate during an episode of neutropenia lasting 10 days or longer. Other parts of the respiratory tract including the oropharynx, upper airways, and the paranasal sinuses are also frequent sites of infection. Most pulmonary infiltrates are secondary to an infectious process (bacterial and fungal organisms predominate) although it is often quite difficult to establish a specific microbiologic diagnosis. Noninfectious causes of pulmonary infiltrates such as alveolar hemorrhage and drug toxicity are much less common. Consequently, empiric therapy directed against anticipated pathogens is generally administered in such patients and can be modified if confirmatory microbiologic data become available. The management of patients with pulmonary infections/complications is discussed in detail else where. Approximately 15\u201320 % of patients with acute leukemia and neutropenia will develop a bloodstream infection. These include primary bacteremias and central line-associated infections. Gram-positive bacteria are isolated most often (~75\u201380 % of the time) with organisms colonizing the skin (e.g., Staphylococcus species, Bacillus species, Corynebacterium species) being predominant [13\u201316]. In patients with oral or intestinal mucositis, viridans group streptococci (VGS), enterococci (including VRE), and enteric gram-negative organisms are common pathogens [17, 18]. The frequency of gram-negative bacteremia is lower in patients receiving antibacterial prophylaxis with agents such as the fluoroquinolones, than in patients not receiving prophylaxis [19, 20]. Fungemias occur ~4\u20136 % of the time, are caused most often by Candida species, and are often associated with indwelling central venous catheters [21\u201324]. With the exception of Fusarium species, invasive mold infections seldom cause fungemia [25, 26]. A small proportion of bacteremic infections are caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria [27].\n",

            "text": "The microorganisms isolated most often from neutropenic patients are listed in Table 1.2. The most commonly isolated organisms isolated overall are the coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) [38]. These organisms are generally of low virulence and seldom cause serious or life-threatening infections. Catheter-related bacteremias are the most common infections caused by CoNS. These can often be treated with antimicrobial agents without removal of the offending catheter, although some infections may recur if the catheter is retained [39]. The one exception is Staphylococcus lugdunensis, which resembles S. aureus in virulence, and infections caused by this species need to be managed like those caused by S. aureus [40\u201342]. Other gram-positive organisms that frequently colonize human skin and often cause infections in patients with leukemia include Bacillus species, Corynebacterium species, and Micrococcus species [43\u201349]. Like CoNS, the most common infection caused by these organisms is catheter-related bacteremia. Occasionally more serious infections such as pneumonia, endocarditis, endophthalmitis, and meningitis develop. The organisms are uniformly susceptible to vancomycin, linezolid, and daptomycin, whereas susceptibility to other agents is variable. Most patients respond to appropriate antimicrobial therapy, and infection-related mortality is low. It is not clear whether removal of the infected catheter is always necessary for response; however, recurrent infections seem to be more frequent if the catheter is retained [45, 48, 50]. As mentioned earlier, infections caused by S. aureus are more virulent and are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality [51]. In some cancer treatment centers, ~40\u201360 % of these organisms may be methicillin resistant, although institutional and regional differences do occur, with resistance rates <10 % in the Netherlands or Scandinavian countries. Some of these isolates have also developed tolerance or reduced susceptibility to vancomycin (the so-called MIC creep), and slow response to, or overt failure of vancomycin therapy has been reported especially in infections caused by organisms with vancomycin MICs of >1.0/ml [51\u201356]. In a recent study of MRSA bacteremia in cancer patients from a comprehensive cancer center, a high treatment failure rate for vancomycin (52 %) was demonstrated, and a vancomycin MIC of >2/ml was found to be an independent factor for vancomycin failure [57]. Based on this and similar reports, the current recommendation is to consider therapy with alternative agents such as linezolid or daptomycin for infections caused by organisms with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin [58\u201360].\n",

For many years, they were considered contaminants or organisms of low virulence, even in neutropenic patients. However, subsequent clinical experience has shown that they are responsible for serious, life-threatening infections in this patient population [61, 62]. The most consistent predisposing factor for infection by these organisms appears to be high-dose chemotherapy with agents such as cytosine arabinoside that induce severe mucosal damage, thereby facilitating entry of these organisms into the bloodstream [63]. Other probable predisposing factors include antimicrobial prophylaxis with fluoroquinolones that might encourage selection and overgrowth of these organisms and treatment of chemotherapy-induced gastritis with antacids or histamine type 2 (H2) antagonists [64\u201366]. Streptococcus mitis, S. sanguis, and S. salivarius are the predominant species [18, 67]. Bacteremia is the most common manifestation. In some patients, a rapidly progressive and disseminated infection (sometimes referred to as the streptococcal toxic shock syndrome) occurs involving the bloodstream, lungs, central nervous system, and skin [68]. Despite prompt and aggressive antimicrobial therapy, the mortality associated with this syndrome is 25\u201335 %. Of increasing concern are reports that 20\u201360 % of VGS are non-susceptible or overtly resistant to penicillin [18, 68]. This has limited the utility of penicillin G and other penicillins for the prevention and treatment of these infections. All isolates are currently susceptible to vancomycin, although tolerance has been described [18, 69\u201372]. The use of antibiotic combinations may be necessary, especially against tolerant organisms. These organisms are also susceptible to the newer-generation quinolones (e.g., moxifloxacin), daptomycin, and linezolid, but clinical experience with these agents is limited.",

They are seldom primary pathogens but are seen most often following prolonged therapy with broad-spectrum cephalosporins or carbapenems to which they are intrinsically resistant. Increased use of vancomycin especially in neutropenic cancer patients was at least in part responsible for the emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) globally, and these organisms now account for 15\u201330 % of all enterococcal isolates [4]. Fecal colonization with VRE is not uncommon in patients with acute leukemia and recipients of stem cell transplantation [73, 74]. Approximately 30 % of patients with VRE fecal colonization will go on to develop bacteremia or other significant infections with these organisms following chemotherapy, and some experts recommend the empiric use of agents with activity against VRE when such patients develop fever during an episode of neutropenia [10, 75]. Attempts at eradicating fecal colonization with VRE have been singularly unsuccessful. Consequently, infection control measures to reduce transmission of VRE are of overriding importance.",

The use of antibacterial prophylaxis in high-risk patients including those with acute leukemia has led to a reduction in the frequency of documented gram-negative infections, although some centers are reporting a reversal of this trend [19, 20]. Nevertheless, gram-negative infections, when they do occur, are generally associated with greater morbidity and mortality than infections caused by their gram-positive counterparts. Multiple surveillance studies have shown that E. coli, Klebsiella spp., and P. aeruginosa remain the three most commonly isolated gram-negative organisms from neutropenic patients and collectively cause 65\u201375 % of microbiologically documented gram-negative infections [76\u201379]. Other Enterobacteriaceae such as Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter spp., Serratia spp., and Proteus spp. are less common, although institutional differences do exist. Despite the overall decline in the frequency of gram-negative infections in neutropenic patients, there has been an increase in the proportion of such infections caused by non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli (NFGNB) such as Acinetobacter spp., non-aeruginosa Pseudomonas spp., and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia [80]. Collectively, NFGNB now cause ~38 % of documented gram-negative infections, a proportion that has gradually increased over the years. The overall spectrum of infections caused by gram-negative bacilli is wide, with pneumonia, primary and catheter-related bacteremia, and urinary tract infection being common \u2013 Table 1.3.\n",

            "text": "\nP. aeruginosa is the most frequently isolated and the most important pathogenic NFGNB in this setting and causes between 15 and 20 % of all gram-negative infections [13\u201316]. Additionally, it is the most common gram-negative organism isolated from polymicrobial infections [11, 12]. These organisms have the propensity for developing resistance to antimicrobial agents by multiple mechanisms [81, 82]. A recent study demonstrated that the risk factors associated with multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa infections were the use of a carbapenem as monotherapy for >7 days, a history of P. aeruginosa infection in the preceding year, and a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [83]. Consequently, the antimicrobial stewardship program at our institution has targeted the prolonged use of carbapenem monotherapy, with a resultant decrease in the frequency of infections with MDR P. aeruginosa [84]. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia colonization/infection rates in neutropenic patients, especially those with acute leukemia and recipients of HSC transplantation, have increased considerably over the past two to three decades. Surveillance studies conducted at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center have documented an increase in the proportion of S. maltophilia from 2 % of all gram-negative bacilli isolated in 1986 to 7 % in 2012. Patients with prolonged neutropenia, those exposed to broad-spectrum antibiotics, especially the carbapenems, and those requiring mechanical ventilation have a higher risk of infection, although these infections are also seen in patients without traditional risk factors [85, 86]. The shift from trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) which has potent activity against S. maltophilia) to the fluoroquinolones (which are much less active against S. maltophilia) as the preferred agents for antimicrobial prophylaxis in high-risk neutropenic patients may also have contributed to the increase in infections caused by these organisms. TMP/SMX has been and remains the agent of choice for the treatment of infections caused by S. maltophilia, but in vitro resistance to it appears to be increasing [85, 87]. Ticarcillin/clavulanate also has reliable activity, whereas other beta-lactams such as ceftazidime, cefepime, and piperacillin/tazobactam have variable activity against these organisms. The newer quinolones such as moxifloxacin are more active than older agents such as ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin [80]. Minocycline and the novel glycylcycline \u2013 tigecycline, are also active against many S. maltophilia isolates [88]. Clinical experience with agents other than TMP/SMX and ticarcillin/clavulanate is limited. Combination regimens based on the susceptibility of individual isolates are often employed [89].",

Most HSV and VZV infections in this setting result from reactivation of the latent viruses from previous exposure, and primary infections are rare [141, 142]. Most US adults are HSV-1 or HSV-2 seropositive, and reactivation can occur in up to 60 % of patients undergoing intensive chemotherapy for hematologic malignancies. Reactivation usually occurs soon after chemotherapy, while patients are still severely neutropenic, and much of the morbidity caused by oral mucositis has been attributed to HSV reactivation in this setting. Consequently, several guidelines recommend HSV prophylaxis in patients undergoing HSCT or remission induction therapy for leukemia [10, 143]. Reactivation of latent VZV also occurs but to a lesser extent, and the risk is considered insufficient to warrant routine prophylaxis.",

            "text": "Over the past two decades, the importance of community respiratory viruses as significant causes of morbidity and mortality in HSCT recipients and patients with hematologic malignancies has been recognized [144\u2013150]. These include human influenza viruses (A and B), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human parainfluenzae viruses, human metapneumovirus, human coronaviruses, and human rhinoviruses. Many of these (e.g., the influenza viruses and RSV) have a seasonal preponderance, although some are encountered year round. Upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) predominate, with rhinorrhea being the most common manifestation. Progression to lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) can lead to respiratory failure and a fatal outcome depending on host factors and the intrinsic virulence of specific viruses. Testing for respiratory viruses is recommended in high-risk patients. Specimens for diagnostic testing include nasopharyngeal swabs, washes, or aspirates, tracheal aspirates, and bronchoalveolar lavage specimens. Laboratory tests include nucleic acid amplification testing, direct antigen detection, and isolation of the virus by cell culture. Optimum therapy for most of these infections remains to be determined (except for human influenza viruses). Pooling of published studies from various centers in the absence of sufficiently powered, randomized, controlled trials, suggests that treatment of LRTI with ribavirin and intravenous immunoglobulin may improve outcome in RSV infections [151]. This approach is also used to prevent the development of LRTI in HSCT recipients with URTI.",
