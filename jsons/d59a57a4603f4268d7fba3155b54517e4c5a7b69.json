Furthermore, reproduction efforts, for the most part, need to start \"from scratch\", with a completely independent set of experiments. Although further studies refine our understanding over time (e.g., Newton's vs. Einstein's perspective on gravity), subsequent experiments are usually driven by new research questions, and cannot be considered reproduction efforts per se.",

We present two compelling scenarios: First, findings in the computational sciences are always couched in some computational context. Take a simple example: algorithm A is faster than algorithm B, but the experiments were conducted on magnetic disks. With memory-resident data structures, does the finding still hold? Verification of results should be a continual process as computational contexts change: the shift from magnetic disks to SSDs, the advent of multi-core computing, etc. Although we do not undertake such an examination in this paper due to limited space, being able to replicate results using old computational artifacts is a pre-requisite. Second, another compelling scenario is long-term software preservation [11] , especially for artifacts that have historical value, in the same way that there is active interest in preserving old video games today. For example, the SMART system [14] might fall into this category.",

We grapple with issues that are under-explored in the community-for example, our questions do not naturally fit into the Platform, Research goal, Implementation, Method, Actor, and Data (PRIMAD) model [6] that attempts to capture the multi-faceted aspects of reproducibility. Of course, platforms change over time, but this change is an inevitable consequence of the passage of time; in other words, \"platform\" is a dependent variable, not an independent variable, in our conception. PRIMAD implicitly assumes a static view of reproducibility, as opposed to the processoriented view we advocate. More concretely, from the successes as well as failures in replicating OSIRRC 2015, we are able to extract a number of \"lessons learned\" that can be further distilled into best practices, especially to inform ongoing efforts such as the latest iteration of OSIRRC [3] .",

Our experiments put these claims to the test. We cloned the git repository 2 and proceeded to run the dotgov2.sh script associated with each system after changing the location of the document collection in a common settings script. As designed, the single script should handle all aspects of producing an ad hoc experimental run from scratch, including building the inverted index, performing retrieval, and using trec eval to generate effectiveness figures. In a few cases, the script worked exactly \"as is\", but more often than not, we encountered failures, which we then spent some time debugging (details below).",

In many cases, the correspondence between figures in the paper and execution traces of the computational artifacts (even when successful) was not clear. As a simple example, Table 1 originally contained an \"All\" column, which, inexplicably, does not simply appear to be the average of each set of topics. The execution trace of each dotgov2.sh script was different: some printed out AP scores directly to stdout; others didn't, and silently completed execution. In the latter cases, it was necessary to dig through system outputs to find the actual scores; the fact that each system used completely different naming conventions for output runs, evaluation results, and log files made this task non-trivial. Due to space restrictions, we focused on replicating effectiveness results in this paper, but OSIRRC 2015 also evaluated index size and query latency. However, the repository offered few details on how to extract figures corresponding to those reported in the paper. As one example, it wasn't clear where each system stored its index: some were contained in directories, some were single files, and others were groups of files (and in many cases, not intuitively named).",

As the saying goes, \"change is the only constant\", and computing platforms inevitably evolve, often in non-compatible ways: the two poignant examples here being JVM differences and compiler differences. Unlike external dependencies discussed above, it would be impractical to directly store and manage platform dependencies inside the OSIRRC 2015 repository, but here the use of Docker in OSIRRC 2019 represents an improvement. Docker allows platforms to be isolated in \"layers\" that can be composed to form images in a lightweight manner (compared to VMs); images themselves can be stored at stable locations (for example, in Docker Hub). Admittedly, this design does not guard against the obsolescence of Docker itself; despite the popularity of Docker today, one day it too will be superseded by new practices.",
