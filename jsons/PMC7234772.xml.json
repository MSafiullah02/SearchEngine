By the time this Editor's Page is published, there will have been many more developments that could make this particular contribution to the Journal irrelevant. But perhaps not. We are working hard at the Journal to keep up with submissions and to obtain reviews; it's not an easy task given that so many of us are fully engaged in management of Covid-related issues \u201cevery day, all day\u201d. We applaud our reviewers who continue to provide us with quality reviews and our associate editors and statistical consultants who, under historic pressure, still provide service to the Journal and, by extension, the Heart Failure Society of America and the heart failure community at large.",

It might be helpful to read many of his speeches, including those dating back to the 1920s, when he sensed that the world was changing and that it would become necessary to fight an evil that was soon to be unleashed. He would tell us today to be steadfast. Recall that Londoners spent many a night in the \u201ctubes\u201d during the Battle of Britain bombings of 1940 and then went to work in the morning. And now, as health care professionals, we go to work to face uncertainty but do so in order to live up to our commitments to care for people. Heart failure care does not stop because of COVID-19 and it is likely that our routine care can help to save patients from decompensation that puts them at greater risk should they be exposed to the virus. We will soon learn the extent to which there are direct and indirect cardiac effects related to COVID-19 infection; for example, myocarditis may be an important clinical issue. We also take note of the joint statement by the HFSA, American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology that we have published in the current issue; we certainly appreciate the need to learn more about the virus.",

At the Journal, we wish for all of you and your families the utmost of health and safety, and a rapid return to normalcy. In heart failure, we have many questions to answer and a lot of progress to make. Let us come together as a community and ensure that it happens.",
