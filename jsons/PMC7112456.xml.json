For instance, Funk et al.18 studied the impacts of awareness spread on both epidemic threshold\nand prevalence, and they found that, in a well-mixed population, spread of awareness can\nreduce the prevalence of epidemic but does not tend to affect the epidemic threshold, yet\nthe epidemic threshold is altered when considering on social networks; Sahneh et\nal. considered a Susceptible-Alter-Infected-Susceptible (SAIS)\nmodel,19 and they found that the way of\nbehavioral response can enhance the epidemic threshold; Meloni et al.\nconstructed a meta-population model incorporating several scenarios of self-initiated\nbehavioral changes into the mobility patterns of individuals, and they found that such\nbehavioral changes do not alter the epidemic threshold, but may increase rather than\ndecrease the prevalence of epidemic.20\nMeanwhile, in Ref. 21, by designing the transmission\nrate of epidemic as a function of the local infected density or the global infected density,\nWu et al. investigated the effect of such a behavioral response on the\nepidemic threshold.",

However, the network structure was not incorporated into these\nmodels. As we know, when the model is considered within the network based framework, new\ntheoretical tools should be used and new phenomena may be observed. In view of this, we\nincorporate the network structure into the SSFIR model23 to investigate its spreading dynamics. In\nthe model, when contacting an infectious neighbor, susceptible individuals may be infected\n(from S state I state) with a transmission rate, or a\nbehavioral response may be triggered (from S state to\nSF state) with a response rate. We provide a theoretical\nformula for the epidemic threshold as well as the prevalence of epidemic via the percolation\nmethod,5 our results show that the\nintroduction of SF class can enhance the epidemic threshold and\nreduce the prevalence of epidemic. We also demonstrate that a wrong result can be\nobtained\u2014the introduction of SF class cannot alter the epidemic\nthreshold when using mean field method to such a model. The reasons are presented in Sec.\nV.",
