With insufficient preparation, healthcare providers are facing high volume of severely ill patients requiring advanced life-sustaining treatments (LSTs) in intensive care units (ICUs). Many of these patients are unable to communicate consistently, if at all, with their ICU medical teams due to work of breathing from respiratory failure, mechanical ventilation to support respiratory failure, or delirium associated with their severity of illness. Isolation precautions-necessary to mediate infection rates-have led to devastating realities and communication challenges for patients and their families kept physically separated from each other, giving rise to great fear and suffering. We offer several practical and actionable communication strategies to offset these burdens among isolated COVID-19 patients and their families.",

Admission to the ICU is a frightening experience, but timely and effective communication among patients, families, and health care workers (HCWs) can lessen fears, even if only by acknowledging they exist. 1 Under pandemic conditions, communication may be overlooked by HCWs due to the prioritization of life-sustaining needs. The absence of a loved one at the bedside, typically serving as the patient's advocate and as a potent reminder of the patient as a whole person rather than solely as a critically ill patient, may also contribute to HCWs overlooking the communications needs of patients and their loved ones. Earliest possible and then routine assessment of patient and family information needs and preferences can relieve psychological suffering and enable more familiar exchanges as important medical decision-making proceeds.",

Frequency and modality of communication can then be addressed, i.e., telephone or video conferencing using computer or smart phone apps. ICU teams should establish which team member(s) will be responsible for which types of communication. For example, a daily check-in might be scheduled in lieu of the standard practice of informal check-ins during family visits. The ICU team should plan which team member(s) will be the primary outreach representative each day and assure flexibility to respond to family-initiated communication requests as a team when bedside providers cannot respond immediately.",

Crisis standards of care are necessary when the demand for LSTs and healthcare resources far exceed supplies (e.g., ventilators, dialysis machines, nursing staff) despite adaptations and expansions under contingency standards. Crisis standards prioritize population health ethics, assuring justice, transparency, and equity with the allocation of LST resources to patients most likely to survive to hospital discharge (vs. providing LSTs to any patient who wishes to receive them under standard and even contingency standards). Decisions to shift to these different standards of care are not made lightly and are not made at the individual provider or even individual hospital level, but instead are made jointly across states or regions. It is important for healthcare systems to consider how to best share changes in care standards with ICU patients and families, maintaining a balance between keeping them informed and minimizing the stress and alarm that such decisions may cause.",
