            "text": "Many progresses in the understanding of epidemic spreading models have been obtained thanks to numerous modeling efforts and analytical and numerical studies, considering host populations with very different structures and properties, including complex and temporal interaction networks. Moreover, a number of recent studies have started to go beyond the assumption of an absence of coupling between the spread of a disease and the structure of the contacts on which it unfolds. Models including awareness of the spread have been proposed, to mimic possible precautionary measures taken by individuals that decrease their risk of infection, but have mostly considered static networks. Here, we adapt such a framework to the more realistic case of temporal networks of interactions between individuals. We study the resulting model by analytical and numerical means on both simple models of temporal networks and empirical time-resolved contact data. Analytical results show that the epidemic threshold is not affected by the awareness but that the prevalence can be significantly decreased. Numerical studies on synthetic temporal networks highlight, however, the presence of very strong finite-size effects, resulting in a significant shift of the effective epidemic threshold in the presence of risk awareness. For empirical contact networks, the awareness mechanism leads as well to a shift in the effective threshold and to a strong reduction of the epidemic prevalence.",

The simplest homogeneous mixing assumption, which makes many analytical results achievable, considers that individuals are identical and that each has a uniform probability of being in contact with any other individual [1, 2] . Even within this crude approximation, it is possible to highlight fundamental aspects of epidemic spreading, such as the epidemic threshold, signaling a nonequilibrium phase transition that separates an epidemic-free phase from a phase in which a finite fraction of the population is affected [1] . However, this approach neglects any nontrivial structure of the contacts, while advances in network science [3] have shown that many networks of interest have in common important features such as a strong heterogeneity in the number of connections, a large number of triads, community structures, and a low average shortest path length between individuals [3, 4] . Spreading models have thus been adapted to complex networks, unveiling the important role of these properties [5] [6] [7] . More recently, a number of studies have also considered spreading processes on time-varying networks [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] , to take into account the fact that contact networks evolve on various timescales and present nontrivial temporal properties such as broad distribution of contact durations [14, 15] and burstiness [8, 16] (i.e., the timeline of social interactions of a given individual exhibits periods of time with intense activity separated by long quiescent periods with no interactions).",

            "text": "All these modeling approaches consider that the propagation of the disease takes place on a substrate (the contacts between individuals) that does not depend on the disease itself. In this framework, standard containment measures consist in the immunization of individuals, to effectively remove them from the population and thus break propagation paths. Immunization can also (in models) be performed in a targeted way, trying to identify the most important (class of) spreaders and to suppress propagation in the most efficient possible way [17, 18] . An important point to consider, however, is that the structure and properties of contacts themselves can in fact be affected by the presence of the disease in the population, as individuals aware of the disease can modify their behavior spontaneously, adopting self-protecting measures, such as vaccination or mask-wearing. A number of studies have considered this issue along several directions (see Ref. [19] for a review). For instance, some works consider an adaptive evolution of the network [20] with probabilistic redirection of links between susceptible and infectious individuals, to mimic the fact that a susceptible individual might be aware of the infectious state of some of his/her neighbors, and therefore try to avoid contact with them. Such models can lead to a rich phenomenology, with first order transitions, oscillations, and hysteresis phenomena. Other works introduce behavioral classes in the population, depending on the awareness to the disease [21] , possibly considering that the awareness of the disease propagates on a different (static) network than the disease itself, and that being aware of the disease implies a certain level of immunity to it [22, 23] . The epidemic threshold depends then on the topology of the network on which the awareness propagates.",

Different model definitions can lead to contrasting results. For instance, reducing the probability of being infected according to the instantaneous fraction of infected neighbors of an individual leads to a notable increase of the epidemic threshold and a decay of the prevalence [24] . On the other hand, in Ref. [25] , the epidemic threshold stays unchanged when the infection probability is reduced according to a local epidemic incidence obtained by memorizing the past contacts with other infectious neighbors, although the prevalence is also significantly reduced in this case. Both these studies consider diseases propagating on static contact networks and local awareness effects. In contrast, Refs. [26, 27] investigate the case of a temporal network in which awareness has the very strong and global effect of reducing uniformly the activity of all individuals and their numbers of contacts, either because they are infectious or because of a global knowledge of the overall incidence of the disease. Under those assumptions of a global, nonlocal awareness effect, both the epidemic threshold and the disease prevalence are notably affected.",

We do not assume any knowledge of the overall incidence, which is usually very difficult to know in a real epidemic, especially in real time. We consider standard models of infectious diseases and both empirical and synthetic temporal networks of contacts. We extend the concept of awareness with respect to the state of neighbors from static to temporal networks and perform extensive numerical simulations to uncover the change in the phase diagram (epidemic threshold and fraction of individuals affected by the disease) as the parameters describing the reaction of the individuals are varied.",

It is therefore unable to reproduce a number of features observed in empirical data. An extension of the model tackles this issue by introducing a memory effect into the mechanism of link creation [30] . In the resulting activity-driven model with memory (ADM), each individual keeps track of the set of other individuals with whom there has been an interaction in the past. At each time step t we start as in the AD model with N disconnected individuals, and each individual i becomes active with probability a i . For each link created by an active individual i, the link goes with probability p = q i (t)/[q i (t) + 1] to one of the q i (t) individuals previously encountered by i, and with probability 1 \u2212 p toward a never-encountered one. In this way, contacts with alreadyencountered other individuals have a larger probability to be repeated and are reinforced. As a result, for a power-law distributed activity F (a), the degree distribution of the temporal network aggregated on a time window T becomes narrow, while the distribution of weights (defined as the number of interactions between two individuals) becomes broad [30] .",

A susceptible individual in contact with an infectious becomes infectious at a given constant rate, while each infectious recovers from infection at another constant rate. In the SIR case, infectious individuals enter the recovered (R) compartment and cannot become infectious anymore. We consider a discrete time modeling approach, in which the contacts between individuals are given by a temporal network encoded in a time-dependent adjacency matrix A ij (t) taking value 1 if individuals i and j are in contact at time t, and 0 otherwise.

The competition between the transmission and recovery mechanisms determines the epidemic threshold. Indeed, if \u03bb is not large enough to compensate the recovery process (\u03bb/\u03bc smaller than a critical value), the epidemic outbreak will not affect a finite portion of the population, dying out rapidly. On the other hand, if \u03bb/\u03bc is large enough, the spread can lead in the SIS model to a nonequilibrium stationary state, which we determine with an average over surviving runs, and in which a finite fraction of the population is in the infectious state. For the SIR model, on the other hand, the epidemic threshold is determined by the fact that the fraction r \u221e = R \u221e /N of individuals in the recovered state at the end of the spread becomes finite for \u03bb/\u03bc larger than the threshold.",

Below the epidemic threshold, realizations have a finite lifetime and the coverage goes to 0 in the thermodynamic limit. Above threshold, the system in the thermodynamic limit has a finite probability to reach an endemic stationary state, with infinite lifetime and coverage going to 1, while realizations that do not reach the stationary state have a finite lifetime. The threshold is therefore found as the value of \u03bb/\u03bc where the average lifetime of nonendemic realizations diverges. For finite systems, one can operationally define an arbitrary maximum coverage C > 0 (for instance C = 0.5) above which a realization is considered endemic, and look for the peak in the average lifetime of nonendemic realizations as a function of \u03bb/\u03bc. In the SIR model the lifetime of any realization is finite.

We consider that longer contacts with infectious individuals should have a stronger influence on a susceptible individual's awareness, and that the overall effect on any individual depends on the ratio of the time spent in contact with infectious to the total time spent in contact with other individuals. Indeed, two individuals spending a given amount of time in contact with infectious individuals may react differently depending on whether these contacts represent a large fraction of their total number of contacts or not. We moreover argue that the awareness is influenced only by recent contacts, as having encountered ill individuals in a distant past is less susceptible to lead to a change of behavior.

            "text": "In Fig. 1 we first explore the effect of the strength of risk awareness, as measured by the parameter \u03b1, in the case T = \u221e, i.e., when each agent is influenced by the whole history of his/her past contacts, a situation in which awareness effects should be maximal. We plot the steady-state average fraction of infectious nodes \u03c1 = a \u03c1 a F (a) as a function of \u03b2/\u03bc for three different values of \u03b1, and evaluate the position of the effective epidemic threshold, as measured by the peak of the average lifetime of nonendemic realizations; see Sec. III A. Figures 1(c) and 1(d) indicate that the effect of awareness in the model (\u03b1 > 0), with respect to the pure SIS model (\u03b1 = 0) is to reduce the fraction \u03c1 of infectious individuals for all values of \u03b2/\u03bc, and Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) seem to indicate in addition a shift of the effective epidemic threshold to larger values. This effect is more pronounced for the ADM than for the AD networks. As this shift of the epidemic threshold is in contradiction, at least for the AD case, with the mean-field analysis of the previous paragraphs, we investigate this issue in more details in Fig. 2 , where we show, both for the pure SIS model (\u03b1 = 0) and for a positive value of \u03b1, the average lifetime of nonendemic realizations for various system sizes. Strong finite-size effects are observed, especially for the model with awareness (\u03b1 > 0). In Fig. 3 , we plot the fitting of the values of the effective threshold (\u03b2/\u03bc) c (the position of the lifetime peak) with a law of the form (\u03b2/\u03bc) c,N = (\u03b2/\u03bc) c,\u221e + A N \u2212\u03bd , typical of finite-size scaling analysis [39] . In the thermodynamic limit of (\u03b2/\u03bc) c,\u221e = 0.37 (3) for the pure SIS model on AD networks, (\u03b2/\u03bc) c,\u221e = 0.34(2) for AD with \u03b1 = 10 (SIS model with awareness), (\u03b2/\u03bc) c,\u221e = 0.29(3) for ADM with \u03b1 = 0 (pure SIS model), and (\u03b2/\u03bc) c,\u221e = 0.29(2) for ADM with \u03b1 = 10. We notice here that the extrapolations for \u03b1 = 0 are less accurate and thus with larger associated errors. Nevertheless, with the evidence at hand, we can conclude that, within error bars, the risk perception has no effect on the epidemic threshold in the thermodynamic limit, in agreement with the result from Eq. (12) , that gives a theoretical threshold (\u03b2/\u03bc) c = 0.366 for the AD case. It is however noteworthy that the effective epidemic threshold measured in finite systems can be quite strongly affected by the awareness mechanism, even for quite large systems, and in a particularly dramatic way for ADM networks. We finally explore in Fig. 4 the effect of a varying memory length T , at fixed risk awareness strength \u03b1. In both AD and ADM networks, an increasing awareness temporal window shifts the effective epidemic threshold towards larger values, up to a maximum given by T = \u221e, when the whole system history is available. For the ADM networks, this effect is less clear because of the changing height of the maximum of the lifespan when increasing T . For AD networks, this result is apparently at odds with the mean-field analysis in which T is irrelevant in the stationary state. We should notice, however, that for T \u2192 \u221e, the critical point is unchanged in the thermodynamic limit with respect to the pure SIS dynamics. Given that for T \u2192 \u221e the effects of awareness are the strongest, we expect that a finite T will not be able to change the threshold in the infinite network limit. We can thus attribute the shifts observed to pure finite-size effects. Note that this effect is also seen in homogeneous AD networks with uniform activity a (data not shown), observation that we can explain as follows: when T is small, the ratio of contacts with infectious n I (i) T recorded by an individual i can differ significantly from the overall ratio recorded in the whole network in the same time window, which is equal to n I (i) T = \u03c1 (for a uniform activity). Mathematically, we have",

The spread starts with a fraction \u03c1 0 = I 0 /N = 0.01 of infectious nodes chosen at random in the population and the activity distribution is the same as in the SIS case. In the present simulations the memory span T is infinite and we compare the results obtained for two different values of the awareness strength \u03b1.

(21) . In Fig. 6 we explore the effects of the initial density \u03c1 0 = I 0 /N of infectious individuals on the effect of awareness on AD networks. For large values of \u03c1 0 = I 0 /N , the awareness (\u03b1 > 0) can significantly decrease the final epidemic size, as already observed in Fig. 5 . This effect can be understood by the fact that, for large \u03c1 0 , more individuals are aware already from the start of the spread and have therefore lower probabilities to be infected. At very small initial densities, on the other hand, r \u221e becomes independent of \u03b1. This is at odds with the result in Eq. (21) , which, however, was obtained within an approximation that increases the effects of awareness. The milder form considered in Eq. (2) leads instead to an approximately unaltered threshold, and to a prevalence independent of \u03b1.",

We can see that an important reduction of the prevalence is occurring even for T = 1. This is due to the presence of many contacts of duration longer than T (contrarily to the AD case): the awareness mechanism decreases the probability of contagion of all these contacts (and in particular of the contacts with very long duration, which have an important role in the propagation) as soon as T > 1, leading to a strong effect even in this case. At large values of the control parameter \u03b2/\u03bc, the effect of the awareness is stronger for increasing values of the memory length T , as was observed in Sec. IV A. At small values of \u03b2/\u03bc on the contrary, the awareness is optimum for a finite value of T , and the knowledge of the whole contact history is not the best way to contain the epidemics. While a detailed investigation of this effect lies beyond the scope of our work, preliminary work (not shown) seem to indicate that it is linked to the use of the periodicity introduced in the data through the repetition of the dataset.",

(1). In Figs. 9 and 10 we plot \u03c3 r and r \u221e for different memory length T , for the SFHH conference and the Thiers highschool data, respectively. We first notice that a notable effect appears already for T = 1, similarly to the SIS process. However, we see that r \u221e is monotonously reduced as T grows and that the effective threshold is shifted to higher values of \u03b2/\u03bc, also monotonously. It is worth noticing that the timescale of the SIR process is much smaller than the one studied in the SIS process because the final state is an absorbing state free of infectious agents. The lifetime of the epidemic in this case is of the order of magnitude of the data duration, so that the periodicity introduced by the repetition of the dataset is not relevant anymore. Overall, we observe for both networks an important reduction of outbreak size when people adopt a self protecting behavior, as well as a significant shift of the effective epidemic threshold.",

In this context, we have implemented a model including awareness to the propagating disease in a temporal network, extending previous approaches defined for static frameworks. In our model, susceptible individuals have a local perception of the overall disease prevalence measured as the ratio of the number of previous contacts with infectious individuals on a training window of width T . An increased level of awareness induces a reduction in the probability that a susceptible individual contracts the disease via a contact with an infectious individual.",

These empirical networks differ from the network models from two crucial points of view. On the one hand, they have a relatively small size. Given that important finite-size effects are observed in the models, especially in the one with memory effects, one might also expect stronger effective shifts in such populations of limited size. On the other hand, AD and ADM networks lack numerous realistic features observed in real social systems. On AD and ADM networks, contacts are established with random nodes (even in the ADM case) so that the perception of the density of infectious by any node is quite homogeneous, at least in the hypothesis of a sufficiently large number of contacts recorded (i.e., at large enough times, for a T 1). This is not the case for the empirical networks, which exhibits complex patterns such as community structures, as well as broad distributions of contact and inter-contact durations, specific time-scales (e.g., lunch breaks), correlated activity patterns, etc. [42] . This rich topological and temporal structure can lead to strong heterogeneities in the local perception of the disease. In this respect, it would be interesting to investigate the effect of awareness in more realistic temporal network models.",
