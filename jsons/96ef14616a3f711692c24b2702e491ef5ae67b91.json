            "text": "Background/objectives Clinical risks and advantages of both continuous feeding and intermittent feeding for preterm infants have been presented in previous studies. To determine the most appropriate feeding method for low-birth-weight infants, a meta-analysis was conducted. Subjects/methods Articles related to this topic were searched in PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library electronic database from the onset to May 2019. Heterogeneity analysis was performed with Chi-square and I 2 test. Pooled analysis was based on fixed effects model, if heterogeneity between the eligible studies was negligible (I 2 < 50%, P > 0.05). In contrast, a random effects model was carried out. The quality of including studies were evaluated by Cochrane assessment tool. Results A total of 1030 articles identified. Altogether, eight articles including 707 infants were included in final analysis based on eligibility criteria. In continuous feeding infants, time to achieving full feeds was longer (weight mean difference 0.98 (95% CI 0.26-1.71, P = 0.008) days) compared with intermittent feeding infants. Pooled analysis indicated there were no significant difference in other variables such as feeding intolerance, duration of hospitalization, days to regain birth weight, days to first successful oral feeding, duration of parenteral feeding, weight growth, length increment, head circumference growth, proven necrotizing enterocolitis, and probable necrotizing enterocolitis. In subgroup analysis for birth weight (<1000 g and >1000 g), we did not identify significant difference in time to full feeds, time to regain birth weight, and duration of hospitalization. Conclusions Intermittent feeding may be more beneficial for low-birth weight infants, However, well-designed studies and evidenced-based clinical practice are required to determine the most appropriate feeding method for premature infants with low birth weight.",

Only from approximately 32 weeks age or 1500 g body weight, infants are able to coordinate sucking, swallowing, and breathing and the danger of aspiration, allowing drinking milk without danger [2] . Generally, tube feeding consists of continuous feeding and intermittent bolus feeding. Continuous feeding is defined as delivering enteral nutrition with constant speed for 24 h via nutritional pump [2, 3] . Intermittent bolus feeding is defined as delivering enteral nutrition multiple times [4] , generally giving 15-30 min every 2-3 h by gravity or electric pump.",

            "text": "Previous studies have found that both continuous feeding and intermittent bolus feeding have benefits and risks for preterm infants. On the one hand, continuous feeding can maintain the gastrointestinal hormonal such as gastrin and insulin at a high level [5] , leading to the increase of absorption and reduction of energy expenditure [6] . On the other hand, continuous infusion of milk into the infant's gastrointestinal tract may lead to disorders of gastrointestinal hormones and long-term growth inhibition. A study on animal models suggested that continuous feeding, comparing with intermittent bolus feeding, reduces glucagon like peptide-1, which may contribute to organ dysfunction [7] . In addition, the incidence of prolonged apnea and apnea related hypoxia diseases such as retinopathy [8] in continuous feeding is significantly higher than that in intermittent feeding [5] . Regarding to intermittent bolus feeding, it was thought to more physiologic [9] , making infants have cyclical surges of gastrin, gastric inhibitory peptide, and insulin, therefore, promoting the gastrointestinal tract development [9] . Moreover, intermittent feeding allows more parental involvement in feeding [10] and splanchnic perfusion [11] . Moreover, intermittent feeding promotes protein synthesis and improves the whole body's protein balance [12, 13] , which play an important role in regulating nutritional disorders in infants. However, for premature infants, intermittent milk feeding may lead to feeding intolerance because it is easy for infants to exceed the absorbed capacity of their gastrointestinal tract with bolus milk infusion. Intermittent feeding also has been reported to be associated with metabolic instability [14] and impaired pulmonary functions [15] in preterm infants.",

Therefore, now it is time for an update as larger, well designed studies reported on the effect of continuous feeding and intermittent feeding in preterm infants have appeared after 2011 [10, 11, 20, 21] .

In this study, feeding performance mainly included five outcomes: days to full enteral feeds, days to regain birth weight, days to first successful oral feeding, duration of hospitalization, and duration of supplement parenteral nutrition. The weight mean difference of days to full enteral feeds was 0.98 (95% CI 0.26-1.71, P = 0.008) days in all infants ( Table 2) . No significant weight mean difference in other four variables were found between continuous feeding group and intermittent bolus feeding group of all infants. In somatic growth, we did not detect the significant difference in weight growth, length increment, and head circumference growth. As well, no significant were detected in utilization of medical resources (duration of hospitalization), feeding intolerance, and complication (proven or probable NEC). We conducted subgroup analysis for birth weight of outcomes. A total of four studies were included [10, 15, 18, 35] . All infants were divided into groups of <1000 g and >1000 g. However, in subgroup analysis and pooled analysis, we did not find significant difference in days to full enteral feeds, regain birth weight, and duration of hospitalization.

However, our results were different from Dsilna's [18] findings, which displayed that continuous feeding infants achieve full feeds faster than intermittent feeding infants (aHR = 1.84, 95% CI 1.03-3.27), especially in infants with birth weight \u2264850 g (aHR = 4.13, 95% CI 1.48-11.53). A retrospective study conducted by Rojahn [36] also showed that continuous group had fewer days to attain full feeds. One reason for this difference may be that the characteristics of subject such as birth weight and gestational age were different. Dsilna [18] focused on infants with birth weight <1200 g and NEC necrotizing enterocolitis ** P < 0.01 Fig. 3 Pooled weight mean difference in time to achieve full feeds between the continuous feeding group and intermittent feeding group gestational age between 24 and 29 weeks. Other studies mainly focused on larger birth weight infants [10, 33] . Moreover, the feeding protocol including milk composition, starting time of enteral nutrition, and the daily increase of milk volume was different. We did not find significant difference of time to achieve full feeds in subgroup analysis for birth weight. The reason may be that only four studies included in subgroup analysis and the sample size was too small. The finding in our study suggested that intermittent bolus feeding was more preferable for infants in terms of decreasing time to attain full enteral feeds. However, further research is needed on which feeding methods are more beneficial for infants of different gestational age and birth weight.",

The inconsistence of the feeding protocols of included studies is an example of this issue. In this study, four studies did not state the strategy of continuous feeding strategy or intermittent feeding [17, 20, 33, 34] . Most studies started enteral feeding on the second to fourth day after birth [17, [33] [34] [35] . Only two studies started enteral nutrition within 30 h postnatal age [10, 18] . A recent review [37] proposed a reasonable strategy to optimize enteral feeding practice, in which the first feeding time should be started between 6 and 48 h of life, to avoid gastrointestinal atrophy and dysfunction. The Pooled weight mean difference in time to regain birth weight between the continuous feeding group and intermittent feeding group Continuous feeding versus intermittent bolus feeding for premature infants with low birth weight: a. . . studies included in this meta-analysis were mostly breastfed (from their own mother) or formula-fed. Only one study used human milk feeding only, adding frozen pasteurized human milk from the local milk bank when the milk production of the mother was inadequate [18] . A detailed review [37] presented the large number of benefits of human milk for premature infants, and advocated donor human milk can be used alternatively when human milk was inadequate. In addition, the lack of uniformity of definition of the outcome index is another issue. For example, the full enteral feeds had different definitions in different studies. Schanler [33] and Macdonald [34] defined full feeds as achieving 150 ml/kg/day, and Dsilna [18] defined full feeds as attaining 140-160 ml/kg/day. Dollberg [17] and Roverkamp-Abels [10] defined full feeds as achieving 160 ml/kg/day and 120 ml/kg/day, respectively. Akintorin [15] defined full feeds as the ability to tolerate enteral feedings of 100 kcal/kg/day for at least 48 h. Furthermore, the measure time points were different in each study. In some studies [15, 33] , researchers measured gastric residual every 2 or 3 h to maintain consistency with feeding intervals, and another part of studies [10, 18] measured gastric residual every 6-8 h, which in line with the physiological characteristics of gastrointestinal activity in infants. Birth weight, height, head circumference, and other somatic growth indicators measured daily [35] or weekly [34] .",

In addition, we selected several outcomes to evaluate the impact of the two feeding strategies on infants from five aspects, including feeding performance, somatic growth, utilization of medical resources, feeding tolerance, and complications. Our study had several limitations. First, gestational age was an additional significant variable. Nevertheless, we were unable to examine the effect of sex because there was none randomized-controlled trial reported outcomes by sex. Second, the type of gastric tube was another significant variable that we cannot detect its effect as only a limited number of studies reported outcomes by the type of gastric tube.

Clinical professions can take intermittent bolus feeding as the preferred feeding method to reduce nursing time and medical costs. Further research should have clear definition of each outcome index, stratify the birth weight, gestational age, and illness of infants', and then to determine if either feeding strategy is more beneficial for preterm infants. In addition, multicenter large sample studies, especially randomized-controlled trials, are also essential for this topic.",
