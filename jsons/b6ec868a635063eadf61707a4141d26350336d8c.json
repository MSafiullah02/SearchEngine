Limiting socioeconomic activities (SA) is among the most adopted governmental mitigating efforts to combat the transmission of the virus, though the degree varies dramatically among different regimes 2 . This study aims to quantify the contribution from the SA and weather conditions to the transmission of COVID-19 at global scale. Ruling out the unobservable factors including medical facilities and other control policies (MOC) through region-by-time fixed effects 3,4 , we show that the limiting SA has a leading contribution to lower the reproductive number by 18.3%, while weather conditions, including ultraviolet, relative humidity, and wind explain a smaller amount of variation. Temperature might have a non-monotonic impact on the transmission. We further show that in developed countries 5 and China, the SA effect is more pronounced whereas the weather effect is significantly downplayed possibly because people tend to stay indoors most of the time with a controlled climate. We finally estimate the reduced reproductive number and the population spared from infections due to restricting SA at 40,",

Furthermore, validating the model only by the records from a strictly controlled region or country (e.g. Wuhan or China) might bias the estimation of an extreme scenario with no controls.

We estimate the daily reproductive number, R0 , of COVID-19, following a widely adopted statistical approach 8, 16 which only requires the daily confirmed number of infectees 1 . R0 is an indicator of the transmissibility of a virus, representing average number of secondary infectees generated by a primary infector 17 . For R0 > 1, the number infected is likely to multiply, and for R0 < 1, transmission is likely to die out 18 . We proxy daily SA by the satellite concentration of NO2 (Sentinel-5P level-2 pollutant product) 19 because it is significanlty negatively associated with SA and available globally. The weather data are from the meteorologcial reanalysis 20 . We quantify MOC through regionalized time fixed effects. Depening on the infectee records availability, we estimate 6,386 daily R0 values from 3,315,748 confirmed cases of 213 countries or provinces/states from late January to mid April. Besides the overall contribution, we also compare the regional difference of the contribution, and the MOC evolvement. We finally estimate that compared to a hypothetical scenario with no restriction of SA, the global R0 reduction contributed by the limiting SA from late January to mid April, and the consequent spared number of infectees.",

Esimated by the product of the dependent-variable coefficient and value range over the response-variable value range, Table 1 (a) shows strongly positive contribution of SA, moderately positive and negative contribution of temperature and UV, and weakly negative contribution of windspeed and RH. Therefore, SA restriction, UV illumination, high wind and high humidity could reduce the transmission. SA has a leading contribution of 18.3%\u00b12.0% (95% Confidence Interval, CI). Sunlight kills the virus directly, increases cell cytotoxicity and modulates the biosynthesis of vitamin D which are essential to promote immune responses 21 . Higher relative humidity prevents viral particles traveling as far as it could in drier air 22 .",

This finding agrees with a few previous studies on coronavirus 23 and COVID-19 24, 25 , but disagrees with most studies claiming temperature has a decreasing 26, 27 , increasing 22 or no effect 28 on the transmissibility. However, we note that the sample size, with only 747 samples, is relatively small when restricting tempeture to high (T\u226525\u00b0). More data in the incoming season are needed to confirm the temperature effects because most regions in the globe have not experienced a COVID-19 pandemic with high temperature.",

Error! Reference source not found. shows the regional spared infectees through SA restrictions in half-month intevals. Only China Mainland, Taiwan, South Korea, and Australia show a diminshed trend, as a result of early restrictions of SA, whereas the Europe and the US continue to see large number of spared infectees growing exponentially by the end of this analysis.

The effectivness of the MOC in Australia might be explained by the adoption of additional control measures including mandatory quarantine of overseas arrivals and travel bans outside of Australia, and the relative small number of infectors in the beginning of the outbreak 29 . Although China was hit much harder in the begining, it survived the stress by imposing more strict control policies including the lockdown of the Hubei province, large-scale demobilization and mandatory quarantine of returning migrants (domestic) workers 29 , and by promptly increasing medical facilities including temporary hospitals 30 and reinforced medical crews from other provinces to the outbreak center 31 . The MOC of Europe, US, and arctic countries starts from a high value and decreases rapidly, but has not reached a low value at the end of our analyses (above or close to zero), indicating that their medical facility capacity and control polices (other than restricting SA) is evolving rapidly while still under stress of the large number of infectees accumlated during an earlier phase of the outbreak. The MOC of Africa and Latin America, though started with a low number, does not decrease as rapidly as the rest of the world.",

First, R0 , the reproductive number, is estimated from confirmed infectee records which can be inaccurate due to the lack of tested cases especially in the beginning of the outbreak and in regions with less testing capacity. Without globally distributed epidemic parameters of COVID-19 other than the confirmed cases, the adopted statistical estimation seems to be the only practical global solution (Method). Second, although the weather impacts are significant and are within expectation, the contribution of temperature, is subjected to revisitation after more countries experience the warmer weather. Finally, because the MOC is not parameterized but merely quantified, we cannot project MOC into the future. Therefore, our result should only be used to assess the contribution of each predictor, especially the restriction of socioeconomic activities, instead of predicting the total number of infectees in the future climate, or the end of the COVID-19 pandemic.
