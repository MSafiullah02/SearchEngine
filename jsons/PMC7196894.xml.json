Also, it is not a constant, but depends on\nvarious factors, such as age, for example.

The\nmeasures taken in Belgium aim to lower the reproduction number so that the health\nsystem can appropriately deal with COVID-19 patients. It is not merely numbers but\nalso the severity of cases, even when non-fatal. Because of an epidemic\u2019s initial\nexponential growth, even when it is off to a slow start, it is unfortunately true\nthat small causes, such as lockdown parties, can have severe consequences. In\naddition, the measures will have the required effect if the population is truly\nclosed, or part of a larger population with exactly the same population dynamics.\nBoundary effects, such as transnational contacts (e.g. between Norway and Sweden)\ncan fatally undermine the mitigation strategy. Further, the earlier that contact\nrates are drastically reduced (severe social distancing), the better. The closer we\ncome to cutting off the virus\u2019s transmission mode, the sooner we will change, and\nhence flatten, the curve.",
