The epicenter of pandemic was Wuhan in China and by this time the infection has involved nearly all the countries, affecting high-income as well as the low-income countries. Though it is transmitted mainly by droplets, secondary infection rates are high. Currently, about 20% of those infected have significant problems and need hospitalization and 5% of total infected may develop acute severe respiratory illness, and need intensive care including mechanical ventilation; the latter group has high case fatality, especially among elderly and those with comorbidities [1, 2] . In the absence of proven effective antiviral drugs, all patients need symptomatic and supportive treatment. Acute respiratory distress syndrome needs aggressive ventilatory support and also multiple organ support. Patients may need intensive care for weeks. Intensive care beds are limited and even developed countries are facing with shortage of ICU beds in view of sudden surge in the numbers of infected cases. Most patients with severe disease need ventilatory support for few weeks and there is shortage of ventilators. Health care personnel (HCP) have been reported to have high infection rate; in the absence of specific antiviral therapy and potential for more severe disease in HCP (possibly due to high inoculum of infection/ multiple exposures) [3] , adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) is necessary for all HCP to prevent infection in them. Most countries are facing major shortage of PPEs [4] .",

For example, in India, even if we consider 0.1% of population gets infected over next 60 d, and 5% of those infected need critical care, we need ICU beds for 65,000 people. An average duration of mechanical ventilation of 15 d, which translates into approximately 975,000 ventilator days. If this surge in epidemic is spread over 60 d, we need approximately 16,200 ventilators on a given day [total infection 1,300,000, hospitalization (20%) 260,000, ICU 65000]. While this is a simplistic calculation which assumes 0.1% infection rate, with higher infection rate of 1%, the numbers of ventilators required will be approximately 162,000. As of now India does not have that capacity [5] . Similarly, the capacity for intensive care in the country, including that in public health system is limited. While ventilators may still be sourced/ purchased, the necessary staffing will still be a major limiting factor. Therefore, it is clear that even if we prepare ourselves for the disaster there will be wide gap in demand and availability. In such a situation, facilities may not be in a position to provide appropriate medical care to all those in need, particularly if we have a massive outbreak similar to other countries such as Italy, Spain, Iran and United States.",

If same facility is used for both the groups, there will be chance of infection getting disseminated through patients and their attendants visiting the hospital [6] . This strategy is heavily dependent on accurate testing with a short turn-around time. We need relatively well equipped hospitals for acute care, which can be converted to COVID hospitals. The COVID hospitals will have a higher proportion of bed strength allocated to ICU and high dependency units. There will be a need for various equipments such as ventilators, multi-parameter monitors, pulse oximeters, non-invasive ventilators, infusion pumps, etc. as well need for adequate supply of oxygen, preferably a high pressure oxygen source. While there may be a shortfall in equipment, having adequate oxygen supplies is also likely to be an important challenge. It's also a challenge to procure suitable, appropriate quality consumables and accessories in adequate quantities. It may be worthwhile enhancing the care of moderately ill patients before scaling up the ICU beds where the expertise to run ICUs is limited.",

There could be platforms developed to facilitate evaluation and management of mildly symptomatic patients. This round the clock service should have options for a video consultation, and follow up. This will prevent a large number of visits by patients and their attendants to the hospital [7] . Limited experience in children suggests that COVID-19 infection is less common and less severe. Therefore, a child with severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) is less likely to have COVID as an etiology; so, these children (awaiting results of infection) should preferably be kept in separate isolation to reduce exposure from adult patients. It is suggested that approximately 5% of ICU beds be earmarked for children and about 10% in HDU/ wards. Additionally, adequate arrangements will be required for an attendant (parent/ relative) to stay with the child and also adequate PPE for the attendant should be provided.",

The authorities must make all possible efforts to make high quality PPE available for the HCPs; this should be the highest priority area. Conventionally, for best results, all PPEs should be properly disposed off after single use. In view of wide gap between demand and supply, some innovations and possible reuse of PPEs is required.
