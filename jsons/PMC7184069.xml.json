While rapid structural responses such as curfews, physical distancing protocols, and travel restrictions have greatly curtailed the spread of COVID-19 and effectively saved lives [1], we are also witnessing the alarming emergence of policies that enact and perpetuate violence against transgender communities. Panama, Peru, and Colombia (though only in Bogota) have legislated policies to enforce physical distancing by restricting the mobility of its citizens based on binary understandings of gender and associated norms [2, 3]. Meaning that on alternating days women are allowed to access essential services and on the other days, men. What about people and communities that exist outside of hegemonic understandings of binary gender presentation and identities? As has become clear these policies are not solely logistically problematic for transgender communities to negotiate. The implementation and policing of these binary, gender-based laws have also resulted in direct violence perpetrated against transgender communities [4].",

Namely, that this law reinforces the gender-binary and places transgender people in a grey zone of when they are legally allowed to access needed services such as food and medical supplies. Confusion over when trans people are allowed to access essential services further exposes them to violence through policing carried out by law enforcement and civil society more broadly. While surveillance of this law is based on physical appearance, citizens are required to show their national identity document if stopped by the police. Physical expressions of gender identity vary and access to gender affirming procedures and resources are deeply impacted by cost. Further, in the absence of a gender identity law, gender congruent identity documents require many arduous and expensive processes. Gender congruent IDs, thus, are inaccessible for the majority of Peruvian transgender women.",

While President Vizcarra should be commended for trying to implement stigma-reduction protocols and publicly denounced discrimination that surged from this gender-based population control strategy, in practice, his statement was simply not enough. Within the first two days following the implementation of gender restrictions, the Observatory of LGBTQ Human Rights at the Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia documented eleven cases of violence and related suffering experienced by gender non-binary people directly related to this law. Ultimately, the enactment of this policy intervention has reified ID documents as both a structural determinant of health for transgender people and a fundamental human right.",
