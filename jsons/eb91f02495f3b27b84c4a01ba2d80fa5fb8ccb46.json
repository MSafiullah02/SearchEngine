Fundamental to the design of rapid state reactions is the ability to perform epidemiological model parameter inference for localised trajectory predictions. In this work, we perform Bayesian parameter inference using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods on the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) and Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) epidemiological models with time-varying spreading rates for South Africa. The results find two change points in the spreading rate of COVID-19 in South Africa as inferred from the confirmed cases. The first change point coincides with state enactment of a travel ban and the resultant containment of imported infections. The second change point coincides with the start of a state-led mass screening and testing programme which has highlighted community-level disease spread that was not well represented in the initial largely traveller based and private laboratory dominated testing data. The results further suggest that due to the likely effect of the national lockdown, community level transmissions are slower than the original imported case driven spread of the disease.",

In the case of epidemiological model parameters, priors incorporate literature based expected values of parameters such as recovery rate(\u00b5), spreading rate(\u03bb), change points based on policy interventions etc. The prior settings for the model parameters are listed in table 1. We follow [4] by selecting LogNormal distributions for \u03bb and \u03c3 such that the initial mean basic reproductive number is 3.2 which is consistent with literature [1, 3, 4, 9, 11] . We set a LogNormal prior for the \u03c3 such that the mean incubation period is five days. We use the history of government interventions to set priors on change points in the spreading rate. The priors on change-points include 19/03/2020 when a travel ban and school closures were announced, and 28/03/2020 when a national lockdown was enforced. We assume apriori that each intervention reduces the mean spread rates from the Lognormal distributions. Similar to [4] we adopt \"weakly-informative\" Half-Cauchy priors for the initial conditions for the infected and exposed populations. .",

Results SIR and SEIR model parameter inference was performed using confirmed cases data upto and including 20 April 2020 and MCMC samplers described in the methodology section. Each of the samplers are run such that 2000 samples are drawn with 500 burn-in and tuning steps. We use leave-one-out(LOO) cross-validation error of [17] to evaluate the goodness of fit of each model and inference method pair. Table 2 shows the LOO validation errors of the various models. It can be seen that the SIR model with two change points inferred by Slice Sampling displays the best model fit with the lowest mean LOO of 446.77. The SEIR model with two change points inferred using the NUTS showed a mean LOO of 454.06. We note that [4] similarly finds that the SIR model displayed superior goodness of fit to the SEIR on German data.",

A mean recovery rate \u00b5 \u2248 0.136 implies mean infectious period of 7.36 days which is in line with related literature [1, 4, 9] . The inference of parameters is dependent on the underlying testing processes that generate the confirmed case data. The effect of the mass screening and testing campaign was to change the underlying confirmed case data generating process by widening the criteria of those eligible for testing. While initial testing focused on individuals that either had exposure to known cases or travelled to known COVID-19 affected countries, mass screening and testing further introduced detection of community level transmissions which may contain undocumented contact and exposure to COVID-19 positive individuals.",

The resulting parameter estimates fall in-line with the existing literature in-terms of mean baseline R 0 (before government action), mean incubation time and mean infectious period [1, 3, 4, 9] . We find that initial government action that mainly included a travel ban, school closures and stay-home orders resulted in a mean decline of 80% in the spreading rate. Further government action through mass screening and testing campaigns resulted in a second trajectory change point. This latter change point is mainly driven by the widening of the population eligible for testing, from travellers (and their known contacts) to include the generalised community who would have probably not afforded private lab testing which dominated the initial data. This resulted in an increase of R 0 to 1.301. The effect of mass screening and testing can also be seen in figure 9 indicating a mean increase in daily tests preformed from 1639 to 4374.",
