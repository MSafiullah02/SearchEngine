            "text": "An influenza pandemic has the potential to cause high hospital staff absenteeism and consequently disrupt hospital medical services at a time when they are needed most. We recommend thorough compulsory staff education on the effectiveness of basic infection control procedures and PPE in preventing transmission of the influenza virus, as well as accurate education on the actual risk posed by the influenza virus or other respiratory pathogens. This would potentially minimize staff absenteeism and thereby limit disruption to hospital services in the event of an Australian influenza pandemic threat.",
