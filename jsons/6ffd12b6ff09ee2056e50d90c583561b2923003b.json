Santos Jr., PhD 2 Victor Santana Santos, PhD 3 There is growing evidence that prenatal infection and enhanced expression of cytokines are associated with an increased risk of autism spectrum disorder J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f (ASD) and schizophrenia (SZ) in the offspring. Maternal immune activation appears to act as a \"neurodevelopmental disease primer\" increasing the susceptibility of individuals to the epigenetic alterations and environmental exposures that can interact in triggering disease-related symptoms later in life [4] . IL-6 has been treated as an indicator of maternal systemic inflammation with potential to influence placental-fetal interactions and subsequently fetal brain development and increased risk of offspring psychiatric disorders.",

In addition, it has been found that maternal IL-6 is inversely associated with offspring cognition at 12-months age, which strengthen the assumption that maternal inflammation may constitute an intrauterine condition of particular importance in the context of potentially neuropsychiatric disorders [6] . Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that cytokine storm and hyperinflammation found in pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection may increase the risk for neurodevelopmental disorders in the neonates. Urgent research agenda should include assessment of inflammatory levels in pregnant women with COVID-19 and longitudinal evaluation of offspring neurodevelopmental outcomes.",

            "text": "as COVID-19. This emerging coronavirus is closely related genetically to the SARS-CoV-1 and uses the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) as host cell receptors. The binding between SARS-CoV-2 and these cell receptors leads to hyper-activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway and increased production of inflammatory cytokines including IL-6 and TNF\u03b1, which are implicated in the severe lung injury and poor clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19[1].Although much attention has been placed on older adults populations for being a high-risk group susceptible to life-threatening respiratory and systemic conditions associated to SARS-CoV-2 infection, pregnant women should not be disregarded as high-risk population and should be considered in policies and public health strategies focusing on prevention and management of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Findings from a recent systematic review suggest lack of evidence for vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2[2], however studies evaluating the effects of inflammation dysregulation in pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2, the effects on the pathophysiology and genomic function of the placenta and the potential short-and long-term effects on children developmental outcomes are yet to be fully explored. On April 11, 2020, a study showed that pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection had higher levels of IL-6 compared to nonpregnant women which may important implications in the development of fetuses[3].",
