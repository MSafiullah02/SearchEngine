            "text": "When we first began drafting this article, we wanted to raise our collective dissatisfaction that live debate in universities has all but disappeared. Each of the authors of this paper has presented at and chaired a series of Midlands HE Policy Network (MHEPN) debates that we recently developed and hosted through the Education Observatory, University of Wolverhampton. Each author also participated in the Higher Education Institutional Research (HEIR) Conference, held at the University of Wolverhampton in September 2019, with the theme of \u2018measuring excellence\u2019 in Higher Education. The MHEPN debates were intended as a powerful, place-based forum to hear regional voices that seem to be virtually silenced by the generic structure of national policy frameworks focused on \u2018measuring excellence\u2019. Now, as we publish our thoughts on the necessity for live face-to-face debate from regional universities unprecedented measures to resist the spread of Covid-19 mean that \u2018virtual\u2019 is literally all that we have left. Whilst the arguments that we share about audible, place-based debate remain highly relevant, a further layer of complexity now unfolds before us. The biological work of this pandemic intermingles with technological communications and social activities to materially and emotionally alter each of our lives.",

            "text": "At this point in time then, when the global economy and heathcare worldwide reel from the pressures of Covid-19, we are moving even more rapidly away from face-to-face meetings by necessity. Yet simultaneously, this crisis reveals the crucial role that local communities play in any national or global efforts to fight a spiralling pandemic. Now is therefore an important time to \u2018voice\u2019 the essential part that regional universities play in connecting global technological and biological change, with local social projects, citizens and industry. Postdigital theory (Jandri\u0107 et al. 2018) offers one, not entirely perfect, but with room for discussion route, towards understanding also that Covid-19 does not sit apart from other global and local challenges, such as developing creative skills across populations to contend with automation, change, unemployment and opportunity in a 4th Industrial Revolution (4IR) (Peters et al. 2019). People\u2019s lives are now fusions of both analogue and digital technologies and social practices (Jandri\u0107 et al. 2018). Such interconnections can be noticed all around. For example, even as airlines are grounded worldwide, in an unplanned global detox for our atmosphere, we are purchasing (stockpiling perhaps\u2026 and even making by hand\u2026) more plastic bottles of hand sanitiser than ever before. As fast as we seek to communicate crucial information virtually, we also need to be aware of those who may use little or no technology, or who simply cannot afford to. Whilst contactless forms of payment and automated checkouts are prioritised, at the same time, human forms of social care have never been in more demand. Thus, health, social welfare and sustainability concerns are visibly mingling before our eyes, with economic and technological ones. This is a situation that concerns universities at many levels, and not least because it crosses disciplinary boundaries. It is these messy postdigital connections (where many, but not all people, lead lives that are now simultaneously offline and online, material and virtual) that are omitted from national excellence frameworks, alongside deeply contextual differences between our regional universities.",

            "text": "With this in mind, we will firstly discuss the problems of attempting to capture the rich work of academia through generic, static, national frameworks that are set for regional universities, not developed by them. This is akin to beginning research (rather unethically) by stating what the findings will be before actually approaching the participants. Instead, adopting a grounded, bottom-up approach, using a variety of methods, can make audible the regional voices expressing what is really being done by universities, avoiding assumptions and dynamically informing policy. Perhaps then, at the start of a new (and now very uncertain) decade, it is time to take the triple excellence frameworks of REF (Research Excellence Framework), TEF (Teaching Excellence and Student Outcomes Framework) and an emerging KEF (Knowledge Exchange Framework) as more of a departure point, rather than a fixed agenda. Even as we write, the deadline for REF has been suspended, buying us all time to reflect on immediate and fundamental change amid a pandemic. Perhaps this is also a good time to thank these exercises for their contribution in revealing the many issues of a national, largely quantitative, rational interpretation of excellence set for universities. After that we might proceed with a richer, more regionally aware agenda, for excellent practices set by universities, one that really reflects, and responds to, contextual and locational diversity:",

            "text": "Therefore, secondly, we point to a rather ironic contrast between our national political system and our universities. Active debate takes place daily in the UK Parliament, yet through HE legislation and policy delivering generic excellence frameworks, such measuring effectively shuts down these forms of exchanges within regional, educational institutions. Whilst much attention is focused towards diversity and inclusivity at a national policy level, there seems to be considerably less attention placed on how this plays out differently between institutions and locations. Universities are immersed in different regional contexts, local economies and historical backgrounds. They are interlinked with the communities, schools, industry, local dialects, culture, demographics, deprivation and affluence of the places that surround them. Competing simply to occupy a similar national space risks silencing these diverse voices, and overlooking varying needs, talents and opportunities in each region. Even as we write, we note that (amid the escalating Covid-19 pandemic) the UK government is committing to distributing research-related funding more fairly across the UK (Pells and Inge 2020). Yet in the days since the budget announcement by Chancellor Rishi Sunak of his \u2018plan to invest in R&D and cutting-edge technologies\u2019 to provide \u2018support for people in every nation and region of the UK to gain the skills they will need as the economy evolves\u2019, the government\u2019s pledge \u2018to level up opportunity and share prosperity across the UK\u2019 is also being questioned (Pells and Inge 2020). Graeme Reid, Chair of Science and Research Policy at University College London, has expressed concern at always being told \u2018the cheque is in the post,\u2019 and bafflement that, \u2018in a budget that has got some very interesting and clearly well-thought-through content about the place agenda, they\u2019ve managed to display no progress whatsoever on the Shared Prosperity Fund\u2019 (Pells and Inge 2020). As announcements unfold, a postdigital perspective recognises that whilst scientific and medical knowledge will understandably be key, all steps that are taken will also concern human-technological-material-social-global-regional aspects, as advice is enacted across populations and into the future.",

            "text": "We therefore thirdly each explain (in our own voices) why we believe there is a need for audible place-based debate in HE institutions, via initiatives like our Midlands HE Policy Network (MHEPN). We provide our insights too into why a balance of data, evidence, dialogue, and expertise drawn from our regions is needed, together with suitable investment, to move beyond empty national \u2018excellence\u2019 frameworks alone. This has implications for universities, communities, individuals, and policymakers. Live oppositional argument is just one way dynamically to raise voices from regional univerisites, which are otherwise suppressed by data-driven, nationally focused, measures of excellence. Whilst it is not unusual for media companies to broadcast political debates such as Question Time (BBC 2020) from regional locations, our concern is that such live events appear now to be starkly absent from our educational institutions, where once they thrived. This is not easily changed under current circumstances, when a national lockdown has altered for now the ways in which people live. However, these are key principles that can still be upheld across online technologies and indeed in this article itself. Though our voices are not \u2018live\u2019, or being heard by a group of participants meeting in the same room, they still argue, as they would in that regional context. After each dialogue has been presented, we discuss the role of collective writing about debate\u2026to further debate! Lastly, and certainly not least, we invite others to come forward to host such events as MHERN in the future, (once it is safe to do so), but also to contribute their ideas and voices to extend the experimental format we have developed over the last year. Though it may not currently be safe to crowd into the same room to share the noisy, friendly arguments we have enjoyed during the last year in debate, we can still gather our opinions together, in the act of collective writing.",

This leaves HE institutions simply repeating dominant patterns of rationalisation in wider society, like those noted by George Ritzer in his McDonaldisation thesis, and that are now also replicated and augmented online (Ritzer et al. 2018).

This plays down not only the crucial part that universities need to play as sites of connectivity for \u2018linking the requirements of industry, technology and market forces with the demands of citizenship\u2019 (Delanty 2001), it also effectively removes an authenticity of place and region (Jopling and Johnson 2019). Yet it is precisely this civic focus \u2018that might just help to rebuild trust in universities as well as restoring local growth and tackling deep regional inequality\u2019 (Westwood 2019). These are key concerns as the realities of under-investment in regions, as well as nationally focused assumptions are revealed in the responses to Covid-19 and a 4th Industrial Revolution (Connor et al. 2019). Now is not the time for policy or media rhetoric to drown out diverse regional voices that express a sense of personal investment and belonging, which leads to both the civic engagement and the creative enterprise we need to draw upon in wider society. Nor should we further a dangerous culture, where education is developed towards therapy, rather than to further autonomous thinking (Ecclestone and Hayes 2019).",

(2020) point out that many practices are not adequately captured in data that relies on teachers\u2019 and students\u2019 activities conforming to an anticipated model. They suggest instead that a balance of data, evidence, dialogue, and expertise is necessary. Furthermore, within their \u2018ecological\u2019 view of HE institutions, rather than considering the performance of individuals in isolation, evaluation can also look at policies, systems and environments, and how these support and constrain educational practice (Goodyear and Carvalho 2019; Fawns et al. 2020; S. Hayes 2019a). As such, they call for analytics that are part of a wider, ecological view of education, where relationships and holistic conceptions of practice are valued above individual variables (Goodyear and Carvalho 2019), and where it is acknowledged that metrics do not capture everything that is important (Fawns et al. 2020). It is here that we suggest that audible regional debate has an integral part to play. Fawns et al. (2020) emphasise the importance of dialogues between teachers and students to make sense of how the formal curriculum intertwines with informal, extra-curricular activity and emergent sites of learning. They suggest that in engaging in dialogue (through workshops, interviews, and other events) with stakeholders, including teaching and administrative staff, students, and the wider community, a values-led vision for universities can be furthered (Fawns et al. 2020).",

But when and where do these public debates take place? Not, it would seem, in the modern, marketized university. In comparing university education and public training, Stefan Collini (2017: 235) makes the important distinction that \u2018education relativizes and constantly calls into question the information which training simply transmits\u2019. It is precisely this calling into question that we thought this network could encourage through discussion, provocation and debate.

It is striking that even advocates for fairly radical forms of regionalism (e.g. Niven 2019) tend to fall into old, oppositional geographical patterns, even whilst ingeniously co-opting the South West into the North. We associated MHEPN with the \u2018Midlands\u2019 because it is simultaneously a useful regional marker (although with very open borders) and an ambiguous one. The Midlands represents both somewhere, drawing on a history of debate, challenge, and calling into question, and nowhere. As a between space below the North and above the South, the Midlands resembles the modern university, caught between oppositions such as excellence and enquiry, learning and delivery, student and customer. This does not mean it is the only space in which to debate these kinds of issues, but it does seem to make it a valuable one.",

Collini suggests that the language we use when discussing the university plays its part in how we understand and situate it and also how we live in relation to it (Collini 2017: 35). As regional institutions, where a rich array of voices express what is actually being done by universities, we have a much stronger chance, if connections can be made with wider policy. In order to develop this dialogue, we need to move away from an approach to writing policy that effectively writes out the labour of students, teachers and leaders (S Hayes 2019a). It is their place-based innovations, creativity and diverse voices that contribute towards reducing regional inequalities and developing skills. It is here in the varied regions of the UK that universities are crucial sites too, for connecting global technological change with local social projects and citizens. In a \u2018new political economy of higher education\u2019, it is a problem if research simply remains \u2018policy-orientated, descriptive and under-theorised\u2019 (Schulze-Cleven et al. 2017). Debate across regional institutions therefore provides a vehicle to connect new modes of inquiry and to surface academic perspectives on personal positionality, in \u2018the new postdigital political economy of HE\u2019 (S.

Postdigital positionality is just one way to interpret our individual contexts and to appreciate that people\u2019s lives are now fusions of analogue and digital technologies and social practices (Jandri\u0107 et al. 2018).

Right now, all eyes are understandably on the Conservative Government\u2019s responses to the Covid-19 crisis, but this pandemic does not sit apart from other political economic challenges in HE, and beyond. Whilst political and economic measures to enact Brexit continue, a biological epidemic has travelled throughout Europe and across the globe, simultaneously grinding human travel to a halt. Over a matter of days, our global lives have returned to local lives, by necessity. As we try to grapple with overwhelming implications, postdigital insights can further our thinking and responses. Covid-19 has wrought tragedy on a huge scale, but even amid social isolation, we can make collective, productive observations as we look to the future. The current health crisis has all but closed universities, but these regional institutions are feeding into the collective effort to both research Covid-19 tests and vaccines and to manufacture lifesaving equipment. Across the underperforming regions surrounding many of these universities, low-paid care assistants and supermarket workers are being relied upon, as much as professors and doctors. Predicted automation linked to 4IR has therefore not simply replaced human cashiers and shelf stockers, as anticipated in simple terms, because technological change is interconnected with all other forms of change. There is nothing new in this situation of course. After the Black Death in the fourteenth century, unskilled labour was at a premium. In England at least, this was pivotal in destroying serfdom as it had existed for hundreds of years. Thus, our current circumstances, alongside rapid technological changes, are worthy of continuous debate as we consider how \u2018levelling up\u2019 economic performance and closing gaps between regions might be achieved going forward. As regions unite to tackle the crisis, government thinking on HE and the economy needs to recognise the \u2018anchor institutions\u2019 (Skidmore 2020) in overlooked communities, to support their research and to aid their graduates who stay and work in these regions. In each of these places, spaces for live academic dialogue need to gain momentum to rethink what HE can now achieve.",

The imposed rationalities of national and context-free frameworks for excellence only serve to negate personal and institutional positionalities, in our postdigital contexts as they stand. This risks closing down critical, locational dialogue that yields creative and innovative solutions to both current, and future, crises. Couldry (2010) has argued, \u2018voice matters\u2019. Our HE policy texts are currently devoid of the regional and contextual voices that matter. This needs to change if the many statements about inclusivity and diversity we read in national and institutional policies are to be upheld. The MHEPN has experimented with one way to restore live, audible, human argument in response. This yielded a powerful response from our colleagues requesting more of these forums. Given that universities are crucial sites to connect global, technological change with local social projects and citizens, we owe it to each other to debate what it really means for humans to re-occupy policy, now and in the future (S. Hayes 2019a). A postdigital perspective recognises all of the aspects that we have brought together above, as intertwined dialectically with each other across time and space. In a further layer of complexity, the biological work of a pandemic has connected with technological communications and social activities to materially and emotionally alter the lives of most people on the planet. This too has raised some voices, suppressed others and restricted global freedom of mobility, requiring people to remain (for now) in their local places.",

This is a debate that can be furthered by regional universities who can serve as a conduit to connect local community with wider policy contexts. We have argued that attempting to capture the rich work of academia across the UK\u2019s regions through generic, static, national excellence frameworks set for regional universities, but not developed by them, is fraught with problems. We suggested this regulatory approach is akin to beginning a research project and unethically predicting what the findings will be, even before approaching the participants. Therefore, new policy frameworks that recognise the voices from regional universities, as well as their complex postdigital contexts, are needed. With the core of this article focused on the role of live, place-based debate to surface the real contributions of universities in their communities and to link these with national policy, we have used collective writing as an alternative way to raise each of our academic voices on this topic, amid a pandemic.",

Whilst we scarcely dare to imagine a future scenario where such a pandemic might actually be repeated, we need to go further now, and actually voice this concern. In countries across the globe, national leaders seek solutions that rely on the commitment and creativity of people from across the local regions. It is time to recognise universities as postdigital sites, for connecting global technological and biological change, with local, social projects and citizens. We discussed the irony of a loss of debate within regional universities, when in UK Parliament, debate remains a key forum through which the current measures to protect the public from a pandemic are being brought into policy.

Raising regional academic voices reflects both a reassertion of old values\u2014as in Dennis Hayes\u2019 celebration of debate, as a skill to be learned\u2014and a reassertion of emergent forms, as in the post-digital exploration of collective ways of learning together, captured in the central narrative. What the four authors share in common is a clarity about the things of value omitted in the dominant neoliberal paradigm that has shaped so much of our public lives over the last thirty or forty years. If the initial, modest steps to allocate scarce resources for major science investment, which inspired the first Research Assessment Exercise worked (at least for big science), the subsequent explosion of centrally determined data captures, and the emergence of league tables\u2014and their attendant homogenisation of higher education, has had the perhaps understandable effect of corroding academic collegiality. It has done this in too many places through a top-down managerialist culture, as institutional leaders, trapped in a fiscal fight, if not quite to the death, struggle to respond to external demands that risk distorting institutional missions. All of this has taken place in the name of marketization. The cost of these ways of thinking to institutions\u2019 responsibility to locality was, for me, graphically highlighted as Nottingham University decimated its regional adult learning programmes whilst opening a new shiny campus in Ningbo, China (Tuckett 2017).",

The paper emerges from the debates generated in the Midlands Higher Education Policy Network, and is properly alive to the bleaching out of regional responsiveness from the drivers shaping current higher education. Yet, whilst it is properly on the side of devolution rather than a one size fits all centralised higher education discourse, and whilst it celebrates the diversity and difference in a co-operative dialogue, it stays comfortably within the sectoral boundaries of higher education. What, I wondered as I read it, would be different in a wider discussion of the sort that the Cape Learning Region in South Africa engaged in, as educators struggled to explore the distinctiveness of different institutional forms, whilst working to create a wider learning culture. Those ideas have fired the resurgence, globally of interest in Learning Cities and Learning Regions, amongst them the Wolverhampton Learning City Region. There, inevitably, educators recognise that in reconfiguring a learning culture, academics need allies in business, industry, the faith and voluntary sector, and need, too, to imagine new forms of association, involving adults and young people of all sorts. That, surely, is the humus that will be needed if a politics linking productivity, skills, and a learning culture are to be revitalised.",

We are all not post-digital but co-digital, whether we like it or not. All of us, at every level (personal, institutional, national), have our own accommodations to the digital age. Simultaneously, we live with the digital, conduct ourselves alongside the digital, try to outlaw the digital, embrace the digital, hide from the digital, spy on the digital, and court the digital.
