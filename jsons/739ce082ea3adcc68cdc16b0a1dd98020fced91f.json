In the tissues, they undergo apoptosis unless survival factors (mostly IL-5) are present. The eosinophil contains two types of intracytoplasmic granules, the content of which can be released by degranulation, while other mediators are secreted (with involvement of vesicle-associated membrane proteins in the regulation of granule fusion within the cell). The larger granules, identifi ed by a dense crystalloid matrix at electron microscopy, contain the characteristic cationic proteins major basic protein (MBP), eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), eosinophilderived neurotoxin (EDN), and the enzymatic protein eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) [ 1 , 2 ] . The smaller amorphous granules contain arylsulfatase and acid phosphatase. The process of degranulation by activated eosinophil releases cationic proteins into the extracellular space, with potential direct toxicity to the heart, brain, and bronchial epithelium. Degranulated eosinophils can be identifi ed at electron microscopy by presence of cytoplasmic vacuoles, and loss of electron density of the central core of the granules (inversion or disappearance of core density). Molecular and intracellular pathways regulating eosinophil differentiation, priming, activation, degranulation, and mediator secretion, and how the release of toxic substances contributes to the pathophysiology of eosinophilic disorders, have become better understood on a molecular standpoint and are reviewed elsewhere [ 2 ] . In addition to cationic proteins, eosinophils release proinfl ammatory cytokines, lipid-and arachidonic acid-derived mediators, enzymes, reactive oxygen species, and matrix metalloproteases, all of which may contribute to the pathophysiology of eosinophilic lung diseases.",

Intercellular signaling is mediated by surface expression of adhesion molecules, apoptotic signaling molecules, chemokines, complement receptors, chemotactic factor receptors, cytokine receptors, and immunoglobulin receptors. For instance, eosinophils are capable of regulating mast cell function and histamine release. Eosinophils have further immune properties. They express the major histocompatibility complex II protein human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR, can present the antigen to T-helper lymphocytes, and secrete an array of cytokines, thereby promoting effector T-cell proliferation. They can synthetise IL-4 and promote IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 secretion by CD4 + T cells (promoting Th2 lymphocyte activation), and secrete indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (indirectly promoting Th1 apoptosis), modulating the Th1/Th2 balance. Abnormalities in the T-cell receptor repertoire and T-cell clonotype of BAL lymphocytes and peripheral blood lymphocytes seem to contribute to the pathophysiology of eosinophilic lung diseases [ 3 ] . Overall, the paradigm of eosinophil function has changed from a terminal effector cell in allergic airway diseases to their being involved in the initial stages of pathophysiology.",

As the recruitment of eosinophils to the lung mostly implicates IL-5 and the eotaxin subfamily of chemokines (itself regulated by the Th2 cell-derived IL-13 cytokine), those are the target of several drugs in development, which can potentially change dramatically the therapeutic landscape of eosinophilic disorders in the near future [ 4 ] . Other promising targets for therapy include the IL-5 receptor, CD2 binding protein, IgE, and IL-4/IL-13 receptor, with a few agents already at the stage of clinical evaluation. Although histopathologic lesions in eosinophilic pneumonias are largely reversible, tissue damage can occur especially in allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), and in eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) (Churg-Strauss syndrome, CSS), with possible remodeling and fi brosis in the bronchial mucosa. It is unknown yet whether anti-IL-5 antibodies and other therapeutic agents that target eosinophilspecifi c molecules, may prevent tissue damage. In addition, newer drugs specifi cally targeting cytokines of the eosinophil lineage contribute to a better understanding of the pathogenic role of eosinophils [ 4 ] . therefore mandatory that the clinician take a full history and search thoroughly for a cause with potentially practical consequences, such as parasitic infection or drug or toxic exposure.",

Although they can show characteristic features of eosinophilic pneumonia, transbronchial lung biopsies are generally not recommended due to the small size of the specimen that allows only partial morphologic evaluation. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is now considered a good surrogate of lung biopsy to demonstrate lung eosinophilia, although no study has defi nitely established a correlation between increased eosinophils at differential cell count and eosinophilic pneumonia at lung pathology. In normal subjects, BAL eosinophilia is lower than 1 % of cells at differential count. In contrast, BAL eosinophilia greater than 40 % is found mainly in patients with chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, whereas BAL eosinophilia between 3 and 40 % (and especially between 3 and 9 %) may be found in various interstitial lung diseases other than eosinophilic pneumonia. A conservative cutoff of 40 % of eosinophils at BAL differential cell count has been adopted for the diagnosis of ICEP in clinical studies [ 12 , 13 ] , and a cutoff of 25 % has been proposed for the diagnosis of IAEP [ 14 ] . We recommend that a clinical diagnosis of eosinophilic pneumonia be supported by alveolar eosinophilia when the eosinophils (1) are the predominant cell population of BAL cell count (macrophages excepted) and (2) represent more than 25 % of differential cell count (with greater specifi city when greater than 40 %).",

It may be missing in patients who have already received systemic corticosteroids, and it is often absent at presentation in IAEP. Blood cell count must thus be done before starting corticosteroids. Blood eosinophilia is defi ned by an eosinophil blood count greater than 0.5 \u00d7 10 9 /L, and hypereosinophilia by an eosinophil blood count greater than 1.5 \u00d7 10 9 /L on two examinations at least 1 month interval, and/or tissue hypereosinophilia [ 15 ] . Blood eosinophilia greater than 1 \u00d7 10 9 /L (and preferably hypereosinophilia) may obviate the need to perform BAL in individual cases with typical presentation. For example, BAL may occasionally be omitted to confi rm L\u00f6ffl er's syndrome (as it occurs in ascariasis) in a patient with mild cough, wheezes, transient pulmonary opacities at chest radiograph, and frank blood eosinophilia. However BAL is generally useful to rule out alternative diagnoses (such as bacterial or parasitic pneumonia, or pulmonary infi ltrates related to Hodgkin disease), and BAL is recommended to confi rm the diagnosis of eosinophilic pneumonia in most cases.",

Interlobular septal thickening and bilateral pleural effusion seen in a majority of patients are highly suggestive of the diagnosis in the setting of eosinophilic pneumonia [ 14 , 18 , 27 , 30 , 33 ] (or in a patient spuriously suspected to have infectious pneumonia).",

Heart involvement mostly results from eosinophilic myocarditis, and rarely from arteritis of the larger coronary arteries [ 51 , 52 ] . Although marked improvement usually occurs with corticosteroid treatment, heart involvement in EGPA may require heart transplantation, with possible recurrence of eosinophilic vasculitis in the transplanted heart. A strict cardiac evaluation is therefore warranted in any patient with suspected EGPA, generally including electrocardiogram, echocardiography, serum level of troponin, and magnetic resonance imaging of the heart. Cardiac MRI frequently shows late enhancement of the myocardium [ 53 -55 ] , which may correspond to myocarditis, however the absence of a gold standard, it is diffi cult at a given point in time to differentiate irreversible scar lesions from active infl ammation requiring intense immunosuppression, and incidental fi ndings from clinically relevant myocardial involvement. Treatment decisions are eventually based on critical clinical evaluation, taking into account results from several investigations, including electrocardiogram, echocardiography, troponine level, and possibly a combination of cardiac MRI and positron emission tomography. In addition to myocardial involvement, asymptomatic pericarditis with limited effusion at echocardiography is common, with rare cases of tamponade, and the risk of venous thromboembolic events [ 56 ] is increased in patients with EGPA. Endomyocardial involvement (typically seen in idiopathic HES) is uncommon in EGPA.",

A possible mechanistic link has been proposed [ 71 ] . Since EGPA may follow montelukast treatment in asthmatic patients without smoldering EGPA, may recur on rechallenge with the drug, and may remit on its withdrawal [ 66 , 68 ] , a causal relationship cannot be excluded [ 70 ] , and we advocate that leukotriene receptor antagonists be avoided in patients with asthma, eosinophilia, and/or established or smoldering extrapulmonary manifestations.",

She had no history of allergic manifestations. Severity of asthma had increased over the past year, and montelukast had been prescribed 4 months ago by her general physician in addition to her long-term treatment with inhaled longacting corticosteroids and bronchodilators. On admission, she presented with acute exacerbation of asthma, nasal obstruction with nasal crusts, asthenia, arthralgia, palpable purpura of the lower extremities, and was further diagnosed with mononeuritis multiplex. The chest radiograph showed areas of ground glass opacity, with further patchy peripheral bilateral alveolar consolidation at chest CT. Peripheral blood eosinophils were 5.6 \u00d7 10 9 /L. Differential cell count of bronchoalveolar lavage demonstrated 65 % eosinophils, 4 % neutrophils, 7 % lymphocytes, and 24 % macrophages. Skin biopsy showed leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative. Electrocardiogram, echocardiography, and serum troponine level were normal. Pulmonary function tests showed airfl ow obstruction, with marginal improvement with inhaled bronchodilators. The patient was diagnosed with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis and was treated with oral prednisolone (1 mg/kg per day for 1 month then progressively tapered). Montelukast was discontinued. Complete remission was obtained. Three years later, the patient complains of chronic rhinosinusitis, dyspnea on exertion with nonreversible moderate airfl ow obstruction despite high-dose inhaled anti-asthmatic therapy and 5 mg/day of oral prednisolone. Peripheral blood eosinophils are in the normal range. There are no sequelae of systemic manifestations.",

Patients with ANCA have a vasculitic phenotype of disease with an increased frequency of extracapillary glomerular lesions, peripheral neuropathy, purpura, and biopsy-proven vasculitis.

As a treatment is often considered before irreversible systemic complications occur, the diagnosis of HES is now considered in patients with blood hypereosinophilia (greater than 1.5 \u00d7 10 9 /L) on at least two occasions in the absence of other etiologies for the eosinophilia, allowing earlier diagnosis and management.",

Lymphocyte phenotyping by fl ow cytometry to detect a phenotypically aberrant T-cell subset, and analysis of the rearrangement of the TCR genes in search of T-cell clonality on the peripheral blood (and possibly bone marrow), are therefore key to the diagnosis.

Notably, whitish tracheal and bronchial granulations or bronchial ulcerative lesions can be present with prominent eosinophilia at bronchial biopsy [ 98 ] .",

Bronchiectasis represent the ultimate consequence of damage to the large bronchi by chronic infl ammation. Mucoid impaction of high attenuation on CT represent mucous plugs containing Aspergillus obstructing the airways with subsequent atelectasis. Mosaic attenuation, centrilobular nodules, and tree-in-bud opacities are also commonly seen. The presence of bronchiectasis, centrilobular nodules, and mucoid impaction on CT scan are highly suggestive of ABPA in an asthmatic (Figs. 15.8 , 15.9 and 15.10 ) [ 123 ] . Agarwal et al. have suggested a classifi cation based on CT imaging pattern between serological ABPA (without bronchiectasis), ABPA with bronchiectasis, ABPA with high-attenuation mucus, and ABPA with pleuropulmonary fi brosis [ 108 ] .",

In addition, oral corticosteroids are used during acute exacerbations, with rapid tapering. Oral corticosteroids are maintained on the long-term only in patients with frequent symptomatic attacks or chronic symptoms, with the objective of preventing the progression to the fi brotic end stage, although with lowlevel evidence. In two double-blind, randomized, placebocontrolled studies [ 124 , 125 ] , oral itraconazole allowed reduction of the doses of corticosteroids, decrease in the number of exacerbations [ 125 ] , and improvement of biologic (sputum eosinophils, sputum ECP levels, serum IgE levels, and serum IgG levels to A. fumigatus ) and physiologic criteria, suggesting a clinical benefi t in approximatively 60 % of patients with ABPA [ 126 ] , especially those with corticosteroid-dependent ABPA; no signifi cant effect was observed on pulmonary infi ltrates [ 127 ] . Itraconazole is therefore recommended in ABPA in asthmatics [ 128 ] . It may also be useful in ABPA patients with cystic fi brosis [ 126 , 129 ] .

Monitoring total serum IgE level may be helpful, with an objective of reducing the serum total IgE level by \u226525 % with therapy [ 108 ] . Itraconazole interacts with many medications, with a risk of adrenal insuffi ciency; due to frequent drug interactions, the use of oral prednisone, and inhaled beclomethasone or ciclesonide, should be preferred to that of oral methylprednisolone and inhaled budesonide or fl uticasone [ 126 ] .",

In pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis, the pathologic lesions consist of nodules with a bronchiolocentric stellate shape composed of Langerhans cells with variable numbers of eosinophils, especially in the initial active stage and at the periphery of the lesions. Eosinophilic alveolitis in lung transplant recipients may be indicative of acute rejection (tissue eosinophilia is involved in rejection after renal, cardiac, hepatic, and pancreatic transplantation). BAL eosinophilia of 2 % or greater is associated with a poor outcome in lung transplantation [ 147 ] , or may result from infection.
