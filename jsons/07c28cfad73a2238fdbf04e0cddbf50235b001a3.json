But this time we are urging for 1 intensive care unit (ICU) beds, ventilators and personal protective equipment rather than 2 operating rooms (OR). Our ICU capacities have been doubled by transforming any available 3 space with ventilators into ICUs: recovery rooms, outpatient surgical unit, even ORs. As to spare 4 most of in-hospital resources, all non-emergent surgical procedures have been cancelled. ORs are 5 used to manage emergencies only. According to the French Society for Vascular Surgery's 6 recommendations based on the 3Ss principle (save Staff, Space and Stuff), our surgical activity is 7 now limited to the following emergencies: acute aortic syndromes, critical and acute limb 8 ischemia, symptomatic carotid stenosis, mesenteric ischemia and vascular access for 9 hemodialysis, with endovascular favored over open repair whenever possible to shorten hospital 10 and ICU stay. Regarding staff management, our daily rotations have been completely modified with one team 4 dedicated to vascular emergencies in each center. Remaining team members participate to 5",

To coordinate and optimize acute patient 13 referrals, we created secured social network groups including all vascular surgery consultants 14 from both public and private hospitals in Paris area. These groups allowed to share clinical 15 experience and set-up clinical studies. ICUs have been divided into Covid-19-positive and 16Covid-19-negative units. Therefore, systematic preoperative screening for Covid-19 should be 17 recommended. Suspected cases might be considered positive. No Covid-19-negative center could 18 have been preserved due to the magnitude of the pandemic. 19 Most importantly, we have observed a rising number of acute arterial events in Covid-19 patients 20 with no prior vascular history, as related by Zhang et al. 1 These vascular complications include 21 acute thrombosis of the abdominal aorta, carotid and peripheral arteries, and can be the revealing 22 symptom of Covid-19. The assumption of a Covid-19 related hypercoagulability is supported by 23 high reported rates of deep venous and pulmonary thromboembolism and the identification of a 1 disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in Covid-19 ICU patients. 2 Our group is 2 conducting a clinical study regarding vascular events in Covid-19 patients. 3",
