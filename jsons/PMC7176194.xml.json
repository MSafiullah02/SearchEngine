In other ILDs, BAL findings may support, in combination with clinical and high-resolution computer tomography (HRCT) findings, a suspected diagnosis or make it unlikely. This method is also a valid support for research. Genetic and molecular biomarkers, with different diagnostic/prognostic significance, can be detected in BAL.

It samples material from large airways as trachea and smaller airways down to the level of segmental or subsegmental bronchi for diagnostic purpose as bacteriological or tumor cytology studies. The amount of fluid instilled is comparatively small, around 20 mL. On the other hand, there are therapeutic purposes for lavage techniques too. Often amounts of some aliquots of 20 mL are needed to remove tenacious secretions under bronchoscopy in patients suffering from chronic bronchitis, asthma, or bronchiectasis. This is sometimes necessary and the most simple therapeutic lavage technique. The most invasive lavage technique is whole lung lavage, a therapeutic procedure for pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. It is performed under general anesthesia and double-lumen intubation. Repeated instillations of 1,000 mL are used up to 20 or more liters.",

From these lobes, about 20% more fluid and cells are recovered than from the lower lobes. Alternatively, one of the anterior segments or subsegments of the upper or lower lobes of both lungs may be used, if it is impossible or difficult to carry it out at the standard site. If diffuse lung disease is the indication for BAL, a good interlobar correlation was found concerning lavage cell differentials, lymphocyte subpopulations, and asbestos body counts. While a single-site BAL cellular profile is assumed to be representative of the lung as a whole in interstitial lung disease (ILD), some evidence suggests that this diagnostic procedure might be more useful if it was targeted to one of the pulmonary segments most affected, as identified by chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT). In patients with marked radiographic heterogeneity or with localized lesions, such as inflammatory infiltrates, malignant lesions, or from other cause, it is recommended that the area of greatest abnormality, as seen on the chest radiograph or CT, should be chosen as the preferred site for BAL. Some follow the concept of BAL at two or three different sites to reach higher representation.",

The most widespread technique is to instill the fluid directly through the biopsy channel of the fiber bronchoscope. Optimal recovery is accomplished by occluding the bronchial lumen with the bronchoscope. The tip of the bronchoscope is therefore advanced into a bronchial segment (or subsegment) until a wedge position is reached. Alternatively, a suction catheter through the working channel can be used. The catheter is placed more peripherally to subsegmental or subsubsegmental bronchi. Local anesthesia fluid should be removed prior to instillation of the lavage fluid, since it may influence cell viability. The fluid is instilled with syringes using a standard number of input aliquots. Commonly 20-mL syringes are used (alternatively 60-mL) and four to five aliquots are recommended up to a total volume of 100\u2013300 mL. Smaller instilled volumes carry the risk of contamination by the bronchial spaces. Then a more \u201cbronchial\u201d washing component may dominate the cellular picture.",

Suction can cause airway collapse and traumatization of the airway mucosa, which may reduce recovery volume and change the fluid profile by adding blood. The optimal effect can be driven by the bronchoscopist by visual control. We prefer the use of 20-mL syringes and instillate the fluid directly through the biopsy channel. A recovery of 40\u201370% of the instilled volume is normal. The first aspirate may be the smallest one. Reasons for small recovery rates are emphysema, obstructive airway disease, smoking, or a higher age of the patient. Another important reason is a poor wedge position, which leads to leakage and coughing during BAL. Some reject the first \u201cbronchial\u201d aliquot to avoid changes of the following \u201calveolar\u201d aliquots.

They predominantly affect the distal pulmonary parenchyma including the confined interstitial space bounded by the epithelial and endothelial basement membranes of the alveolar wall. Because of these similarities, they are grouped under ILDs. However, there are significant differences between different ILDs. The etiology, the findings on HRCT and histology differ, as do the clinical course, prognosis, treatment modalities, and response to treatment. Idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs) are a specific subgroup of ILDs of unknown etiology, with distinct histological features. The initial diagnostic approach includes a full medical history (with occupational and environmental exposures or drug reactions), physical examination, laboratory tests, pulmonary function tests, and imaging (chest x-ray and HRCT). If these noninvasive techniques do not lead to diagnosis, more invasive techniques as bronchoscopy including BAL, transbronchial lung biopsy, and surgical lung biopsy have to be considered. Among these procedures, bronchoscopy is the least invasive technique. It is generally well tolerated with very low overall morbidity and mortality [19], but there is a discussion, if bronchoscopy is needed.",

The findings of HRCT play a more and more important role. In ILD, the differential cell counts and specific BAL lavage features can be variable, nonspecific, and insensitive. But often, BAL cellular profiles may help to narrow the differential diagnoses of ILDs and to guide further specific diagnostic interventions.

For this reason, these studies failed to quantify the true added diagnostic value of BAL in diffuse parenchymal lung disease. BAL may be useful in individual patients, in altering the balance of diagnostic probability, but is rarely diagnostic itself. A diagnostic likelihood of only 30\u201370% means major uncertainty. The same reservation applied to the predictive value of CD4/CD8 ratios. The prevailing problem is that no study exists in which BAL data are integrated with the pretest probability of disease, based not only on disease prevalence but also on age, sex, smoking history, mode of presentation, observed disease behavior, observed previous responsiveness to treatment, clinical evaluation, and the results of other tests. The problem has been compounded by the advent of HRCT, which has transformed the diagnostic landscape. The definition of pre-BAL diagnostic probabilities has been refined radically in the HRCT era, and thus, the landmark BAL series of the 1980s are now out of date.

It is associated with a worse outcome if other data are not considered. However, there is ample evidence that in systemic sclerosis, neutrophilia is linked to more extensive pulmonary fibrosis on HRCT and greater pulmonary function impairment. In one recent study, the presence of a BAL neutrophilia had no independent prognostic significance in a large cohort of systemic sclerosis patients, after adjustment for disease severity. Thus, it appears that in systemic sclerosis, a BAL neutrophilia is no more than a marker of disease severity and the same may also apply to other diffuse lung diseases.",

Semiquantitative counting of bacteria helps to differentiate between colonization and infection. As a less invasive procedure, a mini-BAL technique has been described. The diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia is very difficult. It is made by the combination of clinical, radiological, and laboratory criteria (new infiltration, fever or hypothermia, leukocytosis or leukopenia, putrid tracheal secretions) and quantitative culture of tracheal aspirations or BAL. The cutoff of \u2265105 resp. \u2265104 CFU/mL is accepted as an indicator for ventilator-associated pneumonia.",

BAL has been profiled as a pivotal method to obtaining alveolar space and airway specimens for research, and this could lead to more precise longitudinal monitoring of ILD in the future. For example, KL-6, a high molecular weight glycoprotein predominantly expressed on the surface of alveolar type II cells, is a promising biomarker in the field of ILD. Increased levels of KL-6 in BAL fluid and plasma correlate with the severity of alveolar inflammation and poor survival in acute respiratory distress syndrome. Increased levels of KL-6 in both BAL fluid and blood, with a strong correlation between BAL and blood, also reflect disease severity in patients with idiopathic pulmonary alveolar proteinosis.",
