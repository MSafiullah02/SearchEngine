Europe and North America have become the new epicentre of the pandemic and SARS-CoV-2 is expected to rapidly expand in regions relatively unaffected until now (Bedford et al., 2020) . The first COVID-19 case in India was identified in January end, and after a quiet phase numbers are now rising exponentially (Anon, 2020) . As a containment strategy, the government opted for a three week nationwide lockdown, closing all non-essential services and instructing citizens to 'self-quarantine' themselves inside their houses. While a nationwide lockdown presents several difficulties, I would like to outline the potential challenges expected in managing patients with substance use disorders (SUDs) under such circumstances in India.",

A significant number of service users are from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds and the lack of availability of public transport will become a major obstacle to reach treatment centres. This is particularly concerning for patients who are on daily prescriptions of opioid substitution therapy. During the initial two days of lockdown, I came across several patients who travelled 15\u221220 km each way by foot to obtain their methadone doses. Even for those who can manage to reach treatment centres, there remains a constant threat of harassment or physical assault by authorities responsible for ensuring complete lockdown. Furthermore, strict implementation of government policies will make it very difficult for the family members to accompany patients, hence limiting psychosocial interventions.",

Due to the lack of availability of liquor, alcohol users may shift to country/homemade liquor, which can cause severe health related complications (including death) or they may end up in complicated alcohol withdrawal due to forced abstinence. A previous study from India has reported increased presentation of complicated alcohol withdrawal cases due to forced abstinence caused by liquor ban during elections (Narasimha et al., 2018) . Complicated alcohol withdrawal will likely present as altered behaviour, and unreliable history with uncertain COVID-19 status will pose a management challenge for emergency health workers. Furthermore, closure of treatment centres due to lockdown will significantly increase the workload on those treatment centres remaining open. Confusion around COVID-19 status and overloading of existing services will likely result in substandard care and poor outcomes as compared to usual settings.",

In response to the unforeseen circumstances, flexible dosing of buprenorphine (take home doses for 1-2 weeks) and methadone (biweekly refill, in some exceptional cases for 5 days) has been suggested (personal communication with National Drug Dependence Treatment Centre, March 25, 2020). This will help in improving their treatment compliance as well reduce the number of visits during the lockdown. However, since the introduction of methadone in 2015 in India, there is no experience with take home or flexible doses (Ambekar et al., 2018) . COVID-19 spread and the associated lockdown can give rise to psychological distress in patients with SUDs, who in turn are likely to take higher doses of methadone available to them as a coping strategy. Thus, there are chances that patients may overdose or mix several drugs available to them. The situation gets further complicated as naloxone is scarcely available and there is no provision of take home naloxone in India.",

Indian psychiatric society (IPS) and numerous other institutes have started reaching out to patients via telehealth services. While such initiatives are praiseworthy, there are concerns regarding feasibility and acceptability of such approaches for those with SUDs in Indian Settings. Most treatment centres lack dedicated helplines, as well as workforce trained in delivering such services.

Further challenging circumstances are expected once situation improves and lockdown is called off. In the aftermath of the crisis, people are likely to seek more drugs and relapse. Unfortunately during those times, rather than upscaling of SUD services to meet extra demand, these services are likely to be subjected to significantly reduced funding due to crisis, limiting their availability and provisions.",
