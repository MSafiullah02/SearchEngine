The topology of 3a on the cell surface was determined experimentally: its first 34 aa, i.e. before the first transmembrane domain, is facing the extracellular matrix and its C\u2010terminal after the third transmembrane domain (i.e. aa 134\u2013274) is facing the cytoplasm [4]. As 3a is a novel coronavirus structural protein [12, 13], its N\u2010terminal ectodomain would be expected to protrude out of the virion. Interestingly, in two separate cohorts of SARS patients, one from Taiwan [14] and one from Hong Kong [15], B cells recognizing the N\u2010terminal region of 3a were isolated from patients. In addition, it was recently reported that the N terminal of 3a elicits strong and potentially protective humoral responses in infected patients [11]. In this study, rabbit polyclonal antibodies targeted against the N\u2010terminal ectodomain and the C\u2010terminal cytoplasmic domain of the 3a protein were tested for their abilities to inhibit SARS\u2010CoV propagation in Vero E6 culture.",

Similar results were obtained with the other immunized rabbit (Rabbit #3, Fig. 1B), but the relative reactivity to 3a is lower than for Rabbit #2.

Microneutralization assays were performed by mixing a constant amount of virus with different dilutions of rabbit sera and then overlaying the mixture onto Vero E6 cells in 96\u2010well plates. Calculations were made from the cytopathic effect induced in cell culture by the virus as described previously [20]. As shown in Table 2\n, the sera obtained from the rabbit immunized with the N\u2010terminal of 3a (Rabbit #2) showed a neutralization titer of 1:67 for the 1st bleed and 1:80 for the 2nd to 5th bleeds, while the pre\u2010immune serum did not have any neutralizing activity (titer <1:10). In contrast, the anti\u20103a C\u2010terminal antibody did not show any neutralizing activity (Rabbit #1, 6th bleed, titer <1:10), neither did the pre\u2010immune serum from this rabbit. All experiments were performed three times and the average values are showed in Table 2. The neutralizing activities of the rabbit sera from Rabbit #2 were observed even though the components of the complement system have been inactivated by heating. In order to determine if this result is reproducible, the sera from another rabbit immunized with the same 3a N\u2010terminal peptide (Rabbit #3, Fig. 1B) were used for neutralizing assays. Indeed, the results showed that the sera from Rabbit #3 were also neutralizing, albeit with a lower titer of 1:40 (average value obtained for all the bleeds). For comparison, parallel experiments were also performed with a neutralizing antibody targeting 1055\u20131192 aa (S\u039410), which contains the heptad repeat 2 domain known to be important for mediating membrane fusion, of SARS\u2010CoV S protein [17].

It was further demonstrated that anti\u20103a antibodies in the patient serum could bind cells expressing 3a and induce the elimination of these cells in the presence of the human complement system [11]. Several other studies also found that anti\u20103a antibodies were presented only in a subset of SARS patients [4, 9, 10, 22]. In this study, we showed that rabbit polyclonal antibody targeting a 14 aa epitope (aa 15\u201328) in the N\u2010terminal ectodomain of 3a could neutralize the SARS\u2010CoV replication in Vero E6 cells in the absence of the complement system. On the other hand, serum obtained from a rabbit immunized with the C\u2010terminal cytoplasmic domain of 3a (aa 134\u2013274) was not capable of neutralizing SARS\u2010CoV even though it contains a higher amount of 3a\u2010specific antibodies.

Our results showed that antibody targeting the N\u2010terminal of 3a can inhibit SARS\u2010CoV replication, suggesting that 3a can stimulate protective humoral responses during SARS infection. This finding is consistent with a recent report that a higher percentage of patients who recovered from SARS infection have antibodies against the N\u2010terminal of 3a, when compared to the patients who died from SARS infection [11]. Even though the 3a protein is not essential for SARS\u2010CoV replication in cell culture and the murine model [23], it is very likely that 3a contributes to viral replication or pathogenesis in the natural host(s). In future studies, it will be crucial to determine the role of 3a during SARS\u2010CoV infection in non\u2010human primate models, where the animals could develop a disease comparable to that in SARS patients [24]. The precise role of aa 15\u201328 in the N\u2010terminal ectodomain of the 3a protein during SARS\u2010CoV infection also remains to be elucidated.",
