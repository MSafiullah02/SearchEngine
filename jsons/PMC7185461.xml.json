According to several studies from developed countries, the annual incidence of CAP in adults is in the range of 0.5\u20131.1%, and the mortality rate of hospitalized CAP patients is 4\u201314% [2]. Previous reports have suggested that various pathogens including bacteria, fungi, and viruses are associated with CAP [3]. Among these, Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is a major cause of CAP in adult patients, particularly in those with severe diseases [2], [3], [4], [5]. Bacteria such as Haemophilus influenzae, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Legionella pneumophila, and Moraxella catarrhalis are associated with CAP in adult inpatients [2], [3], [4], [5], while other types such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae are detected in relatively mild CAP in outpatients [6].",

Recent molecular epidemiological studies suggest that these viruses can be classified into numerous phylogenetic subtypes and genotypes. Specifically, there are over 150 genotypes of HRV species A to C (HRV-A to -C). Similarly, RSV and HPIV species can be subclassified into several genotypes. Recent studies have demonstrated the presence of these respiratory viruses and/or bacteria in adult patients with CAP [16], [17]. However, the molecular epidemiology in adult CAP Japanese patients is poorly understood.",

In addition, the molecular epidemiology of CAP-associated viruses is poorly understood; although, some CAP-associated respiratory viruses such as HMPV and HRV-C have recently been confirmed [32], [33], [34]. Our results show that HMPV, RSV, HRV, and HPIV are associated with CAP in adult inpatients. The viruses were classified into subgroups and genotypes based on genetic divergence in the phylogenetic trees (Fig. 1a\u2013c). This indicates that viruses such as HMPV, RSV, and HPIV could have been associated with over 10% of CAP inpatients. Although we found no correlation between the phylogenies of these viruses and disease severity, the estimate was inferred from the seasonal prevalence of these strains [35]. Regarding CMV detection, it is not possible to distinguish between active respiratory infection and asymptomatic/latent infection, especially in clinically ill patients [36], [37].",

[44], [45], [46]. Here, bacteria were co-detected in all 4 HRV patients, which might explain the high frequency of invasive mechanical ventilation. Comorbidity may have an impact on the etiology of CAP; some studies have shown that patients with cardiovascular disease are vulnerable to viral CAP [47], [48]. However, we found that the proportions of comorbid illnesses (i.e., COPD, asthma, and chronic heart disease) did not differ between groups (virus alone, bacteria alone, co-detection) (Table 1).",

The following references strains were used: NL/00/1 (AF371337), CAN99-81 (M18759), NL/17/00 (AY304360), CAN97-83 (AY145296), O0601 (EF589610), JPS03-240 (AY530095), NL/1/99 (AY304361), JPS03-194 (AY530094), CAN97-82 (EU814623), JTY06-1 (EU127917), CAN98-75 (M18761), and NL/1/94 (AY304362). (b) Phylogenetic tree of RSV nucleotide sequences based on the G gene (240\u2013312 bp). The phylogenetic tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining method using MEGA software 5.0. Distances were calculated according to Kimura\u2019s two-parameter method. Bootstrap values \u226580% are shown at the branch nodes. The tree includes the present strains (n=3) and reference strains (n=20). The following references strains were used: A2 (M11486), Long (AY911262), AL19452-2 (AF233901), NY20 (AF233918), MO02 (AF233910), SA99V1239 (AF348808), LLC242-282 (AY114150), NY_CH09_93 (AF065254), MO55 (AF233915), LLC235-267 (AY114149), NG-016-04 (AB470478), MY-2444006-11 (JX256871), 18537 (M17213), Ken_2_00 (AY524575), NY01 (AF233931), CH93_9b (AF065251), MO35 (AF233929), BA4128_99B (AY333364), RSV/YOK/07/4 (AB551076), and NG-040-07 (AB470478). (c) Phylogenetic tree for HRV-A nucleotide sequences based on VP4/VP2 coding region (390 bp). The phylogenetic tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining method using MEGA software 5.0. Distances were calculated according to Kimura\u2019s two-parameter method. Bootstrap values \u226580% are shown at the branch nodes. The tree includes the present strains (n=4) and reference strains (n=12). The sequences of the reference strains were obtained from picornaviridae.com (URL: http://www.picornaviridae.com/).",
