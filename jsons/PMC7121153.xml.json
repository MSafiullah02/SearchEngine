            "text": "The reason for uninterpretability is somewhat complicated. A PS oligonucleotide contains a sulfur atom that has been substituted for a nonbridging oxygen atom at each phosphorus in the oligonucleotide chain. These molecules were produced [2] because phosphodiester oligonucleotides (containing linkages identical to what is found in normal DNA) could not be used to silence gene expression either in tissue cultures or in vivo because they were very sensitive to nuclease digestion, especially to 3\u2032-exonucleases [3] and were also rapidly cleared from the plasma through the kidneys. In contrast, phosphorothioates are degraded relatively slowly by nucleases [4] and are also cleared by the kidneys relatively slowly because of their low-affinity binding to plasma proteins (predominantly albumin) [5\u20137]. Further, because sulfur is immediately beneath oxygen in the periodic table, the PS linkage retains the same negative charge as the PO linkage, thus bestowing the property of extreme aqueous solubility. Importantly, the biophysical behavior of PS and PO oligonucleotides in solution are governed by their backbone charge and not by their sequence. In addition, the PS linkage retains the property of being a substrate for the RNase H, a ubiquitous, predominately nuclear enzyme that cleaves the mRNA strand of an mRNA\u2013DNA duplex [8] and apparently functions naturally to eliminate Okazaki fragments. This ostensibly permits gene silencing to occur via a \u201cpseudocatalytic mechanism\u201d requiring only submicromolar concentrations of PS oligonucleotides for efficacy, at least when they are transfected into cells by employing carrier lipids or other vehicles. For all practical purposes, only PO and PS oligonucleotides elicit RNase H activity. (Interestingly, whether the RNAse H mechanism of gene silencing is correct or not, there is mounting evidence that it may be responsible for only a small percentage of total gene silencing. Silencing may actually occur predominately due to the activity of Ago2, the same enzyme with slicer function that cleaves the mRNA strand of an siRNA\u2013mRNA duplex in the RISC complex) [9].",

            "text": "However, despite these important properties of PS oligonucleotides, which have led to their being featured in several important clinical cancer trials, the down side to this chemical modification is that PS oligonucleotides are biochemically fundamentally different from PO oligonucleotides. These differences are most significant in their ability to hybridize to a complementary mRNA strand, which is greatly diminished with respect to an isosequential PO oligonucleotide, and with respect to off-target effects, which are greatly enhanced. Diminished hybridization, reflected in a lower melting temperature (T\nm) of the PS-oligo-mRNA duplex [4], directly correlates with diminished antisense activity and may be part of the reason why some clinical trials with PS oligonucleotides have not been successful, as will be discussed, although other clinically important aspects of study design and disease characteristics may also explain this observation. Fortunately, the more recent development of sugar-modified locked nucleic acids (LNAs) as antisense oligonucleotides appears to have solved the diminished hybridization problem of the PS oligonucleotide. Each LNA incorporated into a PS oligonucleotide (four are commonly employed, two at each molecular terminus) may raise the T\nm of the LNA\u2013mRNA duplex by 4\u20138\u00b0C [10, 11], and hence potentiate gene silencing [12\u201315]. Clinical trials with an anti-Bcl-2 LNA oligonucleotide in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are currently underway, but data are not yet available.",

            "text": "The off-target effects of PS oligonucleotides fall into two basic categories: their ability to bind to heparin-binding proteins and their immunostimulatory properties, which can induce splenomegaly, B-lymphocyte proliferation, and cytokine production. Rodents appear to be particularly sensitive to this phosphorothioate class effect [16]. Neither category of off-target effect will be dealt with extensively in this review, but if these effects are not rigorously controlled for, particularly in experiments in immunosuppressed mice, it may be difficult, if not impossible, to differentiate sequence-specific effects from off-target effects. This has led to a great difficulty in interpreting experimental data [17], as previously noted. The problem is further compounded by the fact that the extent of immune-stimulation by PS oligonucleotides (with or without CpG motifs) in a mouse is very different from that in a human. Unfortunately, this means that preclinical animal models employing PS oligonucleotides may have had little or no predictive value for response in clinical trial patients. Nevertheless, despite these problems, some extremely interesting data have emerged from recent large, randomized, multicenter phase III trials with antisense oligonucleotides, particularly in melanoma and CLL. These trials, in addition to a few provocative phase II\u2013III trials in other cancers, form the basis for the majority of this review. Phase I trials and later-phase trials performed in populations other than cancer patients will not be discussed.",

Bcl-2 is far from the only antiapoptotic protein present in the vast majority of malignant cells. Even in follicular lymphoma cells bearing the t14:18 chromosomal translocation, which produces a fused Bcl-2/immunoglobulin mRNA in about 65\u201370% of cases [26], it is not clear whether the Bcl-2 protein is necessary and sufficient for the maintenance of the neoplastic phenotype. In some tumors, elevated expression of Bcl-2 protein in tumor cells may merely be an epiphenomenon, despite documented clinical correlations between the expression (or \u201coverexpression\u201d) of Bcl-2 protein and a poor prognosis in cancer patients with tumors [27\u201330]. Blagosklonny [31] when addressing this question, noted that Bcl-2 expression in colorectal, breast, and lung carcinomas was associated with an \u201cincreased apoptotic index, lower risk of distant metastases, and improved prognosis.\u201d Furthermore, concordant with much experimental data, cell lines may \u201c\u2026become resistant due to a strong selection during establishment of cells in culture, overexpression of Bcl-2 simply cannot further increase resistance and [the] effects of Bcl-2 are undetectable.\u201d Tumor cells may also become resistant to cytotoxic therapeutics by downregulating proteins in the apoptotic cascade. An example in melanoma is Apaf-1, which is downstream of Bcl-2, and in whose absence, the level of Bcl-2 protein expression would appear to be irrelevant [32].",

Its role in the pathogenesis and prognosis of clinical melanoma is controversial [33] because the protein can be found in normal melanocytes, benign nevi, and primary melanomas, in addition to melanoma metastases [34]. Interestingly, in some studies, Bcl-2 expression was decreased in melanoma cells vs. normal melanocytes [35\u201338]. However, this finding has not been confirmed in other studies [34, 39, 40], in which minimal differences in the expression of Bcl-2 have been observed. To add to the confusion, in advanced melanoma, about one-third of the data suggest an increase in Bcl-2 expression, while one-third suggest a decrease [33], although the function that the Bcl-2 protein actually serves, rather than just the amount of Bcl-2 protein present, would probably be more important. However, one study that was insufficiently powered has demonstrated that if lymph node deposits express Bcl-2, advanced melanoma patients have a poorer prognosis than those who do not [33]. In toto, conflicting data render the role of Bcl-2 in advanced melanoma unclear.",

Recent data demonstrate that the extent to which pretreatment LDH level is increased, even within the \u201cnormal\u201d range, is predictive of prognosis in advanced melanoma [44]. For example, a retrospective examination of data obtained from EORTC study 18951 (N  =  330) demonstrates a monotonic progression to improved prognosis in advanced melanoma patients as the value of LDH decreases, similar to what has been observed in the GM301 trial.

LDH is a ubiquitous enzyme, but its expression is frequently elevated in neoplastic cells because of their shift to glycolysis secondary to relatively poor vascularization and diminished oxygen delivery. Cells dying via the process of necrosis will release LDH, but LDH is not commonly released after apoptosis. Tumor cell survival and the rate of necrosis of tumor cells may often depend on the balance between their rate of proliferation vs. the rate of vascularization of the growing tumor. Therefore, it is possible that high LDH levels in patients may reflect disease that is still growing, but is, at least in part, poorly vascularized. These types of tumors are frequently highly resistant to chemotherapy due to poor oxygen delivery, as well as possibly poor drug delivery (hence the lack of response to treatment).",

For example, hypoxia can induce genetic instability that can select for tumor cells with increased metastatic potential [45\u201347] and, via c-met protooncogene activation, lead to cells that are more aggressive and invasive [48, 49]. Diminished blood flow and low pH can also compromise the functions of tumor-infiltrating immune effector cells and cytokines. Clinical studies [50] have demonstrated that the presence of hypoxic regions within tumors correlates with poor prognosis and increased metastatic risk regardless of treatment \u2013 viz., what is observed in advanced melanoma. Thus, tumor hypoxia leads to necrosis (and thus spillage of LDH) and also ultimately to more aggressive tumors and a poorer prognosis. These ideas predict that the size of the tumor is not the critical factor in either serum LDH levels or prognosis (which it was not in the GM301 trial), but rather that the balance between oxygen supply to the tumor and its intrinsic growth rate is critical.",

The authors offer several possible explanations for the lack of improved efficacy with the oblimersen-containing regimen, one plausible explanation being that oblimersen does not adequately suppress Bcl-2 levels in patients with small-cell lung cancer, as demonstrated in the phase I study undertaken to determine the regimen for this phase II study.",

In a phase I study, Marcucci et al. enrolled 29 untreated patients with AML [55]. All patients were over 60 years of age, had either intermediate or adverse cytogenetics, and initially received induction therapy with oblimersen 7 mg/kg/day by continuous IV infusion on days 1\u201310  +  cytarabine by continuous IV infusion on days 4\u201310  +  daunorubicin IV at one of two doses on days 4\u20136. CR was achieved in 14 patients (48%), and an incomplete remission was achieved in three patients (10%). Levels of normalized Bcl-2 mRNA expression in bone marrow mononuclear cells were found to be decreased from baseline (P  =  0.03) in patients with CR, but increased from baseline (P  =  0.05) in nonresponding patients. Expression of Bcl-2 protein in bone marrow mononuclear cells after 72 h of oblimersen demonstrated a small (about 20%), but \u00adstatistically significant decrease (P  =  0.004) in patients with CR vs. nonresponding patients. However, given recent data that the gymnotic (i.e., naked) delivery of oligonucleotides to cells is a very slow process requiring 6 days or more to produce antisense effects, it is possible that 72 h was an insufficiently long time point for meaningful measurement of the Bcl-2 protein. All patients developed pancytopenia. Toxicities were independent of the daunorubicin dose, as well as reversible and/or \u201cnot directly attributable\u201d to oblimersen.",

In a phase II trial [60], 33 patients relapsing after prior chemotherapy or transplantation received oblimersen 5\u20137 mg/kg/day for 7 days by continuous IV infusion. On day 4, patients received dexamethasone 40 mg orally for 4 days and thalidomide 200 mg/day increasing to 400 mg/day, if tolerated, for the study duration.

The median duration of response was 13 months and the median overall survival was 17.4 months. A rise in polyclonal IgM (from a median of 35.5 to 94 mg/dL) was found to be predictive of response and was suggested to be due to immunostimulation by the oligonucleotide.

The compound has a phosphorothioate backbone and is further modified by the presence of 2\u2032-methoxyethyl (MOE) substituents on the four 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 terminal ribose sugar moieties. The MOE modification appears to dramatically increase the tissue half-life of this oligomer, in part, by increasing its stability vs. nucleases. There is also some evidence that MOE \u201cgap-mers\u201d may have fewer off-target effects, in addition to diminished immunostimulatory properties. In a phase I study in combination with docetaxel [63], serum clusterin levels in the 640 mg dosing group declined approximately 35% after Cycle 1. However, declines in clusterin expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells could not be assessed because of the wide variability in pretreatment \u00adexpression. This trial was followed by a randomized phase II trial of OGX-11 plus docetaxel vs. docetaxel plus prednisone in chemotherapy-naive patients with metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer [64]. Eighty-two patients at 12 centers were randomized to each arm. The docetaxel dose was 75 mg/m2, and the OGX-11 dose was 640 mg. In the initial 56 patients, the toxicity due to OGX-011 included grade 1\u20132 fever and rigors in 37 and 67% of the patients, respectively. Based on a recent press report by Oncogenex, the median survival for patients in the OGX-011 arm was 27.5 months, but only 16.9 months in the control arm.

Does this mean that oblimersen is a one-off, a clinical oddity not to be repeated? Will increasing the T\nm of the oligonucleotide\u2013mRNA duplex by inclusion of LNA lead to improved clinical efficacy? Will recent advances in our understanding of the uptake of oligonucleotides by cancer cells suggest improved dosing schedules? Are siRNAs too \u201cclean\u201d to be active anticancer agents, and how can they be distributed efficiently to targeted cells? There are a large number of questions that need to be answered, but we believe that additional significant clinical advances can only be achieved rationally by a more complete understanding of the fundamental properties of these highly pleiotropic, biologically active compounds.",

            "text": "The field of oligonucleotide-based therapy experienced a revival with the discovery of RNA interference (RNAi) in 1998 [73]. RNAi is a conserved endogenous mechanism, which is triggered by double-stranded (ds) RNAs leading to target-specific inhibition of gene expression by promoting mRNA degradation or translational repression. There are two RNAi pathways that are guided either by small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which are perfectly complementary to the mRNA or by microRNAs (miRNAs), which bind imperfectly to their target mRNA [74]. A breakthrough in the field of siRNA therapeutic agents was achieved by Elbashir et al. [75], who demonstrated that synthetic, exogenously applied dsRNAs of 21 nucleotides in length can induce silencing in mammalian cells. In addition to the siRNA design of 21-mer duplex with 3\u2032-overhangs at both sides, Dicer-substrate formats such as 27-mers or short hairpin (sh) RNAs have been developed that elicit a more potent gene-silencing effect at lower concentrations as compared to conventional 21-mer siRNAs [76\u201378].",

Because RNAi uses a natural pathway for gene silencing, it generally results in a greater potency of knockdown than antisense oligonucleotides or ribozymes. Preclinical results have confirmed the effectiveness of RNAi and have generated serious optimism about the potential for siRNA drugs. As with the other oligonucleotide-based approaches, the applications of siRNAs as a therapeutic agent face most of the above mentioned challenges. Some of these challenges, however, have already been addressed in the course of antisense oligonucleotide and ribozyme development.",

            "text": "Many of the standard stabilizing oligonucleotide modifications that have been already explored for antisense strategies were employed in siRNA designs. SiRNA properties can be beneficially improved by the introduction of certain chemical modifications at distinct positions in the sequence, including thermal stability of the duplex, resistance against degradation, specificity for the target mRNA, reduction of off-target effects, biodistribution, and cellular uptake [79]. In a systematic study, Jackson and coworkers reported that many individual nucleotides in the antisense strand may be modified with 2\u2032-O-Me groups without loss of the silencing potential. A similar study has been performed with 2\u2032-fluoro (2\u2032-F) and 2\u2032-O-MOE [80]. An additional advantage of using 2\u2032-O-Me nucleotides is a reduction in off-target effects [81], as well as avoidance of the interferon responses [82]. The strategic placement of these modifications is crucial. Modifications at the 5\u2032-end of the guide strand can inhibit the silencing effect [83], while modifications at the 5\u2032-end of the passenger strand can improve stability as well as guide strand selection and targeting specificity [84, 85]. Incorporation of 3\u2032-S-phophorothiolate [86], boranophosphates [87], 4\u2032-thioriboses [88], and LNAs [89, 90], were also reported to enhance target-binding affinity and increase silencing potency.",

SiRNAs are in early-stage clinical trials for the treatment of viral infections, cancer, and ocular diseases. Phase I studies are planned for numerous other diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, asthma/allergies, and inflammatory diseases [93]. The most advanced-stage testing for a siRNA-based drug is for the treatment of viral infection and was developed by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (Cambridge, MA, USA). The siRNA ALN-RSV01 was designed against the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which causes severe respiratory illness, primarily in infants [94]. The unmodified siRNAs, administered by inhalation, showed significant viral reduction in experimentally infected adult volunteers compared to the placebo group in a phase II GEMINI study and is now being tested in patients with naturally acquired RSV infection. Other examples of antiviral applications have been proposed for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [95], herpes simplex virus 2 [96], and HIV-1 [97, 98]. Serious concerns about the rapid development of drug-resistant HIV variants make the use of multiple-drug combinations inevitable. Recently, a pilot study of safety and feasibility of stem cell therapy for lymphoma patients with AIDS was initiated using a lentivirus vector encoding three anti-HIV RNAs [99]. The combinatorial approach involves a shRNA targeting tat/rev, an RNA TAR decoy, and an anti-chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) ribozyme.",

The product is in preclinical development for a variety of cancer indications, and the company expects to initiate clinical evaluation in 2009. Two ongoing clinical trials also aim at angiogenesis in age-related macular deficiency (AMD). Bevasiranib (previously known as Cand5) was developed against VEGF and AGN 211745 (previously known as Sirna-027) against its receptor (VEGFR1). Early clinical studies showed that the therapeutic reagents were well tolerated and could prevent neovascularization in the eye after intravitreal injection. AGN 211745 is being investigated in a phase II study in combination with ranibizumab, and patients are currently being enrolled in a phase III study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of bevasiranib. Controversially, a report was recently published suggesting that the suppression of neovascularization in two animal models is a generic property of siRNAs through TLR3 activation, independent of the sequence [100]. This example clearly demonstrates that preclinical studies need to be carefully conducted to prove safety and a specific siRNA-mediated silencing effect. Encouraged by earlier achievements of oligonucleotide-based therapeutics, some RNAi strategies may have been rushed into clinical trials. It is crucial to understand the basic mechanism of RNAi and its diverse related effectors to avoid toxic side effects and to develop rationally designed biopharmaceuticals.",
