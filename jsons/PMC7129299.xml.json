The evolving priorities in the allocation of resources, recruitment and training of health professionals, and the orientation of future intervention programs in disease prevention and control require a global perspective. We cannot afford to view a future that is limited to fulfilling only national priorities. Public health emergencies (e.g., pandemics of infectious diseases) transcend national boundaries and require international collaboration. Another compelling example would be preparedness for bioterrorism, which encompasses the intentional release of bacteria, viruses, or toxins for the purpose of harming or killing civilians (1).",

In the latter half of the 20th century, the emergence of chronic diseases provided a stimulus for enhancing the capacity of the public health infrastructure. Epidemiologists, in recognizing the complexity of the etiology and prevention of emerging chronic diseases, developed an increasing capacity for conducting population-based studies that examined health determinants in relationship to molecular and genetic mechanisms as well as social epidemiologic studies that assessed the contextual significance of social class, neighborhood, and ethnicity (3). It is also apparent that the public health infrastructure comprises a partnership of federal, state, and municipal governmental agencies, nongovernmental organizations, academic research and training institutions, and community-based \u201cstakeholders.\u201d",

Despite advances in developing vaccines, antimicrobials, and the utilization of molecular diagnostic technology, one third of global deaths are caused by infectious diseases. New infectious diseases have achieved public health prominence (e.g., West Nile virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS], avian influenza) and, because of greater population mobility, have the potential to spread globally. Recall the outbreak of SARS that spread from mainland China to Hong Kong, then Singapore and to Canada (4). Thirty-nine new human pathogenic organisms have been identified since 1969, including HIV/AIDS; Marburg, Ebola, and other hemorrhagic viruses; hantaviruses; poxviruses; human herpesviruses, and Asian encephalitis viruses. Many of the emerging infectious diseases are naturally resident in animal populations. Zoonoses often exhibit complex life cycle and transmission dynamics and may result in human-to-human transmission. Understanding the sequence of epidemiologic and pathogenic events will be crucial in preventing and controlling future outbreaks. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has infected a cumulative total exceeding 60 million persons, and more than 90% of those infected reside in developing countries of Africa and Asia (5). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), about 2 billion are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis; concurrent infection with HIV/AIDS is frequently associated with drug-resistant tuberculosis (6).Malaria is responsible for more than one million deaths that occur each year, mostly in infants, young children, and pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa. A preliminary report from Mozambique has described the development of an immunogenic recombinant vaccine that was tested in infants (7). The future utility and deployment of the vaccine will be evaluated in the context of a comprehensive malaria control program.",

These diseases occur primarily in low-income countries of sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America. The interactions of poverty, malnutrition, and debilitating tropical diseases have been documented in the Millennium Declaration of the United Nations (9). The United Nations Millennium Declaration was signed by 189 countries in the year 2000 and translated into goals to be achieved by the year 2015, including alleviation of global poverty, malnutrition, and rising maternal and infant mortality. The infrastructure of such programs will require surveillance registries and the applications of methodologies that assess the multiple factors that influence disease prevalence and vital outcomes.",

In the United States during the past decade, heart disease mortality declined, on average, 6.4% per year, whereas cancer mortality declined about 1.1% per year, or about 5000 cancer deaths per year. Although there have been dramatic declines in mortality in the United States since 1950 attributed to heart disease and stroke combined, the vascular diseases cause about one third of global deaths. The dramatic reductions in vascular mortality in the United States may be explained by population shifts in the distribution of established risk factors and by increasing availability of evidence-based medical and surgical therapies (11). It is estimated that by the year 2020, in a projected population of 7.5 billion, cancer will cause more than 10 million deaths per year worldwide, with about 7 million occurring in developing countries with limited infrastructure for surveillance and integrated preventive medical and diagnostic and therapeutic services (12).",

Future challenges in epidemiology, with implications for graduate student and postdoctoral fellowship training and for developing infrastructure resources, will be the development of biomarkers that enhance the valid measurement of human exposures, the demonstration of variability in susceptibility in population subgroups, and the characterization of the heterogeneity of causal agents and disease entities (21).",
