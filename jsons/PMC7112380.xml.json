We describe the epidemiology in Hong Kong in the first 9 weeks of the epidemic, during which 1425 cases were confirmed, and 122 deaths from SARS occurred.

Primary health care in Hong Kong is provided by private practitioners (80%) and general outpatient departments operated by the public sector. The Hospital Authority also currently provides 95% of total inpatient bed-days.3 The Department of Health provides the public-health function, including the monitoring and control of communicable diseases.4 The eSARS system is designed as a registry and monitoring system. All patients admitted for investigation and observation into the SARS cohort wards in all the hospitals under the Hospital Authority of Hong Kong are recruited on entry. The patients on the registry are progressively classified into: patient under observation, patient suspected of SARS, patient with confirmed SARS, and not SARS. The criteria for inclusion in the eSARS register as a patient confirmed with SARS are radio-graphic evidence of infiltrates consistent with pneumonia, and current fever higher than 38\u00b0C or history of such at any time in the past 2 days, and at least two of the following: history of chills in the past 2 days, cough (new or increased) or breathing difficulty, general malaise or myalgia, and known exposure. Patients are listed as suspected of having SARS if they do not fulfil this definition but are still thought to be likely cases of SARS on the basis of the collective evidence and clinical judgment. However, patients are excluded if an alternative diagnosis can fully explain their illness.",
