Natural products, in particular animal venoms, embody a veritable cornucopia of exotic constituents, suggesting an immensurable source of anti-infective drugs. In this context, melittin, the principal constituent in the venom of the European honeybee Apis mellifera, has been demonstrated to exert anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, anti-infective, and adjuvant properties. To our knowledge, there is no review appertaining to effects of melittin against viruses, prompting us to synopsize experimental investigations on its anti-viral activity throughout the past decades. Accumulating evidence indicates that melittin curbs infectivity of a diverse array of viruses including coxsackievirus, enterovirus, influenza A viruses, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), Jun\u00edn virus (JV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). However, medication safety, different routes of administrations, and molecular mechanisms behind the anti-viral activity of melittin should be scrutinized in future studies.",

In this context, therapeutic properties of venoms for treating neurologic and cardiovascular illnesses, cancer, atopic dermatitis, diabetes, and gastrointestinal maladies have been documented since medieval times [9] .

This uneven distribution of polar and non-polar amino acid residues gives the melittin amphipathic structure when it is folded into an \u03b1-helical configuration [21] . Melittin is composed of two \u03b1-helices connected through a flexible segment [22] . Tetrameric melittin is predominant at concentrations found in the venom sac of the honeybee, but changes in peptide concentration and ionic strength result in tetramer to monomer dissociation [23, 24] . Melittin interacts with cell membranes and induces pore formation at micromolar concentrations, thereby disturbing membrane function and triggering cell lysis [25, 26] .",

Noticeably, some Old World (Lassa and Lujo) and New World (Chapare, Guanarito, Jun\u00edn, Machupo, and Sabia) arenaviruses are responsible for viral hemorrhagic fever, one of the most devastating emergent human diseases, with a fatality rate of 15-30% in untreated cases [48, 49] . For instance, Jun\u00edn virus (JV) causes Argentine hemorrhagic fever, a severe viral illness endemic to the humid pampas of Argentina, with roughly five million people at risk [50] . Though ribavirin is the only approved anti-viral agent for treating arenaviruses in the USA; however, it exhibits undesirable secondary reactions [32, 51] . Thus, there is exigency to develop efficient therapeutics against arenaviruses.",

Melittin had no satisfactory anti-viral activity against BVDV, before and after infection of Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells with the virus (multiplicity of infection; MOI = 0.1). Intriguingly, combinations of melittin with bee venom-derived apamin were superior against BVDV than each agent alone, highlighting that apamin potentiates anti-BVDV efficacy of melittin [33] .

HSV entrance into cells occurs following fusion of viral envelope with host cell membrane. Several glycoproteins are involved in HSV-induced cell fusion [60] . It is worth mentioning that wild-type HSV-1 strains usually induce a limited amount of cell fusion, while certain HSV mutants known as syn mutants lead to extensive syncytium formation [61] . Disturbance of trans-membrane ion gradients impedes HSV-1-induced cell fusion [62] . This fact together with perturbation effects of melittin on Na + , K + pump [63] propelled researchers to explore whether melittin influences HSV-1-induced cell fusion [34] . Fusion of Vero cells infected with HSV strains (MP, syn20, and FFV3) harboring the syn1 mutation in glycoprotein K was inhibited in the presence of melittin (0.5 \u03bcM), with no evidence of cytotoxicity toward Vero cells (Table 1) . By contrast, melittin (0.5 \u03bcM) failed to affect cell fusion induced by HSV strains containing mutations in glycoprotein B (tsB5 and amb 1511-7). In presence of melittin, binding of ouabain (a specific inhibitor of the Na + , K + ATPase) to the Na + , K + pump of HSV-1-infected Vero cells was drastically diminished. The peptide also reduced HSV-1 yield in Vero cells compared to untreated control. In addition, the authors found that melittin is able to obstruct HSV-1 attachment onto Vero cells in a dose-dependent manner and to hinder HSV-1 penetration into cells [34] .",

Similarly, an extensive hemolysis (94.6%) occurred at concentration of 80 \u03bcg/mL [35] . It has been also evinced that 3 \u03bcM of melittin curbed in vitro infectivity of both HSV-1 and HSV-2 by 80%. Incubation of Vero cell with melittin (> 5 \u03bcM) at 37\u00b0C for 24 h resulted in cell rounding and monolayer detachment, as manifested by light microscopy [32] . Selectivity index of melittin was calculated to be 6.30 and 4.15 for HSV-1 and HSV-2, respectively ( Table 2 ). In another major study, Uddin et al. found that melittin directly inhibits Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)-fused HSV (EC 50 of 0.94 \u00b1 0.07 \u03bcg/mL) [36] , which corroborates the findings of the earlier investigations [32, 34, 35] . Compared to untreated viruses, melittin treatment of GFP-HSV minimized not only GFP expression in infected cells but also viral titers (16-fold). A new investigation [33] revealed the potential antiviral effects of melittin on bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BoHV-1, Los Angeles strain). Administration of melittin (2 \u03bcg/mL) on Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells before and after infection with BoHV-1 (MOI = 0.1) resulted in marked reduction of viral titers. In light of virucidal kinetics, complete obliteration of BoHV-1 was achieved after a 2-h incubation of the virus with 25 \u03bcg/mL of melittin at 37\u00b0C [33] , implying rapid anti-viral effects of melittin. Given that melittin curtails the infectivity of HSV in several ways, it is imperative to evaluate its anti-viral effectiveness against other members of Herpesviridae as well.",

In this regard, 1.15 \u00b1 0.09 \u03bcg/mL of melittin was sufficient for 50% reduction in plaque-forming units (PFUs) of GFP-fused influenza A (H1N1, PR8-GFP). Furthermore, CC 50 of melittin was 7.66 \u00b1 0.94 \u03bcg/mL for Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Considering both antiviral and cytotoxic activities, selectivity index of melittin was 6.66 ( Table 2 ), inferring that anti-influenza activity of melittin does not emanate from cytotoxic effect of the peptide [36] . In initial stages of infection, melittin (2 \u03bcg/mL) did not interfere with both cell attachment and entry of PR8-GFP strain. When PR8-GFP strain was co-incubated with melittin (for 30 min at 4\u00b0C), waning in viral mass was observed, as evaluated by velocity sedimentation ultracentrifugation and subsequent immunoblotting [36] . At 24 h post-infection, melittin treatment (2 \u03bcg/mL, 30 min) of PR8-GFP led to significant reduction in viral titers (5-fold, P < 0.01) and GFP expression compared to untreated PR8-GFP. These data suggest direct effect of melittin on PR8-GFP surface, prior to virus-cell attachment. Li et al. postulated that surface charge interactions between a cationic peptide from scorpion venom named Mucroporin-M1 and influenza H5N1 can diminish viral infectivity [68] . Thus, melittin may interact with phospholipid bilayer of viral envelope through electrostatic interactions and destabilize viral particles, eventually leading to virolysis.",

In this respect, melittin attenuated HIV-1 production in HUT78-RF (chronically HIV-1-infected T cells), HUT78 (acutely HIV-1-infected T cells), and LC5-CD4 (acutely HIV-1-infected fibroblasts) in a dose-dependent manner. In the case of melittin-treated cells, metabolic activity at the 50% infectious dose (ID 50 ) was higher than 85% of control cultures. Furthermore, western blot analysis indicated that levels of Gag antigen declined in KE37/1 (acutely HIV-1-infected T lymphoma cells) lysates following 9 days treatment with melittin (1.05 and 1.4 \u03bcM) compared to controls [42] . Quantitative reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results also demonstrated that melittin does not suppress expression of porphobilinogen deaminase, a cellular housekeeping gene. Interestingly, melittin suppresses HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) activity in a Tat-independent manner, indicating that melittin interferes with host cell-directed viral gene expression [42] . All the cumulative evidence indicates that dosedependent anti-HIVeffect of melittin is mediated by suppressing HIV transcription and decreasing overall levels of viral gene products rather than the lysis of cellular or viral membranes.",

In order to quantify HIV-1 infectivity, the authors applied TZM-bl cell line, which is HeLaderived cells capable of expressing CD4, CCR5, and CXCR4. The cell line also harbors luciferase reporter gene under the control of an HIV-1 promoter [77] . After incubation of 50 ng HIV-1 NLHX (CXCR4 tropic) or HIV-1 NLYU2 (CCR5 tropic) strains with soluble CD4 (served as a positive control), nanoparticles, and free melittin at 37\u00b0C, treated viruses were exploited to infect TZM-bl reporter cells for 48 h at 37\u00b0C. This is followed by lysing the cells and gauging luciferase activity (as a measurement of HIV-1 infectivity). Remarkably, free melittin at concentrations greater than 6 \u03bcM was able to extirpate infectivity of both NLHX and NLYU2 strains. Although 2 \u03bcM of free melittin did not influenced viability of TZM-bl reporter cells, concentrations above 2 \u03bcM rapidly diminished cellular viability, indicating a narrow therapeutic range of melittin. Contrary to free melittin, melittin-loaded nanoparticles had no toxicity toward vaginal keratinocytes in vitro [43] . Besides, 50% inhibitory concentration of melittin-loaded nanoparticles were 2.4 and 3.6 \u03bcM against NLHX and NLYU2 strains, respectively, with no adverse effects on reporter cell viability. Lipid-to-lipid membrane hemifusion events may facilitate melittin transportation from nanoparticle lipid monolayers to HIV-1 envelope bilayers, subsequently resulting in melittin aggregation, pore formation, and deactivation of viral packaging [43] . Simplicity of nanoparticle production, lack of melittin nanoparticles toxicity against vaginal keratinocytes, and their potential in reducing HIV-1 infectivity are striking properties of this approach for intra-vaginal prevention of HIV transmission.",

At concentrations equivalent to 25 and 50 \u03bcM, both melittin-loaded liposomes and immunoliposomes were capable of inhibiting VHSVinfected cell foci formation in a dose-and time-dependent manner. For instance, inhibition rates of VHSV infectivity were 89.9% and 95.2% in the presence of melittin-loaded liposomes (50 \u03bcM) and immunoliposomes (50 \u03bcM), respectively. Both melittin-loaded liposomes and immunoliposomes interdicted the infectivity of VHSV after virus adsorption to fish cell line epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) at time point 0 and 4 h post-infection [37] . In addition, EPC cell monolayers exhibited > 80% viability after a 24-h exposure to melittin-loaded liposomes (25 \u03bcM) and immunoliposomes (50 \u03bcM) at 14\u00b0C.

In contrast to the placebo group receiving PBS, treatment with melittin led to a constant improvement in cats' general health status, expressed as Karnofsky's score. Statistically, a significant difference (P = 0.015) in improvement of conjunctivitis was observed between melittin-treated and placebotreated cats. Although both groups exhibited amelioration of stomatitis, however, this was not significant. Moreover, no adverse effects including hemolysis and irritation at the injection site in FIV-infected cats were noted [84] . In the case of laboratory parameters (e.g., packed cell volume, hemoglobin, and white blood cells), there were no statistically significant differences between both groups. As for immunologic parameters including CD4 + lymphocytes, CD8 + lymphocytes, and CD4/CD8 ratio, no significant differences between both groups were evident. Similar results were also observed with regard to surrogate parameters (biopterin and 7-xanthopterin in serum and urine) in both groups. Authors stated that lack of significant changes could be attributable to various reasons including inability of melittin to yield strong anti-viral activity in vivo, administration of low dosage of melittin, long treatment intervals, short length of treatment period, and development of antibodies against melittin [84] . Overall, assessment of changes in FIV load together with increasing the total number of cats should be considered for future investigations to provide more trustworthy statistical findings.",

Many AMPs act primarily through membrane disruption [85] . In this context, direct interaction of melittin with viral envelopes or capsid proteins interferes with binding or uptake of viruses by cells [34, 42, 43] . Besides, other plausible anti-viral mechanisms of action such as impediment of viral multiplication [36] , decreasing expression levels of viral mRNAs [36, 42] , inducing conformational changes in viral genome [44] , deactivation of viral packaging [43] , attenuation of viral cytopathic effects [36] , and inhibition of viral-induced cell fusion [34] have been documented in the literature, as depicted in Fig. 1 .",

Multiple approaches can be propounded to diminish cytotoxicity of melittin while augmenting its anti-viral effects, thereby heightening therapeutic indices of the peptide. In this regard, targeted in vivo delivery of AMPs like melittin through a nanocarrier exemplifies a safe solution with desirable pharmacokinetics for both anti-viral and anti-cancer therapies [86, 87] . An alternate novel enticing strategy is conjugation of melittin with aptamers, which are oligonucleotide or peptide molecules capable of binding to their targets with high affinity and specificity [88] . Designing hydrogels embedded with melittin for topical treatment of herpes blisters and papilloma virus-related warts is the other practicable approach which has not been reported hitherto. Last but not least, combination of melittin and current anti-viral drugs may reduce both concerns associated with cytotoxicity of melittin and probability of developing drug-resistant viruses.",

As a consequence, future investigations may need to focus on deciphering mechanisms behind the anti-viral activity of melittin, examining various routes of administrations, and scrutinizing the effectiveness of melittin in primate models to retrieve additional pre-clinical data. Undoubtedly, anti-infective properties of melittin will provide new avenues in all fields of clinical researches, particularly medical virology.",
