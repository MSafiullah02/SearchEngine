Observational and experimental research has thus found public attitudes to be highly responsive to cues from parties (Berinsky, 2009; Lenz, 2012; Mondak, 1993), especially on novel, \u201chard\u201d issues where citizens are dependent on the news media for information (Tesler, 2018; Zaller, 1992).",

For example, there is substantial evidence that divided political elites polarized American attitudes toward climate science (Carmichael and Brulle, 2017; Merkley and Stecula, forthcoming; Tesler, 2018). Polarization can only be avoided if elites send signals of consensus (Berinsky, 2009; Zaller, 1992). Most research on cue-taking has been situated in the United States, but some work has illustrated the importance of elite cues comparatively (Bischof and Wagner, 2019) and in Canada specifically (Merolla et al., 2016).",

Divided parties send polarizing signals to the mass public that could undermine efforts to fight the virus. In the United States, Republican officials voiced skepticism about the severity of the pandemic early in the crisis, and attitudes toward COVID-19 are heavily polarized, perhaps as a result (Gadarian et al., 2020). The past few decades have seen polarization increase in Canada (Cochrane, 2015). Here, we evaluate the degree to which the politics in Canada regarding COVID-19 can be characterized by partisan polarization.",

To assess elite cues, we collected all tweets from MPs who use Twitter (292 accounts, with a total of 33,142 tweets since January 1, 2020). We used keyword searches to classify tweets into one or more topics. We calculate the share of MP tweets mentioning COVID-19 by party and then benchmark these series against other issues (environment and immigration). Hand-coding was done on all tweets related to COVID-19 in order to identify signals downplaying the severity of the crisis and messages promoting social distancing.",

We average these two periods together at the municipal level (N = 87). These data show the relative difference in search interest in the coronavirus between municipalities. We obtained municipal-level estimates of the Conservative party's (CPC) vote share in 2015, as well as population size (logged), population density (logged), average median income, and share of population with a postsecondary education.1 We construct an urban index, with population size and density, and a socio-economic status (SES) index, from education and income levels (both scaled 0\u20131).

Data were weighted within each region of Canada by gender and age, based on data from the 2016 Canadian census.

Consequently, we construct two indices of social distancing from these factors, scaled from 0 to 1. Factor loadings can be found in Table A1 of the appendix.
