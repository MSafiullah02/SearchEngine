Providers should remain mindful of procedures that produce aerosols, and ensure proper precautions are in place should these interventions be necessary. Remote communication remains a potential option, though should not entirely replace face-to-face contact and examination. Supportive care is currently the cornerstone of therapy for COVID-19 patients, who in turn require proper monitoring for signs of renal or cardiac dysfunction. Patients with lower respiratory involvement are susceptible to secondary bacterial infection and may require antibiotic therapy in some cases.3\n,\n4\n,\n12 While experience with corticosteroids is limited, their routine use is not recommended due to lack of efficacy in other severe coronavirus outbreaks.15 Corticosteroid therapy should only be considered in select situations, such as refractory shock or severe ARDS.16 Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 appears to be the receptor utilized by SARS-CoV-2, raising debate of competing risks and benefits of angiotensin receptor blocking agents.17 It remains unclear if this class of medications is beneficial or harmful. Interim guidelines recommend continuing ACE inhibitors in patients who are on these medications but not start in new patients.18 Likewise, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have not been sufficiently studied in COVID-19; however, these medications have been associated with worse outcomes in community-acquired pneumonia19 and some experts warn against their use in COVID-19.20 Management of COVID-19 is summarized in Table 2\n.",

Patients should be instructed to quarantine at home, minimize any close social interactions, and wear a mask for any such interactions. Quarantine should continue until certain conditions are met. Recently, a non-test-based strategy has been adopted for in-home patients. In this strategy, patients can discontinue isolation once there have been three days since resolution of fever, improvement in respiratory symptoms, and seven days have passed since symptoms began.27 A point of contact should be available for in-home patients to ensure they have met these criteria prior to discontinuing isolation. A patient may be considered for discontinuation of isolation while inpatient if they have resolution of fever without antipyretic medication, improvement in symptoms, and negative results in two consecutive sets of paired nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal PCR swabs at least 24 hours apart.28 Their contacts should be tested for SARS-CoV-2, even if they remain asymptomatic as shedding can still occur.
