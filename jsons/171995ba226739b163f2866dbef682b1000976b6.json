The severe 23 acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-COV-2) was found at very high concentrations in 24 swab and sputum of such cases. 25 Objective: We aimed to estimate virus release from such cases into different aerosol sizes by 26 normal breathing and coughing, and what exposure can result from this in a room shared 27",

While the bigger portion of the 140 emitted viral load is in the form of large particles that can deposit rapidly, there is also an 141 important portion in the smaller size fractions. Small aerosols can remain airborne for an 142 extended time 16 and are very effective at reaching the deeper regions of the lungs. 143 An average person breathes about a half m 3 per hour in resting state 19 , which can rapidly 144 increase to several m 3 during exercise 20 . Thus, a person spending time in a room with an 145 average emitting patient breathing normally has a realistic chance of inhaling tens to 146 hundreds of copies of the virus even when keeping distance from that person. The situation 147 is worse in the presence of a high emitter and worst if the patient is a coughing high emitter. 148 A review of a wide range of respiratory viruses suggests that the infective dose is often quite 149 low. Sometimes as few as few hundred units of active virus (TCID50) 21 seem sufficient to 150 provoke a disease. Thus, our modelling suggests that there is a clear risk of infections for a 151 person spending an extended time in the room with an infected person, even if the distance 152 is too large for direct transmission. The situation is worse if the person is coughing. 153",
