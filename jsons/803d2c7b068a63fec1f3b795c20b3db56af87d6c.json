The current evidence suggests that otolaryngologists are particularly at risk for acquiring the infection secondary to the nature of the profession's close contact with the upper respiratory tract, which harbors a high viral load. [1] [2] [3] The primary mode of viral transmission is thought to occur via the spread of respiratory droplets, which carry virus particles approximately 0.125 microns in size. 4 These have been documented traveling distances of greater than 2 m and contaminating surfaces on which they land. 5 In addition, there is a significant concern for airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs). 6 This has led to the recommendation from the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery to limit elective procedures involving mucosal disruption or aerosolizing sprays, which may include nasal endoscopy, functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS), and endonasal approaches involving the use of powered instrumentation. 7, 8 Despite these recommendations, there is a current lack of evidence quantifying the risk associated with these procedures.",

[11] [12] [13] [14] As of the time of this publication, conflicting information persists among regulatory bodies as to degree of protection required for aerosol-generating procedures. 15, 16 While available evidence seems to suggest that spread is primarily through respiratory droplets, there is no consensus on exact transmission and little research available attempting to evaluate risk of specific otolaryngologic procedures. In otolaryngology clinical practice, many procedures involve instrumentation and examination of areas suspected to carry high viral loads: the nose, nasopharynx, and oropharynx. 17 As practitioners begin to entertain a reverse surge into practice, knowledge of how these routine procedures generate droplets and aerosols is paramount to keeping health care providers and patients safe.",

There were limited amounts of contamination visualized following FESS with microdebrider and powered drilling of the sphenoid rostrum and frontal beak, and all observed droplet sizes were less than 1 mm. The use of a concurrent suction while drilling resulted in no contamination. The suction was used as per routine in a normal surgical setting to suck away pooled irrigation and accumulated bone dust. The reduced pooling of irrigation may have prevented the drill from splashing and propelling droplets out of the nasal cavity. Interestingly, even in the test conditions that resulted in contamination, there was a very limited spread of droplets. In fact, the farthest contamination distance was found to be 12 cm in the drilling of the sphenoid rostrum without concurrent suction. As expected during the control condition, activating a drill outside of the nose resulted in gross contamination with a maximum contamination distance of 13 cm and larger droplet sizes. These findings suggest that the soft tissue boundaries of the nasal cavity function as a barrier in preventing splatter and droplet contamination.",

All dissections in our study were performed using standard operating technique, minimizing use of powered instrumentation external to the patient or anteriorly in the nose. During the experimental conditions involving a drill, the powered instrument was only activated endonasally, used with the objective of performing key rhinological procedures in standard fashion, and was performed for 3 minutes rather than 10 seconds. Through this approach, we believe our droplet distribution simulates durations seen more frequently in the operating room environment. Running a contaminated drill externally as a control condition replicated the previously reported findings in showing gross contamination. Furthermore, the droplet contamination caused by the drill was completely mitigated by the use of concurrent suction.",

Based on these findings, the development of suction capabilities for endoscopic endonasal drills to help mitigate the risks of droplet contamination or automatic off switches when drills or debriders are moved outside of the patient may be important. In reviewing the literature, we also believe it is an important and new finding that the activation of the ultrasonic aspirator both endonasally and externally resulted in no observable droplet or splatter contamination.",

However, it is still vital to understand the quantity, quality, and range of droplet and splatter contamination involved during these common procedures, considering respiratory droplets are considered the primary mode of transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Another limitation is that only droplets and splatter visible to the human eye were measured. Endoscopic visualization and measurement of contamination using a blue light filter was attempted, but unfortunately, the authors found it less sensitive secondary to a glare effect. Moreover, instead of a complete 360-degree assessment, the design model allowed for measurements only in the cardinal directions surrounding the specimen.",

Our results indicate that there is very little droplet generation from key rhinologic procedures such as functional endoscopic sinus surgery and transsphenoidal pituitary approaches. This droplet generation was completely mitigated with the use of concurrent suction in the anterior nasal cavity. However, extreme caution should be used to avoid activating powered instrumentation outside of the nasal cavity, as this was found to cause droplet contamination. While these findings are encouraging, further study is warranted to determine the safety of these cases in the current environment.",
