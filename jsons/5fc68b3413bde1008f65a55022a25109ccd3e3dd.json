For example, both questions will lead to a consideration of the availability of low-cost housing and the ability of the health care system to care for patients with severe mental illness. However, the distinction between these two questions is important as they distinguish factors associated with the likelihood of being homeless due to health reasons versus the likelihood of consequences given homelessness. At another level, it is also important to distinguish if outcomes and their associated factors vary between cities, both in terms of the structural factors that generate homelessness and (given homelessness) health of those who are homeless. These questions frame the issue of the impact of the urban environment on the health of disadvantaged populations.",

In most cases, the relative importance of these factors in determining the health of homeless people and the prevalence of homelessness remains the subject of ongoing debate.",

However, any consideration of the common health problems of homeless people must first recognize the large degree of heterogeneity among people who are homeless. Among street youth, single men, single women, and mothers with children, the patterns of illness differ notably. Adolescents suffer from high rates of suicide attempts, sexually transmitted diseases, and pregnancy (Greene and Ringwalt, 1996; Greene and Ringwalt, 1998; Greene, et al., 1999; Feldmann and Middleman, 2003) . Female heads of homeless families tend to have far fewer health problems than single homeless women, although their health is poorer than their counterparts in the housed general population (Robertson and Winkleby, 1996) . Homeless single men have a higher prevalence of alcohol abuse and drug abuse, whereas single women have a higher prevalence of serious mental illness (Fischer and Breakey, 1991) .",

Common psychiatric diagnoses among homeless people include major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and personality disorders. A systematic review of the prevalence of schizophrenia in homeless persons found rates ranging from 4 to 16% and a weighted average of 11% in the ten methodologically strongest studies . Characteristics associated with a higher prevalence of schizophrenia were younger age, female sex, and chronic homelessness.

Homeless people with TB require more hospital-based care than non-homeless people with TB, resulting in average hospital costs that are higher by $2,000 per patient. (Marks, et al., 2000) Contact tracing in the homeless population is difficult, and in one study only 44% of identified contacts completed treatment for latent TB infection (Yun, et al., 2003) . Among street youth, latent tuberculosis is more common than in the general population, but probably less prevalent than among homeless adults.

In a study from Scotland that adjusted for age and socioeconomic deprivation, the incidence of cancer of the oral cavity and pharynx, larynx, esophagus, and lung in homeless men was 139%, 87%, 61%, and 23% higher than expected, respectively (Lamont, et al., 1997) . Homeless people are also less likely to receive recommended cancer screening than the general population: among homeless women age 40 and over in Los Angeles County, only 55% had undergone a Pap smear and only 32% had undergone a mammogram within the last year (Chau, et al., 2002) .

These determinants have been grouped into categories encompassing the demographic and physical characteristics of urban centers (population and climate), their socioeconomic and service-delivery structures (income and poverty, social welfare systems, and health care systems), and their spatial and political organization (urban geography and urban governance).

There is limited information on the relationship between population size and prevalence of homelessness in different urban centers. One reason for this paucity of data is the logistical difficulty of conducting an accurate count of homeless persons, particularly those living on the street. Another reason is that point-prevalence counts of the homeless population cannot be used to determine how many individuals are homeless in a city over an entire year, especially given seasonal fluctuations in the homeless population and the fact that homelessness is a transient state.",

In 1992, an estimated 1.0% of the 1.5 million residents of Philadelphia and 1.2% of the 7.2 million inhabitants of New York City stayed at a homeless shelter at least once (Culhane, et al., 1994) . In Toronto, Canada, 1.3% of the city's total population of 2.5 million used a homeless shelter during 2002. These figures are remarkably similar and strikingly high. Thus, homelessness is quite common in large urban centers, although for many individuals the duration of homelessness is quite brief. In a U.S. survey of homeless people, 28% had been homeless for only 3 months or less, 26% had been homeless for 4-12 months, and 46% had been homeless for more than one year (Burt, 2001) .",

The maximum size of a city's shelter population is obviously determined by the number of available shelter beds. In a city with few shelters, this can create the illusion of a smaller homeless population than is actually the case. In addition, shelter beds may be less widely available in cities that do not experience severe cold weather in the winter. In the nine largest metropolitan areas in Canada, the number of shelter beds per capita ranges more than four-fold, from 21 to 97 per 100,000 population (Hwang, 2001) . The number of shelter beds per capita is not significantly correlated with population size. Interestingly, the lowest number of shelter beds per capita in Canada was observed in Vancouver, a city with a very mild climate, and the highest figure was seen in Calgary, a city with extremely cold winters. Overall, this evidence suggests that episodes of homelessness are quite common among residents of major urban centers, but there is significant variation in the prevalence of homelessness across cities that does not necessarily correlate with population size.",

As noted above, in cities with warmer climates, a larger proportion of the homeless population is likely to be found on the street rather than in shelters. People living on the street are more likely to be disengaged from the health care and social service systems, and typically these individuals have poorer health than shelter-dwelling homeless people (Cousineau, 1997) . In colder climates, exposure to the elements has an obvious adverse impact on the health of homeless people, who face serious risks from trench foot, frostbite, and injury or death from hypothermia (Tanaka and Tokudome, 1991) .

Some have argued, based on historical data, that an increase in the number of unmarried men with very low income is a particularly important explanatory factor for adult homelessness (Jencks, 1994) . During the latter half of the twentieth century, the earning potential of men with limited education was greatly diminished by the decline of manufacturing jobs in urban centers (Wilson, 1987; . At the same time, the availability of open-market sources of low-cost housing such as single-room occupancy hotels and rooming houses shrank steadily due to gentrification and urban renewal (Hasson and Ley, 1994) . In this setting, the level of government support for subsidized rental housing plays a key role in determining the availability of units that a low-income individual or family can afford; the 1980's saw a decline in this support in both the U.S. and the United Kingdom (Cohen, 1994) .",

Thus, the poor health observed among homeless people may be explained in large part by the fact that they experience extreme poverty and deprivation, rather than the fact that they happen to be homeless at the present time. This is particularly likely to be the case for individuals who have only recently become homeless, and less so for the chronically homeless, who have been subjected to the adverse health effects of lack of housing for a lengthy period. To extend this concept further, homelessness is a marker for severe poverty in the urban environment, and it may be this level of poverty, rather than the negative impact of homelessness itself, that has the greatest effect on population health in urban centers. This issue is discussed further in section 4 of this chapter.",

In coming years, as families that are unable to become self-supporting begin reaching the 60-month federal time limits on benefits, their risk of becoming homeless may be greatly affected by the policies of the state in which they live. In contrast, most European Union countries have extensive social welfare and public housing systems that make family homelessness less common.",

On one hand, the health of homeless people should improve if public benefits allow them to obtain food, housing, and other essentials of life. On the other hand, increased income could be detrimental to health if the money is used to purchase alcohol or drugs. One of the few studies on this issue examined 173 homeless mentally ill veterans who applied for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI). The 50 individuals who were eventually awarded benefits did not differ in their past history of substance use from the 123 individuals who were eventually denied benefits. Three months after the decision to award or deny benefits, the group that was awarded benefits had significantly higher average total income (by $277 per month) and higher quality of life than the group that was denied benefits. There was no evidence of increased alcohol or drug use or deterioration in psychiatric status among those who received benefits (Rosenheck, et al., 2000) .",

The availability and quality of homeless shelters vary greatly. As noted previously, homeless people in cities with few shelter beds are more likely to live on the street or other places not intended for human habitation, with potentially adverse health effects. In addition, the staff at homeless shelters can play an important role in connecting homeless people to social services, job training, housing applications, and substance abuse treatment. The quantity and quality of food provided at shelters determines to a large extent the nutritional value of homeless people's diets, with potential downstream health effects (Dachner and Tarasuk, 2002) . Finally, the physical environments at shelters range from extremely crowded, poorly ventilated, and unsanitary facilities to modern, clean, and well-run establishments. Adverse shelter conditions have an impact on the transmission of tuberculosis and viral respiratory infections and the prevalence of health conditions such as skin infestations and asthma exacerbations. Shelter conditions could also plausibly have an effect on mental and emotional well-being among residents. To date, however, little research has examined the effects of the physical shelter environment on the health of homeless persons, with the exception of the relationship between crowding and poor ventilation in shelters and the transmission of tuberculosis (Advisory Council for the Elimination of Tuberculosis, 1992b).",

In the U.S., 55% of homeless people lack health insurance, creating a significant barrier to obtaining care (Kushel, et al., 2001) . These individuals are dependent on state-or city-based systems designed to provide care for the indigent. In many large urban centers in the U.S., a designated public, county, or charity hospital provides the majority of hospital-based health care for homeless people. Some cities have free-care clinics or community health centers that provide ambulatory services for homeless persons as well as other low-income residents. In 161 U.S. cities, federally-funded Health Care for the Homeless Programs have established multidisciplinary teams of physicians, nurses, social workers, and outreach workers that provide care to homeless people on the street and in shelters. This limited set of health care providers is typically the only source of care available to homeless people in urban areas in the U.S., and the local funding and staffing level of these organizations is a critical determinant of access to health care. For homeless veterans, the proximity and availability of Veterans Health Administration services is also an important factor.",

For example, the provision of universal health insurance does not necessarily result in the establishment of outreach programs for homeless people, appropriate treatment programs for homeless persons with mental illness or substance abuse, or an adequate supply of health care providers who are willing, able, and trained to work with this challenging population (Buchanan, et al., 2004) . In the United Kingdom, individuals must register with a general practitioner to obtain primary care, and some physicians are reluctant to accept homeless people into their practice because of their complex needs and the extra workload entailed (Wood, et al., 1997) . Health insurance does not protect against the fragmentation and discontinuity of care that homeless people often experience, nor does it eliminate the daily struggle to meet basic survival needs that may cause homeless people to place a lower priority on seeking health care (Gelberg, et al., 1997) .",

Beginning in the 1960's and 1970's, the advent of effective anti-psychotic medications to treat schizophrenia and an understandable desire to move people out of chronic mental hospitals, where conditions were sometimes horrendous, led to the discharge of tens of thousands of long-term psychiatric patients (Dear and Wolch, 1987; Jencks, 1994) . The number of beds at psychiatric institutions fell precipitously. In theory, these patients were supposed to receive mental health care and social support in the community. In reality, many of these patients received little if any services and ended up swelling the ranks of the homeless population in the 1970's and 1980's.",

They examined how deinstitutionalization, rollbacks in entitlements to social assistance, and changes in the global economy in the late 1970s and early 1980s combined to create complex problems of poverty, inequality, and homelessness in North American cities that persist to this day. Dear and Wolch (1987) argued that these problems manifested themselves in the specific urban form of the \"service-dependent ghetto,\" which refers to the spatial concentration in the inner city of service-dependent populations (such as people with mental illness, physical handicaps, addictions, or recent incarceration) and the organizations that assist them. While on one hand these can be characterized as areas of \"urban blight,\" Dear and Wolch (1987) argued that they serve as a supportive environment and adaptive coping mechanism that can have a positive effect on the health and well-being of residents who have few other options. Servicedependent ghettos are often the object of antagonism from surrounding communities. Paradoxically, however, these more affluent communities often perpetuate the forces that create the service-dependent ghetto and entrench processes of inner-city decay through citizen resistance to housing and services for low-income people and exclusionary land use policies and zoning practices (Dear and Taylor, 1982) .",

Some cities have numerous well-tended public spaces such as parks and squares that are conducive to those who wish to linger or rest, including homeless people. These spaces can serve a socially cohesive function if urban dwellers of diverse backgrounds perceive them to be safe \"neutral\" spaces in which to gather and socialize. In contrast, other cities have built environments that lack such public spaces and are instead dominated by privatized quasi-public spaces such as shopping malls. Nonpurposeful lingering, which would be generally acceptable in a public space such as a park, is perceived as \"loitering\" in such places. In a relatively trivial but very specific expression of hostility toward homeless people, some cities have installed \"bum-proof\" benches that are designed to prevent reclining or sleeping on the seat. While these elements of the urban environment seem relatively minor, they may reflect a city's prevailing sentiment towards homeless and poor people that sets the tone of their daily existence (Davis, 1990 ).",

Some consider the visible presence of homeless people in parks, street corners, and other public spaces to be a manifestation of \"urban disorder\" and a barrier to the successful promotion of commerce and tourism. In response to these concerns, a number of cities have enacted by-laws against panhandling, loitering or sleeping in public places, public intoxication, or possession of shopping carts. Some cities have instituted aggressive policing strategies to remove homeless people from public spaces (Graser, 2000) . Efforts to displace street youth and homeless people rather than offer them any meaningful help might have negative effects on health and in fact increase high-risk behaviors such as survival sex and unsafe injection drug use practices (O'Grady and Greene, 2003; Wood, et al., 2004) .",

Fiscal disparities typically occur when an older central city with a significant number of high-poverty neighborhoods is surrounded by a ring of higher-income municipalities. The central city's primary revenue stream from property taxes is limited by a weak tax base, but at the same time the city is confronted by a high and rising demand for social services, some of which is driven by the downloading of 'unfunded mandates' by states onto central city municipalities (Drier, et al., 2001) . Meanwhile, the nearby ring communities have a strong property tax base and face a lower demand for social services, while at the same time its residents work in the central city and benefit from its economic activities and services (the socalled \"free-rider\" effect) (Orfield, 1998; Drier, et al., 2001) . These fiscal disparities greatly exacerbate the adverse effects of racial and economic segregation on homeless people and others living in extreme poverty in the central city.",

Enacted in 1971 by the Minnesota legislature, the plan pools 40% of the increase in all communities' commercial/industrial property valuation. All cities and townships keep their pre-1971 tax bases plus 60% of the annual growth. The pool is then taxed at a uniform rate and redistributed among all local government entities. Although this redresses some of the intrametropolitan disparities, it does little to reduce the payoffs of \"externalizing\" social problems with tools like exclusionary zoning in typically more affluent communities. Moreover, the Minneapolis-St. Paul example depends on the existence of a strong regional-metropolitan level of governance, the Met Council, which although heavily studied (Orfield, 1998; Rusk, 1999; Katz and Bradley, 1999) , is still a concept that is strongly resisted by homeowners' associations, gated communities, and affluent municipalities (McKenzie, 1994; Boudreau and Keil, 2001 ). An alternative solution is to create cities that encompass lower and higher income areas, rather allowing them to separate into different jurisdictions. In Toronto, Ontario, this was effectively accomplished through the amalgamation of five contiguous cities into a single urban entity, although the amalgamation was motivated by a desire to increase operating efficiency rather than concern regarding fiscal disparities (Boudreau, 2000) .",

Homeless people, especially those who are chronically homeless, tend to have poor health. However, homelessness is a temporary state, not a permanent trait. As many as 8 millions Americans experience homelessness over a five year period, but most of these episodes of homelessness are quite brief (Link, et al., 1994) . Thus, at any single point in time only a very small proportion of a city's population is without a home. Homeless people would therefore be expected to have a minimal impact on indicators of overall population health, such as health status or mortality rates. Of course, this assumption may be incorrect in urban centers in the developing world, where extremely large numbers of people often live on the street or in encampments. Some have suggested that homelessness may have an adverse effect on public health through the spread of infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis. Compared to the general population, homeless people are clearly at increased risk of developing latent tuberculosis, which is not infectious to others, as well as active tuberculosis, which can infect those who come in close contact with the individual. During tuberculosis outbreaks, shelter residents, shelter staff, and health care providers are at increased risk of becoming infected (Advisory Council for the Elimination of Tuberculosis, 1992a). To date, however, outbreaks of tuberculosis among homeless people have not spread widely within the general population. The threat of tuberculosis is therefore an important health problem for homeless people, but one that has demonstrated relatively limited potential to affect overall population health in urban areas.",

The 2003 SARS outbreak in Toronto was almost entirely confined to travelers returning from abroad, health care workers, and their household contacts (Svoboda, et al., 2004) . No homeless person became infected with SARS. If this had happened, the large, transient, and difficult-to-locate shelter population would have made it almost impossible for Toronto public health officials to implement their core strategy of identifying and quarantining all \"household contacts\" of patients with SARS. Such a situation could have had devastating effects on efforts to prevent the outbreak from spreading into the city's general population. Given the threat of a recurrence of SARS or the possible emergence of other new and potentially deadly respiratory infections, infection control measures to deal with a severe acute infectious disease outbreak in the homeless population require serious consideration. Although this scenario is currently hypothetical, the potential implications for population health are considerable.",

Emphasis on the direct impact of homelessness on population health may be misplaced. Instead, homelessness may be viewed as a sentinel event, a marker for dysfunction in multiple sectors including the housing market, job market, health care system, and social welfare system. Homelessness represents the extreme end of a larger distribution of socioeconomic status and housing status, and it attracts attention precisely because of its dire nature. This conceptualization has been well-described in work by Rose (1985) . As shown in Figure 1 , the curve shown with a solid line represents the distribution of housing quality within a hypothetical population. Homelessness represents the extreme low point along the dimension of housing quality. This approach views one's housing situation as a continuum and avoids creating a simple dichotomy between being homeless and being housed. For the sake of this discussion, we assume that housing conditions have an impact on health, an assertion for which there is ample support (Fuller-Thomson, et al., 2000; Krieger and Higgins, 2002) . Figure 1 also illustrates two different approaches to improving health through improving housing conditions. The greatest effect in terms of population health may be gained through approach A (shifting the entire population distribution for the factor upwards slightly, to the distribution curve indicated by a dotted line) rather than approach B (focusing on improving conditions for the highest-risk group at the worst extreme of the distribution). A similar argument could be applied to the relationship between poverty and health, where the x-axis on the diagram would represent income rather than housing quality.",

Although this is a disturbingly high rate, the prevalence of asthma is also very high among inner-city children living in substandard housing (Malveaux and Fletcher-Vincent, 1995) . Because homeless children represent a relatively small proportion of all children living in poverty in a given city, the population health effect of asthma among homeless children is likely to be far smaller than the population health effect of asthma in the much larger number of children who are housed but living in decrepit buildings. While homeless children are a distressing manifestation of urban poverty, they represent \"the tip of the iceberg\" of the broader issue of poverty and poor housing. Thus, the problem of asthma among homeless children may be regarded as an extreme example of a much larger population health concern that may be a more appropriate target for intervention.",

Of course, this is not an either/or proposition. Nonetheless, an excessive emphasis on the latter approach might result in producing healthier homeless people, yet fail to recognize that homelessness is the result not only of individual vulnerabilities, but also of deeper structural problems within our society. On the other hand, a focus on the former approach may founder on the assumption that providing homeless people with stable housing will necessarily improve their health. An example of this tension is the emergence of two contrasting service delivery models to meet the needs of chronically homeless adults with concurrent mental illness and substance abuse (Tsemberis, et al., 2004; Hopper and Barrow, 2003 first model, known as the \"Continuum of Care,\" attempts to move homeless people from the street into transitional congregate housing, in conjunction with a requirement that the individual engage in treatment for their mental illness and addictions. Under this model, the person is allowed to make the transition to permanent housing only after they achieve abstinence from alcohol and drugs and their clinical status has been stabilized. In contrast, the \"Housing First\" model is based on the belief that homeless people should be afforded permanent housing as a basic human right, not as a reward contingent on participating in treatment. In this model, homeless people can obtain housing in individual apartments without any preconditions, and they are then offered an array of harm reduction and treatment services through an ACT team (see section 3.5. above). A recent randomized controlled trial assigned 225 homeless adults with concurrent severe mental illness and substance abuse to one of these two approaches. Individuals treated under the \"Housing First\" model spent significantly less time homeless over the follow-up period, and at the end of 24 months about 80% were in stable housing as compared to only 30% in the \"Continuum of Care\" model. However, there were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of alcohol use, drug use, or psychiatric symptoms. This study highlights the need to acknowledge that ending homelessness is a worthwhile goal in and of itself, but that it is not synonymous with improving the health of homeless people.",

As discussed in Section 3.5 above, a cornerstone of this effort is the use of multidisciplinary teams providing coordinated care at outreach sites, in combination with more traditional clinic-based health care services. For homeless people with severe mental illness, the availability of ACT services is vital, but the effectiveness of less resource-intensive systems of mental health care for homeless people needs to be assessed. For those with addictions, the availability of detoxification beds, postdetoxification stabilization programs, and longer-term (6 to 12 month) residential addiction treatment programs are important issues. In designing these services, the heterogeneous needs of different subgroups of homeless people (e.g., street youth, single men, single women, and mothers with young children) must be taken into account.",

Certainly, the availability of adequate capacity to accommodate everyone who seeks a shelter bed is a reasonable first step towards protecting homeless adults from the elements. Adherence to basic standards of cleanliness, nutrition, and food hygiene within shelters and the avoidance of overcrowding and inadequate ventilation are mandatory. Perhaps equally important is the creation of a safe and welcoming environment that encourages clients to engage with service providers.",

These efforts may at least in some cases have health benefits as well. For homeless families, there is compelling evidence that the provision of subsidized housing is both necessary and sufficient to end their homelessness (Shinn, et al., 1998) . The \"Housing First\" strategy appears to be more effective in moving homeless people with concurrent mental illness and substance abuse into stable housing; further research is needed to examine the effectiveness of this approach with other subgroups of homeless people.",

While the adverse health effects of homelessness are clearly severe, this phenomenon is only a specific and extreme example of the larger problem of the effects of poverty and inadequate housing on population health.",
