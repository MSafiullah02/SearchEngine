These decisions however should be made locally, based on COVID-19 burden and in the context of medical, logistical, and organizational considerations. There are different levels of urgency related to patient needs, and judgment is required to discern between them. However, as the numbers of COVID-19 patients requiring care is expected to escalate over the next few weeks, the surgical care of patients should be limited to those whose needs are imminently life threatening. These may include patients with malignancy that could progress or with active symptoms that require urgent care. All others should be delayed until after the peak of the pandemic is seen. This minimizes the risk to both patient and health care team, as well as minimizes utilization of necessary resources, such as beds, ventilators, and personal protective equipment (PPE).All non-essential hospital or office staff should be allowed to stay home and telework. All in-person educational sessions should be cancelled and could be replaced by online resources. The minimum number of necessary providers should attend patients during rounds and other encounters. Adherence to hand washing, antiseptic foaming, and appropriate use of PPE should be strictly enforced. When necessary, in-person surgical consultation should be performed by decision makers only.All non-urgent in-person clinic/office visits should be cancelled or postponed, unless needed to triage active symptoms or manage wound care. All patient visits should be handled remotely when possible, and in person only when absolutely necessary. Access to clinics should be maintained for those special circumstances to avoid patients seeking care in the Emergency Department (ED). Only a minimum of required support personnel should be present for these visits, and PPE should again be appropriately utilized. When in critical need, consideration should be given to redeploying OR resources for intensive care needs.Multidisciplinary team (MDT) meetings should be held virtually as possible and/or limited to core team members only, including surgeon, pathologist, Clinical Nurse Specialist, radiologist, oncologist, and coordinator. The MDT is responsible for the decision making and classifying the patient\u2019s priority level of need for surgery.\n",

            "text": "\nThere is very little evidence regarding the relative risks of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) versus the conventional open approach, specific to COVID-19. We will therefore continue to monitor emerging evidence and support novel research to address these issues.It is strongly recommended, however, that consideration be given to the possibility of viral contamination to staff during open, laparoscopic, or robotic surgery and that protective measures are strictly employed for OR staff safety and to maintain a functioning workforce.Although previous research has shown that laparoscopy can lead to aerosolization of blood borne viruses, [1\u20133] there is no evidence to indicate that this effect is seen with COVID-19, nor that it would be isolated to MIS procedures. Nevertheless, erring on the side of safety would warrant treating the coronavirus as exhibiting similar aerosolization properties. For MIS procedures, use of devices to filter released CO2 for aerosolized particles should be strongly considered.Proven benefits of MIS of reduced length of stay and complications [4\u20137] should be strongly considered in these patients, in addition to the potential for ultrafiltration of the majority of aerosolized particles. Filtration of aerosolized particles may be more difficult during open surgery [8, 9].There may also be enhanced risk of viral exposure to proceduralists/endoscopists from endoscopy and airway procedures. When these procedures are necessary, strict use of PPE should be considered for the whole team, following Centers for Disease Control (CDC, https://www.cdc.gov) or WHO (https://www.who.int) guidelines for droplet or airborne precautions. The PPE should include, at a minimum, N95 masks and face shields [10, 11].\n",

These recommendations may be modified by local hospital policy, as necessary. Appropriate gowns and face shields should be utilized. These measures should be used in all surgical procedures during the pandemic regardless of known or suspected COVID status. Placement and removal of PPE in should be done according to CDC guidelines (link to CDC https://www.cdc.gov [15])Electrosurgery units should be set to the lowest possible settings for the desired effect. Use of monopolar electrosurgery, ultrasonic dissectors, and advanced bipolar devices should be minimized, as these can lead to particle aerosolization [16\u201322], and if available, monopolar diathermy pencils with attached smoke evacuators should be used.Surgical equipment used during procedures with COVID-19-positive or person under investigation (PUI)/suspected COVID patients should be cleaned separately from other surgical equipment.\n",
