            "text": "In the framework of the centenary of the promulgation of the Political Constitution of the United Mexican States (1917), the current directions of Mexican Law of Religion are addressed. The starting point is the constitutional reform of January 28, 1992, to Articles 3, 5, 24, 27, and 130, which are the basis for the development of a Law of Religion in a positive sense. This reform contains the principles that guarantee the freedom of religion in Mexico: separation between State and churches and Laicity of State. \"Mexican Law of Religion\" means the totality of state legal norms that include the religious factor linked to individual, corporate, and collective religious needs and interests under the fundamental principles of religious freedom, secularism (laicity), and separation of the State and religious communities. In this sense, the holders of the religious factor are not only the individual person and the religious communities or religious associations but also the indigenous peoples. For the analysis, I will focus my remarks on some fundamental topics: the amendments to Articles 24 and 40 of the Political Constitution and the New Constitution of Mexico City; development and legal protection of the dimensions of religious freedom; management of religious diversity as public policy and recent cases, such as the Native American Church case and the Blood Transfusion case, since these illustrate the Supreme Court's readiness to protect the right of religious freedom. One of the most difficult issues to resolve with respect to the register of religious associations has been how to define \"notorio arraigo.\" The Basic Law strives to protect religious freedom and to establish a society tolerant of religious difference. Furthermore, increased protection of religious minorities may signal a change in Mexican cultural perceptions of religious minorities.",

            "text": "In particular, Article 130 (today, Principle of Separation of State and churches) allowed the churches and religious communities to acquire legal personality once they obtained their registration as religious associations by the Ministry of Interior. Now, the last constitutional reform to Article 24 on July 19, 2013, implied the substitution of the expression \"every man\" for \"every person,\" the introduction of the right to freedom of ethical convictions, conscience, and religion. It makes clear that this freedom includes the right to participate individually or collectively, both in 1 It is worth noting that the concept of \"Mexican ecclesiastical law\" is formally limited, because it refers to the ecclesiastical, to the institutional, to the churches, but not all religious communities are erected in this way, as churches; for example, the case of Jewish, Buddhist, Hindu communities. For that reason, among others, I prefer to refer to the \"Mexican Law of Religion\" as the set of rules of the State concerning the religious factor that attends to the religious needs and interests at the individual level (individual juridical person), corporate level (religious communities and religious associations), and collective level (indigenous peoples, with respect to their religious practices and customs), under the principles of religious freedom, laicity (laicidad), and separation of state and churches (or religious communities). Under Mexican law of religion is to be understood the \"totality of state juridical norms, which regulate the religious factor related to religious needs and interests of its holders at the individual level, the corporative level (religious communities and religious associations) and the collective level (indigenous people, in the case of their religious usages and customs), and under the fundamental principles: laicity of the State, religious freedom and separation between State and religious communities\" (Medina Gonz\u00e1lez 2005). public and in private, in ceremonies, devotions or acts of worship, provided they do not constitute an offense punishable by law. Although a prohibition is incorporated: \"No one can use the public acts of expression of this freedom for political purposes, proselytism or propaganda.\" Before this reform, several civil and non-Catholic religious associations demonstrated in about 20 states in the Mexican Republic to warn that they would not allow the reform of Article 24 of the Constitution, because it threatens the secular nature of the Mexican State and it gives privileges for Catholics. They expressed three arguments: (I) The intention of the reform is the dismantling of the secular state. It is intended to use it to demand clerical privileges: mainly replacement of secular education for religious instruction in public schools and control of mass media. (II) The handling of the reform in the concept of \"freedom of religion.\" The redefinition of \"freedom of religion\" that the Catholic hierarchy seeks to establish offers a tendentious and biased concept of that freedom to provide religious education in public schools as a religious privilege. (III) The consequences of reform are an affectation of the freedoms of religious minorities. For example, religious education in public schools will cause that children and adolescents who profess a different faith then Catholic become victims of acts of intolerance and discrimination. Religion is also represented as a factor of division among students professing different faiths and as an element of social polarization that will damage seriously the living together.",

Laicity and religious freedom are not opposed and are not mutually excluded. Reference to an \"open laicity,\" \"positive laicity,\" or even \"healthy laicity\" is made. For example, religious freedom includes the teaching of religion too, and the state has to guarantee it. The current dimension of laicity is particularly in the field of cultural identities and protection of minorities. The issue of laicity is not only \"political\" but also related to the \"minorities,\" who defend their \"vulnerability.\" The concept of the secular (lay = laico) state is dynamic, and is linked to social processes. In the debate on laicity are present new actors, and not only the traditional State-church or churches but also women, academics, homosexuals, and indigenous people. Certainly, the \"pathology\" of laicity would be to reduce religion to the private sphere alone. The formula \"for greater religious freedom\" less \"lay state\" is a fallacy.",

This consideration has its own specific weight to the topic at hand, since to democratize society within a framework of laicity (laicidad) is to allow multiculturalism to be expressed through religious freedom.
