The tumor was discovered on a chest CT scan at an outside hospital. She had a medical history of hypertension for 30 years and type II diabetes. On day 6 of hospitalization, an enhanced chest CT scan was performed that confirmed an irregular solid nodule in the right middle lobe and bilateral ground-glass opacity (GGO). At that time, the significance of the latter findings was unknown. Her general condition was good, with no fever or respiratory symptoms, and with clear lung sounds on auscultation bilaterally. She underwent presurgical tests and preparations. On day 12, a thoracoscopic resection of the right middle lobe was performed without event. On day 13 (postoperative day 1), a repeat CT scan revealed postresection changes and bilateral GGO in the lower lobes of the lungs (Fig. 1A) . White blood cell (WBC) count was 12.49 \u00c2 10 12 /liter, whereas lymphocyte count decreased to 0.4 \u00c2 10 9 /liter and the differential to 5%. There was a slight wheezing sound on auscultation on the right side. On day 16, the patient experienced some difficulty in breathing, chest tightness, wheezing, and dry cough. She received a diagnosis \"suggestive of viral pneumonia,\" with intermittent peripheral capillary oxygen saturation between 72% and 88%. On day 24, she was transferred to a special isolation ward owing to a pharyngeal swab test result that was positive for the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Laboratory specimens drawn on the previous day (day 23) revealed the following: increased WBC count to 33.52 \u00c2 10 9 /liter; increased neutrophils to 89.80%; decreased lymphocytes to 1.90%; decreased eosinophils to 0%; increased neutrophil count to 30.10 \u00c2 10 9 /liter; decreased lymphocyte count to 0.65 \u00c2 10 9 /liter; increased monocyte count to 2.50 \u00c2 10 9 /liter; decreased eosinophil count to 0.01 \u00c2 10 9 /liter; and increased basophil count to 0.26 \u00c2 10 9 /liter. Despite comprehensive treatment, including antibiotics, assisted oxygenation, and other supportive care, the patient's condition deteriorated. Her peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) decreased to 62.6% and heart rate to 40 bpm. A do-not-resuscitate order was given. She went into coma on day 27 and died on day 29. She did not manifest fever during the hospital stay.",

A nucleic acid test for 2019-nCoV came back positive. Other laboratory specimens were significant for decreased lymphocyte count. He was readmitted to the infectious disease ward. A repeat chest CT scan revealed additional foci of GGO in the bilateral upper lobes, consistent with viral pneumonia (Fig. 1B, case 2) . Tests for influenza virus and other infectious agents were negative. He underwent treatment for novel coronavirus pneumonia.

Therefore, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses recently renamed the 2019-nCoV to SARS-CoV-2 and the disease as COVID-19. Compared with pathologic findings in a cohort of autopsy cases of SARS, the two cases presented here also exhibited exudative and proliferative phases of acute lung injury, such as edema, inflammatory infiltrate, type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, and organization, but without obvious hyaline membrane formation and other long-term processes, such as squamous metaplasia. [4] [5] [6] Of note, the pathologic changes seen in our two cases preceded the development of clinical symptoms and likely represent an earlier phase of the disease. Future studies of autopsies may add to the current findings.",

            "text": "Although case 1 patient was never febrile, her complete blood count profile, especially from postoperative day 1, revealed high WBC counts and lymphocytopenia, which is consistent with COVID-19. This may be a good clue for early diagnosis in the future. Case 2 developed a fever a few days after the CT findings, suggesting a delay in symptom development in these patients. During the earlier days of the outbreak, there had been limitations in both capacity and turnaround time for the nucleic acid test, which had further caused delay in confirming the diagnosis of COVID-19 7 in many patients. It seems that the time for the early lung lesions or COVID-19 to become severe enough to cause clinical symptoms is rather long. Even among patients with fever, the typically used pharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction test may be negative, owing to the absence of viruses in the upper respiratory tract despite the presence of pneumonia. However, radiographic changes can occur early (chest CT scan is mostly employed in the People's Republic of China during the current outbreak). Therefore, during an epidemic season, it is prudent to carefully evaluate any lung infiltration for GGO, and an appropriate serology test must be performed to rule out potential infection. 7 These two incidents also typify a common scenario during the earlier phase of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, during which a significant number of health care providers became infected in hospitals in Wuhan, and patients in a same room were cross-infected, as they were exposed to unknown transmission sources. Because of this, it is important to practice \"universal precaution\" in surgical pathology laboratories and regard all fresh specimens as potentially infectious. In the People's Republic of China, most surgical specimens are received already fixed in formalin. However, for larger specimens, the center of a specimen may not be sufficiently fixed and still pose potential risk for infection. Therefore, proper personal protective equipment with surgical masks or N95 respirators is worn all the time in the gross room. Fortunately, thus far, to our knowledge, no cases of pathologists being infected by COVID-19 had occurred.",
