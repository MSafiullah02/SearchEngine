Type I IFNs are important against PRRSV infection (Albina et al., 1998, Overend et al., 2007). However, PRRSV was found to be a poor IFN-inducer as compared with porcine respiratory coronavirus (Buddaert et al., 1998).",

IRF3 and NF-\u03baB are also activated by post-translational modification (Honda and Taniguchi, 2006). A number of viruses develop different mechanisms to inhibit expression of IFNs or antagonize their actions (Goodbourn et al., 2000, Miller et al., 2004). The immediate early protein ORF62 of Varicella-zoster virus blocks IRF3 phosphorylation to disarm the IFN-dependent antiviral defense (Sen et al., 2010), while its ORF61 protein antagonizes the IFN-\u03b2 pathway by degrading IRF3 (Zhu et al., 2011). PRRSV NSP1 was found to strongly inhibit phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF3 induced by dsRNA or Sendai virus (Beura et al., 2010). Others suggested that PRRSV NSP1 did not appear to modify IRF3 phosphorylation or to prevent its nuclear translocation, but rather to block its full activation with subsequent inhibition of assembly of the IFN enhancers through degrading histone acetyltransferase nuclear protein CBP in the nucleus (Eksioglu et al., 2011, Kim et al., 2010). Therefore, definite mechanisms by which PRRSV inhibits expression of IFN-\u03b2 are poorly understood. Given the apparent contradictory results regarding the role of PRRSV in evading IRF3-mediated responses, we assessed the effects and patterns of PRRSV on IFN-\u03b2 expression and IRF3 activation over an extended period of time in MARC-145 cells treated with poly(I:C).",

We did not find significant IFN-\u03b2 expression in virus infected cells throughout the infection period, which was in sharp contrast with marked increase of IFN-\u03b2 transcription in poly (I:C) stimulated cells (Fig. 1\n), suggesting that PRRSV did not seem to initiate PRR signaling in MARC-145 cells. The virus also did not activate IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity as revealed by the dual luciferase assay (Promega) (data not shown). The 5\u2032 end of the PRRSV genome is reported to be methyl-capped (Sagripanti et al., 1986, Yoo et al., 2004). Similar to coronavirus (Zust et al., 2011) or dengue virus (Rodriguez-Madoz et al., 2010), PRRSV might hide or modify their 5\u2032-RNA structures to escape from innate immune recognition such as by RNA capping. Another possibility could be that PRRSV might be able to induce IFN-I signaling in infected cells via its dsRNA replication intermediate, but could be inhibited by its nonstructural or structural proteins produced during infection. This has been seen with hepatitis C virus (Cheng et al., 2006). However, the mechanisms by which PRRSV deploys for evasion, though extensively studied in recently years, remain to be determined.",

IRF3 was examined because it is a key cellular transcription factor in the type I IFN pathway (Iwamura et al., 2001). IRF3 usually retains in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells. Upon stimulation of the cells, such as infection by viruses, it is phosphorylated (Panne et al., 2007b, Yoneyama et al., 2004), dimerized and translocates to the nuclei where it forms complex with CBP/p300 (Panne et al., 2007a, Wathelet et al., 1998). Such nuclear recruitment promotes histone acetylation and changes chromatin architecture that are permissive to transcriptional activation (Sharma and Nyborg, 2008). Although our results were in general agreement with several previous reports that PRRSV was inhibitory to poly(I:C)-induced IFN-I signaling (Kim et al., 2010, Luo et al., 2008), we found that PRRSV exhibited different patterns of inhibition: significant inhibition of IFN-\u03b2 gene transcription seen as early as 12 hpi, marked down-regulation of IRF3 phosphorylation from 48 hpi. Such inhibition became more pronounced with the progression of viral infection up to 60 h (Fig. 3\nA and B). Moreover, suppression of IRF3 phosphorylation or its nuclear translocation was still partial at 60 hpi (Fig. 3C\u2013E). The different patterns of inhibition for IFN-\u03b2 transcription and IRF3 phosphorylation have important implications as to the mechanism(s) by which PRRSV suppresses the type I IFN signaling at early stage of infection (e.g. within 24 h). There should be mechanism(s) other than effecting on IRF3 or molecules upstream. It may do so either through degradation of CBP (Han et al., 2012, Kim et al., 2010), or by decreased IRF3 nuclear translocation (Beura et al., 2010), or possibly by direct blocking of IRF3 binding to the IFN-\u03b2 promoter region within the nucleus which is yet to be studied in the future.",
