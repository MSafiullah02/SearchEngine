About 80% of total collected 154 samples from both urban (three houses; U1, U2 and U3) and rural sites (two houses; R1 and R2) were 155 used for cell culture exposure and data reported for cytotoxic effect is an average values of total samples 156 analyzed at each site. Preparation of A549 cells (lung epithelial cell line) were detailed out in 157 supplementary file. A549 cells were exposed to collected PM samples and a constant dose (10^6 158 microbes/ml) of microorganisms for 24 hr and assayed in three technical and biological replicates. Cells 159 with media acted as a positive control. Briefly, cells were incubated with PM samples and microbial 160 species for 24 hr and after that 20 \u00b5l of MTT solution was added and further incubated the mixture for 4 161 hr followed by centrifugation. Media was removed after 24 hr of exposure and subsequently 100 \u00b5l of 162 DMSO was added and finally absorbance was measured at 570 nm by spectrophotometer well plate 163 reader (PerkinElmer EnSpire 2300). Pathways involved in the cell death (in tems of appoptosis and 164 necrosis) on exposure to adequate microbial pathogens can be monitored by widely used 165 phosphatidylserine staining detection method i.e., Annexin PI. Appoptosis is a carefully regulated process 166 of programmed cell death whereas necrosis occurs through differences in plasma membrane integrity and 167 permeability. In present study, cell death on expossure to airborne microbiota was employed by using 168 the Alexa Fluor 488 annexin 5/Dead Cell apoptosis kit with Alexa Fluor 488 annexin v and PI following 169 manufacturer instruction (briefly outlined in supplementary file). The data generated by flow cytometry 170 (Attune NxT Flow cytometer, Thermo Fisher Scientific) are plotted in two-dimensional dot plots in which 171 PI is represented versus Annexin V. These plots can be divided in four regions corresponding to live cells 172 (i.e. annexin V-/PI-), early apoptotic (i.e. annexin V+/PI-), late apoptotic (i.e. annexin V+/PI+) and 173 necrotic (i.e. annexin V-/PI+.) 174",

Significant 392 negative correlation has been found between A549 cell viability and microbial (r= -0.74 for urban 393 bacteria, r = -0.69 for rural bacteria; r = -0.77 for urban fungi, r = -0.84 for rural fungi) and endotoxin 394 concentration (r = -0.73 for urban, r = -0.69 for rural) clearly demonstrating the influence of these 395 airborne microbiata and their components in causing the cell death. Further, interaction between 396 individual microbial species abundantly found in indoor air and A549 cells were also evaluated. On 397 exposure of A549 to predominant airborne microbes, significant decrease in cell viability with respect to 398 control was observed. Fungal species induced higher cytotoxic response as compared to the bacterial cells 399 (Fig. 3b) and treated cells appeared to be non-viable with considerable detachment and other 400 morphological changes (Fig. 3b) . All together, maximum cell death was observed (65%) by Aspergillus 401 sp. probably due to their ability to produce secondary metabolites which can be responsible for causing 402 cytotoxic effects (Aiko and Mehta, 2015) and Mucor was found to be least cytotoxic in nature.

Quantitative analysis revealed that the level of total culturable 213 bacteria (TCB) associated with PM 10 at urban houses varied from 323 to 3231 CFU/m 3 with an average 214 value of 2136 \u00b1 285 CFU/m 3 whereas the concentration of PM 2.5 bound bacteria was found to be in the 215 range of 246 to 2303 with mean value of 1605 \u00b1 239 CFU/m 3 . Average CFU count of gram negative 216 bacteria (GNB) associated with PM 10 and PM 2.5 was observed to be 1213 \u00b1 224 and 899 \u00b1 221 CFU/m 3 217 respectively which is higher in comparison with the CFU count of gram positive bacteria (GPB) (PM 10 -218 923 \u00b1 181 CFU/m 3 and PM 2.5 -706 \u00b1 195 CFU/m 3 ) at urban environment(Table S3a). Average 219 concentration of fungal fraction associated with PM 10 and PM 2.5 was observed as 1484 \u00b1 301 and 1279 \u00b1 220 280 CFU/m 3 , respectively. High bacterial concentration found at urban houses is probably attributed to 221 the human activities such as talking, sneezing, coughing, and their other constant actions. Degradation of 222 wastes carried out in the dump yard located near the urban houses (Fig. S1) provides a good platform for 223 bacterial growth (Balyan et al., 2017; Kumar et al., 2013). In addition, indoor plants and pets present in 224 urban houses are also traced to be the probable fungi and bacteria emitting sources (Pussian amd Marr, 225 2015; Yassin and Almouqatea, 2010). 226 Level of total culturable bacteria (TCB) associated with PM 10 and PM 2.5 found in rural environments was 227 exhibited as 1521 \u00b1 206 and 1306 \u00b1 163 CFU/m 3 respectively. In rural houses, average concentration of 228 gram positive bacteria associated with both sized PM was found to be higher with an average value of 829 229 \u00b1 205 CFU/m 3 (PM 10 ) and 701 \u00b1 201 CFU/m 3 (PM 2.5 ) in comparison with the CFU count of GNB. 230 Concentration of fungal fraction was exhibited the dominance in both PM 10 and PM 2.5 with mean value of 231 1794 \u00b1 302 and 1593 \u00b1 300 CFU/m 3 respectively (S3 a). Rural houses in present study are comparatively 232 heavily crowded with 5-6 peoples of different age group, health and gender. Therefore, constant human 233 8 activities of different background people and their activities like burning of oil lamps and incense can 234 cause bacterial emissions (Agarwal et al., 2016). In present study, higher fungal load has been observed in 235 rural houses probably attributed to the outdoor fungal sources such as agricultural activities and cattle 236 sheds (Fig. S1) in close proximity of this site (Kalisa et al., 2019). Natural ventilation in rural houses is 237 driven by prevailing wind flow through open windows and doors leading to higher air exchange rate and 238 therefore more penetration of air from outdoor to indoor may increase in indoor fungal concentration. In 239 addition, air exchange between outdoor and indoor environment i.e., infiltration can also occur through 240 cracks and leaks present in the rural households (Leung, 2015). Previous studies have also reported higher 241 fungal growth in rural environments which is in accordance with present results (Bragoszewska et al., 242 2016; Canha et al., 2015; Nasir et al., 2013). 243",

Similarly, low temperature decrease cell membrane fluidity which 255 further inhibits the microbial activity; therefore the increased atmospheric temperature promotes the 256 growth and release of microbes (Bragoszewska et al., 2017). 257 Due to the absence of epidemiologically established dose-response relationship of most of the microbial 258 agent and diversity between individuals in the response to a particular inhaled microbe, there are no 259 threshold health based reference values concerning the concentration of microorganisms in residential 260 indoor settings. Therefore, data obtained in present study was compared with guidelines provided by 261 some organizations (CEC, WHO, OSHA, ACGIH, OISH, CHMC and CIC) and as well as with other 262 studies performed in indoor environment in India (Chennai, Vishakhapatnam, Delhi) and worldwide 263 (Ethiopia, Egypt, Nigeria and Iran). Microbial concentration in present study was above the threshold 264 values prescribed by these organizations (Table -S4) and according to the sanitary standard of European 265 commission for non-industrial premises (CEC, 1993), these values are considered to be heavily 266 contaminated in terms of bacterial (500-2000 CFU/m 3 ) and fungal (500-2000 CFU/m 3 ) pollution.

During summer season, degree 278 of decomposition of waste in dump yard located near the urban site occurs at a faster rate which 279 eventually causes higher emission of bacteria in urban houses. Predominance of bacterial aerosol in 280 summer season was also reported by Sivasakthivel and Nandini, 2017. In case of rural households, during 281 summer season windows and doors are usually kept open which results in higher penetration of outdoor 282 air resulting in higher fungal growth in the environment. In addition, elevated temperature in summer 283 season also provides appropriate conditions for the germination, growth and propagation of airborne fungi 284 (Xie et al., 2018). The concentration of bacteria and fungi in monsoon season remains least at both urban 285 and rural sites due to rain wash effect and similar observation has been reported by other studies (Lal et 286 al., 2017; Blazewic et al., 2014).",

Among 7 identified species of 307 airborne fungi (Aspergillus sp., Cladosporium sp., Penicillium sp., Alternaria alternata, Fusarium sp., 308 Trichoderma sp. and Mucor), Aspergillus sp. was found to be predominant in both sized PM collected 309 from urban and rural households. Abundance of Aspergillus species may trigger hypersensitivity 310 pneumonitis to the exposed occupants as these species are well-known to play a role in three different 311 clinical settings in humans: opportunistic infections, allergic states and toxicoses by inhalation (Marta 312 Ma\u0142ecka-Adamowicz et al., 2019; Egbuta et al., 2017). In addition, other recognized fungal species such 313 as Penicillium sp, Alternaria alternata and Cladosporium sp have the ability to cause severe episodes of 314 pneumonitis, asthma and rhinitis respectively which can also be a threat for the residents (Agarwal et al., 315 2016; Priyamvada et al., 2017).

Internationally accepted threshold limit of endotoxin 337 exposure indicating the safe level for humans has yet not been established. Although the National Health 338 Council of the Netherlands has prescribed the threshold limit of 90 EU/m 3 for endotoxin exposure, but 339 various scholars have suggested that endotoxin level in residential premises ranging from 0.02 to 19.5 340 EU/m 3 could have played significant role in causing sick building symptoms (Roque et al., 2018; Park et 341 al., 2008).

Oxidation of DTT can be measured 350 by examining the rate of DTT loss in presence of redox active components (microbial cells) and can be 351 used as a measure of oxidative potential. Intrinsic higher DTT activity (in terms of DTT loss) with respect 352 to control has been observed for both sized PM samples collected from urban and rural households clearly 353 demonstrating their oxidative nature. DTT depletion from blank samples was also measured and no 354 difference was found as compared to control. Generally, the identification of specific components of PM 355 as a contributor to DTT loss is based on the correlation of DTT activity with PM composition. Therefore 356 in present study, in order to identify the role of bacterial and fungal aerosols towards DTT loss, 357 correlation between CFU count of bacterial and fungal composition in both sites and DTT loss in PM 358 samples were calculated in terms of Pearson's coefficient(Table S6). Significant positive correlation has 359 been observed between DTT loss and microbial concentration in urban (r = 0.63 for bacteria and 0.67 for 360 fungi) and rural (r = 0.6 for bacteria and 0.7 for fungi) houses, clearly supporting the influence of these 361 microbial components of PM on DTT loss. In addition, all of the individual microbes (cultivated from PM 362 extract) predominantly found in indoor air exhibited considerable DTT depletion as compared to the 363 control also suggesting their significant oxidative potential. Fungal isolates have induced higher depletion 364 of DTT in comparison with bacterial cells and amongst all, Aspergillus sp. showed maximum oxidative 365 reactivity followed by Cladosporium sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Fusarium sp. etc. Elevated 366 oxidative potential of Aspergillious species was also previously reported by other studies (Samke et al., 367 2017; Madsen et al., 2012; Timm et al., 2009) Functional groups present in the cell walls of these 368 microbes can involve in DTT dehydrogenation in terms of redox activity and leading to imbalances in 369 redox cycling and the production of high levels of ROS (Samke et al., 2017).

Commonly cell death involves two primary pathways: apoptosis and necrosis(Turner et al., 2015). In 407 present study, Annexin V assay differentiate between apoptosis and necrosis pathways relating to cell 408death induced by gram positive (S. aureus), gram negative bacterial (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and 409 fungal (Aspergillus sp.) species dominantly found in indoor environments and depicted in Fig. 4. Present 410 findings demonstrated the significant potential of all three chosen airborne microbes to persuade cell 411 death in terms of both necrosis and apoptosis. With respect to the control, percentage cell death has been 412 considerably increased for both bacterial and fungal pathogens. Aspergillus sp. exhibited maximum 413 percentage of necrotic cell death (50.3%) amongst all analysed microbes. Gram negative bacteria 414 (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) induced 31.5% of necrotic (annexin V-/PI+.)) and 16% of late apoptotic 415 (annexin V+/PI+) cell death where as gram positive bacteria (S. aureus) induced 43.6% necrotic and 29% 416 of late apoptotic cell death. Necrosis is considered as a post apoptotic event in which necrotic cells are 417 associated with both apoptotic (DNA fragmentation) and necrotic features (rupture of cytoplasmic 418 membrane) and pathogenic consequence of persistent apoptotic-necrosis is the leakage of pro-419 inflammatory mediators leading to acute and chronic inflammation (Oliveria et al., 2015). ROS mediated 420 oxidative stress has comprehensive influence in induction of necrotic cell death (Hea et al., 2017; Choi et 421 al., 2009). Results of DTT assay already demonstrated the highly oxidative nature of Aspergillus sp. and 422 Pseudomonas aeruginosa which can be considered as an imperative factor of causing significant necrotic 423 cell death. Findings from present study established that the cytotoxicity initiated in A549 cells by both 424 bacterial and fungal pathogens can lead to both types of cell death; however, necrosis appeared to be the 425 dominant pathway. 426",

TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6 are believed to be the main mediators of host response 439 towards infectious organisms and higher level of these modulators are reported in response to viral infections, 440 and allergic rhinitis (Skovbjerg et al., 2010; Purokivi et al., 2002) . In present study, predominantly found gram 441 positive (S. aureus), gram negative bacterial (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and fungal (Aspergillus sp.) species 442 associated with PM were subjected to the production of inflammatory cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, 443 IL-10, IL-12, TNF-\u03b1) in alveolar epithelial cells and the results revealed the significant production of all these 444 cytokines as compared to the corresponding unexposed controls (Fig.3.5 ). Considerable production of 445 cytokines by these airborne microbes probably is associated with their higher oxidative potential (Viegas et al., 446 2017) . Pseudomonas aeruginosa induced maximum production of IL-5, IL-6 and IL-10 and maximum 447 production of other cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-12, IL-2, IL-9) has been triggered by Aspergillus sp. In addition, 448 prominent production of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 as compared to control has been also observed on interaction of 449 chosen microbial with lung macrophages (Fig. 6 ). Significant increase in the expression of representative 450 inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1) clearly indicates acute and short inflammatory response of these 451 airborne microbes of PM. The levels of TNF-\u03b1, secreted into the culture medium were highest in GPB treated 452 macrophages whereas, expression of IL-6 was found to be maximum for GNB and Aspergillus sp. treated 453 macrophages.
