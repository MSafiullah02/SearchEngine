Alongside, the crisis 5 provokes impetus for overdue change to educational and training methods that have stood their 6 ground since the birth of hospital medicine: lectures, workshops and conferences. 1 The spread 7 of coronavirus has left thousands of medical students stranded. All specialist training ventures 8 are deferred. Educational and clinical meetings have been cancelled. 9 10 When what remains of our communities finally draws a post-Covid19 breath, specialties 11 including vascular surgery must seize upon value from measures taken by major industry. Apple 12 Inc (Cupertino, CA -USA) transformed its major annual conference, WWDC, into an online-13 only meeting. If this venture succeeds, it provides a template for online-only conferences in other 14 disciplines too. Should it not, we must learn from an analysis of why it failed to work. Providing 15 an online-only conference is a tall ask; Google LLC (Mountain View, CA -United States) 16 canceled theirs altogether. Delivering a fully online international conference is not a challenge to 17 be underestimated. 18 19 The impact of COVID-19upon routine clinical and administrative congregation has been abrupt, 20 overwhelming and unprecedented. Meetings of large groups within a closed environment, 21 commuting to and from academic institutions and physical presence at close quarters are all 22 proscribed now, to minimise the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The UK National Health Service, in 23 the words of Andy Cowper (HSJ), has seen more progressive change in a fortnight than has been 1 accomplished in years of stifled effort. The instigation of virtual outpatient encounters to replace 2 unjustifiably hazardous hospital attendances is one example. How then, should we translate these 3 developments into the domain of surgical education? 4 5 The infrastructure is already in place to provide exclusively online vascular surgical learning, 6 both synchronous and asynchronous. The European Society for Vascular Surgery (ESVS) has a 7 track record of providing both asynchronous eLearning for academic learning objectives 8 (blended learning modules and online courses, 2012-2016) as well as synchronous e-classes 9 (Masterclass 2019-2020). 2,3 Renowned vascular surgery conferences such as the annual Leipzig 10 Interventional Course (LINC) regularly broadcast operative interventions in real-time, 11 sandwiched into a full day's congress schedule -a remarkable feat of both organization and 12 technical expertise. Some manufacturers of medical devices (e.g. W. L. Gore & Associates, Inc. 13 Newark, DE -USA) have already released novel mobile applications to address the lack of on-14",
