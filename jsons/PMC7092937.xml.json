Docking of the two domains has been manually performed and the reliability of each of the possible peplomer assemblies has been discussed according to the ProsaII software package [11]. Accordingly, quaternary structures exhibiting the lowest energies for atom pair and solvent interaction were considered for further optimisation by using molecular dynamics simulations with Gromacs [12]. After a PROCHECK analysis of the final refined peplomer structure it has been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with the ID code 1T7G. All displays of structures, as well as exposed surface area (ESA) calculations, were carried out with the program MOLMOL [13].",

This is also in accord with the general rule that coronavirus spike proteins form three-stranded left-handed coiled-coils. Moreover, the fact that the 320\u2013518 fragment of S1 domain has been identified as the SARS-CoV peplomer binding site to the ACE2 cellular receptor [15] implies that the residues which are the most involved in the interaction with the receptor have to be positioned in the S1 external top side.",

From this starting point, to recompose the full SARS-CoV peplomer from its components, we used the following simple criteria: (i) orienting each S1 and the S2 stalk domains so that they could dock through the interaction described above, (ii) keeping all the potential N-glycosylation sites as surface exposed as possible, and (iii) positioning the largest hydrophobic surface patches in subunit interfaces. The fact that in the S2 trimer the side chains of L803 and F805 residues are still surface accessible after the coiled coil formation supports the hypothesis that the peplomer reaches its structural stability through the hydrophobic interactions of the S1 pocket with the S2 finger, as depicted in Fig. 2\n. Then, geometrical and energetic considerations converge towards possible solutions for the structure of the SARS-CoV peplomer. In Fig. 3\n, three molecules of S1\u2013S2 adducts are positioned after their assembly, in a way which is consistent with the overall size of the peplomer [8]. It should be noted also that, among the mutations which have been found in the SARS-CoV spike protein region of all the available genomes, see Table 2\n, nothing occurs in the S1\u2013S2 interfaces here identified.",

Such subdomain is critical for the interaction with the viral envelope, due to its proximity to the trans-membrane region and for the overall structure stability of the peplomer. In fact, a peptide reproducing the C terminal heptad repeat fragment 1161\u20131187 of S2 exhibits antiviral activity [20].",

Accordingly, the most interesting regions to be reproduced in synthetic peptides for mimotope design have been found, as well as the hydrophobic sites distributed at the S1/S1, S2/S2, and S1/S2 interfaces for targeting of potential antiviral drugs (patent RM2004A000162). The fact that we could not model the 665\u2013736 sequence of the S glycoprotein does not interfere with the exposed surface on top of the SARS-CoV peplomer, as the missing modelled moiety can be identified in a peplomer lateral region, where a deep groove is found. This peplomer region could be filled by the non-modelled part of the sequence, which consistently exhibits an extensive hydrophobic character [21]. In the present peplomer model, the so-called HR1 and HR2 moieties, i.e., the N and C terminal heptad repeat regions, respectively, spanning the sequences 904\u2013975 and 1148\u20131193, are not bound together. This feature is consistent with the extensive conformational change, necessary for this and several other viruses for the fusogenic mechanism [22], [23], [24].",

It can be observed that (i) most of the mutations are found in exposed sites; (ii) the only mutation involving a relevant position for the receptor interaction, i.e., 344 K/R, is a conservative one; and (iii) non-conservative substitutions are found in the buried positions of residue 778 with Y/D, which do not induce sterical conflicts.",

In fact, from the sequence alignment of the spike glycoproteins of all known coronaviruses, as shown in Table 1, it appears that the above-described hydrophobic interaction between the S1 pocket and the S2 finger is very conserved. It could, therefore, represent a very critical region for the interaction between S1 and S2 domains for all coronaviruses, opening new perspectives for the design of small molecules that can efficiently interfere with the viral replication. Hence, SARS as well as all the other members of the coronaviridae family could put down their infecting crown with the same type of antiviral drug, which could protect from possible transmission of coronavirus infections from wild animals.",
