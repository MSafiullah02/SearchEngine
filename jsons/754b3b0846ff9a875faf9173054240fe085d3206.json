Medicaid or other public insurance, as many dermatologists are not accepting these patients. 2 . In 10 addition, some states with substantial Medicaid expansion programs, such as New Mexico, were 11 recently reporting member care organizations below access standards in dermatology for both 12 rural and urban areas. 3 Virtual care has been identified as a strategy to ensure access to essential Teledermatology has improved access to dermatology services for many vulnerable populations; 33 yet it has been difficult to build sustainable, long-term programs given lack of widespread 34 reimbursement. We hope that new temporary changes will bring significant attention to the What will telemedicine look like post-COVID-19? A quote attributed to Mahatma Gandhi says, 40 \"The true measure of any society can be found in how it treats its most vulnerable members.\" 41 Likewise, whatever shape telemedicine takes in the future, we must leverage its power to expand 42 access to care to help those who need it most. Indeed, teledermatology is more than technology 43 and infrastructure -it is workflow, collaboration, and partnership. We hope that lessons learned, 44 partnerships built, workflows implemented, and new reimbursement models created during relevant, culturally competent, and community based care. ",
