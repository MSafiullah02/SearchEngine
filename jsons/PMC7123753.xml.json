As the incidence of acute rejection has declined, the probability of graft and patient survival continues to improve (USRDS 2015). Infection, however, remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality after kidney transplantation. It has been estimated that 70% of kidney transplant recipients will experience an infection episode within the first 3 years after transplantation (Dharnidharka et al. 2007). After cardiovascular disease, infection is the second leading cause of death in recipients with allograft function (Snyder et al. 2009). The immunosuppressive therapy required to prevent organ rejection places the kidney transplant recipient at increased risk for donor-derived, nosocomial, and community-acquired infections as well as reactivation of latent pathogens.",

Within the first month, infections are noted to include those related to surgical complications, nosocomial exposures, and donor-derived pathogens. Multidrug-resistant organisms including Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), and Carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae (CRE) are important considerations, as is Clostridium Difficile. Urinary tract infections are common within the first 6 months. Opportunistic infections are more likely to occur 1\u20136 months after transplantation, reflecting the greater impact of immune suppression during this time. Reactivation of latent pathogens such as polyoma virus BK, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and mycobacterium tuberculosis may also occur. Prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jiroveci, herpes viruses including CMV, and hepatitis B virus (HBV) makes these infections less common during this time period. Beyond 6 months, the degree of immune suppression for most patients decreases. Risk remains, however, for community-acquired infection, environmental exposures, recurrent infection, and the late presentation of viral infection, in particular CMV, once prophylaxis has been discontinued (Fishman 2007; Karuthu and Blumberg 2012).",

Infection with HIV, HBV, and HCV may not be detected in the early stages of infection. Many transplant centers now perform more sensitive rapid molecular testing on potential organ donors including nucleic acid amplification (NAT) testing for HIV, HBV, and HCV. A comprehensive medical and social history on potential organ donors is required in order to identify risk factors for blood borne pathogens. In efforts to expand the pool of available organs, recipients may consent to receipt of a kidney from a NAT negative donor who is deemed \u201chigh risk\u201d for blood borne infection based on identified risk factors. Recipients of such organs are monitored posttransplantation with testing for HIV, HBV, and HCV between 1 and 3 months and for HBV again at 12 months (Fischer et al. 2013; Seem et al. 2013; Kovacs et al. 2014; Len et al. 2014). Use of HCV- and HBV-positive organs can be considered in respective positive recipients. Furthermore, in 2013 the HIV Organ Policy Equity Act lifted a long-standing ban on allowing HIV-positive organs to be donated to HIV-positive recipients (Mgbako et al. 2013; Muller et al. 2015).",

Live attenuated influenza vaccination (FluMist) is not recommended in chronic kidney disease patients. An inactivated vaccine option should be used (CDC 2012).

Immunosuppressive drugs also influence the incidence and severity of CMV disease. For instance, cyclosporine increases the risk of CMV disease, whereas use of sirolimus seems to have a protective effect (San Juan et al. 2008) The use of antilymphocyte antibody (antithymocyte globulin or muromonab-CD3) is associated with a two to fivefold increase in the rate of CMV, but basiliximab and daclizumab do not seem to increase its incidence (De Keyzer et al. 2011).",

The following definitions are commonly used in the transplant literature to differentiate CMV infection from CMV disease. CMV infection is evidence of CMV replication regardless of symptoms, and CMV disease is evidence of CMV infection with symptoms, such as viral syndrome, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, or invasive tissue disease (e.g., pneumonitis, hepatitis, retinitis, gastrointestinal disease) (Humar and Snydman 2009). CMV disease and even asymptomatic CMV infection have been shown to be independent risk factors for reduced graft survival and overall mortality beyond 100 days posttransplantation (Sagedal et al. 2004). Infection with CMV has been implicated in acute allograft dysfunction and chronic allograft nephropathy (McLaughlin et al. 2002; Tong et al. 2002). CMV disease is also associated with posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), posttransplant diabetes mellitus, and transplant artery stenosis (Pouria et al. 1998; Hjelmesaeth et al. 2004; Manez et al. 1997).",

Given the significant effect of CMV on patient outcomes, prevention plays an important role. Serologic screening for CMV should be performed on both donor and recipient prior to transplant to categorize high risk patients. Several CMV vaccine candidates are under investigation although none are currently available. Universal prophylaxis involves giving antivirals to those recipients at risk posttransplant before the onset of infection, whereas in preemptive therapy patients are monitored at regular intervals and started on antivirals when there is early evidence of replication prior to onset of clinical disease. Chemoprophylaxis in high risk patients (D+/R\u2212) has shown to reduce the incidence of CMV disease by 60% and has decreased CMV associated mortality and opportunistic infection (Hodson et al. 2005). Preemptive therapy in high risk patients based on CMV viral load monitoring has not shown reduction in acute rejection or all-cause mortality (Strippoli et al. 2006). A randomized controlled trial by Kliem et al. in 2008 comparing oral ganciclovir chemoprophylaxis with viral load monitoring revealed improved graft survival in those who received ganciclovir chemoprophylaxis (Kliem et al. 2008). A recent Cochrane review from 2013 concluded that the efficacy of preemptive therapy compared with prophylaxis to prevent CMV disease remains unclear due to significant heterogeneity between studies and that additional head-to-head studies are required to determine the relative benefits and harms of preemptive therapy and prophylaxis to prevent CMV disease in solid organ transplant recipients (Owers et al. 2013).",

Valganciclovir has replaced ganciclovir because of better bioavailability, lower pill burden, and reduced availability of oral ganciclovir (Paya et al. 2004). The optimal length of prophylaxis is unknown, but recent trials have shown that 6 months of prophylaxis is more effective in decreasing the incidence of CMV disease in D+/R\u2212 kidney transplant recipients (Humar et al. 2010; Doyle et al. 2006). Current guidelines recommend dosing valganciclovir at 900 mg daily (adjusted for renal dysfunction) if tolerated in D+/R\u2212 recipients. Some centers have successfully treated patients with half of this dose (450 mg daily) with less drug toxicity. However, D+/R\u2212 recipients may be at higher risk of breakthrough infection and the development of resistance with this lower dosing strategy (Kotton et al. 2013).",

CMV resistance should be considered when patients have worsening disease or persistent, unchanged viremia at 2 weeks of therapy and in such cases, genotype testing for mutations of the genes encoding UL 97 and UL 54 should be performed (Weikert and Blumberg 2008). Treatment options for drug resistant CMV include the use of high dose ganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir; however, no clinical trial data are available regarding optimal therapy options for resistant CMV. The use of novel agents including leflunomide and artesunate has been attempted as salvage therapy with varying success. Several new antiviral treatment options are currently under investigation including maribavir and brincidofovir (an oral prodrug of cidofovir with less nephrotoxicity) for use in the treatment of drug resistant CMV (Limaye et al. 2000).",

In isolated graft PTLD, surgical resection is an option (Weikert and Blumberg 2008). In patients that fail the above strategies, IFN and IVIG have been used with varying success and cytotoxic chemotherapy with radiation remains salvage therapy (Green et al. 2004).",

These viruses are common causes of fever in children and remain latent in lymphocytes following primary infection. HHV 6 uses the CD46 molecule as its receptor but may also infect other cell types, such as monocytes, and epithelial and endothelial cells. HHV 7 uses the CD4 molecule as its receptor and is more strictly lymphotropic. Infection occurs as a result of reactivation in the first 4 weeks following transplant often in recipients not on CMV prophylaxis (Singh and Carrigan 1996). Clinical manifestations include fever, rash, hepatitis, interstitial pneumonitis, encephalitis, leukopenia, and myelosuppression. Owing to its immunomodulatory effects, it is hypothesized that HHV 7 may act as a cofactor for HHV 6 and CMV reactivation, while both HHV 6 and HHV 7 may act as cofactors in the pathogenesis of CMV disease and acute rejection (Kidd et al. 2000; Chapenko et al. 2000; Dockell and Paya 2001). The diagnosis of HHV 6 and HHV 7 is made by tissue immunohistochemistry or NAT testing of peripheral blood lymphocytes. Treatment includes reduction in immunosuppression and ganciclovir, but cidofovir and foscarnet have also been utilized (Green et al. 2004; Kotton and Fishman 2005; Dockell and Paya 2001). ",

            "text": " Patients with chronic renal failure, in particular those receiving hemodialysis, are at increased risk for contracting hepatitis B virus (HBV). The prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive patients has declined because of HBV vaccination, strict segregation of HBsAg-positive patients in dialysis units, improved screening of blood products, and the use of erythropoiesis stimulating agents (Karuthu and Blumberg 2012). Approximately 2\u201310% of patients with a history of HBV prior to transplant will reactivate posttransplant (Weikert and Blumberg 2008). Serial monitoring of HBV DNA every 3\u20136 months is required after transplantation as liver enzyme levels do not reflect infection status and elevated viral loads suggest resistance to therapy (Levitsky et al. 2013). In a meta-analysis conducted by Fabrizi and his colleagues, HBsAg seropositivity was an independent risk factor for allograft loss and posttransplant death (Fabrizi et al. 2005). The treatment options currently approved for chronic HBV include: IFN alpha, pegylated IFN, lamivudine, entecavir, telbivudine, tenofovir, and adefovir (Fabrizi et al. 2005; Chan et al. 2002; Chang et al. 2010). KDIGO recommends that interferon treatment generally be avoided because of the high associated incidence of rejection. Tenofovir or entecavir are preferable to lamivudine, to minimize the development of drug resistance, unless medication cost requires that lamivudine be used. During therapy with antivirals, HBV DNA and ALT levels should be measured every 3 months to monitor efficacy and to detect drug resistance. All HBsAg-positive renal transplant recipients should receive prophylaxis with tenofovir, entecavir, or lamivudine. HBsAg-positive patients with cirrhosis should be screened for hepatocellular carcinoma every 12 months with liver ultrasound and alpha feto-protein. Patients who are negative for HBsAg and have HBsAb titer <10 mIU/ml should receive booster vaccination to raise the titer to >100 mIU/ml (KDIGO 2009).",

Thus, it is preferable to treat HCV in transplant candidates prior to transplantation given the potential for improved outcomes with successful HCV treatment and the complications associated with treatment posttransplant. Patients with a sustained virologic response to pretransplant treatment have a reduced risk for HCV recurrence and decreased posttransplant GN (Dom\u0131nguez-Gil and Morales 2009). Options for treatment include interferon/peginterferon alone or in combination with ribavirin. The risk of toxicity with the addition of ribavirin has limited the use of combination therapy in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. The availability of direct acting HCV protease and polymerase inhibitors has sparked new enthusiasm for treating HCV-infected CKD patients and studies are ongoing evaluating the use of these agents in CKD. If treatment cannot be given prior to transplant, KDIGO recommends monotherapy with standard interferon for HCV-infected renal transplant recipients in whom the benefits of antiviral treatment clearly outweigh the risks (KDIGO 2009). The use of direct acting HCV antivirals posttransplantation can also be considered and will likely be preferred in the future given improved tolerance and efficacy with these agents with an understanding that drug interactions with calcineurin inhibitors may occur.A study looking at 20 HCV-positive kidney transplant recipients (60% treated pre-transplant with interferon unsuccessfully) treated with direct acting antivirals post-transplant found that 100% cleared the virus and had a sustained virologic response at 12 weeks. The most common agents used were sofosbuvir and simeprevir (Sawinski et al. 2016). ",

            "text": "A large prospective clinical trial examining outcomes among 150 HIV+ kidney transplant recipients reported 3-year patient and graft survival rates of 88.2% and 73.7%, respectively, which were similar to survival rates among a cohort of unmatched elderly (>65 years) HIV-negative (HIV\u2212) kidney recipients (Stock et al. 2010). The candidates for transplantation include those with well-controlled HIV infection with undetectable viral loads, CD4 >200 cells per microliter, and absence of untreatable infections or malignancies (Blumberg et al. 2009). The most significant complications in this patient population posttransplant include increased rejection rates (up to 25%), managing drug interactions between ART and immunosuppressive therapy and complications related to cardiovascular risk factors and hepatitis coinfection (Blumberg et al. 2009). The choice of ART should be based on susceptibility results and if possible, the use of protease inhibitors should be avoided owing to significant drug interactions with this class of ART. With regards to immunosuppressive therapy, the use of thymoglobulin may result in prolonged depression of CD4 counts, whereas monocloncal anti-IL2 receptor antibodies, such as basiliximab/daclizumab, have been shown to increase CD4 cell counts (Ciuffreda et al. 2007; Carter et al. 2006). The risks of antilymphocyte therapy should be balanced with the risks of rejection in HIV-infected recipients. Of note, HIV-positive donors can now be considered in HIV-positive recipients. ",

Clinical manifestations include upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, and pneumonia. In addition to respiratory illness, adenovirus is known to cause gastroenteritis, hemorrhagic cystitis, pancreatitis, meningoencephalitis, necrotizing hepatitis, and nephritis/renal dysfunction in renal transplant recipients (Pham et al. 2003; Alsaad et al. 2007). Infection with these viruses may also be associated with rejection (Weikert and Blumberg 2008). Prevention involves hand hygiene and the use of droplet precautions for those suspected of having infection. Influenza vaccination is recommended prior to transplant and yearly following transplant. Treatment of respiratory viral infection involves supportive care and antiviral medications. Influenza can be treated with oseltamivir or zanamavir. Ribavirin is approved for the treatment of RSV. Adenovirus infection is treated with reduction of immunosuppression with consideration of cidofovir (Ison 2006).",

Some of the emerging viruses causing infections in renal transplant population include Human T-cell Leukemia Virus Type 1 (HTLV-1), Hepatitis E virus (HEV), Measles virus, Rabies virus, Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), Dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus, and Zika virus. Case reports of adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) following renal transplantation in HTLV-1-positive patients have been documented, though in a case series of renal transplant recipients with long-term follow-up, no cases of ATL or HTLV-1-associated myelopathy (HAM) developed (Nakamura et al. 2005; Tanabe et al. 1998). HEV may induce kidney injury with significant reduction in glomerular filtration rate. Glomerular injuries such as membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis have been described in kidney transplant patients with acute and chronic HEV infections (Kamar et al. 2012). The incidence of measles in transplant recipients is unclear. Cases of subacute measles encephalitis (SME) have developed in renal transplant recipients. The clinical course is one of deteriorating mental status and treatment refractory seizures (Waggoner and Deresinski 2013). Worldwide, vector-borne viral disease is increasing in incidence and can be transmitted with blood products and organ transplantation. Fatal cases of dengue have been reported within the first month following renal transplant (Waggoner and Deresinski 2013). West Nile virus has also been reported in transplant recipients with a high incidence of neuroinvasive disease and poor outcomes. ZIka virus is also now a concern. Cases of donor-derived rabies in the SOT population have been reported. Patients typically developed encephalitis between 1 and 2 months posttransplant, and all symptomatic reported patients died (Srinivasan et al. 2005). Cases of LCMV causing severe disease in organ transplant patients have been documented. The 4 clusters of LCMV infection occurred in the United States and involved kidney, liver, and lung transplants; symptoms included fever, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, and altered mental status (Srinivasan et al. 2005; Barry et al. 2008; Fischer et al. 2006). Two renal transplant recipients survived LCMV infection. Ribavirin has been employed in some cases, though the benefits remain unclear (Waggoner and Deresinski 2013). Data regarding the incidence, screening and treatment options of the above-mentioned emerging viruses are limited. Given the risk of donor-derived viral transmission, organs should not be accepted from donors with unexplained febrile or neurologic illness. In unclear cases, the risk of donor-derived infection should be balanced with the benefit of the transplant. ",

Removal of foreign bodies such as intravenous catheters and stents is also necessary for cure.",

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis used after transplant to prevent pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP) likely prevents Nocardia infection as well. Nocardia asteroides is the most common species and causes pulmonary infections, including cavitary lesions and pleural effusions (Patel and Paya 1997). Other common sites of infection, due to dissemination, are central nervous system (CNS) and cutaneous. All patients with Nocardia should be evaluated for CNS disease. Allograft rejection, high-dose prednisone, azathioprine, instead of cyclosporine based immunosuppression, and neutropenia are risk factors for this infection (Patel and Paya 1997). Diagnosis is made by the identification of branching and beading rods on gram and modified acid fast staining and cultures of infected sites. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing should be performed on all isolates. High dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole sometimes in combination with amikacin is the treatment of choice, but allergic reactions and other side effects sometimes limit their use. Alternatives include imipenem, minocycline, and ceftriaxone, but choices should be based on susceptibilities and site of infection (Spelman 2016). Nocardia infections can relapse and prolonged therapy up to a year is recommended followed by chronic suppressive therapy (Spelman 2016; Arduino et al. 1993). ",

Although more common during the first 2 months after transplantation, infection may occur at any point, and risk is increased with rejection therapy (Patel and Paya 1997). Infections involving the central nervous system, such as meningitis and meningoencephalitis, are most common and present with headaches, fever, meningismus, altered mental status, and possibly focal neurologic deficits including cranial nerve palsies and seizures (Patel and Paya 1997). Cerebrospinal fluid examination typically reveals a pleocytosis, mostly polymorphonuclear leukocytes, decreased glucose, and elevated protein, but as the name implies, a mononuclear predominance may occur instead. Gram staining has a low sensitivity and may be negative or reveal gram positive bacilli which may be confused with diphtheroids. Other sites of infection include bacteremia, pneumonia, endophthalmitis, and septic arthritis. While trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, used for P. carinii prophylaxis, may also prevent infection with Listeria, the treatment of choice is intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin for up to 8 weeks in those with CNS infections to prevent relapses. Gentamicin is usually continued for a shorter duration, about 2 weeks if kidney function is stable. (Gelfand 2016). Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is an alternative treatment for those who are allergic to penicillin. Decreasing immunosuppressive agents is sometimes, but not always necessary. ",

Its overall incidence is lower in the United States when compared to the rest of the world, and foreign-born recipients are at greatest risk. Having a high index of suspicion is important in renal transplant patients because presentation can be atypical and pretransplant screening with tuberculin skin tests or IFN-gamma release assays are unreliable in chronic kidney disease patients due to anergy. Extra-pulmonary sites of infection and disseminated disease occur in about a third of cases (Karuthu and Blumberg 2012). Laryngeal, meningeal, skeletal, cutaneous, intestinal, and renal infections are examples of extra-pulmonary disease.
