Human coronaviruses were first identified in the mid-1960s (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/index.html). Coronaviruses belong to the Coronaviridae family. Coronaviridae is a family of enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus. The total length of the genome is 30 Kb, consisting of a 5\u2019-terminal noncoding region, an open reading box (ORF) 1a/b-coding region, an s region encoding the spike glycoprotein (S protein), an e region encoding the envelope protein (E protein), an m region encoding the membrane protein (M protein), an n region encoding the nucleocapsid protein (N protein), and a -3\u2019-terminal noncoding region. Among them, the poly protein encoded in the ORF1a/b region of the nonstructural protein can be cut by 3CLpro and PLpro of the virus to form RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and helicase, which can guide the replication, transcription, and translation of the virus genome.3 The structural protein S can specifically bind to the receptor of the host cell, and this is the key protein for viruses to invade susceptible cells. The M and E proteins are involved in the formation of the virus envelope, while the N protein is involved in the assembly of the virus.",

The coronaviruses of the \u03b1 and \u03b2 genera generally infect mammals and humans, while the coronaviruses of the \u03b3 and \u03b4 genera mainly infect birds. SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus of the \u03b2 genus; it is round or oval, with a diameter of approximately 60\u2013140 nm and a crown-shaped appearance under an electron microscopy.4 Besides SARS-CoV-2, six other coronaviruses can infect humans, including human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), OC43 (HCoV-OC43), NL63 (HCoV-NL63), HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1), SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. A protein sequence analysis showed that the amino acid similarity of the seven conserved nonstructural proteins between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV was 94.6%, suggesting that they might belong to the same species. The homology between the SARS-CoV-2 genome and the bat SARS-like coronavirus (Bat-CoV (RaTG13)) genome is 96%.5",

            "text": "Coronavirus can cause human respiratory tract infection or animal intestinal infection. The process of virus infection requires the participation of receptors on the surface of the host cell membrane. The S protein on the surface of coronavirus can recognize and bind to the receptor and then invade the host cell through clathrin-mediated endocytosis.6 Different coronaviruses can use different cell receptors to complete the invasion. For example, the receptor of HCoV-229E is aminopeptidase N (also known as CD13), the receptor of SARS-CoV is ACE2,7 and the receptor of MERS-CoV is DPP4 (also known as CD26).8 It has been indicated that aminopeptidase N and DPP4 are not receptors of SARS-CoV-2 and that ACE2 can be used as its receptor.5 The pathogenicity of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 is relatively low, generally only causing slight respiratory symptoms. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can cause SARS and MERS, respectively. Both caused outbreaks with severe symptoms and a high mortality.7,8 Pathological findings of COVID-19 revealed that the overactivation of T cells, manifested by an increase in Th17 and the high cytotoxicity of CD8 T cells, partially accounts for the severe immune injury.9 People are generally susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, with an incubation period of 1\u201314 days, with an average of 3\u20137 days; the main source of infection is COVID-19 patients, and asymptomatic patients may also be the source of infection.10,11 The main route of transmission is respiratory droplets, and people can also be infected by coming into contact with articles contaminated with virus droplets. In addition, a study showed that SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid can be detected in the feces and urine of patients with COVID-19, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may be transmitted through the digestive tract through the fecal\u2013oral route. The main symptoms of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 are fever, dry cough, and fatigue. A few patients may have runny nose, sore throat, and diarrhea. Some patients may have dyspnea, and those who have a serious form of COVID-19 may rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, coagulation dysfunction, and septic shock.11,12 From the existing treatment cases, mild patients only show low fever and slight fatigue but no pneumonia. Most patients have a good prognosis, a few patients may have a severe condition, and the elderly and those with chronic basic diseases have a poor prognosis.",

A vaccine is an effective measure to protect susceptible populations.

It has a good inhibitory effect. Remdesivir, with complete pharmacokinetic results and good safety, may be one of the most promising drugs against SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Currently, under the leadership of China Japan Friendship Hospital, a phase III clinical trial of radcivir for the treatment of COVID-19 has been officially launched in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital on February 5, 2020, and its efficacy will be determined using a strict clinical double-blind test validation. Recent studies have shown that radcivir and chloroquine exhibit good inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.15 In addition, according to the novel coronavirus pneumonia diagnosis and treatment plan (trial version sixth), inhalation of alpha interferon inhalation and ralproveravir/ritonavir or intravenous injection of ribavirin can also be administered.13",
