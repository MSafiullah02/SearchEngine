            "text": "Spontaneous reporting systems for adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are essential for post-marketing drug safety surveillance [1]. Such systems have been widely used for many drug safety studies. Because nationally compiled data, especially pediatric patient data, may be limited, the Global Research in Pediatrics-Network of Excellence (GRiP) network aims to facilitate the development and safe use of medicine in children and is valuable for examining drug safety [2]. The GRiP project describes the characteristics of individual case safety reports (ICSRs) as reported in a spontaneous reporting database operated by Food and Drug Administration in the United States [1]. Although, in general, a spontaneous ADR reporting database has some limitations such as a lack of denominator of users, an understanding of the structure and scope of the datasets and the respective strengths and limitations of such a database is essential for correct use and interpretation. An understanding of the characteristics of a database is the first and important step for evaluating and developing new methodologies for pharmacovigilance or drug safety [1]. Several retrospective studies of database for ADR reports have clarified their characteristics and availability for use as a database of drug safety surveillance among children in other countries, including the United States [3], Sweden [4], the United Kingdom [5], France [6], Malaysia [7], Spain [8], and Nigeria [9].",

Information on serious ADRs from individual cases and study reports from industries, direct voluntary reports from medical institutions, study results from treatment outcome studies, and post-marketing clinical trials has been accumulated since the enactment of the law. Post-2004 ADR reports have been compiled in the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report database (JADER), which includes some items from ICSRs, such as patient demographic information, drug information, adverse events, and primary illness. This information became available for free download to anyone from the Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) website since 2012 (https://www.info.pmda.go.jp/fukusayoudb/CsvDownload.jsp). This pharmacovigilance database provides a general picture of ADRs and suggests the relative plausibility using quantitative signal detection methodologies. However, there are no studies investigating the characteristics and utility of the JADER as a resource for drug safety surveillance in pediatric patients. Hence, in this study, we studied ADR reporting for pediatric patients in the JADER with an aim to elucidate the characteristics of the ADR reports therein in pediatric patients.",

The ADR reports are checked and evaluated whether the ADR report is serious or not before being registered in the JADER by the PMDA, and the JADER in principle comprises serious ADR reports selected by the PMDA. A single ADR report often includes multiple ADRs, which can include non-serious events such as pyrexia and rash. The PMDA recommend companies and healthcare professionals to report ADRs through a system called the Drugs and Medical Devices Safety Information Reporting System, even if the causal relationship between medication use and ADR was unclear. As for patients, the Direct Patient Reporting System for ADR, in which patients and consumers can report ADRs directly to the PMDA, was tentatively started from 2012 as a pilot program and a full-scale operation of the system was started on March 26, 2019. However, the JADER has not included the reports from this system yet. The JADER consists of four tables: (1) patient demographic information (2) drug information (3) adverse events, and (4) primary disease. We extracted spontaneous reports from companies and healthcare facilities. Spontaneous reports were defined as ADR reports derived from unsolicited sources in the International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use guideline E2B, which included direct reports from healthcare facilities or companies, ADR reports from abstracts, literature, Internet, etc. Because a different system exists for the reporting of adverse reactions due to vaccines, vaccine reports were excluded. The adverse reaction and primary disease fields in the JADER are described by using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities/Japanese version (MedDRA\u00ae/J) and were coded as preferred terms (PTs). We used MedDRA\u00ae/J Version 21.0 in the present study. The information included patient details (age and sex), type of report sender, reporters, suspected drugs, outcomes from ADR reports, and ADRs coded according to PTs. Age, sex, type of report sender (company or healthcare facility), reporters (doctor, pharmacist, healthcare professional, consumer, or lawyer), number of suspected drugs per ADR report, outcomes from ADR reports (cured, recovering, did not recover, recovering with sequelae, death, or unexplained) were collected. As for suspected drugs, we collected both International Nonproprietary Name (INN) and brand name and used INN to treat drugs with the same ingredients as the same drugs for analysis. Since the JADER only included age information as a categorical variable, we extracted ADR reports for children aged < 10 and 10\u201319 years. The 10 most frequently reported drugs, reactions, and drug-reaction pairs were determined according to age (< 10 years and 10\u201319 years). Time trends for the number of reports and the frequently reported drug, reaction, and drug-reaction pair were also determined. Adverse events were considered serious when they resulted in death, were life threatening, required hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, were congenital abnormalities or birth defects or were any other medically significant events.",

Of these, the number of spontaneous reports was 386,400 (76.6%), in which 37,534 (7.4%) were unknown age reports. After extraction of 27,800 ADR reports for children aged < 10 and 10\u201319 years, we excepted for ADR reports associated with a vaccine (n = 6355) and no-suspected drug reports (n = 86). A total of 21,359 (4.2%) reports were finally included in this analysis. More than half of the ADR reports pertained to children aged < 10 years (Table 1). In the ADR notifications, the distribution of patients by sex was 53.5% boy and 40.5% girl for patients aged < 10 years and 51.3% boy and 46.5% girl for patients aged 10\u201319 years. Regardless of age, most of the reports in the JADER were sent by companies and > 70% were sent by doctors. Figure 1 shows the steadily increasing trend in the number of ADR reports. Approximately 30% of ADR reports had multiple suspected drugs, which did not differ by age (Table 1). For patients aged < 10 years, there were 11,786 ADR reports in total, of which 552 (4.7%) were fatal ADR reports with death reported as an outcome. For patients aged 10\u201319 years, there were 9573 ADR reports in total, of which 369 (3.9%) were fatal ADR reports with death as an outcome. The proportion of fatal ADR reports was higher when ADR reports had multiple suspected drugs (Table 1).\n",

One of the reasons for the higher percentage of fatal cases was that the JADER is a spontaneous ADR database that in principle comprises serious ADR reports selected by the PMDA and databases in other countries included non-serious ADRs. Therefore, the percentage of fatal cases may reflect differences in the use of medicines and attitudes toward reporting in different countries [12].",

Our study found that the percentage of fatal ADR reports was higher when ADR reports had multiple suspected drugs. Although polypharmacy might reflect a severe disease that requires the use of multiple drugs, a previous assessment of the severity of the reported ADRs found that multiple drug exposure might more often lead to serious ADR reports compared to single drug use [13]. Another study found that the use of more than four drugs simultaneously positively correlated with ADR occurrence [14]. Polypharmacy increases the chance of drug-drug interactions and the possibility of ADR occurrence [15, 16]. Because our finding was based on the examination of spontaneous reports, we simply observed reporting tendency. However, considering previous findings in addition to our own, we may pay particular attention to ADRs for children who are prescribed two or more drugs to minimize the risk of serious ADRs.",

The potential risk of serious adverse events varies with age and the variability in ADRs by pediatric patient age also differs depending on whether children can complain of side effects. In other words, objective reactions may be reported more often by younger children than by older children, and subjective reactions may be reported more often by older children than by younger children. Therefore, information on age is essential in discussions about ADRs, especially in pediatric patients. However, the present study could not obtain age-related information as a continuous variable and it was used as a categorical variable, such as \u2018< 10 years\u2019 and \u201810\u201319 years\u2019, and it was the weakest attribute related to the JADER. In this study, objective reactions were mainly reported. Pediatric ADR reports, therefore, need to be considered with a more detailed age classification. Age information should have been reported as a continuous variable in original ADR reports; however, the JADER only includes age information as a categorical variable because of privacy considerations. To increase the availability and value of the JADER, age information as a continuous variable should be disclosed, especially in pediatric ADR reports.",

Abnormal behaviors related to oseltamivir created concern, and the Dear Healthcare Professional Letters about the abnormal behaviors related to oseltamivir were published by a Japanese regulatory agency on November 27, 2007. In addition, the use of zanamivir, a similar drug to oseltamivir, increased with the advent of the oseltamivir-resistant virus in 2008\u20132009. In early post-marketing phase vigilance (EPPV), a unique system of post-marketing surveillance started in October 2001 in Japan, medical representatives regularly visit medical institutions during the first 6 months of marketing to collect ADRs, so a positive association between the EPPV period and the number of ADRs reported has been suggested [17, 18]. However, EPPV did not have a positive impact on the increase in the number of ADR reports regarding abnormal behavior related to oseltamivir in 2007 because EPPV for oseltamivir was conducted in 2002 in Japan. ADR reports on \u201coseltamivir and abnormal behavior\u201d and \u201czanamivir and abnormal behavior\u201d were thought to have become frequent just after the publication of the letters, although the causal relationship between oseltamivir and abnormal behavior has not been clarified. However, because the percentage of reports on \u201canti-influenza virus drugs and abnormal behavior\u201d was not so much (1.1% under 10 years old and 1.4% among children aged 10\u201319 years), those pairs might not influence on detecting the other signals. In Spain, after the publication of warnings on the use of antidepressants and treatment of attention deficit disorder and hyperactivity linked to the risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disorders in pediatric patients by regulatory agencies, the number of ADR reports regarding cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disorders following the use of antidepressants and treatment of attention deficit disorder and hyperactivity increased [8]. The number of reports of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) associated with acetaminophen was also very high. This result might be explained by some reasons as follow; acetaminophen is often used for children, and initiation of acetaminophen treatment occurs in response to fever or ear, nose and throat pain, which might be often the prodromal symptoms of SJS/TEN and that of an infectious disease such as mycoplasma infection or a viral Infections such as influenza accountable for SJS/TEN [19\u201321].",

First, the JADER is a passive system, marked by multiple limitations, such as reporting of temporal association, unconfirmed diagnoses, a lack of denominator of users, and unbiased comparison grope [22]. Because of these limitations, it is usually not possible to establish causality between drugs and adverse reactions from JADER reports. Second, it was not possible to analyze the situation according to WHO age group classification such as children aged 5\u201317 years because the JADER only included age information as a categorical variable such as children aged < 10 and 10\u201319 years. Nomura et al. have already compared Japanese ADR reports between the FAERS and the JADER [23]. Although the FAERS included non-US data received by drug companies worldwide and it was possible to select Japanese reports with detailed information for age, they clarified that the FAERS and the JADER had different properties. Therefore, in our study, we clarified the characteristics of ADR reports for Japanese children by using the JADER. Third, in the JADER, detailed information on the source of spontaneous ADR reports was not revealed. Therefore, there remains the possibility of duplicated reports, whereby one case might be reported multiple times. This possibility cannot be completely excluded because there are no identifiers for the same case. The identification and elimination of duplicates from an analysis are advantageous and important for the correct interpretation of the data. In future studies, we will evaluate the ability of the JADER for signal detection based on the characteristics of the JADER clarified in this study.",
