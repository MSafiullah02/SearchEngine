In terms of survival, Meduri et al. demonstrated the potential benefits of antiinflammatory treatment instituted in the late stages of ARDS during the fibroproliferative phase [1] . However, the benefits of this approach require differentiation of an infection and the beginning of fibrosis. Current microbiological examinations (tracheal aspiration, protected specimen brush [PSB] , bronchoalveolar lavage [BAL]) lack sensitivity and/or specificity for the diagnosis of infection. The unsuitable character of these examinations for the diagnosis of fibrosis, despite the possibility of dosing serum and alveolar biological markers of fibrosis, such as procollagen III, justify performing histologic and microbiologic analysis of lung parenchyma samples obtained by biopsy.",

Such fibrosis was found in 40% of the cases in a series of open-lung biopsies performed in 36 patients with ARDS [7] . Fibrosis is formed by an anarchic endoalveolar and septal deposit of type III collagen, then type I, secreted by the fibroblasts. Alveolar and capillary spaces are therefore obstructed, considerably disturbing pulmonary architecture and function. At this stage, the edema has usually disappeared. In addition, there is intraalveolar angiogenesis in response to excessive growth factor production. Macroscopically, the lung has a rough appearance, with a pale and spongiform appearance in sections. Numerous cystic areas and fibrous scars are often observed. Fibrosis can be detected beginning on the fifth day of ARDS. The process most certainly begins earlier given the presence of procollagen III (precursor of collagen synthesis) at elevated levels in the alveolar liquid after 24 hours of evolution [8, 9] . Elevated plasma and alveolar procollagen III levels appear to be predictive markers for ARDS mortality [10, 11] . However, to our knowledge, no study has correlated procollagen levels with the presence of fibrosis confirmed by lung biopsy.",

A series of 36 patients with ARDS who had undergone surgical pulmonary biopsy had cytomegalovirus (CMV) in 50% of the cases [7] . Moreover, biologic analysis of alveolar liquid by dosage of certain markers such as cytokines, alveolar proteins, procollagen III for diagnosis of fibrosis is not yet in current practice. Lung biopsy could, therefore, be indicated when initial examinations are not conclusive, when ARDS is not evolving favorably after five days (no reduction in Lung Injury Score [LIS] [16] ) or earlier if a neoplasic etiology is suspected. The absolute or relative contraindications, hemorrhagic, hemodynamic, or respiratory risks must be taken into account according to the technique under consideration.

            "text": "Transbronchial biopsy is performed under bronchial endoscopy (flexible fiberscope or rigid endoscope) directed or not by fluoroscopy. Four to seven biopsies are performed in the same territory to provide for both microbiologic and histologic analyses. This is an attractive technique for pneumologists because it is usually practiced with a flexible fiberscope in awake patients under local anesthesia. A few Lung Biopsy in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome studies have demonstrated the feasibility and safety of this technique in patients under mechanical ventilation [6, 17, 18] . Simple measures must therefore be taken during this procedure: increase of FiO 2 to 1, discontinuation of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and rise of maximum pressure alarms. In a recent study of 38 mechanically ventilated patients [19] , all with unexplained pulmonary infiltration, BAL and transbronchial biopsy were successively performed. They provided a diagnosis in 74% of the subjects and led to a modification in treatment in 63% of the cases. Transbronchial biopsy alone ensured a diagnosis in 63% of the cases whereas BAL alone provided a diagnosis in 29%. In the subgroup of late-phase ARDS patients (n = 11), the diagnosis was established in 64% of the cases by associating both diagnostic methods: fibroproliferation was found in all of the cases, leading to prescription of corticoids. An examination of the various studies on the subject reveals that transbronchial biopsy provides a diagnosis in an average of 40% of the cases. Nevertheless, the yield of this technique is controversial given the small size of the samples or their low numbers, which sometimes make a quality histological examination difficult [7] . In a study of 116 transbronchial biopsies, Fraire et al. reported a correlation between the number of fragments obtained, the number of alveoli per fragment (more than 20) and the specificity of the histologic results in the diagnosis of infectious pneumonia [20] . A study comparing transbronchial biopsy with open-lung biopsy in 20 patients with chronic pulmonary infiltration demonstrated the superiority of the surgical technique with a diagnosis in 94% of the cases for surgical biopsy and 59% with transbronchial biopsy [21] . However, there are still some arguments in favor of the latter, such as the simplicity of its performance and the possibility to repeat the examination more easily than in the case of surgical biopsy. The risks of this technique in addition to those inherent to bronchial endoscopy are essentially pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and hemoptysis. The lateral bronchi of the basal pyramid appear to offer less risk in terms of pneumothorax [22] . In cases of diffuse pulmonary pathology, the American Thoracic Society does not recommend systematic use of fluoroscopy since it did not appear to modify yield or the risks of this procedure in a non-randomized prospective study [23] . The risk of hemoptysis is reduced by ensuring that the coagulation results and platelet count are compatible with the procedure. An old prospective series of 5450 transbronchial biopsies performed in non-ventilated patients reported a mortality rate of 0.25% (13 deaths, including 9 attributable to hemorrhagic complications, the majority with hemostasis problems). This same study showed the need for pneumothorax drainage in 5.5% of the cases [24] . Studies performed in ventilated patients have reported a mean incidence of 12% for pneumothorax (requiring drainage) without persistent bronchopleural fistula [6, 17, 18, 25, 26] and of 11% for moderate bleeding.",

The choice is preferably the most pathologic side unless pleural symphysis is suspected or in case of a history of lung resection on the same side. These elements are evaluated from the patient's history, chest x-ray and, if necessary, thoracic CT scan. During the biopsy, FiO 2 is set at 1. The patient is positioned in the supine position. A pad is positioned along the scapula homolateral to the biopsy in order to tilt the patient approximately 158. The homolateral upper limb is held in abduction with the forearm folded up over the head. A portable monopolar electrocoagulator is essential to complete hemostasis. An anterolateral thoracotomy of approximately 10 cm is performed in the fifth intercostal space. Pleural liquid (serofibrinous effusion is present in two-thirds of the patients) is sampled for cytologic and microbiologic analysis. Extreme care must be taken in handling the pulmonary tissue in order to avoid alveolar rupture. Particular attention is given to hemostasis. A single but broad biopsy is performed in an area that appears to be macroscopically pathologic. It is most often performed at the level of the lingula, from the middle or the lower lobes. The biopsy is performed with mechanical forceps with linear stapling. The ventilator must be temporarily disconnected in order to limit tissue thickness to ensure better aerostasis. The parenchymatous sample is then cut into four parts and each fragment is packaged in a specific manner for histologic, bacteriologic, virologic, and parasito-mycologic analyses. Two drains \u00b1 an anterior and a posterior \u00b1 are inserted. The mean duration of the procedure is 30 minutes. Verification by chest X-ray is performed at the end of the procedure.",

In order to avoid contamination, samples for infectious purposes are ideally sent directly from the operating room or the ICU to the microbiology laboratory in dry sterile jars where they are processed like the transbronchial biopsy. Samples for histologic purposes are sent to the anatomopathologic laboratory at a cool temperature in a dry flask with a screwed top and without the addition of a liquid. Samples must therefore be delivered as soon as possible \u00b1 within a maximum of one hour following the sampling. On reception and according to the clinical context communicated by the intensivist, specific analyses for microbiologic purposes can then be performed on the surgical specimen. Fragments can be frozen in nitrogen for molecular biology study or immunofluorescence or be placed in glutaraldehyde for study by electronic microscopy. The rest of the surgical specimen is fixed in formalin 10%. If the biopsy is small, it is always better to favor conventional morphology and fix the entire sample in formalin. The fixed fragment is processed in a conventional manner in an anatomopathologic laboratory like the transbronchial biopsy. The clinical consequences of pulmonary biopsy performed within the framework of ARDS can be major. Therapeutic modifications can be prescribed according to the anatomopathologic and/or microbiologic results: corticotherapy in case of fibroproliferation or fibrosis; prescription or modification of anti-infectious treatment, particularly in the framework of a cytomegalovirus or herpes infection [7] . In the same manner, a prognosis can be totally changed by these results: discovery of a potentially curable etiology, diagnosis of primary or secondary lung cancer (carcinomatous lymphangitis essentially in the framework of ARDS), fibrosis, which could benefit from anti-inflammatory treatment, worsening the vital prognosis. The time period before a specific treatment is administered (particularly corticotherapy in case of fibrosis) can be shortened by the carrying out of a rapid analysis before fixing and a more detailed analysis of the principal specimen, with a small fragment immediately taken to an anatomopathologic laboratory. In the same manner, immediate analysis makes it possible to avoid prescription of potentially deleterious corticotherapy if signs of infection, particularly viral, are detected. In a series of 36 patients [7] where prescription of corticotherapy was considered before surgical biopsy, only 40% (15 patients) really had an indication for anti-inflammatory treatment on receipt of the anatomopathologic results owing to the presence of fibroproliferation or fibrosis. Only six patients benefited from such treatment straightaway \u00b1 the nine others had CMV on biopsy.",
