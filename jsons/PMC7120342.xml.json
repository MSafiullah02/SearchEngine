These reports rate respiratory infections by opportunistic germs and rare tumors affecting healthy young men. High mortality rates were observed that were most likely caused by acute respiratory failure (ARF). Additionally, each report had abnormal ratios of lymphocyte subgroups. Subsequent reports described an escalating frequency of unusual infections and tumors, suggesting a profound state of immune suppression in many homosexual men, injection-drug users, sexual partners of infected persons, hemophiliacs who had received blood transfusions, and children.",

The most advanced stage of HIV infection was called AIDS. In the early years, the ICU survival rate of patients with AIDS was low [4]. Based on the belief that ICU care of patients with AIDS was futile, clinical, ethical, and economic issues were raised regarding the benefits and burdens of the critical care of these patients. However, the use of P. carinii pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis, antiretroviral therapy, and corticosteroids for PCP has changed outcomes. Several studies have shown improved survival rates and costs of HIV-infected patients admitted to the ICU [5\u20138].",

In contrast to this patient population is the sizable number of individuals who are either unaware of their HIV status or who lack access to care.

Also, patients with other associated infections, such as tuberculosis (TB) and fungal infection; or associated malignancy, such as Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma; or immune reconstitution syndrome (Fig. 21.2), may develop respiratory failure during disease evolution [9, 14]. The patients with ARF due to P. jiroveci and other opportunistic agents can be treated with noninvasive ventilation (NIV). The use of NIV improves gas exchange and avoids intubation and mechanical ventilation. Patients who failed with the use of NIV or present severe ARF still require intubation and mechanical ventilation.\n",

Several clinical factors are related to the outcome of AIDS patients in the ICU. Predictors of increased mortality risk include the need for mechanical ventilation, and disease severity [high Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score or simplified acute physiological score (SAPS), modified multisystem organ failure (MSOF) score, CD4 count, pneumothorax, presence of cardiovascular instability, and low levels of serum albumin] [14, 15].

Approximately 6% of patients can develop spontaneous pneumothoraces during the course of their illness. High-resolution computed tomography, which is more sensitive than chest radiography, may reveal extensive ground-glass attenuation or cystic lesions. This greater organism burden results in a higher diagnostic yield of induced sputum to confirm PCP in patients with AIDS. If the initial specimen of induced sputum is negative for pneumocystis, then bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) should be performed.

The application of these guidelines is especially crucial in patients with PCP because of the frequent presence of pneumatoceles associated with the infection and the resulting increased risk of pneumothorax during mechanical ventilation. The presence of pneumothorax is an independent risk factor for death in patients with HIV infection and PCP (15). Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole remains the preferred treatment. Other options could be primaquine plus clindamycin, atovaquone, and pentamidine [18, 28]. Early adjunctive corticosteroid therapy to suppress lung inflammation in patients with severe PCP and hypoxemia (partial pressure of arterial oxygen while the patient is breathing room air is <70 mm Hg or the alveolar\u2013arterial gradient is >35) reduces the risks of death in patients with AIDS [29].

Physical examination of the chest may be normal or may reveal crackles or evidence of pleural effusion. The chest radiographic findings of CMV pneumonia vary and include reticular or ground-glass opacities, alveolar infiltrates, and nodules or nodular opacities. Pleural effusions may be seen as well. The latter finding may be helpful in distinguishing CMV pneumonia from P.\njiroveci, in which pleural effusions are rare. Persons suspected of having CMV pneumonia should undergo a careful dilated retinal examination by an experienced ophthalmologist. Definitive diagnosis of CMV pneumonia requires demonstration of cytopathic inclusions and widespread specific cytopathic changes in the lungs. Confirming the diagnosis is often not easy due to the typically extremely serious condition, making it difficult to perform a lung biopsy. Autopsy studies revealed that patients with AIDS and CMV pneumonia were successfully diagnosed antemortem in only 13\u201324% of cases.

Since the emergence of AIDS, TB and HIV infections have been intimately connected. HIV probably increases susceptibility to infection with M.\ntuberculosis and the risk of progression to TB. Also, TB appears to accelerate the course of HIV disease [21]. By the end of 2000, approximately 11.5 million HIV-infected people worldwide were coinfected with M. tuberculosis. Seventy percent of coinfected people were in sub-Saharan Africa and 20% in Southeast Asia [42]. TB is the most common opportunistic disease and the most common cause of death in HIV patients in developing countries [43]. Severe TB requiring ICU care is rare but commonly known to be of markedly bad prognosis (Fig. 21.5). The most common reasons for ICU admission are the development of ARDS and severe organ failure, such as renal failure. ARF caused by TB necessitating mechanical ventilation has been associated with high mortality rates. Several studies also reported a critical course in patients with miliary TB and HIV infection.\n",

Weight loss and fever are more common in HIV-positive pulmonary TB patients than in those who are HIV negative. Conversely, cough and hemoptysis are less common in HIV-positive pulmonary TB patients than in those who are HIV negative. This is probably because there is less cavitation, inflammation, and endobronchial irritation in HIV-positive patients. The physical signs in patients with pulmonary TB are nonspecific. The most commonly reported extrapulmonary sites of disease are the lymph nodes, pleura, pericardium, meninges, and genitourinary system.

Treatment of drug-susceptible TB should include a 6-month regimen with an initial phase of isoniazid, rifampin or rifabutin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol administered for 2 months, followed by isoniazid and rifampin (or rifabutin) for 4 additional months. However, studies have found that HIV-seropositive patients are more likely to develop acquired drug resistance than are seronegative cases. Patients with TB caused by drug-resistant (especially multi-drug-resistant) organisms should be treated with specialized regimens containing second-line anti-TB drugs. At least four drugs to which the organisms are known or presumed to be susceptible should be used, and treatment should be given for at least 18 months. Delayed clinical suspicion and treatment of active pulmonary TB with ARF may contribute to the persistently high mortality rates in ICU patients with these diseases [28, 43, 44]. The optimal timing for initiating ART in patients with HIV and TB coinfection remains unclear. Despite World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines supporting concomitant treatment of the two diseases (TB/HIV), the initiation of antiretroviral therapy is often deferred until completion of TB therapy because of concern about potential drug interactions between rifampin and some classes of antiretroviral drugs, immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, and overlapping side effects. Abdool Karim et al., in a prospective and randomized trial, found that the initiation of ART during TB therapy in patients with confirmed TB and HIV coinfection reduced mortality rates by 56% [45].",

In contrast to the experience in nonimmunocompromised hosts, in whom clinical manifestations are primarily pulmonary, MAC causes disseminated infection, often with documented mycobacteremia in patients with AIDS. In the absence of effective HAART or chemoprophylaxis in those with AIDS-associated immunosuppression, the incidence of disseminated MAC disease is 20\u201340% [28]. Since early 1980s, MAC infection has been detected at autopsy in >50% of patients dying from AIDS, and in one study, infection due to MAC was detected antemortem in 44%, with blood culture being the most sensitive diagnostic means [46]. In HIV patients, MAC typically occurs among persons with CD4 counts <50 cells/\u03bcl, suggesting that specific T-cell products or activities are required for mycobacterial resistance [42]. Natural history studies of persons with AIDS in the pre-ART era showed that almost 40% of patients with <50 CD4+ T cells/\u03bcl developed disseminated MAC within 1 year. Other factors associated with increased susceptibility to MAC are high plasma HIV RNA levels (>100,000 copies/ml), previous opportunistic infections, previous colonization of the respiratory or gastrointestinal tract with MAC, and reduced in vitro lymphoproliferative immune responses to M. avium antigens, possibly reflecting defects in T-cell repertoire.",

This condition, termed immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), is thought to be caused by improvement in the host\u2019s immune response to pathogens [58]. The inflammatory response may be such that the patient develops ARF and requires ICU. Abdool Karim et al. [45] reported that the incidence of IRIS was 9.5%. However, the study found the incidence was higher in the integrated-therapy group (anti-TB and ART) than in the sequential-therapy group: 12.4 versus 3.8%, respectively. The term IRIS is most commonly used for mycobacterial infections (TB and disseminated MAC disease) but is also used for other opportunistic infections, including P. jirovecii pneumonia, toxoplasmosis, hepatitis B and C viruses, CMV, varicella\u2013zoster virus, cryptococcal infection, and histoplasmosis [28]. The syndrome is manifested as paradoxical worsening of the underlying respiratory disease and occurs days to months after HAART initiation. However, IRIS usually develops within the 4\u20138 weeks following HAART initiation and is caused by an exuberant inflammatory response to pneumocystis or mycobacterial antigens. On the basis of current knowledge, it is tempting to hypothesize that the immunological basis of IRIS is a HAART-induced rapid clonal expansion and redistribution of M. tuberculosis-specific memory T cells, which drives a deregulated immune activation [59] and a cytokine storm [60]. Antigen load could be responsible for the overvigorous inflammatory response of a recovering immune system.",
