In eight large states, we estimated that every year 4,000 mechanically ventilated patients die who might have been saved had they been in another hospital.9 Half of those patients died in a low-volume hospital within 5 miles of a high-volume center. Krumholz and colleagues10 have estimated that an additional 10,000 acute myocardial infarction patients might be saved annually if they received the same quality of care as provided by better hospitals. Of note, these lives might be saved using existing technology and knowledge without discovering new therapies.11\n",

A large hospital might not only be disabled from accepting patients (as we modeled) but need to send patients out when incapacitated. Planners could simulate the consequences of removing a central node from the system, anticipating any number of disaster scenarios; integration of network analysis with agent-based models may be of great value here.36 In cases of actual emergency, hospitals could quickly triage patients along existing transfer lines and identify new transfer lines when existing ones are broken.
