            "text": "Culture of cells in monolayers is the most common method used in diagnostic virology laboratories. Cell suspensions are prepared from tissue or from stock cultures by using one of the dispersing agents. The suspension is then diluted in growth medium to contain from 50,000 to 200,000 cells per milliliter and dispensed into suitable containers; these may be large bottles for stock cultures, test tubes for roller culture, Petri dishes, or coverslips in Leighton tubes. Growth medium usually consists of a synthetic medium such as 199 or Eagle's Basal Medium with added 10% calf serum. The serum may be varied in type or amount according to the virus or cells being cultured. After about 3 days the cultures are changed to maintenance medium which may contain 1% serum or be serum-free. Antibiotics are usually included. The optimum temperature for growth is 37\u00b0C, but after inoculation a lower temperature may be more satisfactory. Incubation may be stationary or in a roller drum. Containers which are not stoppered, e.g., Petri dishes, must be incubated in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2 in air.",

A suspension of cells is prepared in growth medium and added in a concentration which will produce a monolayer. If Petri dishes are used it is helpful to make the coverslips adhere to the glass with a small spot of wax or silicone grease. Petri dishes may need to be incubated in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air but the use of HEPES buffer will overcome this. The method has been found particularly useful in the diagnosis of rubella to detect rubella-specific IgM antibody.13 Coverslip cultures of BHK 21 cells are prepared and inoculated with rubella virus. After incubation the cultures are fixed in acetone and can be preserved at \u2013 20\u00b0C in the presence of silica gel. Uninfected cultures are also necessary. To detect rubella-specific IgM in human serum, dilutions of the serum are overlaid on the rubella-infected coverslip cultures. After incubation for 30 minutes followed by a thorough washing the coverslips are treated with fluorescein-labeled anti-human IgM. Specific fluorescence indicates the presence of rubella-specific IgM antibody due to recent infection.2.\nSuspended cell cultures. Indirect immunofluorescence is used routinely to measure antibodies to EB virus.14 Coverslip cultures cannot be prepared in the usual way since EB cells are cultured in suspension and do not attach to the surface of a glass vessel. Cell smears are therefore prepared. After centrifugation of the cultures the supernatant fluid is removed and the cells are resuspended in the remaining fluid. A small drop of this suspension is placed on a coverslip, evenly distributed over the surface, and allowed to dry thoroughly at 37\u00b0C. The coverslips are then fixed. Using the indirect method the coverslip preparations are exposed to diluted test serum (1:8) for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C. After washing, fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled serum prepared to the appropriate globulin is added and left for a further incubation period; the coverslips are then washed and mounted. Specific fluorescence in the cells indicates EB antibody and the test can be made quantitative by using dilutions of serum.\n",

An accurate measurement of the number of plaque-forming units may be calculated after incubation. The neutralizing capacity of serum may be measured by mixing the serum with a known amount of virus and comparing the number of plaques produced by the mixture with the number produced by virus without serum.

            "text": "This test depends on the ability to use the metabolism of cell cultures as an indication of virus growth.17 Acid is produced by actively growing cultures but if the metabolism is inhibited by the presence of virus the pH will be different; such differences can be measured if an indicator is incorporated in the medium. Neutralization tests can therefore be carried out using this principle, i.e., if virus is neutralized by antiserum and inoculated into cell cultures the cells will continue to metabolize whereas if there is no neutralization metabolism will be reduced. This test can be carried out in tubes, macroplates or microplates. Rigid disposable plastic plates have proved satisfactory. Serum dilutions in 0.025-ml amounts can be prepared in the plates and an equal quantity of virus added. After incubation of the serum-virus mixtures for 1 hour a suitable dilution of cells in 0.1 ml medium is added. The plates are then sealed with transparent tape and incubated. If phenol red is incorporated in the medium, neutralization will be indicated by a yellow color; the virus control will be pink. Time of incubation will vary for different viruses and modifications such as the addition of extra glucose and/or magnesium chloride have been made. The test has been used for coxsackie B viruses and rhinoviruses and has proved valuable to distinguish between wild and vaccine strains of poliovirus. It is economical on reagents and space.",
