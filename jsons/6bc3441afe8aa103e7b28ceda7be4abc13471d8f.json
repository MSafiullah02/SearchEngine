Here, we report the identification and isolation of vaccine strains of avian paramyxovirus serotype 1 (APMV1) and avian coronaviruses (ACoV) from different wild bird species across eight Egyptian governorates between January 2014 and December 2015. Surveillance of avian respiratory viruses in free-ranging wild birds (n = 297) identified three species that harboured or excreted APMV1 and ACoVs. Genetic characterization and phylogenetic analysis of recovered viruses revealed a close association with the most widely utilized vaccine strains in the country. These results highlight the potential spillover of vaccine-viruses probably due to extensive use of live-attenuated vaccines in the commercial poultry, and close interaction between domesticated and wild bird populations. Further exploring the full spectrum of vaccine-derived viral vaccine strains in wild birds might help to assess the emergence of future wild-birds origin viruses.",

Likewise, the transmission of virulent (e.g. escape mutant) viruses that have evolved either in response to vaccine pressure or through undetected viral contaminants within commercial vaccines are being transmitted to wild birds [2] . In high-tech commercial poultry farming, the possibility of spillover scenario into wild birds can be mitigated by the strict biosecurity measures. However, backyard poultry rearing meliorates these contacts especially in agriculture-enriched countries [4] .",

In the present study, considering all preliminary evidences on the presence of live vaccines in wild birds [5, 6] , we examined the hypothesis that APMV1 and ACoV vaccines may spill into wild birds. To this end, we performed virus surveillance in the Egyptian wild birds, and assessed the magnitude of ACoV and APMV1 prevalence in the country. The sequenced data from identified strains of APMV1 and ACoV from Egyptian wild birds were assessed along with the previously reported data in public domains on the vaccine-derived APMV1 and ACoV strains. Cumulative data indicates that ACoV and APMV1 vaccine strains can be identified in wild birds that are housed in the vicinity of commercial poultry farms. These viral vaccinestrains isolated from wild birds have shown significant genetic similarities with the vaccine strains being applied in the commercial poultry farms suggesting the possible reverse spillover of these viruses to nearby wild life. These findings highlight the need to fully investigate the dynamics and spectrum of vaccine-derived viral strains in wild birds and that such virus detection would severely jeopardise the welfare of the wild birds and may in future leads to virus evolution with increased virulence, as has been proposed for avian influenza viruses [1, 2] .",

Phylogenetic trees were constructed utilizing the obtained nucleotide sequences for F and S1 genes of APMV1 and ACoV, respectively based on Bayesian Inference within the program MrBayes version 3.1.2 [15] . Two independent Markov chain Monte Carlo were executed and sampled every 1000 generations using the default parameters of the priors' panel. The analysis was based on the GTR + I + G model, which allow significantly changed posterior probability estimates. To confirm the Bayesian tree topologies, phylogenetic relationship was also established with the MEGA version 6.0 software program using the maximum likelihood method with the Kimura twoparameter model [16] . The evolutionary distances were inferred using the pairwise distance method and expressed as the number of nucleotide substitutions per site giving a statistical significance of the tree topology by 1000 bootstrap resampling of the data [16] .",

These samples were individually screened using the RT-PCR targeting the S1 and F genes of the ACoV and APMV1, respectively. This screen yielded a 5.4% (16 out of 297) and 1.7% (5 out of 297) positive samples for ACoV and APMV1, respectively among all tested tracheal and faecal/cloacal samples. Among positive samples for APMV1, a single isolate shown high genetic similarity to a vaccine strain whereas two out of 16 ACoV shown vaccine-alike characteristics. Pathotyping of the APMV1 isolate (NDV/Teal/VRLCU-EG/2015) showed MDT (96 h) and ICPI (0.4375) characteristics for lentogenic strains of NDV.",

A set of sequences, representing previously reported APMV1 and ACoV genotypes in Egyptian poultry sectors were aligned with sequences presented in this study using the ClustalW algorithm in BioEdit [17] . Comparison of nucleotide identity percentages revealed that one APMV1 isolate was genetically identical to the genotype II (vaccine strains genotype) with 100% identity to the commercial LaSota vaccine strain (Fig. 1A) whereas the other four isolates showed F protein cleavage site motif ( 112 RRQKRF 117 ) which is characteristic for velogenic strains of NDV. In addition, phylogenetic analysis based on full-length F gene revealed that clustered of these isolates within class II, genotype VII and specifically within subgenotype VIId, which is the most predominant genotype within Egyptian poultry sectors. However, the two ACoV isolates were closely related to the classic genotype of Massachusetts (MA5) serotype. The ACoV/Crow/Q alubia-Egypt/VRLCU-15/2015 and ACoV/House sparrow/Kafr El Sheikh-Egypt/VRLCU-16/2015 showed 100% and 93% identity to previously reported isolates from commercial poultry (IBV/ck/Egy pt/12vir6109-78/2012 and commercially available MA5 vaccine, respectively (Fig. 1B) ). Likewise, the amino acid identity comparison indicated several point mutations, which were prominent within ACoV/House sparrow/Kafr El Sheikh-Egypt/VRLCU-16/2015 isolate compared to MA5 vaccine strain. Briefly, these substitutions include Q242E, N250S, T257K, H264Y, E266V, G268D, N270T, N278T, T281L, Q285H, N308D and I338L. Genetic relatedness analysis for the other 14 ACoV isolates demonstrated the clustering of nine isolates (9/14, 64.3%) within Egy/variant 2 (IS/885 genotype) and five isolates (5/14, 35.7%) within Egy/variant 1 (IS/1494/06 genotype) of GI-23 Middle East lineage.",

The continuous fluctuations in mutant viruses caused by host immune system or environmental factors lead to tissue and host switches with altered pathogenicity and virulence. Especially for viruses with broader host range such as influenza and APMV, poor vaccination may help the host survival but these don't prevent the spread of the virus and thus resulting in the evolution of virulent viruses which may predispose the nearby life. Live attenuated vaccines, being used for several avian viruses including APMV1 and ACoV, are stable in poultry litter [20] and thus sub-standard biosecurity measures and practices can facilitate the transmission of these viruses to wild birds that may come in close contact with vaccinated poultry or nearby farms.",

Given the number of APMV1 vaccines (n = 12 in Egypt only such as LaSota, Clone 30 and Avinew) and ACoV vaccines (n = 8 in Egypt only including MA5, H120 and 4/91) being applied in the field, these viruses are yet major threat in the industry. Thus most attentions of diagnostic laboratories have been to identify pathogenic or virulent isolates whereas avirulent strains are potentially ignored. Although our data do not allow for the identification of the direct sources of APMV1 and ACoV infection for the wild birds, it is reasonable to suggest that these wild bird isolates originated from recent spillover of live APMV1 and ACoV vaccines, instead of representing strains that naturally circulate in these birds. Spillover of APMV1 and ACoV vaccines into wild birds reflects the most commonly used live vaccines. In addition, LaSota is the most commonly used APMV1 vaccine [22] and is more likely to be shed in the environment.",

Proper mitigation of these factors will not only increase the wild-domesticated interface but will also alleviate the disease and stress burdens on wild-life. In conclusion, further studies are required to evaluate ecological impacts of transmission of vaccines or infectious agents from poultry operations into free-ranging avifauna. Since the identified APMV-1 and ACoV isolates from wild birds were closely related to the currently used commercial vaccines in the Egyptian poultry sectors, the extensive use of vaccines poses possible threat into wildlife. Intensified surveillance of wild birds is an important means of assessing the relative prevalence of avian vaccine strains, and this knowledge would aid risk assessments, and disease management. Moreover, our findings are fundamental to assess the poor biosecurity measures, possible threats for virus evolution in these asymptomatic birds, and the impact of such spillover on the ecology and survival of wild birds and provide insights into the reverse spillover of avian viral vaccine strains in wild birds, which are considered reservoirs for these viruses. These findings highlight the need to fully investigate the dynamics and spectrum of vaccine-derived viral strains in the wild birds. Such investiga-tions would be helpful to ameliorate the welfare of wild birds and may reduce the possible virus evolution in potentially asymptomatic hosts. Likewise, bio-security measures should be enhanced to reduce the escape of vaccine strains to wild birds and disease transmission from domesticated to wild birds and vice versa.",

(A) Phylogenetic tree based on complete sequences of the F gene, showing the relationship between the commercial NDV vaccines (genotype I and II) and the circulating Egyptian genotypes (genotype VII) in commercial poultry sectors in relation to APMV1 isolates from wild birds reported in this study. (B) Phylogenetic tree based on partial sequences of the S1 gene, indicating the relationship between the commercially used vaccines (Mass like strains, MA5) and currently circulating Egyptian genotypes (IS/885 and IS/1494/06) in commercial poultry sectors. The robustness of individual nodes of the tree was assessed using 1000 replications of bootstrap re-sampling of the originally aligned nucleotide sequences. Scale bar represents the number of substitutions per site. The year of isolation and geographical origin of the virus sequences are included in the tree. (C) Distribution of negative and positive selection motifs along the HVR3 region of ACoV strains. Accumulated dN-dS are shown that are spanning amino acid residues from 238 to 342. (D) Distribution of negative and positive selection motifs along the F protein of the NDV strain sequenced in this study. Accumulated dN-dS are shown which are spanning the amino acid residues from 1 to 552.",
