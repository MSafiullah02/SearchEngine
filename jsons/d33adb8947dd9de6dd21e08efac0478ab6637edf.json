In recent decades TB incidence and mortality have been steadily declining, reflecting ongoing improvements in diagnosis, treatment and prevention 7 . However, in March 2020 a rapid analysis conducted by the Stop TB Partnership brought attention to severe impacts of COVID-related lockdowns on TB care in different countries 8 . For example, in the weeks following the imposition of a nationwide lockdown on March 24, 2020, India reported an 80% drop in daily notifications of TB 8 relative to average pre-lockdown levels. Such declines, likely reflecting reductions in access to diagnosis and treatment, could have a lasting impact on TB burden at a country-wide level. Missed diagnoses would mean increased opportunities for transmission, while worsened treatment outcomes increase the risk of death from TB. Therefore, while lockdowns are an important measure to mitigate the immediate impact of COVID-19, it is critical to anticipate (i) the potential long-term impact of these measures on TB and other diseases, and (ii) how this impact might be stemmed, in the short term, by appropriately targeted investment and effort. We therefore aimed to examine these questions using mathematical modelling of TB transmission dynamics. Building on earlier modelling conducted for the 2019 Lancet Commission on Tuberculosis 9,10 , we modelled the potential TBrelated impact of COVID-related lockdowns -and mitigating effects of potential post-lockdown interventions -in three focal countries: India, the Republic of Kenya, and Ukraine.",

During a lockdown, movement restrictions would curtail opportunities for those experiencing TB symptoms to seek care. Even once these people are able to visit a provider or health facility, the diagnostic and laboratory capacity needed to support TB diagnosis may be severely reduced -for example, with molecular diagnostic tools for TB being repurposed for COVID-19 17 or TB laboratory staff being redirected to Covid-19 efforts. National TB programmes are investing significant effort to continue supporting those already on TB treatment, but there are also concerns that lockdown conditions may interfere with the continued supply of drugs 18 . To capture this range of possible disruptions, we performed a rapid consultation amongst experts at the Stop TB Partnership and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Table 1 lists those experts' consensus opinion as to the degree to which TB services could be disrupted by COVID-related lockdowns, at each step of the care cascade. There is substantial uncertainty around these possible impacts, and as described below, we performed sensitivity analysis to identify which components of disruptions would have the greatest impact on overall TB burden.",

This process may be delayed if, for example, laboratory capacity for diagnosis needs time to be reconstituted for TB, or indeed if there remains a reluctance to seek care amongst those with TB symptoms, as a consequence of fear and stigma caused by the Covid 19 pandemic. Accordingly, to model the impact of the lockdown and its aftermath, we assumed two phases: a lockdown of given duration, during which all impacts listed in Table 1 are in full effect, followed by a 'restoration' period, during which TB services are gradually (for simplicity, linearly) restored to normal. We also assumed that TB transmission would revert to normal at the same time as lifting the lockdown, as a result of contact rates in the community rapidly being restored to normal (although see below for sensitivity analysis). This assumption may be appropriate in high-burden, low-income settings where physical distancing is less feasible than in high-income settings, but also where there are strong economic incentives to restore livelihoods as soon as possible. We present results for two scenarios: a 'moderate' scenario consisting of a 2-month lockdown followed by a 2-month .

On the basis of these calibrations, following a moderate lockdown we projected that between 2020 and 2025, in India there would be an increase of 473,000 TB cases (95% Bayesian credible interval (CrI) 429 -529 thousand) and 130,000 TB deaths (95% CrI 120 -142 thousand). Likewise, in Kenya there would be an additional 12,200 cases (95% CrI 8,570 -18,200) and 4,550 deaths (95% CrI 3,230 -5,960), and in Ukraine an additional 2,630 cases (95% CrI 2,120 -3,300) and 676 deaths (95% CrI 536 -781) (see Figures 1 and 2, and Table 2 ). Overall, this excess burden translates to a 1 -4% increase across countries in TB incidence, and 2 -6% in TB deaths, between 2020 and 2025. Both estimates of adverse impact were projected to increase by three-to four-fold in the case of a severe, rather than moderate, lockdown ( Table 2 ). In terms of the monthly dynamics, Figures 1 and 2 illustrate that increases in mortality would be greater proportionally than increases in incidence, but would also recover more rapidly than incidence upon restoration of normal TB services. Increases in incidence lasted far beyond the period of disruption; for example, in India, incidence was projected to remain at least 4% higher than a \"business-as-usual\" baseline for a period of 32 months, even in the moderate scenario of a two-month lockdown followed by two-month restoration ( Figure  S5 ).",

This additional analysis highlights that short-term increases in TB mortality are likely to occur whatever the effect of the lockdown on transmission, since these increases in mortality are driven by build-ups in undetected TB, rather than by transmission. On the other hand, long-term incidence can be affected by different scenarios for transmission. In particular, when assuming that transmission takes 4 months to return to normal (right-hand panels of Figure S7 ), a moderate lockdown scenario represents an example where TB services are restored more rapidly (i.e. within 2 months) than TB transmission, and a severe scenario represents the converse (i.e. service restoration within 10 months).

This expanded pool of undetected TB continues to seed new infections of latent TB, many of which would take years to manifest as incident TB disease. Consequently, service disruptions give rise to a short-term escalation of TB mortality (Figure 2 ), followed by a prolonged increase in incidence that could take years to undo (Figure 1 ).",

In practice, such supplementary measures could involve active case-finding 20,21 , including contact tracing with longitudinal followup 22 . On the patient side, COVID-19 and pulmonary TB are both associated with respiratory symptoms. If, during the current pandemic, COVID-19 comes to be seen as a \"TB-like\" disease, public recognition of the importance of recognising TB symptoms may wane once COVID-19 is thought to be under control. Additional efforts may therefore be needed to address these misperceptions. An additional concern is that COVID-19 may carry stigma in many communities, and this stigma may transfer to individuals with TB as well 23 . Conversely, there may be opportunities to leverage synergies between the two diseases; for example, integrated TB and COVID-19 screening and testing algorithms or combined contact investigation strategies. Any such strategies based on respiratory symptoms could use similar infrastructure and staff to mitigate both the direct impacts of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and the indirect effects of augmented M. tuberculosis transmission. In short, readiness to restore TB services as rapidly as possible, combined with focused efforts to 'catch up' on missed diagnoses, will be critical in limiting any long-term setback to TB care efforts as a result of the COVID-19 response.",

We have assumed that a lockdown would reduce transmission by 10%, and moreover that transmission would revert to normal as soon as a lockdown is lifted. These assumptions reflect expert opinion for the implementation of lockdowns in low-and middle-income settings, but carry substantial uncertainty. As illustrated by Section 3 in the supporting information, which tests both of these assumptions, it is likely that short-term increases in TB mortality would be unaffected by alternative scenarios. This is because both factors do little to address the problem of undetected TB, that accumulates during a lockdown. However, our estimates for long-term incidence trends may be affected by alternative scenarios for transmission. In general, the risk of long-term increases in incidence are greatest if community contact rates return to normal at a faster rate than TB services ( Figure S7 ). Overall, therefore, this sensitivity analysis underlines the practical implications of our analysis: that it is critical to restoring routine TB services as rapidly as possible, alongside 'catch-up' campaigns immediately upon lifting a lockdown.",

For example, early evidence suggests that existing TB infection, whether latent or active, can be a strong risk factor for severe disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection 26 .

Our model therefore does not capture the potential TB implications of disruptions in HIV care, and for this reason may be conservative. Lockdowns are likely to reduce community transmission but at the expense of intensifying and prolonging household and congregate setting exposure. Faithfully capturing household contact structure is generally not feasible in compartmental models such as in the current analysis, and instead we have taken a simple approach of an assumed overall net reduction in transmission.

As our models do not incorporate household vs community structure, these scenarios instead aim to capture the net effect of changes in household vs community transmission. In urban slums in particular, where TB transmission is strongest, overcrowding may tend to reduce the effect of any lockdown on community transmission. In section 3 in the supporting information, we present corresponding sensitivity analyses to these assumptions. 3 The initial patient delay is an assumed interval of active, infectious TB, prior to a patient's first presentation for care. It is calibrated to match epidemiological data (see Table S1 for data, and Tables S4 -S6 for parameter estimates). 4 For simplicity, only the Kenya model incorporates the role of HIV/TB coinfection, which is estimated to account for 27% of incident TB.
