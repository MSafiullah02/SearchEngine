As we remain mired in the depths of the coronavirus pandemic, collecting all the information we can about the virus and how it spreads is the imperative at hand as experts around the globe seek to limit the already devastating consequences of Covid-19. While our thoughts and hopes go out to all those affected by this crisis, perhaps it is time to reflect on one of the more controversial issues frequenting the pages of so many journals in our field over the past 10 years. JARG has been no different from our sister publications in meeting the challenges posed by the field of genetic testing, especially in the context of what we now refer to as PGT-A.",

What emerges is an acknowledgement of the rightful place PGT-A has assumed in clinical practice in sharp contradistinction to the advances made in the basic biology underlying early human development. Any worthwhile information gathering effort aimed at diagnosing, treating, and managing our common cause of infertility should in the end bring a sense of pause and reflection on what we have learned that we may not have known before.",

The centerpiece upon which much of our understanding is based is understandably the chromosome [1]. And through it all, testing for chromosomes, mutations, and many unanticipated genomic variations on the theme brought the relevance of our genetic inheritance in normal and disease states to the forefront of human ARTs in an era that witnessed the arrival of a plurality of gametes and embryos. The hard choices of what gamete pairs or embryos would become a child now rested firmly in the hands of ART practitioners.",

For example, Adashi and McCoy drew attention to the prevalence of zygotic mitotic errors and their mosaic nature relative to the well-known zygotic penetrance exhibited by errors during meiosis [2] . Moreover, many of the peculiarities of cell behavior noted through the application of time lapse imaging of human embryos, exposed on a broad scale deviations in cell cycle progression and cell division behaviors once reserved for the most abnormal of cells within tumors [3]. Based on several years of imaging mammalian embryo behavior, with great spatial and temporal precision, we now know with a measure of certainty the these behaviors are not unique to human embryos but rather represent measures of great plasticity and dynamism during the initial cell cycles of human development deviating from the norm of what somatic cells would be expected to do [4].",

Add to recognition of the prevalence of mosaicism the many mechanism now appreciated to generate this and other forms of genetic diversity not adhering to the laws of Mendelian inheritance [6], like meiotic drivers [8], and we are left with a sense of gratitude for what ARTs has contributed to our evolving understanding of the complexities of early human development.",
