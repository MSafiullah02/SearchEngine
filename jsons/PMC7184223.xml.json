This practice rose from an earlier proposal [5]to use the name \u201cretinoids\u201d collectively for both natural forms and synthetic analogues of vitamin A that are capable of preventing the development of cancer. General use of this term is, however, misleading for two reasons. Firstly, the customary practice gives the name \u201cretinoids\u201d, which has an agreed definition based on chemical structure [3], to a class of compounds defined by their biological activity. Secondly, many synthetic members of this class of compounds, the so-called \u201carotinoids\u201d [9] or \u201cretinoidal benzoic acid derivatives\u201d [10] as well as others, are not chemically retinoids.

It has the advantage that it is written in terms of sums of species and leads directly to the expression for the apparent equilibrium constant K\u2032:K\u2032=[acetyl phosphate][ADP][ATP][acetate] which is a function of pH and magnesium ion concentration, as well as T, P and ionic strength.

In view of such difficulties, the panel has recommended that all indications of charges be removed from biochemical equations and that the full chemical equations, which are written in terms of individual species which may be charged (e.g. H+, Mg2+, RCOO\u2212, etc.) should be used for those specific cases where thermodynamic behaviour is to be considered.",

Failure to make such a clear distinction can lead to hybrid equations that do not have corresponding equilibrium constant expressions and have incorrect stoichiometry. For example, the hydrolysis of 1 mol of ATP to ADP at approximately pH 7 does not produce 1 mol of H+, as suggested by the equation: ATP+H2O=ADP+phosphate+H+ but about 0.6 mol.

Chemical equations that do balance hydrogen ions, bound metal ions and charges can be written for these reactions and their equilibrium-constant expressions yield the equilibrium constant K, which is independent of pH and concentrations of free metal ions.

If the number of protons produced or consumed in a reaction at pH 7 is of special interest, e.g. as it may be for nitrogenase, a comment to this effect may be added.(2)NAD(P) and NAD(P)H2 should replace NAD(P)+ and NAD(P)H + H+. The alternative symbols NADox and NADred were recommended but these have the disadvantage of not showing that the oxidation/reduction reaction is a two-electron change, for example in the reaction:Alcohol+NAD=aldehyde+NADH2 If it is necessary to indicate an oxidation/reduction reaction where the acceptor/donor is unknown, reduced acceptor/oxidized acceptor (or Acceptorred/Acceptorox) should be used. Alternatively 2e may be used to represent a reactant in a two-electron transfer.(3)When CO2 is produced, CO2 can be used in writing biochemical equations if it is understood that it is produced in the gas phase. Otherwise carbonate should be used to represent the sum of the species CO2, H2CO3, HCO3\n\u2212, and CO3\n2\u2212 in the solution. The term TotCO2 may be used as an alternative to make this clearer.(4)Ammonia should replace NH3 or NH4\n+ in describing the sum of NH4\n+ and dissolved NH3+H2O=NH4OH.(5)Cyanide should replace CN\u2212 or HCN (e.g. in EC 4.4.1.9) as it represents the sum of both of these species.(6)Nitrite and nitrate should replace NO2\n\u2212 and NO3\n\u2212, respectively.(7)Ascorbic acid (d-erythro-ascorbic acid) should be replaced by ascorbate (d-erythro-ascorbate) to represent the sum of species.(8)Fe(II) should be used in place of Fe2+to represent the sum of various complexed species of the ferrous ion.\n",
