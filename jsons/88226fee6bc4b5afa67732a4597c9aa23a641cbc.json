            "text": "The camel industry uses traditional (i.e., iron brands and ear tags) and modern (i.e., microchips) identification (ID) systems without having performance results of reference. Previously ironbranded (n = 45; 1 yr) and microchipped (n = 59; 7 yr) camels showed problems of healing (8.6% of brands) and reading (only 42.9% of brands and 69.5% of microchips were readable), which made their use inadvisable. With the aim of proposing suitable ID systems for different farming conditions, an on-field study was performed using a total of 528 dromedaries at 4 different locations (Egypt, n = 83; Spain, n = 304; Saudi Arabia, n = 90; and Tunisia, n = 51). The ID devices tested were visual (button ear tags, 28.5 mm diameter, n = 178; double flag ear tags, 50 by 15 mm, n = 83; both made of polyurethane) and electronic (ear tags, n = 90, and rumen boluses, n = 555). Electronic ear tags were polyurethane-loop type (75 by 9 mm) with a container in which a 22-mm transponder of full-duplex technology was lodged. Electronic boluses of 7 types, varying in dimensions (50 to 76 mm length, 11 to 21 mm width, and 12.7 to 82.1 g weight) and specific gravity (SG; 1.49 to 3.86) and each of them containing a 31-mm transponder of half-duplex technology, were all administered to the dromedaries at the beginning of the study. When a low-SG bolus was lost, a high-SG bolus was readministered. Readability rates of each ID system were evaluated during 1 to 3 yr, according to device and location, and yearly values were estimated for comparison. On a yearly basis, visual ear tag readability was not fully satisfactory; it was lower for rectangular ear tags (66.3%) than for button ear tags (80.9%). Yearly readability of electronic ear tags was 93.7%. Bolus readability dramatically varied according to their SG; the SG < 2.0 boluses were fully lost after 8 mo. In contrast, the SG > 3.0 boluses were efficiently retained (99.6 to 100%) at all locations. In conclusion, according to the expected long lifespan of camels, low ID performances were observed for iron brands, injectable microchips, and ear tags (visual and electronic), making their use inadvisable as unique ID systems in camels. The high readability of dense electronic boluses recommended their use as a permanent ID device of reference in camels.",

            "text": "Worldwide, there are 27 million of the Old World camels (FAO, 2015) , where near 90% of them are dromedaries (Camelus dromedarius L.) or Arabian camels, spreading all over the arid flat lands between the 0 and 40\u00b0N (from the Canary Islands to Rajasthan) and the 20 and 30\u00b0S (Australian deserts) parallels. Camels are culturally reverenced and economically appreciated by their strategic values (i.e., milk, meat, draft, manure, hair, and hides), but there are also some concerns related to their overgrazing (El-Keblawy et al., 2009 ) and feral herds (Dennis et al., 2010) and to endemic (Fassi-Fehri, 1987 ) and emergent diseases (e.g., Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; Chu et al., 2014) . Dromedaries show a long lifespan (approximately 30 yr) and few distinctive coat traits, making a necessity to use the artificial marks for individual identification (ID). Traditional camel ID is based on the use of clan or family symbols (\"wasm\" or \"lealama\" in Arabic) engraved by red iron brands on visible body sites (e.g., cheek, neck, thigh). However, branding is questioned today for welfare reasons and is inadequate for modern ID and traceability standards. Modernization of livestock farms led to the adoption of ID devices (Caja et al., 2004) such as visual (e.g., brands, tattoos, ear tags, and collars) and electronic (e.g., injectables, ear tags, and boluses). Despite the sedentarization of herds and the creation of intensive dairy farms (Faye et al., 2012) , little attention has been paid to camel ID and traceability. Camels are absent from the terrestrial animal health code of the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE, 2016) , the Codex Alimentarius (WHO-FAO, 2016) , or the guidelines of ICAR (2016). Camel ID is only regulated in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi based on the use of radio-frequency identification (RFID) injectable transponders or microchips (ADFCA, 2010) . To our knowledge, however, there are no studies evaluating the performance of different ID devices in camels. Therefore, the aim of this research was to compare the performances of using visual vs. electronic camel ID systems in a wide range of geographical locations and different farming conditions.",

On the other hand, having the concern of residues in camel meat for human consumption, we considered a unique opportunity to report the mid-term performances of microchips already injected by a veterinarian in a group of riding dromedaries in Spain. Moreover, the unsatisfactory readability results observed for both iron brands and microchips motivated the interest for testing alternative ID systems. Time differences between types of ID devices were standardized on a yearly basis for comparison, and differences between means were separated by using a logit model with an estimation method of maximum likelihood. A more detailed analysis of the relation between treatments and ID performances was therefore not possible, but the explanation of the results was completed with relevant literature data and local experts' knowledge about dromedary husbandry.",

No differences between glass-and polymerencapsulated microchips were detected by L\u00f8ken et al. (2011) . The use of longer glass-encapsulated transponders (23 or 32 by 3.8 mm) in suitable body sites (ear scutulum and armpit) of fattening calves slaughtered at 8 to 12 mo by Conill et al. (2000) showed 93.0 to 98.5% readability, which differed according to body site and transponder size. When comparing our results of microchip readability of the long term (7 yr) in camels with short and mid term (0.5 to 2.1 yr) in horses and cattle, it is clear that the values of estimated yearly losses by using the Seroussi et al. (2011) expression in our camels (5.1%; Table 2 ) were consistent and within the range of those previously calculated in horses (0 to 13.7%) and cattle (1.8 to 8.4%).",

The World Small Animal Veterinary Association (2016) strongly recommended that any microchipped food-producing animal should carry an external ID to indicate that a microchip is present (i.e., to be recognized and recovered at slaughter) and in some cases their use may not be permitted. Conill et al. (2000) reported recovery times of approximately 1 min at the slaughterhouse when 23 and 32 mm transponders were injected in the ear base and armpit of fattening calves. The smaller size of RFID microchips used in camels (i.e., 12 to 15 mm, as in horses and pets), the uncertainty of their presence (i.e., high losses), and location difficulties (i.e., short reading distance) will compromise the safety of camel meat (i.e., neck) for consumers, making it not fully recommendable in the camel industry.",

There are few researches reporting vET readability in livestock, and their performances dramatically vary according to the species and the exploitation conditions. Edwards et al.

Fosgate et al. (2006) reported 87.6% of annual losses of plastic vET in a study on domestic water buffalo that lasted 3 yr under extensive conditions, with the overall median ear-tag retention being 272 d and the final retention zero, and they concluded that ear tags were inadequate for the long-term ID of buffaloes under extensive conditions. In the case of goats, Carn\u00e9 et al. (2009a) reported vET losses varying between 6.0 and 17.1% for official and unofficial (i.e., tip-tag ear tags) plastic vET in a 3-yr study. Moreover, Carn\u00e9 et al.

Comparatively, less than 60% of ear-tagged or microchipped camels would be identifiable after 10 yr and less than 30% after 25 yr, clearly showing the advantages of using eRB.",

            "text": "Agreeing with our conclusion, Moreki et al. (2012) reported that boluses were the most tamperproof and highly retained ID device in a study comparing different methods for cattle ID (i.e., vET, eET, and electronic boluses) under range-extensive conditions in Botswana. Additionally, Hentz et al. (2014) stated that boluses have advantages over ear tags in warm and hot climates (e.g., Brazil), as the internal devices (i.e., forestomach) reduce the risks of ear tag losses, tissue damage, and lesions on the ear. Nevertheless, the above-mentioned eRB4 to eRB7 had large dimensions (66.0 to 68.0 mm length and 16.9 to 21.1 mm diameter), which made their use inadvisable in young suckling camels. Therefore, these types of boluses should be used in camel calves older than 3 mo and heavier than 90 kg BW. The age is important for safe bolus administration, which depends on the anatomical development of the pharynx and esophagus and on the dimensions (length and diameter) of the eRB used (Carn\u00e9 et al., 2009a) . Despite the administration of eRB being possible during wk 1 of life, our advice for identifying young suckling camels is to administer small-sized boluses, such as the eRB2, when the calves have passed the perinatal period and look vigorous (e.g., after 1 to 2 wk of age and >50 kg BW). For weaners and adult camels, any of the eRB4 to eRB7 are recommended for the long-term ID under extensive and intensive conditions.",

Additionally, the low ID performances reported for the long term makes their use inadvisable as a reference system for the camel industry. The use of vET as a single ID device is also not recommended for the permanent ID of camels due to the high losses and elevated risk of ear breakages. Whatever the case, small-sized ear tags (e.g., button shape) or plastic-loop ear tags (e.g., eET) would be preferable to ear tags with large flags. The high readability of dense and adequately designed eRB in the long term and under different farming conditions makes their use the most recommendable as the ID device of reference for the permanent identification of camels. Nevertheless, like required by international regulations in other livestock species, the use of a second visual ID device might be suggested for an easy management in large farms of dairy dromedaries, although further studies are needed to confirm this recommendation.",
