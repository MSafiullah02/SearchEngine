Some of these proteins, such as the RNA-dependent RNA polymers, helicase and main protease, are well conserved between SARS-CoV-2 and the original SARS virus, but several others are not. This study examines one of the proteins encoded by SARS-CoV-2 that is most different, a macrodomain of nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3). Although 26% of the amino acids in this SARS-CoV-2 macrodomain differ from those seen in other coronaviruses, biochemical and structural data reveal that the protein retains the ability to bind ADP-ribose, which is an important characteristic of beta coronaviruses, and potential therapeutic target.",

Most of the proteins that form the viral replicase are encoded by the \"rep 1ab\" reading frame, which codes for a 7,096 amino acid-long polyprotein that is ultimately processed into at least 15 functional peptides, five of which are only produced by a translational frameshift event occurring after nsp10 (Fig. 1) . Parts of the SARS-CoV-2 rep 1ab polyprotein are very similar to the rep 1ab protein of the coronavirus that caused the SARS epidemic in 2003 (which will be referred to here as SARS-CoV-1), suggesting the that drugs targeting the SARS-CoV-1 nsp5-14 might be effective against SARS-CoV-2.

The most variation occurs in a domain of Nsp3 domain suspected to bind ADP-ribose, that will be referred to here as the \"macro X\" domain, to differentiate it from the two downstream \"SARS unique macrodomains (SUDs),\" which do not bind ADP-ribose. 3 The macro X domain of SARS-CoV-1 is also able to catalyze the hydrolysis of ADP-ribose 1'' phosphate, albeit at a slow rate. 4 All the above differences preclude the use of the SARS-CoV-1 macro X domain structures as scaffolds to design compounds that might target this nsp3 region in SARS-CoV-2, especially in light of the observation that the same nsp3 domain from gamma coronaviruses does not bind ADP-ribose in vitro. 5 Because ADP-ribose binding is a property that could be used to identify possible antiviral agents, the ability of the SARS-CoV-2 macro X domain to bind ADP-ribose was examined using a recombinant purified protein and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). We also determined the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 macro X domain in order to examine the biochemical context of ADP-ribose binding and to provide data for rational inhibitor design or in silico screening.",

To examine binding specificity, similar titrations were repeated with related nucleotides. The SARS-CoV-2 protein bound ADP, cAMP, ATP and ADP-glucose ( Fig. 3D ). All nucleotides lacking the ribose moiety bound with similar high affinities, but none bound with an enthalpy change like that seen with ADP-ribose, suggesting specific contacts form between ADP ribose the SARS-CoV-2 protein. Based on what is seen in the SARS-CoV-2 structures below, these contacts likely occur with the conserved D226 and N244 (positions 30 and 43 in the numbering above the alignment in Fig. 2) . None of the other nucleotides bind with an entropic penalty as seen with ADP-ribose, either, suggesting that the ribose moiety becomes structured when bound to the macrodomain.",

Their crystals also allowed binding of ADPribose (6W02) and AMP (6W6Y), while ours seemed to be packed too tightly to permit ligands to access the binding site (data not shown). We compared our ultrahigh-resolution model of the unliganded protein to the ADP-ribose-bound form. The RMSD values for the fitting, done by secondary structure matching (SSM) 23 as implemented in COOT, is 0.59 \u00c5 for 165 of 172 C\u03b1 atoms. This is very similar to the RMSD values of the free protein (6VXS; 0.66 \u00c5) and the AMP-bound form (6W6Y; 0.50 \u00c5), indicating that there are no large conformational changes that occur upon ligand binding. In fact, the only notable conformational changes occur in three surface-exposed loops in or near the ligand-binding pocket (Fig. 4C) . These loops connect strand \u03b2 2 with helix \u03b1 2 (the \u03b2 2-\u03b12 loop), strand \u03b2 4 with helix \u03b1 4 (\u03b24-\u03b14 loop), and strand \u03b2 5 with helix \u03b1 5 (\u03b25-\u03b15 loop). The subtle change in conformation of the \u03b2 4-\u03b14 loop (purple in Fig. 4C ) appears to be the result of crystal contacts and not the direct influence of ADP-ribose binding. The other two loops are more intimately involved in ligand binding. The main chain of the \u03b1 2-\u03b22 loop rotates 180\u00b0 in order to allow the amide N atom of G252 to participate in a hydrogen bonding interaction with the 1'-hydroxyl of the ribose moiety of ADPribose. This loop also carries N244, which directly interacts with the ribose. The phenyl ring of F336 in the \u03b2 5\u03b1 5 loop occupies the portion of the binding pocket in the unliganded structure that is occupied by the \u03b2 -phosphate of ADP-ribose. Thus, without a rearrangement of the \u03b2 5\u03b1 5 loop, ADP-ribose would not be able to bind.",

This is the first step needed to justify screens for potential antivirals that bind in place of ADP ribose. More work needs to be done, however, to understand the antiviral potential of such compounds because the biological role for ADP-ribose binding is still not fully understood. Some work with alpha coronaviruses suggest that ADP-ribose binding by the macro X domain is not needed for viral replication. 24 However, studies with other (+)RNA viruses suggest that macrodomains are essential for virulence. 25 This work is also noteworthy because the synthetic codonoptimized plasmid reported here produces up to 100 mg of soluble macro X domain protein per liter of E. coli culture, and this protein retains a high affinity for ADP ribose. The protein could be used for structural studies and screening campaigns. Screening assays with the SARS-CoV-2 protein might actually be more efficient, since the SARS-CoV-2 protein binds ADP-ribose somewhat more tightly (K d = 10 \u00b5M) than the SARS-CoV-1 protein (K d = 24 \u00b5M). The recombinant protein reported here, together with the detailed structural information, might also be useful to others developing SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics and/or therapeutics. ",

(A) Macro X domain structures were aligned using th \"MatchMaker\" function of UCSF Chimera (v. 1.14). 37 Amino acids are colored by class with beta sheets in green boxes a alpha helices in yellow boxes. The SARS-CoV-2 macro X domain binds ADP ribose. (A) 15% SDS PAGE showing 10 \u00b5L samples of: a soluble crude lysate of induced BL21(DE3) cells harboring the plasmid p21-COVID-MacroX (lane C), proteins the do not bind a Ni-NTA column (F), and fractions eluted from a Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid column during an imidazole step gradient from 0 mM (lanes 1-3), 5 mM (lanes 4-6), 40 mM (lanes 7-9), and 500 mM (lanes 10-12). Protein markers (lane M) are 116, 66.2, 45, 35, and 25 kDa. (B) Example ITC experiment in which purified SARS-CoV-2 nsp3 macro domain was titrated with ADP ribose. (C) ITC experiments like those shown in panel B were repeated three times with each of the compounds listed. Means are plotted and error bars are standard deviations. Average (\u00b1SD) dissociation constants were 10 \u00b1 4 \u00b5M for ADP-ribose, 8 \u00b1 9 \u00b5M for ADP, 3 \u00b1 3 \u00b5M for ATP, 6\u00b1 4 \u00b5M for ADP-glucose, 2 \u00b1 1 \u00b5M for cAMP, and 2 \u00b1 1 \u00b5M for adenosine.
