            "text": "In the long contest between humans and microbes, the years from mid\u2010century until 1992 marked a distinctive era. In those euphoric decades, there was a consensus that the decisive battle had been joined and that the moment was at hand to announce the final victory. Almost as if introducing the new period, the US Secretary of State George Marshall declared in 1948 that the world now had the means to eradicate infectious diseases from the earth. Marshall's view was by no means exceptional. For some, in the early postwar years, the triumphant vision applied primarily to a single disease. The heady goal arose first of all within the field of malariology, where the Rockefeller Foundation scientists Fred Soper and Paul Russell thought that they had discovered in DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) a weapon of such unparalleled power that it would enable the world to eliminate the ancient scourge forever. With premature confidence in 1955, Russell published Man's Mastery of Malaria (1), in which he envisaged a global spraying campaign that would free mankind from malaria \u2013 cheaply, rapidly, and without great difficulty. Rallying to Russell's optimism, the World Health Organization (WHO) adopted a global campaign of malaria eradication with DDT as its weapon of choice. The director of the campaign, Emilio Pampana, elaborated a one\u2010size\u2010fits\u2010all program of eradication through four textbook steps \u2013\u2018preparation, attack, consolidation, and maintenance\u2019 (2). Russell's followers Alberto Missiroli, the director of the postwar campaign in Italy, and George Macdonald, the founder of quantitative epidemiology, reasoned that so signal a victory over mosquitoes could be readily expanded to include the elimination of all other vector\u2010borne tropical diseases, ushering in what Missiroli called a contagion\u2010free Eden, where medicine would make man not only healthy but also happy (3, 4, 5).",

            "text": "If malariologists, who dominated the international public health community, launched the idea of the final conquest of infectious diseases, it rapidly developed into the prevailing orthodoxy. E. Harold Hinman, chief malariologist to the Tennessee Valley Authority and member of the WHO Expert Committee on Malaria, extrapolated from the conquest of malaria to the conquest of all contagion in his influential work World Eradication of Infectious Diseases (6). Aidan Cockburn, a distinguished epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins and advisor to the WHO, gave expression to this new creed in his revealingly titled work The Evolution and Eradication of Infectious Diseases (7). As Cockburn noted, \u2018\u201cEradication\u201d of infectious disease as a concept in public health has been advanced only within the past two decades, yet it is replacing \u201ccontrol\u201d as an objective\u2019 (7). Although not a single disease had yet been destroyed by his time of writing in 1962, Cockburn believed that the objective of eradication was \u2018entirely practical,\u2019 not just for individual illnesses but for the whole category of communicable diseases. Indeed, he argued, \u2018it seems reasonable to anticipate that within some measurable time, such as 100 years, all the major infections will have disappeared\u2019 (7). By that time, he explained, \u2018the major infections of today should have disappeared, and only remaining should be their memories in textbooks, and some specimens in museums. \u2026 With science progressing so rapidly, such an end\u2010point is almost inevitable, the main matter of interest at the moment is how and when the necessary actions should be taken\u2019 (8). Cockburn's timetable of total eradication by 2060 was, in fact, too slow for some. Just a decade later, in 1973, the Australian virologist and Nobel laureate Frank Macfarlane Burnet went so far as to proclaim, together with his colleague David White, that \u2018at least in the affluent West,\u2019 the grand objective had already been reached. \u2018One of the immemorial hazards of human existence has gone,\u2019 he reported, because there is a \u2018virtual absence of serious infectious disease today\u2019 (9). The WHO also saw the entire planet as ready to enter the new era by the end of the century. Meeting at Alma Ata in 1979, the World Health Assembly adopted the goal of \u2018Health for All, 2000\u2019 (10).",

In the industrialized West, rates of mortality and morbidity from infectious diseases began to plummet in the second half of the 19th century, in large part as a result of \u2018social uplift\u2019\u2013 dramatic improvements in wages, housing, diet, and education. At the same time, developed nations erected the solid fortifications of sanitation and public health: sewers, drains, sand filtration, and chlorination of water as defenses against cholera and typhoid; sanitary cordons, quarantine, and isolation against bubonic plague; vaccination against smallpox; and the first effective \u2018magic bullet\u2019\u2013 quinine \u2013 against malaria. Meanwhile, improvements in the handling of food, pasteurization, retort canning, and the sanitation of seafood beds, yielded major advances against bovine tuberculosis (TB), botulism, and a variety of food\u2010borne maladies.",

Science, however, soon added new and powerful weapons. The foundational work of Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch had established the biomedical model of disease that promoted unprecedented understanding and yielded a cascade of scientific discoveries and new sub\u2010specialties (microbiology, immunology, parasitology, and tropical medicine). The dawn of the antibiotic era with penicillin and streptomycin provided means to treat syphilis, staph infections, and TB. The development of a series of vaccines dramatically lowered the incidence of smallpox, pertussis, diphtheria, tetanus, rubella, measles, mumps, and polio. DDT seemed to furnish a means to abolish malaria and other insect\u2010borne pathogens. By the 1950s, therefore, scientific discoveries had provided effective weapons against many of the most prevalent infectious diseases. Extrapolating from such dramatic developments, many concluded that it was reasonable to expect that communicable diseases could be eliminated one at a time until the vanishing point was reached. Indeed, the worldwide campaign against smallpox provided just such an example when the WHO announced in 1979 that the disease had become the first ever to be eradicated by intentional human action.",

            "text": "Those who asserted the doctrine of the conquest of infection viewed the microbial world as largely static or only very slowly evolving. For that reason, there was little concern that the victory over existing infections would be challenged by the appearance of new diseases for which humanity was unprepared and immunologically naive. Falling victim to historical amnesia, they ignored the fact that the last 500 years even in the West had been punctuated by the appearance of a series of catastrophic new diseases: bubonic plague in 1347, syphilis in the 1490s, cholera in 1830, Spanish influenza in 1918\u20131919. Macfarlane Burnet in this regard was typical. Burnet was a founding figure in evolutionary medicine who acknowledged, in theory, the possibility of the emergence of new diseases as a result of mutation. But, in practice, he believed that such appearances are infrequent and that they occur only at such distant intervals as to occasion little concern. \u2018There may,\u2019 he wrote, \u2018be some wholly unexpected emergence of a new and dangerous infectious disease, but nothing of the sort has marked the last fifty years\u2019 (9). The notion of microbial fixity, that the diseases that we have are the ones that we will face, even underpinned the International Health Regulations adopted in 1969 (IHR 1969), which specified that the three great epidemic killers of the 19th century were the only diseases requiring notification: plague, yellow fever, and cholera. The regulations gave no thought to what action would be required if an unknown but deadly and transmissible new microbe should appear (11, 12).",

            "text": "If belief in the stability of the microbial world was one of the major articles of faith underpinning the eradicationists' vision, a second misplaced evolutionary idea also played a crucial role. This was the doctrine that nature was fundamentally benign. Over time, eradicationists believed, the pressure of natural selection would drive all communicable diseases toward a decline in virulence. The principle was that excessively lethal infectious diseases would prevent their own transmission by prematurely destroying their hosts. The long\u2010term tendency, the proponents of victory asserted, is toward commensalism and equilibrium. New epidemic diseases are virulent almost by accident as a temporary maladaptation, and they therefore evolve toward mildness, ultimately becoming readily treatable diseases of childhood. Examples were the evolution of smallpox from variola major to variola minor; the transformation of syphilis from the fulminant \u2018great pox\u2019 of the 16th century into the slow\u2010acting disease of today; and the transformation of classic cholera into the far milder El Tor biotype. Similarly, the doctrine held a priori that, in the family of four diseases of human malaria, the most virulent, i.e. Falciparum malaria, was an evolutionary newcomer relative to the less lethal Vivax, Ovale, and Malariae malaria, which were believed to be older and to have evolved toward commensalism. Against this background, the standard textbook of internal medicine in the eradicationist era, the 7th edn of Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine of 1974, claimed that a feature of infectious diseases is that they \u2018as a class are more easily prevented and more easily cured than any other major group of diseases\u2019 (13, 14).",

            "text": "The most fully elaborated and most cited theory of the new era was the \u2018epidemiologic transition\u2019 or \u2018health transition\u2019 theory represented by Abdel Omran, professor of epidemiology at Johns Hopkins, in 1971 and refined by him in 1977 and 1983. Omran's theory of the transition was an account of the encounter of human societies with disease in the modern period. According to Omran and his followers in such journals as the Health Transition Review, humanity has passed through three eras of modernity in health and disease. Although Omran is ambiguous about the precise chronology of the first era, the \u2018age of pestilence and famine,\u2019 it is clear that it lasted until the 18th century in the West and was marked by Malthusian positive checks on demography: epidemics, famines, and wars. There followed the \u2018age of receding pandemics\u2019 that extended from the mid\u201018th century until the early 20th in the developed West and until later in non\u2010Western countries. During this period there was a declining mortality from infectious diseases in general and from TB in particular. Finally, after World War I in the West and after World War II in the rest of the globe, humanity entered the \u2018age of degenerative and man\u2010made diseases.\u2019 Whereas in the earlier stages of disease evolution, social and economic conditions played the dominant role in determining health and the risk of infection, in the final phase medical technology and science played a major part. In this period, mortality and morbidity from infectious diseases have been progressively replaced by the rise of degenerative diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, and metabolic disorders, by man\u2010made diseases such as occupational and environmental illnesses, and by accidents (15, 16, 17). Adopting the perspective of \u2018health transition\u2019 theory, US Surgeon General Julius B. Richmond announced in 1979 that infectious diseases were simply the \u2018predecessors\u2019 of the degenerative diseases that succeed and replace them. The course of nature, in his view, was simple, unidirectional, and benign (18).",

US Surgeon General William Steward reported in 1969 that the time had come to \u2018close the book on infectious diseases.\u2019 This view was profoundly Eurocentric. Even as medical experts in Europe and North America declared final victory, infectious diseases remained the leading cause of death worldwide, and nowhere more disastrously than in the poorest and most vulnerable countries of Africa, Asia, and Latin America. While the TB sanatoria were closing their doors in the developed North, the disease continued its ravages in the South. Indeed, the disease continued to ravage the marginalized underclasses of the North itself: the homeless, prisoners, intravenous drug users, immigrants, and racial minorities. As Paul Farmer has argued, TB was emphatically not disappearing; it was just that the bodies it affected were either distant or hidden from sight (19, 20). Indeed, in 2008 the best estimates suggest that there are more people ill with TB today than at any time in human history and that nearly two million will die of it during the course of the year (21, 22).",

Rather than witnessing the rapid fulfillment of the prediction that science and technology would eliminate all infectious diseases from the globe, the industrial West discovered that it remained painfully vulnerable and to a degree that had seemed unimaginable. The decisive event, of course, was the arrival and upsurge of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). AIDS was first recognized as a new disease entity in 1981, and its etiologic pathogen was identified in 1983. By the end of the decade, it was clear that HIV/AIDS embodied everything that the eradicationists had considered unthinkable. AIDS was a new infectious disease for which there was no cure, it reached the industrial world as well as developing countries, and it unleashed in its train a series of exotic additional opportunistic infections. Furthermore, it had the potential to become the worst pandemic in history as measured not only by mortality and suffering but also by its profound social, economic, and security consequences.",

Once raised by the IOM, the cry of alarm was taken up widely and almost immediately: by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which devised its own response to the crisis in 1994 and founded a new journal Emerging Infectious Diseases devoted to the issue; by the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) in 1995; and by 36 of the world's leading medical journals that agreed to take the unprecedented step by which each devoted a theme issue to emerging diseases in January 1996, which they proclaimed \u2018Emergent Diseases Month\u2019 (25, 26, 27).

Cholera claimed international attention because of the numbers of those it afflicted, even though it had a low case fatality rate if treated early. Plague demanded attention because of its all too familiar potential. Ebola, by contrast, did not inspire terror by giving rise to a major epidemic: it infected only 315 people between January and July 1995. Nor did it create fear because of historical memories of disaster since it was a new disease first recognized in 1976. Nevertheless, Ebola set off a tidal wave of fear \u2013 a \u2018modern nightmare\u2019 in the words of Le Monde\u2013 across the globe. The reasons were that it dramatically revealed the lack of preparedness of both industrial and developing nations to deal with a public health emergency. It ignited primordial western fears of the jungle and of untamed nature, and it fed on racial anxieties about \u2018darkest\u2019 Africa. As a result, a prominent aspect of the Kikwit outbreak was its capacity to generate what the Journal of Infectious Diseases termed \u2018extraordinary\u2019 and \u2018unprecedented\u2019 press coverage that amounted at times to the commercial \u2018exploitation\u2019 of human misery and a \u2018national obsession\u2019 (36). Descending onto the banks of the Kwilu River, the world's tabloids stressed in vivid hyperbole that Ebola was a zoonotic disease that had sprung directly from the jungles of Africa as a result of the encounter between native charcoal burners and monkeys and now threatened the West. In the revealing headline of The Daily Telegraph of Sydney, \u2018Out of the jungle a monster comes\u2019 (37). Even the most legitimate investigators, however, were disturbed to discover that Ebola had eluded public health attention for 12 weeks between the death of the index case on January 6 and the notification of the international community on April 10, despite the fact that the disease had left clusters of severely ill and dying patients in its train. With such a porous surveillance network in place, Ebola aroused the fear that it might spread unnoticed 500 km from Kikwit to Kinshasa, and then throughout the world by means of the Zairian capital's intercontinental airport. There the virus could be loaded on board as \u2018a ticking, airborne time bomb\u2019 (38). Most of all, however, the Kikwit outbreak commanded attention because Ebola is almost invariably fatal and because its course in the human body is excruciating, dehumanizing, and dramatic. Commenting on the scenes that he had observed in Zaire, the author Richard Preston explained on television at the height of the outbreak that the mortality rate among sufferers was 90% and that there was no known remedy or prophylactic.

At the same time, investment by private industry on the development of new vaccines and classes of antibiotics dried up, the training of health care workers failed to keep abreast of new knowledge, vaccine development and manufacture were concentrated in fewer laboratories, and the discipline of infectious diseases struggled to attract its aliquot share of research funds and of the best minds. At the nadir in 1992, the United States spent only $74 million for infectious disease surveillance as public health officials prioritized other concerns \u2013 chronic diseases, substance abuse, tobacco use, geriatrics, and environmental issues.

In addition, the theorists of emerging diseases argued that, unnoticed by the eradicationists, society since World War II had changed in ways that actively promoted the emergence and reemergence of epidemic diseases. One of the leading features most commonly cited was the impact of globalization in the form of the rapid mass movement of goods and populations. As William McNeill noted in Plagues and Peoples (14), the migration of people throughout history has been one of the most dynamic factors affecting the balance between microbes and man. Humans are permanently engaged in a kind of war in which the social and ecological conditions that they create exert powerful evolutionary pressure on micro\u2010parasites. By mixing gene pools and by providing access for microbes to populations of non\u2010immunes living in conditions in which the microbes thrive, globalization gave microorganisms a powerful advantage. In the closing decades of the 20th century and the early years of the 21st, the speed and scale of this phenomenon amounted to a quantum leap, as 2.1 billion passengers boarded airplanes in 2006 (31, 42). In the words of the popular press, the daily movement of people around the globe by airplane means that a disease breaking out today in Kikwit can arrive in New York, Mumbai, and Mexico City tomorrow. The numbers of voluntary travelers, moreover, are massively supplemented by millions of involuntary refugees and displaced persons in flight from warfare, famine, and religious, ethnic, or political persecution. For Lederberg and the IOM, these rapid mass movements have tilted the advantage in favor of microbes, \u2018defining us as a very different species from what we were 100 years ago. We are enabled by a different set of technologies. But despite many potential defenses \u2013 vaccines, antibiotics, diagnostic tools \u2013 we are intrinsically more vulnerable than before, at least in terms of pandemic and communicable diseases\u2019 (43).",

Its hallmark has been wholesale, chaotic, and unplanned urbanization, led by the resource\u2010poor nations of sub\u2010Saharan Africa, which is the most rapidly urbanizing region on the planet (44). The results have been escalating poverty, widening social inequality, the birth of \u2018megacities\u2019 exceeding 10 million inhabitants, and the spawning of teeming peri\u2010urban slums without sanitary, educational, or other infrastructures.

Until 1950, however, dengue infections in any geographical area were caused by a single virus that gave rise to a painful illness marked by fever, rash, headache behind the eyes, vomiting, diarrhea, prostration, and joint pains so severe that the infection earned its nickname \u2018break\u2010bone fever.\u2019 But \u2018classical\u2019 dengue was a self\u2010limiting disease that was followed by lifelong immunity. The movement and mobility of populations, however, have allowed all four serotypes to spread indiscriminately around the globe, so that for the first time individuals who have already experienced infection with one dengue virus can subsequently be infected with one or more of the others, as there is no crossover immunity from one serotype to another. Through mechanisms that are still imperfectly understood, the disease is much more severe in patients suffering re\u2010infections with different serotypes. Instead of becoming milder, therefore, dengue has become a growing threat, giving rise to far more frequent outbursts and to sudden, devastating epidemics in which large numbers of patients suffer the severe and often lethal complications of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) that were once unknown.",

Dengue therefore demonstrates the following important evolutionary lessons: (i) infectious diseases that do not depend on the mobility of their host for transmission (because they are vector\u2010borne, waterborne, or foodborne) are not under selective pressure to become less virulent; (ii) overpopulated and unplanned urban or peri\u2010urban slums provide ideal habitats for microbes and their arthropod vectors; and (iii) modern transportation and the movements of tourists, migrants, refugees, and pilgrims facilitate the process by which microbes and vectors gain access to these ecological niches.",

Already in his 1945 Nobel Prize acceptance speech, Alexander Fleming, who discovered penicillin, the first antibiotic, issued a prophetic warning. Penicillin, he advised, needed to be administered with care, because the bacteria susceptible to it were likely to develop resistance. The selective pressure of so powerful a medicine would make it inevitable. Echoing Fleming's warning, the emerging diseases theorists argue that antibiotics are a \u2018non\u2010renewable resource\u2019 whose duration of benefit is biologically limited. By the late 20th century, this prediction was reaching fulfillment. On the one hand, the discovery of new classes of antimicrobials had slowed to a trickle, especially in a market in which profit margins are compressed by competition, by regulations requiring large and expensive clinical trials before approval, and by the low tolerance for risk on the part of regulatory agencies charged with the safety of the public. On the other hand, while anti\u2010infective development stagnates, many microorganisms have evolved extensive resistance. As a result, in one telling metaphor, physicians are rapidly emptying their quiver, and the world stands poised to enter the postantibiotic era (51). Some of the most troubling examples of the emergence of resistant microbial strains are the emergence of plasmodia that are resistant to all synthetic antimalarials, of S. aureus that is resistant both to penicillin and to methycillin (MRSA), and of strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis that are resistant not only to first\u2010line medications (MDR\u2010TB) but to second\u2010line medications as well (XDR\u2010TB) (52).

As a Rand Corporation study (53) notes, there are tens of thousands of viruses and 300 000 species of bacteria that are capable of infecting human beings, and many of them replicate and evolve billions of times in the course of a single human generation. Evolutionary pressures, in this context, work to the long\u2010term disadvantage of human beings. But unwise human actions have dramatically hastened the process. Farmers spray crops with pesticides and fruit trees with antibiotics, and they add subtherapeutic doses of antibiotics such as virginiamycin and avoparcin wholesale to animal feed to prevent disease, promote growth, and increase the productivity of chickens, pigs, and feedlot cattle. Indeed, half the world output of antimicrobials by tonnage is used in agriculture (54). At the same time, the popular confidence that microorganisms will succumb to a chemical barrage has led to a profusion of antimicrobials in domestic settings where they serve no purpose (55). Physicians, pressured to give priority in clinical settings to the immediate risk of individual patients over the long\u2010term interest of the species and to meet patients' expectations, have succumbed to profligate prescribing fashions, administering antibiotics even for non\u2010bacterial conditions for which they are unnecessary or entirely useless. The classic case in this regard is the pediatric treatment of otitis media (or middle ear infection), for which the overwhelming majority of practitioners in the 1990s prescribed antibiotics, even though two\u2010thirds of the children derived no benefit from the medication. Widespread possibilities of self\u2010medication in countries with few regulations or through opportunities created by the internet amplify the difficulties. In the case of diseases such as malaria and TB that require a long and complicated therapeutic regimen, there is also the issue of patients who interrupt their treatment after the alleviation of their symptoms instead of persevering until their condition is cured. Here the problem is not the overuse but the underuse of antibiotics. Sometimes described as simple non\u2010compliance by patients, the issue in fact raises complex questions of education, poverty, and lack of access to health care.

Infectious diseases, it became clear during the 1990s, are a more expansive category than scientists previously realized because many diseases long considered non\u2010infectious in fact have infectious origins. In demonstrating these causal connections, the decisive work was that of the Australian Nobel laureates Barry J. Marshall and Robin Warren with regard to peptic ulcers in the 1980s. Peptic ulcers are a significant cause of suffering, cost, and even death, as one American in 10 develops one during the course of a life time, over one million people are hospitalized by them every year, and 6000 die. Marshall noted in his acceptance speech for the Nobel Prize in 2005, however, that the chronic etiology of peptic ulcer in the 1980s was universally accepted as scientific truth. In his words, \u2018I realized that the medical understanding of ulcer disease was akin to a religion. No amount of logical reasoning could budge what people knew in their hearts to be true. Ulcers were caused by stress, bad diet, smoking, alcohol and susceptible genes. A bacterial cause was preposterous.\u2019 What Marshall and Warren were able to demonstrate, therefore, was a medical watershed. They proved, in part by means of an auto\u2010experiment, that the bacterium Helicobacter pylori was the infectious cause of the disease and that antibiotics rather than diet, lifestyle change, and surgery were the appropriate therapy (56). This insight led to the realization that many other non\u2010acute diseases, such as certain forms of cancer, chronic liver disease, and neurological disorders, are due to infections. Human papillomavirus, for instance, is thought to give rise to cervical cancer, hepatitis B and C viruses to chronic liver disease, Campylobacter jejuni to Guillain\u2010Barr\u00e9 syndrome, and certain strains of Escherichia coli to renal disease (57, 58). There are indications as well that infections serve as an important trigger to atherosclerosis and arthritis, and there is a growing recognition that epidemics and the fear that accompanies them leave psychological sequelae in their wake, including posttraumatic stress (59, 60). This understanding of these processes is what some have termed a new awareness of the \u2018infectiousness of non\u2010infectious diseases\u2019 (61).",

US or European military forces deployed abroad in support of humanitarian or other operations would be at high risk.

In so doing, it envisaged even more somber probabilities than the CIA in the new global environment. The Rand Corporation intelligence report The Global Threat of New and Reemerging Infectious Diseases: Reconciling U.S. National Security and Public Health Policy (53) had two leading themes. The first was that in the postwar era there was a sharp decline in the importance of direct military threats to security. The second was that there is a corresponding rise in the impact of \u2018non\u2010traditional challenges,\u2019 of which diseases are the major but inadequately recognized component.

As the report explained, \u2018The contemporary HIV/AIDS crisis in South Africa represents an acute example of how infectious diseases can undermine national resilience and regional stability.\u2019 In absolute numbers, South Africa has the highest number of HIV\u2010positive inhabitants in Africa \u2013 4.7 million people in 2000, or 25% of the country's adult population. Already, such extreme prevalence of the disease has pervasive impacts, affecting all aspects of South African security. But South Africa is just emerging from the first phase of the AIDS pandemic and is therefore far from experiencing the full effects of the crisis, which even in the absence of resistance to antiretroviral therapy, is expected to produce 6 200 000 patients with HIV and 800 000 with full\u2010blown AIDS by 2010. In these circumstances, over a quarter of the economically active population will have the disease, causing severe skill shortages, creating poverty, destroying economic development, undermining participation in political life, and giving rise to more than two million orphans who will be impoverished, uneducated, and easily drawn into crime and prostitution. The effects will also be deeply felt in the military, the police, and the legal system, which will be severely deprived of manpower and unable to function just as social tensions deepened. \u2018The net effect,\u2019 it concluded, \u2018will be entirely negative for South Africa's civil stability, possibly reducing the country to widespread social anarchy within the next five to twenty years.\u2019 This disturbing outcome, moreover, could be hastened by the public health policies of President Thabo Mbeki, who espoused the theories of the AIDS denier Peter Duesberg and rejected the link between the HIV virus and the disease.",

Funding levels in the fight against the disease increased from $300 million in 1996 to nearly $9 billion a decade later (69). A further step was that like the United States, the United Nations announced that it regarded infectious diseases as threats to international security.

After first appearing in the Chinese province of Guangdong in November 2002, it erupted as an international health threat in March 2003, when the WHO received notification and declared a global travel alert. Between March and the declaration on July 5 that the disease had been contained, SARS affected 8098 people, caused 774 deaths, brought international travel to a halt in entire regions, and cost $60 billion in gross expenditure and business losses to Asian countries alone. As retrospective studies have demonstrated, SARS presented many of the features that most severely expose the vulnerabilities of the global system: SARS is a respiratory disease capable of spreading from person to person without a vector; it has an asymptomatic incubation period of more than a week; it generates symptoms that closely resemble those of other diseases; it takes a heavy toll on caregivers and hospital staff; it readily spreads unobserved aboard aircraft; and it has a case fatality rate of 10%. At the time this new disease appeared, moreover, its causative pathogen (SARS\u2010associated coronavirus) was unknown, and there was neither a diagnostic test nor a specific treatment. For all of these reasons, it dramatically confirmed the IOM's 1992 prediction that all countries were more vulnerable than ever to EIDs. SARS demonstrated no predilection for any region of the globe and was no respecter of prosperity, education, technology, or access to health care. Indeed, after its outbreak in China, SARS spread by airplane primarily to affluent cities such as Singapore, Hong Kong, and Toronto, where it struck relatively prosperous travelers and their contacts, hospital workers, patients, and hospital visitors, rather than targeting the poor and the marginalized. More than half of the recognized cases occurred in well\u2010equipped and technologically advanced hospital settings such as the Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong, the Scarborough Hospital in Toronto, and the Tan Tock Seng Hospital in Singapore (31, 76, 77).",

At the same time the newly created GOARN, together with such national partners as the Canadian Public Health Intelligence Network, the CDC, and the WHO Global Influenza Network, took rapid action to issue global alerts, monitor the progress of the disease, and supervise containment strategies before the disease could establish itself endemically. Ironically, given the high\u2010tech quality of the diagnostic and monitoring effort, the containment policies were based on traditional methods dating from the public health strategies against bubonic plague by the 17th century and the foundation of epidemiology as a discipline in the 19th. These measures were case tracking, isolation, quarantine, the cancellation of mass gatherings, the surveillance of travelers, recommendations to increase personal hygiene, and barrier protection by means of masks, gowns, gloves, and eye protection (78). Although SARS affected 27 countries and every continent, the containment operation coordinated by GOARN successfully limited the outbreak overwhelmingly to hospital settings with only sporadic community involvement, so that by July 5 the WHO could announce that the pandemic was over.",

Indeed, resource\u2010poor countries that were compliant with the new framework of obligations nonetheless found it difficult or impossible to maintain the surveillance effort for the full 4\u2010month duration of the emergency. Still more tellingly, it was also clear that a major factor in the containment of SARS was simple good fortune. The world was lucky that SARS is spread by droplets and therefore requires extended contact for transmission, unlike classic airborne diseases such as influenza and smallpox. It was, relatively, much easier to contain, because except in the infrequent and still poorly understood case of so\u2010called \u2018super shedders,\u2019 it is not readily communicable from person to person.

The result has been an explosion of knowledge, grants, and publications with priority given to genomic approaches to microbes and vectors, to the development of vaccines, and to the search for new medications and diagnostic tools. Naturally there are grounds for criticism of various aspects of these initiatives. There is, for example, general agreement that overall levels of funding remain inadequate to the extent of the crisis and that after initial enthusiasm, governments have not continued to increase their support. There are also reasonable grounds for disagreement as to the relative distribution of research efforts, with discussion, for example, about the balance struck between research against HIV/AIDS and that against such other major diseases as malaria, TB, and pandemic influenza. Some have also questioned whether developing vaccines is the right paradigm on all fronts. For example, should priority be given to those diseases for which the human immune response gives grounds for optimism that \u2013 on the basis of historical experience \u2013 a safe and effective vaccine can be developed (e.g. influenza and dengue)? Or should other strategies be followed with respect to diseases for which the human immune response makes the development of a vaccine a far more arduous and unpredictable endeavor (e.g. cholera and malaria)? Nevertheless, although there is no basis for false confidence, global research efforts have been galvanized, and major advances have been made in the field of infectious diseases in comparison with the early decades after World War II.

Clearly unrestrained demographic growth as the world population approaches seven billion strains all resources, degrades the environment, gives rise to the megacities and peri\u2010urban slums where dengue, TB, and cholera thrive, drives populations to intrude into forests where they are exposed to new zoonotic infections, and overwhelms educational, housing, and hygienic infrastructures. Here, the medical and public health communities agree, is a driving factor in the new human vulnerability to emerging diseases. The remedies, moreover, are already known, involving voluntary universal access for women to family planning education and technologies. One of the few forums even to raise the issue was the \u2018First International Conference on Women and Infectious Diseases\u2019 held in Atlanta, February 27\u201328, 2004, where it was noted that, \u2018Women's health, in and of itself, rarely has been at the forefront of international development programs or national health planning and policies\u2019 (81). In the field of infectious diseases, this lacuna is especially glaring because women are, as the conference stressed, more susceptible to infections than men, both for biological reasons and due to their caregiving roles and their relative burden of unemployment and poverty. Women, moreover, suffer more serious complications from infectious diseases, above all during pregnancy.",

Nearly all of the leading studies on emerging diseases regard poverty and its sequelae of poor diet, substandard housing, lack of education, and inadequate access to health care as one of the chief determinants of epidemic disease. Poverty prevents people from taking measures to protect their own health, it undermines the immune system, it complicates access to safe water supplies, it leads to overcrowding in unhygienic housing, and it creates patterns of labor mobility and migration that compromise health. Health care workers and clinicians recognize the link between inadequate resources and disease, with the result that many of the leading epidemic infections are widely termed \u2018diseases of poverty\u2019 (82). The issue therefore surfaces in WHO campaigns to combat the three most important contemporary epidemics: HIV/AIDS, malaria, and TB. As the 2005 report Addressing Poverty in TB Control stated:",

Here the position of the leading figures in the campaign to recognize the importance of emerging and reemerging diseases is strangely contradictory. The IOM examined the managed care revolution in the United States and the implications of for\u2010profit medicine for the preparedness of the nation to face infectious diseases (85). By 2000, managed care already enrolled 150 million Americans and therefore dominated health care delivery. The performance of the managed care revolution, however, did not inspire the IOM. On the contrary, it produced a list of the major problems that, in its view, managed care created for public health. This list was lengthy and devastating. According to the IOM, managed care creates severe public health difficulties because it does the following: (i) it places such strict controls on reimbursements that it becomes an impediment to effective collaboration with the public health community; (ii) it lowers costs by fostering management of infectious diseases by non\u2010specialists; (iii) it promotes the shift from inpatient to outpatient treatment, where there are neither the specialists nor the infrastructure to diagnose or contain infectious diseases; (iv) it proliferates bureaucratic complexities that complicate prompt response to disease outbreaks; (v) it reduces the commitment to training and research; and (vi) it encourages excessive antibiotic use (85).",

To the extent that uninsured people avoid care entirely or seek it only at a late stage of their illness, the prompt information on which effective public health depends is undermined. In addition, excluding people from coverage drives them further into poverty and creates an underclass of the marginalized. Finally, managed care relentlessly cuts costs by squeezing out of the system the surge capacity on which populations depend in the event of a disease outbreak. Nevertheless, despite these observations, the IOM reached perfectly anodyne conclusions. It did not conclude that only a system that guaranteed universal access is compatible with defense against infectious disease threats. Instead, it lamely urged a deeper partnership between the managed care industry and public health officials.",
