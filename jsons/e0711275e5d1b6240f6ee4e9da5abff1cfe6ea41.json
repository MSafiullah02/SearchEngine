Dr. Meyer emigrated from Germany in the late 1800's after serving as an army surgeon during the aftermath of the Franco-Prussian War [1] . In 1917, Dr. Meyer founded the AATS in the midst of the \"Great War\", a conflict that was destined to become a war of totality. Never had a war covered so large a part of the earth. A century later, you would hardly consider those times to be favorable for the founding and growth of an organization that was not directly involved in the war effort. Despite the many obstacles, Dr. Meyer's group felt strongly that trauma and infectious diseases of the chest would play a major role during the war and that they should not let the progress they had made to this point fade away [2] . Remarkably similar to current day conditions facing the 100th Annual Meeting, the Inaugural AATS Meeting in 1918 took place June 10 in Chicago during the first wave of the World's most deadly pandemic -H1N1 influenza A, which took the life of an estimated 50 million worldwide. In contrast to today, however, the world was slow to identify the importance of isolation, quarantine, good personal hygiene, and limitations to public gatherings ( Figure 1 ).",

It was becoming increasingly clear that our international colleagues were not going to be able to attend the Annual Meeting due to worldwide travel restrictions.",

The first AATS member who practiced outside North America was Georges Dehelly of LeHavre, France who was elected to membership at the 1st Annual Meeting in 1918. In addition, the first paper published in the Journal of Thoracic Surgery in 1931 (which went on to become the Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery [4] ) was from Peiping Union Medical College in China [5] . The AATS, for history's sake, will continue with its century long name, but its spirit has become increasingly international, focused on bidirectional knowledge sharing across the globe. We realize there are many surgeons around the world who do not have the resources to attend the AATS Annual Meeting each spring in person. As such, we have made it part of our mission moving forward to increase our global outreach for education and to promote excellence in clinical care.",
