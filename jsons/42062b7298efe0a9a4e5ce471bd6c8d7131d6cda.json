            "text": "The development of efficient vaccines against viral pathogens is considered one of the biggest achievements of modern medicine, and significantly contributed to the increase in life expectancy worldwide. However, no vaccines exist for many life-threatening viruses such as HIV (Burton, 2019) , Zika virus (Pierson and Diamond, 2018) , or HCV (Bailey et al., 2019) . Additionally, efficient broad-spectrum antiviral drugs are still missing, making infectious diseases a significant challenge for modern health systems. Viruses can also trigger or fuel non-infectious diseases such as cancer (Young and Rickinson, 2004) and are suspected to contribute to various other chronic diseases such as Alzheimer disease (Itzhaki, 2018) , and various auto-immune disorders (M\u00fcnz et al., 2009 ). The recent emergence of highly-pathogenic viruses such as the Ebola virus and the emerging SARS-CoV-2 pandemic recalls the constant threat that viruses represent to global health. So far, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused a global financial and social catastrophe, and is expected to make a significant long-lasting impact on human health (Zhu et al., 2020) . Despite intensive research efforts, little is known thus far regarding the interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with the human host and, as a consequence, no efficient treatment has been designed so far (CHEN Jun, 2020) . Moreover, only few therapeutic targets have been identified, highlighting the urgency to develop additional strategies to dissect the virus-host interactions.",

            "text": "Single cell-RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is an emerging technology that has been extensively used to study several complex diseases, including cancer , neurodegeneration (Keren-Shaul et al., 2017) , auto-immune (Zhang et al., 2019) and metabolic diseases , providing new insights, and revealing new therapeutic targets and strategies (Yofe et al., 2020) . In the context of infectious diseases, scRNA-seq studies have started to identify the underlying cells and pathways interacting with various pathogens (Drayman et al., 2019; Shnayder et al., 2018; Steuerman et al., 2018; Zanini et al., 2018) . During the immune response to a pathogen, a very limited number of antigen-positive or infected cells initiate and modulate the host immune response (Blecher-Gonen et al., 2019) , while most of the tissue response is propagated through cytokines, such as type I IFN signaling, to bystander, uninfected cells. It is therefore essential to develop new analytical tools to identify the rare infected cells in order to better understand complex hostvirus interactions underlying these pathologies. Multiple experimental tools have been developed over the years to track virus-infected cells in vivo, characterize the cellular state of the infected cells, and differentiate them from their bystander neighbors. These include fluorescently labeled pathogens or pathogens expressing fluorescent proteins (De Baets et al., 2015; Blecher-Gonen et al., 3 2019), as well as reporter mice (Lienenklaus et al., 2009) . However, in the case of human clinical samples, these tools are limited, making the pathogen-infected cells and viral reservoir cell types hard to detect.",

As scRNA-seq technologies rely on polyadenylated RNA isolation and amplification, current scRNA-seq methods can, in theory, detect these viral RNA programs and therefore enable accurate identification of the bona fide infected cells and their unique properties at single-cell resolution. While such an approach has already been used to study both in vitro (Drayman et al., 2019; Shnayder et al., 2018) and in vivo infection models (Steuerman et al., 2018) , no general computational framework has been developed to detect viruses and analyze host-viral maps in clinical samples. Here we present a new computational tool, called Viral-Track, that is designed to systematically scan for viral RNA in scRNA-seq data of physiological viral infections using a direct mapping strategy. Viral-Track performs comprehensive mapping of scRNAseq data onto a large database of known viral genomes, providing precise annotation of the cell types associated with viral infections. Integrating these data with the host transcriptome enables transcriptional sorting and differential profiling of the viral-infected compared to bystander cells.",

Viral-Track is able to annotate the viral program with high accuracy and sensitivity, as we demonstrate in several in vivo mouse models of infection, as well as human samples of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Applying Viral-Track on Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL) samples from moderate and severe COVID-19 patients, we reveal the infection landscape of SARS-CoV-2 and its interaction with the host tissue. Our analysis shows a dramatic impact of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on the immune system of severe patients, including replacement of the tissue resident alveolar macrophages with recruited inflammatory monocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages and an altered CD8 + T cell cytotoxic response, compared to mild cases. We find that the SARS-CoV-2 mainly infects the epithelial and macrophage subsets. In addition, Viral-Track detects an unexpected co-infection of the human Meta-pneumovirus in one of the severe patients. This study establishes ViralTrack as a broadly applicable tool for dissecting mechanisms of viral infections, including identification of the cellular and molecular signatures involved in virus-induced pathologies.",

            "text": "All single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) computational packages implement a pipeline that initially aligns the sequenced reads to the expressed part of a reference host genome of the relevant organism profiled. Irrelevant reads, representing other organisms, primers, adaptors, template switching oligonucleotides, and other contaminants are then commonly discarded. We reasoned that during infection, and likely many other pathological processes, these reads can potentially carry valuable information about viral RNA that is discarded in this filtering step. In order to efficiently detect viral reads from raw scRNA-seq data in an unsupervised manner, we developed Viral-Track, an R-based computational pipeline ( Figure 1A ; STAR Methods). Briefly, Viral-Track relies on the STAR aligner (Dobin et al., 2013) to map the reads of scRNA-seq data to both the host reference genome and an extensive list of high-quality viral genomes (Stano et al., 2016) . Since viral reads are highly repetitive and generate substantial sequencing artifacts, the viral genomes identified in Viral-Track with a sufficient number of mapped reads are then filtered, based on read mapping quality, nucleotide composition, sequence complexity, and genome coverage, to limit the occurrence of false positives (STAR Methods). Due to the lack of high-quality viral genome annotations, Viral-Track includes a de novo transcriptome assembly on the identified viruses using StringTie (Pertea et al., 2015) . Finally, viral reads are demultiplexed, quantified using Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMI) and assigned to unique viral transcripts and cells (Figure 1A and S1A).",

We first evaluated mouse lungs infected in vivo by Influenza A virus and sequenced using MARS-seq2.0 (Keren-Shaul et al., 2019; Steuerman et al., 2018) . Viral-Track analysis specifically detected the 8 distinct Influenza A viral segments (NC_002016 to NC_002023 Refseq nucleotide sequences) from the specific infecting strain (H1N1 Puerto Rico 8 strain) ( Figure   1B ). We performed transcriptome assembly to test the feasibility of reconstructing the viral transcriptome from 3'-enriched scRNA-seq data. The results were highly coherent with the current knowledge of Influenza A transcriptome, exemplified by Viral-Track's ability to identify docu-5 mented spliced transcript structures with single-nucleotide precision. For instance, we identified the exact location of the key splicing site on segment 7 that gives rise to M2 transcript and links nucleotides 51 and 740 (Dubois et al., 2014) (Figure 1C) . Quantification of the number of viral reads across different experimental conditions was consistent with current knowledge of the disease, with lung stomal cells of non-immune lineages (CD45 -) exhibiting a significantly higher viral load compared to immune cells (CD45 + ) (p = 0.039, two-tailed Welch's t-test) ( Figure 1D ).",

All samples were sequenced concurrently to test for cross-sample viral read contamination. For both viruses, Viral-Track was able to identify the correct viral segments (Figure S1C-D), with no cross-contamination, evident by the absence of VSV reads detected in the LCMV-infected cells and vice versa ( Figure   S1E ). We further generalized Viral-Track for commonly used scRNA-seq technologies and non-6 RNA viruses. We applied Viral-Track to scRNA-seq data from a recently publication of human primary cells infected ex vivo with Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1), a linear double stranded DNA virus, generated by the Drop-seq platform (Drayman et al., 2019; Macosko et al., 2015) .

Coverage analysis revealed a strong peak located at the 5' end of the C gene, encoding for the main core protein, suggesting that the HBV virus is actively producing virions ( Figure 1G ). We then overlaid the viral data on the host transcriptome to identify infected and bystander populations. A total of 13,803 cells passed a lenient quality control, permitting apoptotic signals that may arise from viral infection. We identified several non-immune cell types (Figure S1J Together, this extensive list of validations demonstrate that Viral-Track is a sensitive and accurate method to detect and identify in an unsupervised manner virus strains in diverse scRNA-seq samples, in different tissues, and at varying viral types and loads.

Following clustering and annotation, we observed similar proportions of GFP + and vUMI + cells across cell clusters (Figure 2A and S2C ; R=0.95, p = 9.0 * 10 -12 ), with monocytes, marginal zone B cells (MZBs) and macrophages being the major infected cell types. We then evaluated the transcriptional signatures within these two sets of cells by computing the Pearson correlation between each pair of cells. We observed similar distribution of Pearson correlation within the GFP + and vUMI + monocyte cells ( Figure 2B ) that was significantly higher (median correlation of 0.65, 0.64 and 0.51, respectively) than the correlation observed between GFP -vUMIbystander monocytes.

Indeed, LCMV-infected MZB cells exhibited higher levels of cell cycle related genes such as Smc2 (required for chromatin condensation), Cdc6 (regulator of DNA replication) and Stm1 (regulator of mitotic spindle) ( Figure 2E, S2D) , but also of Fibrillarin (Fbl), a host factor whose expression is required by several viruses (Deffrasnes et al., 2016 ) ( Figure   2E ) .

Additionally, NK cells and na\u00efve CCR7 + CD4 + T cells were consistently enriched across severe patients BAL, while activated ZNF683 hi CD8 + cytotoxic T cells were specific to mild patients ( Figure 3E, S3F) . We also observed changes in the epithelial compartment, as severe patients exhibited higher numbers of club cells and AT2 cells (Figure 3F and S3G). Investigating expression patterns of shared gene expression programs, we observed that NK cells and the CD4 + Tfh cells are the most proliferative compartments (Figure 3G ), while a broad Interferon type I response, a hallmark of viral response, is mainly expressed by neutrophils and, to a lesser extent, FCN1 + monocytes ( Figure 3H ). We next performed in-depth differential gene expression analysis between subsets characteristic of mild or severe patients. We found that CD4 + T cells in the severe patients exhibit a more na\u00efve phenotype, expressing higher levels of IL7R, CCR7, S1PR1 and LTB. The activated CD8 + T cells signatures are restricted to the mild patients, and have higher levels of the effector molecules XCL1, ITGAE, CXCR6 and ZNF683 ( Figure 3J ).

In contrast, no viral read was detected in the three mild patients ( Figure 4A ). Coverage analysis revealed that the majority of the viral reads mapped to the 3' end of the viral segment and corresponded to positive stranded RNA ( Figure 4B ). This is in agreement with the coronavirus transcription: due to a nested transcription process all genomic and subgenomic RNA molecules share the same 3' end (Masters, 2006) . We then analyzed the enrichment of vUMIs in the cell populations represented in the BAL samples. We observed a strong enrichment of viral reads in the ciliated and epithelial progenitor population, two known cellular targets of the virus, which express the main receptor of the SARS-CoV-2 virus ACE2, as well as TMPRSS2, a protease essential for SARS-CoV-2 entry ( Figure 4C , S4B, Table   S2 ) (Hoffmann et al., 2020) . We also observed enrichment of SARS-CoV-2 reads in the SPP1 + macrophage population, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 can infect immune cells from the myeloid compartment or that SPP1 + macrophages phagocytose viral infected cells or particles. Differential gene expression analysis between vUMI + infected and vUMIbystander SPP1 + macrophages in the patients with the highest viral load, revealed that infected macrophages have higher expression of chemokines (CCL7, CCL8, CCL18) and APOE, and lower expression of TAOK1, a serine/threonine-protein kinase in the p38 MAPK cascade ( Figure S4C ). Interestingly, CD147 (also known as BSG) a potential new receptor (Wang et al., 2020b) is expressed by all cell types, including immune cells, suggesting alternative routes for the virus to infect these cells.",

Alternatively, it is possible to combine DNA probes with scRNA-seq to enrich for viral sequences and increase the sensitivity of the assay, but this requires prior knowledge of the viruses present in each sample (Zanini et al., 2018) . Here we present Viral-Track, a robust and unsupervised computational pipe-line that can detect viral RNA in any scRNA-seq dataset without the need for experimental modifications or prior knowledge of the infecting agent. Viral-Track was benchmarked on data originating from various tissues, infected by viruses with marked differences in their RNA properties, and generated with different scRNA-seq platforms.

Immediately after sorting, each plate was spun down to ensure cell immersion into the lysis solution, snap frozen on dry ice, and stored at -80C until processing Single-cell RNA-seq libraries were prepared as previously described (Jaitin et al., 2014) . In brief, mRNA from single cells sorted into capture plates were barcoded and converted into cDNA and then pooled using an automated pipeline. The pooled sample was linearly amplified by T7 in vitro transcription, and the resulting RNA was fragmented and converted into a sequencing-ready library by tagging the samples with pool barcodes and Illumina sequences during ligation, RT, and PCR. Each pool of cells was tested for library quality and concentration as described previously (Jaitin et al., 2014) .",

We also observed several subsets of immune cells such as B cells (MS4A1), plasma cells (MZB1), conventional dendritic cells 1 (cDC1; XCR1), plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) (TCF4) and three different Macrophage subsets (expressing TREM2, CD163 and FCN1, respectively). We observed a large diversity among the lymphocyte compartment with CD8 + T cells (CD8A), Th17 cells (CCR6, IL23A), T cells (TRGC1), activated CD4 T cells (LEF1, OX40), NK cells (NKG7) and a distinct cluster of activated CD8 + T cells (CSF2, TOX2). We analyzed infected cells using automated thresholding over the viral signal (Figure S1J, STAR Methods). As expected, hepatocytes and apoptotic hepatocytes were strongly enriched among the infected cells(Figure 1H, S1K). Interestingly, we also detected viral reads in non-hepatocyte clusters, including two subsets of macrophages (CD163 + and TREM2 + populations respectively), the cDC1 subset (XCR1 + ), as well as endothelial (OIT3 + cells) and epithelial cells (KRT7 + )(Figure 1H, S1K). Infection of non-hepatocyte clusters, although with relatively low viral load, is coherent with several studies, reporting active infection of macrophages(Faure-Dupuy et al., 2019).",

            "text": "Viral-Track is a new and powerful tool to decipher host-viral interactions. However, its impact is dependent on several factors, the most critical one being the biochemical and pathophysiological properties of the virus. The absence of a poly(A)  tail at the end of viral RNA molecules can significantly decrease their capture rate efficiency in current scRNA-seq techniques, as shown by the LCMV example. This may hinder Viral-Track's ability to robustly identify infected cells, or discern differential expression between infected and bystander cells in such viruses. Other properties of the viral RNA molecules; absence/presence of 5' capping, nucleotide composition, or dependence on RNA binding proteins may also affect capture efficiency, and as the technology develops, further research will focus on the classification of molecular features that facilitate or prevent virus identification by scRNA-seq. Notably, non poly(A) based scRNA-seq techniques, such as RamDA-seq(Hayashi et al., 2018) can be potentially used when profiling these datasets.Another limiting factor for Viral-Track's applicability is the potential scarcity of viral reads and infected cells in the sample. As shown in our analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infected samples, only a limited number of viral reads are detected in some of the samples. This may be due to the to specific stage of the disease, or sampling biases favoring mainly the lung immune populations, with lower representation of non-immune cells, which are the primary targets of the virus. Therefore, future COVID-19 scRNA-seq studies should consider this limitation in their experimental design, and aim for a better representation of the upper respiratory tissue and the lung parenchyma. Alternative approaches may rely on index sorting and single-cell transcriptome-trained sorting to design optimal gating strategies for capturing and enriching the stromal populations.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank Dr. Noam Stern Ginossar and Dr. Yoav Golan for careful evaluation of the manuscript, Dr. Etienne Simon-Loriere, Thomas Jacquemont and Alice Balfourier for valuable advices, Tali Wiesel from the Scientific Illustration unit of the Weizmann Institute for artwork, members of the Amit laboratory for discussions.
