            "text": "IL-29 was discovered in 2003. It is a new member of a subfamily of Type II cytokines. The discovery of IL-29, along with IL-28A and IL-28B comprise the Type III interferons, also labeled as IFN\u03bb1\u2013IFN\u03bb3, respectively (Donnelly and Kotenko, 2010, Witte et al., 2009, Kotenko et al., 2003). While these three cytokines are usually described in unison under the IFN\u03bb title, there are differences that distinguish IL-29 from IL28A and IL28B. Both IL-28A and IL28B are nearly structurally identical to each other, while IL-29 is more structurally unique (Fujie and Numasaki, 2012). IL-29 is the most potent IFN\u03bb molecule in humans, as well as the most abundant IFN\u03bb molecule in serum, despite only existing as a pseudogene in mice (Donnelly and Kotenko, 2010, Alborzi et al., 2015, Hamming et al., 2010, Lasfar et al., 2006, Maher et al., 2008). Interestingly, IL-29 is also the only human IFN\u03bb molecule to display N-linked glycosylation (Donnelly and Kotenko, 2010).",

            "text": "Previously discovered and well understood interferons consist of the Type I interferons, which include thirteen IFN\u03b1 subtypes, IFN\u03b2, \u03c9, \u03b5, and \u03ba in humans, and Type II interferons whose sole member is IFN\u03b3. Elucidated roles of interferons include antiviral, anti-proliferative, and immunomodulatory activities, with the induced effect varying depending on the cell type they are acting upon (de Weerd et al., 2007, Platanias, 2005). IFN\u03bbs have been shown to exhibit antiviral and anti-proliferative activities produced through the same signaling pathways as those utilized by IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2 (Donnelly and Kotenko, 2010, Kotenko et al., 2003), although these effects are seen to a more limited extent as compared to the vast array of cell types influenced by Type I Interferons (Donnelly and Kotenko, 2010, Witte et al., 2009, Brand et al., 2005). The cellular targets for IFN\u03bb appear to be primarily of epithelial origin, whereas its effects are absent on a broad range of other cells typically affected by Type I interferons, such as leukocytes (Donnelly and Kotenko, 2010, Witte et al., 2009, Kotenko et al., 2003, Meager et al., 2005). Also, despite signaling through pathways used by Type I interferons (Doyle et al., 2006, Dumoutier et al., 2004, Jordan et al., 2007, O'Shea et al., 2002), and recent cDNA microarray analyses indicating that the gene patterns expressed by both Type I and III are essentially the same (Jordan et al., 2007), the two interferon types act through different heterodimeric cell receptors. The Type I receptors (IFNAR) include IFNAR1 and IFNAR2, Type II receptors (IFNGR) include IFNGR1 and IFNGR2, while Type III receptors include IFNLR1 and IL10R\u03b2 (de Weerd et al., 2007, Donnelly et al., 2004, Yoon et al., 2010). In fact, the discovery of the IFNLR receptor, and its ligand\u2019s apparent relativeness to the IFN\u03b1 molecule instigated the discovery of the IFN\u03bbs (Pekarek et al., 2007). IL10R\u03b2 is a receptor that is also utilized by other cytokines, including IL-10, IL-22, and IL-26. Its signaling induces pleiotropic effects including protection from hyperactive immune responses and immune response activation in epithelial cells (Yoon et al., 2010, Wolk et al., 2008, Xu et al., 2016).",

IL-29, due to it being the most potent Type III interferon, is the cytokine of interest in this review. Studies have indicated its ability to serve as a mediator between the innate and adaptive immune responses. Furthermore, its specificity for targeting a limited scope of cell types could allow it to be used in therapeutic treatments while decreasing side toxicities that accompany Type I interferon therapies (Egli et al., 2014). Multiple studies also indicate IL-29\u2032s involvement in the pathogenesis of cancer, as well as its antitumor effects (Meager et al., 2014). In this review, we will discuss the recent advancements in IL-29 immunology and cancer research.",

Immune cells have shown less sensitivity to IL-29, despite expressing the appropriate IFN\u03bb receptor. Witte et al. accredit this to the presence of a splice variant of the IFNLR receptor secreted by immune cells.

The STAT1/STAT2 signaling cascade transpires as follows: once tyrosine residues on STAT1 and STAT2 are phosphorylated, these proteins dimerize and are subsequently transported to the nucleus. Once transported, the dimer combines with interferon regulatory factor 9 to form the interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) complex (Darnell et al., 1994). In the nucleus the ISGF3 complex binds to interferon-stimulated response elements (ISFE) that further induce interferon-stimulated gene transcription (Maher et al., 2008). The STAT1/STAT2 signaling pathways are the primary signaling pathways for the Type I interferon antiviral response that occurs in the immediate days following viral infection (Steen and Gamero, 2013). The induction of ISFEs by ISGF3 induces the transcription of hundreds of genes involved in the antiviral response. Notable antiviral gene examples include Mx1, OAS, and IFIT (Diamond and Farzan, 2013, Platanias and Fish, 1999).",

Microorganisms produce ligands that bind to TLRs on antigen-presenting cells, inducing them to secrete IL-12 which mediates the immune response by polarizing T cells into Th1 cells (Liu et al., 2011, Hayes et al., 1998, Trinchieri and Gerosa, 1996). Th1 cells play a critical role in clearance of infections by secreting IFN\u03b3, IL-2, and TNF\u03b2, which activates macrophages to produce cell-mediated and phagocytic immune responses (Romagnani, 1999). Studies by Liu et al. also showed that IL-29 further increases the responsiveness of macrophages to IFN\u03b3, thus enhancing the immune response. Again, this is in contrast to IFN\u03b1, which suppressed the responsiveness of macrophages to IFN\u03b3 stimulation (Liu et al., 2011, Byrnes et al., 2001, McRae et al., 1998).",

IL-13 has shown to play a critical role in airway inflammation during bronchial asthma (Koch and Finotto, 2015, Srinivas et al., 2008, Wills-Karp, 2004). IL-19, another cytokine involved in asthma inflammation is also inhibited by IL-29.

Multiple experiments have indicated the significant presence of IL-29 during HCV infection, where it is apparent that IL-29 provides antiviral defense independent of Type I interferons (Diegelmann et al., 2010, Lee et al., 2014, Park et al., 2012). Kanda et al. (2012) demonstrated that IL-29 inhibits internal ribosomal entry site mediated translation by both HCV and HAV. Other studies also show that HBV, which often causes chronic liver inflammation, also induces increased IL-29 expression. He et al. showed that IL-29 promotes the spontaneous seroconversion of the Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeA). The marked increase in anti-HBeA thus provides subsequent HBV clearance (Liaw, 2009, Yu et al., 2011).",
