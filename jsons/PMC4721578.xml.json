            "text": "The first report of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) described a patient who died from a severe respiratory illness in a hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in June, 2012. A previously unrecognised coronavirus (MERS-CoV) isolated from this patient1 was similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which caused an epidemic in 2002\u201303. The virus was initially designated human coronavirus-EMC, but was renamed MERS-CoV with global consensus.2 The genomic structure of MERS-CoV was delineated3 and dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4, also known as CD26) was identified as the host-cell receptor for cell entry.4 Reverse genetics enabled the virus's genome to be studied,5, 6 and molecular diagnostic tests were quickly developed. The high mortality rates in family-based and hospital-based outbreaks, especially in patients with comorbidities such as diabetes and renal failure,7, 8, 9, 10 along with the respiratory droplet route of transmission, evoked global concern and intensive discussion in the media. The numbers of reported MERS cases spiked during hospital-based cluster outbreaks in the spring of 2013 and 2014; some cases are still detected throughout the year. MERS-CoV was deemed a serious public health epidemic threat, because millions of pilgrims from 184 countries converge in Saudi Arabia each year for the Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages. Fortunately, no MERS cases were associated with the 2013 and 2014 Hajj pilgrimages.",

Retrospective studies identified an outbreak involving 13 patients in April, 2012, in Zarqa, Jordan.13 Since then, cases have been identified across the Arabian peninsula, in Asia, Europe, Africa, and the USA (figure 1\n). Patients reported outside the Middle East all had a history of recent travel to the Arabian peninsula or had close contact with a primary case. Saudi Arabia has reported the most cases (1016 cases and 447 deaths [44% mortality], as of May 30, 2015). Several proactive global surveillance and information systems are related to MERS and guidelines for prevention, treatment, and infection control are updated regularly by WHO, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Saudi Ministry of Health, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, and Public Health England (appendix). Surveillance has intensified over time, especially in health-care and community outbreaks, as it has become clear that infected patients can be asymptomatic or have acute febrile illnesses or upper respiratory tract disease.12\n",

            "text": "Coronaviruses are large (28\u201332 kb) single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses (figure 2\n).18 To enter host cells, MERS-CoV attaches to its receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4. Protease cleavage of the S protein is then required for virus\u2013cell fusion and release of genomic RNA into the cytoplasm. Viral RNA transcription and replication occurs on double membrane vesicles and other membranous structures, which are derived from the endoplasmic reticulum. Transcription of the seven subgenomic mRNAs occurs via negative-strand subgenomic RNA intermediates. Subgenomic RNAs are 3\u2032 co-terminally nested and are joined to a common leader encoded at the 5\u2032 end of the genome. Viral RNA is encapsidated in the N protein and transported to the endoplasmic reticulum\u2013Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), the site of assembly. Viral RNA encapsidated in the N protein then buds into vesicles lined with the S, M, and E proteins. Vesicles are then transported to the cell surface before release. Four coronavirus genera have been identified, with human viruses detected in the alphacoronavirus (NL63 and HCoV-229E) and betacoronavirus (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV) genera. MERS-CoV is a lineage c betacoronavirus and SARS-CoV is a lineage b betacoronavirus. The genomic structures of the two viruses are very similar, with proteins involved in virus replication encoded at the 5\u2032 end and structural proteins encoded by genes at the 3\u2032 end of the genome (figure 2).3 Accessory proteins, which are not required for virus viability, are interspersed throughout the structural genes and might interfere with the innate immune response in infected animals. MERS-CoV has five different accessory proteins and SARS-CoV has eight different accessory proteins, which share no sequence similarity. These differences, which presumably have different effects on induction and signalling of type 1 interferon, could explain why MERS-CoV is more sensitive to interferon than is SARS-CoV.19, 20 This difference in interferon sensitivity has implications for treatment because type 1 interferon has been used to treat patients infected with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.21, 22\n",

SARS-CoV probably originated in bats25, 26, 27 and adapted to non-bat variants of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 as it crossed species to infect human beings.28, 29 Changes in the surface glycoprotein enhanced binding to the human receptor. MERS-CoV has not mutated much during transmission in human populations; only a single mutation at position 1020 of the surface protein has been consistently detected in human isolates.30 This aminoacid is located in a region of the protein involved in fusion to host-cell membranes but not in binding to DPP4. By contrast with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV can bind to DPP4 from several species.4, 31 Thus, non-human primates, rabbits, goats, sheep, and horses, among other animals, are thought to be susceptible to infection in addition to camels and human beings. This difference in the role of surface glycoprotein mutation in virus adaptation to new populations is probably a result of subtle differences in the mechanism of virus entry: coronavirus entry involves both binding to the receptor and subsequent release of a fusion peptide. The relative importance of each component is different in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections.32 Understanding of the relative roles of receptor binding and protease action will enable prediction of whether specific zoonotic coronaviruses will infect human beings and the likelihood of adaptation.",

Renal dysfunction or failure is common in patients8, 13, 33 and could be a consequence of either hypoxic damage or direct infection of the kidney. The latter is a possibility because DPP4 is expressed at high levels in the kidney.34 Analysis of patient tissue samples is needed for a greater understanding of sites of infection. Unfortunately, no tissue samples are available, largely for cultural and religious reasons, so that much of our understanding of pathogenesis comes from studies of experimentally infected animals. Several animals can be experimentally infected with MERS-CoV, including macaques, marmosets, and camels. Macaques develop mild clinical disease with evidence of inflammatory cell infiltration on radiological examination,35, 36 making them a useful model for non-lethal MERS. By contrast, infected marmosets develop severe interstitial pneumonia.37 Neutrophil and macrophage infiltration and alveolar oedema have been reported in infected lung tissue. Infected marmosets are useful models for severe MERS, but these animals are not readily available, limiting their utility. In another study, three camels that were experimentally infected with MERS-CoV developed mild rhinitis but not systemic disease.38 Virus was shed for several days, suggesting that camel-to-camel and camel-to-person spread contributed to the ongoing MERS outbreak.",

Thus, whereas transduced immunocompetent mice develop only mild or no clinical disease, mice deficient in type 1 interferon signalling develop more clinical disease and more extensive pathological changes in the lungs. Like infected macaques, these mice are most useful for vaccine and antivirus studies.

Similar findings have been reported for patients with SARS:48 ineffectual B-cell and T-cell responses with prolonged cytokine expression have been detected in patients with severe disease, whereas a more rapid shutoff of the innate immune response and a potent anti-SARS-CoV antibody response was reported in recovered patients. The anti-SARS-CoV antibody response waned until it was undetectable by 6 years after infection whereas T-cell responses could still be detected.49 Thus, vaccines that result in only antibody responses will probably be useful in the short term, but might not provide long-term protection against MERS-CoV.",

Most infections resulted from person-to-person spread, emphasising the importance of appropriate contact and droplet precautions to prevent transmission to other patients, health-care workers, and family members.76 Person-to-person spread in health-care facilities was also implicated in the 2014 MERS-CoV outbreak in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Patients that were initially considered primary cases were, on further investigation, found to have been exposed to MERS-CoV-infected patients, generally in health-care facilities.77\n",

The presence of viral nucleic acid can be confirmed either by positive real-time reverse transcription PCR on at least two specific genomic targets or by a single positive target with sequencing of a second positive PCR product.97 Available real-time reverse transcription PCR tests include an assay targeting RNA upstream of the E gene (upE) and assays targeting open reading frames 1b (ORF 1b) and 1a (ORF 1a). The assay for the upE target is highly sensitive and is recommended for screening; the ORF 1a assay is of equal sensitivity. The ORF 1b assay is less sensitive but is useful for confirmation. These assays have not shown cross-reactivity with other respiratory viruses including human coronaviruses. Two target sites on the MERS-CoV genome suitable for sequencing to aid confirmation are in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp; present in ORF 1b) and N genes (figure 2).97\n",

Patients with MERS should be placed in negative pressure rooms or in rooms in which room exhaust is filtered through high-efficiency particulate air filters.

Although a zoonotic source of the virus is most likely, the route of transmission could be through either direct or indirect contact, or consumption of a contaminated food or food product. Although several studies have shown the possible links between human cases of MERS and transmission from camels, much is unknown of the origins, geographical distribution, exact mode of transmission, and relationships between MERS-CoV and MERS-CoV-like infections in bats, camels, other animals, and human beings. The sporadic nature of many cases of MERS has hindered in-depth case-control studies and investigation of rates of secondary transmission, including establishing the role of subclinical infection in human-to-human transmission. The natural history, pathogenesis, host susceptibility factors, virulence, viral kinetics, period of greatest infectiousness, underlying mechanisms of protective immunity, and factors governing treatment outcome are also unknown.84 This lack of knowledge is hindering the development of drug treatment, adjunctive treatments, specific diagnostic tests, biomarkers, and vaccines.",

More information about how long the virus has infected human beings, which could be obtained from analyses of pre-2012 human serum samples (if available), would help assessment of the likelihood of further adaptation to people. Further genomic studies will provide insights into the molecular characteristics, mutation rates, and virus transmission dynamics, defining factors crucial for species specificity and virulence, and enabling the discovery of new drug targets, novel drugs, diagnostic tests, and vaccines. Post-mortem and histological studies have not been available and even limited autopsy or surgical specimens would be useful. The availability of an animal model of severe MERS-CoV infection and disease will be important for understanding pathogenesis, natural history, and immune responses, and for developing effective treatments. These studies are urgently needed because coronaviruses have high genetic mutability and MERS-CoV continues to circulate in countries in the Arabian peninsula. Although interhuman transmission is still inefficient, health authorities, governments, and the research community should be prepared for the emergence of a MERS-CoV with increased capacity for transmission and pandemic potential.",

The virus has circulated in camel populations in Africa and the Arabian peninsula for at least 20 years. In 2012, MERS-CoV spread to human populations, with camels the most likely source. Several possible routes of spread from camels to humans exist. MERS-CoV is believed to be transmitted among human beings by droplet, contact, and perhaps airborne spread. MERS manifests in people in various ways, ranging from asymptomatic to fulminant infections. Patients with underlying disease such as diabetes or kidney or liver disease or who are immunocompromised develop more severe disease and have a higher mortality rate after infection.
