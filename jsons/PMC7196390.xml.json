His vital signs include following: oral temperature 38\u00b0C, blood pressure 105/65 mm Hg, heart rate 94, respiratory rate 21, and pulse oximetry 93% on room air. Full clinical exam did not reveal any other problems. Indeed, He had active duty in COVID-19 outbreak with flight time of 52 hours for air transferring of suspected or confirmed patients.",

Surprisingly, RT-PCR test was negative and the next choice with symptoms existence was chest radiography. Bilateral hilar adenopathy was reported, the diagnosis and treatment process has changed basically. Pathologic report of the specimen obtained from adenopathy biopsy was noncaseating sarcoidal type granulomas. Serologic tests shown serum Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) level of 58 nmol/mL/min.Bronchoalveolar lavage specimen had CD4 to CD8 ratio of 3.68. All findings provide accurate sarcoidosis diagnosis and High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan revealed Stage I pulmonary involvement. After full investigations, he had no any other systemic involvement and treated with inhaled fluticazone. Due to pulmonary involvement, clinical manifestations, use of inhaled fluticazone, need more longer and accurate follow up and protect against COVID-19, he has been temporarily suspended until the final assignment.",
