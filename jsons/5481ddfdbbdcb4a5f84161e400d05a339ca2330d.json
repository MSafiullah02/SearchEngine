However,a systematic summarization-based narrative extraction that can facilitate communicating the main underlying events is lacking. To address this issue, we propose a novel event-based narrative summary extraction framework. Our proposed framework is designed as a probabilistic topic model, with categorical time distribution, followed by extractive text summarization. Our topic model identifies topics' recurrence over time with a varying time resolution. This framework not only captures the topic distributions from the data, but also approximates the user activity fluctuations over time. Furthermore, we define significance-dispersity trade-off (SDT) as a comparison measure to identify the topic with the highest lifetime attractiveness in a timestamped corpus. We evaluate our model on a large corpus of Twitter data, including more than one million tweets in the domain of the disinformation campaigns conducted against the White Helmets of Syria. Our results indicate that the proposed framework is effective in identifying topical trends, as well as extracting narrative summaries from text corpus with timestamped data.",

Researchers have developed automatic document summarization tools and techniques, which intend to provide concise and fluent summaries over a large corpus of textual data [20] . Preserving the key information in the summary and producing summaries that are comparable to human-created narratives are the primary goals of the extractive and abstractive approaches for automatic text summarization [2] . News websites are a prime example of such techniques, where automatic text summarization algorithms are applied to generate news headlines and titles from the news content [31] . The shortage of labeled data for text analysis has encouraged researchers to develop novel unsupervised algorithms that consider co-occurrence of words in documents as well as emerging new techniques such as exploiting an additional source of information similar to Wikipedia knowledge-based topic models [37, 38] . Additionally, unsupervised learning enables training general-purpose systems that can be used for a variety of tasks and applications as strong classifiers [7] . In this regard, statistical models of co-occurrence such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [6] , discover the relevant structure and co-occurrence dependencies of words within a collection of documents to capture the distribution of topic latent variable from the data. Although an abundant timestamped textual data, particularly from social media platforms and news reports are available for analysis, the changes in the distribution of data over time have been neglected in most of the topic mining algorithms proposed in the literature [35] . For instance, time-series analysis on datasets over the events relative to 2012 US presidential election suggests that modeling topics and extracting summaries without considering the text-time relationship lead to missing the rise and fall of topics over time, the changes in terms of correlations, and the emergence of new topics [12] .",

To achieve probabilistic modeling of narratives over topical trends, we incorporate the components of narratives including named-entities and temporal-causal coherence between events into our topical model. We believe that what differentiates a narrative model 2 from topic analysis and summarization approaches is the ability to extract relevant sequences of text relative to the corresponding series of events associated with the same topic over time. Accordingly, our proposed narrative framework integrates unsupervised topic mining with extractive text summarization for narrative identification and summary extraction. We compare the identified narratives by our model with the topics identified by Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [6] and Topics over Time (TOT) [35] . This comparison includes presenting numerical results and analysis for a large corpus of more than one million tweets in the domain of disinformation campaigns conducted against the White Helmets of Syria. The collected dataset contains tweets spanning 13 months within the years 2018 and 2019. Our results provide evidence that our proposed method is effective in identifying topical trends within a timestamped data. Furthermore, we define a novel metric called significance-dispersity trade-off (SDT) in order to compare and identify topics with higher lifetime attractiveness in timestamped data. Finally, we demonstrate that our proposed model discovers time localized topics over events that approximates the distribution of user activities on social media platforms.",

The later can be achieved via using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to demonstrate relationships over the network of entities [15] . Narrative summaries can be constructed from an ordered chain of individual events with causality relationships amongst events, appeared within a specific topic [18] .

The most commonly used approach to topic modeling is Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [19] . LDA is a generative probabilistic model with a hierarchical Bayesian network structure that can be used for a variety of applications with discrete data, including text corpora. Using LDA for topic mining, a document is a bagof-words that has a mixture of latent topics [6] . Many advanced topic modeling approaches have been derived from LDA, including Hierarchical Topic Models [15, 16] that learn and organize the topics into a hierarchy to address a super-sub topic relationship. This approach is well-suited for analyzing social media and news stories that contain rich data over a series of real-world events [30] . Topic models over time with continuous-time distribution [5] and dynamic topic models [35] intend to capture the rise and falls of topics within a time range. However, continuous-time topic models, such as beta or normal time distribution, cannot model many modes in time. Furthermore, the smooth time distribution over topics does not allow recognizing distinct topical events in the timestamped dataset, where topical events reflect the event-based topic activity fluctuations over time.",

Document summarization techniques are generally categorized into abstractive and generative text summarization models. Herein, we consider extractive text summarization methods. Several algorithms for extractive text summarization have been proposed in the literature that assign a salient score to sentences [10] . To summarize a text corpus with short text, [29] presents an automatic summarization algorithm with topic clustering, cluster ranking and assigning scores to the intermediate features, and sentence extraction. Some other approaches, particularly for the Twitter data include aggregating tweets by hashtags or conversation cascades [27, 32] , and obtaining summaries for a targeted event of interest as one or a set of tweets that are representative of the topics [8] .",

The weighted sampling leads to drawing more documents from the time categories b k with a higher \u03c8 as this time slices contain more documents related to the topic z.

Identifying topics' recurrence and significance over time categories with our model allowed us to propose significance-dispersity trade-off (SDT) metric. SDT can be employed as a comparison measure to identify the topic with the highest lifetime attractiveness in a timestamped corpus. Results on real-world timestamped data suggest that the narrative framework is effective in identifying distinct and coherent topics from the data. Additionally, the results illustrate that the identified narrative distributions approximate the user activity fluctuations over time. moreover, informative, and concise narrative summaries for timestamped data are produced. Further improvement of the narrative framework can be achieved via incorporating the causality relation cross the social media conversation cascades and social media events into account.
