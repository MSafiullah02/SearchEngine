Altogether, 56% of the subjects (28) had middle meatal NTHi during the early phase; and in six of these subjects (21%, 6/28), it led to NTHi being found in the maxillary sinus during the later phase. The active role of pathogenic bacteria in the middle meatus, with wider spreading of the disease to the paranasal sinuses, supports the theory that the ostiomeatal complex is the key area in the pathogenesis of bacterial ARS. [21] [22] [23] Supporting our present findings, we have shown earlier in children that the presence of nasal middlemeatus pathogenic bacteria predicted delayed recovery. 24 Similarly, Kaiser et al. 25 found that adult patients with acute respiratory infection and S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, or M. catarrhalis in nasopharyngeal cultures benefit from antimicrobial treatment.",

Destruction of the ciliary epithelium was observed in 22 (46%) of the subjects, but it did not correlate with clinical outcomes. Earlier, 31% of adults have been reported to have bacterial pathogens in the nasal cavity during viral infection, 28 which is clearly lower than the present figure of 72%. Furthermore, we found NTHi to be the only culture-proven pathogenic bacterium in the maxillary sinus, whereas others have reported S. pneumonia and M. catarrhalis to be common as well. 11 The fact that our study was conducted among military recruits-among who NTHi is reported to be the most common nasal and paranasal pathogen 29,30 -probably explains these differences.",

We had a relatively small sample size due to our desire to collect sequential data on multiple variables, which would have been practically impossible with a larger cohort, considering our resources. Still, the sample size enabled us to find significant associations between the microbiological findings and the clinical outcomes. Despite the short recruitment period, we managed to collect our data during at least three larger virus epidemics (influenza A, adenovirus, picornavirus). Moreover, we used acknowledged methods to score the Fig. 2 . Symptom scores among 50 military recruits with acute rhinosinusitis. (A) Mean total symptom scores during the whole episode are higher among the subjects who had nontypable H. influenzae (NTHi) in the nasal middle meatus than among those who did not during the early phase of ARS (difference in average symptom scores, P 5.012). (B) Mean total symptom scores during the whole episode are similar, but the scores on the day of the second visit are higher among the subjects who had NTHi in the maxillary sinus than in those who did not or who did not undergo maxillary sinus puncture (difference in average symptom scores, P 5.19; difference in total symptom score on the day of the second visit, P 5.01). Total Symptom Score is calculated per day by adding up the scores (0-10) of facial pain/pressure, nasal obstruction, clear and purulent nasal discharge, postnasal discharge, and loss/reduction of smell (maximum score 60). Average Symptom Score (total symptom scores for each day added up from the onset of symptoms to the second visit and divided by the number of days). P values of the 2-tailed Mann Whitney U test. Bars represent standard deviations. Presence of H. influenzae in the nasal middle meatus during the early phase of acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) correlates with the spread of the disease to the paranasal sinuses among 50 military recruits (P 5.026). The spread of ARS was evaluated by dividing the subjects into groups according to the number of abnormal sinus findings (mucosal thickening > 3 mm, gas bubbles, or air-liquid level on the worst side) on cone-beam CT scans. P values were calculated with 2-tailed v 2 test. clinical outcomes. 5, 14 Both of these facts increase the generalizability of our findings.",
