KNHANES is a cross-sectional, population-based, nationwide survey conducted by the Division of Chronic Disease Surveillance of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Of the 20,698 participants who underwent dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA; QDR 4500A; Hologic Inc., Waltham, MA), 4,254 postmenopausal women were initially selected. After excluding participants with incomplete information on HT use, 4,233 postmenopausal women were enrolled, and the association between HT use and sarcopenia was assessed in this population. The KNHANES was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the KCDC (IRB No: 2008-04EXP-01-C, 2009-01CON-03-2C, 2010-02CON-21-C, and 2011-02CON-06C), and all participants provided written informed consent before participation.",

ASM/Wt was calculated as ASM divided by weight. Sarcopenia was defined as an ASM/Wt less than one standard deviation below the mean for healthy adults aged 20 to 39 years. The cut off value for sarcopenia in women was 25.6%.11,25 Body mass and height were measured by trained staff, and body mass index (BMI) was calculated as body mass (kg) divided by height squared (m2). Demographic and personal medical data were collected using standardized health questionnaires. The health interview was conducted by trained staff members, including physicians, medical technicians, and health interviewers. These data included reproductive factors (age at menarche, age at menopause, number of pregnancies, history of oral contraceptive [OC] use, and history of HT use), history of hypertension (HTN) and diabetes mellitus (DM), smoking history (current or ex-), and physical activity (walk/moderate/high). Nutrient status (total energy intake, protein intake, carbohydrate intake, and fat intake) was determined using a 24-hour dietary recall questionnaire.",

Complex Samples General Linear Model was used to evaluate the estimated mean of ASM and ASM/Wt among HT use groups.

Participants with a history of HT use were significantly younger than participants without a history of HT use. Mean BMI did not differ significantly among the three groups. Participants with a history of prolonged HT use were younger at menarche and older at menopause than participants in the other groups. Thus, duration of menstruation was significantly longer and duration of menopause was shorter in the prolonged HT use group. The number of pregnancies was lower in participants who received HT for 1 to 12 months than in participants who received no HT. History of OC use was significantly more frequent in participants with than without a history of HT use. Intake of nutrients, including intake of total energy, protein, carbohydrate, and fat, was significantly greater in participants with a prolonged history of HT use. Previous histories of DM and HTN were less frequent in participants who received HT for 1 to 12 months than in the other groups. The age of diagnosis of DM and HTN was older in non-HT users, but duration of DM and HTN was longer in non-HT users than in HT users. History of smoking and physical activity did not differ in the three groups. ASM and ASM/Wt were significantly higher, and the prevalence of sarcopenia was significantly lower, in participants with a prolonged history of HT use than in the other two groups.",

Although ORs were lower in all age and BMI subgroups that received HT for 13 months or more, statistical significance was observed only in postmenopausal women younger than 65 years or with BMI less than 25 kg/m2. These results suggest that the beneficial effects of HT use on sarcopenia may be more prominent in younger and leaner postmenopausal women. ORs of sarcopenia in participants with prolonged use of HT were, however, decreased, regardless of age and BMI, and the subgroups showing statistical significance included more participants with a history of HT use. Thus, the number of participants in these subgroups who received HT may contribute to statistical significance. In addition, the KNHANES did not assess whether participants who received HT did so currently or before the survey. Because use of HT was significantly associated with sarcopenia only in participants younger than 65 years, current use, but not previous use, may prevent the development of sarcopenia. The reasons for these associations remain unclear. Large-scaled cohort studies are required to confirm the effects of HT use on sarcopenia in older and/or obese postmenopausal women.",
