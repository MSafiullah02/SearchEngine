            "text": "Human zoonoses are directly acquired from animals or indirectly via arthropod bites and are an increasing public health problem. More than two\u2010thirds of emerging human pathogens are of zoonotic origin, and of them, more than 70% originate from wildlife (Cutler et al., 2010;One Health Initiative). Hunted wild animals are not only an important source of protein for many poor rural populations (Brashares et al., 2011); they are also an important part of some cultures, for animist practices or to reflect a luxury status in industrialized countries, for example. Usually composed of rodent\u2010borne, antelope\u2010borne, primate\u2010borne, and turtle\u2010borne meat, bushmeat is a threat to both biodiversity conservation of several endangered species such as primates and pangolins (Effiom et al., 2013) and public health. The traffic also contributes to decrease the proteins availability in some poor rural regions (Brashares et al., 2011). All industrialized countries are affected by the illegal traffic of bushmeat, as reported by Falk et al. in Switzerland (Falk et al., 2013) and by Bair\u2010Brake et al. (2014) in the United States. In 2013 in France, customs reported 647 seizures of endangered species (wildlife and flora), of which Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES)\u2010listed animals were estimated at 39% of seized bushmeat carcasses (Chaber et al., 2010, French customs annual report). The international illegal traffic of animals has been estimated to total five tons of wild game, livestock meat and fish, carried by passengers arriving from sub\u2010Saharan Africa at Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport (France) (Chaber et al., 2010), of which little is seized and directly destroyed by customs and veterinary services each year. Equivalent traffic probably occur from other countries (Asia or South American continents, for example), but no report was released yet regarding the detailed origins of customs seizures of illegal game entering in France.",

            "text": "In some countries, bats are hunted for their meat, resulting in the infection of humans, as previously reported (Kamins et al., 2014; Pernet et al., 2014). In addition, several known examples of primate hunting have led to the emergence of human epidemics, such as Ebola haemorrhagic fever and AIDS in which the hunting and manipulation of infected carcasses were shown to be the origins of epidemics (Wolfe et al., 2004). However, few studies have investigated the role of simian bushmeat trade, manipulation and/or consumption as a potential source of human infections. The carriage of pathogens by simian bushmeat, such as parasites (Pourrut et al., 2011), bacteria (Bachand et al., 2012) or viruses (Aghokeng et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2012), was previously reported. For example, in the United States, Smith et al. have reported the presence of retroviruses and herpesviruses in non\u2010human primate tissue samples confiscated at different airports (Smith et al., 2012). In France, Chaber et al. have reported data suggesting the presence of foodborne pathogens, such as Listeria monocytogenes, and carcinogenic concentrations of benzo(a)pyrene in smoked bushmeat confiscated at the Paris Charles de Gaulle and Toulouse Blagnac Airports (Chaber and Cunningham, 2016).",

Next\u2010generation sequencing (NGS) techniques make it possible to sequence all viral genomes in a given sample without any previous knowledge about their nature, using a combination of sequence\u2010independent amplification and high\u2010throughput sequencing. These techniques, which are known as viral metagenomics, are being used exponentially more frequently to characterize the viral diversities of complex environments, such as animal samples (Temmam et al., 2014). Although molecular\u2010biology\u2010based methods are not able to discriminate infectious or inactivated viral particles, PCR\u2010 and NGS\u2010based methods can provide crucial information onto the different viral species that are present in a sample. In this study, we report the first DNA and RNA viral metagenomic analysis and screening of zoonotic viral pathogens in illegally imported African simian bushmeat seized by French customs at Toulouse Blagnac Airport.",

However, illegal bushmeat traffic may contribute to the emergence and spread of infectious diseases in humans and need to be addressed. The origin of AIDS epidemics (Gao et al., 1999), case reports of hepatitis E originating from wild boars (Vasickova et al., 2007; Meng et al., 2009), brucellosis (CDC, 2009), Ebola previous epidemics (Pourrut et al., 2005) and trichinellosis (Roy et al., 2003) are some examples of foodborne illnesses acquired after hunting of wild animals (Karesh et al., 2012). Indeed, some human foodborne pathologies may either be caused by the consumption or during the preparation (i.e. butchering, cutting or washing) of meat originating from infected animals. In France, important quantities of meat enter illegally each year but only few are seized by customs (Chaber et al., 2010) because these are out of the priorities of customs officers. Moreover, since 2014 Ebola epidemics and the potential risks of contamination for customs workers, the difficulties to sample bushmeat for research purposes before their immediate destruction have increased. In this context, it is important to obtain the necessary support from relevant authorities to seize and analyse wild game before their destruction. A transparent partnership between customs and health authorities will provide the best opportunity for improving the effectiveness of efforts to control the risk of international bushmeat trade.",

Viral metagenomic analyses performed on the simian game showed that a large majority of the sequences were related to bacteriophages belonging to the Siphoviridae, Myoviridae and Podoviridae families. Regardless of infectivity, the bacterial hosts of these viruses mainly belong to the Firmicutes and Proteobacteria phyla, which include environmental bacteria in addition to potential human pathogenic species, such as some of the Staphylococcus sp., Listeria sp. and Enterococcus sp. For example, Cronobacter spp. (formerly Enterobacter sakazakii) includes a group of Gram\u2010negative bacteria ubiquitously found in the environment. Cronobacter spp. are particularly resistant to osmotic stress and elevated temperatures, explaining their ability to survive in a wide variety of dried foods, such as infant formulas (Edelson\u2010Mammel et al., 2005; Estuningsih et al., 2006). They are emerging foodborne pathogens (Estuningsih et al., 2006; Healy et al., 2010) that may be responsible for life\u2010threatening infections in newborns, immunocompromised adults and the elderly (Bowen and Braden, 2006; Gosney et al., 2006; Mullane et al., 2007; Than and Tang, 2007). The presence of Cronobacter and other pathogenic bacteria, and the risk of human infection caused by bushmeat manipulation and consumption have to be addressed. The source of bacterial contamination of the bushmeat, due, for example, to non\u2010hygienically handlings (during hunting, carcass evisceration, smoking treatments or during unsafe transportation conditions), or due to the presence of several bacteria in the original tissue samples, is actually unknown. But whatever the origin of micro\u2010organisms, their presence results in the same potential risk of transmission to humans. A recent study by Chaber et al. reported the detection of viable aerobic bacteria above levels considered safe for human consumption, and unsafe levels of carcinogens in fish (Chaber and Cunningham, 2016). An exhaustive inventory of the bacterial communities present in bushmeat samples, for example, by high\u2010throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and by isolation, would help to clarify and identify the potential risks of introducing emerging bacterial pathogens by the illegal import of bushmeat.",

Indeed, the detection limit for NGS techniques is estimated to be 103 to 104 genomic copies (Cheval et al., 2011; Frey et al., 2014), while PCR\u2010based methods, especially those based on a nested format, can detect up to one genomic copy. Moreover, analysis of the rarefaction curve of bushmeat metagenomes revealed a plateau (Figure S3), indicating that full sequence diversity and characterization were not achieved. Thus, we screened for the presence of several zoonotic viruses by pan\u2010generic PCR. No human viral pathogens were detected using the 12 pan\u2010generic PCRs targeting the most common viral zoonoses, although most PCRs were in nested format and presented low limits of detection. In addition, the control PCR targeting the 18S rRNA gene demonstrated that the negative results were not due to the presence of inhibitors and/or degraded nucleic acids after smoking treatments. These findings could suggest that either the twelve targeted viral genera were not present in the studied populations at the time of sampling or the viral particles and their genomic content were degraded during the smoking and drying of the bushmeat, resulting in their increased sensitivity to nucleases used to purify viromes. In addition, the small sampling size could explain this negative result, especially if a low prevalence of the targeted viruses occurs.",

Although smoking and thoroughly cooking the meat may reduce the risk of consumption, human contamination may still occur during handling infected meat that escaped sanitary controls. This risk is even higher for people manipulating and consuming fresh carcasses (Wolfe et al., 2005; Subramanian, 2012; Paige et al., 2014) which is of great concerns as international traffic of bushmeat also frequently involves fresh products. Large\u2010scale studies targeting the bacterial, viral and parasitic levels from wild\u2010caught game of different geographical and/or animal origins and, whenever possible, using large cohorts are urgently needed to identify risks for human health. These studies should be accompanied with extensive diffusion of information to exposed populations (regarding viral, bacterial and parasitic biohazard) about precautions that have to be taken while manipulating/consuming bushmeat. In addition, the effects of transformation treatments (such as smoking) on the external and internal contamination of meat have also to be addressed.",
