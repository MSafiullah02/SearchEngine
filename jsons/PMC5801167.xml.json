The World Health Organization estimates that seasonal influenza results in 3\u20135 million cases of severe illness and between 250,000 and 500,000 deaths annually worldwide (WHO, 2016). Avian influenza A(H5N1) and A(H7N9) viruses continue to circulate in some poultry populations and have caused intermittent human cases since 1997 (Chan, 2002) and 2013 (Gao et al., 2013) respectively. In addition, sporadic human cases of avian influenza A(H6N1) (Wei et al., 2013), A(H5N6) (Jiang et al., 2017), and A(H10N8) (Chen et al., 2014) have emerged in recent years. The number of different avian influenza viruses infecting humans is a concern because it increases the probability that a strain will acquire human-to-human transmission capability, making the emergence of an influenza pandemic more likely (Trombetta et al., 2015).",

Therefore, improving antivirals may not be a sufficient strategy by itself to minimize morbidity and mortality from severe influenza. Given the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis, the use of adjunctive immuno-modulating agents remains a topic of great interest (Hui et al., 2013). As many patients hospitalized with influenza are elderly subjects with co-morbid illness requiring drug treatment with some immuno-modulating properties (eg. statins, PPAR agonist, and COX-2 inhibitors), it is challenging to rely on retrospective observational studies in investigating the effects of these drugs on the clinical outcome in severe influenza. This review provides an update on the potential role of different immuno-modulatory agents and other adjunctive therapies in the management of patients hospitalized with severe influenza with a focus on the rationale and evidence for using these agents and their side effects. Agents with both an immunomodulatory effect and a direct antiviral effect are also discussed.",

            "text": "Except for a small number of studies (Kudo et al., 2012a, Diaz et al., 2012, Linko et al., 2011), the majority of observational studies have shown that corticosteroid therapy, often in the presence of some delay in initiation of NAI therapy, was associated with a higher risk of death, an increased rate of nosocomial pneumonia and developing critical disease compared with those who did not receive corticosteroid therapy (Martin-Loeches et al., 2011, Brun-Buisson et al., 2011, Kim et al., 2011, Han et al., 2011, Lee et al., 2015) (Table 1\n). While these studies did not adjust for baseline and time-varying confounders (such as worsening clinical status and the decision timing to start corticosteroid therapy), corticosteroid therapy should not be used alone for influenza treatment without antiviral cover (Han et al., 2011). Corticosteroids therapy may also increase risk of opportunistic infections such as invasive aspergillosis, as reported in two patients infected with A(H1N1)pdm09 virus who had received high dose corticosteroids for ARDS (Lat et al., 2010). Emergence of NA Arg292Lys mutation has been observed in two patients with A(H7N9) virus infection who had been given corticosteroid treatment that resulted in treatment failure and a fatal outcome (Hui et al., 2013). In addition, a retrospective cohort study of patients who received corticosteroid therapy for upper respiratory tract infections, allergies or spinal diseases has shown that within one month of drug commencement, there was an increase in rates of sepsis (incidence rate ratio 5.30, 95%CI 3.80 to 7.41), fracture (1.87, 1.69 to 2.07) and venous thromboembolism (3.33, 2.78 to 3.99), which decreased over the subsequent 2 months. At prednisone equivalent doses of <20 mg/day, the increased risk persisted (incidence rate ratio 4.02 for sepsis, 3.61 for venous thromboembolism, and 1.83 for fracture) (Waljee et al., 2017).",

For example, simvastatin did not reduce morbidity, mortality, or viral load of mice infected with either A(H1N1) or A(H5N1) viruses while a combination of simvastatin and oseltamivir did not improve the effectiveness of oseltamivir alone following infection with highly pathogenic avian A(H5N1) influenza virus in mice despite some reductions in lung cytokine production (Belser et al., 2013). In another study of mice infected with influenza A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) virus, simvastatin given orally or intra-peritoneally resulted in lower survival rates and in more distinct weight loss than virus-infected control mice. Furthermore, neither the viral load in lungs and tracheas nor histopathological lesions was reduced by simvastatin treatment (Gluck et al., 2013). Epidemiologic studies of patients on chronic statins when they developed influenza have yielded generally favorable results in terms of some protection against death and hospitalization (Kwong et al., 2009, Brett et al., 2011, Vandermeer et al., 2012, Laidler et al., 2015, Brassard et al., 2017) (Table 2b). In a study of the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink to identify all patients aged \u226530 years diagnosed with influenza-like illness during 1997\u20132010, including 5181 statin users matched to 5181 non-users, the 30-day incidence of hospitalization or death was 3.5% among statin users vs 5.2% in non-users, resulting in a 27% lower incidence with statin use (cumulative incidence ratio: 0.73, 95%CI: 0.59\u20130.89). However, the protective effect of statins was less certain among new users and those with concomitant chronic illness predisposing to influenza complications such as respiratory and cardiac disease. The data suggest that the beneficial effects of statins on influenza-related adverse outcomes may be due to a healthy user bias (Brassard et al., 2017).",

Apart from its clinically useful lipid-lowering activity, there is evidence that gemfibrozil (a PPAR-\u03b1 agonist) can inhibit production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Calkin et al., 2006). There are several studies (Budd et al., 2007, Bauer et al., 2010, Aldridge et al., 2009) based on the mice model that showed some anti-inflammatory effects of PPAR-\u03b3 agonist against influenza virus infection with survival advantage (Table 4\n). TNF inducible nitric oxide synthase producing dendritic cells (tipDC) accumulate in the lungs in significant numbers during lethal influenza infections, where they acquire, process, and present influenza antigen in the context of MHC class I antigen to CD8 T cells (Aldridge et al., 2009). During lethal influenza infections, the chemokines MCP-1 and MCP-3 accumulate to significantly higher levels in the airways, resulting in increased recruitment of tipDCs. Piglitazone diminishes tipDC recruitment, while allowing for protective CD8 T-cell expansion. Smoke exposure prior to influenza infection has been shown to increase lung inflammation with influenza infection (Robbins et al., 2006), and pioglitazone significantly attenuated the exaggerated inflammation observed in smoke-exposed influenza infected mice (Bauer et al., 2010).",

Tizoxanide inhibits the replication of influenza viruses at the post-translational level by selectively blocking the maturation of the viral hemagglutinin at a stage preceding resistance to endoglycosidase H digestion, thus impairing hemagglutinin intracellular trafficking and insertion into the host plasma membrane (Rossignol et al., 2009). Anti-inflammatory effects include upregulation of IFN and various IFN-inducible genes (Rossignol, 2014).

Early treatment with intraperitoneal pamidronate reduced morbidity and mortality of A(H7N9)-infected mice through controlling both viral replication and inflammation in affected lungs. Delayed treatment with pamidronate starting Day 3 after infection could still reduce disease severity in infected mice and improve chance of survival, whereas oral oseltamivir starting at the same time showed no therapeutic effects. Antiviral effects of pamidronate were partly mediated by IFN-\u03b3 secreted from human V\u03b42-T cells while human V\u03b42-T cells could directly kill virus-infected host cells in a perforin, granzyme B- and CD137- dependent manner (Zheng et al., 2015).",

In vitro, influenza A(H5N1) infection impaired alveolar fluid clearance much more than seasonal virus. This impairment is mediated by the release of soluble factors from infected cells, leading to down- regulation of alveolar Na+ and Cl\u2212 transporters. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) prevented or reduced this effect in vitro and in vivo in A(H5N1)-infected aged mice through secretion of soluble paracrine growth factors (Ang1 and KGF) (Chan et al., 2016). However, in C57Bl/6 mice that were infected with influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (mouse-adapted H1N1 virus) or influenza A/Mexico/4108/2009 (swine-origin pandemic H1N1 virus) and administered human or mouse MSCs via the tail vein, either pre- or post-infection, the regimen failed to improve survival, decrease pulmonary inflammation/inflammatory cell counts or prevent ALI. MSCs administered in combination with oseltamivir also failed to improve outcomes (Darwish et al., 2013). In another study of 6- to 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice that were infected intra-nasally with A(H9N2) virus to induce ALI, MSC treatment significantly reduced A(H9N2)-induced ALI and was associated with reduced pulmonary inflammation (Li et al., 2016). MSCs promote an anti-inflammatory and highly phagocytic macrophage phenotype through extracellular vesicle (EV)-mediated mitochondrial transfer in ARDS. MSC-induced changes in macrophage phenotype critically depend on enhancement of macrophage oxidative phosphorylation. Murine alveolar macrophages treated with MSC-derived EVs ameliorate lung injury in vivo (Morrison et al., 2017). More work is needed in the animal model (eg mice and ferrets) to examine the role of MSCs in combination with antiviral treatment for ALI in severe influenza.",

Interestingly, MMF inhibited A(H5N1) viral mRNA replication and protein expression completely for about 8 h in time-course assays following commencement of treatment. In addition, all mice survived while viral titers in lungs were markedly reduced by MMF treatment(Cho et al., 2017). The protective mechanism of MMF against A(H5N1) virus infection was due to inhibition of cellular inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) by exogenous guanosine, which inhibits viral mRNA and protein expression. Moreover, IFN-\u03b2, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IP-10 mRNA expression levels were substantially downregulated in MDCK cells with MMF treatment (Cho et al., 2017). It is important to note that while MMF has good inhibitory effect against Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus in vitro (Chan et al., 2013), all marmosets treated with MMF developed severe and/or fatal disease with higher mean viral loads than the untreated animals (Chan et al., 2015). More work is needed in mice and ferret models to understand the potential role of mycophenolic acid for treatment in severe influenza.",

Ephedra is the main ingredient of MY and the biological effects of MY are due to its ephedrine and pseudo-ephedrine content. Time to fever resolution was reduced by 19% (CI, 0.3%\u201334%; P= .05) when comparing oseltamivir + MY vs oseltamivir alone. However, there was no significant difference in symptom scores and data on serial viral kinetics were not available (Wang et al., 2011). Another RCT of patients aged 16\u201365 yrs with uncomplicated influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 found no significant differences between patients treated with herbal medicine Lianhuaqingwen capsule (LHC) or Oseltamivir in terms of the median duration of illness (LHC 69 h vs. Oseltamivir 85 h, p > .05) and the median duration of viral shedding (LHC 103 h vs. Oseltamivir 96 h, p > .05) (Duan et al., 2011). A Cochrane review of the role of Chinese Medicinal herbs for influenza based on 18 studies and 2521 participants has concluded that the methodological quality of the majority of studies was poor and more high quality RCTs with larger sample sizes are needed to evaluate the therapeutic role of herbal medicine (Jiang et al., 2013).",

Survival rates and survival time were improved in the group that received zanamivir, celecoxib, and mesalazine, compared to zanamivir alone. Significantly higher levels of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and less pulmonary inflammation were also noted in the group receiving the triple therapy. Zanamivir alone reduced viral load, but without any significant effect on lung inflammation or mortality. Mesalazine can inhibit both lipoxygenase and COX pathways, leading to reductions in pro-inflammatory cytokines and eicosanoids, and therefore deactivation of inflammatory cells such as macrophages and neutrophils.

The innate immune response to influenza viruses involves production of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2, which plays an important role in virus clearance during the initial stage of infection. In IFN \u03b1 receptor knock-out mice, type I IFNs are responsible for direct resolution of viral load and limitation of acute lung injury through suppression of immunopathology caused by influenza A virus via IL-10 production (Arimori et al., 2013). Low-dose IFN-\u03b1 protected mice against lethal A(H5N1) viral infection and was also effective against A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in vitro and in mice (Haasbach et al., 2011). An intro study has shown that antiviral agents with different mechanisms of action against seasonal influenza viruses (e.g., oseltamivir combined with IFN-\u03bb1) exerted a significantly greater synergistic effect than co-treatment with drugs that target the same signaling pathway (i.e., IFN-\u03b2 plus IFN-\u03bb1) in vitro (Ilyushina and Donnelly, 2014). Thus a combination of exogenous IFN plus oseltamivir may be a potential therapy for treating influenza infections.",

Several genes in the phosphatidylinositol 3\u2032-kinase (PI3K)-AKT-mTOR pathway have been shown to support broad-spectrum viral replication including influenza in vitro by RNA interference. Everolimus is a mTOR inhibitor which has in vitro antiviral activity against influenza A virus. In a lethal mouse infection model of influenza A (H1N1 and H5N1) virus infection, everolimus treatment (1 mg/kg/day) significantly delayed death although it could not prevent mortality. Histo-pathological findings showed decreased pulmonary hemorrhage and lung weights in everolimus treated mice in response to infection (Murray et al., 2012).",

Mice treated with sirolimus had more body weight loss during the illness, and a higher viral load on Day 10 than controls that did not receive sirolimus. However, there was a trend, suggesting lower lung inflammation score as seen in histology specimens (mean score 9.0 \u00b1 4.5 vs 11.5 \u00b1 4.5, p = .335), and improved compliance on mechanical ventilation in the mice that received sirolimus, consistent with drug-promoting apoptosis that lowered experimental lung injury associated with influenza infection (Alsuwaidi et al., 2017).",

Passive immunotherapy in the form of convalescent plasma or immune IVIG may be useful as an adjunct therapy for severe influenza, and definitive studies are ongoing. The triple combination of oseltamivir, clarithromycin, and naproxen for severe influenza was demonstrated to be effective in one RCT, but these findings need to be confirmed. Likewise, as sirolimus has been used with apparent benefit in critically ill influenza patients in the context of a RCT, confirmatory studies of this approach without concomitant corticosteroid therapy should be explored as a research priority. The efficacy of other agents with potential immunomodulating effects, including NAC, acute use of statins, macrolides, pamidronate, NTZ, IFNs, chloroquine, antiC5a antibody, human mesenchymal stromal cells, PPAR agonists, COX 2 inhibitors, mesalazine, herbal medicine, and the role of plasmapheresis and PMX hemoperfusion as rescue therapy, deserve more investigation preferably by RCTs. Systemic corticosteroids when administered in high dose may increase the risk of mortality and morbidity in patients with severe influenza and should not be used. The role of low dose systemic corticosteroid requires further evaluation as a research priority.",
