Lifestyle choices and unhealthy lifestyle habits, such as physical inactivity, an unhealthy diet, and smoking, are commonly linked to NCDs. If these chronic conditions are diagnosed at an early stage and adequate self-management strategies are applied, the prognosis can be good. Self-management of chronic disease entails an active role for patients, who must make day-to-day decisions to manage symptoms, treatment, physical and psychosocial consequences of the disease, and lifestyle changes [4]. Thus, self-management within long-lasting care is often individualized, goal-oriented, and facilitated in collaboration with HCPs [5]. Nevertheless, these patients will often depend on support from the health care system for the rest of their lives, and the likelihood that these patients will leave the health care service once they have entered is low. Patients that need long-term support thus represent a significant and growing strain on the system and on the involved HCPs.",

This is certainly the case for those living with chronic diseases, as patients are now expected to take an active role in their disease management: e.g. to follow medical regimes and comply with recommendations concerning lifestyle changes and adjustments in their daily lives. This requires that patients have easy access to information that is relevant to their specific situation. However, it may also challenge the HCP\u2019s role, as it represents a shift from a paternalistic approach, in which the HCP is the expert, to an approach in which the patient is acknowledged as an expert on his/her own life, with the right to make informed decisions regarding his/her self-management [6].

This definition of patient-centred care highlights the importance of clinicians and patients working together to produce the best possible outcomes. Several researchers are proponents of this concept; however, the question has also been raised how HCPs best should handle situations where a patient makes decisions that worsen disease outcomes [8, 9]. Repeated clinical encounters in which expectations regarding the patient role as expert are not met can contribute to this conflict, and possibly increase the already high strain and expectations placed on HCPs. Furthermore, the new HCP and patient roles are not necessarily thoroughly addressed during professional training. Thus, presumably HCPs must continuously balance their professional expertise with regards to responsibility and decision-making: taking responsibility and making decisions for the patient, or letting the responsibility lie with the patient, who may make decisions that include unhealthy behaviors.",

However, the three diseases also have clear differences in their treatment, their need for HCP follow up and prognosis over time, making them suitable to contrast the HCP experience. Thereby, we sought new insights that could aid HCPs, policymakers, and educational institutions in reducing the strain on HCPs and preventing burn-out among HCPs.

The members of the research group had all worked in clinical and research settings with patients with a range of chronic diseases. Whereas most of the nurses had insider knowledge from their clinical work and research on diabetes, COPD, or CKD, the physiotherapists had an outsider perspective, as their experiences related mainly to chronic musculoskeletal disorders. These differences nurtured our discussions during the whole process. In order to enhance the researcher\u2019s reflexivity, shifting pairs of researchers worked together in all phases of the review process of inclusion/exclusion, appraising the methodological quality, extracting the data for further analysis, and analyzing the data.

In addition, one domain from the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative research (COREQ) was applied to capture methodological orientation and theory [16]. Working in pairs, the papers were first independently appraised by two researchers, before each pair met and discussed their appraisal, and the results were discussed by the group until consensus was reached about how we interpreted the items and came to a conclusion. Papers of poor quality was not excluded, as papers with poor conceptual development are considered to contribute less to the results [17, 18]. We argue that a methodological appraisal of the included papers is most valuable for describing the methodological quality to inform methodological discussions for future studies.",

It was not necessarily easy for HCPs to provide individualized care and recognize the person behind the diagnosis. HCPs tolerated being given inaccurate information from their patients, in order to establish and maintain contact and build positive relationships with them [28, 37]. Other HCPs, in contrast, rarely asked for personal details from their patients, as they did not see the need to do so [21, 29].

For example, it was a challenge to advocate diet adjustments to patients with kidney failure who had not yet experienced symptoms [36].

Ethnic minorities were perceived by HCPs as more difficult to reach and cooperate with than most other patients.

In particular, conducting consultations in which the HCP was dependent upon a translator complicated the patient\u2013provider relationship [40].

However, a long-term patient\u2013provider relationship could also lead to negative personal relationships with patients [24]. If the relationship was poor, it could become challenging for HCPs to provide individualized care. Nurses working with hemodialysis handled this by maintaining a professional and emotional distance from their patients, for example, by simply accepting the patients\u2019 demands; others felt pride when they successfully managed the more difficult relationships [28]. In some cases, HCPs decided to transfer the responsibility for the treatment of a patient to a colleague [23]. In others, HCPs stayed in the struggle, and ultimately developed a better understanding of why the patients appeared to be so difficult [35]. Accordingly, clinical encounters could cause stress, frustration, and tension among the HCPs. However, there were also positive aspects of having personal relationships with patients. One example from a renal ward highlights how doctors valued their long-term, friendly relationships with patients throughout the process of renal failure and dialysis, in which they could share their patients\u2019 joy when conditions improved: for example, when a kidney transplantation was successful [30]. However, patients could also die, and if the HCPs had established a positive relationship with their patients, they mourned their loss. This was made more challenging by the fact that their professional role dictated that they push their feelings aside, to better support the families and other patients who had been close to the deceased [23].",

Over time, HCPs could become desensitized to others, and dehumanization could begin as early as, for example, medical school [35]. There was also a risk that providing patient care based on routine would be prioritized over providing individualized care. Despite routine and dehumanized care, when patients were unstable or did not follow advice, HCPs expressed a variety of emotions, including sadness, powerlessness, aggression, sympathy, frustration, and irritation. Even the most experienced HCPs reported feelings of guilt when they were unable to make patients follow their therapeutic recommendations [33]. When the emotional engagement with their patients became overwhelming, it was a challenge for HCPs to keep their frustrations from spilling over into their relationships with their patients\u2014this was especially true when HCPs were faced with patients with limited coping abilities or those who complained over minor issues [35].",

A lack of professional autonomy, in turn, made providing care more difficult and less effective; however, the nurses felt that the hierarchical system in which they worked constrained their professional autonomy, making them feel they occupied a subordinate position within the hospital hierarchy. Some nurses were afraid to express their opinions and bring up critical issues related to their work [37]. Abdulhadi [21] remarked that a heavy workload, lack of teamwork, and lack of support from superiors in a hierarchical health care system decreased HCPs\u2019 trust in the system: doctors, in particular, reported feeling a lack of trust in their co-workers\u2019 competence. Bostr\u00f6m et al. [22] showed how diabetes specialist nurses found their autonomy and self-determination hampered by being frequently told to assist others in their work.",

This support could take different forms, through professional discussions in multidisciplinary teams or on a one-to-one basis, and was, if successful, based on a mutual respect for one another and a shared understanding of the challenges to be solved. Receiving support from colleagues was described as stimulating [40], enabling HCPs to take on more responsibilities [37].

At the same time, the democratization of health care services has led to increasing user and patient involvement in all stages of illness, including when the patient is diagnosed with a chronic disease [6, 41]. The patient-centered model of care is part of the user involvement movement and has gained attraction in Western societies. This is meant to counteract the paternalism embedded in the clinicians\u2019 traditional role as sole expert, and to support patients in being active agents regarding the health issues that concern their own lives [6]. However, how patient-centered care should be practiced within the context of the public management and evidence-based practice ideals is rarely, if ever, addressed by research. Our analysis suggests that this balancing act can be complex for HCPs and can create several challenges. This is in line with Holen and Kamp [41], who discuss how user involvement has transformed the relationship between patients and HCPs, and how HCPs today face new dilemmas and challenges. Of particular interest, and in keeping with findings from our study, the authors describe how in long-term patient\u2013provider relationships\u2014e.g. between COPD patients and nurses\u2014\u201cnew\u201d professionalism contains relational, emotional and pedagogical aspects to motivate and coach patients. The main aim of this \u201cnew\u201d approach is to support the patient in taking responsibility for and self-managing his/her health in a time-efficient way.

HCPs feel they lack the tools or ability to help patients and family members understand the risks of not following the prescribed treatment plan. In this way, HCPs feel they are to blame by not fulfilling their professional responsibility.

As our analysis indicates, this can also be a balancing act, as HCPs know that just as the progression of a disease is uncertain, so is the outcome.

There is no formula for how to perform this balancing act in practice, as it is usually individually and situationally determined.",

We found traces of these aspects in our study and agree with the authors that more research to understand and improve the work lives and wellbeing of HCPs is needed. Our findings do indicate, however, that supportive colleagues and leaders, as well as acknowledgement and support from leaders within the health organization, can be helpful. This approach can help meet HCPs\u2019 support needs, and empower them\u2014in various ways and at different levels\u2014to remain in highly complex work situations. We also argue that educational institutions have the responsibility to prepare future HCPs to meet this complexity of clinical practice. As far as we know, this issue is largely absent in today\u2019s curricula.",

One strength of this meta-synthesis is that we conducted comprehensive searches of six databases, and thereby generated a variety of data to be analyzed. By choosing three different chronic diseases on which to focus, we succeeded to find richness and variability in HCPs\u2019 detailed working experiences. Furthermore, the inclusion and exclusion criteria and search terms were decided in advance of the literature search, and the searches were conducted by an experienced librarian. Another strength of our meta-synthesis is that the study selection, study appraisals, extractions of data in primary studies to be analyzed and coding were performed independently by pairs of researchers, and the use of NVivo further ensured a rigorous and systematic process. In this part of the process, we followed procedures to ensure reliability in line with a realist perspective [42]. In the analysis, however, we followed an interpretive approach inspired by meta-ethnography and a constructivist stance [42]. This enabled us to take advantage of the various theoretical competencies in the research group. The credibility of the analysis depends on how transparent we present our analysis. We have attempted to describe our data material in the result section as close as possible and with reference to the original papers (second order data). Our overall interpretation of the data (third order level) is presented in the discussion in order to make the correspondence between the descriptions in our result section and our further interpretations transparent. We argue that our shifts between rigorous methodological approach and reflexivity based on our various perspectives and understandings during the whole process have strengthened the trustworthiness of this study. Therefore, it is likely that it is a balancing act to work with diabetes-1, COPM and CKD. Furthermore, we think the complexity and dilemmas raised in these studies are likely to be transferable to the work with other chronic diseases as well.",

Firstly, according to the quality appraisal, as assessed by the CASP and COREQ, the quality of the original articles can be considered high. However, wider methodological orientations or broader philosophical backgrounds were rarely presented or discussed in the included papers. It is also possible that the assumptions made by the authors of the original studies were continued in the meta-synthesis. Secondly, it is noteworthy that although we welcomed both interview studies and observational studies in the meta-synthesis, no observational studies met our inclusion criteria. This implies a knowledge gap, as the HCP\u2013patient relationship and their interactions require research from different vantage points. Thus, further research to examine how clinical practice is performed and contextualized is needed.",

On the other hand, they also experience the creation and maintenance of long-term relationships with patients with chronic conditions as personally and professionally rewarding. As such, HCPs must find the balance between personal closeness to and professional distance from patients. They must also balance providing patient-centered care whilst simultaneously developing and strengthening their professional expertise. This underscores the importance, for HCPs, of having systematic support from colleagues, leaders, educational institutions, and health organizations.",
