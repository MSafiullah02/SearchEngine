All patients in India and China were randomized to both parts of the trial (n = 15,570 patients), whereas those from Pakistan were only included in the GIK component (total of 20,201 patients). All patients presenting with suspected AMI and ST-segment elevation or new left bundle branch block within 12 hours of symptom onset, and who were without contraindications to heparin or GIK and who provided written consent or witnessed oral consent were randomized (Figure 2\n-Study design flow chart). It was recommended that study drugs be initiated within 15 minutes of thrombolytic therapy. The dose of Reviparin or placebo was weight-based. Patients < 50 kg received 3436 IU antiXa Ph Eur units* of Reviparin every 12 hours subcutaneously; those between 50\u201375 kg received 5153 IU antiXa Ph Eur units* every 12 hours; and those > 75 kg received 6871 IU antiXa Ph Eur units* every 12 hours. Drugs and placebo were provided by Abbott Laboratories. In patients undergoing primary PTCA, open-label unfractionated heparin could be used for up to 24 hours, with study medication being initiated thereafter, 1 hour after removal of the sheath. All other non-study thrombin inhibitors were not allowed, unless there was a clinical need, in which case blinded-study medication was discontinued.",

            "text": "This study has been a formidable undertaking and has been successful in recruiting the overall target of 20 000 patients. The lack of external funding required that investigator meetings were generally attached to other meetings, although annual regional meetings were held in India and China. The centers in ECLA were not provided with any compensation and the centers in CREATE (India, China, and Pakistan) received modest compensation per patient to cover their visible costs. Despite this, over the last 2 years of the study, recruitment rates averaged 7000 patients per year. The National Coordinating Centers obtained national regulatory approvals and licences for drug imports. These processes were extremely bureaucratic and slow (9\u201318 months in each country), and were chiefly designed to be done by pharmaceutical companies or independent contract research organizations (CRO) at considerable expense. A quote from a CRO in India for obtaining approval and monitoring the trial exceeded the entire cost of running the study in India (note that, in most countries, there is no streamlined and efficient mechanism to obtain regulatory approvals for studies conducted independent of industry). Several of the participating centers did not have institutional review boards (IRBs) or ethics committees, so national and independent IRBs had to be used. There were considerable initial delays in receiving the packaged drugs (Reviparin/placebo) from the company, which was in the midst of a takeover, and the study was not considered to be of sufficiently high priority within the new organization. For most centers, the CREATE study was the first trial in which they had participated, so considerable training (at small study meetings and by phone) was needed. Despite their enthusiasm and the relative simplicity of the study, some centers initially had problems with accurate completion of forms, complying with certain aspects of the study protocol, and maintaining careful documents. Therefore, we instituted a system of on-site monitoring and training which trained staff at sites in CREATE, and provided support. This improved protocol adherence and data quality considerably. For randomization in India, the study initially used sealed envelopes (due to lack of low-cost, reliable and accessible telephone lines 24 hours-a-day at all hospitals). Despite multiple safeguards, allocation errors occurred in a few patients. Therefore, despite higher costs, randomization was switched to a 24-hour central telephone system in Bangalore, India, which substantially reduced the allocation error rate. In China, 24-hour central randomization was used throughout, and so few errors occurred.",

This substantially slowed recruitment into ECLA so that, instead of the original target of 10 000 patients over 3 years, only 4000 patients were randomized over 6 years. This was less of a problem in India and China, where only a few centers stopped randomizing by the end of 2003 to participate in other trials. Nevertheless, most centers had made important contributions to the trial. During 2003, the epidemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in China adversely affected recruitment and several participating hospitals were closed down, or stopped admitting AMI patients.",

            "text": "What lessons have we learned from the CREATE-ECLA experience and collaboration? First, if important generic questions are incorporated into a very simple protocol, sufficient numbers of physicians are still willing and able to collaborate at little or no reimbursement. Second, the \u201cmerger\u201d of CREATE and ECLA was possible because of long-standing previous collaboration between the investigators from the 2 groups, and a mutual commitment to sharing credit. This led to ensuring a statistically robust, reliable result regarding GIK, rather than the potential for an inconclusive result from the ECLA study alone. Third, the bureaucratic hurdles for conducting this trial in India and China were formidable and took between 9\u201318 months to overcome, chiefly through the tenacity, determination and dedication of the National Coordinators in Beijing and Bangalore. Fourth, even in a very simple trial, some streamlined and sensible (\u201chelpful and supportive\u201d as opposed to \u201cpolicing\u201d) monitoring could help in improving study quality, especially when centers had not previously participated in trials. Fifth, much of the increasing regulatory bureaucracy imposed by guidelines such as the \u201cGood Clinical Practice\u201d guidelines may not enhance the quality of the study or improve patient safety more than careful attention to a few key aspects of study design, conduct (such as proper randomization and complete and unbiased outcome ascertainment), and periodic review of the data by an independent DSMB. In fact, there is a danger that these well-intentioned guidelines could prevent the conduct of important low-cost academic trials of generic (non-pharmaceutical) questions by imposing burdensome and expensive processes which may be of little scientific, medical, or ethical value. Sixth, peer review and governmental organizations should develop mechanisms to support international trials and epidemiologic studies. Current funding mechanisms do not generally support such studies in multiple countries, especially if they are low- or middle-income countries.",

These therapies, if proven to be effective, could be used even in small medical centers in low- and middle-income countries. The practical experiences in conducting this trial indicate how large trials of important questions can be successfully conducted in resource-poor settings, by academic groups without industry involvement. However, such studies are uncommon and, therefore, a large number of important questions remain unaddressed. This emphasizes the need to develop funding structures and regulations that will facilitate global low-cost trials of important public health questions.",
