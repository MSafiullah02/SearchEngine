The nasal bridge was the most commonly affected site (83.1%). As expected, frequent hand hygiene was associated with a higher incidence of hand dermatitis, but the length of time wearing the face shield was not significantly associated with the risk of facial lesions. It was not the N95 mask alone but rather goggles that were implicated in most injuries.",

Skin disease accounts for a large proportion of occupational injury and days lost from work, with health care workers reporting a high incidence of occupational skin disease.",

We can learn from the experience of those who have fought this infection on the front lines. The prevalence of skin disease related to protective equipment is high, and simple interventions, including the use of adhesive barrier films before donning protective gear, may help preserve the workforce vital for caring for patients with the disease.",
