            "text": "An estimated 50\u2013100 million people are infected with dengue virus (DENV) yearly, mostly in southern Asia and northern Latin America. Infection with DENV causes a spectrum of outcomes that can be grouped into four categories of increasing clinical severity: infection with no symptoms, undifferentiated fever, classic dengue fever (DF) and dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF).1 Those afflicted with the latter two categories exhibit overt symptoms and usually seek medical attention. The WHO estimates that DF and DHF together result in ~500 000 hospitalizations and 15 000 deaths per year (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs117/en/). However, the total number of people with debilitating illness caused by DENV is likely in the tens of millions annually. Currently, no vaccine or effective therapeutic to prevent or treat DF/DHF is commercially available. Several promising DENV vaccine approaches have been reported recently2\u20134 and some are currently being evaluated in human clinical trials (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov). Several small molecules and monoclonal antibodies have produced promising results in drug development studies against DENV.2 In addition, nucleic-acid-based strategies employing C-5 propyne-substituted phosphorothioate oligonucleotides5 and small interfering RNA6 have both been shown to suppress DENV replication in mammalian cell culture. However, at the time of writing, no clinical trials registered with the United States Food and Drug Administration for a therapeutic agent to treat DENV infections are in progress (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov).",

Various strains of each serotype can cause severe disease. The four serotypes of DENV form a single species in the genus Flavivirus of the family Flaviviridae.7 The DENV genome is an \u223c11 kb single-stranded RNA molecule of positive polarity, containing a single open reading frame (ORF) flanked by 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs). The ORF is translated into a single polyprotein that is co- and post-translationally cleaved to produce 10 mature viral proteins. The UTRs contain conserved sequences and structures that have important roles in the regulation of many aspects of the viral life cycle, including translation, RNA synthesis and virion assembly.8,9",

Their adaptive immune system is considered to be functional, however, and they have been used successfully as a model system for DENV vaccine development.11,12 Certain strains of mouse\u2010adapted DENV-2 can cause viraemia and can be detected at high titres in a number of tissues after intraperitoneal (ip) administration in AG129 mice.11,13,14 AG129 mice infected with neuroadapted DENV-2 strain New Guinea C (NGC) or DENV-1 Mochizuki strain typically suffer 100% mortality by day 18 post-infection.11,12,15 Recently, Schul et al.14 showed that ip administration of unadapted DENV-2 can produce transient viraemia in AG129 mice and that antiviral drug candidates could be evaluated for their effect on viraemia and cytokine levels through blood testing.",

We found that PPMO targeting the DENV 5\u2032-terminal and 3\u2032-cyclization sequence region were effective in vivo, extending the average survival of DENV-2-infected AG129 mice by up to 8 days. Further, we compared PPMO of various lengths in cell cultures designed against either the 5\u2032SL- or 3\u2032CS-regions for anti-DENV efficacy, and found that PPMO of 22\u201324 bases were more effective than shorter or longer PPMO targeting the same regions. Pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that PPMO distributes readily into liver and can persist there for at least 5 days. Several toxicological analyses indicated that repeated ip dosing of PPMO, at 10 mg/kg, did not have deleterious effects on the health of non-infected mice.",

First, we evaluated the effect of the prospective dosing regimen on the health of non-infected animals. Intraperitoneal administration of PMO to mice has been reported to produce no detectable toxicity, even at high doses.23 It is generally accepted that toxicity caused by PPMO is due to the peptide component, and therefore we considered evaluation of a single PPMO compound as representative of the off-target effects likely to result from any PPMO under the employed regimen. Groups of mice were treated twice (24 h apart) with PBS, 380 \u00b5g of DScr PMO or 240 \u00b5g of DScr PPMO, and found to suffer no weight loss or apparent ill-effects for the ensuing 35 days of monitoring (data not shown). After establishing this subtoxic dosing regimen with non-infected animals, the same regimen with PMO or PPMO was employed in an in vivo viral inhibition challenge. Figure 2(a) shows the survival of mice treated once before and once after infection with 106pfu DENV-2 NGC. Of the six PMO or PPMO evaluated, two generated a statistically significant extension of survival. Compared with the PBS-treated group, members of the 5\u2032SL 20-mer and 3\u2032CS 18-mer PPMO-treated groups survived an average of 8 and 5 days longer (P = 0.009 and 0.006), respectively (Figure 2a and b). Three of the four mice treated with the 5\u2032SL 20-mer PPMO were still alive on day 16, whereas three of four mice in the PBS- or DScr PPMO-treated groups had died by day 9. Furthermore, the 5\u2032SL PPMO group showed little, and 3\u2032CS-PPMO group only moderate, weight-loss through day 14 (Figure 2c), reflective of the enhanced survival observed.",

Cells were incubated with 1 \u00b5M 5\u2032SL PPMO-Fl of 18, 24 or 30 bases in length (Figure 1) for 4 h under experimental conditions similar to those used in the antiviral experiments of Figure 3, and the presence of fluorescein was then evaluated by flow cytometry. We observed that all three PPMO entered over 95% of the cells and that each PPMO-Fl produced nearly identical signal intensity. No differences between the cell entry characteristics of the three PPMO-Fl were observed (data not shown).",

As for the first antiviral in vivo experiment, a preliminary toxicity evaluation of a prospective dosing regimen was carried out with non-infected AG129 mice. Groups of six AG129 mice were treated ip once a day for 9 days consecutively with PBS or 5\u2032SL 22-mer PPMO, and their weight and appearance monitored for 5 weeks. No weight loss occurred in either group over the duration of the monitoring period (Figure 4a). For the second viral inhibition challenge, all groups of mice, except one, received two PBS- or PPMO-treatments before and seven treatments after infection with 104pfu of DENV-2 NGC. One group received no pre-infection treatments, but only the seven post-infection treatments with 5\u2032SL 22-mer PPMO. Mice receiving pre- and post-infection treatments of 5\u2032SL 22-mer lived, on average, 7 days longer, and those on 5\u2032SL and 3\u2032CS combination treatment lived ~8 days longer than PBS-treated controls (P = 0.03 and 0.006, respectively). The 3\u2032CS 22-mer treatment group and the group receiving the 5\u2032SL 22-mer with only post-infection treatments outlived the PBS controls by ~6 and 4 days, respectively; the results that were not statistically significant (Figure 4b). The average survival of the PBS-treated mice was several days longer in this experiment (Figure 4b) than in the first in vivo experiment (Figure 2b), probably because of the lower challenge dose of the NGC virus used. In a previous unrelated experiment, AG129 mice survived an average of 9.0 \u00b1 1.0 and 13.8 \u00b1 2.5 days following ip challenge with DENV-2 NGC at doses of 6 and 4 log10 pfu, respectively (Richard Kinney, unpublished results). All the mice in the PBS- or DScr PPMO-treated groups died by day 17, whereas half the mice in each of the 5\u2032SL, 3\u2032CS, and 5\u2032SL and 3\u2032CS combination groups lived until day 22\u201324. Body weight measurements reflected the relatively stable health of the surviving animals at day 21 (Figure 4d).",

A 20-mer 5\u2032SL or 18-mer 3\u2032CS PMO produced no significant treatment benefit, whereas 20-mer 5\u2032SL or 18-mer 3\u2032CS PPMO treated mice showed a statistically significant increase in survival time (Figure 1). 5\u2032SL and 3\u2032CS PPMO of various lengths were then compared in cell culture for anti-DENV efficacy. PPMO of 22\u201324 bases were found to be the most effective, and able to reduce viral titres by several orders of magnitude when present at 1 \u00b5M in the cell culture medium. This antiviral effect was also greater than that reported previously for 5\u2032SL 20-mer and 3\u2032CS 18-mer PPMO that had been made with a different CPP (\u2018P4\u2019). In that earlier report, at 1 \u00b5M concentration, the P4-PMO exhibited no antiviral activity against DENV-2 D2/IC-30P-A virus in Vero cell cultures.22 5\u2032SL and 3\u2032CS 22-mer PPMO, which had produced high efficacy in the length versus activity evaluation, were then used in a second mouse study. With a higher number of doses and a longer time period over which dosing occurred than were employed in the first in vivo experiment, survival benefit of the antisense PPMO-treated groups again extended to an average of ~1 week. For the second in vivo experiment, we had hypothesized that employing a greater number of doses with PPMO of more effective length during the first week post-infection, concomitant with a lower (but still severe) DENV-2 NGC challenge dose, would limit viral replication sufficiently to permit development of a fully protective anti-DENV-2 immune response. The PBS-treated group lived an average of 14 days in the second experiment compared with 9 days in the first experiment. In both experiments the effective PPMO produced up to a 7\u20138 day extension of survival time, and protection from DENV-induced weight loss for a period of about a week compared with controls (Figures 1 and 3).",

The results here strongly suggest that 5\u2032SL and 3\u2032CS PPMO treatments suppressed viral titres in vivo for a period of several days, but that residual virus was able to rebound a number of days after treatment cessation. A similar pattern was also observed in the cell culture studies reported here and previously.22 An alternate, and likewise untested, hypothesis is that virus resistant to the effects of the PPMO arose over time in response to the treatments. To date, however, there have been no reports in the literature of viral mutations arising in response to PPMO treatment in animals. Other investigators have sequenced virus from mice that had been treated with PPMO highly active in vivo against WNV23 and PV,24 and found no mutations in the PPMO-targeted regions. Our current in vivo experiments did not include enough animals to evaluate the amount or sequence of virus in blood or tissues.",

Although this result indicates that early intervention with PPMO is necessary for maximum protective effect, it is not possible from these experiments to conclude whether this type of technology will ultimately be clinically useful. The pathogenesis of DF/DHF in humans is characterized by a wide variety of clinical progressions, including subsets of patients who remain viraemic and harbour virus in their tissues for periods of time beyond the onset of symptoms.3 Considering the large number of total cases of DF/DHF, it is likely that an agent that effectively reduces virus replication in a non-toxic manner would find utility.",

Although the binding affinity of an oligonucleotide to single strand nucleic acid, as reflected by melting point temperature, increases as a function of oligonucleotide length, a number of other design factors can affect the functional performance of an antisense oligomer.39,40 It was previously shown that PPMO targeted to the DENV 5\u2032 terminus can interfere with translation,21 and that the corresponding PPMO can interfere with WNV translation20 and RNA 5\u2032 capping reactions.41 3\u2032CS-directed PPMO have been shown to interfere with RNA synthesis in DENV21 and WNV.20 Thus, PPMO targeting the 5\u2032SL and 3\u2032CS regions likely work by interfering in different aspects of the viral life cycle. Despite the different mechanisms of action, the most effective PPMO from both panels were of similar length.",

            "text": "Because of the limited number of AG129 mice available to us, we used BALB/c mice for PK/toxicity analysis. A P7-PMO-Fl compound has previously been shown to be stable in human serum for at least 2 h.30 Here, the PK profile was based on plasma concentration data monitored over 24 h following a single ip injection. Peak plasma concentration was observed at a Tmax of 0.67 h following injection, which is indicative of rapid transfer from the site of injection to the vascular space. The observed distribution half-life of ~3 h, a high volume of distribution (Vd) and AUC, and detectable levels of PPMO-Fl observed in brain, liver and spleen at 0.2 h (10 min) post-dose all indicate that the PPMO-Fl distributed fairly rapidly into tissues. Tissue to plasma concentration ratios in liver (2.43) and spleen (0.72) at the Tmax provided a further indication that the PPMO-Fl rapidly penetrated into these tissues. Of the three tissues tested, liver was observed to be the primary site of accumulation, with brain accumulating minimal amounts of the compound. We assume that the higher perfusion of liver (11.8 mL/min in rats) compared to spleen (0.6 mL/min) and brain (1.3 mL/min)42 contributed to the observed pattern. We attribute the low cerebral uptake to the presence of the blood brain barrier. As shown in Figure 6(b), the level of PPMO-Fl in brain, liver and spleen did not change significantly for 3\u20135 days following the cessation of the 9 day treatment period. This observation indicates that these tissues retained the compound, and provides useful information for prospective dosing frequency in future studies. Although the liver is not considered a major target organ for DENV replication, the involvement of the liver in the pathogenesis of DENV infection has been documented.43,44 DENV antigens and RNA have been detected in various cells of the liver in humans.43,44",

The only significant changes in serum chemistry or haematology during or after treatment were elevated serum cholesterol and a decrease in haematocrit, haemoglobin, packed cell volume and red blood cell (RBC) count. However, these changes did not appear to impact the overall health of the animals, and all of these indices reverted to levels comparable with the untreated control during the 5 day washout period, as shown in Figure 7. The fact that total bilirubin was not altered during the treatment period suggests that the observed decrease in red blood cell count, haematocrit and packed cell volume was a result of interference with red blood cell production rather than haemolysis of these cells. These data demonstrate that the DENV 5\u2032SL PPMO possesses a favourable safety profile and kinetic behaviour. The data from this study will likely prove useful during the design of future in vivo studies with PPMO.",
