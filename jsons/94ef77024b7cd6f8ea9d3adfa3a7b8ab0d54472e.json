These parameters are defined for a given pathogen in a defined host population. The data needed to estimate these parameters are the contact rate between hosts, the transmission probability resulting from these contacts and the infectiveness of the pathogen in the target host or the probability that such a contact occurs between an infected and a susceptible host (McCallum et al. 2001 ).

A posteriori, after an outbreak, these parameters can be estimated if the relevant data has been timely collected. This data concerns repeated data collection on a pre-determined sample of the animal population and the setting-up of the appropriate environment in which the samples will be adequately stored until laboratory testing. Applied to the wildlife/livestock interface, estimating these parameters is difficult in free-ranging species (Morgan et al. 2006 ). Capture of wild species is often expensive, implemented in extreme conditions not suitable for sample conservation and unrealistic when the activity needs to be repeated in time on the same animals. Real and Biek (2007) suggest a possible framework using telemetry (radio and satellite) on wild species combined with sampling survey on wild and domestic species. However they identify limits such as the underestimation of the quantity of contacts if the entire wild population is not marked. Richomme et al. (2006) estimated by direct observations the contact rate and exposure between a domestic ungulate and a wild mountain ungulate and discuss additional limits of such data for the inference of EIs because of the nocturnal behaviour of wild species which cannot be apprehended. The necessity to include in the study the respective sensibility of each species to the pathogen requires also an extrapolation from available data on closely-related species. The role of modelling has been and will be crucial in the estimation of the behaviour of transmission parameters and their interpretation (Lloyd-Smith et al. 2009) . A model allows playing with variables to estimate outcomes impossible to observe in the field. They use the available data to test hypotheses which would be too complex or too costly to test in experimental conditions. Multi-host models have been developed under the form of meta-population pathogen diffusion process in the particular case of multi-host meta-population (Arino et al. 2005) . Recently, transmission models of multi-strains with differential transmission pathways (with emphasis on the role of the environment) paved the way for multipathogen models (Roche and Rohani 2010) . However, the integration of multi-host and multi-pathogen models has yet to be done.

The main assumption of the research framework is that the emerging pathogen will use contacts between hosts which have already been used by other pathogens. The higher the intensity of EI, the higher the probability of the emerging pathogen to use it.

Host movements and contacts can be monitored using different field techniques adapted to the level of study: individual, population or community. Few empirical studies have considered contacts at the wildlife/livestock interface. At the individual host level, direct observation or telemetry can detect and quantify these contacts. For example, the development of satellite telemetry and the increase capacity of miniature batteries allow the study of animal movements with a large range of body sizes: up to a few grams for birds (Gaidet et al. 2008 ) at a very fine time-scale (up to a point every 5 mn) for long periods (a year or more). Recent examples combining telemetry and density or visual observation techniques have successfully determined contact rate of individuals at the wildlife/livestock interface (Legendre et al. 1994; Bohm et al. 2009 ). The main weakness of these studies is the underestimation of contacts as it can never be assumed that the entire non-target population has been identified. This weakness can be partially controlled by objective or subjective knowledge of the study site but can never be completely addressed. At the population or community level, estimates of overlaps in habitat used by different host populations or species (Ezenwa 2003; Poulin 2007a) can be utilised as a proxy of interspecies contacts at different seasons. Data collected during road-counts or counts focusing on key resources or habitat (such as waterholes) on both sides of the interface, as well as trapping data (Caley and Hone 2004) provide a quantitative estimate of interspecies interactions which can be used to build an EI network. A recent study attempted to estimate EIs in avian communities using bird count data in wild and domestic sites to predict the risk of Avian Influenza transmission at the wildlife/domestic interface ).

Large datasets of parasites (mostly macroparasites) in multi-hosts systems have been collected in the course of these studies (see Poulin 2007b) . Several indices have been used to compare parasite communities between host populations (Poulin 2003 (Poulin , 2010 . The Jaccard index (Jaccard 1912 ) uses presence-absence data of parasites in different host populations to give an indicator of the similarity of this community. Other indices, more sophisticated, use prevalence data to compare parasite community (Boyle et al. 1990; Poulin 2007b) . In the context of host populations from the same ecosystem, the geographic distance between the host populations is controlled (geographic distances usually looked at in parasite community ecology are of the order of hundreds or thousands of kilometres).

These indices can therefore be used to build EI network as the value of the index between two parasite communities shared by two host populations (their similarity).

Another example is the abundant recent literature on phylogenetic analyses of HPAI H5N1 strains across the globe linking animal and human outbreaks (see Wang et al. 2008; Cattoli et al. 2009 ).

The level of accuracy to detect single nucleotide change in parasite genomes of these molecular tools is increasing and their use at the ecosystem level can pick-up recent transmission events including their direction.

The evolution of parasites is often faster than the evolution of their hosts (Nieberding and Olivieri 2007) . Recent host population dynamics not detected in the host genetic material can be captured by the faster genetic evolution of its parasites. Applied to our context, a phylogenetic tree of the same parasites detected in different host populations in the same ecosystem can reveal connexions between these host populations and give an estimate of the EIs between these host populations for this specific pathogen. The molecular tools can be used to characterise EIs.

The epidemiology of each disease is different and one cannot draw inferences on a pathogen using data from another. However, from an ecological perspective, the line of thoughts is logical even if challenging. There is not an infinite opportunities for a pathogen to be transmitted between two host populations and new pathogens will use routes already used by other pathogens with a higher probability. Identifying common pathways between host populations will therefore increase the knowledge about future probable emergence pathways in this system. This pathogen approach does not refer to a specific pathogen and focuses on the hosts' direct and indirect contacts but only the ones resulting in pathogen transmission. The utility of such an approach is obvious in the surveillance of EIDs in a hotspot: with an EI network, one can assess the probability of future spill-over processes between specific populations and target surveillance and/or control. In a limited-resource environment (true everywhere but even more in most EID hotspots), EI networks will point at most probable transmission pathways between host populations which can be acted upon to reduce the probability of transmission/emergence. Box 14.1 gives an example of an EI network built using presence-absence data of macro-and micro-parasites in 14 rodent species and the human species. The data has been gathered from the literature (see Chaisiri et al. 2010) .

This step can be done by creating a sub-network with the selected pathogens or by weighting the influence of some pathogens in the network.

The design of a research framework focusing on emerging RNA viruses will select pathogens with similar mode of transmission (other RNA viruses for example) which should use the same EIs.
