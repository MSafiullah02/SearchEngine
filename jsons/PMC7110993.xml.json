The genomic regions codifying for the spike glycoprotein were identified from these sequences by using ORFfinder search [11]. The corresponding aminoacid sequences were aligned and, with the use of ClustalW v. 1.7 [12], 99\u2013100% pairwise sequence identities were obtained. Then, a consensus sequence obtained from this alignment was used to find a subset of homologous S glycoprotein sequences of other coronaviruses using Psi-Blast v. 2.1 [11]. Some of these sequences were chosen for secondary structure prediction and fold recognition studies, using PsiPred v.2.1 [13] and GenTHREADER [14], respectively. With the fold recognition method the S glycoprotein of Human Coronavirus (SwissProt Accession No. SP_36334) [15] identifies the 1G9D pdb entry [16], while the S protein of Canine Coronavirus (SwissProt Accession No. SP_36300) [15] identifies the 1G5G pdb entry [16]. For each hit to a particular PDB entry, a SCOP v. 1.63 [17] classification of names and numbers was made. Model building of S1 and S2 subunits of SARS S glycoprotein was carried out with the ClustalW [12] alignment between the target sequence and that of the template structure. Models were subsequently optimised according to secondary structure predictions. Substitution of aminoacid residues and modelling of insertions and deletions in the target structure were performed using SwissPDBViewer software [18]. The 3D models were optimised by a 900 step minimisation run with AMBER [19] and finally validated with the PROCHECK v. 3.5.4 procedure [20]. Surface accessibility of the potential glycosylation site, mutation distribution, and localisation of CD13 binding regions were analysed by using MOLMOL software [21]. With the same software possible disulphide bridge formations were investigated by considering a threshold distance of 10 \u00c5 between C\u03b1 atoms of cysteine couples, after the prediction of the bonding/non-bonding state of all the cysteine present in S1 and S2 sequences [22]. The hydropathy profile of the protein was calculated according to Kyte and Doolittle plots [23] and hydrophilic/hydrophobic potentials were calculated with GRID [24], using a grid resolution of 1 \u00c5 and the standard \u201cOH2\u201d and \u201cDRY\u201d probes.",

In fact, a preliminary sequence alignment of various coronavirus S glycoproteins was performed and a fold recognition analysis was done on the aligned sequences. Among all the aligned S glycoprotein sequences, one of human coronavirus (SwissProt Accession Number SP36334) and one of canine coronavirus (SwissProt Accession Number SP36300) were chosen for fold recognition studies using GenTHREADER v2.1 [14]. The GenTHREADER results for human and canine CoV S proteins indicated two pdb entries, i.e., 1G9D of neurotoxin B of Clostridium botulinum and 1G5G of the Tetanus toxin, as possible templates for structure predictions. After sequence alignment of SARS S protein (SwissProt Accession Number P59594) with the corresponding ones from human and canine coronaviruses, model building of S1 and S2 subunits was obtained by using the latter two pdb files and shuffled PsiPred runs [13], with subsequent manual optimisation to enhance the overlapping between the predicted and observed secondary structure elements.",
