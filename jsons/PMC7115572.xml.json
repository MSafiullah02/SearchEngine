            "text": "Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) was first isolated in September 2012 from a patient in Saudi Arabia who presented two months earlier with severe acute respiratory infection and acute renal failure [1]. Retrospective testing of samples in Jordan identified earlier cases from a nosocomial outbreak in April 2012 [2]. Although the majority of MERS-CoV cases (\u223c75%) have occurred in Saudi Arabia, 25 other countries have confirmed imported or autochthonously transmitted cases (Fig. 1\n) [3], [4]. The most recent and largest outbreak outside of Saudi Arabia occurred in South Korea in May 2015 [5], raising concern for an eruption of regional outbreaks or accelerated global spread, similar to the phylogenetically related severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that killed nearly a thousand people a decade earlier [6]. Although the definitive host for MERS-CoV has not yet been established, closely related coronaviruses have been isolated from bats across wide geographic areas [7], [8], [9]. Mounting evidence has strongly implicated dromedary camels as the intermediate animal reservoir, as serological surveys throughout the Middle East and North Africa have demonstrated them to have a high prevalence of MERS-CoV binding or neutralizing Abs [10], [11], [12], [13]. Additionally, outbreak investigations have suggested epidemiologic linkage between farm camels and human cases [14].",

Its genome contains a replicase locus at the 5\u2032 end and codes for structural proteins toward the 3\u2032 end. The most immunogenic of the viral proteins is Spike (S), a trimeric, envelope-anchored, type I fusion glycoprotein that interfaces with its human host cognate receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), to mediate viral entry [16], [17]. S comprises two subunits: S1, which contains the receptor-binding domain and determines cell tropism; and S2, the location of the cell fusion machinery. Although DPP4 has a broad tissue distribution, most of the clinical manifestations of MERS-CoV can be attributed to its localization to the lower respiratory tract [18], [19]. Much like other coronaviruses, MERS-CoV can also cause significant dysfunction of the gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, renal, and neurologic systems. MERS-CoV is distinct, though, in its tendency to cause greatest harm to older individuals with concurrent comorbidities of one or more of these organ-systems [20], [21].",

Although combination treatment with ribavirin and interferons were shown to improve clinical outcomes in MERS-CoV-infected non-human primates (NHPs), treatment was initiated very soon after viral challenge (\u223c8 h) and results have not been replicated in humans [22]. In fact, no experimental interventions have demonstrated appreciable benefit in acutely ill patients in a consistent or controlled manner. Rapidly scaled treatments based on naturally occurring neutralizing antibodies such as convalescent plasma or hyperimmune globulin, on the other hand, have demonstrated mortality reductions for other respiratory infections and may hold promise for MERS-CoV as well [23]. Their development, however, is limited by logistical challenges, local technical capacity, and donor supply. Supportive management, adapted from guidelines developed for SARS-CoV, has thus far been the mainstay of MERS-CoV treatment.",

Previous approaches to coronavirus vaccine development were broad and included whole-inactivated and live-attenuated viruses, recombinant vectors and protein subunits, as well as DNA and RNA based platforms [6]. Most developers based their immunogen designs on the S surface glycoprotein, the primary target for neutralizing antibodies during any natural coronavirus infection. A number of preclinical and clinical studies showed that the SARS-CoV S1 protein subunit, and specifically the RBD at its core, could serve as a dominant target for neutralizing antibodies in mice, non-human primates, and humans [24]. S1, therefore, became the basis for a number of promising SARS-CoV vaccine candidates.",

Resolution of RBD crystal structures alone or in complex with the DPP4 receptor [25], [30], [31] have informed the design of immunogens that have been expressed either as recombinant protein fragments or conjugates to the fragment crystallizable (Fc) region of human antibodies. Both types of constructs, in formulation with aluminum salt or oil-in-water adjuvants, have elicited neutralizing antibodies of high potency across multiple viral strains. Despite their demonstrated immunogenicity in animal models and anticipated safety in humans, RBD or S1-subunit based vaccine candidates are limited in their epitope breadth. Although the coronavirus genomes are not as variable as other RNA viruses, the RBD is the most mutable region, containing mutation sites that define antibody escape variants [25], [32]. Thus, vaccine candidates that elicit a more diverse antibody repertoire as well as a robust cellular immune response may offer the advantage of broader and more durable protection.",

Investigators at the University of Maryland, in collaboration with Novavax, Inc., have overcome this problem through the development of S rosettes that are stable and immunogenic in murine models [33]. Vaccines that mimic natural infection, such as live-attenuated viruses or recombinant viral vectors, may elicit even more robust immunity. Live attenuated viruses have historically been among the most immunogenic platforms available, as they have the capacity to present multiple antigens across the viral life cycle in their native conformations. Although a live-attenuated MERS-CoV has yet to be tested, one has been constructed and has the potential to be protective [34]. However, manufacturing live-attenuated viruses requires containment in a biosafety level 3 or 4 facility. Additionally, live-attenuated viruses carry the hazards of inadequate attenuation or reversion to wild type form and causing disseminated disease, particularly in immunocompromised hosts. Given that moderately immunocompromised adults with co-morbidities such as diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease have suffered the most severe MERS-CoV disease, these individuals may comprise a target population for immunization, thus making a live-attenuated virus vaccine a less viable option. Replication competent viral vectors could pose a similar threat for disseminated disease in the immunosuppressed. Replication deficient vectors, however, avoid that risk while maintaining the advantages of native antigen presentation, elicitation of T cell immunity and the ability to express multiple antigens. To date, two recombinant vector platforms\u2014modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) and adenovirus vectors\u2014have been used to express MERS-CoV S glycoprotein. Both viral vectors have been immunogenic and one of the MVA candidates was protective in a mouse model transduced with human DPP4 [35], [36], [37], [38].",

One way to overcome this limitation is by administering different vectors in a so-called prime-boost immunization regimen. As this strategy has been effective for other pathogens, it is likely that the same success could be recapitulated for MERS-CoV. The use of more than one type of platform or antigen in a single vaccine also increases the likelihood of inducing a broad repertoire of antibodies with diverse mechanisms of viral neutralization. One vaccine regimen developed at the US National Institutes of Health is based on full-length S DNA and a truncated S1 subunit glycoprotein and has elicited neutralizing antibodies in mice directed at both the S1\u2014within and outside the RBD\u2014and S2 subunits. Immunization with these constructs also protected NHPs from severe lung disease after intra-tracheal challenge with MERS-CoV [25]. A DNA-only vaccine, expressing multiple antigens, has also been developed by Inovio Pharmaceuticals and GeneOne Life Science Inc. and has been advanced to a Phase I first-in-human trial.",

Also, with such low incidence and lack of robust animal models, it would be difficult to achieve a vaccine efficacy result that would be sufficient to support licensure. Human mAbs, on the other hand, could be used without as much discrimination in an outbreak setting for post-exposure prophylaxis and early treatment. The advantages of mAbs over polyclonal antibodies (administered through convalescent plasma or hyperimmune globulin) are their higher potency, greater specificity, more extensive pre-licensing evaluation and consequently improved safety profile. Additionally, mAbs can help define immunogenic epitopes through crystallographic analysis, thereby providing atomic level detail for the design of better immunogens. However, the timeline for mAb development may be longer and potentially cost more than some vaccines.",

Almost all of the mAbs that have been reported target the Spike RBD. It is likely that mAbs directed at other sites on the Spike glycoprotein have been recovered but are not as potent neutralizers. Most of those that have been published bind to recombinant Spike with picomolar affinity and neutralize MERS-CoV pseudovirus at a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.1 mcg/\u03bcl or less. Additionally, some have demonstrated protective efficacy in pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis animal models [44], [45].

Given the broad distribution and ownership of camels in the Arabian Peninsula where most cases have occurred, a targeted vaccine campaign may prove difficult.

Although Hendra virus is even more rare than MERS-CoV, it is highly fatal with no treatment other than intensive supportive management. In 2012, a protein subunit vaccine was licensed and rolled-out in Australia, where all outbreaks of the virus occurred. Since that time, the incidence in horses has fallen precipitously and no human cases have been detected [53]. A similar strategy may be applicable to MERS-CoV; however, a veterinary vaccination in this context would be deployed solely for the sake of protecting humans, as the virus causes only mild upper respiratory illness in camels. Safety and reduction in viral shedding would have to be demonstrated in immunization, challenge and transmission studies of camel or camelid populations, one of which has shown efficacy [54].",

Although more relevant than a standard murine model, transient transduction of the desired protein may result in inconsistent tissue expression of adenovirus antigens. Agrawal et al. made an important advance with the development of a transgenic mouse model that demonstrated productive, disseminated MERS-CoV infection [56]. Although rhesus macaques do not manifest full clinical disease, they develop a transient lower respiratory infection that can be quantified and evaluated by computed tomography. Investigators at the NIH Rocky Mountain Laboratories (RML) and Integrated Research Facility (IRF) have also independently been developing potentially lethal marmoset models that could be used for the evaluation of vaccines, mAbs and therapeutics [57].",

The World Health Organization is currently developing a blueprint by which that preparation and response can follow, with MERS-CoV highlighted as a case study. Although MERS-CoV still causes relatively few cases in a limited geographic distribution, its high case fatality and sudden outbreak in in Korea have proven it to be a pathogen of public health concern.
