Although some investigators believe that NME lesions resemble those associated with forms of viral encephalitis in other species, 1 viral involvement has yet to be demonstrated. A study of paraffin-embedded brain tissue using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from 12 dogs with necrotizing encephalitis failed to yield DNA from herpes-, adeno-, or parvovirus. 15 Several investigators have speculated that NME is either a primary autoimmune disease or secondary autoimmune event that occurs in response to antigen exposure. 2, [15] [16] [17] Autoantibodies directed against astrocytes and glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) have been identified in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum of affected dogs, which may support these hypotheses. [17] [18] [19] [20] Mx proteins, which are interferon-induced GTPases associated with viral and inflammatory disease, also have been demonstrated in brain tissue from Pugs with NME. 21 Recently, a multifactorial etiopathogenesis has been advocated, with environmental influences and genetic background both hypothesized to contribute to the development of NME. 2, 15, 16 Limited data are available concerning the age, sex, and geographic background of Pugs with NME. To the authors' knowledge, information concerning treatment and survival largely has been based on small case series or clinical anecdotes.

This observation may suggest that age does not discriminate NME from other intracranial diseases in Pugs. However, the non-NME control Pugs may not be representative of Pugs with all intracranial disorders because of the method in which cases were collected or because the sample size may have been too small to identify a significant difference between groups. The age of Pugs with NME, for instance, appears to be younger than that which typically is reported for granulomatous meningoencephalitis (GME), another common noninfectious inflammatory disease of the CNS. In a study of 42 cases of histopathologically confirmed GME, the mean age of affected dogs was 55 months (range, 6-144 months). 27 Age ranges from 3 smaller studies on GME were o1 year-13 years, 28 4-10 years, 29 and 3-8 years. 30 Pugs with NME more frequently were female (40/60) than were controls (6/14), but this difference was not significant (P 5 .10). The proportion of females in the NME group, however, was significantly higher than a null assumption of a 50:50 male to female population (P 5 .01). The high proportion of females in the NME group is interesting, because autoimmune encephalopathies seem to be more common in females across several species. Several studies have shown that females are affected more commonly with GME than are males, with 1 large report indicating that 68% of cases were intact or spayed female dogs. 23, 27 Females also are predisposed to developing multiple sclerosis (MS) and experimental allergic encephalitis (EAE), which are autoimmune demyelinating diseases of humans and rodents, respectively. [31] [32] [33] The mechanisms for female overrepresentation in EAE and MS are unclear, but may relate to sex steroid-associated alterations in T-helper 1 cytokines, suppression of T-regulatory cells, X-chromosome susceptibility alleles, or other factors. [31] [32] [33] Interestingly, local dysregulation of T-cell behavior also is believed to be important in the development of GME. 34 Although the lesion distribution and histopathology of NME are distinct from GME, MS, and EAE, the similar sex bias associated with all 4 diseases may indicate a degree of overlap in etiopathogenesis.

Low body weight in Pugs with NME, like the high proportion of females in this group, may support underlying immune dysregulation because cytokines associated with various autoimmune diseases can result in loss of lean muscle mass and cachexia. 35, 36 Alternatively, intracranial lesion burden may differ between Pugs with NME versus controls, leading to a direct effect on dietary intake. Injuries to the diencephalon, for example, have been shown to impact appetite. 37 The seasonal onset and geographic distribution of NME have not been investigated previously. Although both seasonal and geographic information is available for some forms of infectious encephalitis in dogs, such as rabies, to the authors' knowledge, these data have not been obtained for other idiopathic inflammatory CNS diseases such as steroid-responsive meningitis (SRMA), GME, and various tremor syndromes. 38 Although there was no significant difference in the proportion of dogs with onset of NME during each season or the average outdoor temperature at onset between NME dogs and controls, the population investigated in this study was relatively small. Immune-mediated encephalitides in other species may have a seasonal bias in onset. In MS, for example, exacerbations are common during certain seasons because of weather-associated alterations in immunocompetence or monthly variations in exposure to viruses that may trigger immune-mediated inflammation. 39, 40 Geographic location also was evaluated for its potential to contribute to the development of NME. Pugs with NME most commonly were from the western (n 5 17), southeastern (11) , and midwestern (11) regions, with the fewest dogs originating from the mid-Atlantic (4), northeastern (4), and southwestern (4) regions. When geographic case distribution was dichotomized into the eastern and western United States and above and below 401 latitude, no significant differences between groups were identified. Although the lack of geographic influence in case distribution may be genuine, the small number of NME cases in this report and the means of case recruitment necessitate cautious interpretation of results. The incidence of immune-mediated encephalopathies in other species, including MS, may vary based on the geographic latitudes where patients live. 41 Although a high proportion of Pugs with NME resided in urbanized areas (72%), this was not significantly different than the proportion of control dogs from urbanized zones (60%). The high proportion of both cases and controls that resided in urbanized areas may simply be reflective of the number of Pugs in these regions, differences in client values between rural and urbanized areas, or a difference in environmental factors that influence the development of intracranial disease in general.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 326, "end": 329, "text": "35,", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1520, "end": 1523, "text": "39,", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Vaccination status was examined in NME and non-NME groups, because antigen exposure has been speculated to play a role in the development of various encephalitides, including NME. 1, 2, 16 The proportion of dogs vaccinated within 1 month of disease onset and the duration between vaccination and onset were not significantly different between groups. Furthermore, only a small proportion of NME dogs (0.11) were vaccinated within 1 month of onset. Pugs with NME and a history of parvovirus vaccination had a higher death rate (hazard ratio 5 2.35; Table 4 ), but this result was not significant (P 5 .053). If parvovirus vaccination is involved in the pathogenesis of NME, mechanisms are most likely immune mediated because dogs in this report had no identifiable parvovirus in brain tissue as assessed by PCR. In humans, vaccination has been associated with various immune-mediated encephalopathies. [42] [43] [44] Measles virus vaccine, for example, has been speculated to predispose individuals to MS, whereas mumps vaccine has been associated with a form of postvaccinal aseptic meningitis. 42, 43 Despite these associations, the risk of autoimmune encephalitis after vaccination is believed to be exceedingly low in humans, in some cases on the order of 1 case per 1,000,000 vaccinations. 42 The lack of clear association between vaccination and NME in this report is therefore not unexpected, especially considering the small sample size.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 180, "end": 182, "text": "1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 183, "end": 185, "text": "2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 901, "end": 905, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 906, "end": 910, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 911, "end": 915, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1095, "end": 1098, "text": "42,", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 548, "end": 555, "text": "Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Data from CSF analysis were available from 14/60 Pugs with NME. The mean CSF WBC cell count was 120 cells/mL (range, 0-540), with 12/14 dogs having CSF pleocytosis. Most dogs (8/14) had lymphocytic pleocytosis, with the remainder having mixed cell or large mononuclear pleocytosis. These data are similar to what has been described in 12 Pugs with NME, where pleocytosis was detected in all dogs (mean, 374 cells/mL; range, 71-630) and inflammation was predominantly lymphocytic. 1 The CSF results in this report also resembled what has been reported in Yorkshire Terriers and Maltese with NME. In 5 Yorkshire Terriers with NME, pleocytosis was detected in 4 dogs (range, 12-76 cells/mL) and characterized as lymphocytic or large mononuclear. 11 In a population of 3 Maltese dogs with NME, CSF WBC counts ranged from 50 to 247 cells/mL. Results of CSF analysis from other causes of noninfectious meningoencephalomyelitis in dogs, such as GME and SRMA, may be somewhat different than NME in Pugs. In 1 report, mean cisternal CSF WBC count from 17 dogs with GME was 800 cells/mL (range, 9-5,400); most dogs had lymphocytic or large mononuclear pleocytosis. 30 In another study, 16/16 dogs with GME had pleocytosis, with 8 having WBC counts ranging from 15 to 80 cells/mL, 5 having WBC counts ranging from 81 to 1,000 cells/mL, and 3 having WBC counts 41,000 cells/ mL. 45 Dogs with SRMA typically have neutrophilic pleocytosis, with many animals having 41,000 cells/ mL. 45 Although CSF results cannot definitively distinguish NME from other disorders, marked pleocytosis and a high proportion of neutrophils are not characteristic. The lack of marked CSF pleocytosis in some Pugs with NME and absence of CSF pleocytosis in 2/14 Pugs with NME are interesting, especially considering data that suggest relatively consistent involvement of the leptomeninges. 1, 3 The mean survival for Pugs with NME was 93 days (range, 1-680 days), with dogs that received any form of treatment having significantly longer mean survival times (101 days) than those that received no treatment (7.4 days) . Because only Pugs with necropsy-confirmed NME were included in our analysis, survival data may be biased toward Pugs with more severe disease and therefore falsely shortened. When treatments were divided into antimicrobials, ACDs, corticosteroids, and immunosuppressive drugs, only the administration of an ACD was significantly associated with prolonged survival. The administration of ACDs may be directly neuroprotective and enhance owner perceptions of quality of life. Prolonged seizure activity induces neuronal apoptosis via the activation of both extrinsic (eg, cell-surface receptors) and intrinsic (eg, organelle) triggers. 46 Seizures also may damage neurons through glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity and the induction of proinflammatory cytokines. 47, 48 Although providing ACDs may help prevent development of these lesions, decreasing seizure frequency also will improve perceived quality of life and hence survival. In a recent report on idiopathic epilepsy, inadequate seizure control was recognized as a reason for decreased quality of life in 5/12 dogs. 49 The inclusion of dogs that did not receive treatments in comparison groups may have skewed results toward certain treatments having a favorable effect on survival. If dogs were not treated because euthanasia was deemed most appropriate, then short survival in this group may have confounded the comparison because untreated dogs had a worse prognosis (ie, confounding by indication to treat).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1855, "end": 1857, "text": "1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 2072, "end": 2082, "text": "(7.4 days)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2845, "end": 2848, "text": "47,", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Given the relatively small number of dogs receiving treatments (n 5 46) and the method of data acquisition, the lack of effect of certain interventions must be interpreted cautiously.
