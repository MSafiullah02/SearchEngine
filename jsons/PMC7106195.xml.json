Most of the currently available antibodies are produced in mammals, especially in small rodents [1]. However, the production of antibodies in mammals can be challenging due to the fact that some antigens elicit weak immune responses or are even completely non-immunogenic. Moreover, the production of antibodies in mammals involves procedures that cause pain and distress to animals; such as immunization, blood sample collection and sacrifice [2]. The search for more efficient and economical techniques, as well as for the reduction and refinement of the use of animals, has led to growing interest for egg yolk antibodies (IgY). Obtaining antibodies from egg yolk is a non-invasive method that eliminates the need for blood collection.",

This method presents several economical advantages over the use of other animals. For example, the cost of maintaining a hen is less expensive than maintaining animals like mice and rabbits; the amount of antibodies produced by chickens also corresponds to that of larger animals, such as goats and sheep. For instance, in one year, a hen lays about 300 eggs and produces an average of 18, 25 g of IgY [4]. Moreover, the specific IgY produced in chickens are about 1\u201310% of the total amount of antibodies [1]. Nonetheless, the amount of antibodies produced is correlated to the quantity of antigen applied to the hen, its immunogenicity and molecular weight [5,6]. Being a productive technique, as well as more refined from the point of view of animal welfare, IgY technology has been used for several purposes in human and veterinary health, such as in immunodiagnostics [7], immunotherapy [8], neutralization of toxins from venomous animals [9] and bacteria [10], and as functional food [11].",

However, this knowledge remained without applications until it attracted the interest of the scientific community due to the search for animal welfare, which was driven by the works of Russel & Burch and the publication of the \u201cPrinciples of Humane Experimental Technique\u201d in 1959. The use of IgY increased in the 80s, possibly due to the development of commercially available secondary reagents, such as IgY purification kits and anti-IgY specific antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase, fluorescein isothiocyanate and peroxidase markers [13]. In 1996, the European Center for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM) workshop recommended the use of IgY rather than mammalian IgG, with the purpose of minimizing the pain generated by invasive collection of serum antibodies [3].",

IgG has three constant regions at the heavy chains (CH1-CH3), while IgY has four constant regions (CH1-CH4) (Fig. 1\n).

            "text": "IgY is less flexible than IgG due to the absence of the hinge region between CH1 and CH2 [1], similar, in this aspect, to IgE [16,17]. The presence of glycine and proline residues at CH1-CH2 and CH2-CH3 regions also limits IgY flexibility [1]. One advantage of this higher chain stiffness is that it may be associated with increased IgY resistance to proteolytic degradation and fragmentation [17]. Also, IgY is more hydrophobic than IgG and has an isoelectric point between 5.7 and 7.6. The half-life of purified IgY is of months, retaining activity for up to six months at room temperature and one month at 37 \u00b0C. Moreover, affinity-purified and 21 biotinylated IgY retained high activity after five years of storage at 4 \u00b0C [1]. The structural and phylogenetic differences between IgY and IgG are manifested in different molecular and biochemical interactions. The Fc portion of IgY is unable to activate the human complement [18] and to bind to rheumatoid factor [19] and to protein G [20], it also does not react with human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) [21] nor with the erythrocyte agglutinogens A and B [22]. Due to phylogenetic distance, chickens produce a stronger immune response against conserved mammalian proteins [23]. Although IgY contains the variable (V), junction (J) and diversity (D) regions, the contribution of the V (D) J rearrangement to its immunogenetic diversity is small, due to the fact that only a single locus undergoes rearrangement [24]. Thus, the genetic diversity of IgY is guaranteed by gene hyperconversion, a process in which pseudogenes donate homologous sequences to the functional gene (V) after V (D) J rearrangement [25].",

However, the affinity of IgY to its antigen decreases with increasing temperature. Nonetheless, the addition of sucrose, maltose and glycine protects IgY from heat denaturation [8], while sorbitol stabilizes it at acid pH [26]. IgY is resistant to inactivation by the proteolytic enzymes trypsin and chymotrypsin, but is degraded by pepsin [27]. The digestion of IgY with papain leads to a Fc fragment plus two monovalent Fab fragments, like IgG. Nonetheless, IgY digestion with pepsin leads to a pFc\u2032 fragment and two monovalent Fab fragments, unlike mammalian antibodies, which forms one bivalent Fab fragment when cleaved by pepsin [28]. The characteristics of IgY, in comparison to IgG, are summarized in Table 1\n.",

Although some studies have shown that the immunization with FCA is more tolerated by birds than by mammals and seems to not generate tissue damage in chickens [23,41], other studies using FCA for bird immunization contradict these results [42,43]. Since there is no consensus, one of the best substitutes for FCA is Freund's Incomplete Adjuvant (FIA), which, unlike FCA, does not contain mycobacteria. Shade et al. recommended the use of FIA, which can be used since the first immunization without any prejudice to the antibody titer [3]. In spite of this, the first inoculation is generally performed using FCA, while the subsequent inoculations are performed using FIA, without the occurrence of inflammation at the injection site [44,45].",

This technique is most suited for young hens, because subcutaneous injection into the neck is more difficult to perform and may cause more distress to the animal. The intramuscular injection into the leg must be avoided as it can lead to lameness [3]. Nonetheless, for a non-invasive method, the administration of antigen can also be performed orally [46]. The number of inoculations required depends on the type and dose of the antigen, as well as the adjuvant used. At least two inoculations must be performed before the laying period, with an interval of four to six weeks. The titer of IgY must be assessed 14 days after the last immunization. If the antibody titer decreases, further immunizations must be done during the entire laying period to increase antibody titers year round [3]. An increase in titer of egg yolk antibodies can be observed from the second week [47,48] or sometimes from the fifth week post antigen inoculation [49]. After a steady increase, stabilization of the antibody titer occurs, reaching a plateau, and from there on it decreases progressively [48]. Through booster inoculations, it is possible to keep high titers of egg yolk antibodies for more than 150 days [50].",

The method consists on the delipidation by centrifuging egg yolk diluted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with 3.5% of PEG 6000. Next, the supernatant is twice centrifuged with 12% of PEG 6000 to precipitate the antibodies [6]. Akita & Nakai obtained highly purified IgY by removing the lipids from the yolks by means of six-fold dilution in water at pH 5.0, with an incubation time of 6 h at 4 \u00b0C, followed by IgY precipitation with 60% of ammonium sulfate (NH4)2SO4, which was supplemented by the addition of sodium chloride (NaCl) or by ultrafiltration prior to gel filtration or ion exchange chromatography. The authors also achieved highly purified IgY by means of ethanol precipitation at lower temperatures [51]. Nonetheless, a study conducted by Ara\u00fajo et al. showed that the most suited concentration of (NH4)2SO4 for IgY's precipitation is 20%. In this study, higher concentrations of (NH4)2SO4 also caused the precipitation of non-specific proteins, while a lower concentration led to a greater loss of antibodies in the supernatant [52].",

Such a feature may be advantageous to produce IgY against human tumor antigens. Following this rationale, Amirijavidv et al. produced highly specific IgY against a sequence of 21 amino acids present on the ectodomain of the TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) receptor TRAIL-R2 (DR5). The antibodies bound to the amino acid sequence and activated the DR5 receptors in human breast cancer cells MCF7, acting as a TRAIL agonist and inducing apoptosis [87]. IgY against other receptors, such as the HER2 receptor, was tested coupled to single walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and specifically detected the HER2 receptors on the surface of SK-BR-3 cells. The binding of the complex to the receptors was measured by Raman signals emitted by the nanotubes. SWNT has a near infrared absorption (NIR), which can be used for tumor ablation, and, coupled to anti-HER2 IgY, was able to kill SK-BR-3 cells without needing internalization of the complex by the cell [88]. These findings show that IgY produced against tumor antigens is an attractive alternative for a more selective treatment of cancers and its use could, therefore, minimize the side effects of traditional chemotherapy.",

One advantage of using IgY in anti-venom serotherapy is that it is easily purified, which would minimize the occurrence of side effects due to non-specific proteins. Araujo et al. demonstrated this property when specific IgY was produced as anti-venom of the snake genus Bothrops sp. These antibodies neutralized a pool of venoms from five Bothrops species, with an ED50 of 150 \u03bcL/2LD50, showing little to no side effects in mice [52].",
