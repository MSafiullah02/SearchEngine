While a single session of physical exercise may induce a transient imbalance of cell homeostasis, repeated physical exercise sessions will improve immunosurveillance and immunocompetence. Additionally, immune cells from the central nervous system will acquire an anti-inflammatory phenotype, protecting central functions from age-induced cognitive decline. This review highlights the exercise-induced anti-inflammatory effect on the prevention or treatment of common chronic clinical and experimental settings. It also suggests the use of pterins in biological fluids as sensitive biomarkers to follow the anti-inflammatory effect of physical exercise. Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Although acute inflammation is a transient inflammatory response and is beneficial to the organism, a persitent inflammatory response is associated with tissue dysfunction and pathology [9]. Examples of chronic non-communicable diseases with inflammation as a physiopathological key component are obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), atherosclerosis, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, asthma, dementia and neurodegenerative diseases [6,10-16]. COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is a communicable disease responsible for the ongoing global pandemic [17]. Recent evidence has demonstrated that COVID-19 impairs the immune system response by inducing leukopenia with increased levels of pro-inflammatory mediators. Furthermore, this immune dysregulation might have a fatal outcome mainly in individuals with preexisting medical conditions and in elderly patients in whom a chronic inflammation status is expected [18,19]. In this scenario, it has been shown that physical exercise Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f improves overall health and reduces all-cause mortality risk (for a revision see ref.",

In general repeated moderate intensity exercise enhances the immune function response, reinforces the antioxidative capacity, reduces oxidative stress, and increases the efficiency of energy generation, therefore reducing the incidence of inflammatory diseases [6, 7] . Acute bouts of physical exercise also regulate the immune response, i.e. by transiently redistributing immune cells to peripheral tissues, resulting in a heightened state of immunocompetence [8] .",

            "text": "The practice of physical exercise can elicit acute or chronic biochemical and physiological responses based on the exercise frequency, volume and intensity ( Figure 1 ). Acute physiological responses are associated, for example, with the immediate effects of a single bout of exercise, which induce alterations in the homeostasis of the whole body, e.g., increase in the heart rate, transient tissue redistribution of immune cells [30] [31] [32] . Physical activity and physical exercise can be both acute and chronic. When a single bout of exercise (acute physical exercise) is repeated over time it becomes a chronic exercise, which can also be defined as exercise training [30, 33] . The intensity of exercise determines the overall physiological responses to exercise training (see the classification of physical exercise intensities in Table 2 ), and it is typically expressed as a percentage of the maximum oxygen uptake (VO 2max ) of the individual. [1, 28] . VO 2max represents the maximum aerobic capacity and high energy use during exercise, and it is defined as the combined capacities of the pulmonary and cardiovascular systems to deliver oxygen to skeletal muscles, and the ability of those muscles to utilize it [28] . J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Many literature reports show that the regular practice of physical exercise can be considered as a tool to prevent and / or to treat numerous clinical conditions, e.g., high blood pressure, cardiovascular risk, insulin resistance and body mass percentage [12, 21, 22, 35] . However, if exceeded the minimum recommended amounts of physical activity, more significant improvements could be obtained in terms of quality and physical fitness [1] . On the other hand, physical exercise below a minimum intensity, will not cause changes in body homeostasis, and therefore will not stimulate biochemical and physiological adaptations favoring a healthier lifestyle [1] . Indeed, a sedentary behavior increases, for example, the risk of dementia and the development of cognitive impairment [36] . On the other hand, vigorous intensity physical exercise is J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f usually associated to adverse cardiovascular events such as sudden cardiac death or acute myocardial infarction [1, 2] . Therefore, there is a dose-response relationship between physical exercise and health outcomes ( Figure 2 ). It implies that the practice of physical exercise, a free-drug treatment, takes into account the health or fitness outcome that the individual craves.",

Lymphocytes are the main cells involved in acquired immunity, and are responsible for secreting antibodies and cytokines, including IFN-\uf067 and TNF-\u03b1 [43, 49] . During vigorous aerobic exercise is observed that peripheral blood lymphocyte is increased, suggesting an exercise-induced immune system activation [8] . However, 1-2h post-exercise a decreased in the peripheral blood lymphocyte is observed, representing to the athlete a period of risk to contract infections and reinforcing the hypothesis that exercise promote a short-term window of immune suppression [32] . On the other hand, the lymphopenia described as a resulting of performing vigorous-intensity exercise might represent a heightened state of immunosurveillance and competence driven by a preferential mobilization of cells to more susceptible areas to infection after physical exercise (e.g., lungs and gut) [8] .",

            "text": "The regular practice of moderate-intensity of exercise has been extensively recommended to counteract sustained low-grade chronic inflammation in the periphery and also in the brain [6, 26] . Many experimental studies using mouse models have shown that physical exercise decreased hippocampal proliferation of microglia (macrophage-like immune cells of the CNS) [26, 50, 51] , hippocampal expression of immune-related genes [52] , nuclear NF-\u03baB activation [52] , and the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-\u03b1 [53] , IFN-\uf067 [26] and IL-1\u03b2 [54] . The antiinflammation induced by chronic physical exercise has been demonstrated to involve a J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f differential cytokine response represented by increased circulating IL-6 levels followed by a rise in IL-1ra and IL-10 levels and a suppression of TNF production [26, 55] . The sustained modulation on the circulating levels of cytokines may influence the brain function, from behavior to several other vital functions [56] . For example, chronic exercise promotes the production IL-4 to enhance hippocampal-regulated learning and cognition by stimulating the synthesis of the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) [56] , to induce microglia to release BDNF, insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) and transforming growth factor \uf062 (TGF-\uf062), for enhancing neuronal functioning [56] . An anti-inflammatory status has also shown to increase the activity of specific transcription factors, i.e., REST (RE1-silencing transcription factor; otherwise called neuron-restrictive silence factor). REST, currently described as a facilitator of cognition, was demonstrated to be inactivated in individuals affected by cognitive disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and increased in the hippocampus of agedmice submitted to a protocol of physical activity [57] .",

However, it has been shown that IL-6 and IL-6-induced acute phase proteins have anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects when they come from skeletal muscle (myokine function), decreasing the pro-inflammatory response of the immune system [65] . This differential effect of IL-6 has been shown to be induced by physical exercise (Figure 3 ). Muscle IL-6 production is controlled by Ca +2 and glycogen/p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) stimuli, known to be associated to muscle contraction [66] . Usually, plasma IL-6 peak occurs as soon as the physical exercise ends, returning to basal levels in a few hours after recovery [67, 68] . Modest increases of IL-6 are expected after exercise of low to moderate intensity or in intermittent physical exercise protocols of a shorter duration [68] . Under long-term physical exercise (over 2.5 hours; e.g. marathon runners) muscle and blood IL-6 levels increase up to 100-fold, which is accompanied by raised levels of anti-inflammatory and cytokine inhibitors J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f such as IL-1r\uf061 and IL-10 levels [26, 55, 68] . The release of these mediators by blood mononuclear cells may possibly represent a mechanisms to control exacerbated inflammation, especially in elite athlete [38, 69, 70] .",

Microglial cells may support neuronal function due to the capacity to secrete anti-inflammatory mediators, facilitate phagocytosis and cell repair when required, and to scavenge ROS. Microglia is the primary immune cell in the CNS and under stress adopts a pro-inflammatory phenotype releasing, e.g., TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\uf062 [127] . In line, treadmill exercise protocol with low to moderate intensity decrease the hypothalamic microglial activation in an animal model of obesity induced by high-fat diet [128] . In addition, similar training protocol improved motor behavior and microglial activation by reducing the NOS II (nitric oxide synthase II) expression, involved in microglial oxidative burst [129] . Microglia activation has been related with reduction of dopaminergic neurotransmission in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), contributing to the physiopathology of Parkinson's disease [130] . Other CNS alterations has shown altered monoaminergic metabolism, like the down-regulation of the biosynthesis of serotonin, which is implicated in the physiopathology of depression [133] . In addition, increased blood levels of proinflammatory mediators, e.g., IL-8 and TNF-\uf061, with low levels of BDNF have been documented in individuals affected by depression [134] [135] [136] . Exercise is considered a first-line treatment in mild to moderate depression [135, 137, 138] . It has been shown that aerobic exercise on the treadmill significantly upregulated the expression and content of central components of the BDNF-serotonin system in different regions of the brain, e.g. cortex and hippocampus, in adult rats physically trained lifelong (from 2 to 18 months of age) [139] . In addition, BDNF released from human brain has been shown to increase with an acute bout of exercise [140, 141] . Besides that, six weeks of voluntary exercise on the running wheel decrease anxiety-like behaviors and exerted antidepressant-like effects, which were accompanied by stimulated hippocampal J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f neuroplasticity, mitochondrial activity and gene expression associated energy metabolism and BDNF regulation in C57BL/6 mice [112] .",

Indeed, recently it was demonstrated that FNDC5/irisin is an essential pathway involved in synaptic plasticity and memory induced by exercise in an Alzheimer's disease experimental model using C57BL/6 mice [24] . Another important brain factor stimulated by exercise is REST ( [120] and revised in [23] ). REST is a master transcription factor that down-regulates genes linked to cell-death in differentiated neurons and enhances the expression of other genes that induce resistance to the ageing process and the preservation of cognitive function [23] ). Our group demonstrated that experimental chronic hyperglycemia in Wistar rats provoked a marked REST reduction specifically in the hippocampus [120, 142] . However, our group also demonstrated that eight weeks of voluntary physical activity increased REST expression, which was also accompanied by an increase in BDNF expression in the hippocampus of aged C57BL/6 male mice [57] . Thus, the relationship between enhanced cognition and REST expression appears to be related to the repression of cell death-associated genes, suggesting that REST might be neuroprotective [23] .",

In addition, we showed that neopterin increases the antioxidant capacity of the cell, enhances mitochondrial bioenergetics, and reduces inflammation and oxidative stress in the brain of na\u00efve mice [149, 150] .

We also showed that a pro-inflammatory state stimulates the production and release of neopterin by brain cells in the mouse hippocampus and striatum [149] . A well-known and potent stimulator for the formation of neopterin is the pro-inflammatory cytokine IFN-\uf067, that is secreted by Th1 cells during activation of the immune system [149, 151] .

Our group showed that neopterin is increased in the blood of athletes who completed a multi-sport competition, including off-road running, mountain biking and kayaking (total 90km). The increased levels of neopterin occurred in parallel with muscle damage [40] . Urinary neopterin levels were also shown to be increased in rugby and marathon athletes and the levels correlated with other inflammatory and oxidative biomarkers [39, 154] . Neopterin has also been used as a biomarker in response to mixed martial arts [155] and body-building training [156] and has been proposed as a biomarker of fatigue and overtraining [157] . However, recently, experimental data from our group indicated that moderate intensity-treadmill running training induces an anti-inflammatory environment with reduced levels of neopterin in an animal model of inflammation J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f induced by LPS. Mechanistically, neopterin may activate the transcription factor Nrf2, a key regulator of the cellular antioxidant response, which will further enhance the cellular antioxidant defenses, mitochondrial activity and the anti-inflammatory environment [148] [149] [150] [151] . Supporting this state, our group demonstrated that six weeks of moderate-intensity physical exercise on a treadmill induced the expression of Nrf2 in the brain mouse [114] . Table 5 shows studies from literature relating the type of physical activity with neopterin levels in humans and animals. ",

This mechanism has been demonstrated in many scenarios, including J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f in immune cells-infiltrated muscle [167, 169] . Additionally, ROS production has been shown to be an activator of the NLRP3 inflammasome, an intracellular receptor for DAMPs that promotes the activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines [151] . ROS activating inflammasomes may be formed in the mitochondria and also in the cytosol by xanthine oxidase [170] . The generated of reactive species is crucial to the remodeling that occurs in skeletal muscle in response to physical exercise training. However, the changes caused by the physical exercise in the oxidative metabolism depend on the type, volume and workload of the training and are specific to each tissue [12, 171] . For example, it has been shown that the inflammatory peak occurs in the muscle during the first hours after an acute bout of resistance exercise [172] [173] [174] . However, moderate and chronic physical exercise reduces serum prostaglandin (biomarker of inflammation) levels in humans [175] .",

BH4 is an essential cofactor for the enzyme activity of aromatic amino-acid hydroxylases, all nitric oxide synthase isoforms, and alkylglycerol monooxygenase [197] . BH4 intracellular levels play, therefore, a key role in various biological systems, e.g., monoamine neurotransmitter synthesis [197] , cardiovascular and endothelial functions [198] , the immune system activation [195] and pain thresholds [195, 196, 199] . The levels of BH4 are tuned and finely regulated by three metabolic pathways: de novo synthesis, recycling and the salvage pathway (see BH4 pathways in Figure 4 ) [200] . The de novo pathways produce BH4 from GTP by three enzymatic steps catalyzed by the enzymes GTPCH, PTPS and sepiapterin reductase (SPR) [200] . [197] . Finally, once BH4 is oxidized to BH2, during its role as an enzyme cofactor, a NADH-dependent reaction will efficiently recycles it back to BH4 [200] .",

The regular practice of physical activity has been indicated to nonpharmacologically treat many painful disorders, since it had similar clinical outcomes as to the use of NSAIDS and non-narcotic analgesics [201, 202] . Low-intensity aerobic physical exercise during four weeks showed to reduce neuropathic pain by decreasing mechanical hypersensitivity and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the sciatic nerve and spinal cord [203] . Physically active animals (two weeks of exercise on a treadmill) with neuropathic pain show increased M2 (secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines) and less M1(secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines) polarization of macrophages at the site of the injury, while sedentary mice showed increased M1 over M2 macrophages in the sciatic nerve [204] . Moreover, the blockade of IL-10 systemically and locally in the muscle reduces the physical exercise-induced analgesic effect [205] . Regular practice of six weeks of voluntary running wheel has also shown to increase the anti-inflammatory cytokines in serum after chronic constriction injury [206] . In addition, low-intensity aerobic exercise on the treadmill has shown to reduce IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\uf061 levels in sciatic nerve and spinal cord in an animal model of sciatic nerve crush injury [206] .",

Chronic physical exercise offers protection against chronic non-communicable diseases, dementia and cognitive decline, among other diseases.

This makes the physical exercise a valuable tool to prevent infectious pandemics, such as COVID-19, or non-infectious ones, such as obesity. The impact of physical exercise on tissue homeostasis provokes an adaptive response which depends on the type, duration and intensity of the stimuli. The beneficial consequences of exercise on the health outcomes involve the modulation of the immune system. A pro-inflammatory phenotype is favored by physical inactivity. Conversely, the regular practice of moderate intensity physical exercise directs the immune response to an antiinflammatory status, that is believed to be the main desired molecular mechanism to increase the health outcomes. Thus, the preventive and/or therapeutic effect of physical exercise depends of exercise workload and dose-response relationships, which could be quantified by monitoring markers of the immune response in biological fluids.",

Adrenaline and noradrenaline are the fast-acting fight or flight hormones produced by the adrenal glands on direct signaling from the brain under a stressful stimulus. Cortisol is a steroid hormone also produced by the adrenal glands, not released instantly as adrenalin, but rather taking minutes since it involves a stepwise activation of the amygdala. Both, adrenaline and cortisol, rapidly increase during exercise and once released, adrenaline activates the sequential releases of corticotropin-releasing hormone by the hypothalamus, adrenocorticotropic hormone by the pituitary gland, and finally of cortisol by the adrenal glands (for revision see ref.[26,70]). The responses induced by the release of adrenaline and cortisol typically are upstream of the immune system response, and the proportion.Catecholamine signaling occurs though of the \uf062-adrenoceptors present on Tcells, natural killer cells, macrophages and neutrophils, which increase intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels by G-coupled protein activation[70].
