In a general automated negotiation, an agent may need to negotiate with other agents or humans whose (personality) type may not be known [2, 24]. However, knowing the types of other players can provide significant advantages to the agent in many situations in terms of having a better idea of how to approach or tailor the negotiation [6, 9, 10], potentially leading to better outcomes. The offer-counteroffer paradigm [8, 12] is a popular way of modeling automated negotiations. In this study, we deviate from the offer-counteroffer paradigm since the other negotiators can take actions for information exchange and not just to make offers and counteroffers.",

There is quite some work on modeling and prediction of opponent type in negotiation literature [1, 2] including usage of formal models such as game theory [4, 7] and Bayesian learning [26, 27] among others. However, there is relatively less work on analyzing the personality type of an opponent within the computation model of negotiation. POMDPs [11] have been used earlier in literature for modeling social interaction among humans in situations where information of the opponent has to be known [21]. More recently, preference elicitation in negotiation using the Gaussian uncertainty model has been developed in order to optimize the negotiation outcomes [14, 15]. [22] presents a POMDP based model for the development of a strategic agent for human persuasion via the usage of argumentative dialogs.",

As mentioned in subsect. 2.3, while emotions are part of the observations, in the current work, we do not condition reward values on the (observed) emotions. More specifically, the reward function for each personality type depends on whether a concession is made or not. For the Individualist, Cooperator and Competitor personality type, making a concession is not preferable for the agent; hence it is given a lower reward value. Please note that the meaning/value of concession by the same amount is different across the (3) personality types; hence the reward value is modeled accordingly. For example, between the Individualist and Cooperator agents, Individualists may never want to concede, but Cooperator will tend to concede at some time steps. For an Altruist, a concession is viewed as a positive since it helps its opponent, hence receives a high reward for a concede action.",

For example, if the POMDP uses the reward function of Individualist for an opponent who is Altruist due to incorrect modeling, it should be expected to return lesser EETR values than when it uses the correct reward function for Altruist. Figure 2 shows four plots, one per each personality type of the opponent. Each plot shows results for the experiment where we use the four different reward functions for a fixed personality type of the opponent [i.e., three incorrect and one correct reward function used].

In this experiment, we first make changes to the transcripts that are used to build the POMDP.

Our classification accuracy results performed in two ways, i.e., Pair-wise and One vs. Rest, both show that we obtain good quality results, which showcase that transcripts containing personality-related information can indeed help to improve automated negotiation technology.",
