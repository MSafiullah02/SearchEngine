            "text": "The development of electron microscopy was pivotal in the establishment of virology as a scientific discipline. Viruses are smaller than the limit of resolution of the light microscope, which is about 0.3 \u03bcm, or 300 nm. Poxviruses were for many years considered amongst the largest of viruses, being just about visible in the light microscope using dark-field optics or certain staining techniques. In recent years, much larger viruses have been discovered but so far none of these have been shown to be human pathogens. Nevertheless, these newly discovered viruses are driving a re-examination of the limits of the concept of virus. For example, the virions of megavirus and mimivirus, both infectious for Acanthamoeba, are about 0.5 \u03bcm in diameter, have a DNA genome up to 1.26 Mb in size and code up to 1120 proteins. The virions of pandoraviruses are 1\u20131.2 \u03bcm in size, have a linear DNA genome up to 2.8 Mb, and code up to 2500 proteins. An even larger virus, Pithovirus (recently isolated from Siberian permafrost), is 1.5 \u03bcm in size, the size of a small bacterium, with >2500 putative protein-coding sequences, of which only 6% have recognizable relationships with genes from known viruses, microorganisms, or eukaryotes. At the same time, viruses that are smaller than those in previously known taxa have been found, so virologists must now be prepared to work with viruses as large as bacteria and as small as large protein molecules (Table 3.1\n).",

Later, metal shadow-casting of purified virus preparations improved the visualization of virions, but still not enough. Beginning in the 1950s, ultra-thin sectioning of virus-infected cells became widespread, providing more virion detail and also the beginning of the science of ultrastructural cytopathology\u2014virion morphogenesis, intracellular localization of virus structures and cellular organelles and coincident damage to host cell structures. In 1959, visualization of viral ultrastructure was taken to a still higher level of resolution when Sydney Brenner and Robert Horne developed negative staining. In this method, a solution of potassium phosphotungstate (or other electron-dense salts) is added to a virus suspension on a coated specimen grid; the metal ions surround and fill the interstices in the surface of virions giving a negative image in the electron beam, thus revealing structural details not previously seen. A remarkable diversity of virus structures can be seen in negatively stained preparations. Electron micrographs of virions and infected cells from different families of viruses are shown in the various chapters of this book (see Figs. 1.3 and 1.4Fig. 1.3Fig. 1.4 for comparison of ultra-thin sectioning versus negative staining).",

For example, applying this technique to several picornaviruses revealed that the polypeptides of each of the three larger structural proteins are packaged to form wedge-shaped eight-stranded antiparallel \u03b2-barrel subassemblies (Fig. 3.2\n). The overall contour of picornavirus virions reflects the packing of these subassemblies. Relatively unstructured amino acid chains form loops that project from the main wedge-shaped domains. Some loops form flexible arms that interlock with the arms of adjacent wedge-shaped subassemblies, thereby providing physical stability to the virion. Other loops, those involved in virion attachment to the host cell, harbor the antigenic sites (epitopes) that are the targets of the host\u2019s neutralizing antibody response against the virus.",

The two strands of poxvirus DNA are covalently cross-linked at each terminus (forming hairpin ends), so that upon denaturation, the molecule becomes a large single-stranded circle. The linear double-stranded DNA of several DNA viruses and the linear single-stranded RNA of retroviruses contain repeat sequences at the ends of the molecule that permit circularization. Adenovirus DNA contains inverted terminal repeats; these are also a feature of the single-stranded DNA of parvoviruses. Another type of terminal structure occurs in adenoviruses, hepadnaviruses, and parvoviruses (and some single-stranded RNA viruses such as the picornaviruses and caliciviruses); all of these viruses contain a protein covalently linked to the 5\u2032-terminus (the 5\u2032 cap) with an essential function in priming replication of the genome.",

As 1 kb, or for double-stranded DNA 1 kbp, contains enough genetic information to code for about one average-sized protein, it might be surmised that viral DNAs contain anywhere between two and 200 genes, coding for some two to 200 proteins in poxviruses and more than 2500 proteins in the giant viruses of amoeba. However, the relationship between any particular nucleotide sequence and its protein product(s) is not straightforward. On the one hand, the DNA of most of the larger viruses, similar to that of mammalian cells, contains what appears to be redundant information in the form of repeat sequences, thus the coding capacity of large viral genomes may be overestimated. On the other hand, coding capacity might be underestimated: first, a given DNA or mRNA sequence may be read in up to three alternate reading frames, producing up to three proteins with different amino acid sequences; second, both strands of a double-stranded viral DNA molecule may be transcribed, each transcript yielding a different protein; third, genes may overlap, yielding various transcripts and protein products; and finally, a single primary RNA transcript may be spliced or cleaved in several different ways to yield a number of distinct mRNAs, each of which may be translated into a different protein, or a single polyprotein translation product may be subsequently cleaved by proteolysis to yield multiple discrete proteins.",

There is no vertebrate virus RNA genome that is a covalently linked circle, with the exception of the very small circular single-stranded RNA of delta hepatitis virus which has a structure resembling that of plant viroids.

Icosahedra have axes of two-, three-, and fivefold rotational symmetry that pass through the edges, faces, and vertices of the icosahedron, respectively (Fig. 3.6\n). Evidence from electron microscopy and biophysical techniques confirmed that most spherical viruses had far more than 60 protein subunits. Drawing inspiration from Buckminster Fuller\u2019s geodesic domes, Donald Caspar and Aaron Klug discovered a solution to the problem\u2014they proposed that spherical viruses were structured like miniature geodesic domes, that is, the identical subunits are asymmetrical and are bonded together not in equivalent, but in quasiequivalent ways wherein there can be slight deformation of optimum bonding distances and angles wherein far more subunits can be accommodated to make larger structures. They also developed the idea of self-assembly after considering the viral assembly process as a type of crystallization process.",

The structural units on the faces and edges of adenovirus virions, for example, bond to six neighboring capsomers and are referred to as hexons or hexamers; those at the vertices bond to five neighbors and are called pentons or pentamers (Fig. 3.6). In the virions of some viruses both hexons and pentons are composed of the same polypeptide(s), whereas the hexons or pentons of other viruses are formed from different polypeptides. The arrangements of structural units on the surface of virions of two icosahedral model viruses are shown in Fig. 3.6. Because of variations in the arrangement of the structural units on different viruses, some viruses appear rather hexagonal in outline and some appear nearly spherical. Even within rather smooth overall surface configurations, at higher resolution functional protrusions, bulges, and projections (often housing cellular attachment ligands and neutralizing epitopes) can be seen. There are also depressions, clefts, and canyons that may also house attachment ligands but usually not neutralizing epitopes.",

The occurrence of identical protein\u2013protein interfaces on the structural units promotes the symmetrical assembly of the helix. In helically symmetrical nucleocapsids, the RNA genome forms a spiral within the nucleocapsid (Fig. 3.7\n). Many plant viruses with helical nucleocapsids are rod-shaped, flexible or rigid, and non-enveloped. The helical structure of tobacco mosaic virus was among the first viral structures determined by negative staining electron microscopy\u2014its detailed structure was resolved by X-ray crystallography. However, in all viruses of vertebrates with helical symmetry, the nucleocapsid is wound into a secondary coil and enclosed within a lipoprotein envelope, for example rhabdoviruses (see Fig. 27.1); and paramyxoviruses (see Fig. 26.2).",

Different kinds of envelope-associated proteins are associated with at least four crucial activities: binding to receptors, membrane fusion, uncoating, and receptor modification. For example, fusion proteins are involved in both viral entry and viral release, in many cases promoting the fusion of viral envelope with cellular membranes at virus entry and promoting virus \u201cpinching off\u201d at virus exit by budding. Moreover, before entry into the cell, viruses may be converted to a primed state to facilitate uptake and infection of target cells. This primed state usually involves conformational rearrangements of the virion surface proteins, making these structures responsive to various triggers. For example, upon entry into the host the hemagglutinin (HA0) of influenza viruses is cleaved at a specific site by the extracellular enzyme tryptase Clara, generating a primed modified structure composed of two unique subunits (HA1 and HA2). After entry of the virion into the host cell via receptor-mediated endocytosis, the primed hemagglutinin molecule then is activated when exposed to the low pH within the endosome. Activated hemagglutinin mediates endosome membrane disruption or fusion, thereby allowing the release of the viral RNA genome into the cytoplasm of the host cell.",

In most cases, viral envelope proteins are denatured within a few minutes at temperatures of 55 to 60\u00b0C, with the result that the virion is no longer capable of normal cellular attachment, penetration, and/or uncoating. Many viral capsid proteins are only slightly more heat resistant. At ambient temperature, the rate of decay of infectivity is slower but significant, especially in the summer or in the tropics. In order to preserve infectivity, viral preparations must therefore be stored at low temperature; 4\u00b0C (on wet ice or in a refrigerator) is usually satisfactory for a day or so, but long-term preservation requires much lower temperatures. Two convenient temperatures are \u221270\u00b0C, the temperature of solid CO2 (dry ice) and of many laboratory mechanical freezers, and \u2212196\u00b0C, the temperature of liquid nitrogen.",
