In The Lancet Infectious Diseases, Simon de Lusignan and colleagues1 report on the characteristics of the first 3802 people tested for SARS-CoV-2 within the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) sentinel primary care surveillance network. Unlike most previous studies that examined risk factors for poor prognosis,2, 3 de Lusignan and colleagues1 report characteristics associated with susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

Twice-weekly automatic data downloads provide a real-time warning of impending epidemics. In January, 2020, the network expanded to include the testing for SARS-CoV-2 among individuals presenting with symptoms of influenza or respiratory infection. COVID-19 surveillance data, supplemented with data from contact tracing or routine National Health Service facilities, were linked with electronic health records. Of 3802 tests, 587 (15\u00b74%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Prevalence of infection was less than 5% in patients younger than 18 years (23 patients were positive [4\u00b76%] of 499 tested) but almost four times as high in people aged 40 years or older (480 [18\u00b72%] of 2637). After adjustment for other factors, infection risk was higher among men than women (odds ratio [OR] 1\u00b755 [95% CI 1\u00b727\u20131\u00b789]), in black people than white people (OR 4\u00b775 [2\u00b765\u20138\u00b751]), and in people with obesity than normal-weight people (1\u00b741 [1\u00b704\u20131\u00b791]). Infection risk was also higher in those living in more deprived or in urban versus rural locations. Surprisingly, household size did not significantly affect infection risk. Among chronic comorbidities examined, only those with chronic kidney disease had an increased risk of infection, whereas the risk in active smokers was around half that observed in never smokers.",

However, the data are not fully representative of the general population, excluding those with mild or no symptoms and instead reflecting consultation patterns, with over-representation of women and older people but fewer smokers.7 Lower thresholds for presentation (eg, among women) could dilute test positivity compared with groups who might present only if they are more severely ill. It is also possible that there are unmeasured confounders\u2014eg, social and workplace exposures, interactions, and behaviours, which might explain increased risk in some groups.",

The role of ethnicity in greater susceptibility and poorer prognosis is a growing concern and deserving of further study. It seems that most comorbidities (except chronic kidney disease), although important for predicting prognosis, do not have a major part in susceptibility to infection. Regarding the results on smoking, it is likely that they could reflect consulting patterns and higher rates of non-infectious cough among smokers than non-smokers. Smoking seems important as a risk factor for poor prognosis,4 but studies are conflicting, and the association merits further investigation. The one major modifiable risk factor is obesity, which presents a double problem of increasing susceptibility to infection, as well as the risk of severe consequences.9\n",
