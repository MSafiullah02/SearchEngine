Due to the physiologic changes that occur during pregnancy, pregnant women may experience severe outcomes when infected with a respiratory pathogen [1]. Infection with influenza during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of maternal mortality, preterm birth, and infants that are small for gestational age [2], [3]. To prevent these adverse maternal and fetal outcomes, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends immunization with influenza vaccine during pregnancy [4]. The ACIP also recommends maternal immunization with the Tetanus-Diphtheria-acellular Pertussis (Tdap) vaccine [5] given that, although adult infection with pertussis is often mild, maternal antibodies transferred to the infant can prevent pertussis-related morbidity and mortality in this vulnerable age group [6].",

There is currently a robust pipeline of RSV vaccine candidates in various preclinical and clinical phases of development. One strategy targets protection of infants less than three months of age through maternal vaccination. Maternal RSV antibodies are efficiently transferred transplacentally to the fetus during gestation, and have been associated with decreased risk of RSV infection in young infants [10], [11], [12]. For this reason, maternal immunization appears to be a promising strategy to prevent severe RSV disease in infants. However, the direct benefit to pregnant women from maternal immunization against RSV is currently unknown.",

A case-series study was the first to describe severe RSV infection during pregnancy: two of the three cases were hospitalized and required mechanical ventilation [13]. In addition, several large prospective maternal cohort studies of influenza-like illness (ILI) evaluated during influenza vaccine trials have described maternal RSV infection incidences of 3.9/1000 person-years in Nepal, 5.3/1000 person-months in South Africa, and 0.3/1000 person-days in Mongolia [14], [15], [16]. Recently, a retrospective multi-country study of ARI-related hospitalizations among pregnant women identified 846 women who were tested for RSV during the influenza season, 21 (2.5%) had detectable RSV by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [17]. Of the 21 cases, 13 had a pregnancy complication, 8 were diagnosed with pneumonia, and 6 had subsequent preterm birth. We previously described the frequency and clinical impact of respiratory viruses in women seen during the second and third trimester of pregnancy at a primary obstetrical and gynecological clinic [18]. In this manuscript we expand on the clinical and diagnostic laboratory findings of pregnant women infected with RSV.",

Utilizing both techniques we identified RSV infection in acute samples by PCR and convalescent samples by serology. RSV was identified by PCR in 11% (7/65) of pregnant women with symptoms of ARI at their initial enrollment. Taking into account one additional woman who exhibited an acute serologic RSV infection, the RSV attack rate was at least 12% (8/65) of ARI cases. An RSV attack rate as high as 13% (10/77) is estimated if calculated using the first ARI episode. This is substantial given that the RSV season in Houston was relatively mild compared to previous years [28], and greater than reported by maternal studies of respiratory illness in Nepal and Mongolia, where RSV accounted for 2% and 2.4% of ARI cases, respectively [14], [15]. However, because fever was an inclusion criteria for those studies, and fever occurs in less than one-third of adult RSV infections, these numbers may be an underestimate [29]. Our attack rate of 12\u201313% is similar to that of other studies with broad ARI inclusion criteria in adults. In a four year study of ARI in high risk adults, RSV was detected in 46 of 519 (10%) cases [9]. Similarly, a 20-year study of otherwise healthy adults found that 7% of individuals with respiratory illness were infected with RSV [30].",

Recent studies have reported findings wherein at least 20% of women of childbearing age had serologic evidence of an acute RSV infection [21], [31]. In our study, the percentage of healthy pregnant women with a Western Blot profile of a recent prior RSV infection increased significantly as the RSV season progressed. These women had enrollment dates that followed the peak of RSV illness in Houston. This suggests that these healthy controls may have been infected with RSV during the course of this study. A caveat in our method of defining the RSV season is the use of the RSV antigen test as a marker for infection. A recent study found that utilizing PCR as an alternative diagnostic tool allows for a more expanded RSV season and, as a result, an increase in the RSV cases reported [32].",

In our study women who reported fever also had symptoms of LRTI. Although none of the women were diagnosed with pneumonia, the morbidity attributable to RSV was significant. One woman did report symptoms of LRTI during hospitalization for fever and uterine contractions and was found to have PCR-confirmed RSV several days after hospital discharge.

This is also evident by their comparatively greater levels of neutralizing antibodies and palivizumab-like antibodies [9], [33]. Three women who were re-enrolled and had paired sera, exhibited an RSV infection profile despite negative PCR. It is likely that these women were exposed to RSV sometime between their first and second enrollment visit. Although we cannot definitively establish causality, it is possible that RSV infection was responsible for some or all of the symptoms these three women reported. Twenty-eight healthy controls had serologic evidence of a recent prior RSV infection by Western Blot testing of a single serum sample, suggesting they had been infected with RSV at sometime within the year. The proportion of healthy controls with a Western blot profile of a recent prior RSV infection significantly increased in the latter part of the RSV season. This suggests that many of these healthy women had been infected with RSV earlier in the current RSV season and, that by the time of study enrollment, sufficient time had elapsed to develop an RSV-specific antibody response.",

The case definition is limited in that it is dependent on self-reported symptoms, and LRTI was not confirmed by radiologic study. In addition, because serum samples were collected at the time of enrollment, only one serum sample was available for most patients, unless participants chose to re-enroll in the study at a later time.
