The median interval from transplantation to infection was 168 days; 28% were receiving corticosteroids, 28% were lymphocytopenic, and 13% were neutropenic.

A recent report restricted its analysis to HSCT patients from whom coronavirus was detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. In this study of 37 episodes in 35 patients, 54% of whom died within 90 days, 57% had a copathogen, but mortality did not significantly differ between those with and without a copathogen [2] . Whatever the pathogenic role of non-MERS, non-SARS coronaviruses in HSCT patients, we have no effective interventions in the treatment of the infections caused by them. Murai and colleagues in Kobe, Japan, retrospectively examined the incidence of cerebral microbleeds (CMB) and their clinical significance in 74 patients with infective endocarditis (IE) seen at their hospital over 77 months. The 74 patients were those with IE who had undergone brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and whose data were available for examination. CMB were defined as hypointense lesions seen on T2 or susceptibility-weighted imaging that were <10 mm in diameter using either a 1.5 or 3.0 Tesla MR system. Those \u226510 mm were classified as cerebral hemorrhages. The median interval from the time of IE diagnosis to brain imaging was 1 day (interquartile range: 0-3 days). Of the 49 (66.2%) who underwent cardiac surgery as part of their treatment, the MRI was performed a median of 7 days prior to the operation in 46.",

Twenty-four of the 40 (60%) with CMB and 24 of the 34 (70.6%) without CMB underwent cardiac surgery; 17 of the 24 CMB and 13 of the 34 non-CMB patients underwent surgery within 2 weeks of IE diagnosis.

Although retrospective, limited in size, and arising from a single center, this study indicates that microbleeds in patients are generally benign and, by themselves, are not an indication to delay needed valve surgery with its associated anticoagulation. A previously healthy 57-year-old woman presented in shock after a 3-day history of cramping upper abdominal pain and vomiting. In addition to being hypotensive, she was hypoxemic, hypothermic, and had cyanotic extremities, as well as abdominal tenderness.
