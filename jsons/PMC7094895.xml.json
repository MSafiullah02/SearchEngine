            "text": "Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is considered an effective rescue therapy for severe acute lung or cardiac disease [1, 2]. Large-volume intravenous fluid infusions are often required after ECMO initiation [1, 3] due to haemorrhage [4\u20137] or to minimize venous access insufficiency and target an appropriate ECMO flow [1, 3]. Despite increasing experience [8\u201310] and major technical improvements [11], major fluid overload remains a common characteristic in ECMO patients [12]. In addition, acute kidney injury (AKI) with need for renal replacement therapy (RRT) is one of the most frequent additional organ failures, occurring in ~50 % of ECMO patients [4\u20137]. AKI is known to be associated with negative outcomes [13, 14] in patients requiring ECMO and may also predispose towards development of positive fluid balance (FB) [15\u201319]. Although fluid overload is common in ECMO patients [12] and the possible adverse effects of positive FB on mortality are widely recognized [15\u201319], the specific impact of fluid overload on outcome in adult ECMO patients has never been investigated. Moreover, FB status during ECMO is a potentially modifiable factor, while if optimally managed may improve patient outcomes.",

CRRT (Prismaflex\u2122; Gambro, Lund, Sweden) was performed via the ECMO circuit in all patients. Blood entered the CRRT machine immediately distal to the pump-head and was returned proximal to the oxygenator [21]. For patients with no active bleeding, anticoagulation was provided by the ECMO circuit to target an activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) of 50\u201370 s. The anticoagulant strategy was the same whether CRRT was required or not. After ECMO removal, a dialysis central catheter was inserted if CRRT was still needed. The CRRT filter was routinely changed after 72 h of continuous use (manufacturer recommendation) or earlier due to clotting.",

In the past decade, the view that liberal fluid administration preserves renal function has been challenged [32\u201335]. A number of studies, in different settings, have stressed the negative impact of fluid overload on mortality, oxygenation, and duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU LOS [16, 26, 36\u201340]. In a retrospective analysis of 1,400 patients enrolled in the RENAL study [41], negative daily FB was associated with decreased risk of death at 90 days, even after adjustments for propensity score and all illness severity markers [26]. ECMO patients are especially exposed to fluid overload, and FB management is a common issue in this population [42\u201344]. Selewski et al. [44], in a retrospective study of 57 ECMO children requiring CRRT, recently addressed the association between mortality and fluid overload at RRT initiation, fluid removal during CRRT and the kinetics of fluid removal. Median fluid overload at CRRT initiation and CRRT discontinuation were significantly lower in survivors. However, after adjusting for confounders, fluid overload at CRRT discontinuation was not significantly associated with mortality, highlighting the fact that fluid status early in the patient\u2019s course is most predictive of survival. The addition of in-line continuous haemofiltration to the ECMO circuit (which avoids the need for a separate central venous access line) has been suggested as a potential solution for improved fluid homeostasis in concert with native diuresis [45]. In 15 newborn patients matched with 46 controls, such addition of CRRT to the ECMO circuit improved outcomes by reducing time on ECMO and on ventilation as well as improving fluid balance management [43]. Similarly, animal models of ECMO have suggested there may be a direct protective effect from CRRT with reduced inflammatory markers, improvement of mean perfusion pressure, systemic vascular resistance and oxygen delivery [46]. However, CRRT might increase the risk of ECMO oxygenator failure. In our series, the number of ECMO circuits used was significantly higher in the CRRT group (Table ESM-8), a finding which has been reported by others as associated with worse outcome [47]. In addition, we did not find any independent association between AKI and positive FB at day 3. However, patients were classified at ECMO initiation, and some of the 74 no-AKI patients could have developed AKI thereafter.",

Although fluid overload may reflect only the illness severity of these patients [12], these results raise the possibility that early control of FB on ECMO may be beneficial. However, ECMO may also intrinsically predispose to fluid overload. Recurrent suction episodes due to access insufficiency may both predispose to increased fluid administration and represent inadequate ECMO support which in turn manifests as adverse mortality outcomes. The ECMO centrifugal pumps are preload dependent, and intravenous fluids are, especially in the first 48 h after ECMO initiation, frequently administered to target appropriate ECMO flow [1, 3]. In fact, the positive FB seen during the first two days on ECMO did not show an association with 90-day mortality (Table 2; Fig. 2). As demonstrated with acute lung injury with sepsis [48], further studies are warranted to study the outcome of a strategy combining early aggressive fluid resuscitation associated with later fluid restriction in ECMO patients.",

Then, this finding could emphasize the need for proactive strategies to reduce fluid overload as soon as possible. Recent advances in incorporation of CRRT with ECMO devices allow thorough control of fluid balance with lower exposure to diuretics [44]. This study should prompt clinicians and researchers to develop trials to confirm the negative impact of fluid overload in ECMO on outcome and to develop specific strategies for management of AKI and FB. Proactive use of CRRT and diuretics during ECMO, aiming to improve fluid overload as soon as possible, might be investigated.",

            "text": "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that an association of positive FB with unfavourable outcome has been reported in a large adult ECMO cohort. Our findings have potential therapeutic implications and may lead to studies comparing a conservative versus liberal fluid therapy approach in these unique patients. Our study, however, has a retrospective design and was performed in a single centre with no standardization of the timing of CRRT during ECMO. In addition, our results depend on local experience, practice and management of ECMO and CRRT. However, we believe other expert centres can reproduce such clinical management. We studied a mixed population of patients with acute refractory cardiogenic shock and acute respiratory failure, who had received VA- or VV-ECMO support. We recognize that subgroups of such patients may behave differently and that this study is underpowered to detect variation between small populations. However, these two different populations had the same mortality rate. Moreover, even after multiple adjustments and propensity score use, the negative impact of FB on mortality was still noted in both ECMO populations. We were not able to obtain accurate FB data before ECMO initiation. However, a high proportion of patients received ECMO during their first day in ICU (115 of 172 patients). Similarly, the dose of vasopressors was not collected. A constant haemodynamics SOFA subscore at 4 in both survivor and non-survivor groups suggests that the epinephrine or norepinephrine dose was greater than 0.1 \u00b5g/kg/min at ICU admission and at ECMO initiation. The type of fluids used was not collected. However, hydroxyethyl starch, which has been shown to be associated with a need for RRT [49, 50], was not available during the study period. We cannot exclude that the results of our multivariable analyses might have been biased by residual confounding not accounted for in this study. Finally, although we have shown that positive FB on day 3 of ECMO is associated with adverse outcomes, this study cannot rule out that those associations may simply reflect the extreme illness severity. Whether strategies to limit fluid accumulation either are possible or would change patient outcomes must be determined.",
