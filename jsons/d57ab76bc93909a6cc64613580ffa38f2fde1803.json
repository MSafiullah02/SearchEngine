The number of COVID-19 cases reported since then showed a gradual increase and included both imported and locally transmitted cases. Since the country followed an aggressive policy of contact tracing and isolation the health authorities were able to contain the situation 4-6 . However, on 22 April 2020, a sailor from a Sri Lanka Navy camp outside the capital, Colombo, who was actively engaged in contact tracing, tested positive for COVID -19 , and 19 more sailors tested positive on the same day 7 . Since then the outbreak has escalated, but has been contained within Navy camps, and many of the COVID-19 positive sailors have been asymptomatic 8 .

In mitigation, the focus is to slow down the spread of the virus and achieve a staggered onset. Although such measures would continue to allow the spread of the disease, the health services are unlikely to be overwhelmed due to the slow spread of the virus and communities would develop herd immunity, thereby easing the burden on the countries. The measures adopted by the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom (at least in the early stages of COVID-19 spread), were focused on mitigation 11, 12 . Suppression methods were focused on stopping the spread completely, and the measures are generally more forceful than for disease mitigation. China, Vietnam and New Zealand adopted suppression measures which enabled them to flatten the curve and reduce the burden on their health services 13 .

We did not include the first case reported in Sri Lanka in the analysis, as the second case was reported more than six weeks later and none of the cases reported subsequently were linked to the first case. Relevant We have applied the SIR (susceptible, infected and removed/recovered) model, given its reliability as a model applicable to large populations facilitating the predictions in disease outbreaks 21, 22 . In the SIR model, Susceptible (S) individuals are those at risk of infection, infected (I) indicates individuals who are infected, and recovered or removed (R) includes those who may have developed immunity or died. Movement between these three categories is governed by \u03b2 and \u03b3 which describe the \"rate\" of the infection and the infectious period, respectively 23 . The COVID-19 Stringency Index was used as a proxy to replace the parameter \u03b2. The per-capita recovery rate, \uf067, is usually difficult to influence, except through the introduction of vaccines 24 . Hence \uf067 is highly unlikely to change over time during the current COVID-19 pandemic. In the absence of adequate local data due to the limited number of cases, we have considered 11 days as the recovery period to estimate the parameter in this study 25 .

Obtaining quality data on the numbers of cases, deaths and tests have been a challenge. Concerns regarding poor quality of data at the onset of any epidemic and problems in getting sharable data readily have been previously documented. Further, we are also limited by the paucity of real time data on implementation of the mitigation and suppression measures employed and to what extent these measures were adhered to by different population groups at national and subnational levels.

Thomas Hale et al describe an index, based on the degree of stringency of government policies towards managing the COVID-19 pandemic 15 . The stringency index, developed by a group of researchers from the University of Oxford, considers multiple indicators including policies such as school closures, travel bans, and financial indicators such as fiscal and monetary measures. The index simply refers to the strictness of government policies in each country and is not necessarily indicative of how effective such policies are. The stringency index varies from country to country and to varying degrees with time, depending on the local disease situation, as was seen in Singapore with the emergence of new disease clusters among immigrant workers 15 .",

Further, we plotted C19SI and cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases for seven selected countries with a view to validating the index for its applicability as a projection tool.

Compared to other countries, the Sri Lankan Government initiated control measures early. These measures closely resemble the measures taken by Vietnam. The control measures were escalated rapidly just after the first locally transmitted case was reported, and the Government Response Index reached its highest level within two weeks. Although Italy and Spain had escalations similar to that of Sri Lanka, it was after a considerable lag period. The United Kingdom and United States of America demonstrated an even longer lag period. Singapore and South Korea have gradually enforced stringency measures and demonstrate a stringency index below the other countries. Panel B of Figure 2, shows the number of COVID-19 cases reported for the same time period using a log scale. Countries that initiated their response early and escalated it before the case-load increased have been able to maintain a lower number of cumulative cases: Vietnam, Sri Lanka (less than 1000 cases) and South Korea (less than 10000 cases). Countries that had a high stringency index with a delayed escalation have demonstrated a larger number of cases: Italy, Spain, UK (around 200,000 cases) and USA (over 1.4 million cases).",

These predictions are in line with some other local predictions done by Weerasinghe (2020) using a SIR model with an active caseload of 1000 peaking after 90 days of onset 28 and a separate group predicting based on a logistic regression model a total case load of 998 (+/-6 cases) and ending by 20 July 19 . Similar findings are obtained from the model proposed by 29 also using a SIR model. Further, based on our analysis, we have projected for C19SI or Stringency Index to be relaxed from 94 to 80 on 14 May and further relaxed to 60 by 1 June. The projection model has estimated that the number of active cases would increase from 815 (95%CI, 753-877) peaking on 17 May to 4,526 (95%CI, 4,309-4,744) peaking on 30 June 2020. Based on the information available on COVID-19 cases and deaths reported from different countries, it is clear that varying levels of mitigation and suppression measures have been employed by different countries. The comparison of C19SI with the corresponding number of cases of COVID 19 reported by each country demonstrates a relationship between the timing of the response measures and the combination of the response measures put in place. In their report Walker et.al from the Imperial College group suggested that delays in implementing suppression strategies could lead to worse outcomes and fewer lives saved. For example, if suppression strategies are initiated when death rates are at 0.2 per 100 000 population per week and are sustained, this will save up to 38.7 million lives globally. Even if suppression strategies are initiated late when the death rates are as high as 1.6 per 100 000 population per week this could still save up to 30.7 million lives.
