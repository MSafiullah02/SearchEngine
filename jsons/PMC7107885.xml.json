Furthermore, many pathologists in China have been slow in complying with precautions promulgated to prevent the transmission of both bloodborne and aerosolized pathogens [11, 12]. In fact, 17 autopsies of patients with SARS or suspected SARS were performed under such inadequate conditions [13\u201317].",

The main modes of transmission are through droplet spread and close/direct contact, but situations conducive to aerosol generation appeared to be associated with higher risk, and there are still many factors concerning the mode of transmission and the environmental risk that need to be clarified [18]. Studies have shown that SARS-CoV can be found in sputum, tears, blood, urine, feces, and sweat glands. The virus can be shed in the feces for 30 days, and it has been shown to survive on hard surfaces for >24 h [19, 20]. Therefore, autopsies involving SARS autopsies may be considered more dangerous than are autopsies involving more common biohazard group 3 organisms, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Autopsies involving SARS should be performed in at least a BSL-3 laboratory.",

Since the last autopsy was performed, our BSL-3 autopsy laboratory has been maintained, and it has now become the autopsy center for the SARS research laboratory network system and emergency infectious diseases in China.

            "text": "The biosafety of our BSL-3 autopsy laboratory has been ensured in 4 ways: through the design of the facility, use of PPE, decontamination, and administrative regulation. First, use of a BSL-3 ventilation system is the prerequisite for SARS autopsies. Second, because PPE is the first barrier of protection, we invested in the maximum protection available, including gas masks, impermeable protective clothing, and 3 layers of gloves. Because the use of oscillating saws, spray, and aspirators hoses may generate infectious aerosols, and because dissection of lungs can also create aerosols and droplets [8, 9], respiratory protection for SARS autopsies is especially important. The combined filter system of the gas masks used in our facility provided the highest level of protection available to the investigators. Although the CDC recommended that N-100 particulate respirators or powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) with HEPA filters should be used if aerosols may be generated [6, 21], PAPRs were not available in Beijing during the SARS outbreak; thus, the gas mask became the practical choice for use in our facility. However, we noticed that the gas masks made the investigators feel uncomfortable. Therefore, PAPRs would be the better choice in the future. The 3 layers of gloves made the investigators work more cumbersome and prone to mistakes, but this was nevertheless necessary for secure protection. Third, a 3-step procedure for decontamination of PPE was strictly followed. This was indispensable for the safety of the investigators, laboratory, and environment. Last but not least, we strictly adhered to administration controls, including rigorous biosafety training, supervision, and operational procedures. Our experiences suggest that monitoring personal behaviors, together with teaching of biosafety and correct attitudes to those involved in the autopsies, best ensure the safety of autopsy performance. It is noteworthy that safety administration may be neglected until something goes wrong. For example, 2 SARS cases that appeared at the end of 2003 were laboratory acquired [22, 23]. The small SARS outbreak in late March and mid-April 2004 in China also originated from contamination of 2 researchers at the National Institute of Virology in China's Center for Disease Control [24]. These incidences indicated that safety precautions and the personal attitudes of staff members are what really counts, provided that stringent engineering and PPE standards are applied. On the basis of our experience, compared with the experience at the facilities at which the 3 accidents occurred, we feel that conscientiousness about biosafety cannot be overly stressed.",

When confronting the potential threats of novel emerging infectious diseases and bioterrorist events, we need a better-prepared national BSL-3 laboratory network, including an autopsy laboratory, research laboratory, and mobile autopsy facilities. Such facilities could be capable of response to public health events. As a result of the imbalance in economic development in China and of China's vast territory, and considering the costs of remolding old facilities and of new construction, a mobile autopsy facility constructed to operate at BSL 3 or 4 would be beneficial in providing autopsy support to regions with inadequate facilities when they are confronted with contagious cases. Such a laboratory could be set up in a specially designed bus with 2 sections, including a diagnostic laboratory and an autopsy room equipped with an autonomous water supply and sewage system, a heating system, and necessary medical equipment, allowing one to perform autopsies of patients with infectious cases in rural conditions [25].",
