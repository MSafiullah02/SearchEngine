(13) as well as four other peptide variants (mutations 1\u20134) containing mutations at different charged residues (Fig. 1). The synthetic peptides were incubated with CaM in the presence of Ca2+ or EGTA. We observed formation of a CaM-peptide complex as a shift in the migration of the CaM band of the wild-type sequence (dubbed ACE2T2). At a synthetic peptide to CaM molar ratio of 2.5:1, a single faint band was observed above the CaM band, corresponding to the Ca2+-dependent CaM-peptide complex, which gradually increased in intensity as the molar ratio increased (Fig. 2). This observation strongly suggests that CaM is able to bind to the synthetic peptide. As predicted, no shift in the migration of CaM was observed in samples containing EGTA (Fig. 2). None of the peptide variants (mutations 1\u20134) showed a shift in CaM band (data not shown).",

A purified recombinant GST-CaM fusion protein or GST alone was incubated with cell lysates prepared from CHOP cells transfected with the FLAG-tagged full-length ACE2 plasmid. After washing, material that bound to glutathione Sepharose beads was separated using SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. ACE2 was present in the cell lysate, migrating as the 120-kDa band and the soluble form of ACE2 used as a positive control (Fig. 3A). In the lane containing the GST-CaM fusion protein, a band corresponding to ACE2 is present, suggesting CaM is able to bind full-length ACE2. As a specificity control, there were no bands corresponding to ACE2 when cell lysates were incubated with GST alone. The polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were also reprobed with anti-GST antibody to validate that equivalent bait proteins were present in the appropriate lanes and running at the appropriate molecular mass (Fig. 3B).

For these studies, we used Huh-7 cells, a cell line previously used to demonstrate a significant level of ACE2 expression (8). Analysis of the concentrated medium from cells treated with CaM-specific inhibitors showed a significant increase in soluble ACE2 activity compared with control medium (Fig. 4). In cells that were treated with trifluoperazine (25 \u03bcmol/liter), a 44.1 \u00b1 10.8% increase (P < 0.05 Student\u2019s t tests; unpaired, two tailed) in ACE2 activity after 16 h incubation was observed (Fig. 4A). When we switched to using a more potent CaM-specific inhibitor, calmidazolium (25 \u03bcmol/liter), in the presence of PMA and Bisindolylmaleimide I, we also observed significant ACE2 activity (51.1 \u00b1 7.4%) in the concentrated medium compared with control after 1 h treatment (P < 0.05, one-way ANOVA) (Fig. 4D). As demonstrated previously (8), PMA is able to stimulate ACE2 shedding (92.3 \u00b1 5.3%). The increase in ACE2 activity in the medium after CaM inhibitor treatments suggests that that CaM plays a role in the cleavage secretion of the ACE2 ectodomain. Cell lysates from the trifluoperazine treatment did not show significant changes in ACE2 activity reflecting that only a small percentage (<5%) of ACE2 is actually shed from the cell surface. There was no significant change in the cell lysates of the calmidazolium treated cells (data not shown).",

            "text": "The recent discovery of CaM involvement in the phosphorylation of ACE (27) and the ectodomain shedding of both ACE and ACE2 (13, 27) led us to look into the mechanism of how CaM regulates ACE2 ectodomain shedding. Interestingly, the CaM-binding site identified in ACE2 is structurally very different from the CaM binding motif identified for ACE; thus, the mechanism by which calmodulin regulates ACE2 shedding also must be very different; this is not entirely surprising, given that the homology between ACE and ACE2 resides primarily in the extracellular domain (2). Apart from ACE, CaM is known to bind to a number of other membrane-bound proteins that are shed from the cell surface. In a previous study, we showed that CaM binds the membrane-proximal cytoplasmic sequences of the platelet membrane glycoprotein GPVI (12). Similarly, CaM was shown to bind to the cytoplasmic domain of L-selectin (10). The juxtamembrane cytoplasmic sequence of ACE2 is homologous to membrane-proximal sequences of GPVI and L-selectin (Fig. 1), which were both previously shown to bind CaM (10, 11). This sequence similarity suggests, and our results confirm, that CaM is able to bind to the proposed CaM-binding region of ACE2 (13). Study of the interaction between CaM and a synthetic peptide analog of the putative CaM-binding site in ACE2 demonstrated that these proteins associate at a 1:2.5 molar ratio, within the range of values reported for other CaM-binding peptides in gel shift assays (11, 20\u201322). One of the common characteristics for CaM binding motifs in its target proteins is a conserved region of positively charged amino acids, which often is predicted to form amphipathic \u03b1-helices (28, 29). The design of the peptide variants illustrated in Fig. 1 was based on the hypothesis that the charged residues in the wild-type sequence will form an amphipathic \u03b1-helical structure. However, none of the peptides, including the wild-type sequence, adopted any defined conformations when analyzed by circular dichroism (data not shown). This indicates that the binding of CaM to the peptides is based on the amino acid sequence rather than the structural characteristic of the region.",

            "text": "CaM plays a pivotal role in the regulation of signal transduction for many biological processes, including regulating the function of integral membrane proteins (30, 31). The presence of a putative CaM binding site in ACE2 may thus indicate the involvement of CaM in the regulation of this membrane-bound carboxypeptidase. CaMis are often used to investigate the association of CaM and membrane-bound proteins. In this study, we observed a significant increase in ACE2 activity in the medium when Huh-7 cells, which endogenously express ACE2, were incubated with CaMi. This finding is consistent with studies of other cell surface molecules in which CaMi treatment stimulated ectodomain shedding. A previous study of the receptor tyrosine kinase (TrkA) showed that the ectodomain of this integral membrane protein can be shed by PMA and CaMi (32). PMA activates the protein kinase C (PKC) pathway, leading to increased cleavage-secretion of many membrane proteins, including ACE2 (33). In contrast, CaMi-induced ectodomain shedding of TrkA was reported to be independent of PKC activity, indicating that CaMi and PMA mediate cleavage-secretion by two distinctive signaling pathways (32). CaMi-induced shedding was also observed for other cell surface molecules such the adhesion molecule CD44 and the membrane-anchored precursor for TGF-\u03b1 (pro-TGF-\u03b1) (34, 35). Two different sheddases, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain (ADAM)-10 and ADAM17, have been reported to cause ectodomain shedding of CD44 by CaMi and PMA, respectively (34, 35), whereas CaMI and PMA were shown to mediate pro-TGF-\u03b1 shedding through two distinctive signal transduction mechanisms (34, 35). We previously reported that the ectodomain shedding of ACE2 was stimulated by PMA, which could be inhibited using both ADAM17-specific inhibitors and small interfering RNA technology (8). These results suggest that ADAM17 is involved in the regulated, but not constitutive, shedding of ACE2 (8). Although the sheddase(s) involved in ACE2 shedding regulated by CaMi is not known, we propose that the mechanism of activation for ACE2 ectodomain shedding by CaMi differs from that affected by phorbol ester. Our findings demonstrated that CaMi-induced shedding were unaffected by the inhibition of PKC pathway.",

Wang Abdel-Rahman (38) demonstrated that, although the level of CaM remained unchanged in the diseased liver, the binding of CaM to eNOS significantly decreased. Similarly, in one of our recent studies (39), we reported that ACE2 expression is significantly up-regulated in human and rat liver after chronic liver injury. Although the direct association of CaM and ACE2 in the liver has yet to be investigated, it is possible that, like eNOS, CaM binding to the overexpressed ACE2 may be reduced in the liver, ultimately leading to an increase in ACE2 secretion. In diseased tissues such as the heart and liver, an increase in secreted ACE2 could counteract the effect of increased Ang II production caused by other overexpressed components in the renin-angiotensin system (40, 41).",

The ectodomain shedding of ACE2 is potentially an important mechanism by which local ACE2 activity can be regulated. In addition, the shedding of ACE2 may represent a mechanism by which viral entry and infection may be controlled (e.g. SARS-CoV). Our studies demonstrate that CaM binds to a peptide mimetic of ACE2 cytoplasmic tail, and we show that CaMi- and PMA-induced shedding of ACE2 ectodomain occur via two independent mechanisms by which the ACE2 sheddase(s) may be activated. This finding provides valuable information about ACE2 shedding as well as identifying potential intracellular targets for the pharmacological and therapeutic regulation of ACE2.",
