            "text": "The current pandemic potentially lethal novel coronavirus (named SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19), caused major impact to millions of peoples health and global economy [1] (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov). To date, more than 126,212 deaths and nearly two million confirmed positive cases have been reported globally, making SARS-CoV-2 a urgent public health concern. Along the side of using using neutralizing antibodies targeting spike glycoproteins, which is involved in host cell adhesion [2], several antiviral drugs and drugs such as Hydroxychloroquine are also being evaluated for repurpose as possible treatments for SARS-CoV-2 [3]. The different classes of antivirals under evaluation include 3CL protein inhibitors (Ribavirin, Lopinavir/Ritonavir), RNA synthesis inhibitors (Remdesivir, Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate/TDF and 3TC), neuraminidase inhibitors (Tamiflu and Peramivir) [4] and other small molecule drugs which target the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to interact with host cells (ACE2 inhibitors) [3,5]. However, the potential drug target and mechanism of several candidate drugs remains elusive and warrants further structural and biophysical studies to unravel how these potential antiviral drugs bind and impact on SARS-CoV-2. Among the above clinically advancing several random drugs trails against SARS-CoV-2, Arbidol (Umifenovir) (Fig. 1\nA) is also been screening against SARS-CoV-2 [6]. However, the drug target of viral protein and the mechanism of action of Arbidol over SARS-CoV-2 is elusive, which is essential to understand drug action mechanism to develop better therapeutics. Considering the current public health crisis, we aimed to unravel the potential drug target, molecular interactions and address the mechanism of action of Arbidol on SARS-CoV-2.",

            "text": "Foremost, it was interesting for us to know that Arbidol is the known drug for influenza [1,7] that's binds Haemagglutinin (HA) protein. This raises an intriguing question that are there any sequence or structural similarities between SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and influenza virus (H3N2) HA protein, which could have resulted in the positive drug effect. The comparative protein sequence analysis shows that a short region of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein trimerization domain (S2) (aa947 \u2013 aa1027) resembles to that of H3N2 HA (Fig. S1A). The outer membrane spike glycosylation protein of SARS-CoV-2 is essential for host cell adhesion via human ACE2 and CD26 receptors [2,8] and its trimerization is imperative for host membrane fusion. This raises the intriguing question whether the Arbidol could also bind similar way to that of HA in SARS-COV-2 spike glycoprotein. Finding the potential Arbidol antiviral drug binding target and structural studies to unravel the mechanism of interaction has great implications and essential at the current global public health emergency which could open the arena in developing new potential therapeutics.",

Both servers predictions were consistent and provide six possible positions where a Arbidol could potentially interact with the spike glycoprotein (Fig. S1B and S1C). Among the obtained six clusters of Arbidol binding sites, we notice a single false positive (C1), a single true site (C2) and four unimportant/surface binding regions (C3-6) clusters, which is assessed and corroborated based on the Solvent accessibility surface area (SASA), C-Score (confidence score) and Z- score (clash score) of binding location and exposed residues of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. Further refinement was completed using Coot (www.mrc-imb.cam.uk/) to ensure appropriate docking and no clashes in the side chain residues. Binding free energies were taken into consideration for selecting the best possible docked site. The final model with Aribidol docked in the homotrimer structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (Fig. 1B) was visualised in PyMol.",

            "text": "To unravel the Arbidol binding mode and mechanism of action, we first looked at the most possible amino acid residues of spike glycoprotein involved in establishing the interaction with Arbidol. We found that K776, E780, K947, E1017, R1019, S1021, N1023, L1024, T1027 of the S2 trimerization domain makes interaction with Arbidol either via Van der Waals forces or hydrogen bonding (Fig. 1D and Fig. S1E). Specifically, Arbidol is sandwiched between the trimerization helices of two protomers K776, R1019, N1023, L1024, T1027 (Chain A) and E780, K947, E1017, S1021, L1024 (Chain B) (Fig. 1C and 1D). Where the total buried interface of \u223c900\u00c52 for three Arbidol binding regions (\u223c300\u00c52/Arbidol), as calculated from the PISA server (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/pisa/). We next looked at how Arbidol interacts in H3N2 HA protein (PDB: 5T6N) [7]. Interestingly, we noticed that Arbidol interaction in influenza HA protein is also mediated via Arg, Lys, Leu and Glu as the key interacting residues (R54, E57, K58, L90, E97, L98, L99) (Fig. 1E and 1F). Furthermore, the Arbidol is sandwiched between the two trimerization helices of two protomers (Chain A and B, Fig. 1F). Furthermore, we found that the position of H3N2 HA binding residues E57, R54, E97, L98, L99, K307, T59, K58 were similar with that of SARS-COV-2 spike glycoprotein residues K776, & 780, E1017, R1019, L1024, Y1027. Furthermore, to compare the exact structural similarities between the SARS-CoV-2 and H3N2 trimerization domains involved in Abridol binding, we superimposed the Arbidol binding regions of SARS-CoV-2 and H3N2, which superimposes with RMSD 0.82\u00c5 for C\u03b1 atoms. This also suggests possible structural similarities in the drug binding region of spike glycoprotein in influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2, which accentuates how an influenza virus drug could be a potential drug for SARS-CoV-2 infections.",

Based on the molecular dynamics and structural studies corroborate that spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 is the drug target for the Arbidol. This incites the drug binding mode with its key interacting residues and its mechanism where Arbidol can effectively block or impede the trimerization of spike glycoprotein, which is essential for cell adherence and entry [9]. Blocking the trimerization of spike glycoprotein also leads in the formation of naked or unmatured virus which are least infectious. Although this study has significant implications repurposing and knowing the drug target and in understanding the mechanism of viral inhibition, the efficacy and safety of Arbidol against SARS-CoV-2 still requires clinical investigation. As current drug options are more focused on inhibitors for ACE2 and viral RNA polymerase, potential drugs to impede the viral spike protein trimerization is also equally essential as the combination of drugs have a profound effect in combating the viral infection. This study also accenture in the development of new therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2 based on Arbidol using structure-guided drug designing.",
