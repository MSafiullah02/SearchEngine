However, many former sceptics of the contribution of health care now accept that, even after allowing for diet and lifestyle, health care does make a difference for specific conditions, such as cardiovascular disease (Wallace, 2004). Moreover, medical care also enhances the quality of life through pain relief and increased mobility.",

In the UK, such pressures result in poor health outcomes for some diseases (such as cancer), poor service quality, including long waiting lists and waiting times for certain treatments, and inequities in access and health outcomes. These impose significant costs on society above those of health provision itself. Health care costs themselves are bound to rise given an ageing population and advances in medical technology.",

While each of these strands of CGE literature has its own merits, most do not assess the endogenous impact of changes in health care provision on population health, and on the labour force in particular and its impact on production, income and welfare.1\n",

The CGE model is calibrated to a purpose-built Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) for the UK for the year 2000 with considerable refinement in terms of sectors (distinguishing health care and its main input suppliers), factors (capital, skilled and unskilled labour) and household types (based on the age and labour market participation of household members). It is the first of its kind in that it has been designed to analyse the macro-economic impacts of changes in health care provision, while recognising the simultaneous effects of changes in health on effective labour supplies and the resource claims made by the health sector. The effects on welfare of higher health provision come through two main channels: (a) the direct gain from increasing the \u201cwell-being\u201d of the population, and (b) the indirect effects of an increase in the size of the effective (i.e., \u201cable to work\u201d) endowments of skilled and unskilled labour for use in non-health activities.",

Splitting the changes into the two components allows us to draw some insights from standard trade theory results that have their origin in the seminal paper by Rybczynski (1955). Since the health sector is, in this example, the most skill-intensive sector, its expansion will lead to a reduction in the skilled-unskilled labour endowment ratio available to the rest of the economy, so that, on the basis of the Rybczynski theorem, the output of the relatively skill-intensive good (sector 1) will fall and the output of the other good (sector 2) will rise. This is the factor-bias effect, depicted in Fig. 2 by the move from A to B. The scale effect, from B to C, shows the effect of reducing the amounts of skilled and unskilled labour on the waiting lists, i.e., increasing effective labour supplies, which in this example increases the production of both goods.5\n",

For developed countries the available evidence suggests that the elasticity of effective labour supplies with respect to health care is small (and less than one) so that scale effects are small, as in Fig. 2.

Typically, the higher the wage and the higher the level of responsibility involved in the job, the lower the absence from work.

This suggests that, following a rise in the NHS budget and the consequent expansion of the health sector, the increased demand for intermediate inputs from this sector outweighs the reduced availability of skilled labour relative to unskilled labour. Also, most of the unskilled-intensive sectors contract, apart from construction and the medical instruments sector.

Given that effective labour supplies are relatively inelastic with respect to health care provision in developed countries since they are \u201con the flat of the health production curve\u201d, factor-bias effects may dominate so that an increase in health care provision, which is relatively skill-intensive, may \u201con average\u201d result in an expansion of the relatively unskilled-intensive sectors and a contraction of the relatively skill-intensive sectors in the long-term.

The main findings are that the increase in the NHS budget, while drawing away resources from its private counterpart and from other non-health related sectors, leads to an overall welfare gain through increased worker incomes and, more importantly, direct increases in population well-being. The presence of health care-specific skilled labour and capital reduces the overall welfare gain by about two thirds, as over half of the specified budget rise is absorbed by higher wages and rents. This suggests the importance of tackling short-term rigidities in the health sector. The shortage of highly skilled workers may in the short-term be addressed via the recruitment of highly skilled foreign doctors and nurses. This policy was found to yield the highest overall welfare gains, even if all foreign worker income is remitted abroad, since government transfers need to fall by less to finance the health care budget increase due to higher government tax revenues. It is, however, unlikely to be a desirable policy given that many migrant workers come from developing countries which need their own educated staff.
