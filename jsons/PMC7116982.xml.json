Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems play a vital role in ensuring the indoor air quality inside such environments. Outbreaks of severe infectious diseases, from severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003 to avian influenza and Middle East respiratory syndrome in recent years, indicate the importance of effective disinfection in ventilation systems to prevent extensive infections inside a building [2], [3]. Ductwork systems provide a breeding ground for the potential reproduction and transmission of microorganisms [4]. Such microorganisms can survive and propagate throughout the entire building through sophisticated, interconnected ventilation duct systems, which may be lead to cross-infection of the occupants.",

An alternative method using air ionizers for disinfection was developed in recent years. Park et al. [6] demonstrated the feasibility of the air ion disinfection approach for the reduction of aerosol particles in HVAC systems and found that this approach can be used to control IAQ. They showed that it is feasible to remove bioaerosols with a low-efficiency HVAC filter enhanced by continuous emission of unipolar air ions. Lee et al. [7], [8], [9] conducted similar experiments to determine the disinfection performance of air ions against aerosolized bacteria. Unipolar and bipolar ionizers were installed in a duct flow to evaluate the disinfection efficacy with different numbers of ionizers and the polarity effect.",

However, none of these studies modeled the disinfection of bacteria. In Ref.

The inactivation of negative ions on bacteria performed better at lower inlet velocities. The highest effectiveness for bacteria removal was 16% for S. epidermidis and 30% for S. marcescens when the inlet velocity was 3.0 m/s. The disinfection efficiency decreased when the inlet velocity increased. For S. epidermidis, the disinfection efficiency gradually decreased to 9.5% and 7.7% when the inlet velocity was 5.0 m/s and 6.0 m/s, respectively. For S. marcescens, the disinfection effectiveness decreased to 17.1% at 4.0 m/s and 6.5 m/s. As the velocity increased, the dose (ion level multiplied by exposure time) received by the bacteria decreased, which reduced the disinfection efficiency.",

(9)), as shown in Fig. 7\n. Compared to removal by disinfection, the effect of gravitational settling and wall deposition was only 0.02%, and thus these two effects could be ignored because the selected bacteria were only 1 \u03bcm in size. The measured disinfection efficiency depends on the constant susceptibility Z and the number of negative ions. The disinfection efficiency against S. marcescens was higher than that of S. epidermidis. The bacteria concentration was nearly zero downstream very close to the ionizer for two reasons: first, the bacteria distribution at the back of the ionizer was relatively low due to the effect of fluid flow around the cylindrical tube; and second, the largest number of negative ions occurred here, resulting in a distribution of bacteria near zero because the disinfection efficacy was assumed to increase linearly with negative ion concentration (when the velocity is the same). The disinfection efficiency decreased at distances far away from the ionizer because the number of negative ions decreased. The predicted concentration of bacteria (facet average at the sampling cut-plane) was 32.8% and 12.7% for S. epidermidis and S. marcescens, respectively, as compared to the experimental results, as shown in Table 2\n.",
