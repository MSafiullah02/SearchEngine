They also suggest that so-called false alarms for tornadoes in the USA do not make people less likely to respond to tornado warnings in the future; that is, their evidence is that the \u2018Crying Wolf\u2019 syndrome is not usually a concern. In contrast, Simmons and Sutter (2009) found that a higher, recent false alarm rate for tornadoes in the USA significantly increases casualties from tornadoes in that area, suggesting that so-called false alarms for tornadoes do make people less inclined to react to subsequent warnings. The discrepancy could be a result of people\u2019s expectations in terms of an EWS\u2019 structure and function not being communicated properly, leading to expectations which cannot be fully met. As such, no specific or universal answers can be given regarding what \u2018failure\u2019 means for an EWS.",

Yet places such as Thailand and Sri Lanka did not evacuate coastal areas despite having hours of warning lead time before the tsunami struck. The reasons are complicated, but focus on the fact that, long before the earthquake and tsunami, an international tsunami warning system had been assumed to stop and to be successful with the issuing of information to authorities soon after an earthquake, so the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center had no mandate, resources, assistance, support, or expertise to go further (Kelman 2006). Realising the horrendous danger, the staff nonetheless tried desperately to improvise, but as one example indicating why the message did not get through, phones were not answered due to the holiday season. As such, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center had a huge success, but the EWS system overall\u2014which goes far beyond the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center and the authorities with whom they communicate\u2014undoubtedly failed miserably, leading to a horrendous death toll.",

Instead, the people who are affected by hazards, who have the vulnerabilities, and who are served by the EWS should be involved as the central component and should be involved from the beginning of the EWS design and operation. This approach is termed \u2018The First Mile\u2019 (e.g. Loster 2012).

Six Italian scientists and an Italian civil servant were tried for manslaughter for the warning information that they disseminated just prior to the main shock. They were convicted in October 2012, although appeals are likely. Much of the media reported the story as finding the defendants guilty for failing to predict and warn about the specific timing and location of the earthquake, a task which is currently impossible. Alexander (2013, p. 9) provides a different view, stating that:\nScience and scientists were not on trial. The hypothesis of culpability being tested in the courts referred to the failure to adopt a precautionary approach in the face of clear indications of impending seismic impact, not failure to predict an earthquake, and this is amply documented in official records.\n",

The key is not to rely on medium warning or late warning. Otherwise, it might be impossible to take the action needed, as with the 1998 tsunami in Papua New Guinea. Instead, it is about embedding warning systems within society and using different mechanisms, approaches, and information in parallel to support the pursuit of needed actions.",

It reinforces a top-down operating perspective, by implying that an expert forecaster can produce a forecast and then hand it down (figuratively and literally) to a community eagerly awaiting the hazard information so that they can do exactly what they are told in response.
