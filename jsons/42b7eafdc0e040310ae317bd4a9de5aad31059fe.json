Body mass index, from measured height and weight, was used as an indicator of overall obesity. Outcome was cases of COVID-19 serious enough to warrant a hospital admission from 16-March-2020 to 26-April-2020. There were 760 COVID-19 cases. After adjustment for age, sex and mutually for each lifestyle factor, physical inactivity (Relative risk, 1.32, 95% confidence interval, 1.10, 1.58), smoking (1.42;1.12, 1.79) and obesity (2.05 ;1.68, 2.49) but not heavy alcohol consumption (1.12; 0.93, 1.35) were all related to COVID-19. We also found a dose-dependent increase in risk of COVID-19 with less favourable lifestyle scores, such that participants in the most adverse category had 4-fold higher risk (4.41; 2.52 -7.71) compared to people with the most optimal lifestyle. C-reactive protein levels were associated with elevated risk of COVID-19 in a dose-dependent manner, and partly (10 -16%) explained associations between adverse lifestyle and COVID-19. Based on UK risk factor prevalence estimates, unhealthy behaviours in combination accounted for up to 51% of the population attributable fraction of severe COVID-19. Our findings suggest that an unhealthy lifestyle synonymous with an elevated risk of noncommunicable disease is also a risk factor for COVID-19 hospital admission, which might be partly explained by low grade inflammation. Adopting simple lifestyle changes could lower the risk of severe infection.",

Data on high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), measured at baseline at least 10 years before possible infection, 16 were available in a sub-sample of participants (n=363,263). We observed an association between adverse lifestyle score and higher hsCRP levels (B= 0.10, 95% CI, 0.09, 0.11) after adjustment for age, sex, education, ethnicity, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease. hsCRP levels were associated with elevated risk of COVID-19 in a dose-dependent manner (Table 3) . When the association between lifestyle score and COVID-19 was adjusted for hsCRP, the effect estimates were attenuated by 10 -16 % suggesting a possible mediating effect (Table 3 ).",

[5] [6] [7] [8] [9] Other studies 17-20 in athletic populations have described a \"J\" shaped association between exercise volume and infection with optimal protection at moderate levels of activity. In the present study, protective associations of physical activity on COVID-19 were observed even at relatively low levels of activity below the current guidelines (i.e., < 150 min moderate to vigorous activity) and no dose-response effect was observed for higher levels. There are plausible biological mechanisms explaining the immunological benefits of exercise, 17 for example, antiinflammatory effects and beneficial effects on adaptive immune responses. 21 The existing evidence on obesity and infection have been mixed. Some data suggested BMI above 25 kg.m -2 was protective against pneumonia mortality 7,8 whilst others have suggested that overweight and obesity was associated with higher risk of respiratory and skin infections whilst protective against viral and fungal infections. 22 In a large Norwegian cohort, overweight and obesity were associated with higher 30 day mortality risk after detection of blood borne bacterial infection. 9 Our results suggested both overweight and obesity were risk factors for severe COVID-19 infection, consistent with emerging data in small clinical studies. 23 The potential mechanisms have been linked to immune hyper-reactivity, impaired metabolic responses, and the adverse effects of obesity on lung function, diminishing forced expiratory volume and forced vital capacity. 23 We found only weak evidence for a link between excessive alcohol intake and COVID-19, which was attenuated to the null in models mutually adjusted for other behavioral risk factors. This is largely consistent with our previous work on alcohol and infectious disease mortality. 8 Interestingly, 'none drinkers' were at greater risk of COVID-19, which is likely non-causal as this group have often stopped drinking due to prescribed medication and underlying health conditions.",
