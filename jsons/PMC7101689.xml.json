            "text": "Ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) is one of the major causes of hospital acquired infections. Despite improvements in aseptic techniques, antibiotic therapy, and supportive care, VAP continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality of ICU patients. The incidence continues to be high in spite of improved understanding of the risk factors of VAP. There is no consensus on the preventive strategies akin to adults, in form of bundle approach in children. In 2004, the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance (NNIS) system of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported a mean VAP rate of 2.9 per 1000 ventilator days for participating PICUs in the United States [1], while pediatric studies across the globe report an incidence of 2\u201317% [2\u20135]. There are very few studies from developing countries including India reporting the incidence of VAP in chidren. One study from North India reported incidence of VAP to be between 17 and 30% [6]. The risk factors for VAP in infants and children vary somewhat from those in adults. Inoculation of the formerly sterile lower respiratory tract typically occurs from aspiration of secretions, colonization of the aero-digestive tract, use of contaminated equipment, medications, presence of a genetic syndrome, re-intubation, enteral feeding, transport out of the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and duration of mechanical ventilation [7]. Common etiological agents causing VAP are Pseudomonas spp., Staphylococcus aureus, and various Gram negative bacilli. The proportion of these organisms varies between the PICUs [6, 8].",

Tracheal aspirate and non-bronchoscopic BAL samples were sent to Bacteriology laboratory of the institute for culture. Culture reports along with antibiotic sensitivity pattern of the isolates were obtained. Non-bronchoscopic BAL were subjected to semi-quantitative culture and culture reports with >104 colony forming units/ mL were considered significant [9]. A diagnosis of VAP was made if there was presence of radiological changes (new infiltrates/ consolidation/ cavity) along with a positive non-bronchoscopic BAL semi-quantitative culture report. Cases with a positive non-bronchoscopic BAL semi-quantitative culture only in the absence of radiological changes of VAP were diagnosed to have ventilator associated tracheobronchitis (VAT). Simplified Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS) (Table 1) was computed daily for the enrolled patients. This consisted of components such as temperature, blood leukocyte count, tracheal secretions, PaO2/ FiO2 ratio and chest radiograph findings.",

Incidence rate reported from developed countries has been in the range of 15\u201317% [2\u20135], while in developing countries it is 25\u201335% [7]. Srinivasan et al. from Boston had reported an incidence of 32% using CDC defined VAP in pediatric patients [10]. Elward et al. in their study from Missouri revealed a VAP rate of 11.6 episodes per 1000 ventilator days [2]. While, the present study has documented incidence rate to be 41 episodes per 1000 ventilator days. This is probably due to differences in the patient profile, nutritional status and resource availability. The present study results are similar to another Indian study done by Awasthi et al. where the incidence of VAP was reported to be 36.2% [11]. The inclusion criteria and the definition used in this study were the same as in present study. Comparison of incidence from various studies should be done with caution, taking into account the profile of patients being studied and also the criteria used for diagnosis. High incidence of VAP has been reported for many a decades and it remains almost the same. Study by Gupta et al. from Delhi, India, showed a decrease of VAP incidence from 20.2 to 14.6 episodes per 1000 ventilator days after an educational intervention [12].",

This was based on CDC definition of clinical and radiological features. Endotracheal aspirate (ETA) was negative for organisms in all those suspected of VAT. The European Respiratory Society, European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, and European Society of Intensive Care Medicine taskforce suggest a positive culture of respiratory secretions as a mandatory item in the diagnosis of VAT. Though CDC definition for VAT requires only one of the clinical criteria to be fulfilled, the documentation of 11.62% was done in the presence of purulent secretion as a mandatory criteria to avoid confusions in case of ETA being sterile. Hence, this clinical definition could well be adopted for VAT though ETA positivity is useful for making decision about treating VAT. Craven et al. reported the incidence of VAT to be 11% in adults [13], though they used microbiological confirmation to be mandatory in the diagnosis of ventilator associated tracheobronchitis. Simpson et al. reported a much lower (3.4%) incidence of VAT in a mixed medical surgical PICU [14].",

Various studies have shown varying results of male and female predisposition for the same. But this could probably be due to the difference in the rates of admission and enrolment. Study by Patria et al. had shown similar results with enteral feeding and re-intubation as independent risk factors for VAP [16]. Children enroled in present study received proton pump inhibitor \u2013 pantoprazole as the stress ulcer prophylaxis during their PICU stay. This clinically correlates to the possibility of micro-aspiration in an alkaline environment leading to VAP. Gopalareddy et al. used ETA for the presence of pepsin and have shown that 70% of mechanically ventilated children are prone for gastric aspiration [18]. The risk of VAP was greatly increased in patients who underwent re-intubation. A similar high incidence of VAP was found to be associated with re-intubation in other studies as well [19]. Possible explanations could be increase in duration of ventilation and aspiration of gastric contents during the interval between extubation and re-intubation. This underlines the importance of proper weaning protocols in the prevention of VAP and the associated mortality.",

Sachdev et al. found a value of 8 to be sensitive and specific and they used microbiological positivity as the gold standard [20], but no other pediatric studies have validated the same. The greater difference in the cut-off value between the study by Sachdev et al. and present study could be explained by the fact that their study included children with a CPIS score of more than 6.
