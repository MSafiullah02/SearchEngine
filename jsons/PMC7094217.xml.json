            "text": "Interest in heterocyclic aromatic N-oxides has flourished because of their practical impact on biological activity [1]. A number of N-oxide derivatives are known to show herbicidal activity [2], inhibitory activity [3] such as against feline coronavirus and human SARS-CoV, as well as antibiotic properties, as for example 2-n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide [4], [5]. This latter N-oxide is also known for mediating proton transfer across the mitochondrial membrane as well as for inhibiting electron transport across cell membranes in complex form [4], [6]. Moreover, researchers have reported several aromatic N-oxide derivatives capable of forming biologically active metal complexes [7], [8]. Apart from these, coordination complexes of aromatic N-oxides are known to have extensive applications as magnetic materials [7], [9], [10], [11], [12], in catalysis [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19] as well as in supramolecular systems [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31].",

Thus, by use of bidentate spacer ligands to connect these paddle wheel units the distance of separation between the paddle wheel cores may be controlled. As shown in Scheme 2\nsuch distance will be different for different ligands used (d1 > d2), which in turn may have significant effects on their magnetic exchange properties. However, in the case of 2,2\u2032-bipyridyl-N,N\u2032-dioxide there is other possibilities such as chelation, which need to be overcome so that polymeric structures are preferred. With the intention of studying magnetostructural correlations with some copper(II) complexes of such polymeric complexes we have synthesized a number of coordination complexes/polymers of copper(II) aromatic N-oxides having carboxylate as the anionic ligand and studied their magnetic properties as a function of temperature. We have studied complexes of N-oxide ligands such as pyridine N-oxide, 2,2\u2032-bipyridyl-N,N\u2032-dioxide, 4,4\u2032-bipyridyl-N,N\u2032-dioxide and nicotinic acid N-oxide to compare the structural as well as magnetic features of the different complexes formed. All the complexes reported here are characterized by conventional spectroscopic techniques as well as with single-crystal X-ray diffraction.",

Two of the coordination come from two benzoate ligands, two from the 4,4\u2032-bipyridyl-N,N\u2032-dioxide and the rest from the aquo-ligand. The oxygen O7 from 4,4\u2032-bipyridyl-N,N\u2032-dioxide occupies the apical position with a Cu\u2013O bond distance of 2.527 \u00c5. Here, the distance between two nearest copper(II) centres bridged by 4,4\u2032-bipyridyl-N,N\u2032-dioxide is 12.007 \u00c5. The one-dimensional chains interact through the hydrogen bonds O6\u2013H6A\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O2 and O6\u2013H6B\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O4 between aquo-groups and the carboxylate oxygen and O8\u2013H8\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O7, between the hydroxy group on the aromatic carboxylate ring and one of the N-oxo groups. The hydrogen bonded self assembly is shown in the Fig. 4b along with the coordination environment around Cu1 in Fig. 4a.",

However the magnetic measurement for 5 is carried out and discussed in the next section. It should be noted that the structure contains as many as four water molecules per copper core. These water molecules are strongly hydrogen bonded to each other forming net-like structures of hexameric aqua-units as shown in Fig. 5\na. These aqua-nets surround the one-dimensional chain of the metal complex separating them from each other as shown in Fig. 5b. This makes a layered structure comprising of polymeric chains of the metal complex embedding a layered sheets of infinite chains like structures of water.",
