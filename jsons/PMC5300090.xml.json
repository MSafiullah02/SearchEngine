Viral glycoproteins in general have been difficult to study with the exception of influenza hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, which were isolated by cleavage from the virus surface over 40 years ago using proteases,1, 2, 3 thereby enabling low\u2010resolution views first by electron microscopy4, 5 and then high\u2010resolution structures by X\u2010ray crystallography.6, 7 However, for other viral glycoproteins, development of recombinant expression systems, as well as stabilized soluble versions of the glycoproteins, were essential for successful structure determination. Even for influenza hemagglutinin, a robust recombinant expression system that could provide sufficient quantities for structural studies was not developed until 2004.8\n",

It became clear that binding of CD4 induced changes in the trimer and was much more open at the trimer apex after CD4 and Fab 17b (a CD4i antibody) were bound to the CD4 binding site (CD4bs).40 The flexible nature of the trimers thus became apparent from this early cryo\u2010ET work and further studies by cryo\u2010EM revealed multiple conformations of the Env trimer that were related to the conformational rearrangements that the trimer must undergo to attain its fusion\u2010active form after receptor binding41 as well as a structure of the prefusion form.42 Importantly, some antibodies were shown to stabilize the prefusion, closed form of the trimer.41\n",

In our own lab, we tried to crystallize the original clade B JR\u2010FL SOSIP trimer in collaboration with John Moore and Rogier Sanders starting in 2002. It was not until much later that we found out why that did not work (see below). A change of the Env sequence to a clade A KNH1144 strain in complex with Fab 17b led to Rob Pejchal in the Wilson lab obtaining beautiful crystals with excellent morphology that indeed diffracted x\u2010rays, but only to 17 \u00c5 resolution. It became clear that aggregation of the trimer was a problem with this construct and, after considerable experimentation, truncation of the hydrophobic MPER at residue 664 instead of at residue 681 in the original construct substantially improved the biophysical properties and eliminated the micelle around the gp41 base as clearly visualized by negative\u2010stain EM.43, 44 The resulting crystals from this material now diffracted to 7.7 \u00c5 in complex with a different Fab, PGT123, which interacts with the high mannose patch centered around glycan N332. To further improve Env properties, SOSIP constructs were made for many different strains. Electron microscopy led to a critical advance here as, of all the constructs screened, a clade A BG505 SOSIP trimer looked the best in negative\u2010stain EM in terms of trimers that were compact, properly folded, and emulated trimers on the surface of the virus.45 Thus, this BG505 trimer was selected for further immunological and structural studies and was found to be very stable with a melting temperature (Tm) of 68.1\u00b0C, bound all known broadly neutralizing antibodies (except MPER Abs as MPER was not present in the construct), and was highly homogeneous and folded into a native\u2010like structure as evaluated quantitatively by negative\u2013stain EM.46 The importance of cleavage between gp120 and gp41 for attaining a native conformation was also demonstrated to be critical.47\n",

Broadly neutralizing antibodies were also to play a crucial role in the structure determination, both by X\u2010ray crystallography and by cryo\u2010electron microscopy. Until 2008, only a handful of bnAbs were available to facilitate crystallization of the highly glycosylated trimer, but significant advances in methods for isolating human monoclonal antibodies against HIV [reviewed 48] either by direct neutralization screening of single B cell cultures49, 50 or from antigen\u2010specific B cell sorting51, 52 provided a rich and plentiful assortment for structural and functional studies. Indeed, the recombinant BG505 SOSIP trimer itself was later used to select for some of the most potent antibodies to date against the Env trimer.53, 54 As a result, many antibodies became available to aid in crystallization of the Env trimer. However, heterogeneity of the glycosylation on Env was still a problem until partial deglycosylation of the antibody\u2010SOSIP trimer complexes using EndoH was able to create more homogeneous specimens,14 as we used previously for Fab PGT135/gp120 complexes.55 Diffraction\u2010quality crystals were then obtained by Jean\u2010Philippe Julien in the Wilson lab after making a myriad of complexes of the BG505 SOSIP Env with 50 different Fabs, deglycosylating, then setting up over 100 000 crystallization trials, and screening >1000 crystals to find a crystal that diffracted sufficiently well to determine the Env structure. Thus, after more than 10 years from the first attempts to crystallize the JR\u2010FL SOSIP trimer, suitable crystals were obtained for the BG505 SOSIP trimer.",

            "text": "But that was not the end of the story\u2010 far from it. The Ward lab had been using EM to select and characterize suitable Env trimers for structural study.43, 45 However, while these EM studies were initially intended to aid the Env structural work by x\u2010ray, major advances in cryo\u2010EM suggested the possibility of now determining structures from single particles at sub\u2010nanometer resolution.56 To facilitate the detection and alignment of the Env particles, CD4bs antibody PGV04 was complexed with the soluble BG505 SOSIP trimer and, after considerable effort to overcome sample aggregation and preferred orientations, a cryo\u2010EM structure was determined by Dmitry Lyumkis in the Ward lab at approximately 5.8 \u00c5 resolution. Furthermore, the low resolution EM envelope of BG505 bound to PGT122 was crucial for the molecular replacement solution of the X\u2010ray structure.14 Thus, EM not only caught up, but in a sense surpassed X\u2010ray to achieve the structure of this challenging glycoprotein as the first views at high resolution came from cryo\u2010EM. Also, as no crystallization was required, all of the native glycans could be left on the Env protein enabling visualization of a more native\u2010like and complete glycan shield in addition to the protein components. The resulting structures of BG505 SOSIP by cryo\u2010EM in complex with PGV04 (CD4bs)13 and x\u2010ray in complex with PGT122 (high mannose N332 glycan patch)14 at 5.8 \u00c5 and 4.7 \u00c5 resolution, respectively, provided the first atomic\u2010level views of a soluble Env trimer. These structures disclosed the intimate association of the gp120 and gp41 components, the prefusion helical structure of gp41 with its central triple coiled\u2010coil HR1 helices and the close interaction of the hypervariable V2 and V3 loops around the Env trimer apex (Figures 1 and 2). Furthermore, broadly neutralizing epitopes for the CD4 binding site and the high mannose N332 patch were visualized in the context of the trimer, illustrating why it was so difficult to raise bnAbs from individual components of the trimer, such as gp120, because antibodies can approach gp120 in ways that are not permitted in a trimer context (i.e. non\u2010neutralizing antibodies are usually generated using gp120 or malformed trimers as an immunogen57). Both EM and X\u2010ray structures highly complemented each other and laid the foundation for understanding the intrinsic beauty and sheer complexity of the Env trimer structure and then for how to design other versions of soluble trimers from different strains and subtypes.58\n",

Peter Kwong and colleagues utilized the same BG505 SOSIP construct and further experimented with mixing and matching antibodies. The original PGT122 Fab provided good lattice contacts with the BG505 Env trimer, but the resolution and anisotropy of the diffraction was not ideal. Addition of a newly discovered antibody 35O22 from Mark Connors laboratory led to crystals that increased the resolution to approximately 3.5 \u00c5, although still with considerable anisotropy.59 This more complete structure of the Env trimer revealed fascinating new details of the prefusion gp41 conformation including the SOS disulfide, the intricate arrangement of the N\u2010 and C\u2010 terminal regions of gp120 with gp41 at the base of the trimer, and a tryptophan clasp that locked the fusion peptide proximal region in its prefusion conformation (Figures 1 and 2).",

Combination of different antibodies led to various structures of BG505 SOSIP with PGT122 and Fab NIH45\u20104660 at 4.4 \u00c5, with PGT128 plus 8ANC195 at 4.6 \u00c5,61 with 8ANC195 at 3.6 \u00c5,62 and finally with Fabs 3H+109L (a putative heavy chain precursor of the PGT121 lineage) and 35022 to achieve 3.0 \u00c5 resolution where fully isotropic diffraction was observed from these crystals.63 This latter structure completed the description of gp41, including the largely disordered region around the top of the central HR1 helices (HR1N) that connect to the fusion peptide proximal region (FPPR) and which contains the I559P mutation that stabilizes the prefusion conformation of the SOSIP trimer. Notwithstanding, this region is still very flexible in the soluble trimers but is less so in native, almost full\u2010length trimers as discussed below. In practice, this flexible region has also become a target for engineering alternate trimers, also discussed below. Furthermore, these new structures with potential precursors and intermediates of the heavy chain of the highly potent PGT121 lineage have provided valuable information on the evolution of different branches of an antibody lineage and how alternate solutions can arise even starting from a single unmutated common ancestor.63, 64\n",

The 80\u201090 glycans that cover the surface of the HIV\u20101 Envelope protein (Env) are put on and processed by our own cells in the journey of the Env glycoprotein from the endoplasmic reticulum through the Golgi to the cell surface and then into the virion itself. These self\u2010glycans should protect the virus against an immune response through tolerance mechanisms, but the virus has gone overboard in almost completely covering the Env surface making it unlike any glycoprotein on the surface of our own cells or even on most other viral glycoproteins (Figure 4). So the burning questions that percolated for several years were: what does the glycan shield look like, what is its exact composition, and what is its three\u2010dimensional structure. Hints came from x\u2010ray structures of the high mannose patch targeting PGT128 bound to a minimal gp120 outer domain construct65 and V1V2 targeting PG9 bound to a scaffolded V1V2 domain.66 Both structures demonstrated how antibodies used long CDRH3 loops to penetrate the glycan shield, albeit in a minimal monomeric context.",

This high density of glycans of the HIV\u20101 surface led to the notion of it being a protective coat against antibodies in the immune system. To circumvent some of the heterogeneity in the glycans for structural studies, the Env proteins were expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293S GnTI\u2212/\u2212 cells that produce high mannose glycans and no complex sugars. The glycans were then trimmed with the endoglycosidase EndoH\u2014glycans that are protected within the three\u2010dimensional structure or are proximal to the bound bnAbs are not cleaved by EndoH and can often be more readily visualized. The first X\u2010ray trimer structure showed an extensive assortment of glycans covering the surface [see figure 1 of 14] particularly around the high mannose patch and around the glycopeptide epitopes bound by the bnAbs. Further x\u2010ray structures of BG505 SOSIP with different antibodies have reinforced this view that the ordered glycans are either closely clustered on the surface or interact with bnAbs. Indeed, a glycan at position 262 is particularly well ordered as it is intimately involved with the folding of gp120 and also helps buttress other glycans on the surface of Env.61\n",

One major advantage of electron microscopy is that the sample protein does not have to be crystallized. Hence, heterogeneous glycosylation can be accommodated in EM structure determination. The cryo\u2010EM samples were therefore produced in HEK 293T cells with glycosylation profiles similar to that on the virus itself.

In the EM structure, the glycans are much more diverse and heterogeneous and would lead to fewer glycans being visualized as multiple glycoforms are present at many positions, especially those that mainly consist of complex and hybrid glycans.71 But, for the high mannose patch on gp120, which should be relatively homogeneous in both,71, 72, 73 fewer sugars and glycan interactions were seen in the EM structure. Natural glycan processing may to some extent account for this as it depends on the entire constellation of glycans surrounding each and every glycan\u2010 even the high mannose patch has complex or hybrid sugars interspersed between and surrounding the high mannose clusters that may make them more heterogeneous in the native versus high mannose glycoproteins. Completely homogenous high mannose sugars may also have a greater tendency to cluster and form defined interactions, but that has still to be verified. The x\u2010ray structures were also complexed with antibodies that interact with and help order glycans as noted in previous x\u2010ray14, 59, 63 and EM13 studies. In the x\u2010ray structures,67 two antibodies are bound to gp120 and one to gp41, whereas in the cryo\u2010EM structure,69 only one antibody PGT151 is bound asymmetrically (and only two per trimer) at the gp120/gp41 interface. Thus, nine antibodies are bound per trimer in the x\u2010ray structure and only two per trimer in the EM structure. Notably, the most ordered glycans in gp120 in the x\u2010ray structure, as well as the complex glycans in gp41 in the cryo\u2010EM structure, are proximal to where the antibodies are bound. A further x\u2010ray structure of BG505 SOSIP with three 8ANC195G52K5 Fabs bound per trimer also showed highly ordered high mannose glycans surrounding the bound antibody.62 Thus, it is now well\u2010appreciated that, when antibodies bind to their glycopeptide epitopes, they can help order the glycans that are part of or proximal to the epitopes. Finally, it might it possible that crystallization can select out more ordered glycoforms, or the crystallization buffer and low pH may artificially promote glycan\u2010glycan interaction.",

It has been known for some time that a high level of glycan homogeneity existed in a region known as the high mannose patch75, 76, 77 (Figure 4), due to steric crowding that impeded secondary processing from high mannose sugars to more complex glycoforms by glycosidases.73, 75 This secondary processing takes place in the golgi after the protein is fully folded and hence reflects either the capability or inability of glycosidases to access their glycan substrates on the Env protein [see figure 4 of 72]. Thus, the tightly crowded high mannose patch on the outer surface of gp120 is essentially independent of the cell line used for protein expression.73 In gp41, as the glycan sites are further apart (Figure 4), more complex or hybrid glycans predominate and the glycosylation then becomes cell\u2010line dependent due to the differential activities of glycosidases in different cell lines.73 Another important feature is that cleavage of the trimer is critical in attaining proper native\u2010like glycosylation\u2014uncleaved trimers have more processed glycoforms73 indicating that structure is not folded into the closed native conformation.47 Indeed, non\u2010native uncleaved gp120 proteins also contain aberrant disulfide bonds.78\n",

Two of these designs modify the cleavage site between gp120 and gp41 (Figure 3). One of these designs, termed native flexibly linked (NFL), replaces the natural cleavage sequence REKR with Gly4\u2010Ser linkers between the natural C\u2010 terminus of gp120 and N\u2010terminus of gp41,84 where two such repeats were optimal.

However, the I559P mutation that was necessary for stabilization of SOSIP trimers was also required here. This NFL platform has now been used to express Env proteins for other B and C subtypes by incorporating residues from BG505 that are important for trimer formation [called trimer\u2010derived residues (TD)].85 A similar design also experimented with inserting Gly\u2010Ser linkers in place of the cleavage sequence on a BG505 backbone where a linker of 15 residues gave optimal properties. This construct maintained the SOSIP mutations (SOS: A501C\u2010T605C and IP: I559P).86 Thus, these designs resulted in soluble Env trimers that did not need furin for cleavage to achieve native\u2010like conformations and, hence, could potentially simplify the expression of Env trimers.",

A combination of different factors contributed to these recent successes and included the critical development of a stable soluble trimer that was native\u2010like and amenable for high\u2010resolution structural studies.46 An equally important component for structure determination was the diverse assortment of human broadly neutralizing antibodies that became increasingly available after 2008.48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54 The Fabs from these antibodies could be exploited in a combinatorial manner using high\u2010throughput crystallization screens with Env trimers, and robotic systems [e.g. see 98] to improve the odds of forming a crystal lattice that minimized contacts with the heterogeneous glycosylation of the Env trimer and could produce crystals that diffract to high resolution. These antibodies were also not only important for crystallization, but also for providing appropriate mass and features for single particle cryo\u2010EM. Furthermore, these antibody complexes have elucidated the structure and features of the broadly neutralizing epitopes in the context of the trimer and accelerated the design of immunogens as vaccine candidates. The soluble Env trimers from the BG505 strain have provided the majority of the structures determined to date, but this SOSIP platform has turned out to be transferable to other strains and subtypes (Figures 1 and 2). These breakthroughs inspired the design of other platforms that capitalized on the stabilizing mutations that proved critical in the SOSIP constructs (Figure 3). While it became clear that uncleaved trimers did not fold into compact trimers,47 two groups explored replacing the cleavage site with a linker that would provide more flexibility and enable the uncleaved trimers to adopt a native\u2010like prefusion trimer configuration84, 85, 86 (Figure 3). The original I559P mutation that was essential to stabilize the SOSIP trimers is in a highly flexible loop that zips up into a helical structure in the postfusion form after receptor and co\u2010receptor binding. This proline mutation reduced the propensity for such a conformational change. In another design effort, this loop was assumed to be a major cause of the trimer metastability\u2010 thus, the HR1N loop was shortened and modified in sequence to prevent such a helical postfusion conformation and, when combined with addition of a flexible linker between gp120 and gp41, led to a platform that produced good yields of soluble trimers for a diverse array of strains and subtypes88 (Figure 3). Thus, within a short span of 2\u20133 years, new Env trimers were produced on different backbones with different platforms and with increased stability that clearly illustrated that such modifications did not perturb the conserved Env trimer fold and could accommodate the regions of sequence and structural hypervariability (Figures 1 and 2).",

The cryo\u2010EM structure of an almost full\u2010length JR\u2010FL native trimer with MPER and the transmembrane domain, but without the cytoplasmic domain, was determined69 and then compared to the soluble Env protein (Figures 1 and 2). While subtle differences were seen in the apex and in the FPPR, the overall fold was very similar for the native and soluble trimers that put to rest any lingering questions about differences in soluble versus native trimers. What the glycan shield looked like was also addressed in these studies (Figure 4) as well as site\u2010specific information on the composition of the glycoforms at individual glycosylation sites.71, 72, 73 Thus, we now have an excellent and graphic representation of the glycans covering and protecting the Env protein surface from these structural and functional analyses (Figure 4). The myriad of complexes with diverse antibodies has also uncovered a much greater number of broadly neutralizing epitopes than expected and provided invaluable information for design of immunogens as vaccine candidates.",

So achieving better crystals and, in particular, utilizing the enormous advances in cryo\u2010EM will undoubtedly enable the current 3 \u00c5 barrier to broken. Different functional forms of the trimer such as with CD4 receptor or CCR5 co\u2010receptor as high resolution will also provide invaluable information on how this metastable trimer transitions through prefusion to intermediate to fusion\u2010active forms. Design of germline trimers that can kick start the immune response along paths known to produce bnAbs in HIV\u2010infected individuals may also be instrumental in arriving at better vaccine candidates. Thus, while it has taken time, structural information on the HIV Env trimer is now coming at an impressive pace and should markedly accelerate the search for the elusive HIV vaccine.",
