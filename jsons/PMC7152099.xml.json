In autologous transplants, the stem cells serving as a marrow graft are derived from the patient themselves; in syngeneic transplants, the stem cells are derived from a genetically identical twin; and in allogeneic transplants, the stem cells are taken from a nonidentical sibling or unrelated donor. Because autologous and syngeneic transplants involve stem cells that are immunologically identical to the recipient, reactions between graft and host are avoided. In allogeneic transplants, mismatch between donor and recipient human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) mediate graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and graft rejection. The decision about which type of transplant to perform is based on the nature and stage of the underlying disease, on whether a suitable donor is available, and the medical condition of the recipient. The advantages to allogeneic transplantation over autologous transplantation include a higher likelihood that the stem cell product is free of tumor contamination and the presence of graft-versus-tumor activity.",

The galactomannan assay (which uses monoclonal antibody directed against galactomannan, a cell wall antigen) detects Aspergillus antigen by ELISA and is the only approved serologic marker for Aspergillus infection. It can be done on blood and BAL fluid. Early studies showed a sensitivity and specificity >90% with improvement in time to diagnosis. Results can be obtained in 3 h as opposed to the 4 weeks by standard culture methods. Serial monitoring increases the sensitivity and may detect the disease before development of clinical symptoms.",

The serologic status of the recipient as opposed to the donor is the primary determinant for CMV conversion. A shell vial culture with monoclonal antibody to p72 requires only 48 h, and tests for antigenemia are rapid, standardized, semiquantitative, and inexpensive. Nucleic acid amplification by PCR on DNA extracted from infected leukocytes also allows rapid diagnosis (detects infection 2 weeks before viral cultures become positive and 1 week before positive antigenemia) and is highly sensitive. CMV pneumonia, once fatal to 15% of allogeneic recipients, has become markedly less common with use of these early detection techniques that allow early treatment.",

Transbronchial lung biopsy is superior to BAL alone for the diagnosis of malignancy and may yield lung biopsies that are consistent with pulmonary drug toxicity, DAD, or BOOP.

The effect of surgical lung biopsy on patient outcome and survival is still controversial, however. Some studies have shown that patients with surgical lung biopsy had poorer outcomes, that the results rarely led to a change in therapy, and that the patients frequently had complications such as pneumothorax, hemothorax, prolonged mechanical ventilation, wound hematoma and dehiscence, incisional neuritis, and tumor recurrence at chest tube site. The procedure is associated with a postoperative mortality up to 8%. Survival at 30 and 90 days may be increased in patients who have a specific diagnosis. We recommend reserving open biopsy for patients whose underlying condition has a reasonable prognosis and those in whom the results might have a good chance of changing management.",
