            "text": "The brief report from Woo and Anderson (1) in this issue of the Journal aims to put some objective data 9 around the notion of profitability, expense, and how the current All Patients Refined Diagnosis-Related 10 Group (APR-DRG) payment system may not reward institutions adequately for high complexity cardiac 11 surgery among neonates. The financial analysis was well-conceived (though perhaps incompletely 12 explained) and, in a nutshell, demonstrated lower profitability ratios for cardiac surgery cases compared 13 to non-cardiac surgery cases. Reimbursement discrepancies were magnified for high complexity cases as 14 defined by those cases included in RACHS-1 levels 5 and 6 (2). In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, 15 federal and state initiatives to ensure financial viability of healthcare organizations and maintain a 16 robust, highly trained physician workforce will be prioritized. An important formative step to the 17 achievement of more stable healthcare delivery systems is the development of thoughtful The APR-DRG system is the most widely utilized re-imbursement model in children's hospitals, and 24 categorizes patients according to similar clinical attributes (3). In this system, all neonates undergoing 25 cardiac surgery who do not require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation are grouped into just 3 DRGs 26 based primarily on weight, and then stratified into severity levels. As correctly pointed out by the 27 authors, the 3 DRG classes are not specific for cardiac surgery and are therefore equivalent for both 28 cardiac and non-cardiac procedures. Moreover, the severity levels were adapted primarily for adult 29 Medicare patients, and are not based on accepted congenital heart surgery risk-adjustment models nor 30 case-complexity scoring systems. No data that validate the ordinal severity scale as an accurate metric in 31 the congenital cardiac surgery population is available, and most administrative datasets lack time-date 32 stamping, hampering the ability for coders to discriminate between a comorbidity that would increase the severity score, and a post-procedural complication. One alternative that we have explored at the 34 Cleveland Clinic that may increase the fidelity of cost and reimbursement data is to combine CPT codes 35 with DRG's, or, potentially supplanting DRG's with taxonomized CPT codes which are more granular.",

            "text": "The paper is timely, and highlights major issues with contemporary reimbursement models that lack 41 pediatric-specific value-based incentives, and seem disconnected from the increasingly resource-42 intensive demands of high-performing contemporary congenital heart centers. Using profitability ratios 43 that include reimbursement expense was an intuitive method to contextualize the malalignment of the 44 APR-DRG system. Although I am sympathetic to the argument for regionalization of complex congenital 45 cardiac surgery, we struggled with the authors' argument applied as a motivator for 'lower quality' 46 centers to refer patients to perceived 'high-quality' centers in order to maintain financial viability. We also were uncomfortable with the conclusion that centers of 'excellence' should negotiate higher base 48 rates because the designation 'excellence' is both subjective and imprecise and because hospital base increased tendencies toward 'treating-the-test' phenomena, and the inability to accurately attribute 81 performance outcomes given that patients attain care from multiple providers (4, 5) . Advanced bundled-82 payment structures for cardiovascular care such as the APR-DRG system represent a \"middle-ground\" in 83 between fee-for-service reimbursement and capitation. While there are obvious flaws in these models, 84 current 20-year projections that the number of Americans with cardiovascular disease will rise to 131.2 85 million (45 percent of the total U.S. population) with costs expected to exceed $1.1 trillion (6), virtually 86 guarantee more widespread adoption of advanced bundled-care reimbursement.",

Papers54 investigating 'resource-utilization' and cost in our field are numerous, (327 results in the last year based 55 on a PubMed search). Unfortunately, many employ oversimplified analyses that combine financial data 56 with overall length of hospital stay, incorrect metrics (charges instead of cost) and lack contextual 57 information critical to understanding whether increased monetary investments are justified. Given the 58 provocative nature of the topic covered by Woo et al., including an expert in econometrics was well-59 conceived and added credibility to the study findings. 60 61 Generalizability of the findings from Woo et al. (1) may be reduced by the use of an administrative 62 dataset, the Pediatric Health Information Systems (PHIS) that had limited participation in 2014 (46 63 centers), or the use of 6-year old data (likely chosen by necessity given that ICD-10 codes are not 64 presently mapped to RACHS-1 algorithms). However, these critiques are less relevant given that the PHIS 3 database contains arguably the most robust pediatric inpatient financial data available and wide 66 disparities in case-mix over time among mostly large congenital heart centers, are unlikely. A relevant 67 criticism that may have impacted the results, was the selection of a fixed base rate for all hospitals, 68 which was derived by reviewing publicly-disclosed CMS rates. In reality, individual hospital base rates 69 are highly variable, and are negotiated depending on hospital bargaining positions within their local 70 markets, patient socioeconomic factors, and payer-mixes. 71 72 How can we synthesize data from studies such as the one by Woo and Anderson (1) to inform the 73 conversation about optimizing reimbursement models? Traditional fee-for-service models, in which 74 payment was tied solely to the volume of care provided, are clearly not viable solutions in the face of 75 ever-rising healthcare expenditures. Advocates of pay-for-performance or 'value-based purchasing' 76 state that such systems improve overall quality of care, encourage competition and accountability 77 fueled by transparent metrics and consumer choice, and redirect resources to critical aspects of 78 population health. Critics highlight imperfect risk-adjustment systems, enhancement of healthcare 79 disparities as hospitals avoid treating socioeconomic disadvantaged or high-risk patients (risk-aversion), 80",
