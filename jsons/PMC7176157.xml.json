A pressing unanswered question remains over the relative role of\nlung cyclic stretch, in even moderate degrees, vs. low-volume injury. Low-volume injury promotes local concentration of\nstresses in the vicinity of collapsed regions in heterogeneously aerated lungs together with cyclical recruitment of\nairways and alveoli. This mechanism tends to predominate in more dependent regions of the lungs and to occur in previously\ndamaged lungs prone to collapse [13, 14]. Tremblay et al. showed increased production of inflammatory cytokines in lungs\nventilated without positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) [15]. Conversely,\nstretch tends to occur in non-dependent regions and results from increased regional lung volume. Overstretching of alveolar\nwalls causes endothelial and epithelial breaks and interstitial edema. Detachment of endothelial cells from the basement\nmembrane and death of epithelial cells with denuding of the epithelial basement membrane become obvious after 20 min of\nmechanical ventilation with very high tidal volumes (VT) [16]. The excessive deformation of epithelial and endothelial cells, as well as of the\nextracellular matrix, leads to an increased pro-inflammatory response. In some studies, low-volume injury was shown to\npredominate [13, 14, 17], whereas in others, including laboratory [18] and clinical studies [19], overdistension\nwas the prevailing VILI mechanism.",

            "text": "Positron emission tomography (PET) is an advanced nuclear medicine technique used for non-invasive and quantitative\nmeasurements of radioactivity concentration within living tissues. It is based on the physical properties of certain\nisotopes that, when decaying, emit a positron, a particle with a mass equal to an electron but with a positive charge. The\npositron almost immediately collides with an electron and both are annihilated. In this process, two high-energy photons\nare created and leave the site of annihilation in opposite directions. The PET scanner is equipped with a large number of\nscintillation detectors arranged in a ring surrounding the object of interest. When two photons with equal energies are\ndetected in coincidence, the event is stored in a dedicated data array called a sinogram. Typically, many millions of\ncoincidences are stored during a PET scan. Coincidences are collected for a finite amount of time, called\na time-frame. With modern PET scanners, a time-frame can range from a few seconds up to several minutes. Dynamic PET is\na term used when several time-frames are collected from the same area of the body to track the changes in radioactivity\nconcentration over time. The complete sinogram is then converted into a three-dimensional data array in a process called\nimage reconstruction. Each data entry in this new data array contains the actual radioactivity concentration of a certain\nportion of the body within the specified time-frame. The three-dimensional image array can be viewed as a stack of\ntomographic slices on a computer display with color codes for the actual radioactivity concentration. When kinetic\ninformation is wanted, the dynamic PET data are processed further with dedicated computer software. Regions of interest are\nplaced at will within the tissue and data resembling the changes in concentration over time are extracted. In advanced\nkinetic analysis, the time-activity curves of both the blood and the tissue of interest are needed. Advanced kinetic\nanalysis typically involves the use of computer-aided mathematical modeling.",

            "text": "In ALI, the non-barrier functions of the pulmonary endothelium have been emphasized. But the barrier function\nper se is essential in preserving the most important purpose of the lungs: the adequate\nexchange of respiratory gases. PET studies have shown that measures of barrier function are a non-specific index of lung\ninjury, indicating functional not structural lung injury [22, 23]. For example, PET imaging methods allow the rate at which proteins move across the\nendothelial barrier from vascular to extravascular compartments to be measured, the so called pulmonary transcapillary\nescape rate (PTCER). Palazzo et al. [24] used PET imaging to measure PTCER in\nan in vivo canine model of unilateral pulmonary ischemia-reperfusion injury and found\nthat it was increased in the ischemic lung. Interestingly, both lungs had an increased PTCER compared with control\nnon-ischemic lungs, suggesting that injury in one lung can lead to similar injury in the contralateral lung, a finding that\nhas been observed in an analogous clinical setting, such as acute unilateral pneumonia. Calandrino et al. [22] described that, while PTCER and extravascular density, a close correlate to\nextravascular lung water (EVLW), were both elevated in ARDS patients they correlated poorly with one another on a regional\nbasis. Moreover, as extravascular density returned to normal, PTCER remained elevated suggesting that lung tissue injury\nmight be \u2018subclinical\u2019 but still present, even after pulmonary edema has actually resolved. This observation\nwas further confirmed by Sandiford et al. [25] who examined the regional\ndistribution of PTCER and extravascular density more closely in ARDS patients and found ventral-dorsal gradients only for\nextravascular density but not for PTCER. Once more, functional injury was detected even in lung regions that appeared to be\nfree of structural injury. The finding that the lungs of ARDS patients are more diffusely involved than what might\notherwise be assumed from just structural radiological imaging, such as computed tomography (CT), helps explain why ARDS\nlungs are so vulnerable to VILI: radiographically \u2018normal\u2019 lung, i. e., lung with a normal EVLW content in non-dependent\nlung regions may still be abnormal and vulnerable to mechanical stresses caused by mechanical ventilation. These data tell\nus that non-dependent regions of ARDS lung are \u2018at risk\u2019 because they demonstrate subclinical evidence of injury, which can\nbe made manifest by inappropriate ventilator use. Jones et al. [26] showed\na surprisingly high pulmonary uptake of [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose\n(18F-FDG) in patients with head injury at risk of developing ARDS but without lung symptoms at\nthe time of the scan. This signal may reflect sequestration of primed neutrophils in lung capillaries. In vitro studies in isolated human neutrophils have demonstrated that the uptake of deoxyglucose\nis increased to the same extent in cells that are only primed or primed and stimulated [27]. This finding indicates the vulnerability of these patients while on ventilatory\nsupport, because, even though neutrophils remain in a primed state, any additional stimulus precipitates actual tissue\ndamage.",

Although not usually characterized by an intense\n18F-FDG uptake [36], macrophages may play a role in\nthe generation of VILI [37]. The latest evidence [38] suggests that macrophages, as well as type 2 epithelial cells, might contribute to the\n18F-FDG uptake signal during VILI. Therefore, although the overall\n18F-FDG uptake signal is a complex mixture of the metabolic activity of many cell types,\nprior [29, 34\u201336] and very recent studies [17] have\nestablished that the major influence on the regional signal is the high metabolic activity of recruited neutrophils.

We evaluated the individual contributions of\nregional injurious mechanisms during early stages of VILI. To accomplish this aim, we created an experimental VILI model\nand designed a study that produced lungs heterogeneously aerated with significant amounts of non-aerated, poorly and\nnormally aerated, and hyperinflated lung tissue (shown by CT). Within the same lung, we simultaneously found tidal\nhyperinflation, predominantly located in the non-dependent lung region, and collapse with tidal recruitment, mostly located\nin the dependent region. Remarkably, these two regions, classically comprising the major mechanisms of VILI, had\n18F-FDG uptakes similar to the healthy control group. On the other hand, the remaining regions\nsituated in the intermediate portions of the lung presented a significantly higher uptake. Similarly, in the normal and\npoorly aerated regions we found the highest differences in 18F-FDG uptake as compared to healthy\ncontrols, whereas the hyperinflated and non-aerated regions were similar to the control group (Fig. 1). We believe these findings challenge the current notion that hyperinflation and/or repeated\ncollapse and re-expansion of alveolar units play the major role in early VILI. Instead, our data suggest that tidal stretch\nwas highest in the poorly and normally aerated regions and this mechanism is the most important trigger of inflammation in\nthese conditions. They also support the concept that the smaller the ventilated lung, the higher the VILI-triggering forces\nwill be, as a larger fraction of VT is delivered to a smaller lung volume.",

These heterogeneities would tend to produce an uneven distribution of VT within\nlung regions and might have contributed to VILI. Perlman and Bhattacharya used real-time confocal microscopy to determine\nthe micromechanics of alveolar perimeter distension in perfused rat lungs [41]. These investigators were able to image a 2-\u00b5m thick optical section under the\npleura. Five to eight segments were identified within each alveolus. The average length of these segments was compared\nduring normal inflation and hyperinflation. They found segmental distension to be heterogeneous within a single\nalveolus. Similarly, by using synchrotron-based X-ray tomographic microscopy on isolated rat lungs, Rausch\net al. [42] estimated that local strains developing in alveolar walls were as\nmuch as four times higher than the global, with \u2018strain hotspots\u2019 occurring within the thinnest parts of the alveolar\nwalls. When studying 3D microscopic distribution of lung parenchyma, using it as an input to their finite element modeling\nof alveolar expansion, they observed that thin regions may become overstretched, whereas regions with tissue accumulation\nremain unchallenged. These data fit with our own results and strongly suggest that a tidal stretch of the \u2018healthy\u2019 aerated\nparts of the heterogeneous aerated ARDS lungs can play a primary role in the activation of the inflammatory signaling\ncascade.",

Interestingly, neither they nor we found an association between cyclic alveolar\nrecruitment-derecruitment and increased metabolic activity. Some key differences between this clinical study and our\nexperimental observations highlight their complementary nature in terms of understanding VILI: 1) the time on mechanical\nventilation before the clinical PET study averaged nine days and ranged from two to sixteen days, likely mixing distinct\nphases of ARDS and VILI pathophysiology, whereas our experimental study focused on early (hours) ARDS; 2) patients had\nlimited tidal recruitment (2.9 % of the total lung weight) due to the lung-protective mechanical ventilation strategy\napplied, raising the question whether conditions with higher tidal recruitment would have produced more inflammation in\nthose or in other regions, which our experimental data ruled out; 3) likewise, the amount of tissue undergoing\nhyperinflation was much smaller in the clinical study compared to our experimental study, because of the relatively low\nplateau pressures and VT used in the patients.

            "text": "At least three mechanisms could explain the increased Ki in poorly aerated regions: 1)\nalveolar cyclic recruitment at the subvoxel level; 2) cyclic opening and closing of small airways; or 3) increased tidal\nstretch. Measurements based on fluorescent microspheres confirmed the existence of ventilation heterogeneity down to length\nscales of 2 cm3 [43], and findings from synchrotron\nCT suggested that heterogeneity of specific ventilation (defined as ventilation per unit gas volume) can occur at lung\nvolumes as low as 1 mm3 [44]. Recently, Wellman\net al. have elegantly developed methods using PET to assess heterogeneity of specific ventilation at length scales below\nand above the effective image resolution of 12 mm [40]. Sub-resolution\nspecific ventilation heterogeneity was reflected by multi-compartment voxel-level tracer kinetics during washout of\n[13N]nitrogen (13NN) from alveolar air space. These authors modeled\nthe washout kinetics of 13NN with PET to examine how specific ventilation heterogeneity at\ndifferent length scales was influenced by lung aeration. They showed that airway narrowing or alveolar de-recruitment can\noccur in poorly aerated lung regions especially at low length scales with a significant component derived from\nsub-resolution (< 12 mm) length scales. Components of specific ventilation heterogeneity at all studied length scales\n(< 12 to 60 mm) were highest in poorly aerated regions. Rylander et al., when studying the size and distribution of\na \u201cpoorly aerated\u201d compartment in ARDS patients, observed an uneven distribution of ventilation due to the presence of\nsmall-airway closure and/or obstruction [45]. Of note, airway dysfunction has\nbeen increasingly recognized as an important contributor to pulmonary impairment in patients with ARDS [46]. Animal models of ARDS have shown that, in addition to damage to the parenchyma, small\nairway injuries are characterized by bronchiolar epithelial necrosis and sloughing and by rupture of alveolar-bronchiolar\nattachments [47]. In humans who died with ARDS, small airway changes were\ncharacterized by wall thickening with inflammation, extracellular matrix remodeling, and epithelial\ndenudation [46, 48].",

When comparing protective ventilation (VT 8 mL/kg and PEEP titrated to obtain\na plateau pressure (Pplat) of 30 cmH2O) with injurious ventilation (zero PEEP and\nVT titrated to obtain a Pplat of 30 cmH2O), the former resulted in a more\nhomogeneously distributed uptake. Their findings are compatible with the concept that ventilation strategy plays an early\npathogenic role in determining the profile of inflammatory cell distribution before lung injury is established and\nemphasize that the prevention of VILI should be a key aspect of patient management, even when mechanical ventilation\nperiods and the underlying level of injury are limited [49]. Such results\nsupport former suggestion that heterogeneous inflammation may be an important element in the pathogenesis of\nARDS [13].
