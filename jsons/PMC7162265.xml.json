H1N1 has\nproven to be frightening and to be quicker moving, more virulent, and two to three times\nmore likely to cause death than this year's seasonal flu, but, thankfully, it has not\ndelivered the disaster of the major and deadly pandemic that many expected. Seasonal\nflu, meantime, continues to cause about 35,000 deaths per year in the United States and\nto cause widespread workplace shortages. What, then, distinguishes pandemic flu from the\nseasonal variety, and what makes influenza both so much a mundane part of everyone's\nlife and a true disease threat? Pandemic flu is marked by its novelty (that it is caused\nby a strain not previously seen in humans), by its virulence, and by its ease of\ntransmission. In the northern hemisphere in the fall of 2009, for example, pandemic H1N1\nwas outstripping all the seasonal flu strains with respect to its rate of spread and the\nlikelihood that those who contracted the virus grew sick, often very sick.",

The 1918\u20131919 pandemic was widely\nreferred to as the \u201cSpanish influenza\u201d because it was first reported in large numbers in\nSpain. Some contemporary theories attributed its origins to China (see \u201cThe Influenza\nPandemic of 1918\u201d at http://virus.stanford.edu/uda/), but it seems the first eruptions\nof influenza occurred on military bases in the American Midwest. A recent study\nconducted in London suggested the pandemic might actually have emerged in France, from\nthe ecology of juxtaposed soldiers, gas, pigs, and fowl (Oxford et al., 2005). The longstanding association of certain\ndiseases \u2013 particularly the flu \u2013 with nations, regions, or races (particularly Asians\nin the 20th century) is, I argue, part of why the United States and global public health\nbodies like the World Health Organization (WHO)\nwere slow to respond to H5N1 virus in Hong Kong in 1997. Even since 2004, when H5N1\nbegan to draw much international attention, there has been consistent debate about\nwhether wealthier nations should rush resources to the source of an avian influenza\nepidemic \u2013 should that epidemic start in Asia or Africa \u2013 or wait until the virus\nreaches their borders.",

Assuming that it was the very unfamiliarity of\nthe virus that killed so many infected with it, the 1918 virus, now genetically\nrecreated from frozen tissue samples, could potentially lead to a vaccine that\nsufficiently resembled what a mutated H5N1 might look like. Such a vaccine might not be\na perfect enough match to prevent sickness, but it might give the immune system enough\nfamiliarity with the antigen to reduce the number of deaths from the disease (Matthews, 2006; Leavitt, 2006). Having an imperfect-match vaccine stockpiled might curtail\nhospitalizations and deaths in the months it takes to produce a perfect-match vaccine,\nas we have seen with H1N1 vaccine production in 2009.",

Live bird markets are a concern\nbecause birds from many different sources are kept in very tight proximity to each other\nand because they are kept in conditions that create extreme stress for them, which\nreduces their immunity. In industrial meat and egg farms in the United States, we see\nthe same issue. Animals bought from many different auctions, coming from different\nregions, are kept in extremely overcrowded and highly stressed conditions. As well, as\nJean Halley discusses in her work on cattle ranching, industrially farmed animals are\nbred to have abbreviated lives \u2013 they are essentially born to die (personal\ncommunication, July 29, 2009). This means that animals can contract viruses and then be\nsent to slaughter before the viral infection begins to show visible symptoms. Richard\nRhodes, in his book on mad cow disease, discusses how this compressed birth-to-slaughter\ntime-frame makes it practically impossible to know if beef cows are infected or not,\nespecially if the infectious agent at issue is a slow virus like the one that causes mad\ncow disease (1998). This matter of diagnosis is exacerbated by the fact that most\nanimals that are industrially farmed for slaughter exist in such inadequate conditions\nthat many of them are sick all the time. Most companies compensate for this by feeding\nthem large doses of antibiotics as a common course. Aside from the concern about\ncreating population-level antibiotic resistance, this practice has the added downside of\nthe false but common American perception that antibiotics can cure everything (see,\ne.g., Andremont & Tibon-Cornillot, 2006).\nThey do not, certainly, provide any protection against viruses.

While the FAO and OIE do, as we have seen, have\nprinciples in place that should guide such measures, these principles are mere ideas\nuntil the far-sighted, collaborative, practical work is done to make them logistically\ndeployable. Unless such practical plans exist, animal culls are more likely to cause\nharm than to contain influenza outbreaks. As domestic fowl and other animals were being\nculled in Turkey in 2005, for example, wild fowl carrying H5N1 were already migrating\nelsewhere. To return to Laurie Garrett's words, wise action would turn to ecology for\nits perspective, a viewpoint cognizant of how microbes, animals, and humans all function\ntogether and affect each other irrespective of the socially constructed borders\n(economic, national, and species) that fundamentally structure how most people conceive\nof the world but are meaningless on an animal or microbial level. For example, how does\nthe ecology through which cheap meat is produced, killed, and distributed\ninternationally produce new microbes and how does it increase the vulnerability of\nfarmed animals and the workers at those farms, slaughterhouses, and warehouses? How do\npeople and animals coexist and, in sharing space, also share the risk of influenza\ninfection?",

As Bussolini told me, Esposito writes that the medical condition\nconsists of inoculating a limited amount of the disease just as, in rituals, a little\nbit of violence (the burdening and driving out) is injected into the social body to\nprevent greater violence (turmoil within the community). Girard draws a link between\nthis ancient form of managing violence and the modern act of inoculation. This injection\n(the inoculation) is a repetition of the sacrifices (as in the scapegoat) and, \u201cas in\nall types of sacrificial protection, naturally contains the possibility of a\ncatastrophic inversion\u201d (personal communication, April 11, 2009).",

An emphasis on isolating specific pandemic threats only\nas they seem to emerge creates fits and starts of attention but very little consistent,\nsystemic thought about prevention.
