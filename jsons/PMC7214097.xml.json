The first step was to fold the material in two and pin the pattern to the material. This is cut with a scissors (a view of the step by step mask manufacture and application is available in supplementary video www.dcra.ie) [6]. A small hem is added to the lateral edges to allow the elastic strap to be inserted with ease (marked as B in Fig. 1). Folding the top flaps over, the leaves are sewn together and then stitched to the bottom unfolded leaf. The free flap of the bottom end is then stitched to the top but leaving a 6-cm opening to allow it to be inverted. The mask is then turned inside out. The apical defect of approximately 6 cm is hand stitched closed. All the seams are on the inside so an overlocking stitch was not necessary. At both bases, a 7-mm tunnel was created by stitching to allow the passage of the elastic bands, which can be facilitated by a small round safety pin (marked as A in Fig. 1 in video). The nasal bridge bone was made from a 14 cm length of 3-mm wire coated in plastic and an additional layer of insulating tape was wound the exterior of the wire. The elastic strapping used was 5 mm in width and 60 cm in length for both top and bottom straps.",

These findings echo those with SARS-CoV-1, in which these forms of transmission were associated with nosocomial spread and super-spreading events [10]. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends a 6-ft (2-m) separation [11]. However, Bourouiba et al. suggest that these distances are based on estimates of range that have not considered the possible presence of a high-momentum cloud carrying the droplets long distances. Given the turbulent puff cloud dynamic model, recommendations for separations of 3 to 6 feet (1\u20132 m) may underestimate the distance, timescale and persistence over which the cloud and its pathogenic payload travel, thus generating an underappreciated potential exposure range for a health care worker. For these and other reasons, wearing of PPE is important for health care workers caring for patients who may be infected, even if they are farther than 6 ft away from a patient [12]. This may apply to patients and their families also in clinical areas. There is increasing global suggestions that face masks should be worn at all times, but this strategy has yet to be proven.",
