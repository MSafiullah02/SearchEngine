Diabetes and hyperglycemia are reported to exacerbate inflammation by increasing the release of tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) and interleukin (IL) 10. [10] [11] [12] Clinical Care/Education/Nutrition In addition, diabetes may lead to lung dysfunction, such as decreased forced expiratory volume and forced vital capacity. 13 Therefore, diabetes could possibly be a risk factor for covid-19. Our study aims to investigate the clinical characteristics of patients with severe covid-19 with diabetes mellitus, and the association of diabetes with the outcome in patients with severe covid-19.",

But few researches focused on the clinical characteristics of patients with severe covid-19 with diabetes and the direct correlation between diabetes and survival rate in patients with severe covid-19. Our observations were in line with previous findings that the prevalence of diabetes in patients with severe covid-19 is up to 24%. Patients with diabetes were more likely to develop covid-19, which may be due to the fact that patients with diabetes had low pulmonary function. 13 But the mechanisms explaining lung dysfunction in diabetes remain vague. Animal studies suggested that alveolar capillary microangiopathy and interstitial fibrosis were induced by glycosylation of the lung tissue collagen in the diabetes model, and this process was mediated by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase and angiotensin II. 16 17 Autopsy also identified that patients with diabetes had thickening lung basal lamina, 18 which may have an influence on pulmonary diffusion function.",

[23] [24] [25] [26] Covid-19 was defined as \u03b2-coronavirus, which had 85% sequence similarity with SARS and 50% sequence similarity with MERS. 27 The structural protein S of covid-19 invades lung cells though the binding of structural protein S to the receptors, such as ACE2 and CD147. 28 Severe pneumonia causes lung damage, which may cause acute respiratory distress syndrome, and even lead to septic shock. Similar to previous studies, patients with severe covid-19 with diabetes in our study were particularly susceptible to receive mechanical ventilation and intensive care, and had higher mortality than those without diabetes. Meanwhile the median survival duration from hospital admission was significantly shortened in patients with diabetes compared with patients without diabetes. The mechanisms linking diabetes with higher mortality and shorter survival time in patients with diabetes were lung dysfunction and aggravated inflammation, which we discussed in the previous part. Another potential mechanism was that hyperglycemia was a risk factor for mortality. 25 Hyperglycemia induced by diabetes was linked to aggressive glycosylation, 29 which leads to overproduction of advanced glycation end products. And aberrant glycosylation was considered to be related to dysfunction of immunoglobulins. 30 Dysregulation in glycosylation of IgG Fc domains may lead to susceptibility to infectious diseases. 31 In addition, dysfunction of IgG may impair clearance function between phagocytic cell antigens (such as bacteria or virus, which may aggravate serious infection). And hyperglycemia may be due to following reasons: (1) Patients with severe covid-19 were unable to take food regularly, and the nutritional support was mainly though intravenous fluid infusion.",

First, our study found that diabetes was associated with high mortality and short survival duration in patients with severe covid-19. Second, clinical data of patients with severe covid-19 were collected from Tongji Hospital, which is a designated hospital responsible for the treatment of patients with severe covid-19 in Wuhan. Third, all authors are first line doctors, who could directly observe participants. There are several limitations of our study. First, the sample size was relatively small. Second, a retrospective method was used in our study. Third, high mortality was observed in our study. It may be explained by the fact that Tongji Hospital is the designated hospital for severe cases. In fact, with the accumulation of treatment experience, the mortality in patients with severe covid-19 dramatically decreases. So the real mortality in patients with severe covid-19 still needs further study on large sample.",

Patients with severe covid-19 with diabetes exhibit severe inflammation response. Furthermore, our results suggest that diabetes can be considered a risk factor for death in patients with severe covid-19. Finally, intensive treatment for diabetes should be considered in the management of covid-19.",
