In allogeneic HSCT, patients receive hematopoietic stem cells from a nonidentical sibling or unrelated matched donor. In syngeneic HSCT, patients receive hematopoietic stem cells from a genetically identical twin. The source of the donor hematopoietic stem cells can be bone marrow, peripheral blood, or umbilical cord blood. Because autologous and syngeneic transplants involve stem cells that are immunologically identical to the recipient, reactions between graft and host are avoided. In allogeneic transplants, mismatch between donor and recipient human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) mediate graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), which may lead to allograft rejection.",
