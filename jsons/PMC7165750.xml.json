In young pups, or in combination with other pathogens, CCoV is responsible for diarrhoea, vomiting, dehydration, loss of appetite and occasional death. It has been observed that CCoV faecal shedding may be longer than reported (Keenan et al., 1976). Pratelli et al. (2001) have detected CCoV in the faeces of naturally infected pups for a period of up to 180 days. Hence, it can be concluded that asymptomatic dogs could serve as a continuous source of the virus and may induce an immune response in kennel population without obvious clinical disease.",

In the test, the primer pair CCoV1\u2010CCoV2, which amplified a 409\u2010bp fragment of M gene, was employed. On the positive faecal samples, a second round of RT\u2010PCR using primer pair CCoV1a\u2010CCoV2 (Pratelli et al., 2002b) was applied to confirm whether CCoV type I (atypical CCoV strains) was present or not in the samples. Primer sequences and their positions (accession no.

In the present study, 21 sera detected as positive by ELISA, were negative in SNT. On the contrary, there was no serum sample positive by SNT/negative by ELISA. Thus, the results obtained from ELISA (74.3%) could possibly be accepted as true prevalence of CCoV antibodies in Turkish dogs (Table 1). Because of a statistically important difference between the results of the two methods, it is thought that ELISA is advantageous for serological diagnosis of CCoV infection. Such results had also been found for different agents (Paessler and Pfeffer, 2003).",
