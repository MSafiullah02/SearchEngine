In addition, as the emergence of COVID-19 affects the commodity markets in China and other regions in the world, the proliferation of COVID-19 has caused impacts of global crude oil demand. Since January 2020, the new coronavirus has affected China\u2019s crude oil demand to a certain extent. At the end of February, it further expanded to South Korea, Iran, Italy and other countries and regions. In addition, in March, the United States, Britain, Spain and other countries spread rapidly, which affected the global demand for crude oil and caused panic about the economic outlook of the global market. We note that the international benchmark Brent crude oil fell to its lowest level since 2002.",

The Johansen cointegration test was used to study the covariates between crude oil prices and corn, sorghum, sugar, soybean, soybean oil, and palm oil prices from 2003 to 2007 in [2]. The analysis showed no co-integration relationship over the entire sample period. However, analysis of the 2006-2007 sub-sample showed that soybean and corn prices were cointegrated with crude oil. Besides, Natanelov et al. [3] studied the co-movements between crude oil and agricultural commodities by Johansen cointegration, Threshold cointegration, and vector error correction model. Their results indicated that the relationship is a dynamic concept, and some economic and policy development may change the relationship between crude oil and agricultural commodities. Du et al. [4] studied the fluctuation relationship between international crude oil futures and corn, wheat futures markets from 1998 to 2009 by using stochastic volatility models. The models were estimated by using Bayesian analysis, Markov chains, and Monte Carlo methods. They found that crude oil futures and corn, wheat futures markets have significant volatility spillover effects after the second half of 2006, which has a huge connection with the rise of bioethanol fuel.",

            "text": "We envisage several reasons for the long-range correlation between crude oil and selected agricultural products. For sugar future, the medium between crude oil and the white sugar market is sugar-based ethanol, and a considerable portion of international sugar is used to produce ethanol. While ethanol is mainly used for fuel, the price of crude oil has a greater impact on the production and sales of fuel ethanol. When the price of crude oil is low, the market expects that the production and sales of fuel ethanol will decrease, companies will increase the sugar ratio, sugar supply tends to be loose, and the downward pressure on sugar prices will increase; when the price of crude oil is high, the market expected production and sales of fuel ethanol will increase, companies usually increase ethanol production, white sugar supply tends to be tight, and the upward momentum of sugar prices has increased. That is, crude oil regulates the supply and demand balance of sugar by affecting the production and sales of ethanol, therefore, crude oil has a cross-correlation on the sugar future market. Ethanol fuel is also a medium for wheat and crude oil. The new ethanol production line mainly uses wheat and barley. Ethanol can help people reduce their dependence on petroleum and is a renewable biofuel. The main link between crude oil and the cotton market is the chemical fiber. The main raw materials for the production of chemical fiber are PTA and MEG, and the final upstream raw material of the PTA and MEG is crude oil. Chemical fiber and cotton are mainly used to produce textile and apparel products, and the two categories have a strong substitution relationship. At last, the correlation between crude oil and orange juice price is also strong. We assume that crude oil has a greater impact on the transportation cost of orange juice, and large fluctuation in crude oil prices often change the sentiment of the entire commodity market, it is highly likely that orange juice price is affected by the sentiment of the entire commodity market and show a strong correlation with crude oil price.",

Afterwards, MF-DCCA approach was utilized to further analyze the cross-correlations between the Brent crude oil and agricultural futures. The computed \u0394Hxy(q) and \u0394\u03b1xy indicated that the time series pair LCO-LSU has the strongest cross-correlation. Besides, the sources of the cross-correlations were envisaged and discussed.

The values of Hxy(2) showed that the feature of positive persistence became stronger after the emergence of COVID-19, and \u0394Hxy(q) and \u0394\u03b1xy calculated in period 1 and 2 showed the cross-correlations of multifractality between crude oil and sugar future market is the strongest.
