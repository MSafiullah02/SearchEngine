Resting NK cells are found in large quantities in the spleen, uterus, liver, and blood, but can be rapidly recruited to any site in the body in response to chemokine signaling from damaged tissue, tumor cells, and cells infected with a pathogen. The NK cell surface markers include the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM: CD56) or the low affinity IgG receptor CD16, or both. These large, non-phagocytic cells of the lymphoid system share the same lineage as mature T cells of the adaptive immune system, but differ in a number of important regards. The first is that NK cells lack T cell receptors (TCRs) but are activated by recognizing infected or tumor cells on which the density of molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC: see Chapter 6: Adaptive Immune Responses to Infection) has been reduced. Viruses downregulate surface MHC class I molecules, in order to escape recognition by CD8+ T cells. However, cells lacking class I MHC molecules are susceptible to NK cells: the so-called missing self hypothesis. This reduced MHC density on the target cell disturbs the balance between activator and inhibitory receptor signaling at the surface of the NK cell, as the inhibitory receptors recognize class I MHC molecules on the surface of healthy cells. Second, NK cells are activated by several non-antigen-specific mechanisms to produce preformed pore-inducing (perforin) and granzyme molecules that induce apoptosis in the target cell: this is in contrast to cytotoxic, CD8+ T cells of the adaptive immune response that only produce these effector molecules once activated via recognition of class I MHC molecules in association with viral peptides. The third, and most important, difference is that NK cells do not need to proliferate and differentiate into viral-specific cells before activation. Overall, NK cells, while not displaying any immunological specificity for particular viral antigens, play an essential role in defense by mediating the death of infected cells by apoptosis, and by priming the adaptive response through secretion of several cytokines including interferon \u03b3, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), IL-4, and IL-13 ( Fig. 5.1) .", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2323, "end": 2332, "text": "Fig. 5.1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "THE ROLE OF NATURAL KILLER (NK) CELLS AND THE LINK WITH ADAPTIVE IMMUNITY"}, {"text": "Several families of viruses have developed mechanisms for evading NK responses, most notably members of the ", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "THE ROLE OF NATURAL KILLER (NK) CELLS AND THE LINK WITH ADAPTIVE IMMUNITY"}, {"text": "As mentioned above, an early important line of defense is the recognition of viral components by germlineencoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) capable of distinguishing viral products from those of the host. PRRs are expressed in many cell types likely to be present at portals of virus entry, including macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils, NK cells, endothelial cells, and mucosal epithelial cells. These cellular receptor molecules recognize different classes of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). There are a number of classes of PRRs that are present on the majority of mammalian cells. These include the C-type lectin receptors, NOD-like receptors, the transmembrane Toll like Receptor (TLR) receptors, and the cytosolic RIG-I like receptors (RLR) such as RIG-I and MDA5. TLRs consist of amino-terminal leucine-rich repeat domains responsible for PAMP recognition and a cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal domain that recognizes interleukin-1 and leads to downstream signal transduction. In contrast, the RLRs recognize associated PAMP via caspase activation and recruitment (CARD) domains. Common to both classes of PRR, the PRR-PAMP complex then triggers a series of signaling cascades, culminating in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and other . Importantly, these molecules also play an important role in the development of adaptive immune responses necessary for viral clearance and sustained, long-term immunological memory. Most attention has been focused on the class of TLRs and RLRs. The TLRs were first discovered in studies of fruit flies (Drosophila spp.) and subsequently 10 homologues were found in humans.

(A)Healthy cells express self class I MHC molecules which are recognized by inhibitory receptors, thus ensuring NK cells do not attack normal cells. Healthy cells may express ligands for activating receptors (not shown) or they may not express such ligands (as shown), but they do not activate NK cells because they engage the inhibitory receptors. (B) In virus-infected cells, class I MHC expression is reduced so that the inhibitory receptors are not engaged and ligands for activating receptors are expressed. The result is that NK cells are activated and the infected cells are killed. Reproduced fromMacLachlan, N.J., Dubovi, E.J., 2011. Veterinary Virology, fourth ed.
