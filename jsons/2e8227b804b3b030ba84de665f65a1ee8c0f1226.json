In this work we analyze the effect of current social distancing measures in the United States. We quantify the reduction in doubling rate, by state, that is associated with social distancing. We find that social distancing is associated with a statistically-significant reduction in the doubling rate for all but three states. At the same time, we do not find significant evidence that social distancing has resulted in a reduction in the number of daily confirmed cases. Instead, social distancing has merely stabilized the spread of the disease. We provide an illustration of our findings for each state, including point estimates of the effective reproduction number, R, both with and without social distancing. We also discuss the policy implications of our findings.",

Efforts to stem the spread of the disease have resulted in unprecedented societal disruptions [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] . These efforts have largely taken the form of mandated or recommended social distancing measures by state and local governments. These social distancing measures incur substantial economic cost [10, 11] . At the same time, their efficacy in reducing the spread of the disease is presumed but not well understood. Quantifying the benefits of social distancing measures is of paramount importance as policy makers consider how and when to relax such measures.",

Compensating for the delay between infection and confirmed diagnosis is a central component of the analysis. We find that in all states except Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota, the intervention is associated with a statistically-significant decrease in the doubling rate of the spread. The average of the preintervention doubling-rate point estimates across the states was 0.302 days \u22121 , meaning that the number of new infections per day was doubling every 3.31 days. Post-intervention, the average fell to 0.010 days \u22121 , meaning that the number of infections was still increasing, but required about 100 days to double. We are not able to conclude that any of the states made the spread subcritical (i.e., obtained a negative doubling rate) through the interventions, although some have negative point estimates of the post-intervention doubling rate. Thus while this study finds substantial evidence that social distancing interventions reduce the reproduction rate of SARS-CoV-2, it also suggests that these measures are insufficient to make the spread subcritical. That is, social distancing has largely plateaued, but not decreased, the number of infected individuals. The policy implications of this finding are discussed in Section 5.",

Classical methods [13, 14] for that problem assume a time-invariant distribution over the number of descendants, which differs from the change-point method used here. Wallinga and Teunis [15] provide an approach for estimating the number of people infected by individual patients with an infectious disease, not merely the average over this group. By considering when specific patients were known to be infected, they obtain an estimate of the infection rate over time. They assume a closed system, however, in which there are no external infections beyond the first. Bettencourt and Ribeiro [16] note that this method requires a large number of samples, and they propose a Bayesian alternative requiring less data. A recent extension of their approach has been applied to COVID-19 tracking in the US [17] . Their method (and the dashboard in [17] ) does not account for interventions, so it does not provide separate pre-and post-intervention estimates of parameters, which are necessary for determining the efficacy of the intervention. Intervention-aware methods, such as those considered here, also provide more accurate real-time estimates by separating data that comes from different regimes. The concern that the Bettencourt and Ribeiro estimator would be slow to reflect interventions has already been raised [17] .",

They find the impact of social distancing to be relatively modest, increasing the doubling time from 3.3 days to 5.0 days. They implicitly assume the average time between infection and confirmed test, which we call confirmed case delay, to be 4 days. They also rely on data only up to (and including) March 30th. Our estimates place the confirmed case delay at around 12 days, so that the effects of the interventions would not appear until late March. By allowing for a 12 day delay and using data up to and including April 23rd, we conclude that social distancing interventions are associated with a much larger reduction in the spread of the disease than that found by Siedner et al.",

When analyzing pandemic spreads, it is common to infer the effective reproduction number, R, instead of the doubling rate. We focus on the doubling rate because it can be more directly estimated from the time-series of confirmed cases. One can compute R from the doubling rate \u03b2 and the distribution of the serial interval using the Lotka-Euler equation [26, 27] . Applying Jensen's inequality to this equation gives an upper bound on R in terms of \u03b2 and the mean serial interval \u00b5 [28] ,",

Let C n denote the number of new confirmed cases on day n, where the index n = 1 refers to the first day after March 1st for which the state records at least two consecutive days of positive confirmed cases.

We use the algorithm in [31] for this purpose, which declines to identify a changepoint (effectively setting \u03b2 1 = \u03b2 0 ) if there is insufficient evidence of a change.

Since the number of deaths is at least an order of magnitude lower than the number of cases, for most states the former is too noisy to be of much use. For these states, however, it provides a useful comparison with the confirmed case counts. The results of our analysis for these three states is shown in Figure 5 . For all three states, we see two regimes for the growth rate for both the confirmed cases and deaths data. The growth rate begins in a supercritical state indicating exponential growth. The growth rate then decreases substantially, presumably indicating that the intervention is making an impact, albeit with a delayed effect. However, we note that the number of confirmed cases and deaths does not rapidly decline after the change for California and New York, whereas the Washington plot appears to show a decrease in both cases and deaths as a result of the intervention.",

The lag between illness onset and case confirmation is determined using a normalized cross-correlation operation (Fig. 10, bottom) . The lag is estimated to be 7 days. When added to the incubation time, this results in a total time of 12 days from exposure to confirmed test, which essentially coincides with the estimate of 11.5 days obtained in the body of the paper. An earlier work estimated the mean time from symptom onset to confirmed test to be 4.8 days [42] , which translates to a point estimate of N of about 10 days.",
