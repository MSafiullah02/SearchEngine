In the Medical Oncology section for ER+, HER2\u2212 invasive breast cancer, the authors point out that some of these cancers may have surgical intervention delayed with the administration of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy based upon clinical parameters or genomic assay results. Unfortunately, the language in this section elevates a particular commercial test by including the following statement \u201cespecially Recurrence Score, which may be sent on a core biopsy.\u201d Additionally, the only citations referenced for \u201cgenomic assays\u201d or \u201cluminal A signatures\u201d pertain to the same Recurrence Score test. Based on these current references, the reader might incorrectly conclude the following two points: (1) only the 21-gene Recurrence Score has supportive data for use on core biopsy and (2) a \u201cLuminal A\u201d result can be derived from the 21-gene Recurrence Score. For the first point, we firmly believe that it was not the intention of the consortium to recommend a preference for one test over another and believe that the cited references should be updated to reflect a more comprehensive list of available genomic tests. On the second point, the 21-gene Recurrence Score cannot provide molecular subtyping information, so any implication that it has this ability is incorrect. The only commercially available test in the US that can report molecular subtyping to distinguish Luminal patients from other subtypes is the 80-gene test (Agendia, BluePrint). While the 50-gene assay (Prosigna) is also capable of molecular subtyping, that functionality is not available in the US market.",

            "text": "Furthermore, the statement regarding the likelihood of benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT) in patients with a \u201clow-risk\u201d genomic test result does not reference trials or studies where NCT was actually administered. We were the primary investigators on a large prospective neoadjuvant breast cancer treatment trial exploring real-world utility of genomic testing on core biopsy with the 70-gene and 80-gene assays (NBRST, clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT01479101). We feel that this important data can elucidate molecular subtype-driven response which would be helpful to include in this consortium guidance as a means to identify those patients most likely to achieve pCR [1, 2]. Importantly, observations from the NBRST study demonstrated that approximately 1 out of 4 patients are reclassified from their clinical subtype (based on IHC/FISH) to a different functional molecular subtype, which aligns more precisely with their observed response to NCT [1, 2]. These clinically ER+, molecularly Basal patients have a 34% pCR rate with NCT similar to pathologically \u201ctriple-negative\u201d patients (TNBC) where delays in systemic treatment or surgery can negatively impact outcomes. Consistent with these findings, the prospective I-SPY 2 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01042379) has confirmed the presence and predictive value of this ER+ Basal-type profile, which was identified in almost 30% of clinically ER+, HER2\u2212 patients in the trial.",
