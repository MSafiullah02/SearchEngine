Upper respiratory illnesses (URIs) are the most common infections in humans in both temperate and tropical climates and are primarily viral in etiology. The frequency of URIs among children is much greater than in adults.8 Although the frequency of URIs in the tropics appears to be no higher than in temperate climates, children in the tropics often suffer multiple comorbid conditions including chronic malnutrition. Undernourished children experience respiratory infections, coupled with bouts of diarrhea, intestinal helminths, epidemic measles, and more. These comorbidities allow what would be a mild respiratory illness in a healthy child to cause significant morbidity or mortality.9 The role of viral URIs, particularly influenza and respiratory syncytial virus, in predisposing individuals to subsequent bacterial pneumonia, predominantly with Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, has emphasized the importance of controlling epidemic influenza in developing nations where vaccines have been historically underutilized.10\n",

Death from measles is usually associated with either primary viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial infection with S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, S. aureus, or in some cases secondary viral infection with herpes simplex or adenovirus. Studies have demonstrated a marked reduction in measles-associated morbidity and mortality after initiation of childhood vitamin A supplementation.

In addition to cell count, differential, pH, chemistries, Gram stain, and bacterial culture that are routinely obtained, consideration of mycobacterial or fungal disease should prompt appropriate stains and cultures.44 If CXR or the clinical scenario is consistent with TB, then a large volume of pleural fluid (at least 10 mL) should be centrifuged and the pellet examined with acid-fast (and fungal) stains and culture to increase the diagnostic yield. Adenosine deaminase levels in the pleural fluid, pleural biopsy, and tuberculin skin testing may also be considered as potentially helpful in determining the diagnosis.",

These sequelae of \u03b2-hemolytic streptococcal infection continue to be common problems in the tropics. Two-thirds of those afflicted are between 5 and 15 years of age. RHD incidence rates in most developed nations are <1 per 100 000; in Sudan it is 100 per 100 000 and in China 150 per 100 000. Prevalence rates as high as 77.8 per 1000 (in Samoa) have been described and are many-fold higher than in the developed world. The WHO estimates that up to 1% of all schoolchildren in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the eastern Mediterranean may have signs of RHD.62 Pulmonary complaints and fever in the tropics may represent acute rheumatic carditis or bacterial endocarditis complicating prior rheumatic heart damage. Fever, cough, hemoptysis, and dyspnea may lead to misdiagnosis of a primary pulmonary infection. Pulmonary hypertension or congestive heart failure with pulmonary edema due to RHD is not uncommon in impoverished countries, where secondary prophylaxis to prevent recurrent RHD episodes is difficult to administer and valve replacements are unavailable. Consideration of RF is almost forgotten in much of the industrialized world but should be considered in adults who grew up in the tropics and in children who have recently arrived or visited areas of the tropics with significant rates of RF/RHD.",
