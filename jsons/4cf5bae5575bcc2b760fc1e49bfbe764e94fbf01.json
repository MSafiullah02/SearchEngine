All cases were evaluated pathologically and bacteriologically, whereas only 68 cases were examined for the presence of bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), parainfluenza-3 virus (PI-3 virus) and bovine coronavirus, 62 cases for bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVD), 45 cases for bovine adenovirus and 51 cases for mycoplasmas. Based on histopathological examination, the cases were diagnosed as fibrinous and/or necrotizing bronchopneumonia, suppurative bronchopneumonia, embolic pneumonia and others. The diagnoses were based on the dominating and most severe lesions in each lung. Haemophilus somnus, Pasteurella multocida, Actinomyces pyogenes, P. haemolytica and BRSV were the most commonly found bacterial and viral lung pathogens, respectively. Pasteurella spp. and H. somnus were often associated with the more severe fibrinonecrotizing type of bronchopneumonia, whereas BRSV was primarily detected in cases of suppurative bronchopneumonia. Mycoplasma bovis was isolated from one case only, whereas M. dispar, M. bovirhinis and Ureaplasma diversum were present, often concomitantly, in the majority of cases. Aspergillus fumigatus was isolated from one case.",

In brief, tissue from one pneumonic area of the lungs was streaked on to four blood agar plates (Columbia agarbase, Oxoid, Unipath Ltd, Basingstoke, UK; all supplemented with 5 % sterile calf blood) and further onto one plate containing brom thymolblue, 1 % saccarose and 1 % lactose (Drigalsky agar plate). Two of the blood agar plates contained polymyxin B-sulphate 25 units/ml (Sigma, St Louis, USA; P1004). After inoculation, one plate with and one without polymyxin B-sulphate and the Drigalsky plate were incubated in a normal atmosphere at 37\u00b0C, whereas the remaining two blood agar plates were incubated in an atmosphere of 10 % CO 2 and 90 % air at 37\u00b0C. All plates were inspected for growth after 16 h and 40 h. A tentative identification of Haemophilus somnus was based on the growth of tiny white or yellowish-white colonies on plates without polymyxin B-sulphate incubated in 10 % CO 2 , and on no growth in normal air. A final identification was based on negative Gram staining, a positive oxidase reaction, a negative catalase reaction, production of indol and fermentation of glucose. A preliminary identification of Pasteurella multocida and P. haemolytica was based on colony morphology, colour, and possible haemolysis on the plates incubated in a normal atmosphere, negative Gram staining and positive oxidase and catalase reactions. The final identification was performed as proposed by Casals and Pringler (1993) , using Rosco diagnostic tablets (Rosco Diagnostica, Taastrup, Denmark). The identification of Actinomyces pyogenes was based on colony morphology and haemolysis on plates incubated in a normal as well as in a CO 2 -enriched atmosphere (regardless of the content of polymyxin B-sulphate), morphology by positive Gram staining and a negative catalase reaction. Blue colonies on Drigalsky plates were suspected as Salmonella spp., a final confirmation being based on conventional Salmonella serotyping (Popoff and Le Minor, 1992) . The identification of Streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus was performed in accordance with Barrow and Feltham (1993) .",

In brief, a \u00bc 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 cm piece of inflamed lung tissue close to the borderline between macroscopically inflamed and normal parenchyma was minced in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer, homogenized in a Stomacher and centrifuged. The supernatant was used for the detection of virus antigens; in 68 cases for BRSV, PI-3 virus and bovine coronavirus, and additionally, in 45 randomly selected cases for bovine adenovirus. Antigens of BRSV and PI-3 virus were detected using hyperimmune calf sera and of bovine coronavirus by using immunserum from a rabbit, immunized with a rabbit cell culture-adapted strain of bovine coronavirus (Meyling, 1982) . Bovine adenovirus was detected using rabbit antibodies to hexons of Hepatitis contagiosa canis (HCC) adenovirus of dogs. For all ELISA systems, microtitre plates were coated using the specific detection sera. The supernatant from homogenized lung tissue was subsequently applied followed by incubation with biotinylated specific antibodies towards the viral antigen. The binding of peroxidase-conjugated avidin (DAKO P347, Glostrup, Denmark) was visualized by orthophenylenediamine substrate (OPD) (Kem-En-Tec, Copenhagen, Denmark). Threshold levels have been described previously (Uttenthal et al., 1996) . In 62 cases, lung tissue was also tested for the presence of bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVD) by cultivation on bovine turbinate cells followed by specific staining after the principles described by Meyling (1984) .",

In this study, M. bovis was found in only one case, thus indicating a low prevalence in Denmark (Friis and Krogh, 1983) . Only one lung contained fungi (A. fumigatus). Pneumocystis carinii has previously been demonstrated in Danish calf lungs (Settnes and Henriksen, 1989) , but the organism was not found in this study, which indicates that it does not seem to be involved in outbreaks of severe pneumonia in Danish calves. In general, bacteria were often associated with a fibrinous necrotizing type of bronchopneumonia and BRSV with a suppurative bronchopneumonia accompanied by interstitial emphysema. A clear correlation between pathological changes and aetiology could, however, not be established. The reasons for this may be many: intensive antibiotic therapy, the immune status of the calf, variation in virulence between different strains of the same micro-organisms, concomitant infections, false-negative microbiological diagnosis, etc. One likely explanation of major importance for the often negative outcome of bacterial cultivation attempts is probably the frequent appearance of antibacterial substances within the lungs (32 %), reflecting recent antibiotic therapy. Therefore, more work should be carried out in order to enhance the sensitivity of routine screening for bacterial pathogens, for example by the application of concomitant diagnostic tools such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques, the detection of bacterial antigens in tissue extracts, or by immunohistochemistry. In a recent study, the results of the application of a peroxidase-anti-peroxidase technique for the demonstration of H. somnus antigen in pneumonic calf lungs in Denmark revealed a distinct higher rate of infection as compared with cultivation results (Tegtmeier et al., 1995) .",

            "text": "In conclusion, this study demonstrates that some degree of pathological classification of pneumonic calf lungs can be performed, when based on the dominating and the most severe lesions. Also, different pathogens can be associated with the different types of pneumonias, i.e P. haemolytica and H. somnus with fibrinous necrotizing types of bronchopneumonia and BRSV with suppurative changes accompanied by interstitial emphysema on the borderline between inflamed and macroscopically normal tissue.",
