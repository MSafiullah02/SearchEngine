The novel coronavirus was first reported in Wuhan, China, in late December of 2019.3 China issued a lockdown on all major cities to prevent and contain the spread of the virus; unfortunately, it was too late. Sporadic cases began to first appear in Asia, then Europe and the Americas, and finally affecting 208 countries and territories.2",

Stringent protection procedures should be conducted for high-risk procedures such as endoscopy, Ambu bagging, and endotracheal tube intubation.1",
