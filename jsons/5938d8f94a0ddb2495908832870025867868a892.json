We sequenced and analyzed two new PRVC strains, RV0104 (G3), and RV0143 (G6) and compared their pathogenesis with that of the historic strain Cowden (G1) in gnotobiotic (Gn) pigs. Near complete genome sequence analysis confirmed that these two strains were distinct from one another and the Cowden strain. VP1, VP2, VP6, NSP1-NSP3, and NSP5 genes were more similar between Cowden and RV0143, whereas VP3, VP7, and NSP4 shared higher nucleotide identity between Cowden and RV0104. Three-day-old and 3-week-old Gn piglets were inoculated with 10 5 FFU/piglet of Cowden, RV0104 or RV0143, or mock. All 3-day-old piglets developed severe diarrhea, anorexia, and lethargy, with mean PRVC fecal shedding titers peaking and numerically higher in RV0104 and RV0143 piglets on post infection day (PID) 2. Histopathological examination of the small intestine revealed that the 3-day-old Cowden and RV0104 inoculated piglets were mildly affected, while significant destruction of small intestinal villi was observed in the RV0143 inoculated piglets. Consistent with the highest degree of pathological changes in the small intestines, the RV0143 inoculated piglets had numerically higher levels of serum IL-17 and IFN-\u03b1 cytokines and numerically lower PRVC IgA geometric mean antibody titers. Milder pathological changes and overall higher titers of PRVC IgA antibodies were observed in 3-week-old vs. 3-day-old piglets. Additionally, diarrhea was only observed in RV0104 and RV0143 (but not Cowden) inoculated 3-week-old piglets, while levels of serum IL-10 and PRVC IgA antibodies INTRODUCTION Rotaviruses (RVs) infect small intestinal mature enterocytes on the tips of the villi in the small intestines causing diarrhea and destruction of these enterocytes (Estes et al., 2001) . Several mechanisms of diarrhea induction by RVs have been described: malabsorption of fluids and electrolytes that occurs due to the extensive damage to small intestinal villous epithelium, activation of the enteric nervous system induced by neurological dysfunction and the resulting disruption of blood flow due to damaged enterocytes, and the action of RV non-structural protein, NSP4, an enterotoxin that increases intracellular Ca 2+ levels further disrupting fluid homeostasis in infected and noninfected adjacent cells (Ruiz et al., 2000; Estes et al., 2001; Vlasova et al., 2017) .",

Pigs that suffer from RV diarrheal disease exhibit stunted growth, anorexia, lethargy or even mortality, resulting in significant economic losses (Saif, 1999) . Porcine rotavirus group C (PRVC) was first discovered in 1980 (Saif et al., 1980) and is currently recognized as the major single cause of gastroenteritis in neonatal piglets (Marthaler et al., 2014) . Recently, numerous investigators have reported on the increased prevalence of PRVC in swine worldwide (Morin et al., 1990; Martella et al., 2007 , Marthaler et al., 2014 , Moutelikova et al., 2014 . In contrast to RVA, the lack of a robust cell culture (except Cowden G1 genotype; Saif et al., 1988) and its sporadic nature in the past have resulted in limited knowledge on RVC epidemiology, pathogenesis, and immunity. Understanding the pathogenesis of these strains will allow diagnostic tools and preventive measures to be developed, since RVC is increasingly being detected in both animals and humans and interspecies and zoonotic transmission has been confirmed (Saif et al., 1980; Rahman et al., 2005; Amimo et al., 2013; Marthaler et al., 2014; Kattoor et al., 2017; Vlasova et al., 2017) .",

The same genotypes are confirmed as circulating in other parts of the United States and Canada (Marthaler et al., 2013) . The reasons for the increase in the prevalence of PRVC infection and disease in neonatal piglets are not well understood. With the emergence of new PRVC genotypes of unknown pathogenicity, and the lack of effective vaccines, comparative studies are necessary to develop strategies for reliable control and prevention measures. In this study, we comparatively sequenced and evaluated the pathogenesis of the two new PRVC strains, RV0104 and RV0143, and the historic strain Cowden.",

The presence of other enteric viruses that causes diarrhea was screened using RT-PCR. RNA isolated as above was also tested for porcine RVA and porcine RVB using RT-PCR and specific primers as described in Amimo et al. (2013) . Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and porcine deltacoroviruses were detected using conventional PCR as described in Jung et al. (2014) , Vlasova et al. (2011), and Hu et al. (2018) . Furthermore, complete genome sequencing has been performed using Next generation sequencing (NGS) that also confirmed absence of other viral pathogens. To conduct the experiments, small and large intestinal contents (SIC and LIC) of actively infected (7-10 day-old) Gn piglets were pooled, diluted, filtered (as above), and used as viral stock inoculum as noted above for the other PRVC strains. The titers of each inoculum were determined by RT-qPCR using a standard curve that was developed in this study with RT-qPCR of 10-fold serial dilutions of synthetic genes of Cowden, RV0104 and RV0143 (RV0104 VP6 accession # MN809647.1, RV0143 VP6 accession # KC164677.1, and Cowden VP6 accession # M94157.1) and RVC diagnostic primers (Amimo et al., 2013) obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.1710 Commercial Park Coralville, IA, United States. These Gn pig pools were then used for sequencing and to orally inoculate Gn piglets (3-day-old and 3-week-old) . Some piglets were euthanized on post inoculation day (PID) 3 to assess the intestinal pathology, while the rest were euthanized at PID10. The original virulent Cowden, G1 strain (Saif et al., 1980) was serially passaged to maintain virulence in Gn piglets 17 times.",

IL-22 that belongs to the IL-10 family has recently been found to play a critical protective role against viral infections in the mucosal surfaces (Ouyang and Valdez, 2008; Sonnenberg et al., 2011) . IL-22 was associated with the expression of antimicrobial FIGURE 5 | Villous atrophy and structural changes in jejunum and ileum of PRVC (Cowden, RV0104, and RV014) inoculated piglets at PID3. Tissues were preserved in 10% formalin before Hematoxylin and eosin staining. The images were captured using the imaging microscope Olympus B \u00d7 41 with camera Olympus DP72 and Olympus CellSens software at 10\u00d7. defensin proteins and the promotion of tissue barrier in intestinal epithelial cells, protecting against mucosal viral infections (Xue et al., 2017) . We observed that IL-22 was significantly (P = 0.0357) or numerically higher in 3-day-old Gn piglets inoculated with PRVC Cowden or RV0143 but not in the RV0104 or mock Gn piglets. Significantly higher of IL-22 when compared with mock could have contributed to the decreased virus shedding titers observed at peak (PID 2) in Cowden inoculated compared with the RV0104 and RV0143 3-day-old inoculated Gn piglets. IL-22 production and functions are influenced by different cytokines including IL-17, IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, or TNF-\u03b1 (Liang et al., 2006; Eyerich et al., 2009; Guilloteau et al., 2010; Sonnenberg et al., 2010) , most of which were up-regulated in the RV0143 inoculated piglets at variable time-points. Surprisingly, none of those cytokine levels were increased in the Cowden inoculated piglets that had the highest levels of serum IL-22, while all the cytokine levels were intermediate in the RV0104 3-day-old piglets. It is noteworthy that upregulation of IL-22 production alone (seen in Cowden G1 inoculated piglets) may contribute to increased proliferation and survival of intestinal epithelial cells, decreasing virus shedding and alleviating intestinal pathology in neonatal piglets. In contrast, upregulation of IL-22 production in combination with IL-17 (seen in RV0143 piglets) could have enhanced pro-inflammatory signaling, aggravating intestinal pathology (Parks et al., 2015) . IL-10 was higher at PID2 in 3-week-old piglets inoculated with Cowden strain which might have reduced pro-inflammatory mediated diarrhea in these piglets. This coincided with increased PRVC IgA Ab titers in those piglets, which is consistent with the fact that IL-10 promotes B cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation into plasma cells (Rousset et al., 1992) . Jiang et al reviewed data from a variety of RV studies in humans which demonstrated that when RV-specific IgA antibodies are present in serum at elevated levels, they correlate with intestinal sIgA (Jiang et al., 2002) .",

Additionally, both current PRVC strains induced prolonged elevation of IFN-\u03b1 levels in the 3-week-old piglets, in contrast to Cowden strain, in which levels that briefly peaked at PID2 and then declined. Prolonged up-regulation of IFN-\u03b1 responses is consistent with more pro-inflammatory environment and can decrease the antiinflammatory activity of IL-10 (Rousset et al., 1992) . These findings emphasize once again that the pathogenesis of these three PRVC strains in a Gn piglet model differs. TGF-\u03b2 peaked at PID10 in all infected piglets.
