Targeting children is expected to reduce the spread of influenza, offering indirect protection to unvaccinated individuals and non-effectively vaccinated high-risk individuals [4].",

They also need to account for the seasonal variability in vaccine effectiveness and in epidemic size due to the variation in vaccine match and antigenic drift. Dynamic transmission modeling studies were used to inform the decision to introduce an influenza vaccination program in the UK in 2013 for healthy children aged 2\u201316 years using the intranasally administered live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) [6].

Each season, an influenza epidemic unfolds according to an SIR model; the proportion of immunes increases due to infection or vaccination, and it decreases following immunity losses due to antigenic drift (more details are provided in Additional file 1). The model was calibrated to vaccine effectiveness data from the literature and data on laboratory-confirmed influenza cases in the Netherlands over the years 2003\u20132015 and to the reported numbers of visits to a general practitioner (GP) with influenza-like-illness in a Dutch sentinel surveillance network over 11 seasons (2003/2004\u20132014/2015) [10].",

We considered the first 5 years after introduction as a stabilization period to allow adaptation of pre-existing immunity levels to the extended vaccination program and used the results of the seasons 2025\u20132026 to 2044\u20132045 for our analysis; the time horizon of our analysis was 20 seasons. Simulated outcomes on infections were converted to symptomatic cases, GP visits, hospitalizations, and deaths using age-specific and risk-group-specific outcome probabilities. Subsequently, clinical outcomes served as an input for the economic analysis estimating costs and loss of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). As recommended in the Dutch cost-effectiveness guideline [14], the analysis was conducted from a societal perspective. Future costs and QALYs were discounted to the value of the first recorded season of 2025\u20132026 using annual discount rates of 4% and 1.5%, respectively [14].",

The additional vaccination program for healthy children consists of annual vaccinations for children aged 2\u201316 years using the intranasally administered quadrivalent LAIV (Q-LAIV). This age-group covers children attending day care, primary school, or secondary school. A lower limit of 2 years was used because Q-LAIV is contraindicated in children younger than this age [16]. The coverage in healthy children was assumed at 50%; this approximates the average uptake of the Q-LAIV program in England during the 2017/2018 season, being 43% in children aged 2\u20133 years at their GP and 60% in children aged 4\u20139 years at schools [17, 18].

Briefly, the transmission model was informed by Dutch demographic projections from 2015 to 2044 [19], and social contact structures by age and sex class were based on observed contact patterns in the Netherlands [20]. The duration of protection through natural infection is measured with respect to the circulating influenza strains. This parameter was estimated in the model calibration procedure and lasted on average 5.1 years (95% interval 2.9\u20138.2 years) [9]. Vaccine effectiveness of TIV against the circulating influenza strains was on average 45% (95% interval 19\u201366%), and simulated vaccine matches varied by season and decreased with age [21\u201323]. Recent post-licensure effectiveness studies comparing the effectiveness between LAIV and the inactivated influenza vaccine found equivocal results [24\u201326], while a clustered randomized trial found no difference between LAIV and inactivated influenza vaccine on a community level [27]. Therefore, we assumed a similar effectiveness of Q-LAIV and TIV. As the vaccine effectiveness of TIV wanes already within the season, we assumed its duration of protection to last 1 year. No long-term effectiveness data is available for Q-LAIV, but a clinical trial in young children suggests that the vaccine could provide some protection in the second season after vaccination [28]. As live-attenuated vaccines are thought to be less immunogenic than natural infections due to a lower antigen load [29], we assumed in the main analysis that the duration of protection through Q-LAIV lasts 1 year and explored a longer duration of protection in the sensitivity analysis.",

When the price Q-LAIV increased from \u20ac3.79 to \u20ac10.71 or further to \u20ac19.32, the average ICER increased to \u20ac7070 or \u20ac10,850 per QALY gained, respectively. In contrast, exclusion of indirect healthcare costs in life-years gained had high impact on the ICER. For this scenario, the childhood vaccination program was found to be cost-saving. Assuming a shorter life expectancy for prevented influenza deaths aged 70 years and older decreased the QALYs gain as well as the indirect healthcare costs in gained life-years, resulting in an average ICER of \u20ac700 per QALY gained.",

This approach has been used in modeling studies where transmission models were fitted to the observed long-term dynamics [44\u201347]. The effect of including different influenza types and subtypes is straightforward when assuming independence between them. In Additional file 3, we show simulation results where we calibrate the model to only observational data of A/H3N2. This results in a longer duration of protection as compared to the analysis that used all influenza types and subtypes. The resulting dynamic patterns are similar to the analysis that used all influenza types and subtypes: introducing childhood influenza vaccination leads to an infection attack rate that is on average lower, but the number of seasons with large epidemics is higher. Therefore, we do not expect the specific modeling choices with respect to the multiple influenza types, subtypes, and strains to affect our conclusions.",

Similar results were obtained for the model that focused on influenza A/H3N2 (Additional file 3). A longer duration of protection by Q-LAIV does not affect the increase in variability in epidemic size because vaccinated children will also be vaccinated in the next season (which seems most common in practice); only children that leave the program at 17 years of age benefit from a longer duration of vaccine protection. Only when vaccination provides full protection, childhood influenza vaccination is expected to reduce the variability in epidemic size.

This threshold of 5% was based on the Netherlands 2017/2018 season, in which hospitals reported to have difficulties managing bed and staff capacity due to a high number of elderly cases requiring hospitalization combined with increased sick leave among qualified staff [42]. A symptomatic attack rate of 5% is 2.8 (5/1.78) times higher than the average symptomatic attack rate we estimated for the current program, and the use of a lower threshold would increase the proportion of simulation in which childhood influenza vaccination leads to an increased frequency in seasons with large epidemics. To deal with more frequent and higher peaks in healthcare demand during influenza epidemics, hospitals would need to increase their capacity. Furthermore, an increased strain on the healthcare system may cause substantial outbreak costs, such as impaired treatment outcomes or canceled routine surgeries. Factoring these costs into our analysis would decrease the likelihood of childhood influenza vaccination being cost-effective.",

However, there are no clear guidelines how this risk should be weighed. Most preventive measures that are considered in cost-effectiveness analyses have a risk of a net health loss close to 0%; hence, a 6% probability of a net health loss for the entire vaccination program in this modeling study is remarkable. A well-known example of a preventive measure with a high risk of health loss is the introduction of a rubella vaccination program: at intermediate vaccination coverage, the population risk of congenital rubella syndrome is higher than it would be without a vaccination program [60]. This has been dubbed a \u201cperverse outcome of mass vaccination\u201d [61]. In the past, the Netherlands has been very careful in avoiding such a perverse outcome [62].",

It also suggests there is merit in future analyses of available observations in populations with substantial influenza vaccine coverage in children over multiple years. As the roll-out of the childhood influenza vaccination programs in the UK has not been completed yet, it is currently too soon to see any such effects. The USA, where the influenza vaccination coverage in children has been in the range of 50 to 60% over the last decade, might provide an interesting population for such analyses. Although not necessarily explained by the implementation of childhood influenza vaccination, we observed that the USA encountered in 2017/2018 the largest seasonal influenza epidemic across all age groups since 2003/2004 [63, 64]. A proper analysis requires regions that differ in vaccination coverage for children but are otherwise comparable.",
