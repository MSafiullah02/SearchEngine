The unit is not yet an approved medical device and is in the concept and prototyping stage. It is presented here to invite fast feedback for development and deployment in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

In particular this is the case for ventilators, which are needed during COVID-19 related treatment at onset, during the intensive care phase and during the very extended recovery times. Companies are scaling up production [4] , but this will not be sufficient to meet the demand according to the current forecasts. There is a wide spectrum of devices, ranging from highly sophisticated through to simpler units [5] , [6] useful in the milder phases of illness. There is already a large number of proposals circulating for devices which can be quickly manufactured cheaply and on large scale [7] - [12] .",

The proposal here is, at this stage, not a medically approved system and will need a process of verification with medical experts.

This will include: PRVC (Pressure Regulated Volume Control) mode, SIMV-PC (Synchronised Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation); and in addition a basic mode of operation: CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure). The HEV design also provides PEEP (Positive End-Expiratory Pressure), which is not a ventilatory mode in itself but is designed to support steady low positive pressure to the lungs. The PRVC mode, which is standard for commercial ventilators, aims to set the tidal volume at the lowest possible airway pressure. In the case where the tidal volume is not achieved at a particular pressure setting, due to changes in the patient's airway resistance or lung compliance; this can then be gradually adjusted. SIMV-PC mode will allow the patient to take spontaneous breaths, and will assist the breathing when the spontaneous breath is taken. This mode uses an additional sensor for the detection of the negative pressure initiated by the patient breath. If the patient respiratory rate does not achieve the target value, additional mechanical ventilation is provided by the unit.",

Note that the ventilator design outlined here is not intended to replace the high-end devices needed for the most intense phase of treatment, but should be appropriate and useful in the hospital environment for milder symptoms or long term care and recovery.",

The unit takes as input the standard compressed or mixed air supply available in hospitals, in such a way that one supply could be connected to several units. We expect that typically the pressure supplied will be between 2 and 5 bar. The connections presented by the unit to external input/outputs will follow hospital standards. The supply pressure is reduced by a pressure regulator to approximately 200 mbar. The system concept is based around a buffer volume of approximately 2 litres. The filling of this buffer is controlled by the input valve (valve in). By controlling of the opening time, one can achieve the desired target pressure in the buffer after which the valve (valve in) is shut. This buffer filling occurs during the expiratory part of the breath cycle. If the buffer pressure is within tolerance of the required pressure, the output valve (valve out) is then opened, initiating the respiratory cycle. The respiratory rate, inspiratory time (corresponding to the open time of valve out) and pause time are all controllable. If a PEEP pressure is set, then the pressure in the lungs will have the minimum of the PEEP pressure.",

Based on the experience with operating the demonstrator, the desired physical characteristics of the pressure regulators, valves and pressure sensors could be refined, and the system is now in prototyping stage.
