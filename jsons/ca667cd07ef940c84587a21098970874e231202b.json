WHO declared H. pylori as a carcinogen of first order because of its potential to enhance the risk of stomach carcinoma and MALT lymphoma in long-term infection. In highprevalence regions for H. pylori, the frequency of stomach carcinoma is significantly higher compared to low-endemic areas (Correa et al. 1990 ). The identification of H. pylori facilitates curative treatment of most associated diseases in individuals.

Transmission of H. pylori occurs mainly in childhood. In western developed countries the overall prevalence is around 30%, higher in older age groups due to a cohort effect, and this increases with low socioeconomic status (Rothenbacher et al. 1989 ).
