However, 87% of the patients with SARS also show decreases in of the CD8+T cell level, in contrast to the findings for patients with HIV infection. In general, the adaptive immune response to viral infections occurs by means of the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response. CTLs are generated in response to an invading pathogen, and they specifically recognize and kill virus-infected cells and/or release inhibitory antiviral soluble factors [12, 13]. Therefore, CD8+ T cell counts should be sharply increased in patients with SARS. The mechanism of reduction of CD8+ T cell counts in patients with SARS needs further investigation.",
