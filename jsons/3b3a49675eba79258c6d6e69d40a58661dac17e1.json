In the absence of a vaccine and specific antiviral treatment, the containment of the pandemic relies mainly on the rapid identification and isolation of COVID-19 patients (2) . In addition to chest computed tomography (CT-scan), this strategy is based on the availability of real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to be performed on any suspect patient presenting specific symptoms (3) . These symptoms being similar to those of the seasonal flu, it is currently not possible to test all patients with flu-like symptoms due to the lack of resources and available diagnostic tests. As mentioned in the audio interview of the New England Journal of Medicine on the 19th of March 2020 (2) , the importance of establishing the correct diagnosis is central to giving the appropriate care to COVID-19 patients.",

Thanks to the results from previous research on SARS-CoV, the nucleoprotein was identified as the best target for a sensitive diagnostic sandwich assay using monoclonal antibodies (5) (6) (7) . All monoclonal antibodies were initially generated using full-length SARS nucleocapsid protein (NP) and were subsequently tested with SARS-CoV-2 NP. The NP sequence for generating the antibody is reference AY291315.1 in Genbank (cfr. Supplementary Table 1 ). The SARS-CoV-2 shares a high similarity with bat coronaviruses, and the known SARS-CoV of the 2002-2003 epidemic (8) provided the opportunity to use previously developed reagents for developing a rapid diagnostic assay able to also detect the new SARS-CoV-2. The diagnostic technique consists of an anti-SARS-CoV capture antibody fixed onto a nitrocellulose strip and a labeled anti-SARS-CoV antibody migrating with the buffer and the sample.",

Add 100 \u00b5L of the LY-S dilution buffer to reach a dilution ratio of 1:2. The LY-S dilution buffer consists of TRIS buffer containing EDTA, NaN3 (<0.1%), a detergent and blocking agents. Cap the tube with the stopper. Stir thoroughly to homogenize the solution. Open the tube. Immerse the strip in the direction indicated and close the tube with the stopper. Allow to react for 15 min and read the result. Regarding interpreting the results, for a negative test result, a reddish-purple line appears at the Control line (C) position (upper line). No other band is present. For a positive test result, in addition to a reddish-purple band at the (C), a visible reddish-purple band appears at the Test line (T) position. The intensity of (T) may vary according to the quantity of antigens found in the sample. Any reddish purple line (T), even weak, should be considered as a positive result.

All samples were NPS in a viral transport medium (3 mL UTM). The analysis protocol with the COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip was as follows: Of the 20 positive patient samples with a cycle threshold (CT) below 25, 10 of them were analyzed in duplicate; of the 20 weakly positive samples with CTs between 25 and 37.7, all were analyzed in duplicate; and of the 20 negative patient samples, 10 of them were analyzed in duplicate.

Looking at all patients in the clinical performance study, the majority of the positive test results had a high viral load: 66.7% of all positive test results had a CT value below 25. Shi et al. mention that the severe respiratory symptomatic stage is associated with high viral load (4) .",

It is not clear whether the false positive sputum (N = 1/10) from the cystic fibrosis patient was due to a matrix effect, its high-viscosity or the presence of S. aureus. Taking these factors into account, sputa from cystic fibrosis patients with higher viscosity and multi-pathogenic presence might lead to an unacceptable level of false positivity. Whether cystic fibrosis patients should be excluded from analysis with the COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip and directly receive a diagnosis with qRT-PCR is not clear but could be judicious as long as we lack further evidence. Overall, at this stage, sputum should be avoided with the COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip because false-positive results cannot be excluded with this sample type. Further investigation using fresh nasopharyngeal specimens should clarify why we found one false-positive ICT, whether due to the matrix effect of the viscous sputum or due to S. aureus infection. It is worth mentioning that the majority of clinical S. aureus specimens (N = 9/10) did not give false positive results. An additional limitation in the methods of this study was the absence of a MERS sample for a cross-reactivity study with another member of the betacoronavirus genus. Furthermore, the developed assay has some flaws as it does not differentiate between SARS-CoV-1 and 2.",

It should be noted that this clinical validation was performed on leftover sample material after qRT-PCR analysis with a delay of 1 h to 2 days and conservation at 4 \u2022 C. The delay between sample collection and antigen test processing, as well as the dilution of the sample in the transport media, may have impacted the sensitivity of the assay. As tested with four clinical samples (stored at 2-8 \u2022 C), the intensity of the reaction slightly diminished after 24 h. Further sample storage studies have to be conducted in the near future. In our population, we did not see any difference between NPS and NPA. Because recently published data report high viral loads in nasopharyngeal, mid-turbinate and nares specimens, we can infer that the ICT could also have an acceptable sensitivity for such specimens.

Thanks to its specificity of 99.5% and its high PPV of 98.7%, patients with a positive antigen test result could receive immediate care, while antigen test-negative patients will need a CT-scan for triage and the qRT-PCR result for confirmation of SARS-CoV-2.

Even if the cost of the COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip test is far lower than the cost of molecular diagnostic methods, the budget impact should be studied within a larger health economic frame. A health economic assessment should question whether a CT-scan would still be needed for triage and taking into account the time gain for the implementation of biosafety measures when an early positive result of a COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip will help the clinician at the emergency area entry to redirect his/her patient faster, without the need to perform a CT-scan.",

First, in Belgium, the legal framework has not yet been published for designating the responsibilities of healthcare workers using POCT outside the hospital environment. A proposal for a legal framework has been drafted, closely relating the GP to a clinical laboratory to guarantee traceability within a recognized quality management system and the certification of competent users after training. Second, regarding the biosecurity rules for handling COVID-19suspicious respiratory samples and the absence of a Biological Safety Cabinet Class II designation at a given GP's office, the GP should possess all necessary protection materials, such as a container for biohazard waste, sterile gloves, disposable gowns, safety goggles (or face shield) and an FFP2 medical mask. Third, in this study, we did not record how many COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strips resulted in weak intensities for the control and test lines. However, in our user-friendly study, the observers mentioned a source of error when reading weakly positive COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strips due to the difficulty in visualizing the color line through the closed tube. When better visualization of the strip-with good light (such as with crystal tubes)-is not available, the lab technician sometimes has to open the test tube in the laminar air flow cabinet and remove the strip with forceps. This type of operation would never be acceptable in a GP environment. At this point, the design of the device is a strip within a closed reaction tube, but R&D will continue to improve its maturity with the perspective of a closed cassette including closed sample handler-enhancing visualization of the test line and a reduction of the risk of user error in the interpretation of the results. Then, a pilot study should evaluate the applicability of the COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip as a POCT device at GP offices to report the performances obtained in a relevant environment with the intended users.",

One could consider that in conjunction with public health authorities, isolation measures could eventually be focused on those outpatient individuals with a positive COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip result. Especially in a subpopulation with a high pretest prevalence, this could become a tool for managing lock-down situations.

TL was also involved in the development of this test and as CEO of Coris Bioconcept he has a potential conflict of interest. On the other hand, the validation as described in the analytical performance study, the clinical performance study and the risk management have been done completely independent from Coris BioConcept, without any conflict of financial interest. All scientific investigators that are external to Coris BioConcept declare having no conflict of interest. Coris BioConcept has offered the reagents for validation and after CE-certification, some kits for diagnosing the homeless people suspected with COVID-19 in Brussels.The remaining authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Mertens, De Vos, Martiny, Jassoy, Mirazimi, Cuypers, Van den Wijngaert, Monteil, Melin, Stoffels, Yin, Mileto, Delaunoy, Magein, Lagrou, Bouzet, Serrano, Wautier, Leclipteux, Van Ranst, Vandenberg and LHUB-ULB SARS-CoV-2 working diagnostic group.
