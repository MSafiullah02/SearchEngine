The most common cause of olfactory disorders are sinonasal disorders, which are defined as secondary smell disorders caused by diseases/pathologies in the nose/paranasal sinuses. According to the literature, sinonasal disorders represent-depending on the examined population-up to 72% of all olfactory disorders. In general, noninflammatory and inflammatory disorders are differentiated. Inflammatory disorders can be further classified into infectious or noninfectious disorders, both forms in which olfactory disorders can be present. For the clinician examining patients, the exact classification of the olfactory disorder is mandatory in order to choose appropriate treatment and counseling. Among the most common inflammatory disorders are acute rhinitis, allergic rhinitis, post-upper respiratory tract infection and chronic rhinosinusitis, which are discussed in detail. In contrast to nasal inflammation, only little is known about oral inflammation and its psychophysical effects on taste function. Taste disorders following oral inflammation are briefly discussed.",

            "text": "Acute rhinitis is a common, usually selflimiting primarily viral nasal inflammation. Among the most common viruses are rhinovirus, respiratory synticial virus, adenovirus, coronavirus, and influenza and parainfluenza viruses. Three pathophysiological phases are distinguished: a prodromal phase (white, pale mucosa), a catharactic phase (mucosa red, swollen, hypersecretion), and a viscuous phase (thickening of secretion, decrease of symptoms). Although acute rhinitis is among the most common causes of olfactory disorders, 4 there is little known about functional changes. In their experimentally induced common cold study, Akerlund et al. 5 observed an impaired olfactory function correlating with nasal congestion, suggesting a relationship between olfactory function and nasal congestion but not between olfactory function and nasal discharge. In another experiment, Hummel et al. 6 the Sniffin Sticks Test and observed an increase of olfactory threshold and a decrease of N1 amplitudes in recordings of olfactory event-related potentials even when the nasal obstruction and discharge was controlled by the application of oxymetazoline. 7 These results imply that the observed olfactory changes in acute rhinitis may be independent of nasal congestion. Because the disease is self-limiting and olfactory function usually recovers, patients rarely seek medical advice concerning the smell disorder during acute rhinitis. When the acute rhinitis subsides and the olfactory disorder persists, it is called a \"postviral olfactory disorder\" or an olfactory disorder \"post-upper respiratory tract infection\" (post-URTI).",

Symptoms of rhinitis include rhinorrhea, nasal obstruction, nasal itching, and sneezing, which are reversible spontaneously or under treatment. It is subdivided into \"intermittent\" or \"persistent\" disease. The severity of allergic rhinitis can be classified as \"mild\" or \"moderate-severe.\" 15 Although olfactory disorders are not part of the definition, they can be present-often temporarily-in up to 23% of the cases. 16 In patients with pure allergic rhinitis-seasonal or perennial-without any signs of accompanying sinusitis or nasal polyposis, olfactory disorders are less severe than in patients suffering from other forms of rhinitis. 17 A decrease in olfactory threshold after allergen exposure has been shown to be related to hypersecretion. 18 A clinical examination typically shows mucosal swelling, mostly in the lower turbinate, hypersecretion, and with ongoing disease and increasing disease duration, a reddening of the mucosa as a sign of the inflammatory processes in the mucosa. However, the visibility of the olfactory cleft and olfactory function do not correlate. 19 Topical steroids are used to treat allergic rhinitis and its effect on olfactory function remains contradictory. In studies testing olfactory function, two studies described an improvement in either olfactory identification 20 or threshold 21 whereas another study found no improvement in olfactory function at all. 22 Because the olfactory disorder is mostly temporary, it is usually not the main symptom making the patient seek medical advice.",

            "text": "This definition according to the European Position paper on Rhinosinusitis and Nasal Polyps 23 includes olfactory disorder as a symptom, which reveals that olfactory disorder is a very common symptom in this entity, especially in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), which is defined as a disorder lasting more than 12 consecutive weeks. 24 Although CRS is a very common disease, its exact etiology still remains unclear. Therefore, the exact pathophysiology of the accompanying olfactory disorder is difficult to determine. It is tempting to classify the olfactory disorder in CRS with polyps as conductive alone. This hypothesis was supported by the fact that (1) these deficits rapidly improve after oral steroids; (2) the olfactory epithelium was believed to be an \"immunological privileged\" site incapable of mounting a normal immune response to foreign proteins; and (3) biopsies revealed at least some normal appearing olfactory receptor neurons. 25 Recent evidence has shown, that at least partly, olfactory disorders are caused by an increase in olfactory receptor neuron apoptosis due to an extensive caspase-3 activity in CRS. 26 From the clinical point of view, it is important to remember that up to one-quarter of patients with CRS are unaware of their decreased olfactory ability. 27, 28 Together with the fact that subjective disturbance and measured olfactory function in patients only show a moderate correlation, 29 olfactory testing is mandatory especially prior to surgical intervention. The clinical endoscopic picture is diverse; polyps, mucous discharge, mucosal reddening and swelling, and purulent discharge may be present. Once again, the visibility of the olfactory cleft from an endoscopic view and olfactory function do not correlate. Psychophysical test results reveal alternations between hyposmia and anosmia because olfactory disorder develops slowly and therefore only a portion of the affected patients are aware of the disorder. 30, 31 So far no study in these patients has been able to document an association between olfactory test scores and intranasal airway access factors whether measured by rhinomanometry, acoustic rhinometry, or rhinoscopy. On the other hand, there seems to be growing evidence that the severity of histopathological changes in the olfactory mucosa, which can be seen in CRS, seems to be correlated with decreased olfactory function. 32",

During the acute phase of the inflammation, patients usually suffer from pain and the taste disorder is one minor problem among others. As the oral mucositis decreases the consecutive xerostomia becomes apparent. At this stage, usually 1-2 months after therapy, taste function is still reduced and the patients especially noticed a reduction of the perception of bitter and salty quality. 35 The disorder can persist up to 2 years. 35 Studies using confocal microscopy have shown that after radiotherapy, taste pores are covered with epithelia cells, which might be one of the reasons why taste function is reduced. 36",
