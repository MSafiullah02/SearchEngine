            "text": "Bluetongue is one of the major infectious diseases of ruminants and is caused by bluetongue virus (BTV), an arbovirus transmitted by Culicoides spp. (1\u20133). BTV is a member of the Orbivirus genus within the Reoviridae. The double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) genome of BTV is composed of 10 segments encoding seven structural (VP1 to VP7) and four nonstructural (NS1 to NS4) proteins (4, 5). The BTV virion is an icosahedral particle assembled in a triple layer of capsid shells (6, 7). The viral core contains linear dsRNA genomic segments associated with replication complexes formed by three minor proteins, VP1 (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase), VP4 (capping enzyme including methyltransferase), and VP6 (RNA-dependent ATPase and helicase) enclosed by layers of VP3 (subcore) and VP7 (core) (4, 6, 8, 9). The outer capsid is formed by two structural proteins, VP2 and VP5, that are responsible for cell attachment and entry (10\u201312). NS1, the largest of the nonstructural proteins, forms tubules in the cytoplasm of BTV-infected cells and is a positive regulator of viral protein synthesis (13\u201315). NS2 is a major component of viral inclusion bodies (VIB) which are the sites of BTV morphogenesis and RNA replication (16\u201318). NS3, the only BTV glycoprotein, is involved in virus exit from infected cells and is thought to play a role in counteracting the innate immune response of the host cell (19\u201321). The recently discovered NS4 is the smallest of the BTV proteins, and it also confers a replication advantage in cells in an antiviral state (5). At present, there are 26 different BTV serotypes circulating worldwide. The serotype is determined predominantly by VP2, which is the most variable of BTV proteins and a main target of neutralizing antibodies (22\u201325).",

The virus emerged in 2006 in an area between the Netherlands, Belgium, and northern Germany and then spread throughout the continent, causing high mortality in naive sheep flocks and, occasionally, also clinical disease in cattle (34\u201336). Interestingly, no clinical signs were detected in sentinel sheep when the virus reached northern Italy and Sardinia in 2008. Experimental infections with the northern European strain of BTV8 (BTV8NET2006) and the Italian strain of BTV8 (BTV8IT2008) confirmed a marked reduction in the virulence of the latter virus (33).

Similarly, in vitro passage of BTV was shown to have an impact on virulence in vivo (37\u201339). In particular, strains isolated from severe clinical cases and consequently adapted to mammalian tissue culture have been reported to have reduced virulence in experimentally infected animals (33, 38). Interestingly, a decrease in pathogenicity was shown to occur even in minimally passaged strains and was attributed to a genetic bottleneck that occurs after a single passage in mammalian cells rather than to mutations in the consensus sequence (33). Conversely, live attenuated vaccines and tissue culture-adapted strains of BTV with a history of multiple passages in vitro show increased accumulation of nucleotide substitutions correlating with increasing numbers of passages in mammalian cells (39). Genomic segments 1, 2, and 8 (Seg1, Seg2, and Seg8, respectively, encoding VP1, VP2, and NS2) were shown to be consistently mutated in high-passage-number strains of BTV2, BTV4, and BTV9 viruses and to be attenuated in murine models of bluetongue (39).",

Four monoreassortants showed reduced mortality in IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 3A). In particular, BTV8L+S2H and BTV8L+S10H caused no mortality in mice at an inoculation dose of 300 PFU and caused 40% mortality with 3,000 PFU. Full attenuation using both inoculation doses was achieved with double reassortants BTV8L+S1/2H (which contains Seg1 and Seg2 of BTV8H), BTV8L+S2/6H, and BTV8L+S2/10H. These data suggest that VP2 and NS3 primarily, in addition to VP5 and VP1, were major factors of BTV8H attenuation in this mouse model. We next aimed to identify the minimal number of BTV8L segments that would restore full virulence to a reassortant based upon the BTV8H backbone (Fig. 3B). None of the single or double reassortants was virulent in IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice. Furthermore, BTV8H+S1/2/6/10L also possessed an attenuated phenotype. These data suggested that other viral proteins besides VP1, VP2, VP5, and NS3 play a role in the virulence of BTV8L. To achieve 100% mouse mortality at an inoculation dose of either 300 or 3,000 PFU, it was required that at least five proteins of BTV8H be replaced by the BTV8L equivalents, including either VP4 or VP7 in conjunction with the aforementioned VP1, VP2, VP5, and NS3 (Fig. 3B).",

Therefore, we performed viral replication kinetic assays in CHO cells and in a derived cell line (pgsA-745) deficient in xylotransferase and thus lacking heparan sulfate GAGs. rgBTV8L and a BTV8H reassortant with the VP2 of BTV8L (BTV8H+S2L) grew equally well in both cell lines.

In light of these data, we wanted to establish whether rgBTV8L, rgBTV8H, and the rgBTV8L/rgBTV8H reassortants were better or worse equipped to overcome restriction in cells already in an antiviral state prior to infection. For these experiments, we used CPT-Tert cells as they do not produce IFN but can respond to IFN treatment (5, 40). We pretreated CPT-Tert with either 1,000 units of UIFN or control medium for 18 h prior to infection with rgBTV8L, rgBTV8H, and monoreassortants with a BTV8L backbone at an MOI of 0.01. At 48 h p.i. supernatants of infected cells were collected and titrated by endpoint dilution analysis. Comparison of viral yields in cells treated and untreated with UIFN showed that the replication of all viruses was inhibited by at least 100-fold by UIFN (P < 0.001) (Fig. 8). The reduction in yield of rgBTV8L in UIFN-treated cells compared to that in untreated cells was approximately (5 \u00d7 103)-fold. Strikingly, this ratio was more than a millionfold (1.7 \u00d7 106) for rgBTV8H. In UIFN-treated cells, most reassortants reached yields similar to those obtained by rgBTV8L under the same conditions. A notable exception was BTV8L+S4H, which had yields 10-fold lower than those of rgBTV8L (P < 0.05) in the UIFN-treated samples. BTV8L+S2H showed the highest degree of inhibition in treated CPT-Tert cells among all 10 monoreassortants. However, the yield of BTV8L+S2H in treated cells was equivalent to the one obtained by rgBTV8L under the same conditions.",

In this study, we aimed to map the molecular determinants of virulence of the northern European strain of BTV8. We found that nonsynonymous mutations in four segments (Seg1, -2, -6, and -10) encoding VP1, VP2, VP5, and NS3 contributed to the attenuation of BTV8 in vivo in IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice. Reassortants where segments encoding the VP2 or NS3 of the attenuated rgBTV8H were used in the context of the virulent rgBTV8L backbone caused no mortality in mice inoculated at the lower dose (300 PFU) used in this study. The combination of Seg2 with either Seg1, Seg6, or Seg10 of rgBTV8H in the context of the rgBTV8L backbone resulted in a fully attenuated reassortant that was nonpathogenic at either the low or high doses.",

Interestingly, Seg2 with either Seg1, Seg6, or Seg10 of rgBTV8L did not restore virulence in the rgBTV8H backbone. The fact that a degree of virulence in rgBTV8H was achieved only after combining Seg7 with Seg2, Seg6, and Seg10 of rgBTV8L might suggest that interactions between specific viral proteins (or genomic segments) could play a role in the pathogenicity of BTV. Both VP2 and VP5 have previously been shown to interact with VP7 trimers in BTV virions (52). Additionally, other studies demonstrated the importance of NS3 interactions with outer capsid proteins in virus trafficking and assembly (19, 53). It is therefore possible that while mutations in high-passage-number VP5 or VP7 did not directly affect the functions of these proteins, they did influence virus virulence through their interactions with VP2 and NS3.",

This external and highly exposed area of VP2 was also implicated in attachment to a host cell receptor, and the mutations that arise in this region could be due to the changes in affinity for binding to specific ligands (10). Cryo-electron microscopy showed that VP2 possesses a sialic acid binding region located in its hub domain, which is one of two sites suggested to interact with the cell surface receptor (10). An increased affinity for GAGs has often been cited in the context of tissue culture-adapted strains (47, 56\u201358). Here, we found that BTV8H or reassortants with the VP2 of BTV8H had, indeed, a greater affinity for GAGs and were attenuated in IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice. Previous studies have shown that viruses acquiring mutations conferring a higher affinity for heparan sulfate proteoglycans are often attenuated in vivo (58\u201362).",

IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice, due to the lack of expression of the type 1 IFN receptor, are a suitable tool to study determinants of viral virulence unrelated to IFN expression (39, 67, 68). However, it is most likely that other viral factors that are used to counteract the IFN system contribute to BTV virulence. Pathogenicity studies of multiple reassortants in sheep are not feasible; hence, we used primary OvEC as an in vitro surrogate model to identify the genome segments that confer higher sensitivity to the cell-autonomous IFN response. BTV8H (and its derivative rescued by reverse genetics) replicated poorly in primary cells. These data showed that the IFN response played a role in the inhibition of BTV8H replication. Both BTV8L and BTV8H induced similar amounts of IFN in infected primary cells. These data suggest that primary OvEC sense and respond to infection with both viruses in a similar manner but that BTV8L was able to counteract this response better than BTV8H.",

            "text": "Most of the BTV8L monoreassortants containing BTV8H genomic segments were able to replicate to similar titers as the parental low-passage-number virus in primary cells. Two notable exceptions included BTV8L+S4H and BTV8L+S9H. However, the VP4 (encoded by Seg4) of BTV8H also influenced the viral phenotype in IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice, suggesting that mutations in this protein could also have affected its functions unrelated to the type I IFN response. VP4 of BTV acts as a capping enzyme, and therefore the mutations in VP4H and, in particular, the mutation in the amino acid residue at position 332 of the predicted 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase (2\u2032 OMTase) domain could have an adverse effect on the efficiency of viral mRNA capping (69, 70). Moreover, recent studies have shown that viral mRNA that lacks 2\u2032-O-methylation at its 5\u2032 cap structure induces a more potent innate immune response through MDA5 activation or direct interactions with proteins members of the IFIT (interferon-inducible protein with tetratricopeptide repeats) family (71\u201373). An inefficient capping mechanism would therefore explain the slight, yet consistent, decrease in virus yields reached by BTV8L+S4H in IFN-deficient CPT-Tert cells and the more pronounced growth inhibition in OvEC. This hypothesis was further supported by comparing the growth kinetics of monoreassortants in the BTV8L backbone in CPT-Tert cells either untreated or pretreated with UIFN. Of all reassortants, BTV8L+S4H showed the lowest yields in UIFN-pretreated cells, which suggested that VP4H was one of the proteins contributing to the inability of rgBTV8H to replicate in cells primed with IFN. These data are in concordance with other studies showing that West Nile virus, coronaviruses, and poxviruses mutants with deficient 2\u2032 OMTase activity were not able to escape IFIT-2 induced restriction in cells stably expressing IFIT-2 (72). It is therefore possible that through viral mRNA capping, the VP4 of BTV8 could play a role in evading host restriction factors in order to allow the virus to replicate in host cells in an antiviral state.",

We are not aware of viral helicases being involved in interactions with the innate immune system.

This indicated that mutations in segments other than Seg4 and Seg6 contributed to the restricted replication of the high-passage-number virus. Altogether, these data reinforce the concept that passaging viruses in an environment with no constraints from the IFN system allows greater flexibility of the viral genome, which in turn leads to the emergence of viruses with optimal replication efficiencies. The mutations that arise under such conditions might not necessarily involve major IFN antagonists but can involve proteins that are normally fine-tuned to evoke a minimal immune response while allowing sufficient (yet suboptimal) transmission in the natural host (74). A recent study looking into interserotype determinants of BTV pathogenesis in sheep showed that replacement of BTV1 Seg2, -6, and -10 with homologous BTV8 segments resulted in reassortants that showed a similar phenotype in sheep as BTV8 (51). However, this study was performed using BTV1 and BTV8 serotypes that are both virulent in sheep. Consequently, a clear distinction between levels of pathogenicity of the parental viruses and their reassortants was difficult to assess.",

More studies aimed to map the molecular determinants of BTV virulence, using different strains/serotypes and experimental systems, will help to build an intellectual framework to characterize thoroughly BTV pathogenesis.
