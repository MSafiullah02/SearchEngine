Its newest definition is defined as organ dysfunction due to infection, which remains a major public health concern that is associated with poor clinical outcomes (in-hospital mortality is more than 10%) and substantial healthcare expenditures [1]. Data showed that the cost of medical care for sepsis patients was more than $20 billion (5.2%) of total US hospital costs in 2011 [2]. Although the accurate incidence of sepsis is unknown, the reported data are increasing [3, 4], and conservative estimates indicate that sepsis is a leading cause of mortality in the US hospitals and critical illness in the world [5, 6].",

Recently, it is recognized that the initiation and cessation of immune and inflammatory responses is an initiative and symphony process. The pathogenesis of sepsis is intricate. The early stages of sepsis are characterized by excessive generation of inflammatory mediators; however, as sepsis develops into severe chronic sepsis, immunosuppression dominates. This demonstrates that excessive uncontrolled inflammation and inappropriate immune response characterize sepsis [7]. The new lights into sepsis contribute to the explanation of failure in current treatment strategies, including inhibition of the activation phase of the acute inflammatory response to infection (e.g. glucocorticoids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and anti-TNF-\u03b1 drugs) [8]. Therefore, it\u2019s urgent and beneficial to explore new paradigms in managing sepsis.",

The synthetases include cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LOX) and cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase. The SPMs can further be subdivided into lipoxins, resolvins, protectins, maresins and immunoresolvents (RvTs, PCTRs and MCTRs) (Fig. 8.1) [9\u201312].\n",

Hence, the productions of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2) and chemokines are inhibited, and the downregulation of inflammation-initiating eicosanoids (prostaglandins and leukotrienes) is promoted. This as well regulates the leukocyte infiltration and stimulates the macrophage efferocytosis of apoptotic cells and debris [10, 11]. Recent studies have shown that the SPMs exhibit beneficial impacts at the site and in course of sepsis while maintaining the homeostasis between the abundance of microorganisms and the host. In this chapter, we aim at:The functions of SPMs in sepsis.Because aspirin partakes in the synthesis of lipoxins and resolvins, studies related to aspirin-triggered lipid mediators are included [13].Protective effects of carbon monoxide (CO) on inflammation and its impacts of enhanced productions of pro-resolving lipids [14, 15]. Therefore carbon monoxide and its synthetase HO-1 are summarized.Since Annexin (A1) is a stress response protein, the current evidence for beneficial pro-resolving effects of this mediator in sepsis is also addressed in this chapter [16].\n",

In general, lipoxins are potent inhibitors of inflammatory activity, inducing the resolution of leukocyte activity. They block the response to leukotrienes and chemotactic factors such as leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and platelet-activating factor [19]. These effects inhibit the infiltration of pro-inflammatory cells. The resolution of inflammation involves reduction of neutrophil recruitment, promotion of macrophage migration and augmentation of apoptotic cells efferocytosis.

With the inoculation of Klebsiella pneumoniae in mice, pulmonary sepsis occurred and induced LXA4 and FPR2/ALX expression in the lung. Later, the treatment of receptor antagonists and inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase and 15-lipoxygenase in early sepsis (1 h postinfection) even increased leukocyte migration to the infected tissues, and survival rate increased. On the contrary, receptor agonist and LXA4 application consequently worsened early infection and reduced migration of leukocytes. But, 24 h postinfection, LXA4 improved animal survival. Here, this research demonstrates the dual role of LXA4 and highlights the time dependence when targeting the LXA4 pathway in pulmonary infection [28].",

The first member of this family, termed as maresin 1 (MaR1), exhibits potent phagocyte-directed actions that include inhibition of neutrophil infiltration and stimulation of macrophage efferocytosis by dihydroxyl products in this pathway [10, 49, 50]. In a murine model of ARDS, lipid mediator metabololipidomics discovered that MaR1 was temporally generated and regulated in vivo. Early intravascular MaR1 was organ-protective, and MaR1 production was dependent on platelet-neutrophil interactions leading to reduced lung neutrophils, oedema, tissue hypoxia and inflammatory mediators [51].",

Each of these molecules activates the host immunity in a dose-dependent manner for bacterial clearance and counter-regulates the production of pro-inflammatory molecules including endothelin-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and inflammatory eicosanoids. Moreover, concentrations of RvTs in peripheral blood increased rapidly after exercise (a self-resolving inflammatory state) in healthy volunteers and were significantly higher in patients with sepsis than in healthy subjects. These results indicate that RvTs biosynthesis occurs in a coordinated manner in correlation with acute activation of the immune response.

PCTRs are derived from DHA through 15-LOX-mediated pathways in leukocytes. Since PCTRs actively promote the termination of bacterial infections by stimulating the uptake and killing the bacteria as well as the repair and regeneration of damaged tissues, these mediators are immunoresolvents [73]. PCTRs parallelly promote a macrophage phenotype shift, downregulating the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-\u03b1 and IL-8 and increase the production of regenerative molecules including TGF-\u03b2 [74].

CO is produced by the constitutively expressed heme oxygenase-2 (HO)-2, and by HO-1, which is upregulated upon cellular stress. HO-1 catalyses the degradation of heme to biliverdin, CO and iron (which binds to ferritin), all acting as anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory agents [76]. Endogenously formed CO acts as a signalling molecule and induces antioxidant genes [76, 77]. CO downregulates inflammatory prostaglandins and thromboxanes. On the other hand, it enhances the expression of lipoxygenases which are key synthetases of SPMs [15]. Resolvins and lipoxins in turn upregulate HO-1 in macrophages demonstrating mutual amplification of these two pro-resolving pathways [15]. CO contributes to active pathways on the elimination of microorganisms, promote killing of bacteria and enhance their clearance by macrophages in a protective manner [78]. Furthermore, pro-inflammatory cytokines including TLR2, -4, -5 and -9 are repressed, while anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 are initiated by CO in macrophages [79]. Enhanced endocytosis of apoptotic cells by efferocytosis is also known [15].",

In Annexin A1-null mice models of inflammation, treating with anti-Annexin A1 antibodies or antisense constructs of Annexin A1, have confirmed that Annexin A1 exhibits as an endogenous regulator of anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving as well as a mediator of GC action [89, 90]. Annexin A1, binding to FPR in the innate immune system, exerts general suppressive activities including the reduction of the amounts of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids molecules generated and the release of histamine and preformed cytokines from mast cells. In contrast, ANX-A1 may induce the release of pro-resolving mediators, such as IL-10. Furthermore, Annexin A1 highly downregulates PMN migration into inflammatory sites and accelerates their apoptosis, while the migration of monocytes into inflammatory sites is promoted by Annexin A1 which eventually transform the microenvironment into a resolving procedure [92]. In an in vivo experiment, the absence of Annexin A1 or its major receptor (FPR2) amplifies greatly the duration and intensity of acute and chronic inflammation. Consequently, the acute anti-inflammatory actions of GCs are greatly reduced or even abrogated. Conversely, human recombinant Annexin A1 and peptides derived from the N-terminal domain can rescue this phenotype and exert high anti-inflammatory and pro-resolution effects in many models of inflammation [90, 92].",

Given, the potential anti-inflammatory and pro-resolution benefits of these SPMs (including CO, HO-1 and Annexin A1) mentioned above, endogenous or exogenous supplement of these mediators analogues or natural extracts may be a new paradigm in treating sepsis.",
