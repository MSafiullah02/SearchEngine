            "text": "The threat to global health from viral infections, such as COVID-19 [1], influenza, HIV, hepatitis, Zika, chikungunya, Ebola etc., has brought into sharp focus the need for rapid, sensitive and selective detection of viruses as well as post-infection antibodies. In particular, halting the severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2013related coronavirus-2 (SARS\u2013CoV-2) pandemic depends critically on the use of diagnostic testing on an immense scale. In-community testing could successfully identify cases enabling contact tracing and containment without lockdowns [2]. A particular challenge is to identify infected, but asymptomatic individuals (incubation phase), and to measure the extent of live virus shedding so as to enable isolation to end at the earliest safe time [3]. The speed of this testing process could be significantly increased using Point Of Care, POC, devices that would allow testing to be carried out in the community [4]. Blood based commercial POC nucleic acid and immunoassays for COVID-19 are rapidly emerging. While fluorescence based detection dominates these devices (approximately 85% of 76 assays that have received emergency use clearance by the Food and Drug Administration of the USA at time of writing), some electrochemical approaches have been developed. For example, those based on electrochemiluminescence and changes in the rate of electron transfer to a redox active probe in solution upon binding of the target. However, achieving the required performance, especially with respect to selectivity, e.g., high false positive rate for antibodies due to past exposure to the common cold coronavirus rather than SARS-CoV-2, has proven challenging for some devices. Current knowledge suggests the detection of SARS\u2013CoV-2 and its associated antibodies is not significantly different than other viruses. This observation suggests that accelerating the deployment of these devices may have impacted on the usual processes of characterisation, verification and validation. Under these time constraints, validation is especially challenging, i.e., the monitoring of specifications that will consistently produce results fit for purpose. This part of the product development cycle is crucial to assuring that a high test sensitivity (the ability to correctly identify those with the disease, true positive rate) and test specificity (ability to correctly identify those without the disease, true negative rate), are achieved. Moreover, the analytical sensitivity may not be adequate for early detection, or for confirming non-communicable levels of disease post-infection. The development of POC devices for high performance viral and antibody detection is clearly a very challenging goal [5]. For example, sample collection should be minimally invasive, e.g., nose/throat swab or saliva, rather than blood. The concentration of virus present can be very low especially early in the disease cycle when testing is most effective at preventing community transmission, placing extreme demands on analytical sensitivity. The sample to answer time needs to be short, ideally less than 20 minutes. This mini- review reports on virus and antibody detection using electrochemical methods, focusing on recent key innovations that drive the development of portable, high performance point-of-care technologies [6].",

Nanomaterials and nanocomposites, can increase the surface area so that more bioreceptors, e.g., antibodies or nucleic acid capture strands, can be immobilized giving a wider dynamic range and perhaps increasing the sensitivity [17]. Significantly, the porosity of these materials can be controlled so that the relatively large (2k to 500 kdaltons) target can access a large fraction of the immobilised bioreceptors. As shown in Figure 1\n, Han et al. used this strategy for the detection of influenza H1N1, H5N1, and H7N9 viruses [12]. In this case, ZnO nanorods were grown in PDMS to give a higher density of immobilized antibodies. This system produced an LOD of 1 pg/mL, a linear dynamic range between 1 and 10 ng/ml and a good ability to discriminate between the individual viruses. However, further testing with real samples would be needed to demonstrate its real world performance.",

Somewhat unusually, the selectivity of the response was investigated by adding potentially interfering viruses such as dengue virus, chikungunya virus and Nile West virus only after adding the ZIKV target. However, under these circumstances the addition of the interferences did not significantly change the impedance. The shelf-life was investigated which is critically important for successful real-world implementation and generally deserves more attention in the literature. Significantly, the results confirm that the sensor is stable for 30 days when stored at 4 \u00b0C, but beyond that time the magnitude of electrochemical response reduced significantly.",

Other potential advantages include small sample volumes (noting that when the target analyte is low, there is a minimum volume of sample required so that a detectable quantity is present), reduced reagent use and small physical size [24]. Within the context of the Internet-of-Things, IoT, data generated can be uploaded to the cloud for meta-analysis [25], e.g., close to real-time outbreak tracking and hospital consultant assessment. These approaches are especially applicable to low resource environments where the hospital system is less well developed which is especially relevant to the current COVID pandemic [26].

The quality of the final analysis is highly dependent on the sample preparation which is particularly challenging for complex samples such as blood, saliva, urine and even breath condensate. These samples contain a significant number of interferences, e.g., proteins, antibodies, DNA, cells etc., that can interfere with the detection of the target analyte. Fundamentally, there are two limiting approaches to achieving a selective response. First, the target analyte can be isolated and pre-concentrated using an instrumental approach, e.g., magnetic nanoparticles. For example, separating plasma from whole blood can help to minimise interference [28] noting that some approaches could induce in vitro haemolysis that could interfere with the analysis [29]. A recent interesting innovation was superhydrophobic plasma separators [30]. Second, the selectivity of the bioreceptor with the target, e.g., the difference in association constant of an antibody for the target relative to interferences, can be maximised. This can be achieved through antibody selection and by carefully controlling the local microenvironment within the immobilising film so as to maximise the association constant.",

The peak height ratio and threshold time depend directly on the DNA concentration.

Despite the latest advances in camera technologies that give smartphones increasingly sophisticated imaging capabilities, electrochemical detection continues to have significant advantages including design simplicity, physical robustness, low power needs, ease of integration within microfluidic devices, excellent analytical sensitivity, and low instrumentation costs. Recent outbreaks of respiratory illnesses in humans including MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) viruses highlight the need for rapid, sample-to-answer, point-of-care devices that can be deployed in the community. As discussed here, the use of novel nanomaterials, labels, advanced instrumentation, and sample clean-up/nucleic acid amplification using microfluidics continue to drive improved sensitivity. The COVID-19 case poses particular challenges to the POC diagnostics industry. The massive scaling of testing (approximately 23 per 1000 population in OECD countries) has been achieved predominantly using PCR based, centralised laboratory testing rather than POC devices. Moreover, in many countries the sample-to-answer time has decreased significantly to the point where it can play a useful role in contact tracing. Thus, reliable, high throughput testing within a centralised laboratory is continuing to play the central role in containing the pandemic. The major opportunity for POC devices may now lie in identifying recovered patients who have an appropriate antibody profile to confer immunity to re-infection. Given the issues with validation of device performance so far, it appears likely that the successful POC devices will be adaptations of current, highly successful antibody based detection devices. Looking further forward to improving testing performance, including speed, reliability, and accuracy, as well as using minimally invasive samples such as saliva or exhaled breath, schemes, such as the NIH Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx), will play important roles. Significantly, these networks will include experts in technology, regulatory approval, commercialization, and manufacturing so as to accelerate progress. While being increasingly considered, issues, such as ability to handle the diverse properties of real-world samples, shelf-life, cost of goods, adoption by end users, cost effectiveness and mass manufacturability, need to be considered early in the device development life cycle.",
