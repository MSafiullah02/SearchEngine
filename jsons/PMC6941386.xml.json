            "text": "The present systematic review reveals that AKI and use of RRT is common in ICU patients with burn injuries. Patients with high age, chronic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, high TBSA percent burnt, high ABSI score, inhalation injury, rhabdomyolysis, surgery, high APACHE II score, high SOFA score, sepsis, and need for mechanical ventilation are at risk for post-burn AKI. Development of AKI after burn has a negative impact on short-time morbidity and mortality, but we lack data on long-term patient outcomes and economic consequences. Limited data suggests that most survivors of AKI regain their kidney function.",
