            "text": "Respiratory viruses are among the most common causes of human morbidity and mortality worldwide, especially for infants and young children [1, 2]. The rapid identification is important for both therapeutic and infection control purposes. Diagnoses of viral respiratory tract infection have been performed generally by non-molecular approaches such as direct immunofluorescence and viral culture. They are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often lack sensitivity or specificity. In the last few years, multiplex RT-PCR assays have been developed to detect respiratory viruses, and many of them have been commercialized, such as xTAG RVP, RVP fast (Luminex Molecular Diagnostics, Toronto, Canada), Resplex II (Qiagen, Mississauga, Canada), FilmArray\u00ae Respiratory panel (Idaho Technology Inc., Salt Lake City, UT, USA), Anyplex\u2122 II RV16 and Seeplex RV assays (Seegene, seoul, Korea), AdvanSure\u2122 real-time RT-PCR (LG Life Science, Seoul, Korea) [3\u20137]. However, many of these assays are costly, or require specialized laboratory equipment [8, 9].",

The overall detection rate of the two-tube assay for each virus was comparable to those of the Luminex xTAG RVP Fast assay and Seeplex RV15 ACE assay, demonstrating the high sensitivity and specificity of the two-tube assay in the analysis of clinical samples [10]. However, two-tube assay has a few drawbacks, such as the size difference of some amplicons are not big enough leading to the difficulty in judging the results by untrained staff, the hands-on two-tube assay is till cumbersome and the internal control is not steadily detected, which limits its wide use in the routine screening in provincial and local Center for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) in China. In the present study, we adopted the two-tube assay as a reference, and have been progressively optimized and substantially improved the performance of simultaneous detection of thirteen respiratory viruses types/subtypes, the most frequently detected viral agents of respiratory tract infections documented by Beijing Monitoring Network for Pneumonia between 2012\u20132014 (unpublished data), in a single-tube assay while maintaining excellent sensitivity and specificity. The targeted 13 respiratory viruses types/subtypes including influenza A virus (FluA), influenza B virus (FluB), seasonal influenza A virus subtypes H1N1 2009 pandemic (09H1N1), seasonal influenza A virus subtypes H3N2 (sH3N2), parainfluenza virus type 1 (PIV1), human rhinovirus (HRV), adenovirus (Adv), parainfluenza virus type 2 (PIV2), parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV3), parainfluenza virus type 4(PIV4), respiratory syncytial virus A (RSVA), respiratory syncytial virus B (RSVB) and human metapneumovirus (HMPV).

In this study, we compared the performance of a single-tube multiplex reverse transcription PCR assay with the reference method, a two-tube assay, which has been confirmed to be comparable to the commercial Luminex x TAG RVP Fast assay and Seeplex RV15 ACE detection kit in our previous study. The single-tube assay is also based on the QIAxcel capillary electrophoresis system, which is accessible in most of provincial Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in China. Of the 310 specimens from hospitalized children, a high prevalence of infection and co-infection with the common respiratory viral pathogens were revealed. HRV was found to be most frequently, followed by PIV3. The major discrepancies between the reference two-tube assay and the proposed single-tube assay were the detection rates of HRV, Adv, HMPV, PIV4, PIV1 and PIV3. The 24 viruses detected only by the single-tube assay (5Adv, 4HMPV, 3HRV, and 2PIV1, 9PIV3, 1PIV4) were confirmed by sequencing as true positives. Therefore, the single-tube assay is more sensitive than the two-tube assay for the detection of HRV, HMPV, Adv, PIV, PIV3 and PIV4. The overall detection rate of the single-tube assay for each virus was comparable to that of the two-tube assay (kappa>0.75) demonstrating the high sensitivity and specificity of the single-tube assay in the analysis of clinical samples.",

            "text": "Compared with the two-tube assay, the single-tube assay revealed better sensitivity, more accurate quality control, less nonspecific amplification, more cost-effective and shorter turn-around time. This improvement might be attributed to several aspects as follows. First, we have replaced human genome RNase P gene in the two-tube assay with bacteriophage MS2 as an internal control. The utility of MS2-based armored RNA as an assay internal control has been documented in many clinical applications [13, 14]. In this study, the internal control MS2 was added to each specimen prior to extraction as an exogenous control to monitor the whole process from nucleic acid extraction to RT-PCR. Second, we inserted a few T nucleotides when appropriate between the specific and universal sequences in the primer design to ensure each amplicon can be easily distinguished by the QIAxcel machine. Third, homologous tail sequences was added to the 5' end of each chimeric primer [15]. The homo-tag assisted non-dimer (HAND) system introduced in this study was to prevent dimer formation and allow more, specific, sensitive, and stable detection of the viruses [16]. Fourth, for detection of multiple viral targets, simultaneous presence of multiple targets in one specimen may have led to competitive inhibition of amplification of less abundant targets and may explain some loss of assay sensitivity. In this study, we avoided this problem by optimizing temperature switch PCR parameters and further fine-tuning the concentration of primers. In addition, single-tube assay is more convenient and rapidly to apply to clinical specimens, saving the cost and turn-around time.",

In this study, the samples collection time is not in winter (May to October). Second, HRV is a well-recognized cause of common colds and associated with upper respiratory tract complications. In this study, the patients were hospitalized for both the upper respiratory tract and lower respiratory tract infections.",

The different geographic location might also lead to the different seasonal distributions of PIVs. All of the FluA positives detected by the single-tube assay were subsequently sequenced to be H3N2 infection. 09H1N1 were not detected by either of two methods because H3N2 is the predominant seasonal FluA circulating in 2015 in China. Though PIV2 and 09H1N1 were not found in the samples, we detected a few stock clinical samples previously identified as 09 H1N1 or PIV2 using both single-tube and two-tube assays, and the results demonstrated both assays worked very well (data not shown). Moreover, no false positives were found by the single-tube assay, further suggesting the high specificity of the single-tube assay.",
