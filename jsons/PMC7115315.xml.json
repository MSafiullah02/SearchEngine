Before he was admitted to this hospital, he had been diagnosed as having cytomegalovirus hepatitis and had received treatment at a local hospital in Hangzhou in April 2010. He was taken by his parents to visit a doctor at the outpatient clinic of the children's hospital on May 3, where he was initially diagnosed as having infant hepatitis syndrome. On May 5, the child was admitted to the children's hospital with the diagnosis of neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis and was kept at a ward (room X, zone 10) in the gastroenterology department. However, the child developed a fever and started to cough on May 25. On the following day, red maculopapules were found on his face and trunk, and white spots were found on his oral mucous membrane. His body temperature became normal on May 28. He was diagnosed clinically as having acute bronchitis, measles, and neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis in a consultation on May 29. He started to recover on June 5 and was discharged from the hospital on June 7 (Fig 1, Fig 2\n).",

This child developed diarrhea with fever up to 39.4\u00b0C and was admitted to the gastrointestinal department of the children's hospital with the diagnosis of enteritis and infective eczema on May 6.

He successively received anti-infective treatment with aztreonam and symptomatic treatment. Then, he was transferred to room X, zone 10 to share the ward with child A on May 13 (Fig 1, Fig 2).",
