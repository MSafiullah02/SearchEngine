            "text": "Toroviruses within the family Coronaviridae are spherical, oval, elongated, or kidney-shaped enveloped viruses that possess a positive-sense single-stranded, polyadenylated RNA genome of approximately 25\u201330 kb in length (Cornelissen et al., 1997, Horzinek, 1999, Snijder and Horzinek, 1993). Toroviruses have been detected in normal horses as well as in humans, cattle, pigs, and recently in turkeys with diarrhea (Ali and Reynolds, 2000, Beards et al., 1986, Duckmanton et al., 1997, Duckmanton et al., 1998a, Kroneman et al., 1998, Woode, 1994). The first report of toroviruses described the identification of an unclassified virus from diarrheic calves (Woode et al., 1982), which is now known as the Breda virus, or bovine torovirus (BToV). Fecal shedding of the BToVs have been reported in diarrheic calves in several countries including the United States (Hoet et al., 2002, Hoet et al., 2003a, Hoet et al., 2003b, Woode et al., 1982, Woode et al., 1985), Canada (Duckmanton et al., 1998a), Costa Rica (P\u00e9rez et al., 1998), Netherlands (Koopmans et al., 1991), Germany (Liebler et al., 1992), Hungary (Matiz et al., 2002), Austria (Haschek et al., 2006), Japan (Ito et al., 2007), and South Africa (Vorster and Gerdes, 1993). However, there are no reports of BToV infections in South Korea. Since the molecular analysis of the BToV has only been carried out in North American, European and Japanese BToV strains (Cornelissen et al., 1997, Draker et al., 2006, Duckmanton et al., 1998b, Gonz\u00e1lex et al., 2003, Haschek et al., 2006, Hoet et al., 2002, Hoet et al., 2003a, Hoet et al., 2003b, Ito et al., 2007, Smits et al., 2003), it is unclear if the BToVs circulating in other countries have distinct genetic characteristics. This paper reports the detection of BToV shedding in diarrheic calves using RT-PCR and nested PCR, along with the genetic diversity of the BToV strains based on a partial BToV membrane (M) gene.",

Table 3\nshows the sequence relationships of the nt and aa of the partial M gene among the torovirus strains. Interestingly, a comparison of the nt and aa sequences among the BToVs revealed all the Korean BToVs to share 100% nt and aa identity to each other, except for the K96 strain (99.0% nt and 98.8% aa identity). In order to eliminate cross contamination, the negative control for RT-PCR and nested PCR was used when the field diarrheic fecal samples were analyzed by RT-PCR and nested PCR. However, there was no positive reaction detected in this negative control. Therefore, this identical nt and aa sequence homology of the M gene among the Korean BToVs might be due to the fact that the positive fecal samples used for DNA sequencing originated from the same county, Muan, even though they had been sampled from different farms at different times (Table 2, Table 3). The Korean BToVs shared higher nt and aa sequence homology to the Japanese BToVs (98.5\u201399.5% nt and 98.5\u2013100% aa identity) and the Dutch BToVs (98.3\u201399.3% nt and 99.3\u2013100% aa identity) than the Italian (96.6% nt and 99.3\u2013100% aa identity) and American (96.6% nt and 98.5\u201399.3% aa identity) BToVs. In addition, the BToVs including the American, European, Japanese and Korean BToVs had a lower nt and aa identity to the equine torovirus strain, Berne (43.2\u201344.9% nt and 9.8\u201310.5% aa identity), than to porcine toroviruses (78.2\u201381.2% nt and 88.9\u201391.1% aa identity). From these results, the Korean BToVs were more closely related to the Japanese and Dutch BToVs than to the American and Italian BToVs. In addition, the overall nt and aa sequence homology of the BToV M gene in this study is higher than of the spike (S) protein gene (Ito et al., 2007, Koopmans and Horzinek, 1994). The relative conservation of the M protein of all BToVs suggests that the structural constraints on this protein are stern, resulting in more limited evolution of this protein than the S protein (Koopmans and Horzinek, 1994). Therefore, future studies will be needed to generate more information on the genetic diversity by including other parts of the genome particularly the S gene as well as including the fecal specimens from other regions in South Korea.",

Other Japanese and Dutch BToVs made separate branches. In addition, the American Breda and the Italian B6 strains clustered on a separate major branch, suggesting these were the most distantly related to the other known BToV strains. Phylogenetic analysis of the aa sequence did not show any significant classification of the BToVs because the homology of the aa sequence among the BToV strains was higher than that of the nt sequence (data not shown). This data supports the above mentioned hypothesis that the Korean BToVs were more closely related to the Japanese and Dutch BToVs than to the American and Italian BToVs. South Korea imports live cows mainly from countries in North American and Oceania, not from Japan and European countries. Hence, the similarity in phylogenetic data on the Korean BToV with the Japanese and Dutch BToVs is quite surprising. Therefore, continuous monitoring and intensive studies will be needed for a more detailed characterization of the BToV with other genes.",
