            "text": "Horizontal transmission refers to all types of infection of an organism by another organism, i.e. the transmission of a pathogen between hosts of a generation. This includes the homologous transmission of a virus from person to person, as well as the heterologous transmission from animals to humans (zoonosis) and vice versa. Pathogens spread by horizontal transmission in a population during epidemics, pandemics or endemics. This can be directly, for example, by virus-containing aerosols or droplets that are released when sneezing or coughing during infectious diseases of the upper respiratory tract (such as infections with influenza viruses, coxsackieviruses, adenoviruses and paramyxoviruses; 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_14, 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_15, 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_16 and 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_19), or indirectly. Indirect transmission is known, among others, for rhinoviruses (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_14), which are transmitted by droplet infection, and also via contaminated hands, doorknobs or similar household items commonly used by infected and uninfected people such as towels. Dirt and smear infections contribute especially to the dissemination of virus-induced gastrointestinal or renal diseases. Here, the pathogen is excreted in the faeces or urine, and is transmitted by contamination with this material because of inadequate hygiene. Canine parvovirus has been spread very efficiently worldwide by the soles of shoes which were contaminated with viruses from dog excrements. In regions with a low hygienic standard, sewage is discharged untreated into rivers and seas. This practice and also fertilization of plants with human faeces, which is widespread in some countries, can lead to contamination of food with polioviruses, enteroviruses, hepatitis A viruses (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_14) and caliciviruses (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_14) \u2013 an important cause of epidemics. Mussels thrive particularly well in such polluted waters and simultaneously enrich hepatitis A viruses. Hantaviruses and arenaviruses (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_16 and 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_16) are excreted in the faeces of infected rodents, and thus are disseminated into the ground. In the case of contact with such contaminated earth, there is a risk of infection with the relevant pathogens. Similarly, organ transplants can lead to transmission of such viruses and also herpesviruses (Epstein\u2013Barr virus or cytomegalovirus; 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_19). In the worst case, all viruses which have a more or less pronounced viraemic phase or are situated in the organ at the time of graft removal can be transmitted by transplants. In fact, lymphocytic choriomeningitis and rabies have been transmitted in this way (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_15 and 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_16). Many viruses are present in the saliva and can be transmitted to babies by kissing or mouth-to-mouth feeding. In other cases, the virus is present in the semen or the cervical secretions and can be transmitted by sexual intercourse. This is particularly true for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), papillomaviruses and some herpesviruses (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_18, 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_19 and 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_19). Viruses that are present in the blood during the disease (hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses, HIV, parvovirus, cytomegalovirus), are transmitted by smeared blood, for example, perinatally during the birth process from the infected mother to the neonate, but also through contaminated blood products or stored blood (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_14, 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_18, 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_19 and 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_20).",

After reproduction in ticks or insects, the virus can be transmitted to other organisms through biting or stinging. This form of heterologous transmission is found, for instance, in yellow fever virus, dengue virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, togaviruses and orbiviruses, and in some bunyaviruses (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_14, 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_14, 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_16 and 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_17). On the other hand, rabies virus enters the wound and thus the organism through the bite of infected vertebrates (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_15). The geographic distributions of viruses that are transmitted by arthropods are mostly identical to those of the mosquitoes and ticks that they use as vectors. Shifts and changes in climate conditions, as are to be expected because of global warming, can lead to the occupation of new regions and niches by insects and the viruses that are associated with them.",

The concept of iatrogenic infection refers particularly to the spread of pathogens by medical procedures such as organ transplants and blood transfusions, and by improperly performed medical interventions, such as the use of contaminated equipment, syringes or needles. Iatrogenic transmissions have frequently been observed in bovine leukaemia virus infections in which the virus was transmitted through the use of insufficiently disinfected needles from animal to animal and from flock to flock.",

Similarly, this also applies when the viral genome is inherited by the next generation as an integrated part of the genetic information of the cell (e.g. of the egg or sperm cell). This vertical transmission from parents to offspring is known primarily for endogenous retroviruses (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_18) or for bovine and porcine pestiviruses (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_14).",

            "text": "Where viruses reside in the time between their epidemic occurrences is often unclear. Sporadic cases of apparent infections occur repeatedly; in such cases, the virus is probably transmitted by healthy people with asymptomatic (inapparent) infections. Some viral species are able to survive in the environment for considerable time before they infect their hosts again; these include parvoviruses and rotaviruses (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_17 and 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_20), picornaviruses (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_14) and also poxviruses (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_19). Even now, poliovirus is occasionally reintroduced from countries that are not free of poliovirus infections (e.g. India and several African countries), and it proliferates in sero-negative people until a developing herd immunity or specific outbreak-control vaccinations eliminate the virus from the corresponding population. In contrast, other pathogens such as rubella virus and most paramyxoviruses (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_14 and 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_15) are instable in the environment, and do not infect animals. They are completely eliminated from the organism by the immune system during the course of infection. Only little is known concerning their whereabouts during the periods between sporadically occurring infections or epidemics. The first appearance of such a viral species must have been linked to human urbanization because such a virus would disappear from small, isolated human populations; therefore, it must be a phylogenetically relatively new virus, which could maintain its infection chains only in populations with a relatively high density. The term \u201cemerging virus diseases\u201d includes infectious diseases in which the viruses have been transmitted to a new host (such as SARS coronavirus; 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_14) or appear again as re-emerging viruses after long periods of time, as is the case for some hantaviruses (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_16).",

            "text": "In contrast, herpesviruses show a completely different behaviour. They remain latent in the body after infection, and the lifelong latency with recurrent excretion phases facilitates the dissemination of the virus even after long intervals (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_18 and 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_19). HIV infections also appear clinically unnoticed for a long time, although in this case infectious viruses are always present in the blood. The same applies to viruses that produce persistent infections and are present over long periods in the blood and are excreted or released from the skin, such as hepatitis B virus, adenoviruses and papillomaviruses (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_19, 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_19 and 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_19). Therefore, they are considered as one of the phylogenetically old viruses, which are well adapted to humans and can survive even in small populations. However, the new highly sensitive methods for detection of viral nucleic acids show that, besides these forms of chronically persisting or latent infections with relapsing recurrence or reactivation, there is also latency of viral genomes in which neither reactivation of the viral genetic information nor the associated synthesis of virus products is observed. This DNA latency in the cells of different tissues has particularly been described for parvovirus B19 (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_20).",

            "text": "Sometimes, viruses infect certain animal species, and these are used as reservoirs for these pathogens, whence they can be transmitted to humans on certain occasions, or accidentally. Influenza viruses infect various bird species, which excrete them in the faeces. They can be transmitted to swine, just as the human virus types. In the case of double infections in swine, genome segments of both virus types can be recombined. In this manner, new reassortants of influenza viruses arise, which are occasionally pathogenic for humans and can spread pandemically in the population (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_16). Other viruses can bridge larger periods by having long incubation times. These include rabies viruses, which use foxes, badgers and bats as reservoirs. In this case, human infections represent the end of the infection chain, and a further dissemination is generally not possible (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_15). Even other viruses are able to leave their natural reservoir, and can be transmitted to humans: different animal poxviruses, hantaviruses, Ebola virus, the pathogen of Lassa fever and flaviviruses, including tick-borne encephalitis virus (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_14, 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_15, 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_16, 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_16 and 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_19).

            "text": "The currently predominant viral infections are the result of evolutionary processes between hosts and parasites which have taken place over very long time periods. Frequently, viral species related to human pathogens are found in various animal species. It is thought that these have adapted to humans during their evolution to become human pathogens, which remain permanently in the population after a certain period of time. If they are highly pathogenic for humans, then they will eliminate themselves from the population by destroying their hosts immediately. Therefore, the ideal situation is a balance between survival of the host and a more or less optimal viral replication with minimal damage. Examples for the optimal adaptation to a host are some arenaviruses (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_16), among them lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and the causative agent of Lassa fever. Both viruses are highly adapted to their hosts, namely wild mice. These viruses are transmitted vertically during pregnancy to offspring, in which they induce an immune tolerance. These animals are healthy virus carriers, and excrete large amounts of viruses for life. However, if they infect humans, this frequently leads to severe diseases. Occasionally, new viral infections emerge in humans. This is particularly the case when contact occurs with rare and reclusive species which transmit the adapted pathogens to humans. An example in this context is the SARS epidemic of 2003. It is assumed that bats are the animal species that serves as the natural host of this very dangerous virus for humans (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_14). Other examples are human Nipah and Hendra infections, which are also transmitted by bats. Poliomyelitis was also a relatively well adapted human virus infection under living conditions with low hygiene standards. Here, the pathogen was usually transmitted during the first 6 months of life. Protective maternal IgG antibodies are still available in the infants at this time. Sequelae from the disease and occasionally paralysis are found only in infections occurring at an older age (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_14).",

According to these criteria, many viruses cannot be characterized as pathogens of the infectious diseases caused by them, not least because many viruses cannot be propagated in cell culture.

They assess the association of a pathogen with a disease, even using indirect criteria. Essential aspects of the Evans postulates are summarized in Table 11.1.\n",
