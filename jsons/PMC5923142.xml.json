            "text": "Human norovirus (HuNoV), a member of the Caliciviridae family, represents a major cause of acute viral gastroenteritis worldwide in both children and adults (1, 2). HuNoV infection can lead to severe dehydration and diarrhea, especially in the elderly or immunocompromised patients (3). The considerable economic burden incurred as a result of norovirus infections, which includes productivity losses and the burden on health care systems, highlights that HuNoV infection is a global economic problem (4). Although there is a significant unmet medical need for the prevention and treatment of HuNoV infection, no licensed vaccines or antivirals for HuNoV infection are currently available. The lack of a robust cellular system for the analysis of viral replication has hampered antiviral research against HuNoV infection for many years (5). This situation has been changed by the recent development of enterocytes derived from stem cell and B cell culture systems (6, 7). Proof of concept that these cell culture systems enable the evaluation of the antiviral effects of compounds against HuNoV has recently been demonstrated (8), but neither of these systems is suitable for large-scale screening of therapeutic compounds. In contrast, while replicon cells lack many features of an authentic viral life cycle because the viral capsid protein has been replaced with a drug resistance marker, they have been widely used for the evaluation of the activities of antivirals against HuNoV (9\u201311).",

            "text": "HuNoV belong to three genogroups, genogroup I (GI), GII, and GIV, which are further subdivided into numerous genotypes, and GII genotype 4 (GII.4) norovirus strains have been circulating worldwide since 2012 (12, 13). Murine norovirus (MNV) is included in GV of norovirus (14). The HuNoV genome is composed of three open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1 encodes the nonstructural polyprotein, which is cleaved into at least six proteins and several stable intermediates by the viral protease NS6 (15). ORF2 and ORF3 encode the major capsid protein VP1 and the minor capsid protein VP2, respectively. HuNoV, similar to other RNA viruses, has a high mutation rate that allows rapid viral evolution due to the error-prone nature of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (16, 17). This potentially permits the emergence of drug-resistant viruses during the course of treatment. In order to overcome this, the development of antiviral drugs for HuNoV infection requires both potent antiviral activity and a high genetic barrier to the generation of drug-resistant viruses, especially during treatment for persistent infection in immunocompromised patients. Information on drug resistance would facilitate drug design and would be useful for predicting and suppressing the appearance of drug-resistant viruses. To date, however, the efficiency with which resistance occurs and the mechanisms by which resistance to inhibitors might arise have yet to be described for any inhibitors against HuNoV. Therefore, we sought to examine whether resistant replicons could be identified following prolonged culture in the presence of a suitable antiviral. To achieve this aim, we utilized rupintrivir (AG7088), an irreversible inhibitor of the human rhinovirus (HRV) 3C protease. Rupintrivir has been reported to inhibit the replication of the Norwalk virus replicon in the hepatocellular carcinoma cell line Huh-7, but whether resistance can be generated remained to be determined (10). In the present study, we isolated replicon cells with reduced susceptibility to rupintrivir after several passages in the presence of rupintrivir and identified two amino acid substitutions of alanine 105 to valine (A105V) and isoleucine 109 to valine (I109V) in the viral protease. Moreover, we demonstrated that these substitutions are involved in susceptibility to rupintrivir using a previously described cell-based fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay (18). Finally, we determined that recombinant MNV with a single I109V substitution in the protease showed reduced susceptibility to rupintrivir in cell culture. We concluded that mutations around the norovirus protease active site lead to the generation of rupintrivir resistance; however, some of these mutations appear to compromise viral fitness, at least in the context of the MNV infection model.",

            "text": "To confirm the previously reported inhibitory effects of rupintrivir on human norovirus replication (10), we generated a human gastric adenocarcinoma cell line, HGT-NV, which stably maintained a Norwalk virus replicon encoding the neomycin resistance gene in place of the major capsid protein. The effects of rupintrivir on norovirus RNA replication in the replicon cells were evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR). Rupintrivir reduced the levels of replicon in a dose-dependent manner with a 50% effective concentration (EC50) value of 1.3 \u00b1 0.1 \u03bcM and showed low cytotoxicity (50% cytotoxic concentration [CC50], >100 \u03bcM), which gave a calculated selectivity index (CC50/EC50) of >77 (Fig. 1A). To determine the concentration of rupintrivir sufficient to completely eliminate the norovirus replicon from HGT-NV cells, we treated the replicon cells with 2.5, 5, and 10 \u03bcM rupintrivir in the absence of G418 for up to 12 days. The replicon cells were passaged on days 3, 8, and 12, and the levels of replicon RNA were quantified by qRT-PCR. A rapid reduction of replicon RNA levels was observed in the cells treated with 10 \u03bcM rupintrivir (Fig. 1B). In addition, the levels of replicon from cells treated with either 5 or 10 \u03bcM rupintrivir were decreased to below the limit of quantification by 12 days posttreatment. To further characterize the inhibitory effects of rupintrivir, we performed a colony formation assay with replicon cells treated with rupintrivir for 12 days. After 1 week of culture without rupintrivir but with G418 (1.5 mg/ml), the colonies were stained (Fig. 1C). Rupintrivir treatment reduced the number of colonies in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment with 10 \u03bcM rupintrivir was sufficient to completely prevent colony formation, while some colonies remained when cells were treated with 2.5 or 5 \u03bcM rupintrivir.",

To this end, HGT-NV cells were treated with 5 \u03bcM rupintrivir for 12 days in the absence of G418 selection, followed by subsequent passages in the presence of G418 with increasing concentrations of rupintrivir for up to 45 days (Fig. 1D). This approach yielded three lineages of replicon cells which were resistant to 10, 15, and 20 \u03bcM rupintrivir. To identify the mutations conferring the resistance to rupintrivir, we isolated cell clones by limiting dilution using replicon cells surviving after 45 days of culture and then evaluated the rupintrivir sensitivity of the replicon cells. In comparison to replicon cells that had been passaged in parallel in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) alone and that had an EC50 of 1.3 \u00b1 0.2 \u03bcM, rupintrivir-resistant replicon cells showed approximately 4- to 11-fold reduced sensitivity to rupintrivir, with EC50s of 5.9 \u00b1 1.3 to 14.3 \u00b1 1.7 \u03bcM (Table 1). Replicon cells treated with 20 \u03bcM rupintrivir exhibited the highest levels of resistance compared with those treated with 10 or 15 \u03bcM rupintrivir. Sequence analyses of the NS6 protease region of the replicon from the resistant clones revealed two amino acid substitutions: alanine 105 to valine (A105V) and isoleucine 109 to valine (I109V). All clones treated with 10 \u03bcM rupintrivir had the I109V single amino acid substitution, while the A105V/I109V double amino acid substitution was observed only in clones treated with 15 and 20 \u03bcM rupintrivir. The A105V single amino acid substitution alone was not observed in any of the clones sequenced.",

To gain a better understanding of the mechanism by which these mutations might affect rupintrivir binding, we examined the published crystal structures of the GI protease in complex with a peptidyl inhibitor (PDB accession number 2IPH) as well as the GV protease (PDB accession number 4ASH) (19, 20). Analysis of the protease structure revealed that I109 is positioned near the S2 and S4 pockets of the protease (Fig. 2B), regions of the protease that are involved in hydrophobic and van der Waals interactions with the P2 and P4 residues of a substrate or inhibitor (19, 21). A previous mutagenesis study has also suggested that the mutation of I109 affects the binding of the P2 and P4 residues of the substrate (22). The mutations identified here appear to be somewhat similar to those identified in a rupintrivir-resistant poliovirus (PV) strain which had single amino acid substitution, G128Q, in a flexible loop (PDB accession number 4DCD; Fig. 2B) (23, 24) and also in a rupintrivir-resistant HRV2 strain which had the N165T substitution in the S4 pocket (PDB accession number 1CQQ; Fig. 2B) (25, 26). We therefore modeled the interaction of the GI and GV proteases with rupintrivir based on the crystal structure of the HRV2 3C protease with rupintrivir (26) (Fig. 2C). These structural alignments suggested that a change in hydrophobicity associated with the I109V mutation could, in principle, result in the reduced susceptibility of protease to rupintrivir, an effect similar to that caused by the G128Q mutation in rupintrivir-resistant PV protease (Fig. 2C). In contrast, the A105V mutation showed no obvious interactions with rupintrivir in these alignments; however, the possibility of allosteric effects could not be ruled out.",

            "text": "Our findings supported the hypothesis that the amino acid positions I109 and A105 could directly or indirectly affect the susceptibility of the viral protease to rupintrivir. To address this hypothesis, we utilized our previously described cell-based FRET assay, which enables the detection of norovirus protease activity in live cells (18). We first sought to examine the impact of the substitutions on the cleavage activity of the viral protease from each genogroup. Therefore, we constructed three mutants, the A105V, I109V, and A105V/I109V mutants, with mutations in each of the GI, GII, and GV proteases. For the FRET substrate, we chose the NS1/2-NS3 cleavage site from the homologous genogroup because our prior study demonstrated that this site was efficiently cleaved by the GI, GII, and GV proteases (18). As expected, a FRET signal was detected in HEK293T cells transfected with the FRET substrate and the empty vector (EV) or an inactive protease which had a H30A substitution in the catalytic site (Fig. 3A). Each mutant protease of all genogroups showed cleavage activity comparable to that of the wild-type (WT) protease. To examine whether the loss of the FRET signal represented cleavage of the substrate, we performed Western blotting analyses on samples transfected with the FRET substrate and protease. Similar cleavage products corresponding to cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) were observed in all genogroups (Fig. 3B), confirming that the mutations did not have any overt impact on overall protease activity per se. Next, we evaluated the inhibitory effects of rupintrivir on WT and mutant proteases in the FRET assay. The GI WT protease was inhibited by rupintrivir in a dose-dependent manner with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of 1.3 \u00b1 0.4 \u03bcM, similar to that seen in the replicon cells (Fig. 3C). In comparison to GI WT protease, a significant reduction in susceptibility to rupintrivir was observed in the GI A105V, I109V, and the A105V/I109V mutant proteases, with IC50s of 4.2 \u00b1 1.1 (3.2-fold increase), 4.0 \u00b1 0.4 (3.1-fold increase), and 6.6 \u00b1 1.2 \u03bcM (5.1-fold increase), respectively (Fig. 3D). In addition, significant differences were observed when the GI A105V and I109V single mutants were compared with the A105V/I109V double mutant, suggesting that, at least in the context of the GI protease, these substitutions have an additive effect on susceptibility to rupintrivir. In contrast, when the substitutions were introduced into the GII protease, they had no measurable effect on the IC50 and only a small, but significant, effect on the GV protease. The GV WT protease showed an IC50 of 1.0 \u00b1 0.1 \u03bcM, whereas only the mutant proteases with the I109V single substitution and the A105V/I109V double substitution had reduced susceptibility to rupintrivir, with IC50s of 2.7 \u00b1 0.6 (2.7-fold increase) and 2.3 \u00b1 0.3 \u03bcM (2.3-fold increase), respectively.",

To confirm that the introduced mutations had no overt impact on protease activity when expressed in the context of the viral polyprotein, we examined the impact of the mutations on viral polyprotein processing in vitro. To this end, we generated in vitro-transcribed, capped RNA transcripts from the WT MNV-1 cDNA clone or clones carrying the rupintrivir resistance mutations and examined their translation profiles in rabbit reticulocyte lysates. We found that the processing of the mutants was largely indistinguishable from that of the WT virus (Fig. 4). Furthermore, we demonstrated that the resistance to rupintrivir was maintained when the protease was expressed from the polyprotein as the I109V single mutant, and the A105V/I109V double mutant was still able to produce mature NS3 at a concentration that prevented the cleavage of the polyprotein by the WT protease (Fig. 4).",

The WT and I109V recombinant viruses were successfully recovered in BSR-T7 cells, while the A105V and A105V/I109V recombinant viruses were nonviable (Fig. 5A). As we have previously demonstrated that RNA-mediated reverse genetics can improve the yield of recovered viruses, particularly those with reduced fitness (28), we also examined the ability of in vitro-transcribed and capped RNA to generate recombinant virus. As expected, the virus yield observed for the WT and I109V recombinant viruses was significantly higher than that obtained using a DNA-based reverse genetics system, while the A105V and A105V/I109V viruses remained nonviable (Fig. 5B). Since there is a possibility that the recombinant viruses with A105V replicate without inducing a cytopathic effect, which is used as the basis of the infectivity titration assay, we measured the levels of viral RNA in samples by qRT-PCR after three passages in culture. Despite repeated passage, we found no signs of viral RNA replication from the A105V and A105V/I109V recombinant viruses (Fig. 5C). These results suggest that amino acid residue A105 plays a critical role in virus replication in the MNV strain used in this study.",

The replication of the I109V recombinant virus was indistinguishable from that of the WT virus at all the MOIs studied. Furthermore, sequence analysis indicated that the I109V recombinant virus was genetically stable, even after multiple passages in cell culture. We then evaluated the inhibitory effects of rupintrivir and, as a control, the nucleoside viral polymerase inhibitor 2-C-methylcytidine (2CMC), against the WT and I109V recombinant viruses. Significant differences in viral titers following treatment with 10 and 20 \u03bcM rupintrivir were observed between the WT and I109V recombinant viruses at two MOIs (Fig. 6B). In addition, a small, but significant, reduction in the susceptibility of the I109V virus to rupintrivir was shown at MOIs of 0.1 and 1 TCID50/cell, with the EC90s increasing from 9.1 to 18.1 \u03bcM (2.0-fold increase; P < 0.001) and 8.9 to 17.0 \u03bcM (1.9-fold increase; P < 0.001), respectively. There was no significant difference in the EC90 values for 2CMC between the I109V and WT viruses. These results demonstrate that the I109V substitution alone is sufficient to impact susceptibility to rupintrivir in the context of the MNV protease.",

            "text": "Currently, there are no antiviral drugs for HuNoV, and as such, antiviral-resistant mutants of HuNoV have yet to pose a major clinical problem. However, a better understanding of the mechanisms of resistance to various classes of antiviral drugs is critical for developing ways of minimizing the appearance of resistance. The lack of a robust culture system for HuNoV has severely limited the development of therapeutic approaches, but with the recent discovery of the B cell and enteroid culture systems, this bottleneck now appears to have been overcome. Despite this, to date, most studies have relied on the use of a replicon-based approach due to the scalability and the robust nature of the assay. However, the mechanism by which drug resistance may occur in HuNoV has yet to be described. In the present study, we successfully generated a replicon system in a physiologically relevant cell line, namely, human gastric tumor cells (29). This was then used to isolate replicon cells with reduced susceptibility to rupintrivir. The EC50 and CC50 values of rupintrivir in the HGT-NV replicon system were 1.3 \u00b1 0.1 \u03bcM and >100 \u03bcM, respectively, which were comparable to those presented in a previous report describing a study with an HG23 cell system based on the same replicon in the Huh-7 hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (24). The inhibitory effects and the high selectivity index (CC50/EC50) of >77 were considered sufficient to perform the resistance study. Repeated cultivation of the replicon cells for 45 days in the presence of rupintrivir resulted in the selection of two amino acid substitutions, I109V and A105V/I109V, in GI protease. The precise time during the culture period when a mutation first arose was not identified in this study, as the goal was to simply identify mutations that conferred high levels of resistance to rupintrivir. The mutant with the double amino acid A105V/I109V substitution showed a tendency to be less susceptible to rupintrivir than the mutant with the I109V single amino acid substitution (Table 1). Similar features of resistance have been reported in an in vitro study with rupintrivir-resistant HRV2 (25). Serial passage of HRV2 for 62 days resulted in the single amino acid substitution N165T and double amino acid substitutions (N165T/E3G or N165T/A103V), and the mutants with these substitutions showed 2- and 5-fold reduced susceptibility to rupintrivir, respectively. In general, the resistance to protease inhibitors typically involves the accumulation of primary and secondary mutations that are located within and outside the active site of protease (30, 31). Although the process of accumulation of mutations was not clarified in this study, on the basis of the observation that the A105V substitution was not identified in isolation, it is presumed that it arose as a secondary mutation that can cause increased levels of resistance and/or compensate for some reduced functionality of the protease.",

            "text": "Amino acid sequence alignment revealed that A105 and I109 are absolutely conserved in the GI, GII, and GV genogroups (Fig. 2A). These amino acid positions were also conserved in the HuNoV GIV genogroup, which is rarely detected, whereas the bovine norovirus GIII and canine norovirus GVI genogroups had T105 and V109 in the viral protease and A105 and V109 in the viral protease, respectively (data not shown). Using a cell-based FRET assay with mutant proteases from the GI, GII, or GV genogroup, we demonstrated that the mutant proteases had proteolytic activity on an NS1/2-3 cleavage site-based substrate equivalent to that of the WT protease (Fig. 3A and B). We elucidated that the GI I109V and A105V/I109V substitutions found in replicon cells contributed directly to the reduced susceptibility to rupintrivir in the FRET assay (Fig. 3C and D). Notably, we found that the GI A105V mutant protease also showed reduced susceptibility to rupintrivir, suggesting that, at least in the context of the GI protease, the A105V substitution may affect the interaction with rupintrivir. In contrast, the A105V substitution in the GV protease had no appreciable impact on susceptibility to rupintrivir, which was consistent with results obtained using in vitro translation (Fig. 3D and 4). These results indicate that the A105 residue in GV protease is unlikely to be involved in the interaction with rupintrivir. This hypothesis was supported by the IC50s of the GV A105V/I109V double mutant, which were comparable to those of the GV I109V single mutant (Fig. 3D). Surprisingly, no significant differences in the inhibitory effects of rupintrivir were observed between the WT GII protease and proteases carrying any of the mutations. In addition, the susceptibility of the GII protease to rupintrivir was substantially lower than that of the GI and GV WT proteases. These findings suggest that the GII protease has a weaker affinity for rupintrivir than the GI and GV proteases, probably because the binding site is less conserved and the effects of susceptibility to rupintrivir by amino acid substitution are different among the different genotypes.",

Surprisingly, while the I109V mutant was readily recovered using two different reverse genetics approaches, mutants with the A105V and A105V/I109V substitutions were not viable (Fig. 6). Our FRET assays and in vitro translations assays confirmed that the mutants with the single substitution A105V and the double substitution A105V/I109V had no defect in protease activity per se (Fig. 3A and 4), suggesting that the inability to recover viable virus may be related to some other function of the protease. While the other functions that the HuNoV protease plays in the viral life cycle have yet to be fully elucidated, previous work has demonstrated that the HuNoV protease has RNA binding activity (32), as well as the ability to cleave cellular protease substrates (33). Work on the closely related poliovirus protease has also identified a phosphoinositide binding domain (34), but it remains to be determined whether the A105V mutation affects either of these or other as yet to be identified functions. It is noteworthy that the A105V mutation was not detected in isolation and was found only in combination with I109V. While it was outside the scope of the current study, it may be possible to use the MNV infectious culture system to generate secondary mutations in other NS proteins that could compensate for the A105V change introduced in the protease.",

            "text": "Although the crystal structures of proteases from different strains of norovirus are available (19, 21, 35, 36), in the absence of any crystal structure of a norovirus protease in complex with rupintrivir, the impact of these amino acid substitutions remains unclear. The crystal structure of the Norwalk virus protease revealed that the I109 residue is positioned in the S2 pocket, which is formed by residues I109, Q110, R112, and V114, and also the S4 pocket, which is formed by residues M107, I109, T161, T166, and V168 and which is considered to be involved in hydrophobic interactions with a substrate or rupintrivir (21, 36). In addition, the essential role of I109 of the S2 pocket in the binding of both P2 and P4 residues has previously been reported (22). The S2 pocket of the protease is also known to undergo conformational changes in response to the binding substrates (21). We therefore modeled the complex of the GI protease with rupintrivir based on the crystal structure of the HRV2 proteases (Fig. 2C) (10, 21). The structural alignments suggest that the GI and GII I109V substitution may affect the hydrophobic interactions of protease with rupintrivir. The mechanism of rupintrivir resistance generated in poliovirus appears to be somewhat similar, as the G128Q substitution in a flexible loop of the poliovirus 3C protease has a similar impact on susceptibility to rupintrivir (Fig. 2B) (23). Like the E3G and A103V substitutions in the 3C protease of rupintrivir-resistant HRV2, the A105V substitution was not located close to a location of the interaction of protease with rupintrivir (Fig. 2B) (25). These results may imply that these substitutions are not the primary mutations conferring resistance but are in fact secondary mutations. Moreover, despite the accumulation of multiple amino acid substitutions, high-level resistance to rupintrivir did not occur. This highlights the suggestion that there is a significant barrier to rupintrivir resistance, further supporting the possibility that viral protease is a potential therapeutic antiviral target for noroviruses.",

Briefly, BSR-T7 cells were infected with recombinant fowlpox virus expressing T7 polymerase. At 3 h postinfection, the cells were transfected with plasmids containing the MNV genome, either the WT MNV genome or the genomes of the various mutant MNV constructs, under the control of a T7 promoter. In the case of the RNA-based MNV reverse genetics system, BSR-T7 cells seeded 24 h prior to transfection were typically transfected with capped in vitro-synthesized MNV RNA. At 24 h posttransfection, the cells were frozen at \u221280\u00b0C for viral titer determination or processed for repetitive passages. The viral titer was determined from the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) in BV-2 cells. Repetitive passage was also performed with the supernatant of BSR-T7 cells transfected with the MNV plasmid in BV-2 cells. At 48 h postinoculation, the supernatant of BV-2 cells was inoculated onto BV-2 cells. Virus was passaged in BV-2 cells a further two times.
