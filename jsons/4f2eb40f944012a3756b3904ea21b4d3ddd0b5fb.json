Rather, the existing frameworks take a one-dimensional perspective. Therefore, causal networks were recommended, describing how individual indicators are interrelated, thus providing a more complete, holistic picture of what is happening in the environment. In short, process knowledge provides insight into cause-andeffect networks and is put forward to guide the selection of appropriate indicator sets.",

As we shall see in greater detail later, policymakers should try to avoid suboptimal solutions and that makes it important for them to start with a comparative analysis of a large number of options. Presently, the environmental assessment tool is limited to the agricultural production phase. After extension to the rest of the production and consumption chain the method should be generalised beyond comparing just protein food options. In view of the increasing relevance of linkages between transitions, it should be extended sufficiently to become a tool to assess the environmental sustainability of transitions in general.",

The model can be used to optimise production (e.g. with respect to resource use efficiency such as water) or to define the characteristics a variety should have for a given environment. An important insight resulting from this project is that using varieties with a high protein content cannot increase the protein yield per hectare. To achieve the latter, other traits (e.g. plant architecture to sustain leaf area duration during the grain filling period) should also be changed. Furthermore, attention was drawn to agronomic aspects, such as resistance to lodging and soil-borne diseases, which indicate that peas may not be the best choice to function as starting material for NPF production.",

Comparative studies using soy and pea proteins led to the insight that despite similarities between proteins on the molecular level, their gelling behaviour may be different.

The conclusion was drawn that -at present -oil crops may be at an advantage, because the oil fractions have better application perspectives than other non-protein fractions. Interestingly, a transition from intensive meat production to NPF production from any crop would lead to a shortage of soy oil for food applications, rather than to a surplus of this non-protein fraction. If it is assumed that all intensive livestock farming disappears and only grass-fed and other extensive meat production would remain, then this shift -irrespective of the crop (pea or soy) -would release an enormous area (over 300 million ha) of highly productive land for other uses. For example, if used to grow biomass, this would be sufficient to cover approximately 25% of the current world energy demand.",

Such research is indispensable to allow a consumer-oriented development of NPFs.

It may well be that novel techniques have to be deployed and further developed, such as techniques based on phase separation. Furthermore, in actual NPFs other components (e.g. hydrocolloids, fats) will be present. No information is available about the effects of such components on the texture and flavour of the NPFs. With respect to flavour, stakeholders from industry have indicated that starting materials for NPF production should preferably be free from \"off-flavours\".

One of the most salient results of this work, however, is the contrast between, on the one hand, a series of impressive changes in dietary choices over the last few centuries and particularly over the last few decades and, on the other hand, the observation that an individual will not easily change his or her food preferences from one day to the next.

Another example is the implicit assumption mentioned above that meat prices will continue to decrease in the future, in consequence of continuing agricultural efficiency. Probably, policymakers may show wisdom by expecting that the meat prices will not decrease but increase as a result of changes in the world market and agroecological constraints on production.

NPFs may not only exert a beneficial effect on health indirectly, via these relationships, but maybe also directly.

In addition, it produces a lot more pollution by pesticides, heavy metals and antibiotics. As an entirely novel finding, PROFETAS has clearly demonstrated that the protein transition is coupled inseparably to two other societal transitions, namely those towards sustainable energy production and towards sustainable water use (Section 6.3). The freshwater link is evident from the resource difference indicated above. The energy production link primarily regards the release of agricultural area, which is freed for biomass production. Furthermore, the considerable proportion (60-80%) of non-protein biomass released as a byproduct during NPF production may be utilised very efficiently for energy production.

As might be expected, in addition to answers, many new questions have been raised as well (see Chapter 3). These concern, among others, the way in which process and ingredient selection may fulfil consumer wishes for NPFs within certain target groups (Sections 3.2, 3.3 and 6.4). This puts forward three major challenges: how to obtain a wide range of textures by using plant proteins, how these textures are affected by ingredients other than proteins and how to obtain the desired flavour? Next to questions regarding processing, also questions with respect to primary production remain to be answered. These questions concern among others the extent to which protein composition may be manipulated without affecting the viability of the plant in the field, and which crops are the most suitable to yield raw materials with the desired specifications (Section 6.2). Another major issue is the extent to which new 213 TRANSITION FEASIBILITY AND IMPLICATIONS FOR STAKEHOLDERS 7.9 CONCLUSIONS developments in molecular biology and breeding may affect the suitability of crops for NPF production.",

Furthermore, increased availability of plant protein based foods will undoubtedly make an important contribution to food protein security, which is presently under increasing pressure from world-wide increasing meat consumption. Doubtlessly, such a transition will have a significant impact on North-South relationships and the poverty issue in the world (Section 6.5). Concerning societal desirability it has also become apparent that different actors can hold different interests and opinions here (Section 6.4). It has been clearly established that the consumer is the player who holds the key to a short-term protein transition and that Western consumers currently rate health above sustainability. For consumer-oriented product development, much more interaction is necessary between product developers and various user groups, such as consumers leaning towards health, convenience or culinary traditions.",

            "text": "Although PROFETAS was originally designed from the Western perspective, it has become clear that in developing countries the incentives to achieve a protein transition are not just different (Section 6.6), but generally much stronger (Section 6.5). In China, for example, meat production generates pressure by its inability to meet the national demand on top of the pressure generated by severe local pollution. Crops tailored to climatic (Section 6.2) and cultural (Section 6.6) characteristics are available. It can be concluded that, although the developed countries are primarily responsible for the unbalanced meat consumption referred to earlier, it is primarily the developing countries that are confronted with the effects (see Section 2.5). The latter, therefore, may experience stronger and more direct incentives to strive for a protein transition. However, the required technological expertise may be available in developed countries mainly. At any rate, if mineral oil and meat prices continue to rise, particularly in developing countries there will be opportunities for the onset of a combined protein plus biomass transition. Since the majority of the developing countries are particularly short of freshwater resources, the additional implicit water conservation will be considered an important bonus.",

Rather, insights and tools have been developed to facilitate a potential transition from meat protein to plant-derived protein products in the near future. These have been summarised in the present chapter. For the reasons outlined above we feel that a protein transition -reducing intensive livestock farming and cultivation of feed crops -is not just beneficial to the environment, but also more sustainable, most certainly socially desirable, and in the long run inevitable. It is yet unclear whether NPFs will be able to replace meat, to what extent, on what scale internationally, and how rapidly. When the window of opportunity opens, however, it will be crucial to have the technology available for more sustainable alternatives.",

However, it is interesting to note that -while exclusively working on an approach to make protein production and consumption more sustainable -the PROFETAS research community has yielded an integrated solution for various global problems far beyond its original scope. In addition to promising much more sustainable protein production -directly contributing to biodiversity and resource conservation and probably indirectly to animal welfare and human health -PROFETAS simultaneously indicated realistic options to produce a significant amount of biomass for sustainable energy production, and to save an immense volume of freshwater. This suggests that integral thinking combined with an even further extension of the disciplines involved (including health aspects, in particular) may be a promising avenue to meet the foreseeable challenges of the next few decades.",
