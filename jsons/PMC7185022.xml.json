The He-Xiong model highlights the dynamic coordination problem between creditors whose contracts mature at different times \u2014 fear of future rollover risk could motivate each current maturing creditor to run ahead of others because a run can trigger a premature liquidation and lead to credit losses. In a closely related paper, Schroth et al. (2014) extend and apply the He-Xiong model to the ABCP market. The authors show that an endogenous \u201cdilution risk\u201d, arising from higher yields demanded by maturing creditors, increases the likelihood of runs. By contrast, in our model a run imposes an additional type of negative externalities, because an ARS run in our model may trigger uncommitted liquidity support to fail and its failure makes creditors unable to liquidate their bond holdings. This new channel explains why the ARS market that lacks liquidity backstops was more susceptible to runs than the VRDO market. In addition, our different focus on empirical identification of the value of a liquidity backstop distinguishes our paper from theirs.",

As pointed out in Goldstein (2013), it is challenging to empirically identify strategic complementarities due to interactions between fundamentals and strategic behavior. Several recent papers (e.g., Chen, Goldstein, Jiang, 2010, Hertzberg, Liberti, Paravisini, 2011, Foley-Fisher, Narajabad, Verani, 2015, Schmidt, Timmermann, Wermers, 2016) utilize different sources of variation in strategic complementaries as part of their identification strategies. Different from these papers, we exploit the ARS crisis of early 2008 as a unique natural experiment for identification and can additionally identify the value of a liquidity backstop from studying jointly ARS and VRDO markets. The run-prone behavior of ARS investors is similar to strategic complementarities in withdrawal behavior of uninsured depositors in Egan et al. (2017).",

The advantage stems from a synergy between deposit-taking and loan commitments to the extent that both types of activities require banks to hold large balances of liquid assets and are not too highly correlated.7\nHowever, as Acharya and Mora (2015) argue, the recent financial crisis suggest that both sides of a bank\u2019s balance sheet might be hit simultaneously. In this paper, we further investigate the destabilizing effects when banks as liquidity providers cut back on uncommitted lending (e.g., the wave of auction failures in the ARS market).",

In Panel A, we also plot the VRDO rollover threshold (dashed line) and the ARS rollover threshold (dash-pointed line). The latter is plotted only after November 2007 when the structural change took place. The estimation results confirm that once a positive probability of auction failures is taken into account, ARS investors face a higher threshold and are more likely to run. Moreover, in February and March 2008, it is only the higher ARS rollover threshold that is crossed, not the VRDO threshold. This is consistent with the differential crisis experiences in these markets in early 2008 when there was a run in the ARS market, but not in the VRDO market. Moreover, in late 2008 following the Lehman\u2019s bankruptcy, both rollover thresholds were crossed, indicating runs in both markets.

            "text": "Alternatively, we can interpret the above results as follows. We assume that investors believe the parameter \u03ba to have two possible values, 0 or \u03ba\u00af>0 and follows a degenerate Markov process. Conditional on the belief of \u03ba=0, the parameter \u03ba in the next period takes the value of \u03ba\u00af with probability p, or 0 with probability 1\u2212p. Similarly, once the belief \u03ba\u00af is realized, it will continue to hold with probability q, or switch to 0 with probability 1\u2212q. In the model we have essentially assumed p=0 until mid November 2007 when the belief permanently switches to \u03ba\u00af (i.e., q=1). Under this alternative interpretation, the estimated value of \u03ba in Panel B of Figure 6 can be reinterpreted as the expected value of the above belief process, which allows us to infer the potential time-varying transition probabilities p and q. Specifically, we set \u03ba\u00af=0.0045 since the parameter \u03ba takes the maximum value 0.0045 in early April 2008 (see Panel B). Our results suggest that until the end of January 2008 the probability p is believed to be relatively low, around 37%. Since then the massive auction failures during February and March resulted in a sharp increase in the probability p that reached 100% in early April 2008. Put differently, the beliefs of ARS investors dramatically changed amid auction failures. Afterwards, the belief of \u03ba\u00af continues to hold with a high probability q above 70%. With this alternative interpretation, our results provide evidence for a dramatic change in beliefs during the ARS crisis in early 2008, which is consistent with a structural break in beliefs assumed in the model.",

On the one hand, the vast majority of VRDO investors are money market funds. On the other hand, ARS are mainly held by high net worth individuals and corporations, and cannot be held by money market funds. These two different classes of investors may differ in terms of their preferences or perhaps even the level of sophistication. This may explain why VRDO rate were in general slightly higher than ARS rate prior to the crisis, with a difference of about 7.5 bps in our data. If we adjust for this difference and redo the estimation, we find a slightly higher value for a liquidity backstop at around 16.7 bps per annum. So taking into account the difference in investor base attaches a slightly higher value to a liquidity backstop.",

We focus on the municipal bond markets for ARS and VRDOs, which provide an idea laboratory to identify the value of a liquidity backstop in terms of its run-mitigating role. As discussed in the paper, ARS were considered almost identical to VRDOs prior to the financial crisis, however, investors started to recognize the lack of a liquidity backstop in the ARS market at the onset of the crisis. The structural change in investors\u2019 beliefs drove a wedge in the experiences of these two markets during the crisis: the liquidity-backstop-lacking ARS market was more susceptible to runs and collapsed, while the liquidity-backstop-possessing VRDO market survived. Such structural change is also the key in identifying the value of a liquidity backstop. Based on the calibrated model, we find that a liquidity backstop is valued at about 14.5 bps per annum.",

Consistent with the literature on the \u201cneglected risk\u201d view of shadow banking, \u201cshadow money\u201d can stop being liquid or safe once investors take account of tail risks that are previously neglected (see Gennaioli et al., 2013). The key model implication in this paper is general and can be applied to shadow banking in the sense that the possibility of shadow money becoming illiquid in the future prompts investors to run more often, ex ante. Having a public liquidity backstop (e.g., deposit insurance) effectively mitigates (or even eliminates) runs induced by such liquidity risk. We leave this interesting application to future research.",
