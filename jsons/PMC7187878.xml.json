SARS-CoV-2 may infect circulating immune cells and cause increased cell death of these more helpful immune cells, leading to lymphocytopenia, which is associated with worse severity of COVID-19 [4]. The death of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells relieves inhibition and effective modulation of the innate immune system, causing an exaggerated deluge of inflammatory cytokines, resulting in a cytokine storm. Specifically, recent reports have shown that there are reduced numbers of memory T lymphocytes, Treg subtypes, and helper T cells in patients with severe COVID-19 [15]. In short COVID-19 generates an uncoordinated and aggressive immune response, specifically in those with diabetes, and this immune response causes intense damage to organs. The baseline proinflammatory state found in diabetes and obesity may serve to exacerbate this.",

Because of higher circulating glucose levels, patients with diabetes will have a higher percentage of glycated hemoglobin. SARS-CoV-2 surface proteins seem to bind to and potentially impair the heme molecule within red blood cells, causing separation of iron from the molecule to form a porphyrin [16]. This results in red blood cells carrying less oxygen and carbon dioxide, and thereby can generate cell death and intense inflammation in the lungs. Because patients with diabetes and older people have more glycated hemoglobin, they may be preferentially affected by SARS-CoV-2 binding and dissociation of iron from heme to form porphyrins [16].",

According to a paper published recently in Physiologic Reviews, \u201cthe cleavage of the new furin sites in the S protein of the [COVID-19] virus by plasmin\u2026may enhance its infectivity by expediting entry, fusion, duplication, and release in respiratory cells. Elevated plasmin(ogen) and furin levels are a common feature in COVID-19 patients with underlying medical conditions, and could be an independent factor for risk stratification of patients with COVID-19 [4,18].\u201d For the virus to infect, the S1 region of its spike fusion protein is cut and released by proteases, allowing the virus to be absorbed into the cell.

It is known that COVID-19 virus can infect endocrine pancreas cells via their expression of ACE2 receptors. As such, it's possible that pancreatic damage from the virus and resultant impairment in beta-cell insulin secretion could worsen preexisting diabetes or even predispose to new cases of diabetes in non-diabetic subjects. This could make hyperglycemia worse in the short term (and thus lead to a more severe COVID-19 disease course), and also trigger the emergence of increased rates of autoimmune diabetes, whereby the body coordinates an immune response to the damaged pancreas, with physiology akin to type 1 diabetes.",

It is important to remember that influenza and other bacterial and viral illnesses also discriminate against people with diabetes, with these individuals being six times more likely to need hospitalization during influenza epidemics than people without diabetes [22]. We must commit to evidence based dietary and lifestyle strategies that prevent and reverse disease, which have been shown to be highly effective (some studies showing reversal of diabetes in as little as 10 weeks of coaching and nutritional interventions) [23]. Strategies that involve optimization of nutrition, exercise [24], sleep hygiene [25], stress management [26], and toxin exposure [27] all play a role in management of metabolic disease, and yet have been largely missing from existing literature on management of diabetes in the setting of COVID-19.",

Wang, et al. recently put forth \u201cFive No\u201d rules for diabetes management during COVID-19 which included \u201cno going out, no gatherings, no sedentariness, no stop on medications, no anxiety [29].\u201d What is starkly missing is the clear, simple, and strong recommendation for no added sugar or ultrarefined carbohydrates, both of which are known drivers of postprandial hyperglycemia and inflammation.
