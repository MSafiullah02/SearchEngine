            "text": "After the outbreak of COVID-19, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was promptly been identified as the functional receptor of SARS-CoV-2 [2]. ACE2 is mainly distributed on the surface of well-differentiated airway epithelial cells (especially ciliated cells), and the respiratory tract has shown to be a predominant channel for HCoV to invade the human body [6]. SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe lower respiratory tract infection, resulting in acute lung injury (ALI), acute respiratory distressed syndrome (ARDS), and potentially death [7]. A retrospective study of 1099 COVID-19 patients from Zhong Nanshan's group showed, 91.1 % of the patients developed pneumonia and 3.4 % of the patients developed ARDS [8]. While Chen and colleagues reported that over 17 % of the patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan developed ARDS [9]. The fatality rate worldwide has currently reached 7.0 % [3], and respiratory failure has been considered to be the leading cause (69.5 %) of SARS-CoV-2 related death [10]. To provide some implications for clinical therapy and drug exploration, we reviewed COVID-19 related clinical studies by searching the keywords \"SARS-CoV-2\", \"COVID-19\" and \"2019-nCoV\" on Sinomed, Pubmed, Embase, WHO, and medRxiv, to explore the possible influencing factors behind COVID-19 exacerbation and related biochemical indicators.",

Compared with patients with mild symptoms, a higher proportion of severe or deceased patients had lymphopenia [[10], [11], [12], [13], [14]], which is similar to the observation during SARS-CoV infection [15]. According to the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (Trial Version 7) published by National Health Commission of China [16], an autopsy report of a patient who died from COVID-19 indicated (1) the spleen atrophied significantly, with apparent focal hemorrhage and necrosis; (2) lymphocytes in the lymph nodes were depleted and necrotized; and (3) the number of CD4+T and CD8+T cells in spleen and lymph nodes decreased significantly. These pathological characteristics coincide with that of patients who died of SARS-CoV infection [17]. Furthermore, compared with SARS in 2003, severe COVID-19 tends to have a higher viral load and a longer virus-shedding period [18,19]. Since the RNA sequence of SARS-CoV was found in the macrophages and aggregated T cells of lymph nodes [20], the direct impairment from SARS-CoV-2 may be an important cause of lymphopenia in patients with COVID-19.",

Type \u2160 interferon (IFN), including IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2, plays a critical role in prohibiting viral infections and initiating adaptive immune responses; including in SARS-CoV infection [21,22]. Type \u2160 IFN can inhibit virus replication in vitro as well as in macaques and mice [[23], [24], [25], [26]]. However, SARS-CoV may delay or evade innate immune response through early antagonism on IFN response, in which IFN can only be detected after SARS-CoV reached a high titer [7,27,28] Present evidence implied that the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 peaks at the time of presentation, even earlier than the time to peak of SARS-CoV [29]. We suspected that similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 may escape from the immune response through the \u201cphysical\u201d cover of double-membrane vesicles (DMV) and the \u201cchemical\u201d interference of the proteins encoded by itself [30,31],",

            "text": "The clearance of the virus mainly depends on cellular immunity [32]. Innate antiviral signaling is initiated upon the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by specific pattern recognition receptor (PRR) molecules expressed on host cells [33,34]. This ultimately leads to the activation of transcriptional factors, primarily interferon regulatory factor (IRF) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-\u03baB), for the induction of type \u2160 IFN and other proinflammatory mediators [33,34]. RIG-\u2160 like receptors (RLR) and Toll-like receptors (TLR) are two types of PRR that can recognize viral PAMP [34]. SARS-CoV encoded structural proteins (such as N protein and M protein), nonstructural proteins (nsp), and accessory proteins (like ORF3b and ORF6) to antagonize the recognition and signal transduction [31]. N protein inhibits INF-\u03b2 synthesis by inhibiting the activation of IRF-3 and NF-kB [35]; M protein prevents gene transcription of INF-\u03b2 by inhibiting the activation of IRF-3/IRF-7 transcription factors [36]; other proteins such as nsp1, nsp3, ORF3b and ORF6 et al. can also antagonize IFN responses [[37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43]]. Recently, a team from the University of Chicago identified that the protein nsp15 from SARS-CoV-2 is 89 % identical to the nsp15 found in SARS-CoV [44]. Since nsp15 acts as an endoribonuclease for the virus\u2019s double-stranded RNA, inhibition of nsp15 could slow viral replication [45]. Most recently, Kim et al. reported SARS-CoV-2 can also express ORF7a, 3a, 8, 6, and 7b [46], indicating that targeting these proteins may help to recover the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection at an early stage.",

Expression of immune-checkpoint molecules such as programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-3 (TIM-3), accompanied by the elevation of anti-inflammatory cytokines, is known to be the common indicators of T cell depletion [48]. Wang\u2019s team has observed that up-regulated PD-1 and TIM-3 between COVID-19 patients and healthy individuals, and between prodromal stages and overtly symptomatic stages among COVID-19 patients; which was also associated with the increased levels of anti-inflammatory IL-10 [47]. The expression of inhibitory immune receptors T-cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain (TIGIT) and the CD94/NK group 2 member A (NKG2A) on CD8 + T cells were increased significantly in COVID-19 patients [49,50]. However, our current knowledge about T cell (mainly CD8 + T cell) depletion gained from the research of tumors and chronic viral infection, such as HIV and HBV. It is generally believed that this phenomenon occurs when the body has been stimulated by antigens for a \u201clong\u201d period of time, which is not in line with acute viral infection [48,51]. Therefore, it is not clear that T cell exhaustion is actually accruing in SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

            "text": "Although the direct damage from the viruses contributes to the initiation of the disease, the cytokine storm caused by HCoV plays a vital role in the development of ALI and ARD [7]. Cytokines are a group of small molecular proteins secreted by immune and tissue cells that includes interleukin (IL), colony-stimulating factor (GSF), IFN, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), growth factor (GF) and chemokines. Cytokines participate in immune responses through the activation of multiple signaling pathways, such as JAK-STAT, TRAF-NF-\u03baB, TRAF-AP-1, and IRAK-NF-\u03baB [32]. The term \u201ccytokine storm\u201d appeared for the first time in an article relating to graft-versus-host disease in 1993 [52] as an interpretation for mechanisms of immune diseases or chronic inflammation. Gradually, scientists found that viruses, including cytomegalovirus, streptococci, influenza virus, and SARS-CoV, can also evoke cytokine storms [[53], [54], [55], [56]]. During viral infection, PRRs activate IRF and NF-\u03baB pathways by recognizing PAMP, then promote the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines from infected local epithelial cells or macrophages. These cytokine-activated macrophages and virus-infected dendritic cells (DC) lead to a broader immune response, attracting more inflammatory cells to inflammatory sites, releasing a large number of cytokines, which eventually, results in a cytokine storm. Excessive cytokines may spill into the circulatory system and cause systemic cytokine storms, resulting in multiple organ dysfunction [7,57].",

While the level of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in severe patients was significantly lower than that in healthy controls [[58], [59], [60]]. At the beginning of the epidemic, Huang et al. reported that the plasma levels of IL2, IL7, GSCF, CXCL10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF-\u03b1 were higher in COVID-19 patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) than those of COVID-19 patients outside the ICU [61]. Furthermore, the relatively higher level of serum ferritin was also seen in deceased patients comparing with discharged patients, and in severe patients comparing with mild patients [62,63]. Thus, the pattern of cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients was thought to be similar to secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH) [[64], [65], [66]]. Unlike the cytokines profile of SARS patients, COVID-19 patients have a remarkable increase of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 (Table 1\n), which has been often seen in HLH patients in previous studies [61,67,68]. Compared with other increased cytokines, increased IL-10 was frequently associated with IL-6 in patients with severe disease(Table 1) [13,69,47,61], suggesting both IL-10 and IL-6 are the indicators of COVID-19 exacerbation.",

Although IL-6 has been proposed to be involved in the repair of lung injury in the mouse model of influenza A H1N1 virus [83], it contributes to the pathogenesis of inflammatory or autoimmunity diseases [84,85], and excessive production of IL-6 leads to serious disease progression in viral infection [86,87].",

(Fig. 1\n). The similarity in the signaling network between IL-10 receptors and IL-6R suggests the common biological process among IL-10 and IL-6 [99]. It has been reported that IL-6 cooperated with IL-10 to eliminate pathogens and modulate the cellular immune response in the patient infected with the H1N1 influenza virus, but the produced immunosuppressive environment delayed virus clearance or increase secondary infection [86,100]. Pathological findings of a deceased COVID-19 patient showed elevated IL-6 and IL-10 with increased highly proinflammatory CCR4+CCR6+Th17 in peripheral CD4+T cells [101]. Rapid accumulation of proinflammatory cytokines stimulates the over-reaction of anti-inflammatory response, resulting in severe immune injury in patients. Chinese Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (Trial Version 7) suggests the increase of IL-6 as an indicator for critical patients [16]. We recommend measuring both IL-10 and IL-6 as the signs of the cytokine storm intensification in COVID-19 patients.",

A retrospective study of continuous intravenous infusion of anakinra in five patients established a rapid serologic and subsequent clinical improvement in adult patients with sHLH [104] and a randomized, placebo-controlled phase III trial indicated that anakinra reduced mortality in sepsis patients with features of sHLH [105]. Tocilizumab, which attracts more attention compared with anakinra, was found to improve fever, hypoxemia, lung lesions, and CRP levels in most of the severe COVID-19 patients with no obvious adverse reactions in retrospective studies, but several patients still aggravated [106,107]. Serum level of IL-6 after tocilizumab therapy tended to further spike initially, and then decrease, while the patients who failed treatment exhibited a persistent and dramatic increase of IL-6 [107,108]. Nevertheless, we cannot draw any firm conclusions on the efficacy and safety of anakinra or tocilizumab due to the limited sample size and retrospective method of the present evidence. Further studies are required to determine the probability of potential secondary infection, and to find an appropriate biochemical indicator for monitoring the therapeutic effect. Clinical trials evaluating anakinra (NCT04341584, NCT04324021, NCT04339712, and NCT04330638) and tocilizumab (ChiCTR2000029765, ChiCTR2000030796, ChiCTR2000030894, NCT04317092, NCT04335071, and NCT04320615 et al) in the treatment of COVID-19 are ongoing across the world.",

[115] reported that 90.5 % of deceased patients had elevated PCT levels (0.11\u221275 ng/mL), including PCT > 0.25 ng/mL in 12 patients and PCT > 0.5 ng/mL in 9 patients, and the PCT value increased from the admission to death. In another retrospective study of 1099 COVID-19 patients, higher proportions of PCT > 0.5 ng/mL were found in severe cases than mild cases (13.7 % vs 3.7 %) [8]. Patients who reached primary composite endpoint (including admission to an ICU, the use of mechanical ventilation, or death) had a higher proportion of PCT > 0.5 ng/mL than patients without end-point events (24.0 % vs 3.9 %) [8]. The correlation between increased PCT and severe COVID-19 was also observed in pediatric patients [116]. These findings, although preliminary, suggested that bacterial infection may promote the aggravation of COVID-19. Timely measuring PCT as a sign of secondary bacterial infection for the decision of antibacterial agents use is critical for COVID-19 patients. The aggravation of COVID-19 ascribed to the secondary bacterial infection and the adverse events caused by unreasonable use of antibiotics could be reduced. The most effective selection of the antibiotic agents should be based on bacterial culture. In consideration of the dysregulation of the immune system in severe COVID-19 patients, antibiotic agents with immunomodulatory effects, such as macrolides (erythromycin and clarithromycin) might be a better option. Previous studies have shown that in addition to antibacterial effects, these drugs can also alleviate inflammatory reactions by reducing the accumulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and regulating neutrophil function and apoptosis [[117], [118], [119], [120]].",

SARS-CoV-2 could cause lymphopenia and cytokine storm, together with secondary bacterial infections, adding to the deterioration of the disease in severe cases of COVID-19. Understandings of the dynamic process of SARS-CoV-2 infection would help to make an appropriate decision on treatment strategies. We recommend measuring both IL-10 and IL-6 as a sign of intensification of cytokine storm in severe COVID-19 cases, though test IL-10 is not routinely carried out in the clinic setting. We also recommend using serum PCT level to guild the initiation of antibacterial agents in patient with COVID-19. Although the selection of immunomodulators is challenging, previous retrospective studies have revealed distinct immune regulators between the early and late stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection. For instance, supplementation of type \u2160 IFN, instead of GCs, at the early stage of infection may help to control the virus and relieve injury. IL-1R and IL-6R antagonists could potentially be the effective choices for managing cytokine storm. However, these preliminary results would need to be validated from multiple ongoing RCTs. Due to the rapid nature of COVID-19 pandemic, global collaboration in research and information sharing is ultimately needed.",

Together with TGF-\u03b2, IL-6 leads to the activation of STAT3; thus relieving the repression of ROR\u03b3t and promoting the Th17 cells transcriptional program. It has also been established that IL-17 produced by activated Th17 cells are able to trigger a positive-feedback loop of IL-6 expression through NF-\u03baB and STAT3 signaling. Additionally, IL-6 prevents T cells from differentiating into Th1 cells through the inhibition of TNF-\u03b3 signaling by the upregulation of suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS1). IL-6 can also induce the production of endogenous IL-4, consequently driving the T cells to differentiate into Th2 cells. This, in turn, inhibits the differentiation and function of Th1 cells due to the cytokines produced from Th2 cells.",
