Although it is still not fully established if RNA viruses could generate miRNAs that would target their own genes or alter the host gene expression, there are examples of miRNAs functioning as an antiviral defense mechanism. In the case of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there are several mechanisms that would make miRNAs impact the virus, like interfering with replication, translation and even modulating the host expression. In this study, we performed a machine learning based miRNA prediction analysis for the SARS-CoV-2 genome to identify miRNA-like hairpins and searched for potential miRNAbased interactions between the viral miRNAs and human genes and human miRNAs and viral genes. Our PANTHER gene function analysis results indicate that viral derived miRNA candidates could target various human genes involved in crucial cellular processes including transcription. For instance, a transcriptional regulator, STAT1 and transcription machinery might be targeted by virus-derived miRNAs. In addition, many known human miRNAs appear to be able to target viral genes. Considering the fact that miRNA-based therapies have been successful before, comprehending mode of actions of miRNAs and their possible roles during SARS-CoV-2 infections could create new opportunities for the development and improvement of new therapeutics.",

The coronavirus subfamily is divided into four genera: \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, and \u03b4 based on serotype and genome features 3. The genome of a typical CoV codes for at least 6 different open reading frames (ORFs), which has variations based on the CoV type 4. Some ORFs encode non-structural proteins while others code for structural proteins required for viral replication and pathogenesis. Structural proteins include spike (S) glycoprotein, matrix (M) protein, small envelope (E) protein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein with various roles for virus enterance and spread. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to \u03b2 CoV with 45-90% genetic similarity to SARS-CoV based on sequence analysis and might share similar viral genomic and transcriptomic complexity 3,5. Currently, it has been also revealed that SARS-COV-2 has a very high homology with bat CoVs, which indicated how it is transmitted to human without knowing intermediate carriers 6. S protein of SARS-CoV-2 has a strong interaction with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expressed on alveolar epithelial cells which shows the way of virus infection in human 7. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding RNAs that play role in regulation of the gene expression in various organisms ranging from viruses to higher eukaryotes. It has been estimated that miRNAs might influence around 60% of mammalian genes and their main effect is on regulatory pathways including cancer, apoptosis, metabolism and development 8. Although the current release of miRNAs, the standard miRNA depository, lists miRNAs of 271 organisms, only 34 of them are viruses 9. While, the first virus-encoded miRNAs was discovered for the human Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) 10, more than 320 viral miRNA precursors were reported so far. Although it has been shown that various DNA viruses express miRNAs, it is still debatable if RNA viruses could also encode. The major concerns regarding miRNAs of RNA viruses are based on 11: -the fact that RNA viruses that replicate in cytoplasm, do not have access to nuclear miRNA machinery -since RNA is the genetic material, miRNA production would interfere with viral replication On the other hand, many features of miRNA -based gene regulation seems to be especially beneficial for viruses. For instance, through targeting specific human genes by viral miRNAs, it is possible to form an environment suitable for survival and replication of the virus. Furthermore, for viral miRNAs it is likely to escape host defense system since host itself generates miRNAs in the same manner.",

Among those, minimum free energy (mfe) values required for the folding of secondary structures of hairpin sequences and hairpin sequence lengths of known human miRNAs from miRBase and predicted hairpins of SARS-CoV-2 were compared ( Figure 1 ). Based on the box-plots shown in Figure 1 , most of the extracted viral hairpins seem to be smaller than human miRNA precursors. Since viruses would need to use at least some members of host miRNA biogenesis pathway elements, viral miRNAs should be similar to host miRNAs to a certain degree. Therefore, a classification scheme trained with known human miRNAs was applied on SARS-CoV-2 hairpins. Only 29 hairpins out of 950 passed the 0.900 prediction score threshold and used for further analysis. From these hairpins, 30 mature miRNA candidates were extracted and their possible targets for human and SARS-CoV-2 genes were investigated. SARS-CoV-2 miRNA candidates were further analyzed to test if they were similar to any of the known mature miRNAs from 271 organism listed in miRBase. To achieve this, a basic similarity search was performed based on the Levenshtein distance calculations in KNIME. However, there was no significant similarity between hairpin or mature sequences.",

In addition, viruses might use host cellular miRNAs for their own advantage. Therefore, molecular elucidation of the roles of miRNAs in host-virus interaction might provide a deeper understanding for viral pathogenesis and the development of an effective antiviral therapy as shown in several viruses including Herpesvirus, Enterovirus and Hepatitis C 30-32. Although the detailed knowledge about viral miRNAs have been obtained from DNA viruses, it is still controversial for RNA viruses that whether they produce their own miRNAs or not 33. However, there are several reports showing the presence of non-canonical (due to the lack of classical stem-loop structure in miRNAs), small miRNA-like small RNAs produced during viral infections as shown in H5N1 Influenza 34, Ebola virus 35 and HIV-1 36. Although they play crucial roles in several viral infections, miRNAs have not been studied in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we elucidated miRNA-mediated regulation responsible for SAR-CoV-2 infection by predicting possible host genes targeted by viral miRNAs and viral genes targeted by cellular miRNAs, which might provide potential ways to understand the underlying mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We investigated possible virulent genes of SARS-CoV-2 targeted by host-cellular miRNAs as shown in",

            "text": ". Based on the panther analysis, regulators of eukaryotic transcription would be the most important targets of 18 SARS-CoV-2 derived mature miRNA like candidates out of 29 hairpins in total. These transcriptional regulators are involved in both basal transcription machinery including several components of human mediator complex (MED1, MED9, MED12L, MED19) and basal transcription factors such as TAF4, TAF5 and TAF7L. Viruses might downregulate host gene expression in order to increase their gene expression either co-transcriptionally in the nucleus or post-transcriptionally in the nucleus or cytoplasm 45. Therefore, targeting basal transcription machinery such as components (TAFs) of TFIID complex by SARS-CoV-2 could prevent RNA polymerase II to assemble on promoters of host genes at the initiation step. Viral factors have been shown to block transcription initiation by inhibiting TFIID or more specifically TAF4 in herpesvirus 46. Another interesting target gene by SARS-CoV-2 miRNA was different subunits of CCR4-NOT transcription complex including CNOT4, CNOT10 and CNOT6L, which are deadenylases involved in mRNA decay 47. Therefore, suppression of these genes by viral miRNAs could impede mRNA turnover in the host and provide opportunities for viral mRNA to escape from degradation. Additionally, site specific trans-acting factors such as MAFG, STAT1, STAT5B and SOX11 would be targeted by viral miRNAs. STAT family transcription factors are activated by cytokine-induced stimuli and generally involved in an interferon response. In Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), viral miRNAs were found to inhibit STAT3 and STAT5, resulting in deregulated interferon response and transition into lytic viral replication 48. As a conclusion, viral diseases have been paid attention as a global health problem due to the lack of proper treatment strategies and rapid evolution of viruses. In recent years, studies have focused on identifying miRNAs as targets for the treatment of viral diseases and there are promising clinical phase studies evaluating the therapeutic potential of antagomirs targeting host miRNAs such as miR-122 in hepatitis C 49.
