When we perform the local search on seq| Iw , only positions that contribute to the distance to the target, see Figure 9 , or positions adjacent to the latter, will be altered. We use the arrays U 1 , U 2 to store the unpaired and paired positions of T . In this process, we allow for mutations that increase the structure distance by five with probability 0.1.

As discussed in the introduction it has to be given an argument as to why the inverse folding of pseudoknot RNA structures works. While folding maps into RNA secondary structures are well understood, the generalization to 3-noncrossing RNA structures is nontrivial. However the combinatorics of RNA pseudoknot structures [28, 29, 40] implies the existence of large neutral networks, i.e. networks composed by sequences that all fold into a specific pseudoknot structure. Therefore, the fact that it is indeed possible to generate via Inv sequences contained in the neutral networks of targets against competing pseudoknot configurations, see Figure 23 and Figure 24 confirms the predictions of [32] .",

In this assignment the probability of a unpaired position being assigned either A or U is greater than assigning G or C. Similarly, the probability of pairs G-C and C-G base pairs is greater than that of the other base pairs. Then, RNA-SSD derives a hierarchical decomposition of the target structure. It recursively splits the structure and thereby derives a binary decomposition tree rooted in T and whose leaves correspond to T -substructures. Each nonleaf node of this tree represents a substructure obtained by merging the two substructures of its respective children. Given this tree, RNA-SSD performs a stochastic local search, starting at the leaves, subsequently working its way up to the root. INFO-RNA employs a dynamic programming method for finding a well suited initial sequence. This sequence has a lowest energy with respect to the T . Since the latter does not necessarily fold into T , (due to potentially existing competing configurations) INFO-RNA then utilizes an improved 3 stochastic local search in order to find a sequence in the neutral network of T . In contrast to RNAinverse, INFO-RNA allows for increasing the distance to the target structure.
