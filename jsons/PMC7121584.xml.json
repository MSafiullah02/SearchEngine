Even more significant are the changes that occur during pregnancy when the entire body changes to accommodate the developing fetus. Although none of these changes are directly related to the respiratory system, they do exert a significant effect in the mechanics of breathing. Thus, the physician who cares for a woman with respiratory symptoms has to consider if and to what extent they are caused, complicated, or exacerbated by an underlying gynecologic or obstetric condition. This chapter focuses on the normal alterations in pulmonary physiology during pregnancy and how it may affect the natural history of specific respiratory diseases and of course how the respiratory disease may affect the pregnancy outcome. Lung disorders related to gynecologic conditions are also described.",

The changes include increases in the transverse diameter of the thorax that results into an increase of approximately 50% in the subcostal angle. As a result, the diaphragm is elevated by 4\u20135 cm. This would significantly impair the ability of the diaphragm to move during inspiration, but it is compensated by an increase in the anteroposterior diameter as well that allows the diaphragm to maintain a fairly normal excursion. However, the overall chest wall compliance decreases. There appears to be no effect on the respiratory muscle strength although the changes in the chest wall configuration probably puts the muscle at a mechanical disadvantage, thus contributing to the increased work of breathing that pregnant women experience. Interestingly, most of the alterations in the chest wall occur primarily during the first trimester of the pregnancy when the uterus is still too small to have any substantial mechanical effect. It is believed that the chest wall configuration changes as a result of hormonal action, especially of relaxin that relaxes the ligaments of the lower rib cage, thus allowing the increase in the diameters.\n",

This is due to elevation of the diaphragm and increased pulmonary blood volume in pregnancy. The inspiratory capacity (IC) remains essentially the same or even increases, and as a result, the total lung capacity (TLC) is only marginally decreased.\n",

Some epidemiologic studies have shown an increased risk of congenital abnormalities (cleft palate with oral corticosteroids, gastroschisis with bronchodilators) in the offsprings of asthmatic women, but the evidence is far from conclusive.

It is also known as menstruation-related spontaneous pneumothorax (MSP) which was first reported in the 1950s by Maurer et al., who defined it as pneumothorax occurring within 24\u201372 h after onset of menses. In 1972, Lillington et al. introduced the term catamenial pneumothorax for spontaneous pneumothorax associated with menses. Previously considered to be rare, current knowledge suggests that CP is a more common reason for spontaneous pneumothoraces in women of reproductive age. As mentioned in the previous section, CP is frequently associated with thoracic endometriosis syndrome (TES), but there might be other etiological mechanisms. The etiology of the remainder is obscure, but a number of theories have been proposed. During menstruation, the absence of the normal cervical mucus plug provides a connection between the ambient air and the abdominal cavity through the uterus and fallopian tubes, hence allowing the air to move across the diaphragm through right-sided diaphragmatic fenestrations into the pleural space. This may account for the fact that 90\u201395% of MSPs are right-sided. A second theory is that bronchospasm with air trapping and pneumothorax may occur due to high levels of prostaglandin F2 during menstruation. The third theory is that pleural blebs or bullae are more prone to rupture during menstruation because of hormonal changes. For cases that are not clearly associated with systemic endometriosis, thoracoscopy during menstruation helps determine the etiology. Successful treatment necessitates a combined medical and surgical approach.",
