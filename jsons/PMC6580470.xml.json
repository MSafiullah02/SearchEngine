This lack of convincing data has been stressed in a recent Consensus Conference conducted with the aim of identifying research priorities and develop recommendations regarding treatments of pARDS [3]. The authors stated that little is known about this condition, although areas of agreement were found among the experts. Surfactant is probably the therapy with the highest level of expectations, but still few convincing data support its use for pARDS. The rationale is that qualitative and quantitative deficiency of surfactant has a role in the development of acute respiratory failure [4, 5] and surfactant dysfunction is correlated with major clinical endpoints such as mortality and length of PICU stay [6]. On the other hand, the lack of large, randomized controlled trial (RCT) in pARDS and surfactant use limited the evidence supporting clear benefit. Most of the studies are on small series except three RCT on the effect of calfactant [7\u20139]. The populations enrolled are poorly homogenous for surfactant dosing, age or underlying diseases. The initial evidence suggested that surfactant could be more useful in primary ARDS such as respiratory infection, aspiration, trauma and near-drowning [10\u201312]. Indeed, in these conditions surfactant deficiency might be more relevant.",

Others forms of surfactant failed to demonstrate positive effects in pARDS. In his trial Moller used bovine surfactant but no differences were shown either in terms of reduction of MV days or for PICU length of stay [18]. For the same endpoints, Thomas [19] using lucinactant did not report any difference between cases and controls. A separate mention deserves the two studies published by Willson on the use of calfactant. In his first trial published in 2005 [7], he showed a positive effect in terms of mortality and ventilator free days but not as PICU LOS. Unfortunately none of these data has been replicated in the second study in 2013 [8]. A more recent RCT published by Thomas on the use of calfactant in patients with leukemia/lymphoma or after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and pARDS reported data that did not support the use of calfactant among this high mortality cohort to increase survival [9].",

The third difference is the introduction of the recruitment manoeuvre after each administration. The importance of recruitment has been well demonstrated in adults [20, 21] while not yet proven in pediatrics [3].

The difficulty to perform a RCT in pediatrics is high and the reasons are well known [24]. Moreover, most of the centers that enrolled and treated patients are confident with surfactant use and might not accept to waive its use in moderate or severe pARDS. However, on the basis of this preliminary study, we plan to submit to the collaborative PICU network the design of a prospective randomized controlled trial in order to reach a higher level of evidence on the efficacy of surfactant in pARDS. Beside surfactant use (timing, dose, administration mode), the protocol should strictly define and describe how to manage ventilation, nutrition, fluid and transfusion management in order to reduce possible confounding behavior. The second limitation is that we did not record consistently pulmonary mechanics variables such as compliance and resistance. These measures might better define changes in treated patients and help to identify responder and non-responders. Moreover, not all the children with ARDS during the study years were enrolled in the study. Through the Italian registry of PICU admission (TIPNet) we estimated that 10\u201330% of children who developed pARDS in any form of severity did not receive surfactant. Unfortunately, we cannot stratify for severity (mild, moderate, severe) as this information is not available in the registry for all the patients. However, we asked the centers to describe the local habit and in most of them surfactant is used only for severe pARDS forms. The protocol dissemination among PICU teams and the skills needed for surfactant use contributed to loss of some cases. A high variability in practices in different PICUs, has been recently published by Newth et al. [25]. This study showed how pediatric intensivists are inconsistent in their decisions about ventilatory support in children with pARDS and how ventilator management varies substantially in these children.",

This study also supports the administration in two different doses, lavage and substitution, the use of recruitment manoeuvre after each one, as well as the early use once the ARF is requiring high pressure mechanical ventilation and elevated FiO2 or the use of nonconventional ventilation modes.",
