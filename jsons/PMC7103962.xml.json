            "text": "Bats are natural reservoir hosts for many viruses which are recognised as serious potential threats to human and/or animal health (Calisher et al., 2006). The bat-borne viruses emerging in the African, Asian and Australian continents have come to the fore more recently with regards to their threat to human health and pandemic potential. Since 2003 there have been a number of large-scale human outbreaks of bat-borne diseases e.g. Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Western Africa and Asia respectively, whilst a significant number of human cases of Nipah virus (NiV) are reported in Bangladesh every year (IEDCR, 2014). Pteropid bats are known to be the natural host of Hendra virus (HeV) (Halpin et al., 2000), a member of the same genus (Henipavirus) as Nipah virus. Since 1994 HeV has been responsible for seven human cases in Australia, four of which were fatal (Smith et al., 2016). Bats have also been linked with Marburg virus (MARV) (Towner et al., 2007), and, more tenuously, with the emerging Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (Memish et al., 2013). Within the European Union (EU), zoonotic incidents of bat-borne viruses have been restricted to European bat lyssavirus types 1 and 2 which have been responsible for less than 10 human cases since 1977 (Fooks et al., 2003). To date, there have only been a few isolated reports of introduction of bat-borne viruses (e.g. MARV, SARS, MERS-CoV) from outside the EU mainly through entry of infected humans (Puzelli et al., 2013, Desenclos et al., 2004, WHO 2008, Reuss et al., 2014). However, these incidents illustrate that introduction can occur and support the need for some level of surveillance activity to assess the probability of when and where further incursions may take place.",

            "text": "For most bat-borne zoonotic diseases, primary transmission routes for human infection include direct or indirect contact with bat bodily fluids (Leroy et al., 2009, Luby et al., 2006), or via intermediate animal hosts (Parashar et al., 2000, Hanna et al., 2006). Onward transmission of disease is then possible via human-to-human contact or contact with contaminated fomites or the environment, with nosocomial infections being particularly important in some instances (Baron et al., 1983, Chowell et al., 2014). Disease introduction into the EU could therefore potentially occur from a number of routes, including human travel, illegal and legal importation of food products and transport of live animals. These routes have previously been associated with incursion of other viruses into the EU. For example, human travel and immigration are thought to be the primary reasons why individual Member States (MSs) have a high prevalence of the same Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) subtypes as their historical African colonies (Faria et al., 2012). Classical rabies has been detected in imported domestic pets (Su\u00e1rez-Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2013, McQuiston et al., 2008) and avian influenza (H5N1 type A) has been detected in illegal imports of Crested Hawk Eagles from Thailand into Belgium (Van Borm et al., 2005). In the case of trade, illegal importation of food products has been a suggested route of origin for the foot and mouth disease epidemic in the UK in 2001 (Defra, 2001), whilst legal trade in fresh produce, such as fruit and vegetables, has been associated with norovirus (Hjertqvist et al., 2006) and hepatitis A outbreaks (Dentinger et al., 2001). Virus specific transmission characteristics may influence the relative importance of these potential routes of disease introduction.",

To address these issues, a number of relative risk ranking tools have previously been developed, such as the EU wide DISCONTOOLS (2016) and the UK specific D2R2 (Gibbens et al., 2016). However, these tools are qualitative and are generally based on chosen criteria rather than a defined quantitative assessment. There is, therefore, benefit in a quantitative model that can utilises freely available numerical data from datasets on trade and human travel such as Eurostat (2014) and FaoStat (2014).",

Using current knowledge of virus characteristics such as environmental survival and host incubation periods, the framework was parameterised for NiV, to provide an assessment of the relative risks of transmission through the known pathways of introduction into the EU. In this paper the model framework is parameterised for a number of other virus outbreak scenarios (MARV, EBOV, HeV and MERS-CoV) and the relative probabilities of introduction to EU MSs are compared and discussed. The impact of uncertainty in the parameter estimates is also investigated though scenario analyses.",

For EBOV two different outbreak scenarios were considered: 1) Disease geographically distributed in Western Africa, where the human cases are on a similar scale to that observed in the 2014 West Africa outbreak (wEBOV) (i.e. epidemic situation), 2) Disease geographically distributed in Central Africa, where human outbreaks have previously been relatively limited (cEBOV) (i.e. non-epidemic situation). It is acknowledged that the link between bats and MERS-CoV is more tenuous than initially thought when it first emerged (Memish et al., 2013), but the virus was included here to provide an example of a respiratory coronavirus circulating within the Middle East area. Recent evidence of replication and shedding of MERS-CoV in experimentally infected Jamaican fruit bats (Artibeus jamaicensis) (Munster et al., 2016) and discovery of closely related MERS-like CoV (Anthony et al., 2017) further support the hypothesis that bats are ancestral reservoirs for MERS-CoV. As neither live EBOV nor MERS-CoV virus has been isolated from bats a very low prevalence of infection in bats was assumed. Different prevalence values for all the viruses were considered in the scenario analysis.",

This value was assumed by the authors to encompass all relevant historical data. However, as human cases of MERS-CoV have been reported regularly since March 2012, nHinf(k) was calculated by dividing the number of reported cases by the number of reporting years assuming a constant rate per year. To account for differences in prevalence between passenger types e.g. business, visiting family, and tourist etc., the baseline prevalence of infection in the exporting country was weighted by the average passenger duration of stay (days) in the exporting country. The ratio of passenger types was assumed to be the same for each exporting country. The sub-clinically infected population was estimated by multiplying the prevalence of infection in passenger type i, \u03b8(i,k) by the incubation period of the virus.

It was found that while some scenarios had an impact on the absolute values of probability of introduction of NiV, the relative rankings, of both routes and MSs were more robust. However, the estimate for the prevalence of NiV in bats had considerable impact on the average number of years to an EU introduction of NiV relative to the baseline model and much lower estimates for this prevalence were the only scenarios to have an impact on the relative ranking between the routes.

For HeV and NiV, however, where the legal trade and bushmeat routes posed the highest risk in the baseline model the decrease in overall risk was substantial. Human travel replaced legal trade and bushmeat as the route with the highest associated probability for HeV, MARV and NiV introduction when the virus prevalence in bats was reduced by 99% (90% for MARV).",

Uncertainty in these virus parameters, in particular, the prevalence of infection in bats in the exporting country, and viral persistence during processing and storage may limit the application of the model by introducing considerable uncertainty. The sensitivity analysis of virus prevalence in bats demonstrated that the results for the relative importance of the routes for EBOV and MERS were quite robust with human travel remaining the route with the highest probability of introduction. With regards to HeV, NiV and MARV, however the sensitivity to the variation in prevalence indicates that further data for this particular parameter would strengthen the model results; this is particularly true of MARV where a 90% reduction in virus prevalence changed the risk ranking order of the routes of introduction. Note that this analysis is to consider the uncertainty about the true prevalence in bats, as such it has no impact on the parameterisation of the human prevalence, which is based on human outbreak data.",

We have demonstrated here that changes in the virus prevalence in bats in the exporting country can have an impact on the average number of years to EU entry for the different viruses and on the relative ranking of the individual routes of entry. We have also highlighted the differences in probabilities for two Ebola scenarios; a relatively small non-epidemic human outbreak and a large epidemic scale outbreak.

This route was considered in the model based on the knowledge that fruit bats are known to consume raw fruit in orchards (Eby and Lunney, 2002) and date palm sap is a known route of transmission for NiV (another henipavirus) (Luby et al., 2006, Khan et al., 2012, Nahar et al., 2014). Similarly, there is currently no evidence of human-to-human transmission of HeV but as this has occurred for the Bangladesh strain of NiV (Gurley et al., 2007) it is plausible that this could occur with or without mutation and adaptation of currently identified strains. Real-time application of the model would allow for removal or addition of pathways if future scientific work provides suitable input data or if trade patterns between third countries and the EU alter.

A general lack of data on virus specific parameters also contributed to this uncertainty. Thus, the main strengths of this model lie in the comparison of the relative risks between viruses and routes of entry. Whilst there have been several risk assessments carried out for the introduction of individual pathogens into the EU (Rolin et al., 2013, Durand et al., 2013, Mur et al., 2014, Snary et al., 2012) this model was able to assess a range of viruses and could be adapted for other pathogens, as it has the advantage of easy access to a number of relevant databases.
