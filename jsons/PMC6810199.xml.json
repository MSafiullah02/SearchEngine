            "text": "The Respiratory Infections in Andean Peruvian Children (RESPIRA-Peru) study is a prospective cohort study conducted in the Province of San Marcos, Department of Cajamarca, located in the northern highlands of Peru. Malaria is not endemic in this high-altitude study community (median altitude of study households 2,726 m). The population is primarily rural with low income and limited access to healthcare services, as previously described (6,7,16,23,28\u201334). Nearly all residents of San Marcos descended from the same ethnic group of Spanish people who mixed with the local Quechua population. During May 2009\u2013September 2011, enrolled children <3 years of age residing in the study area were prospectively assessed for ARI symptoms during weekly household visits. An ARI episode was defined as the presence of either cough or fever. This definition of ARI has been applied in many large surveillance studies (35,36). Although fever alone is not highly specific for the diagnosis of ARI, it is well established that fever is often the only sign of ARI, especially in young children (35). In addition to cough and fever, we collected data on other respiratory signs and symptoms, including rhinorrhea, ear pain, malaise, tachypnea, nasal flaring, stridor, wheezing, and accessory muscle retractions. We considered a child to be asymptomatic if the child had rhinorrhea alone or no ARI symptoms. ",

We also randomly selected a subset of nasopharyngeal samples collected during asymptomatic periods, >8 days apart from an ARI episode, to undergo real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) viral testing at Vanderbilt University for influenza virus (types A, B, and C), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (MPV), rhinovirus (HRV), adenovirus (AdV), and parainfluenza virus (PIV) types 1\u20133 (23,32). Because detections of respiratory viruses other than HRV and AdV were infrequent in nasopharyngeal samples collected during those asymptomatic periods (23), we classified viral detections into distinct groups: HRV only; AdV only; sole detection of other virus (influenza, RSV, MPV, or PIV); co-detection of >1 respiratory virus; and no virus detected.",

            "text": "We transformed pneumococcal density values to stabilize their variance, as previously described (6,7), by applying log10(x + 1) transformation to colonization density values, where x represents the measured density. We performed unadjusted group comparisons by using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Kruskal-Wallis test, or median test with Bonferroni adjustments, as appropriate. We used multivariable linear quantile mixed effects regression to model the median of log-transformed pneumococcal density against viral detection group, with random effects to account for correlation among multiple measurements collected from the same child. Other covariates included age at the time of sample collection, sex, recent exposure to antibiotics (i.e., aminopenicillins, cephalosporins, co-trimoxazole, chloramphenicol, or furazolidone within the previous 7 days), pneumococcal vaccination status (receipt of >1 dose of PCV7), and calendar month. Because viral infections could lead to rhinorrhea, we did not directly include this variable in our main regression model, and rhinorrhea was considered as a potential variable in the causal pathway between viral infections and pneumococcal density changes. To examine the association of pneumococcal densities during asymptomatic periods with the risk for subsequent ARI, we conducted a survival analysis by using a frailty model and accounted for repeated measurements from individual children. Because severe ARI occurred uncommonly in this household surveillance study, we did not stratify the outcome variable (ARI) by severity (28). For this assessment, follow-up extended from the date of an asymptomatic nasopharyngeal sample collection (>8 days after the last day of ARI symptoms) through the earliest of the following: ARI, the collection of another nasopharyngeal sample, or 60 days after collection of the initial asymptomatic nasopharyngeal sample. These censoring criteria were implemented on the basis of our monthly nasopharyngeal collection strategy and the anticipated transient duration of colonization with an individual serotype in young children, typically 6\u20138 weeks or less (37\u201340). Because viral infection or its manifestation as rhinorrhea could modify the risk for subsequent ARI (41), alternate models accounted for either viral infections or rhinorrhea in addition to the aforementioned covariates. We applied restricted cubic splines (RCS) to log-transformed pneumococcal densities in our frailty model to relax the assumption of linearity in our models (42,43). The estimated effects of RCS-transformed densities are presented in figures. The proportional hazards assumption of the frailty model was examined and satisfied by using a Schoenfeld\u2019s global test. Statistical analyses were done in Stata version 14.2 (https://www.stata.com) and R version 3.5.0 (https://www.r-project.org), including lqmm and survival packages.",

We now report that those associations are not restricted to periods of symptomatic disease and demonstrate an increased risk for ARI with increasing pneumococcal density during asymptomatic periods as well. Of interest, increased pneumococcal density was associated with the risk for subsequent ARI in a nonlinear manner and appeared particularly evident at higher pneumococcal densities (>104).

Our finding that increases in pneumococcal density during asymptomatic episodes were associated with increased likelihood of subsequent onset of these mostly mild, viral ARI might suggest a contributing role of colonizing pneumococci in these illnesses. Of note, this association only became significant at the highest levels of pneumococcal density. A previous study of young children with nasopharyngeal pneumococcal colonization indicated that higher colonization density was associated with high levels of markers of nasopharyngeal inflammation compared with children with lower-density colonization (44). We postulate that increased nasopharyngeal inflammation from increased pneumococcal density might facilitate viral infection of an exposed susceptible person. The hypothesis that nasopharyngeal pneumococcal colonization patterns and density might influence subsequent onset of nonpneumococcal ARI is also consistent with our observation that children who had received >1 PCV vaccination had a reduced risk for ARI following asymptomatic viral detection compared with unvaccinated children.",

Specifically, children with viral infection or rhinorrhea had a lower incidence of subsequent ARI than children without viral infection or rhinorrhea. The mechanism of this association is unclear but might involve the phenomenon of viral interference, in which infection with 1 virus prevents or mitigates infection with a different virus, perhaps through the induction of proinflammatory cytokines or other immune mediators (41), because the presence of rhinorrhea might indicate a viral infection with a virus detected or not detected in our study. Rhinitis has also been shown to occur after intranasal inoculation of pneumococcus in healthy adults and in mouse models (45), and nasal discharge has been associated with pneumococcal detection even in the absence of respiratory viral infection (46), suggesting that an inflammatory response might be an important component of early pneumococcal colonization, which might have important host consequences. Furthermore, several studies have also demonstrated the role of normal airway mucus and nasal secretions in lining epithelial surfaces and trapping and removing pathogens from the airway through mucociliary clearance (47,48), potentially providing an effective barrier to acquisition of new respiratory viruses, bacteria, or both.",

            "text": "In spite of the strengths of our longitudinal design, our study has several limitations. Because detection of viruses other than HRV and AdV during asymptomatic periods was uncommon in our cohort, the power to detect associations with these other specific viruses and pneumococcal densities was low. HRV was detected in >80% of samples in which >1 virus was detected, limiting inferences about co-detections with other viruses. Because of enhanced sensitivity of rRT-PCR for detection of respiratory viruses relative to culture, it might be difficult to interpret the clinical significance of detection of HRV and AdV by PCR in asymptomatic children (i.e., whether these detections might represent prolonged shedding from a prior illness or a recent asymptomatic infection). The study was conducted in a rural region in which the incidence of pneumonia is higher than national rates (28,49). However, incidence of other common respiratory diseases, such as otitis media, sinusitis, and other types of respiratory illnesses, was not available. Highest densities were observed during the 2009 mid-spring season, but examination of several consecutive seasons would be useful to clarify the role of seasonality in our observations. In our assessment of the role of colonization density during asymptomatic periods on the risk for subsequent ARI, we did not systematically assess for pneumococcal colonization or density during the subsequent ARI, so direct density comparisons were not possible between the asymptomatic and subsequent ARI periods. Furthermore, we must note that several factors might play a role in increases in pneumococcal colonization density. A recent study from Kenya found that increases in density associated with viral detection were modest relative to the baseline variation in density in individual patients (50) and postulated that other factors, such as the host immune response to previous viral infections (6,7,27), also play an important role in the association between high levels of pneumococcal density and risk for subsequent ARI. However, the potential influence of immune, genetic, or other environmental factors on subsequent ARI risk was not measured in our study. Also, the associations observed with pneumococcal density might be serotype-specific, but serotype information was not available for those samples from patients with subsequent ARI. Furthermore, interactions between pneumococcus and other colonizing nasopharyngeal bacteria might play an important role in the host response to pneumococcal acquisition as well as the dynamics of pneumococcal density and pathogenesis (29), but associated changes in the nasopharyngeal microbiome were not assessed in this study. The presence of an asymptomatic viral infection was associated with a lower risk for subsequent symptomatic ARI in this study. Although we postulate that such a relationship might have a time-limited impact, our study was set up with a short follow-up time and was not designed to determine the duration of this association. Additional studies that have a longer follow-up time and are specifically designed to determine the temporality of the observed association would be useful. Future studies will assess the relationship between viral detection and serotype and density patterns over time in individual patients, along with associated changes in the respiratory microbiome during both asymptomatic and ARI periods. Finally, our study did not assess transmission patterns of colonizing pneumococci. Whether the increase in densities associated with viral detection have an impact on transmission is unclear.",
