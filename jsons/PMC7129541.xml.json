Certain socio-environmental factors, like attendance at day-care centers, are known risk factors for recurring respiratory infections and otitis media, but no unifying biological cause has been discovered for the situation except in very rare cases of primary immunodeficiency (Lyall et al., 1991).",

            "text": "Interferons (IFN) are considered to have a key role in animal host defense against virus infections (Muller et al., 1994). Type I IFNs are synthesized in most nucleated cells as a response to virus infection and comprise several subtypes of IFN-\u03b1, a closely related IFN-\u03c9 and the more distantly related IFN-\u03b2. Production of IFN-\u03b3 (type II IFN) is limited to cells of bone marrow origin. It is produced by activated T-lymphocytes and NK cells, but, according to recent reports, also by cells of the myeloid line. Previous studies have shown that induction of IFN-\u03b1 expression is under genetic control in mice (Muller et al., 1994), whereas regulation of IFN-\u03b1 production in humans has not been studied extensively. Leukocyte cultures derived from different donors are known to vary remarkably with respect to the yields of IFN induced by standard amounts of viruses (Katschinski et al., 1994). Reduced yields of virus-induced IFN by leukocyte cultures were previously associated with recurrent respiratory infections in children (Isaacs et al., 1981; Bondestam et al., 1984; Vanecek and Lehovcova, 1985; Pitk\u00e4ranta et al., 1993, Pitk\u00e4ranta et al., 1996). However, in these case-control studies the baseline IFN-responsiveness of the leukocytes of these children was not available and the question remained uncertain whether the decreased IFN response reflected an underlying predisposition or was secondary to the recurrent respiratory infections.",

Our aim was to identify the most infection-prone quintile of the entire cohort of 329 children. The number of URIs and AOM episodes experienced by each child was counted. After reviewing these data, we concluded that the highest quintile had experienced at least nine URIs and/or at least four AOM episodes during the follow-up.

Moreover, in this analysis only such events were taken into account as AOM events, in which the presence of middle ear effusion was confirmed by collection of at least one middle ear fluid sample.

Mononuclear leukocytes were stored frozen at \u221270\u00b0C in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum containing 20% DMSO until assayed for IFN responsiveness. To study virus-induced IFN production, leukocytes were thawed rapidly, sedimented to remove DMSO containing medium and resuspended in growth medium at 2\u00d7106 cells/ml. Leukocyte cultures were then inoculated with standard amounts of adenovirus type 7a, human coronavirus 229E, human rhinovirus (a clinical isolate provided by T. Ziegler), and influenza A Beijing/353/89/H3N2 (a gift from R. Pyh\u00e4l\u00e4) as reported earlier (Pitk\u00e4ranta et al., 1993). A single preparation of each virus was used throughout the study stored at \u221270\u00b0C as small aliquots. Culture medium for IFN assay was harvested on day 2 and clarified by centrifugation. The supernatants were stored at \u221270\u00b0C until assayed. For logistic reasons, we could not use freshly isolated leukocytes in the induction assays. The feasibility of using frozen cells was tested in advance with cells from several volunteers. The absolute yields of IFN were usually two-fold lower from frozen-thawed cell preparations than those in the corresponding fresh cultures, but the donor-specific pattern of IFN yields induced by different viruses was retained (data not shown).",

The studies did not determine whether this deficiency reflected a genetic trend to increased susceptibility to respiratory infections or was a secondary consequence of the frequent illnesses. The present study was designed to investigate the correlation in a prospective set-up. As a group, leukocytes from the 18 children with frequent illnesses (\u22659 URI and/or \u22654 AOM) produced decreased IFN amounts when compared to the IFN production by leukocytes from 53 children with less frequent illnesses (\u22648 URI and/or \u22643 AOM). A similar pattern existed at 6 months and 2 years of age with respect to IFN responsiveness to rhinovirus. The findings suggest that the impaired IFN production in some FRRI children might indeed be a genetic property. We also made a comparison of IFN yields between the children with FRRI and those with no or maximally one URI during the follow-up period. The differences in IFN responsiveness were even greater than in the primary comparison, a finding which further supports the view that the inherent intensity of the virus-induced IFN response might play a role in the susceptibility to URI and/or AOM. Of note, there are many examples of genetically determined aberrations in the production of other cytokines that result in increased severity of other infections (McGuire et al., 1994; Stuber et al., 1996; Westendorp et al., 1997), including such a common disease as periodontitis (Kornman et al., 1997).",

It is noteworthy, that the overall IFN yields obtained with the influenza A virus in our study are much higher than those seen with the other viruses revealing the difference between the groups of children. Influenza viruses are very effective IFN inducers which may mask differences in production capacity. In addition to the virus inducer-specific differences, there were also great interindividual variations in IFN yields. This makes it difficult to use the IFN producing capacity as such as a prognostic marker for recurrent respiratory infections at the individual level.",
