With the continuous spread of the new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic in even the world, prevention and treatment of the disease have become urgent tasks. The drugs currently being developed are not adequate to deal with this critical situation. In addition to being controlled through effective isolation, we need a rapid response from the healthcare and biotechnology industries to accelerate drug treatment research. By reviewing the currently available literature published at home and abroad, we summarize the current research progress of drug treatment during the epidemic period. At present, the drugs that can be used for treatment mainly include antiviral drugs, antimalarials, glucocorticoids, plasma therapy, biological agents, and traditional Chinese medicine. The effectiveness and safety of drug therapy need to be confirmed by more clinical studies.",

            "text": "On December 31, 2019, an unknown outbreak spread from Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, and spread rapidly worldwide (1) . The main clinical symptoms of this unexplained pneumonia are similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which can quickly develop from mild fever, fatigue, and dyspnea to severe pneumonia. Starting from the management experience of the SARS epidemic, China has rapidly carried out comprehensive prevention and control. On January 7, 2020, China officials officially announced that it would temporarily name the unexplained pathogen in Wuhan as 2019-novel coronavirus (nCoV) (2, 3) . The confirmed cases reported from outside China support human-to-human transmission (4, 5) , which indicates that the outbreak is difficult to control (6, 7) . After two meetings on January 30, 2020 (January 22 and January 23, respectively), the World Health Organization regarded the outbreak of the 2019-nCoV as a public health emergency (8, 9) . Although the development of vaccines has long-term prevention and control effects, rapid identification of drug treatment during the epidemic is the key to responding to the outbreak (10), and there is no clear treatment method at present (11) . Studies have found that 2019-nCoV is a single-stranded RNA beta coronavirus similar to SARS and MERS (12) , so current treatment is mainly based on the treatment experience of these two diseases (13) and further development of new targeted drugs. Currently, the drugs studied for the treatment of 2019-nCoV mainly include antivirals, antimalarials, glucocorticoids, plasma therapy, biological agents, and traditional Chinese medicine, among which lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, remdesivir, chloroquine phosphate, and interferon are the main drugs. Here, we systematically review the current research that can be used in the treatment of 2019-nCoV, providing a theoretical basis for the next step of treatment and prevention.",

It is considered that the half-life of lopinavir can be increased by inhibiting cytochrome P450, thereby enhancing the antiviral effect. Lopinavir/ritonavir is a known antiretroviral drug targeting the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which is being evaluated for anti-2019-nCoV treatment (16) . A randomized controlled clinical study of the effect of 2019-nCoV cases (ChiCTR2000029308) is also underway (17, 18) . At present, the National Health Council has recommended the use of lopinavir and ritonavir as antivirus regimens for 2019-nCoV-related pneumonia.

Previous studies have shown that monoclonal antibodies can remarkably improve the MERS-CoV infection (51) . Research by Mark et al. shows that monoclonal antibodies REGN-EB3 and mAb114 can significantly reduce the mortality of patients with Ebola (28) . Reviewing the recently research progress, it is suggested that monoclonal antibodies can be used for the treatment of 2019-nCoV (52) . However, no relevant monoclonal antibodies have been successfully marketed yet (53) . It is mainly based on the latest experiments that the CR3022 can effectively bind to the 2019-nCoV receptor-binding domain (50) that mainly targets the spike protein and inhibits the virus from attaching to the host cell, thereby preventing the virus from invading. Through this passive immunotherapy, it makes the treatment more targeted, and it is conducive to the development of vaccines (53) .",
