[1] The emergence of clinically significant resistance is occurring within only a few years after the deployment of any new antibiotic. It has been estimated that about 70% of the hospital-acquired infections are resistant to one or more current antibiotic treatments. [2] These infections have significant impact on treatment failures, longer hospital stays, and health care costs. A significant number of newly developed antibiotics represent minor alterations to wellknown chemical scaffolds and are therefore particularly prone to resistance.

[14] In addition, they should produce minimal toxicity and aspire to decrease the emergence of drug-resistant strains of microorganisms. [15, 16] Producing NPs at a low cost and on a large-scale level is necessary for commercially viability, particularly in less-developed countries. In summary, the traits of an ideal antimicrobial NP carrier includes: drug protection from degradation, improved bioavailability, controlled release for a sustained concentration, specific targeting of diseased site, overcoming anatomical or cellular barriers, minimal toxicity, decreased emergence of drug-resistant, low cost, and scalable production. [17] [18] [19] The purpose of this review is to summarize the published work on antimicrobial NPs and their therapeutic potential for combating resistant pathogens. With the increase emergence of mutated strains of microbes, such as the recently discovered coronavirus H7N9, coating of face masks with NPs may be a useful preventive measure for health care workers and civilians. In a study carried out by Li et al., ten treated and untreated masks with a mixture of Ag NPs and TiO 2 NPs were tested against E. coli and S. aureus. [20] No growth was reported on the treated masks after 48 h incubation while the untreated masks showed an increase in bacterial numbers. Wound dressing is another important area of investigation. Bacterial cellulose fibers do not possess antimicrobial activity. However, upon incorporation of Ag NPs into the fibers, they exhibited a strong antimicrobial response against E. coli and S. aureus. [21] NPs have proven to overcome some of the shortcomings of existing antibiotics include having relatively short half-lives, low bioavailability, and possible toxic side effects. [22] For example, gentamicin was previously studied in different NP drug delivery system such as poly (lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) and chitosan. [23, 24] It was observed that NPs carrying gentamicin aided in the drug delivery to specific sites and with sustained release of the drug. [25] In addition, the encapsulation of antibiotics within NPs was observed to reduce their toxic side effects relative to conventional administration.

[28] Silver and its compounds can possess potent bactericidal activity and have been developed into NPs for potential drug treatments. [29] The antimicrobial efficacy of silver NPs is determined by size, shape, and nature of the capping agents. A linear correlation has been observed between size of the silver NPs and the minimum inhibitory concentration for both Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains. [30] Ag NPs have been shown to kill yeast by disrupting its plasma membrane and thus affecting the membrane potential of the cells. Amphotericin B (AmB) was used as a positive control and the plasma membrane DPH fluorescence anisotropy of Candida albicans displayed a significant decrease as the concentrations of Ag NPs and AmB increased. [31, 32] This result was consistent with the disruption of the plasma membrane by Ag NPs and AmB. In the same study, Ag NPs exhibited a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 2 \u00b5g mL \u22121 , which is similar to that exhibited by AmB (2.5-5 \u00b5g mL \u22121 ). [32] Moreover, nano-Ag caused less hemolysis of erythrocytes (6% lysis) compared to AmB (10% lysis) at the same concentration. [32] Ag NPs display average MIC values of 4.86 \u00b5g mL \u22121 compared to 500 \u00b5g mL \u22121 for ZnO NPs and 197 \u00b5g mL \u22121 for Au NPs against Streptococcus mutans. [33] Ag NPs are also found to possess antiviral properties. [34] This may prove to be an important finding in view of the rising numbers of virus-related deaths worldwide. Viruses are highly adaptable and able to switch to a new host to overcome antiviral mechanisms. [35] \u22482.5 million people were newly infected with human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV) in 2011 (WHO), bringing the number of people living with HIV to a total of 34 million in 2011. About 1.7 million acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) deaths were reported in the same year. Ag NPs are viricidal, not only to cell-free HIV-1 but also to cell-associated HIV-1, based on viral infectivity assays. [36] These NPs appear to block viral entry through gp120-CD4 interactions in the pre-infection stage. In another study, poly(N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone) (PVP)-coated Ag NPs were investigated as a potential topical vaginal microbicide against HIV-1 infection. [37] Cervical tissues were exposed to the nonspermicidal gel with PVPcoated Ag NPs for 48 h and did not display signs of toxicity. A 1 min pretreatment of the gel prevented the transmission of HIV-1 isolates, and a 20 min treatment followed by a thorough washing of the drug protected the tissues from HIV-1 infection for 48 h. [37] The emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria has become a major threat to public health. A recent study showed that coating Au nanoparticles with cationic and hydrophobic functional groups could suppress the growth of both Gramnegative and Gram-positive uropathogens, including MDR pathogens (Figure 3) . [38] This result revealed that surface chemistry plays an important role in Au NP antimicrobial activity, providing a rational design element to develop new antibiotic NPs. Taken together with the high biocompatibility and slow development of resistance through generations, the use of functionalized Au NPs reported in this study provides a promising approach for t combating MDR infections.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 151, "end": 155, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 286, "end": 290, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 557, "end": 561, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 897, "end": 901, "text": "[31,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 902, "end": 905, "text": "32]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1149, "end": 1153, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1276, "end": 1280, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1427, "end": 1431, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1487, "end": 1491, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1695, "end": 1699, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2104, "end": 2108, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2358, "end": 2362, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2686, "end": 2690, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3003, "end": 3007, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2990, "end": 3000, "text": "(Figure 3)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "Antimicrobial Metallic Nanoparticles"}, {"text": "Copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) also exhibit a strong ability to inhibit microbes. Cu NPs are easy to develop and eco-friendly, and their effectiveness against pathogenic bacteria, algae, and viruses has been demonstrated (Figure 4 ). [39] It has been proposed that Cu NPs act against a wide spectrum of bacterial species by interactions with \ue0c6SH groups, which results in [27] Copyright 2014, Elsevier. www.advancedsciencenews.com www.advhealthmat.de protein denaturation. They also exhibit a high affinity with and amines and carboxyl groups present on the cell membrane. After penetration, the Cu NPs can disturb the structure of DNA by cross-linking nucleic acid strands, which also results in bacterial cell death. Table 1 summarizes some of the most studied metallic NPs and their antimicrobial mechanism of action. Metallic NPs can also be functionalized with antimicrobial surface molecules. The advantages of these NPs include producing longer lasting antimicrobial effectiveness and ensuring that microbes encountering the antimicrobials drugs are exposed to only the high surface concentrations. Silica nanoparticles (SNP) have been functionalized with AmB, for example. SNPs were chosen for their low toxicity, high stability, durability, and ease of modification to allow the incorporation of an array of different functional molecules. [54, 55] SNPs incorporating DexOxAmB were found to totally eliminate C. albicans. [55] AmB is known to cause a degree of hemolysis. However, when it is immobilized, no significant release of hemoglobin was observed. [55] In the same study, SNPs functionalized with AmB were found to be more effective against C. albicans than silver nanoparticles.

[59, 60] Polymeric NPs include poly-lactic acid (PLA), polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA), poly-d-l-glycolide (PLG), PLGA, polycaprolactone (PCL), and poly-cyanoacrylate (PCA), which are biodegradable. [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] These NPs are in general cleared rapidly from the blood system by phagocytic cells, thereby minimizing bioaccumulation and associated side effects. [66] Hence, it is also necessary for surface modification to escape or delay phagocytic clearance. [67] Polymeric NPs can be modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG) to improve blood circulation half-life. [68, 69] Yuan et al. have reported the synthesis and antibacterial properties of biodegradable poly(ethylene oxide)-poly(\u03b5-caprolactone)poly[(2-tert-butylaminoethyl) methacrylate] (PEO-PCL-PTBAM) ( Figure 5 ). [70] In this study, the desired triblock copolymers were synthesized by a two-step reaction process, including ring opening polymerization (ROP) to prepare PEO-PCL diblock copolymer, followed by a chain extension of PTBAM via atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). The presence of hydrophobic PCL segments provided the driving force for the copolymer to self-assemble into micelles, and also imparted biodegradability, whereas PEGylation afforded better biocompatibility and colloidal stability. PEO-PCL-PTBAM micelles are inherently antibacterial and membrane-active despite the absence of quaternary ammonium groups. This is because of the presence of secondary amines in the PTBAM block, which are cationic under physiological conditions. In addition, the utilization of PTBAM can circumvent the significant hemolytic effects of quaternary ammonium-based antimicrobial materials. Antimicrobial testing showed that PEO-PCL-PTBAM copolymer with the highest PTBAM content exhibited the most potent More importantly, the optimal MIC values were much higher than its critical micellization concentration (CMC), indicating self-assembly is a prerequisite for the polymer to exhibit antimicrobial efficacy. [70] Many researches have also demonstrated the potential role of polymeric NPs for antimicrobial drug delivery. PLGA has been loaded with gentamicin, which is an aminoglycoside antibiotic used in the treatment of Pseudomonoas infections. [71] Data collected from this study showed that PLGA nanoparticles carrying gentamicin performed better than free gentamicin. The latter reduced P. aeruginosa infection after 24 h but the level of infection returned to levels comparable to saline-treated controls after 96 h. However, antimicrobial activity remained high even after 96 h when an equal concentration of gentamicin-loaded PLGA nanoparticles was used. [71] This result was further supported by the work of Peng et al. investigating the effectiveness of free voriconazole versus PLGA NPs loaded with voriconazole. It was found that PLGA NPs loaded with voriconazole showed greater potency in vivo and extended fungicidal times than free voriconazole in vitro. [72] Research on other microorganisms has similarly supported the advantages of polymeric NPs in drug delivery systems. Cavalli et al. investigated the efficacy of antiviral NPs loaded with acyclovir. Acyclovir is used to treat herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections. [73] However, acyclovir needs to be taken orally five times daily due to its short half-life (\u22482 h) and low bioavailability (about 15-30%). Polymeric NPs were prepared using a \u03b2-cyclodextrin-poly(a-acryloylmorpholine) monoconjugate (\u03b2-CD-PACM). Free acyclovir and acyclovir-loaded \u03b2-CD-PACM NPs were incubated with vero cells separately and the intracellular drug concentration was determined. It was found that the intracellular drug concentration was much higher in cells incubated with acyclovir-loaded \u03b2-CD-PACM NPs than for cells incubated with free acyclovir. [73] Likewise, HIV protease inhibitor saquinavir and nucleoside analog zalcitabine were loaded into polyhexycyanocrylate NPs. Free saquinavir displayed little antiviral activity at <10 \u00d7 10 \u22129 m against acutely infected human monocytes/macrophages cells, while saquinavir-loaded NPs showed good antiviral activity at 1 \u00d7 10 \u22129 m. However, zalcitabine loaded into NPs did not appear to enhance antiviral activity. Hence, it appears that protease inhibitor drugs may gain more from NPloading than nucleoside analogs.

SLNs are found to have occlusive excipients that form a thin film when applied to skin. This reduces evaporation, helping to retain skin moisture, and enhance molecule penetration. [93] Another advantage of SLNs is their stability in water and dermal creams, which makes it easier to incorporate them into cosmetic and skin care products. [94] SLNs are used topically.

Chattopadhyay et al. showed a higher drug uptake in the human brain endothelial cells (a representative of BBB) in vitro when atazanavir was delivered via SLNs. SLNs can be used for oral administration by producing them in powder form for pellets, capsules, or tablets. [99] Tobramycin-loaded SLNs displayed greater effectiveness against Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in the gastrointestinal tracts of patients with cystic fibrosis. [100] SLNs consist of natural components and do not require high-pressure homogenization and sophisticated machinery, [92] thereby allowing large-scale, inexpensive manufacturing. However, SLN formulations may be limited by unwanted \"burst release\" of the drug due to particle growth by agglomeration or coagulation. [92, 101] NLCs encompass an imperfect crystal or amorphous particle, which allows drug loading in the molecular form and in clustered aggregates. This enhances drug loading and gives rise to less pronounced \"burst release\" of the drug because of the reduced proportion of crystalline structures.

[59] Both polymers and drugs are first dissolved in a watermiscible organic solvent such as acetone or acetonitrile. The mixture is then added to an aqueous solution. As the organic solvent evaporates, the polymers and drugs undergo nanoprecipitation via rapid solvent diffusion, to produce NPs. [110] Alternatively, polymeric NPs can be prepared from linear polymers via an emulsion polymerization method. Monomers are first dissolved in polymerization media with surfactants, followed by the addition of polymerization initiators, resulting in the formation of nanocapsules. Antimicrobials are either absorbed into the NPs during this process or they can be covalently attached to the surface of the NPs after they are formed. Hydrophobic drugs are typically loaded via absorption while hydrophilic drugs are attached via covalent conjugation. [111] Table 5 summarizes the reported methods for preparing polymeric NPs. Different preparation methods and different compositions of liposomes contribute to their efficacy as antimicrobial carriers. Electrospray can produce a broad array of NPs. This technique generates monodisperse droplets in sizes ranging from nanometers to micrometers (depending on the processing parameters).

A good balance of lipoplex productivity, size, and surface charge can be achieved by adjusting processing parameters. The lipoplexes produced can be used for intravenous injection or as aerosol for inhalation therapy. SLNs and NLCs can be produced using several methods which are summarized in Table 7 . Highpressure homogenization (HPH) is arguably the most effective technique yielding a narrow particle size distribution, avoiding the use of organic solvents and is scalable.
