The posterior wall consists of the trachealis muscle and fibrous connective tissue with an average wall thickness of 1-3 mm. The normal transverse internal diameter of the trachea is 15 to 25 mm in males and 10 to 21 mm in females. More distally in the tracheobronchial tree, bronchi are differentiated from bronchioles by the presence of cartilage in bronchial walls. Blood to the trachea is supplied through the inferior thyroid, bronchial, and intercostal arteries. The trachea is innervated by the recurrent laryngeal nerve3, 4, 5 (Fig 1\n).",

However radiography is of low sensitivity in the detection of tracheobronchial pathologies, and many lesions can be missed. Multidetector computed tomography is the modality of choice to investigate suspected airway pathologies. The advantages of CT include excellent spatial resolution and the ability to generate multiplanar reformats and three dimensional (3D) reconstructions, CT allows for rapid and noninvasive evaluation of the tracheobronchial tree. Importantly, with current CT detectors, the spatial resolution is preserved in the axial, coronal, and sagittal planes. Multidetector computed tomography is an excellent diagnostic tool to find, localize, and investigate the extent of airway pathologies with both local and distant disease involvement. Virtual bronchoscopy using 3D reconstruction from CT images is a useful diagnostic tool that offers a noninvasive technique for investigation of the tracheobronchial tree.6, 7\n",

Irregular margins are seen as the tumor arises from the surface epithelium, often with mediastinal invasion by direct extension or lymphatic spread.

In less than 5% of the time, carcinoid can present with symptoms of carcinoid syndrome, including flushing, diarrhea, and wheezing. On CT, endobronchial carcinoids present as well-defined spherical or oval lesions with lobulated borders and intense contrast enhancement. Twenty-five percent of carcinoid tumors contain calcification. On MR, these tumors are T2 hyperintense and T1 hypointense with evidence of avid enhancement on postcontrast sequence. FDG-PET is of limited utility as that carcinoid are often associated with minimal uptake. The somatostatin avid PET radiotracer 68-Ga DOTA-TATE PET/CT received US FDA approval in June 2016 and demonstrated a higher level of uptake in carcinoid. The higher resolution of PET-CT can also be advantageous as compared to 111-In pentetreotide SPECT-CT.
