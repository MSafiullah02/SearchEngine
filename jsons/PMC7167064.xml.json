The segments investigated in this study included cervical (C), thoracic (T), lumbar (L), and sacral (S) spinal cord. For reverse transcription\u2010polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR), fresh spinal cord tissue samples obtained at autopsy were immediately snap\u2010frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use. The small intestine, which was reported to contain abundant CFTR in cell membrane of the mucosa cells (Strong et al.,1994), was taken as a positive control from the same cases and treated with the same protocol as for the spinal cord tissue. For immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, specimens were fixed in 4% formalin solution for 24 hr and then embedded in paraffin blocks. The pancreas tissue, in which CFTR expression was confirmed, was taken as a positive control for immunohistochemistry.",

Briefly, the SYBR green dye was added into the mix (Mg2+ and Taq DNA polymerase already added), followed by the cDNA template (2 \u03bcl RT product for 20 \u03bcl reaction volume), and sense and antisense primers (6 \u03bcmol for both primers for 20 \u03bcl reaction volume). The PCR was carried out by using the DNA Engine Opticon Continuous Fluorescence Detection System (MJ Research, Waltham, MA). The reaction system was optimized and checked by performing standard curves running on serial dilutions of cDNA (R2 > 0.98). The PCRs were optimized also by comparing Cts among duplicate samples (difference of Cts <0.5). The primers for CFTR PCR were as follows: sense primer 5\u2032\u2010AGGAGGAACGCTCTATCG\u20103\u2032, antisense primer 5\u2032\u2010GCAGACGCCTGTAACAAC\u20103\u2032. The PCR product of CFTR should be 328 base pairs. The GAPDH gene was taken as an endogenous control to evaluate the CFTR gene expression levels. The primers for GAPDH were as follows: sense primer 5\u2032\u2010ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC\u20103\u2032, antisense primer 5\u2032\u2010TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA\u20103\u2032. The PCR product of GAPDH should be 452 base pairs. Different primer concentrations in the suggested range by the Taq DNA polymerase manufacturer's protocol were tested. The optimal concentrations of primers were used for the quantitative real\u2010time PCR analysis. The amplification of PCR began with a hot\u2010start reaction for 10 min at 94\u00b0C and then proceeded for 40 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 30 sec, 54\u00b0C for 30 sec, and 72\u00b0C for 30 sec, followed by fluorescent measurements in each cycle. The final cycle was followed by a 72\u00b0C extension for 5 min. A melt curve analysis step was done following PCR. The PCRs for CFTR and GAPDH gene were performed with the same conditions. To verify the PCR product and exclude nonspecific amplification, melt curve analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis were performed. A 100\u2010bp DNA ladder, Marker 1 (MD101; Tiangen), was used as a DNA weigh standard in the agarose gel electrophoresis. To assess whether the difference in mRNA level in the different tissues was statistically significant, one\u2010way ANOVA was performed.",

            "text": "Originally, CFTR was thought to be present only in epithelial cells (Kerem et al.,1989; Riordan et al.,1989), and the function of CFTR in these cells has been extensively studied (Hasegawa et al.,1992; Bradbury,1999; Mehta,2005). Recently, expression of CFTR in nonepithelial cells was reported. These nonepithelial cells include the macrophages, lymphocytes, neutrophils, smooth muscle cells, and neurons (Fonknechten et al.,1992; Johannesson et al.,1997; Di et al.,2006; Painter et al.,2006; Vandebrouck et al.,2006). Mulberg and associates (1994) reported expression of CFTR in neurons of the rat brain. They also reported that CFTR was associated with clathrin\u2010coated vesicles (CCV) in neurons of the hypothalmus of the bovine brain. Bradbury and associates reported CFTR protein within subcellular compartments of the T84 cell line, possibly within synaptic or clathrin\u2010coated vesicles, which might be involved in neuropeptide transport or other molecular trafficking (Bradbury et al.,1994; Mulberg et al.,1994). However, in the human nervous system, CFTR has previously been reported only in the anterior hypothalamus (Mulberg et al.,1995,1998; Weyler et al.,1999) but not in the spinal cord. Here we found the expression and localization of CFTR in human spinal cord at both the mRNA and the protein levels. This is the first report that CFTR is extensively present in neurons of the human spinal cord.",

            "text": "The significance of CFTR expression in neurons throughout the human spinal cord is twofold. First, it suggests that this molecule may play a role in normal function of the human spinal cord, particularly in view of its previously identified cellular functions and physiology. For example, as a phosphorylation\u2010dependent epithelial chloride channel, CFTR is expressed in the plasma membrane and membrane of organelles (Denning et al.,1992; Mohamed et al.,1997; Benharouga et al.,2003), and plays a key role in regulating the steady state of cellular electrolytes via regulation of salt transport, fluid flow, and ion concentrations (Egan et al.,1992; Sheppard and Welsh,1999). It has been proposed that CFTR could regulate the activity of membrane proteins through direct protein\u2013protein interactions (Stutts et al.,1995) or by modulating membrane trafficking (Prince et al.,1994). CFTR can also mediate ATP hydrolysis, thereby regulating the flux of glutathione (GSH), which in turn serves in the regulation of protein/enzyme function (Kogan et al.,2003). It also functions as a neuromodulator and neurotransmitter (Janaky et al.,1999). It has been reported that CFTR is critical for cAMP\u2010dependent regulation of membrane recycling (Bradbury et al.,1992). The interactions among three important molecules, CFTR, adenosine triphosphate, and glutathione, may profoundly affect neuronal function (Aoyama et al.,2008; Yue et al.,2008). After detection of CFTR in the hypothalamus, it was proposed that CFTR might be involved in regulating energy utilization, sexual maturation, and reproductive behavior (Mulberg et al.,1995,1998; Weyler et al.,1999). The results of these studies provide a link between CFTR and neuronal functions of the central nervious system.",

            "text": "Second, mutation or alteration of this molecule may induce CNS dysfunction in CF or other neural diseases. More than 1,500 mutations of CFTR gene have been identified in CF (Radpour et al.,2008). Different mutations can result in different disorders, including the failure of CFTR trafficking to the cell membrane, reduced channel activity, and abnormal splicing of the CFTR mRNA (McAuley and Elborn,2000). When these mutations of the CFTR gene occur as in CF, the functions of CFTR in neurons may be altered, thus affecting the normal CNS function. Dystrophic axons in the nucleus gracilis and demyelination of the fasciculus gracilis have been reported in CF patients, with 66% developing dystrophic axons (Cavalier and Gambetti,1981). Subclinical extrapyramidal hemosiderosis has also been reported in CF (Wongmongkolrit et al.,1985). Such findings cannot be explained by the pathological changes in the lungs or other organs typically associated with CF. Mutant CFTR may accumulate in the cytoplasm that could block the molecular transmission in the cell (Gentzsch et al.,2007). Accumulation and failure in the transmission of molecules could cause cell dystrophy (Gentzsch et al.,2007). Furthermore, Cl\u2013 homeostasis determines the efficacy of synaptic inhibition in the motoneurons (Ueno et al.,2002). CFTR, as a Cl\u2013 channel, has been suggested to participate in the control of Cl\u2013 homeostasis and neuronal excitability in rat spinal cord (Ostroumov et al.,2007). Our results of expression of CFTR in human spinal cord provide a basis for the relationship between CFTR mutation and the neuronal symptoms seen in CF.",
