Both are match-based metrics (so the higher the score, the better the quality of the system) where the MT output is compared against a human reference. The way this is typically done is to 'hold out' a small part of the training data as test material, 9 where the human-translated target sentence is used as the reference against which the MT hypothesis is compared. BLEU does this by computing n-gram overlap, i.e. how many words, 2-, 3and 4-word sequences are contained in both the reference and hypothesis. 10 There is some evidence (Shterionov et al., 2018 ) that word-based metrics such as BLEU are unable to sufficiently demonstrate the difference in performance between MT systems, 11 so in addition, we use chrF (Popovi\u0107, 2015) , a character-based metric which is more discriminative. Instead of matching word n-grams, it matches character n-grams (up to 6). 9 Including test data in the training material will unduly influence the quality of the MT system, so it is essential that the test set is disjoint from the data used to train the MT engines.",

However, in an attempt to improve the quality of our engines, we extracted parallel sentences from large bitexts that are similar to the styles of texts we aim to translate, and use them to fine-tune our baseline MT systems. For this, we followed the state-of-the-art sentence selection approach of Axelrod et al. (2011) that extracts 'pseudo in-domain' sentences from large corpora using bilingual crossentropy difference over each side of the corpus (source and target). The bilingual cross-entropy difference is computed by querying in-and outof-domain (source and target) language models. Since our objective is to facilitate translation ser-vices for recommendations for the general public, non-experts, and medical practitioners in relation to COVID-19, we wanted our in-domain language models to be built on such data. Accordingly, we crawled sentences from a variety of government websites (e.g. HSE, 15 NHS, 16 Italy's Ministry for Health and National Institute of Health, 17 Ministry of Health of Spain, 18 and the French National Public Health Agency) 19 that offer recommendations and information on COVID-19. In Table 5 , we report the statistics of the crawled corpora used for in-domain language model training. The so-called now on we refer to as the \"ParaWiki Corpus\". First, we chose the Italian-to-English translation direction to test our data selection strategy on EMEA and ParaWiki corpora. Once the best set-up had been identified, we would use the same approach to prepare improved MT systems for the other translation pairs. We report the BLEU and chrF scores obtained on a range of different Italian-to-English NMT systems on both the TAUS and Reco test sets in Table 6. The second row in Table 6 Italian-to-English baseline NMT system fine-tuned on the training data from the TAUS Corona Crisis Corpus along with 300K sentence-pairs from the EMEA Corpus using the aforementioned sentenceselection strategy. We see that this strategy brings about moderate gains on both test sets over the baseline; however, these gains are not statistically significant (Koehn, 2004) . Currey et al. (2017) generated synthetic parallel sentences by copying target sentences to the source. This method was found to be useful where scripts are identical across the source and target languages. In our case, since the Sketch Engine Corpus is prepared from the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19), 23 it includes keywords and terms related to COVID-19, which are often used verbatim across the languages of study in this paper, so we contend that this strategy can help translate terms correctly. Accordingly, we carried out an experiment by adding sentences of the Sketch Engine Corpus (English monolingual corpus) to the TAUS Corona Crisis Corpus following the method of Currey et al. (2017) , and fine-tune the model on this training set. The scores for the resulting NMT system are shown in the third row of Table 6 . While this method also brings about moderate improvements on the Reco test set, it is not statistically significant. Interestingly, this approach also significantly lowers the system's performance on the TAUS test set, according to both metrics. Nonetheless, given the urgency of the situation in which we found ourselves, where the MT systems needed to be built as quickly as possible, the approach of Currey et al. (2017) can be viewed as a worthwhile alternative to the back-translation strategy of Sennrich et al. (2016a) which needs a high-quality back-translation model to be built, and the target corpus to be translated into the source language, both of which are time-demanding tasks.",

More importantly, while we cannot beat the online systems in terms of BLEU score, we are now in the same ballpark.

The main advantage of the online systems is fluency, as shown in example 5, where our system treated the German verb \"werden\" as a future tense auxiliary verb rather than a passive voice auxiliary. Example 6 represents a very rare case where our engine omitted one part of the source sentence altogether, thus not conveying all of the original meaning in the target translation. Table 10 shows translation examples for Frenchto-English. Again, lexical choice is often better in our MT hypotheses (example 1). Sometimes, our system outperforms one of the online systems, but not both (examples 2 and 3). Online systems outperform our system mainly in terms of fluency (examples 4, 5 and 6)).

Interestingly, our system's output misses the plural form of the first noun (\"some coronavirus\" instead of \"Some Coronaviruses\" as given by the other two MT systems, which is more precise), which gives rise to a slight inaccuracy, even though the overall meaning is still perfectly clear. Another interesting point is the preposition corresponding to the Italian \"tra familiari\", which is omitted by our system, but translated by Google as \"between family members\", compared to Bing's inclusion of \"among\". Overall, omitting the preposition does not alter the meaning, and these differences seem irrelevant to the clarity of the message.

Our system translates this correctly with the English equivalent \"if the mother is paucisymptomatic\", while Google gives the opposite meaning by missing the negative prefix, which would cause a serious misunderstanding, i.e. \"If the mother is symptomatic\", and Bing invents a word with \"if the mother is paucysy\", which is clearly incomprehensible. Interestingly, the human reference English translation for example 6 gives an overspecified (and potentially incorrect) rendition with \"If the mother is asymptomatic\", which is not quite an accurate translation of the Italian original, which refers to mothers showing few symptoms. The remaining translations in example 6 are broadly interchangeable, e.g. with regard to rendering \"neonato\" (literally \"newborn\") with \"infant\" (Google Translate) or \"newborn\" (our system and Bing's); the target sentences are correct and perfectly clear in all cases.

The webserver provides the user interface and distributes translation tasks. Users visit the online website and submit their translation requests to the webserver. When translation requests come in from a user, the webserver distributes the translation tasks to each MT server. The appropriate MT server carries out the translation and return the translation result to the webserver, which is then displayed to the user. Figure 2 shows the current interface to the 8 MT systems. The source and target languages can be selected from drop-down menus. Once the text is pasted into the source panel, and the Translate button clicked, the translation is instantaneously retrieved and appears in the target-language pane.

The tokeniser is an important module in the pipeline, as it is responsible for tokensing words, and separating tokens from punctuation symbols. The segmenter module segments words for specific languages. The compound splitter splits compound words for specific languages like German which fuses together constituent parts to form longer distinct words. The character normaliser is responsible for normalising characters. The lowercaser and truecaser module is responsible for lowercasing or truecasing words. The spellchecker checks for typographical errors and corrects them if necessary. Corresponding to these modules, we need a set of tools which perform the opposite operations: a detruecaser/recaser for detruecasing or recasing words after translation; a character denormaliser for certain languages; a compound rejoiner to produce compound words from subwords when translating into German; a desegmenter for producing a sequence from a set of segments; a detokeniser, which reattaches punctuation marks to words; and the DNT/TAG/URL module reinstates 'do not translate' entities, tags and URLS into the output translations.",
