Invasive pneumococcal disease cases were defined as the isolation of S pneumoniae from a normally sterile site (eg, blood, pleural fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, join fluid). The evidence of chest radiograph infiltrates and isolation of the bacteria from at least 1 of the following sites confirmed the diagnosis of pneumococcal pneumonia: blood, pleural fluid, or empyema. Because some cases of pneumonia can present with bacteremia, clinical syndromes were divided into isolated pneumonia, bacteremic pneumonia, and isolated bacteremia. Medical records of patients with culture-confirmed IPD at CMCD were reviewed for demographic and clinical data extraction. If a subject had recurrent IPD or multiple serotypes isolated, it was included in the analysis only once. All patient information was obtained in accordance with the Health Information Protection and Portability Act guidelines.",

Descriptive analyses were performed using medians, ranges, frequency distributions, and percentages. Incidence of IPD was calculated for each year using the sum of all hospitalized and emergency center patients, identified by unique medical record number, as the denominator. The Z-test was used to compare these rates at 0.05 significance level. A \u03c72 test and the Cochran\u2013Armitage Trend test for trend analysis were used to test the change in serotype and antibiotic susceptibility patterns over time. The data were stratified into vaccine serotype and nonvaccine serotype invasive disease. Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns were determined for all strains. The association between serotypes and the types of illnesses was determined by calculating odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals.

Our data provide information about the persistence of PCV7 serotypes in the PCV13 era. The most frequent PCV7 serotypes in our population were 19 F (38%) and 14 (31%).

            "text": "Comparison of trends on IPD after the introduction of each vaccine must be done cautiously. Vaccine uptake for PCV7 and PCV13 was different because PCV 7 was a new vaccine at introduction, and it took several years to reach vaccine uptake rates above 80% [4]. In addition, soon after PCV7 was licensed, several publications raised attention to the phenomenon of serotype replacement [5\u20137, 13]. There are data suggesting that the distribution of S pneumoniae serotypes in the community can evolve independently of the vaccine. This points to the importance of natural variations in serotype distribution unrelated to the vaccine and the ability of certain serotypes to fill the new ecologic niche. Natural trends in pneumococcal serotype colonization and the effect of antibiotic use should also be considered [22]. Observational studies have provided most of the available data regarding the serotype replacement. It is important to consider possible methodology issues such as ecologic and sampling bias that could affect the surveillance systems used by those studies. At the same time, changes in laboratory methods used in clinical practice or epidemiologic reporting tools can potentially influence observed changes in IPD incidence [22].",

Serotype 19A has been the most common replacement serotype reported in the literature since PCV7 was introduced [6, 18]. Likewise, serotype 19A was the most common vaccine serotype isolated in the PCV7 era in our study. The PCV13 era already shows progressive reduction in the frequency of this isolate. Zuccotti et al [13] reported 6C as the most frequent serotype causing IPD in Italy after PCV13 introduction. Serotype 6C has also been reported as a cause of IPD in the United States [8]. In our study, frequency of 6C isolates reached 25.5% of nonvaccine serotypes in the PCV13 era. Epidemiologic data from France suggests a strong impact of PCV13 on pediatric community-acquired pneumonia cases [11]. Lindstrand et al [10] showed that vaccination led to significant decrease of pneumonia cases for children 2 years of age and younger. Our data support these findings with the highest impact of both PCV seen in the overall incidence reduction of pneumonia cases and IPD in that age group. Investigators in Houston also reported reduction in PCV13 serotypes causing chronic sinusitis after the introduction of PCV13 [12].",

After vaccine introduction, the magnitude of the reduction of vaccine-related IPD due to serotypes has been consistent across sites. The increase in incidence of IPD caused by nonvaccine serotypes has been described to be more variable [23]. The most common non-PCV13 serotypes after vaccine introduction in our population were 23B, 6C, 23A, 9N/L and 12. Kaplan et al reported that their most common non-PCV13 serotypes causing IPD in 2010 and 2011 were 33F, 22F, 12, 15B, 15C, 23A, and 11 [3]. de St Maurice et al reported similar data to Kaplan's group regarding PCV13 era surveillance in the Tennessee area. The most common serotypes causing IPD in their population were 22F, 33, 12F, and 38 [24]. These data suggest variation in the serotype replacement phenomena according to geographic location within the United States [3]. It is of interest to note that data from the National Immunization Survey from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show the following average estimated vaccination coverage for PCV vaccine during PCV13 era: Dallas (79.3%), Houston (85.7%), Texas (83.3%), and Tennessee (84.9%) [25].",

Most of those samples belong to the pre-PCV era (1999\u20132000). We began prospective collection of samples from the CMCD microbiology laboratory late in 2000. In addition, MLST was not available starting 2011. However, only 2 isolates were classified as nontypeable during the PCV13 period. Our study was based on results from a single tertiary referral center, and hence, our findings may not be generalizable to other areas of the country. Children's Medical Center Dallas is the major referral center in the area, covering most of the pediatric population of the Dallas area. However, there are other medical centers, which were not included in the study, and the incidence of IPD could be overestimated or underestimated. Finally, although we could not associate vaccination status of individuals to development of IPD, we can point out that average PCV vaccination rates were slightly lower in the Dallas area compared with other areas of surveillance in the country.
