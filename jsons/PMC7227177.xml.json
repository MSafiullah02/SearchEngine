            "text": "In version 1 of 2020 NCCN Guidelines for Prostate Cancer, moderate hypofractionation regimens are indicated as preferred and several literature data demonstrate that, they are not inferior to standard fractionation (i.e. 74\u201381 Gy in 37\u201345 fractions) [9]. So, several schedules on 20\u201328 fractions (dose per fraction: 2.75\u20133 Gy) are widely adopted [10]. However, in the COVID-19 pandemic context, 20 fractions seem also demanding for obvious reasons not only for patients but also for the radiation department. A possible alternative is ultra-hypofractionated courses (6.1\u20138 Gy per fraction up to 5\u20137 fractions) that, to date, are considered an appropriate regimen option across all risk groups of patients (from very low to high and very high risk) (NCCN 2020, v1) [9]. It is well known that, in prostate cancer, radiation dose intensification correlates with better oncological outcomes and SBRT has shown acceptable efficacy and toxicity and has become \u201ca\u201d standard of care [11]. Despite the scientific evidence, SBRT has been exported and used only in large centers or in academic institutions but not taken into consideration in other radiotherapy centers although they have Hi-Tech accelerators [12]. The main concern is related to the risk of inducing severe late toxicity in patients with a good prognosis [13]. Here, we report the long-term results of a phase II multicenter prospective trial on Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy in low-risk prostate cancer patients. In this paper, we suggest that SBRT can be cost-effective with minimal toxicity and can therefore be offered more to patients, especially in emergency health conditions.",

Our analysis confirms that ultrahypofractionation schedule, as SBRT, in prostate cancer allows to obtain excellent result both in terms of acute and late toxicity and also in terms of oncological results. The literature data available to date have widely demonstrated that, SBRT in these patients is not only feasible, but it is also a valid therapeutic choice and it is included as an option in any risk class groups (NCCN guidelines) [9]. A recent meta-analysis of 38 prospective studies (for a total of 6116 patients in which the intermediate risk class was the most represented group), underlined this [15]. The acute toxicity rates reported in this meta-analysis were very low with acute grade \u2265 3 toxicity \u2264 1% (acute G3 GU toxicity in 0.5% of patients, no G4 GU toxicity and acute G3 GI toxicity in 0.06% of patients and G4 in 0.03%) and late \u2265 G3 GU toxicity of 2% and late G \u2265 3 GI toxicity of 1.1% [15]. Concerning the oncological outcomes, the reported overall 5-year bRFS rate was 95.3% (95% CI 91.3\u201397.5%), and 96.7% and 92.1% for the low and intermediate risk, respectively (bRFS is not available in patients at high risk because not all studies indicated division by risk classes) [15, 16]. Even our results are completely comparable with the data reported.",
