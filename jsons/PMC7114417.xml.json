They have been assigned to the subfamily Coronavirinae within the family Coronaviridae (de Groot et al., 2012a, Masters and Perlman, 2013). Together with the families Arteriviridae, Roniviridae, and Mesoniviridae, the Coronaviridae form the order Nidovirales (de Groot et al., 2012b). The family Coronaviridae is currently comprised of four genera called Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma- and Deltacoronavirus. Closely related virus species in these genera are grouped together in specific lineages. Coronaviruses infect mammals and birds and include pathogens of major medical, veterinary and economic interest (de Groot et al., 2012a), with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV) providing two prominent examples of newly emerging, highly pathogenic coronaviruses in humans (Drosten et al., 2003, Ksiazek et al., 2003, Zaki et al., 2012).",

            "text": "Besides their large genome sizes, coronaviruses and related nidoviruses stick out from other plus-strand RNA viruses by the large number of virally encoded nonstructural proteins that are either involved in viral RNA synthesis or interact with host cell functions (reviewed in Masters and Perlman, 2013, Ziebuhr, 2008). Most of the nonstructural proteins (nsp) are expressed as subdomains of two large replicase gene-encoded polyproteins called pp1a (\u223c450 kDa) and pp1ab (\u223c750 kDa). Co- and posttranslational cleavage of pp1a/1ab by two types of virus-encoded proteases gives rise to a total of 15\u201316 mature proteins that (together with the nucleocapsid protein and cellular proteins) form the viral replication-transcription complex (RTC) (Almaz\u00e1n et al., 2004, Schelle et al., 2005, Ziebuhr, 2008, Ziebuhr et al., 2000). This multi-protein complex replicates the viral genome and produces an extensive set of 3\u2032-coterminal subgenomic messenger RNAs (sg mRNAs), the latter representing a hallmark of corona- and other nidoviruses (Pasternak et al., 2006, Sawicki et al., 2007, Ziebuhr and Snijder, 2007). The sg mRNAs are used to express open reading frames located in the 3\u2032-proximal third of the genome. They essentially encode the viral structural proteins, such as the nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), spike (S) and envelope (E) proteins, and a varying number of accessory proteins, the latter often involved in functions that counteract antiviral host responses (Masters and Perlman, 2013, Narayanan et al., 2008b). Coronavirus sg mRNAs contain a common 5\u2032 leader sequence (approximately 60\u201395 nt) that is identical to the 5\u2032 end of the genome. The complement of this sequence is attached to the 3\u2032 end of nascent negative strands in a complex process called \u201cdiscontinuous extension of negative strands\u201d (Sawicki and Sawicki, 1995, Sawicki and Sawicki, 1998, Sawicki et al., 2007, Sethna et al., 1991). This process involves attenuation of negative-strand RNA synthesis at transcription-regulating sequences (TRS) located upstream of the individual ORFs in the 3\u2032-proximal genome region (\u201cbody TRSs\u201d, TRS-B). Guided by basepairing interactions between the negative-strand complement of a TRS-B and the TRS located downstream of the 5\u2032 leader on the viral genome (\u201cleader TRS\u201d, TRS-L), the nascent minus strand may be transferred from its downstream position on the template (at the TRS-B) to the TRS-L, where negative-strand RNA synthesis is then resumed and completed by copying the 5\u2032 leader sequence. The set of 3\u2032 antileader-containing sg minus-strand RNAs is subsequently used as templates for the production of the characteristic nested set of 5\u2032 capped, 5\u2032 leader-containing and 3\u2032-polyadenylated sg mRNAs in coronavirus-infected cells (Lai et al., 1983, Sawicki et al., 2001, Sawicki and Sawicki, 1995, Sethna et al., 1989, Spaan et al., 1983). Sg minus-strand RNAs contain a U-stretch at their 5\u2032 end, thus providing a template for 3\u2032 polyadenylation of sg mRNAs (Hofmann and Brian, 1991, Wu et al., 2013).",

These signals are required for viral RNA synthesis (replication and/or transcription) and are collectively referred to as cis-acting RNA elements (Chang et al., 1994, Dalton et al., 2001, Izeta et al., 1999, Kim et al., 1993, Liao and Lai, 1994, Lin et al., 1994, Lin et al., 1996, Zhang et al., 1994). As indicated above, coronaviruses also contain cis-acting elements at internal positions in the genome, the best documented ones being the leader and body TRSs which play a vital role in the transfer of the nascent minus-strand RNA to an upstream position on the template (see above). Other internal cis-acting elements include specific RNA signals required for genome packing, which have been characterized in a small number of coronaviruses (Chen et al., 2007, Escors et al., 2003, Makino et al., 1990, Morales et al., 2013, Penzes et al., 1994), and a complex RNA pseudoknot structure located in the ORF1a-ORF1b overlap region that mediates a (\u22121) ribosomal frameshift event and thus controls the expression of the second large ORF on the coronavirus genome RNA (ORF1b) (Brierley et al., 1987, Brierley et al., 1989, de Haan et al., 2002, Namy et al., 2006).",

            "text": "The coronavirus RTC is a multi-subunit assembly comprised of more than a dozen viral and an unknown number of cellular proteins. The complex is anchored through transmembrane domains present in nsps 3, 4 and 6 to intracellular membranous structures that provide a specialized membrane-shielded compartment in (or at) which viral RNA synthesis takes place (den Boon and Ahlquist, 2010, Gosert et al., 2002, Kanjanahaluethai et al., 2007, Knoops et al., 2008, Oostra et al., 2008, Oostra et al., 2007, Snijder et al., 2006, van Hemert et al., 2008). Over the past years, viral components of the coronavirus RTC have been characterized in considerable detail, providing a wealth of functional and structural information (reviewed in Imbert et al., 2010, Masters, 2006, Ulferts et al., 2010, Ulferts and Ziebuhr, 2011, Ziebuhr, 2008). A large number of virally encoded enzymes, including protease, ADP-ribose-1\u2033-phosphatase, NTPase, 5\u2032-to-3\u2032 helicase, RNA 5\u2032-triphosphatase, RNA polymerase, guanosine-N7 and ribose 2\u2032-O methyltransferases, 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 exoribonuclease and uridylate-specific endoribonuclease, have been identified (Baker et al., 1989, Bhardwaj et al., 2004, Chen et al., 2009, Chen et al., 2011, Decroly et al., 2008, Decroly et al., 2011, Eckerle et al., 2010, Ivanov et al., 2004, Kanjanahaluethai and Baker, 2000, Minskaia et al., 2006, Putics et al., 2005, Saikatendu et al., 2005, Seybert et al., 2000, te Velthuis et al., 2010, Ziebuhr et al., 1995). In some cases, these activities could be linked to specific steps of viral RNA synthesis and/or RNA processing or were shown to interfere with cellular functions (reviewed in Masters and Perlman, 2013, Ziebuhr, 2008). There are multiple interactions between the individual replicase gene-encoded nsps and the structural basis and functional implications of these interactions have been studied in a few cases. For example, it has been shown that the exoribonuclease and ribose 2\u2032 O-methyltransferase activities associated with nsp14 and nsp16, respectively, are each stimulated by specific interactions with nsp10 (Bouvet et al., 2014, Decroly et al., 2011). Also, there is evidence that a heteromultimeric complex formed by nsp7 and nsp8 interacts with (and serves as a processivity factor for) the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, nsp12) (Zhai et al., 2005). Additional interactions between individual subunits of the RTC have been suggested on the basis of two-hybrid screening data (Pan et al., 2008, von Brunn et al., 2007) and there is evidence that a substantial number of coronavirus nsps form homo- and/or heterooligomeric complexes (Anand et al., 2002, Anand et al., 2003, Bouvet et al., 2014, Chen et al., 2011, Ricagno et al., 2006, Su et al., 2006, Xiao et al., 2012, Zhai et al., 2005).",

In subsequent studies on alpha- and gammacoronaviruses, minimal 5\u2032 cis-acting signals of 649 and 544 nt were determined for TGEV (Escors et al., 2003) and IBV, respectively (Dalton et al., 2001). The 5\u2032-terminal genome regions of 466 nt (MHV) to 649 nt (TGEV) comprise the entire 5\u2032 UTR ranging in size from 210 nt (MHV, BCoV and HCoV-OC43) to 314 nt (TGEV) and thus extend into the nsp1-coding region of ORF 1a (see below). By contrast, the gammacoronavirus IBV features a much larger 5\u2032 UTR (528 nt) (Boursnell et al., 1987) and lacks a counterpart of nsp1 (Ziebuhr et al., 2001). It therefore appears that the gammacoronavirus 5\u2032 UTR (alone) contains all the 5\u2032 RNA signals required for genome replication.",

            "text": "Subsequent studies suggested (a varying degree of) conservation of 5\u2032 cis-acting elements among betacoronaviruses and even the more distantly related alpha- and gammacoronaviruses (Chen and Olsthoorn, 2010, Kang et al., 2006). To facilitate the discussion of data obtained in studies of different viruses by different laboratories, we will use in this article a uniform nomenclature for the main RNA structural elements in the 5\u2032-proximal genome region (SL1, SL2, [SL3 if present], SL4 and SL5). The nomenclature is based on SL designations used by the Leibowitz and Giedroc laboratories and in predictions of genus- and lineage-specific conservation patterns of 5\u2032 cis-acting elements in alpha-, beta- and gammacoronaviruses (Chen and Olsthoorn, 2010, Kang et al., 2006, Liu et al., 2006, Liu et al., 2007). The proposed functional and structural conservation of 5\u2032 cis-acting elements among betacoronaviruses received strong support by reverse-genetic data demonstrating that SARS-CoV SL1, SL2, and SL4 can functionally replace their counterparts in the MHV genome when introduced individually (Kang et al., 2006). By contrast, replacement of the entire MHV 5\u2032 UTR with that of SARS-CoV did not produce a viable MHV mutant, suggesting a requirement for additional stable or transient long-range RNA-RNA interactions of the 5\u2032 UTR with other genome regions. Evidence to support this hypothesis was obtained in subsequent studies. For example, the energetically unstable lower part of MHV SL1 was found to be involved in long-range RNA interactions with the 3\u2032 UTR (Li et al., 2008) (see below). Also, in a study using MHV/BCoV chimera, a region downstream of SL4 was revealed to be engaged in long-range interactions with the nsp1-coding region, thus possibly forming an extensive higher-order RNA structure (Guan et al., 2012). A subsequent BCoV DI RNA mutagenesis study (Su et al., 2014) further suggested that this multipartite RNA structure may involve several stem-loop (sub)structures identified in earlier studies (Gustin et al., 2009, Raman and Brian, 2005) but require refolding of other RNA structures suggested earlier to be essential for DI RNA replication (Brown et al., 2007). The study by Su et al. (2014) also identified an intriguing requirement in cis of an oligopeptide sequence in the N-proximal part of nsp1, suggesting that nsp1 may be an essential cis-acting protein factor in betacoronavirus replication, in addition to its multiple other functions (Brockway and Denison, 2005, Huang et al., 2011a, Huang et al., 2011b, Kamitani et al., 2006, Kamitani et al., 2009, Lei et al., 2013, Lokugamage et al., 2012, Narayanan et al., 2008a, Tanaka et al., 2012, Tohya et al., 2009, Wathelet et al., 2007, Z\u00fcst et al., 2007). Possible interacting partners for nsp1 remain to be identified.",

In the vast majority of coronaviruses, SL4 contains a short ORF comprised of only a few codons. Because of its position in the genome upstream of ORF1a it is generally referred to as the uORF. Recent reverse genetics work in the MHV system (Wu et al., 2014, Yang et al., 2011) showed that disruption of the uORF yields viable mutants that, however, acquire alternate uORFs upon serial passaging in cell culture. In vitro, uORF-disrupted RNAs showed enhanced translation of the downstream ORF. The available data suggest that the uORF represses ORF1a/1b translation and has a beneficial but non-essential role in coronavirus replication in cell culture. SL4 may be further subdivided into SL4a and SL4b. Interestingly, despite its conservation in coronaviruses, SL4 tolerates extensive mutations. Thus, for MHV, it was shown that base pairing in SL4a is not required for replication and separate deletions of SL4a and SL4b are tolerated. By contrast, complete deletion of SL4 and a 3-nt deletion immediately downstream of SL4 abolished or profoundly impaired viral RNA synthesis. The characterization of second-site mutations and a viable MHV mutant in which SL4 was replaced with a shorter sequence-unrelated stem-loop led to a model in which SL4 was proposed to function as a spacer element that controls the orientation of SL1, SL2, and TRS-L and thereby directs subgenomic RNA synthesis (Yang et al., 2011). The SL4 sequence overlaps with the \u2018hotspot\u2019 of the 5\u2032-proximal genomic acceptor required for BCoV discontinuous transcription (Wu et al., 2006), thus further supporting a role of the region immediately downstream of TRS-L in subgenomic RNA synthesis.",

In alpha- and betacoronaviruses, SL5 extends into ORF1a. Depending on the lineage studied, conserved loop sequences could be identified in substructural hairpins of SL5. Sequence conservation was found to be more pronounced in alpha- compared to betacoronaviruses. Thus, for example, in alphacoronaviruses, three hairpins, called SL5a, 5b, and 5c, each containing a 5\u2032-UUCCGU-3\u2032 loop sequence, were identified. Similar structures were only partly conserved in betacoronaviruses and significant lineage-specific variations in the substructural hairpins and their loop sequences were identified. A possible SL5 equivalent in gammacoronaviruses was predicted to adopt a rod-like structure that lacks conserved loop sequences (Chen and Olsthoorn, 2010). As outlined above, possible betacoronavirus SL5 substructures located within (or extending into) the nsp1-coding region (termed SLs IV, V, VI, and VII) have been characterized structurally and functionally using BCoV DI RNA and MHV reverse genetics systems (Brown et al., 2007, Guan et al., 2011, Guan et al., 2012, Raman and Brian, 2005).",

We therefore decided to embark on a more detailed characterization of putative alphacoronavirus cis-acting elements located in the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 genome regions. As a starting point, we used 20 coronavirus genomes representing all the currently approved species from the four genera of the Coronavirinae and the newly identified MERS-CoV (de Groot et al., 2013) and calculated alignment-based secondary structures using LocARNA (v.1.7.2) (Will et al., 2012). Although LocARNA considers both sequence and secondary structure to calculate these multiple alignments, we failed to detect RNA secondary structures conserved across all coronavirus genera when using these highly diverse sequences. We therefore resorted to producing separate genus-wide alignment-based secondary structure predictions for coronaviruses. To do this, we used complete 5\u2032 UTR regions and 20 nts from the ORF1a 5\u2032 end to calculate consensus structures with RNAalifold -r -p --color --noLP --MEA (v.2.0.7) (Lorenz et al., 2011) and -C, respectively, if constraints were used. The subgroups (lineages) obtained in these sequence alignments were consistent with the previously recognized subgroups of alpha- and betacoronaviruses (de Groot et al., 2012a, de Groot et al., 2013) (not shown). As shown in Fig. 1\n, all the functionally relevant RNA secondary structure elements identified previously in the betacoronavirus 5\u2032 genome regions, SL1, SL2 and SL4, could be identified. In line with previous predictions and despite the pronounced sequence diversity in the 5\u2032-terminal genome regions, these RNA structures are suggested to be conserved among all currently approved betacoronavirus lineages and species. This conclusion is also supported by the large number of covariations, suggesting a strong selection pressure to retain these base-pairing interactions. Fig. 1 also shows the lack of conservation of a stable hairpin structure containing the TRS-L. It should be noted that, for several betacoronaviruses, it is possible to force a stem-loop containing the TRS-L, but this stem-loop is only supported by two conserved base pairs. In line with previous reports, bovine coronavirus (and other viruses belonging to the species Betacoronavirus 1) appear(s) to be an exception in that a more stable SL3 containing the 5\u2032-UCUAAAC-3\u2032 sequence in the loop region can be predicted in this case. Overall, the structure prediction shown in Fig. 1 turned out to be in perfect agreement with previous studies (see chapter 2.2).",

These include (i) SL1, (ii) SL2 (with its short stem and highly conserved loop region [5\u2032-UUUGU-3\u2032 in alphacoronaviruses]), (iii) a poorly structured region containing the TRS-L CS and some flanking sequence, (iv) SL4 (containing the uORF) and (v) SL5, the latter being conserved very well among all alphacoronavirus species (Fig. 2) and significantly more diverse in betacoronaviruses (Chen and Olsthoorn, 2010). The large number of covariant base pairs in the alphacoronavirus SL5 (Fig. 2) suggest significant constraints and a major functional role for this structure in alphacoronavirus (and, possibly, betacoronavirus) replication and there is indeed some experimental evidence to support this hypothesis (Brown et al., 2007, Su et al., 2014). Using RNA structure probing information obtained for the 5\u2032-terminal 600 nts of HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63, we confirmed and refined our RNA secondary structure predictions for two B-lineage alphacoronaviruses (Fig. 3, Fig. 4\n). The data obtained in these studies (details to be published elsewhere) support a model in which the \u223c310-nt 5\u2032 genome regions consistently fold into 4 major RNA structures called SL1, SL2, SL4, and SL5.

Most importantly, the basal part of the predicted SL4 was now predicted to be unpaired, thereby extending the single-stranded region downstream of the TRS-L and also affecting the spacing between SL4 and SL5. The (predicted) basal stem of SL4 contains the most conserved sequence within the alphacoronavirus 5\u2032-terminal RNA structural elements (Fig. 2, see the red base pairs). It is therefore reasonable to think that this structurally flexible region is involved in long-range RNA-RNA interactions. In line with this idea, a previous TGEV reverse genetic study showed that mutants permitting additional base-pairing interactions of the copy TRS-B upstream of a reporter sgRNA with the 5\u2032-GAAA-3\u2032 sequence immediately downstream of the TGEV TRS-L CS (5\u2032-ACUAAAC-3\u2032) (see also Fig. 2) enhance the production of this specific reporter sgRNA (Z\u00fa\u00f1iga et al., 2004). These functional data and our structural analyses of alphacoronavirus 5\u2032-terminal genome regions lead us to suggest that the basal part of SL4 exists in a flexible state, thereby possibly facilitating strand transfer during sg minus-strand RNA synthesis. Both this RNA structural flexibility and the role of proteins that bind in this region and thereby likely affect the SL4 structure remain to be further investigated. Of note, hnRNP family members along with the viral N protein have been shown to bind in this region and the N protein has been suggested to have chaperone and TRS-L/TRS-B unwinding activities (Gal\u00e1n et al., 2009, Grossoehme et al., 2009, Huang and Lai, 1999, Keane et al., 2012, Li et al., 1997, Li et al., 1999, Shi and Lai, 2005, Sola et al., 2011a, Sola et al., 2011b, Z\u00fa\u00f1iga et al., 2007, Z\u00fa\u00f1iga et al., 2010). It is therefore tempting to speculate that cellular and/or viral proteins bind and unwind the energetically labile SL4 substructure to facilitate the strand transfer during sg minus-strand RNA synthesis.",

Deletion mutagenesis data suggested that 3\u2032 cis-acting elements encompass the entire 301-nt 3\u2032 UTR plus poly(A) tail, along with a portion of the nucleocapsid (N) protein gene. However, subsequent studies showed that the structural protein genes (including the N protein coding region) tolerate major changes including combinations of single-site mutations and rearrangements of entire genes, suggesting that the 3\u2032-proximal coding regions do not form part of the 3\u2032 cis-acting element (de Haan et al., 2002, Goebel et al., 2004b, Lorenz et al., 2011). Similarly, for members of the species Alphacoronavirus 1 (TGEV, FCoV), it was shown that the N gene was not required for replication (Izeta et al., 1999) and even deletions of the accessory protein genes 7a and 7b were tolerated in FCoV, suggesting that the 3\u2032 cis-acting replication signals do not exceed 283 nts plus poly(A) tail (Haijema et al., 2004). For the gammacoronavirus IBV, a minimal 3\u2032-terminal sequence of 338 nts was reported to be required for DI RNA replication (Dalton et al., 2001), supporting the idea that, across all coronavirus genera, the 3\u2032 UTR contains all the cis-acting elements required for replication. For MHV, it was shown that a significantly smaller fragment of no more than 55 nts suffices for the initiation of negative-strand RNA synthesis (Lin et al., 1994), suggesting differential requirements for plus- versus minus-strand RNA synthesis. Furthermore, using betacoronavirus DI RNA systems, a short poly(A) tract of at least 5\u201310 nts was found to be required for replication (Spagnolo and Hogue, 2000).",

The first essential RNA structural element, called bulged stem-loop (BSL), was discovered in MHV (Hsue and Masters, 1997). It comprises 68 nts immediately downstream of the MHV N gene stop codon and was discovered as a result of attempts to replace the MHV 3\u2032 UTR with that of BCoV (Hsue and Masters, 1997). Despite limited sequence identity in the 3\u2032 UTRs of the two viruses, replacements of the entire 3\u2032 UTR (and specific parts of it) were tolerated, suggesting the presence of conserved structures (rather than sequences) that perform cis-acting functions in betacoronavirus replication (Hsue and Masters, 1997). The conservation of functionally equivalent elements in the 3\u2032 (and 5\u2032) UTR(s) among betacoronavirus genomes was further supported by a study showing that a BCoV-derived reporter DI RNA was efficiently replicated by a range of BCoV- and MHV-related betacoronaviruses (Wu et al., 2003). Interestingly, a possible BSL equivalent was also identified in IBV and other gammacoronaviruses and its functional significance was demonstrated using IBV DI RNA constructs (Dalton et al., 2001). The nearly perfect stem-loop structure in IBV comprises 42 nts and is located at the upstream end of region II, a conserved region in the gammacoronavirus 3\u2032 UTR.",

            "text": "The second essential RNA element within the (betacoronavirus) 3\u2032 UTR is a classical hairpin-type RNA pseudoknot (PK) structure that was first discovered in BCoV and shown to be required for DI RNA replication (Williams et al., 1999). In BCoV, the PK comprises 54 nts and is located immediately downstream of the BSL. Equivalent PK structures were predicted to be conserved in beta- and alphacoronaviruses while gammacoronaviruses were proposed to retain only a few features of this PK or to lack this structure altogether (Williams et al., 1999). In a subsequent study using a reverse genetics approach, the functional significance of the PK in genome replication was demonstrated for MHV (Goebel et al., 2004a). Also the more distantly related betacoronaviruses HCoV-HKU1 (Woo et al., 2005) and SARS-CoV were confirmed to contain this PK structure (Goebel et al., 2004b). The 3\u2032 UTR regions of MHV and SARS-CoV, which only share 38% sequence identity, were shown to be interchangeable, again supporting the conservation of functionally equivalent structures among different betacoronavirus lineages. Apparently, this conservation does not extend to alpha- and gammacoronaviruses because replacements of the MHV 3\u2032 UTR with that of TGEV and IBV, respectively, did not give rise to viable MHV mutants (Goebel et al., 2004b). Together, these data suggest that coronaviruses evolved several genus-specific cis-acting RNA elements. For example, the presence of a BSL followed by a PK structure is limited to betacoronaviruses, while other genera appear to contain only one of these elements, with the PK being conserved in alphacoronaviruses and the BSL in gammacoronaviruses (Dalton et al., 2001, Hsue and Masters, 1997, Williams et al., 1999) (see Section 2.6).",

In the primary structure, the BSL and PK regions overlap by several nucleotides. Formation of the first stem of the PK structure requires base-pairing interactions with the downstream segment F of the BSL, thereby destabilizing the latter structure. In an extensive MHV mutagenesis study, the functional significance of both structures was demonstrated conclusively. Because the two structures cannot exist simultaneously and, yet, each of them is essential for viral replication, it was proposed that the two elements may adopt alternate structures that act as a \u2018molecular switch\u2019 controlling the transition between different steps of the viral replication cycle (Goebel et al., 2004a). Initial mechanistic insight into how this \u2018molecular switch\u2019 might work was obtained in a subsequent study that provided evidence for a direct interaction between loop 1 of the PK with the extreme 3\u2032 end of the MHV genome (Z\u00fcst et al., 2008). The characterization of second-site revertants arising from MHV mutants with genetically engineered oligonucleotide insertions in loop 1 revealed distinct replacements at the extreme 3\u2032 end, thereby retaining specific base-pairing interactions with the loop 1 region and thus precluding the formation of stem 1 of the PK. Another set of mutants contained second-site mutations that suggested specific interactions of the PK region with nsp8 and nsp9. Based on this study, a model was proposed in which the formation and disruption of the PK by differential base-pairing interactions with the BSL and 3\u2032-terminal genome sequences, respectively, may lead to alternate structures that govern different steps of the initiation and continuation of negative-strand RNA synthesis (Z\u00fcst et al., 2008). Further evidence to support this model was obtained in a subsequent MHV reverse genetics study by Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2013). Thermodynamic investigations revealed a limited stability of the PK structure (Stammler et al., 2011), further supporting the structural flexibility of this cis-acting element and, thus, its proposed role as a \u2018molecular switch\u2019.",

This strict conservation suggests an important functional role for the octanucleotide sequence. To date, however, the function of the sequence has not been identified. As mentioned above, the entire HVR including the octanucleotide sequence can be deleted from the MHV genome without causing major defects in viral replication in vitro (Goebel et al., 2007). In line with this, replacements of single nucleotides within the octanucleotide motif were tolerated although, in most cases, the octanucleotide mutants exhibited small-plaque phenotypes and/or delayed single-step growth kinetics. In both high- and low-multiplicity-of-infection experiments, octanucleotide and HVR deletion mutants lagged behind the wild-type virus but reached near-wildtype titers at later time points and had no detectable defect in gRNA or sgRNA synthesis (Goebel et al., 2007).",

This requirement corresponds well to the minimal binding site of the poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) on DI RNAs poly(A) sequences (Spagnolo and Hogue, 2000).

Because of the length of these sequences (300 nts), many local secondary structures with similar free energies and base pair probabilities were identified and, thus, it proved to be difficult to make reliable predictions on stable RNA secondary structures in this region. As described above for the 5\u2032 UTR, we therefore decided to use a combination of sequence and structural alignments of all currently recognized alphacoronavirus species to identify conserved RNA structures. The predictions were then further refined using structure probing data obtained for HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63.",

As shown in Fig. 5\n, we were able to detect conserved RNA structural elements in the betacoronavirus 3\u2032 UTR, including the BSL and the two SL structures that form the PK immediately downstream of the BSL. Consistent with previous studies (Goebel et al., 2004a), our predictions suggest that the formation of the PK requires structural rearrangements at the base of the BSL to permit the base-pairing interactions required to form PK stem 1, the latter involving the PK-SL2 loop sequence and the BSL 3\u2032-terminal sequence (Fig. 5A and B). Interestingly, our analyses also revealed another conserved structural element, a short hairpin, immediately upstream of the PK-SL2. Formation of this hairpin would compete with base-pairing interactions required to form the basal part of the BSL and the PK stem 1, respectively (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, the hairpin overlaps partly with the PK loop 1 region that, in a previous study, was suggested to interact with the extreme 3\u2032 end of the genome (Z\u00fcst et al., 2008). The conservation of both structure and sequence of this hairpin suggest a biological function for this element. In this context, it may be worth mentioning that the hairpin structure is predicted to be disrupted by the 6-nt insertion in loop 1 that was reported previously to cause a poorly replicating and unstable phenotype in MHV (Goebel et al., 2004a). It remains to be seen if the small hairpin represents yet another element in the intricate network of base-pairing interactions between the BSL, the PK, and the 3\u2032 end that together constitute the complex molecular switch proposed by the Masters laboratory (Goebel et al., 2004a). Consistent with previous studies, we identified only one conserved RNA structural element in the HVR downstream of PK-SL2. This stem-loop contained the conserved octanucleotide sequence in a single-stranded region. As pointed out above, the role of this element is currently unclear as both the HVR and octanucleotide sequence proved to dispensable for betacoronavirus (MHV) replication in vitro (Goebel et al., 2007, Liu et al., 2001). Overall, the alignment-based structure prediction algorithms used in our analysis led to conclusions that were consistent with results obtained in previous studies on betacoronavirus 3\u2032 UTRs, suggesting that the approach might also be suitable to make reliable predictions on conserved RNA structural elements in the highly variable alphacoronavirus 3\u2032 UTRs.",

Interestingly, despite the absence of an upstream BSL in alphacoronaviruses, the formation of this putative PK structure is predicted to require the disruption of a short hairpin immediately upstream of PK-SL2, a scenario that is similar but less complex compared to the situation described above for betacoronaviruses. It remains to be investigated in further studies whether or not alphacoronaviruses employ a molecular switch mechanism similar to what has been described for betacoronaviruses (Goebel et al., 2004a).",

By contrast, no such interactions were seen in HCoV-229E. Also, the structure probing data did not support the formation of a stable PK structure, possibly reflecting a similarly low thermodynamic stability as determined for the equivalent PK in betacoronaviruses (Stammler et al., 2011).

The structure is supported by a large number of covariant base pairs and contains the conserved octanucleotide sequence in a single-stranded region. The large distal part of the stem-loop structure was further corroborated by structure probing data (Fig. 7, details to be published elsewhere). In both HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63, the octanucleotide sequence was found to be located in the loop region. Of note, the cell culture-adapted HCoV-NL63 isolate used for our structure probing analysis contained a short deletion apparently acquired upon serial passaging in cell culture, resulting in a significantly smaller loop but retaining the octanucleotide sequence (with one G-to-A replacement) in an identical position in the loop when compared to HCoV-229E (see Fig. 7A and B). This serendipitous deletion shows that the distal part of the extended stem-loop structure is not essential for HCoV-NL63 replication in cell culture. The data also indicate that, despite the deletion, the octanucleotide sequence retains a position in a loop region of the stem-loop structure and tolerates minimal changes, the latter being consistent with MHV reverse genetics data obtained for the HVR/octanucleotide region (Goebel et al., 2007).",

            "text": "Using a combination of bioinformatic and biochemical methods, the present study confirms and extends this previous work. Our study suggests that RNA secondary structure elements may be more conserved than previously thought, both within individual coronavirus genera and across different genera as shown here for the genera Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus. Although significantly more work is needed to further characterize the structures identified in this and previous studies and understand their functional role, the available data suggest a cross-genus conservation of a number of RNA structural elements among alpha- and betacoronaviruses. The conservation pattern is consistent with the replicase gene-based classification of genera within the subfamily Coronavirinae (de Groot et al., 2012a). Conserved elements include stem-loops 1, 2, 4, and, possibly, 5 in the 5\u2032-terminal genome region and a putative PK in the 3\u2032 UTR. The data further suggest that, in both alpha- and betacoronaviruses, the formation of the PK may require structural rearrangements in other regions (upstream of the SL2) and it remains an attractive idea to suggest specific functions for these alternative structures whose mechanistic and functional details remain to be investigated (Goebel et al., 2004a, Z\u00fcst et al., 2008). Finally, in line with previous observations (Brian and Baric, 2005, Masters, 2007, Sola et al., 2011b), the study confirms a significant degree of variation in the 3\u2032-terminal region of the 3\u2032 UTR, with the conserved octanucleotide sequence being consistently located in a single-stranded region of a stem-loop structure. Interestingly, specific lineages of beta-, gamma- and deltacoronaviruses (as well as other plus-strand RNA viruses) may contain another structural element, called s2m, in the 3\u2032 UTR, thus further adding to the variability of this genome region in coronaviruses (Jonassen et al., 1998, Robertson et al., 2005, Tengs et al., 2013). The conservation pattern of the various lineage-specific structural elements argues against a conserved function in viral RNA synthesis but rather suggests that the 3\u2032 UTR may contain elements that are involved in specific virus-host interactions and/or pathogenesis as has been shown for the MHV HVR (Goebel et al., 2007).",
