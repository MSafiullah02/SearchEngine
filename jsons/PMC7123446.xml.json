Steroids have not been shown to be effective. There may be a role for intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or plasma exchange in severe dengue infections. Hypoglycemia and hyponatremia should be avoided and rapidly corrected if present. A platelet count of less than 20,000, or less than 40,000, with associated bleeding warrants platelet transfusion. Ventilation should be supported as needed by noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation.

There is hyponatremia and low serum osmolarity without signs of hypovolemia. Hyponatremia can cause convulsions. Cerebral salt wasting is a much rarer condition that gives hyponatremia with signs of volume contraction. SIADH is treated by free water restriction and cerebral salt wasting is treated with sodium (either IV or PO) supplementation. In a hyponatremic child with convulsions give 3% NaCl 3\u20135 ml/kg intravenously. It is important to note that the change of serum sodium (and hence serum osmolarity) is of more importance in some cases than the absolute serum sodium. A sudden drop in serum sodium (greater than 0.5\u20131.0 micromole/h) should be treated with hypertonic saline.Seizures: Convulsions that occur early in the course of purulent meningitis are usually generalized and have less prognostic significance than those occurring later. Etiology of convulsions in meningitis can be any of the following: brain edema, diffuse ischemia, hyponatremia, subdural collection, sinus venous thrombosis, or focal infarction.Subdural effusion: This complication is seen more commonly in neonates and infants. A good practice is to measure the head circumference daily in any infant with meningitis. The diagnosis is made or confirmed by neuroimaging. If the effusion is large, or if it is associated with focal signs, convulsions, or signs of increased intracranial pressure, a neurosurgical consultation is necessary.Obstructive hydrocephalus: Obstructive hydrocephalus occurs when the pus (often with high protein content) in the ventricles blocks the outflow of CSF.

The main differences are:Patients after solid organ transplants are usually less immunosuppressed than HSCT patients and are not at risk of immune reconstitution syndrome and its associated inflammatory and infectious complications. However they are at risk of surgery-related complications and postsurgical infection issues (wound infection, bacteremia, atelectasis/pneumonia, urinary tract infection).Infection of the transplanted organ due to latent or colonizing organisms present in either the donor or recipient can lead to invasive widespread disease in the immune suppressed post-transplant recipient. An example of this is the child with cystic fibrosis colonized with Pseudomonas species; those colonized with B. cepacia are particularly at risk of developing resistant infection post lung or combined heart/lung transplants.Children receiving solid organ transplants are at risk of reactivation of latent infections, such as CMV. But, unlike HSCT patients who most commonly present with CMV pneumonitis in recipients of solid organ transplants the CMV disease depends on the sites where the virus is latent and on the organ that has been transplanted. Lung, heart/lung, and liver transplant patients are most vulnerable to systemic disease. CMV infection can precipitate rejection and increase vulnerability to other infections such as fungal infections.EBV-associated post transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is a potentially fatal complication of solid organ transplant. The risk of PTLD is higher in children who were EBV seronegative prior to the SOT. EBV-related infection in SOT patients may present in several different ways: asymptomatic or nonspecific viral syndrome, mononucleosis syndrome, and PTLD. The latter can have a spectrum from fever, lymphadenopathy and diarrhea to full blown lymphoma. Tissue biopsy is necessary to establish the diagnosis of PTLD. The mainstay of therapy consists of decreasing immunosuppression. Chemotherapy and biological treatments (such as anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies) have been used.\n",
