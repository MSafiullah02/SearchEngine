On the first day of use, three providers caring for smaller patients (weight range, 4 to 12 kg) undergoing either laparoscopic or nonlaparoscopic surgery encountered severe hypercapnea, with peak end-tidal carbon dioxide levels from 70 to 124 mmHg. Patients\u2019 tidal volumes ranged from 36 to 150 ml. The hypercapnea could not be managed by alteration of the ventilation parameters (rate, pressure, fresh gas flow). Practitioners finally removed the filter, and renormalization of end-tidal carbon dioxide occurred within the next 5 min. The problem was diagnosed as excessive dead space, relative to tidal volume, caused by the imposition of the viral filter. After clinician feedback and review of these instances, clinicians were provided with more detailed communication regarding the intent of the filters and their physical properties for dead space volume (35 ml), and clinicians were specifically informed that they were permitted to place the filter on the expiratory limb if needed to reduce dead space ventilation.",

A second noted problem was that this intervention of viral filters was \u201csticky\u201d in the minds of providers. Providers were reluctant to remove the filter even once they knew this was the cause of their ventilation issues. Caught up in the race to \u201cdo something\u201d under current pandemic circumstances, clinicians may feel hesitant to reverse an even obviously harmful intervention (the addition of large dead space to small patients), because of concerns for the unknown consequences of a decision to remove the filter.",
