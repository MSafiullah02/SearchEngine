The WHO statement stated that this was the first pandemic sparked by a coronavirus. With the global rise in infection and mortality, front line medical staff in many countries are being pushed to the limits in managing infected patients. The pandemic has also affected pediatric surgery and the approach to patients with minimal access surgery; as anesthetists, intensive care specialists and nurses have been channeled to manage critical patients with SARS-CoV-2, depleting their numbers for pediatric surgical procedures.",

An operating theater with separate access should be designated for all confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases. The ideal situation would be to have the operating theater consisting of five interconnected rooms, of which only the waiting and anesthesia induction rooms have negative atmospheric pressures, whereas the operating theater, preparation, and scrub rooms have positive pressures. Understanding the airflow within the operating theater is crucial to minimizing the risk of infection. It is also important that the same operating theater and the same anesthesia machine solely be used for the COVID-19 cases for the entire duration of the pandemic. Besides optimal theater setup, proper PPE for the teams involved in such procedures and strict following of hospital infectious disease protocols is mandatory.",

It strongly recommended, that consideration be given to the possibility of viral contamination to staff during surgery either open, laparoscopic or robotic and that protective measures are strictly employed for operating room staff safety and to maintain a functioning workforce. It further added that there may be enhanced  risk of viral exposure to the teams performing endoscopic and airway procedures.  The practical measures recommended specifically for endoscopic surgery were: (a) Incisions for ports should be as small as possible to allow for the passage of ports but not allow for leakage around ports, (b) CO2 insufflation pressure should be kept to a minimum and an ultra-filtration should be used, if available and (c) all pneumoperitoneum should be safely evacuated via a filtration system before closure, port removal, specimen extraction or conversion to open. When these procedures are necessary, enhanced PPE should be considered as aerosol and fomite transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is plausible, as the virus can remain viable and infectious in aerosols for hours and on surfaces up to days [5].",

This level of risk has not been clearly defined and it is likely that the level of PPE deployed may be important. The guidance warrants consideration of laparoscopy only in selected individual cases where clinical benefit to the patient substantially exceeds the risk of potential viral transmission. The guidance recommends to look into appropriate non-operative treatment or open alternatives. For emergency procedures, it also recommends to treat all patients as COVID-19 positive and to add a computed tomography of thorax done in the past 24 hours in the preoperative assessment.",

Although studies have shown that there were no clinical findings or investigations suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 in neonates born to affected mothers [9], a recent publication has suggested that the vertical maternal\u2013fetal transmission cannot be ruled out [10]. Reports are now emerging over fecal\u2013oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2, pointing to the fact that asymptomatic children and adults may be shedding infectious virus that could be transmitted [11]. Further evidence shows that children have persistently tested positive on rectal swabs even after nasopharyngeal testing was negative [12]. In order to maintain safety of operation room personnel, all these transmission sources and factors should be borne in mind when performing procedures in neonates, asymptomatic children or children with negative nasal swabs,",
