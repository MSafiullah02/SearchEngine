By February 18, 2020, with the increased number of confirmed cases in Daegu, many EDs were consecutively and repeatedly closed, and medical staff on duty and inpatients were quarantined. However, sudden ED closure goes against the laws that regulate the provision of emergency medical care, which enables the public to receive prompt, appropriate, and 24-hour emergency medical attention5; ED closures need to be carefully determined as they can seriously affect the treatment of severely ill patients, such as those with acute myocardial infarction, acute stroke, and major trauma.",

Data on triage systems from before and after the COVID-19 outbreak, nosocomial transmission that resulted in temporary ED closures, and the level of PPE use among healthcare professionals in the ED were investigated through EPs who worked in these EDs. Fever was defined as an axillary temperature of 37.5\u00b0C or higher. Exposure to a source of transmission was defined as travel within 14 days to a country which was reported to possess a COVID-19 risk by the KCDC, contact with a COVID-19 patient or a member of the Shincheonji sect.",

In Korea, rarely the KCDC has ordered the shutdown of hospitals on confirmation of a positive case of an emerging infectious disease in the hospital or the community. Hospital closure and isolation appears to have played a useful role in preventing an emerging infectious disease, both in-hospital and amongst the local community.78 However, temporary ED closure is being variably implemented by each hospital, depending on the situation, in the absence of clear guidelines from the KCDC or local governmental authorities. ED closure has many effects, such as disruption of emergency care provision to other severely ill emergency patients. However, ED closures have not been sufficiently deliberated, and further discussions and clearer standard guidelines are needed.",

The severity is graded on the basis of chief complaints or vital signs. In the present study, it is shown that the original ED triage protocol was ineffective in the identification and isolation of COVID-19 patients with nonspecific symptoms.",

The KTAS level 1 and 2 life-threatening patients or emergency cases were treated as previously; but emergency workers were required to use appropriate PPE and use negative pressure carts to move all patients. For KTAS levels 2, 3, and 4, modified methods were used. In the revised triage, if the chest imaging showed abnormal findings or the patient had respiratory symptoms or risk factors, he/she was moved to a negative-pressure isolation room (NPIR). In cases with even mild suspicion of fever of unknown origin or COVID-19, it was recommended to move the patient to a temporary isolation area in the ER with readjusted bed gap and curtain (or wall) separation (ER cohort isolation). When the room was full, the patient's car was used as an isolation area and medical treatment was initiated for the patient in the vehicle until the NPIR was empty. Patients without any possibility of having COVID-19 infection entered the observation zone (Figs. 2 and 3). In the case of mildly ill patients, KTAS levels 4 or 5, it was necessary to guide them to local clinics to reduce patient load in the ED and reduce the number of ED beds and to increase the physical distance between sick beds. Furthermore, the authors of this report conducted cardiopulmonary resuscitation of patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrests outside the ED (Fig. 2). In 2015, massive hospital transmissions had occurred because of a MERS super spreader in the ER.123 Since then, the Korean ED environment has been improved, such as through the installation of a ventilation system, expansion of the ER space, and bigger bed gaps, and through educating guardians to use appropriate PPE, such as masks. Due to these changes, it is assumed that no hospital transmission in the ED occurred this time.",

This confers minimal legal protection that permits doctors to exercise conscientious discretion when treating patients, but the same needs to be expanded and applied in the management of emerging infectious diseases. In the event of a second transmission, the current method wherein the doctor or hospital takes full responsibility and faces blame can lead to the refusal of medical services to certain patients. In fact, a private clinic did not even undertake examinations in cases of MERS and COVID-19, which led to an influx of patients at the tertiary hospital. Even if an unavoidable secondary transmission occurs, it is necessary to establish a provision that confers legal immunity to emergency medical personnel.",
