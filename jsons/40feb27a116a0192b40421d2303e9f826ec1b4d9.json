More than two hundred countries around the world have already been affected by this severe virus as it spreads by human interaction. Moreover, the symptoms of novel coronavirus are quite similar to the general flu. Screening of infected patients is considered as a critical step in the fight against COVID-19. Therefore, it is highly relevant to recognize positive cases as early as possible to avoid further spreading of this epidemic. However, there are several methods to detect COVID-19 positive patients, which are typically performed based on respiratory samples and among them one of the critical approach which is treated as radiology imaging or X-Ray imaging. Recent findings from X-Ray imaging techniques suggest that such images contain relevant information about the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In this article, we have introduced a Deep Neural Network (DNN) based Faster Regions with Convolutional Neural Networks (Faster R-CNN) framework to detect COVID-19 patients from chest X-Ray images using available open-source dataset. Our proposed approach provides a classification accuracy of 97.36%, 97.65% of sensitivity, and a precision of 99.28%. Therefore, we believe this proposed method might be of assistance for health professionals to validate their initial assessment towards COVID-19 patients.",

A molecular diagnosis method of novel coronavirus was proposed 22 In terms of COVID-19 patients detection using X-Ray images, the Deep model of Ioannis et al. 27 reached a success rate of 98.75% for two classes and 93.48% for three classes. By comprising multiple CNN models, Hemdan et al. 28 have proposed a COVIDX-Net model that is capable of detecting confirmed cases of COVID-19.

This automated system can perform binary classification without manual feature extraction with an accuracy of 97.36%. Moreover, this model is also capable of testing with a larger dataset and work with real-time systems. Furthermore, it can be helpful in areas where the test kit is not sufficient. Therefore, for the initial assessment of COVID-19 patients, this tool can act as a fruitful medium of diagnosis under the supervision of radiologists and doctors. At this point, we are working to make our model more vigorous so that it can detect both CT and X-Ray images.",

In recent times, many radiological images have been extensively used to detect COVID-19 confirmed cases. Sethy et al. 24 classified the properties obtained from different models of CNN with the SVM Classifier using X-Ray images. Besides, Wang et al. 25 suggested a Deep model for COVID19 patients recognition and achieved an accuracy of 92.4% in the classification of standard classes, non-COVID, and COVID-19 Pneumonia.

Besides, more modified versions of CNN are available for model development, such as R-CNN, Fast R-CNN, and Faster R-CNN. In this exploration, we have used Faster Regional based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN). Figure 1(B) is showing the architecture of Faster R-CNN. Furthermore, we used the VGG16 network as the foundation for model classification. We combine this with Faster R-CNN to use this model in a real-time system. Finally, a deep model with a large number of layers is essential for the extraction of properties of an image in a real-time detection system. For that reason, the model classification structure is capable of grasping and learning small differences. An illustration of the proposed model used in this study is shown in Figure 2.
