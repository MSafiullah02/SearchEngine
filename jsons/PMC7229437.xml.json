The trial lasted 6 months. Its main end-point, reduction of aortic calcifications, was not met. However, the patients receiving sodium thiosulphate displayed a significant reduction in their iliac artery calcifications, according to a validated score, while calcifications increased, in the meantime, in the patients on placebo. The favourable effect was not limited to the iliac arteries, since in treated patients arterial stiffness and carotid intima\u2013media thickness tended to decrease and there was no increase in cardiac valvular calcifications. The latter parameters displayed a significant difference between treated and untreated patients. The data, as the authors state, are widely scattered, and statistical significance is \u201cjust met\u201d, if statisticians allow a layman\u2019s definition, for the main result of decrease in iliac calcifications (\u2212 137 \u00b1 641 versus 245 \u00b1 755; P = 0.049). It is therefore quite far from being a perfect trial. However, it is an important study, not because of its superb design, or its outstanding statistics, but because it introduces an important idea, and for the hope it brings.",

In our in-hospital dialysis ward in central France, where the median age is approximately seventy-four, and a high percentage of patients suffer from diabetes and/or obesity (median Charlson Index of 9), over 15% of the patients have experienced a minor or major distal amputation. In the last 4 years, ten patients experienced one episode of calciphylaxis and were treated with sodium thiosulphate.

Sodium thiosulphate is not expensive, at least in Europe; it is readily available, provided that the pharmacy cooperates in its preparation, and can be safely handled, provided that attention is paid to the management of the dialysis session. In patients with calciphylaxis, in our center we perfuse a standard dose of 25 g in the last thirty minutes of dialysis, modulating sodium and bicarbonate concentration in the dialysate.
