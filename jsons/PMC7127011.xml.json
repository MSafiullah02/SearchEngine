            "text": "Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is one of the most common acute lung diseases detected by radiographic abnormalities. In the management of CAP, pneumonias have been categorized into two groups based on sensitivity to antibiotics: bacterial pneumonia, which responds to the beta-lactam antibiotics, and non-bacterial pneumonia, which is non-responsive. Although new macrolides and new quinolones are considered to be effective therapeutic agents for non-bacterial pneumonias as well as for most of bacterial pneumonias, the recent emergence and spread of bacteria resistant to these drugs, especially in Asia including Japan, have raised significant worldwide concern [1], [2]. Therefore, the differentiation of these two types of pneumonias is recommended in the guidelines for the management of CAP from the Japanese Respiratory Society [3]. However, even the combined study of clinical manifestations and laboratory screenings such as blood cell counts and serum chemistries have yielded no information specific to either type of pneumonia. Moreover, studies on chest radiography have also failed to elucidate any precise differences [4].",

Thin-section CT improves the characterization of parenchymal infections and their complications in the management of lung infections [6]. In recent years, investigators have focused on radiologic findings of pneumonia caused by specific pathogens such as mycoplasma and chlamydia and the characteristics of these pneumonias have been described [5], [7], [8], [9]. During the recent epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the use of chest CT in combination with clinical findings was reported to be useful in ruling out a number of differential diagnoses [10]. Thin-section CT may have advantages over conventional chest radiography in the etiologic diagnosis of CAP. However, we are not aware of any prospective study investigating the usefulness of thin-section CT as a possible modality for distinguishing the different pathogens of pneumonia. The aim of this study was to elucidate the differences in thin-section CT findings between bacterial and non-bacterial pneumonia. As a part of this study, differences between two representative forms of CAP, i.e., pneumococcal pneumonia and mycoplasmal pneumonia, were also examined [11].",

The candidates for enrollment were the same candidates from the etiological study reported previously, i.e., all hospitalized CAP patients over 15 years of age [11]. CAP patients were designated as those who developed symptoms outside of any hospital or healthcare institution and presented with symptoms of respiratory infection such as cough, sputum or dyspnea, and infiltrate on chest radiography. Conventional chest CT and thin-section CT evaluations were performed on the hospitalized CAP patients who gave their informed consent. Prior to the study, the protocol was approved by the institutional review board. Patients were excluded from this study if they had at least one of the following conditions: inability to hold one\u2019s breathing sufficiently to perform a chest CT, shock, consciousness disturbance, thoracic deformity, an underlying lung disease (pulmonary emphysema, bronchiectasis, interstitial pneumonia, old tuberculosis, etc.) that could skew the thin-section CT findings, an underlying immunodeficiency and possible pregnancy.

A p\n < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. Candidate predictors with p\n < 0.10 were selected and used in multivariate logistic regression analysis to construct the prediction equations for bacterial pneumonia versus non-bacterial pneumonia (model 1, with or without underlying lung diseases; model 2, without underlying lung diseases), and pneumococcal pneumonia versus mycoplasmal pneumonia (model 3). Standard errors (S.E.), p-values of the likelihood ratio test, and estimated coefficients for independent variables (\u03b2) were determined. Probabilities of bacterial pneumonia (model 1 and 2) and pneumococcal pneumonia (model 3) were calculated for all patients in each group using the logistic model P\n = 1 \u2212 1/(1 + \ne\nr) and r\n = [k\n + \u03a3\u03b2\ni\n \u00d7 (0 or 1)].

The only difference between thin-section CT manifestations of H. influenzae pneumonia and pneumococcal pneumonia was in the detection of lobar pneumonia: zero out of 12 (0%) in the former versus 20 out of 59 (34%) in the latter. Thin-section CT findings on chlamydial pneumonia were non-specific, with relatively less frequent airspace nodules, lobular opacity, and centrilobular nodules compared to mycoplasmal pneumonia. However, in comparing bacterial and non-bacterial pneumonia, several of the findings were found to occur at significantly different frequencies. Lobular opacity, centrilobular nodules, and thickening of bronchovascular bundles were more frequent in non-bacterial pneumonia (p\n = 0.002, p\n = 0.001 and p\n = 0.001, respectively) (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3\n). Prominent centrilobular nodules appeared as the main shadow more frequently in non-bacterial pneumonia cases in 7 out of 31 (23%) (p\n = 0.001), with a specificity of 98% (92 out of 94) (Fig. 2). Areas of AS and areas of \u2018GG located around AS\u2019 were more frequently observed in bacterial pneumonia (p\n = 0.017 and p\n = 0.039, respectively) (Fig. 4\n), but these findings were non-specific. Airspace nodules in bacterial pneumonia (Fig. 5\n) and centrilobular nodules in non-bacterial pneumonia (Fig. 3) tended to be located in the outer areas of the lung parenchyma (p\n = 0.023 and p\n = 0.001), with high specificities of 94% (29 out of 31) and 89% (84 out of 94) despite low sensitivities of 26% (24 out of 94) and 39% (12 out of 31), respectively. Bilateral centrilobular nodules were seen more frequently in non-bacterial pneumonia (p\n = 0.007), with a sensitivity of 32% (10 out of 31) and specificity of 90% (85 out of 94). Interlobular septal thickening tended to be seen more often in bacterial pneumonias (p\n = 0.087) (Fig. 6\n). The interobserver agreements (\u03ba statistics) for the thin-section CT findings were 0.68 for centrilobular nodules, 0.50 for airspace nodules, 0.53 for lobular opacity, 0.71 for areas of AS, and 0.64 for areas of GG.",

Tanaka et al. showed that the frequencies of several thin-section CT findings differed significantly between two types of pneumonia. Moreover, the thin-section CT findings generally correlated well with pathogenesis and pathological findings [6]. In a study that covered both immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients, Reittner et al. concluded that thin-section CT is of limited value in the differential diagnosis of infective pneumonias, even though the pneumonias caused by M. pneumoniae and Pneumocystis carinii exhibited characteristic appearances in thin-section CT [5]. In previous studies, because the decisions to perform CT scans were made mostly by clinical judgment and thin-section CT studies in CAP were not performed prospectively [5], [6], [8], [9], the problem of selection bias needs to be considered. Two types of selection bias are involved: bias in selecting the examination with which to detect the causative organisms, and bias in selecting the cases to undergo thin-section CT on the basis of already known clinical information and roentgenological findings. The present study was conducted in a prospective manner in order to minimize these biases. Moreover, this study has fulfilled a need in providing a description of thin-section CT findings on pneumonias caused by the common pathogens S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae which had not been adequately described in previous thin-section CT reports.",

[5], was more commonly found in bacterial pneumonia than in non-bacterial pneumonia in our study. This may be due to the progression of the inflammation in bacterial pneumonias. On the other hand, the primary pathologic lesions of mycoplasma infection are known to be limited to the ciliated respiratory epithelium from the trachea to the bronchioles [15]. This propensity of mycoplasma infection to affect the airways has been shown in histopathological [17] and radiological [5], [7], [18], [19] studies. Our data on centrilobular nodules corroborated a study by Reittner et al., who observed the nodules in 96% of M. pneumoniae pneumonias and in 100% of viral pneumonias, versus only 17% of bacterial pneumonias [5]. Conceivably, centrilobular nodules are specific to non-bacterial pneumonias when seen as the prominent finding (specificity of 98%), bilaterally (90%), or predominantly in the outer lung zone (89%), inasmuch as none of these localizations showed high sensitivity (23%, 39% and 32%, respectively). Patients with H. influenzae pneumonia often have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and the saprophytic bacteria within the bronchial epithelium of these cases may trigger episodes of bronchopneumonia [16]. A pathologic pattern of airspace pneumonia similar to that in pneumococcal pneumonia can also occur [16]. The only detectable difference between pneumococcal pneumonia and H. influenzae pneumonia in our study was the appearance of lobar pneumonia (0% versus 34% frequency, respectively). Chlamydial pneumonia showed similarities and differences with mycoplasmal pneumonia in thin-section CT findings [8], [9]. The disease showed a wide range of non-specific thin-section CT findings including both airspace pneumonia and bronchopneumonia. A histological investigation in an experimental model of Chlamydial pneumonia revealed inflammatory cell infiltration within the interstitium and alveolar space, accompanied by perivascular and peribronchiolar lymphoid cell accumulations [20].",

Further, thin-section CT examination was inapplicable to various subgroups of patients, including those with severe conditions that prevented them from holding their breath, those suffering from underlying diseases with marked distortion of the lung architecture, and those with immunocompromised conditions. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was one of the most frequent co-morbidities in hospitalized patients with CAP (16%) [11]. Many of these were not included in this study in order to avoid misinterpretation of thin-section CT findings. In patients with immunodeficiency, a wider range of microorganisms including Pneumocystis jirovecii, Aspergillus and Mycobacteria can cause pneumonia [5]. Consequently, six immunocompromised patients were excluded from the CT study. Investigation of immunocompromised patients is obviously needed to determine whether thin-section CT would be useful in differentiating causative organisms and should be analyzed separately from immunocompetent patients. Moreover, we were not able to evaluate CT findings of Legionella pneumonia because we had estimated at the outset of this study that we would have only a small number of Legionella cases that are more frequently encountered in Western countries based on previously reported studies [11], [21]. Regarding methodology, using modern picture achieving and communication systems with narrower image intervals could have enabled more accurate evaluations of the images compared to using hard-copy films. Finally, the multivariate logistic regression model employed in this study was laborious and not entirely appropriate in the daily clinical setting. Further studies in which thin-section CT findings of pneumonia are evaluated by a simpler method are clearly needed.",
