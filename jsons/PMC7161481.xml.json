This epidemic had spread to 206 countries and territories around the world and 2 international conveyances with 1,203,459 confirmed cases, including 64,754 deaths, as of April 05, 2020, so the World Health Organization declared it as a Public Health Emergency of worldwide (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/). Similarly, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) had become a worldwide health concern. MERS-CoV originally reported in 2012 (De Wit et al., 2016). It affected more than 2000 people in 27 countries and 4 sub-continents in the Middle East. While the epidemic of SARS affected 26 countries and resulted in more than 8000 cases in 2003 (De Wit et al., 2016). Since then, a small number of cases have occurred as a result of laboratory accidents or, possibly, through animal-to-human transmission (Guangdong, China) (De Wit et al., 2016).",

This virus is transmitted from person to person via droplet transmission (Li et al., 2020; Ozaslan et al., 2020). Therefore, the virus is spreading easily in overcrowded areas. Most patients experience only mild to moderate symptoms, such as high body temperature in conjunction with some respiratory symptoms such as cough, sore throat, and headache. Some people may have severe symptoms like pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (Chen et al., 2020). Also, individuals with underlying complications such as heart disease, chronic lung disease, or diabetes potentially display more severe symptoms (Adhikari et al., 2020). Preventive measures such as masks, frequent hand washing, staying home when sick, avoid public contact, and quarantines are being recommended for reducing the transmission. To date, no specific antiviral treatment is proven effective, hence, infected people initially rely on symptomatic treatments that showed encouraging profile for blocking the new coronavirus in early clinical trials.",

SARS-CoV-2 such as the NCBI Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 database (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/jkj/s7915/202001/e4e2d5e6f01147e0a8df3f6701d49f33.shtml) and NGDC Genome Warehouse (bigd.big.ac.cn/gwh/) make the genomic information publicly available, together with epidemiological data for the sequenced isolates. The data sharing requires users to agree to collaborate with, and appropriately credit, all data contributors. A notable success of this initiative has been the contribution of countries, such as China, Philippines, and Japan, etc. which have previously been reticent about placing data in the public domain. The WHO also supports the endeavor of rapid publication of all available sequences for coronaviruses and there is hope that comprehensive submission to public databases will soon become a reality.",

The collective outcomes recommend that the ORF1b nsp 12, 14 and 16 proteins characterize particular cistrons, while the distorted ORF1a proteins nsps 4, 5, and 10 form a compartment together at the location of the coding sequence of ORF1ab (Graham et al., 2008). Notably, of the eight announced mutations in MHV, seven of the influenced amino acid deposits are correlated with SARS-CoV (Graham et al., 2008). This methodology may permit the determination of phenotypic travelers that will distinguish by protein interactions. Also, it will permit the progressions to be acquainted in SARS-CoV with deciding whether the ts phenotype can be reproduced in that foundation, with the chance of quickly building up a board of SARS-CoV. Curiously, not only is the slow-growth branch dominated by travelers, but the COVID-19 lineages appear to be phylogenetically related to each other, suggesting an exposure point for these individuals that are distinct from the rest of the population.",
