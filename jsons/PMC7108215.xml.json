Since real time PCR reactions are performed in a closed system (no gel analysis needed) the risk of contamination has been substantially reduced. This has also reduced the requirement for a stringent laboratory structure. The increasing number of commercially available real time PCR chemistries and platforms has led to significant reductions in its overall cost.",

After further multiplexing our respiratory service still consists of five separate assays but can now detect 17 different viral and bacterial pathogens. In 2007, we applied the same principles to our non-respiratory diagnostic service. In this case all the multiplex assays were designed to test certain sample types that represent different disease syndromes. This work has reduced the number of tests carried out from 21 to 9 (Table 2\n).",

The proposed multiplex assay was compared to the singleplex using end-point detection limit experiments, specificity panels, and panels of clinical samples (positives and negatives). Other factors such as robustness, reproducibility and, if relevant, linearity and quantitation accuracy were also assessed.

This reduces sensitivity of a part of the multiplex (always the target that is not preferentially amplified) and can result in false negative results.

            "text": "The preferred dyes for triplex assays are FAM, VIC and Cy5.22 These dye combinations work on most assay platforms and are commonly used by researchers. These dyes are chosen because the excitation and emission wavelengths are different enough to allow accurate detection of each, reducing the risk of crosstalk. Crosstalk is when the fluorescence increase associated with one dye spills over into another channel that is being used to detect another dye. This leads to two positive results: one real and one not. Sometimes a strong FAM signal can also be detected in the VIC channel resulting in a false positive result. Some PCR platforms can also confuse large increases in VIC-Tamra signals as increases in the background calibration dye ROX. Subsequently, the platform will reduce the fluorescence levels of the dyes detected in all wells which on some occasions can result in false negative traces or strange traces. In most cases crosstalk can be eliminated with appropriate test optimisation (e.g. reducing or increasing the amount of dye/probe present without any loss in test sensitivity) or PCR platform re-calibration.",

Our laboratory tests are carried out on either the ABI7500 or the Rotorgene PCR platforms. On the ABI 7500, Tamra bidopy & NED are the recommended 4th dyes whereas Texas Red & ROX are suggested for the Rotorgene 3000. However, despite this guidance significant crosstalk was encountered. For example, when using Tamra biodopy positive traces were found in all dye channels (Fig. 1A) and positive Texas Red traces on the Rotorgene were found to appear in the Cy5 channel. Careful optimisation could not rectify this issue and the machine calibration was not at fault. This was eliminated by using ROX as the 4th dye on both platforms (Fig. 1B). It should be noted that using ROX as a probe dye is not recommended for some ABI PCR platforms as it is commonly used as a reference dye. However, this function can be \u201cswitched off\u201d and we have found no problems when using this as the fourth dye in our qualitative tests. It should also be noted that some PCR kits will come with ROX already added and therefore may not be of use in this situation.",

The inclusion of the parechovirus test will increase the detection rate in patients with enterovirus like illnesses whereas the inclusion of human metapneumovirus, influenza C, parainlfuenza 4, the coronaviruses NL63, OC43, 229e has lead to increases in the overall viral detection rate in respiratory samples.
