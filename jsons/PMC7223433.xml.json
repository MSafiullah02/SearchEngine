            "text": "The methodology team developed evidence summaries for each PICO question, including information on study design, population, intervention, pooled estimates of effect for each outcome, and a rating of the overall quality of evidence. We rated the certainty of evidence for each outcome as \u201chigh\u201d, \u201cmoderate\u201d, \u201clow\u201d, and \u201cvery low\u201d. In accordance with GRADE, the task force initially categorized the certainty of evidence for each outcome as high if it originated from RCTs and low if it originated from observational data. We subsequently rated down the quality of the evidence by one or two levels if results from individual studies were at serious or very serious risk of bias [31], there were serious inconsistencies in the results across studies, [32], the evidence was indirect [33], the data were imprecise [34], or publication bias was thought to be likely. Evidence from observational data could be rated upwards if effect sizes were large, there was evidence of a dose\u2013response gradient, or all plausible confounding would either reduce a demonstrated effect or suggest a spurious effect when results showed no effect. Following GRADE guidance, panelists considered the relative effect sizes and absolute effect sizes and also inspected the 95% CIs to see if they crossed thresholds relevant to decision-making [33]. The chairs and methodologists ensured that the judgements of effect sizes were consistently applied between panel groups addressing each PICO.",

While the effect estimates appear to favour liberal transfusion strategies, the certainty of evidence is low. Of concern was the fact that the two largest trials, which contributed virtually all events to the pooled estimates, are single centre trials, which tend to produce exaggerated effects [72]. Moreover, both trials are from the same centre, raising questions about the external validity of these studies. Further complicating the recommendation is the fact that one trial is in patients with septic shock, a population specifically addressed in a PICO question in this guideline, where more robust multi-centre data from TRISS do not favour liberal transfusion [40]. The inconsistency of these data compared to other ICU subgroups, coupled with the large effect sizes, resulted in an absence of consensus within the TF about restrictive (7 g/dL) versus liberal (9 g/dL) transfusion threshold. Even within the TF, there was a wide variety of practice including both these thresholds.",

The physiological more advanced parameters like acidosis, arrhythmia, ECG changes, ScvO2, SvO2 are infrequently used [25, 74].

The study by Dolman et al. found no cost differences from the laboratory testing point of view, but did not assess the overall cost effectiveness when considering other hospital resources (e.g. need for transfusion) [118]. Lastly, these tubes are often already used in children and Jehovah\u2019s witnesses, more widespread use would improve equity by providing blood-conserving treatment to all critically ill patients.

The panel\u2019s recommendation to not provide platelet transfusions in this range is consistent with multiple guidelines that recommend a platelet threshold of 50 \u00d7 109/L prior to major surgery [135]. The panel also chose to make a strong recommendation against platelet transfusion for platelet counts > 100 \u00d7 109/L despite the low quality of the evidence for lack of benefit because of the high-quality evidence of likely wasteful resource use and rare harm. The strong recommendation despite very low certainty evidence is justified using one of GRADE\u2019s five rationales for a strong recommendation/low certainty evidence situation: potentially equivalent options, one clearly less risky or costly than the other [36]. Lastly, the panel does not make a recommendation regarding platelet transfusion prior to procedures for patients with platelet counts < 10 \u00d7 109/L.
