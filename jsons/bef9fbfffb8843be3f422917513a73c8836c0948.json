When practitioners speak of BM25, they most likely refer to the implementation in the Lucene open-source search library. Does this ambiguity \"matter\"? We attempt to answer this question with a large-scale reproducibility study of BM25, considering eight variants. Experiments on three newswire collections show that there are no significant effectiveness differences between them, including Lucene's often maligned approximation of document length. As an added benefit, our empirical approach takes advantage of databases for rapid IR prototyping, which validates both the feasibility and methodological advantages claimed in previous work.",

Also, researchers using different IR systems report (sometimes quite) different effectiveness measurements for their implementation of BM25, even on the same test collections; consider for example the results reported in OSIRRC 2019, the open-source IR replicability challenge at SIGIR 2019 [2] .

As an alternative, it is possible to \"export\" the inverted index to a relational database and recast the document ranking problem into a database (specifically, SQL) query. Varying the scoring function, then, corresponds to varying the expression for calculating the score in the SQL query, allowing us to explore different BM25 variants by expressing them declaratively (instead of programming imperatively).

The proposal is to add a lower-bound bonus when a term appears at least one time in a document. The difference with BM25L is a constant \u03b4 to the TF component. The IDF component is again changed to a variant that disallows negative values. [3] is an approach that varies k 1 per term (i.e., uses term specific k 1 values). In order to determine the optimal value for k 1 , the method starts by identifying the probability of a term occurring at least once in a document as (df r + 0.5)/(N + 1). The probability of the term occurring one more time is then defined as (df r+1 + 0.5)/(df r + 1). The information gain of a term occurring r + 1 instead of r times is defined as G r q = log 2 ((df r+1 + 0.5)/(df r + 1)) \u2212 log 2 ((df tr + 0.5)/(N + 1)), where df r is defined as follows: |D t|c td \u2265r\u22120.5 | if r > 1, df t if r = 1, and N if r = 0 (c td is the same as in BM25L).

[6] ; following that work we use MonetDB as well. Evaluations with Lucene (default) and Lucene (accurate) were performed directly in Anserini; the latter was based on previously-released code that we updated and incorporated into Anserini. 2 The inverted index was exported from Lucene to OldDog, ensuring that all experiments share exactly the same document processing pipeline (tokenization, stemming, stopword removal, etc.). While exporting the inverted index, we precalculate all k 1 values for BM25adpt as suggested by Lv and Zhai [3] . As an additional verification step, we implemented both Lucene (default) and Lucene (accurate) in OldDog and compared results to the output from Anserini. We are able to confirm that the results are the same, setting aside unavoidable differences related to floating point precision. All BM25 variants are then implemented in OldDog as minor variations upon the original SQL query provided in M\u00fchleisen et al. [6] . The term-specific parameter optimization for the adpt variant was already calculated during the index extraction stage, allowing us to upload the optimal (t, k) pairs and directly use the term-specific k values in the SQL query. The advantage of our experimental methodology is that we did not need to implement a single new ranking function from scratch. All the SQL variants implemented for this paper can be found on GitHub. 3 The experiments use three TREC newswire test collections: TREC Disks 4 and 5, excluding Congressional Record, with topics and relevance judgments from the TREC 2004 Robust Track (Robust04); the New York Times Annotated Corpus, with topics and relevance judgments from the TREC 2017 Common Core Track (Core17); the TREC Washington Post Corpus, with topics and relevance judgments from the TREC 2018 Common Core Track (Core18). Following standard experimental practice, we assess ranked list output in terms of average precision (AP) and precision at rank 30 (P@30). The parameters shared by all models are set to k 1 = 0.9 and b = 0.4, Anserini's defaults. The parameter \u03b4 is set to the value reported as best in the corresponding source publication.

Both an ANOVA and Tukey's HSD show no significant differences between any variant, on all test collections. This confirms the findings of Trotman et al. [11] : Across the IR literature, we find that differences due to more mundane settings (such as the choice of stopwords) are often larger than the differences we observe here. Although we find no significant improvements over the original Robertson et al. [8] formulation, it might still be worthwhile to use a variant of BM25 that avoids negative ranking scores. Comparing Lucene (default) and Lucene (accurate), we find negligible differences in effectiveness. However, the differences in retrieval time are also negligible, which calls into question the motivation behind the original length approximation. Currently, the similarity function and thus the document length encoding are defined at index time. Storing exact document lengths would allow for different ranking functions to be swapped at query time more easily, as no information would be discarded at index time. Accurate document lengths might additionally benefit downstream modules that depend on Lucene. We therefore suggest that Lucene might benefit from storing exact document lengths.",
