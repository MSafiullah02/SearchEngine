The risk of infection or disease in a population is determined by characteristics of the virus, the host, and the host population, as well as behavioral, environmental, and ecological factors that affect virus transmission from one host to another. Epidemiology attempts to meld these factors into a unified whole. The depiction of the interaction of factors favoring the emergence of a viral disease (Figure 1\n), called \u2018the convergence model\u2019, is taken from the US Institute of Medicine study, Microbial Threats to Health, Emergence, Detection and Response (National Academy Press, 2003). At the center is a box representing the convergence of factors leading to \u2018the black box\u2019, reflecting the reality that many unknown interactions are important virologically and epidemiologically.",

John Snow is called the father of modern epidemiology because he developed excellent quantitative methods while studying the source of a cholera outbreak at the Broad Street pump in London in 1849. Snow was followed by William Farr, who in the 1870s advanced the use of vital statistics and clarified many of the principles of risk assessment and retrospective and prospective studies. Their vision is reflected in the fast-changing science of epidemiology which is now supported by advanced computer technology, sophisticated statistical methods, and very sensitive and specific diagnostic systems.",

With rotaviruses and bluetongue viruses, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the segmented viral RNA has been used epidemiologically, for example, to unravel outbreaks involving multiple viral variants. Panels of monoclonal antibodies have been used to distinguish virus variants for epidemiologic purposes; they have been particularly useful in elucidating host-range and geographic variants of rabies virus. Today, partial sequencing has become the most commonly used molecular epidemiologic methodology; partial sequencing of poliovirus isolates recovered from patients indicates whether they are wild type (even local or introduced wild type), attenuated vaccine type, or a vaccine type that has reacquired neurovirulence during human passage. Partial sequencing of foot-and-mouth disease viruses can offer the same kind of geographic information of virus movement as has proved so useful in polio control and eradication programs, but because of political sensitivities in some countries a robust international reference laboratory system has not been established that could provide the same kind of practical disease control information as has been the case with polio. Thus, with many human and animal viruses molecular epidemiologic studies are flourishing, but more such studies should lead to international reference laboratory systems to guide prevention and control actions. Such studies are developing rapidly today to deal with the threat of a human pandemic of avian influenza, but there are many more viral diseases, especially animal diseases, in need of this kind of development.",

Prediction that the etiologic agent would turn out to be a member of the family Retroviridae was based upon years of veterinary research on animal retroviruses and animal retroviral diseases. This prediction was based upon recognition of common biologic and pathogenetic characteristics of AIDS and animal retroviral diseases. This prediction guided many of the early experiments to find the etiologic agent of AIDS; later, after human immunodeficiency virus (HIV1) was discovered, its morphological similarity to equine infectious anemia virus, a prototypic member of the genus Lentivirus, family Retroviridae, was the key to unraveling confusion over the fact that the human virus killed host lymphocytes rather than transforming them as typical oncogenic retroviruses would do. Ever since, this essence of comparative medicine has been guiding HIV/AIDS research in many areas, including drug design, diagnostics, and vaccine development. HIV/AIDS epidemiologic research has often been intertwined with research on the several simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs).",

Overall, subclinical infections are much more common than those that result in disease. Their relative frequency accounts for the difficulty of tracing chains of transmission, even with the help of laboratory diagnostics. Although clinical cases may be somewhat more productive sources of virus than subclinical infections, because the latter do not restrict the movement of the infected host, they can be most important as sources of viral dissemination. In most acute infections, whether clinically apparent or not, virus is shed in highest titers during the late stages of the incubation period, before the influence of the host-immune response takes effect. Persistent infections, whether or not they are associated with episodes of clinical disease, also play an important role in the perpetuation of many viruses in nature. For example, prolonged virus shedding can reintroduce virus into a population of susceptibles all of which have been born since the last clinically apparent episode of infection. This is important in the survival of rubella virus in some isolated populations. Sometimes the persistence of infection, the production of disease, and the transmission of virus are dissociated; for example, togavirus and arenavirus infections may have little adverse effect on their reservoir hosts (arthropods, birds, and rodents), but transmission may be very efficient. On the other hand, the persistence of infection in the central nervous system, as with measles virus in subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), is of no epidemiological significance, since no infectious virus is shed from this site.",

In general, for rapidly and efficiently transmitted viruses such as many respiratory viruses, local survival of the virus requires that the susceptible host population be very large. A virus may disappear from a population because it exhausts its potential supply of susceptible hosts as they acquire immunity to reinfection with the same virus. Depending on duration of immunity and the pattern of virus shedding, the \u2018critical population size\u2019 varies considerably with different viruses and with different host species. The most precise data on the importance of population size in acute nonpersistent infections come from studies of measles. Persistence of measles virus in a population depends upon a continuous supply of susceptible children. Analyses of the incidence of measles in large cities and in island communities have shown that a population of about half a million persons is needed to ensure a large enough annual input of new susceptible hosts, by birth or immigration, to maintain measles virus in the population. Because infection depends on respiratory transmission, the duration of epidemics of measles is correlated inversely with population density. If a population is dispersed over a large area, the rate of spread is reduced and the epidemic may last longer, so that the number of susceptible persons needed to maintain transmission chains is reduced. On the other hand, in such a situation a break in the transmission chain is much more likely. When a large proportion of the population is initially susceptible, the intensity of the epidemic builds up very quickly and attack rates are almost 100% (\u2018virgin-soil epidemic\u2019). On the other hand, when measles vaccination programs are implemented properly the virus disappears completely from the regional population.",

            "text": "Because most viruses are host-restricted, most viral infections are maintained in nature within populations of the same or related species. However, there are a number of viruses that may have multiple hosts and spread naturally between several different species of vertebrate host, for example, rabies and eastern equine encephalitis viruses. The term \u2018zoonosis\u2019 is used to describe multiple-host infections that are transmissible from animals to man. The zoonoses, whether involving domestic or wild animals or arthropods, usually represent important problems only under conditions where humans are engaged in activities involving close contact with animals or exposure to arthropods.",

            "text": "Many viral zoonoses are caused by arboviruses. Arboviruses have two classes of hosts, vertebrate and invertebrate. Over 500 arboviruses are known, of which about 100 cause disease in humans and 40 in domestic animals; some of these are transmitted by ticks, some by mosquitoes, and yet others by phlebotomine flies (sandflies) or Culicoides spp. (midges). Arthropod transmission may be \u2018mechanical\u2019, where the arthropod acts as a \u2018flying pin\u2019, or more commonly, \u2018biological\u2019, involving replication of the virus in the arthropod vector. The arthropod vector acquires virus by feeding on the blood of a viremic person or animal. Replication of the ingested virus, initially in the arthropod's gut, and its spread to the salivary glands takes several days; the interval varies with different viruses and is influenced by ambient temperature. Virions in the salivary secretions of the vector are injected into human or animal hosts during subsequent blood meals. Most arboviruses have localized natural habitats in which specific receptive arthropod and vertebrate hosts are involved in the viral life cycle. Vertebrate reservoir hosts are usually wild mammals or birds; humans are rarely involved in primary transmission cycles, although the exceptions to this generalization are important (e.g., Venezuelan equine encephalitis, yellow fever, and dengue viruses). Humans are in most cases infected incidentally, for example, by the geographic extension of a reservoir vertebrate host and/or a vector arthropod. Ecological changes produced by human activities disturb natural arbovirus life cycles and have been incriminated in the geographic spread or increased prevalence of arbovirus diseases.",

With the development of computer-based mathematical modeling techniques, there has been a resurgence of interest in the population dynamics of infectious diseases. There has also been a resurgence in controversies surrounding the use of models; critics say \u2018for every model there is an equal and opposite model\u2019. So, the proof of the value of models lies in their practical application, and in recent years there have been more and more successes. For example, when for counterterrorism reasons universal smallpox vaccination was being considered, models that showed that vaccine could be used effectively after rapid detection of a terrorism incident led to a decision to stockpile, but not widely use vaccine. As another example, when a foot-and-mouth disease epidemic raged in the United Kingdom in 2001, a model showed that only the most vigorous stamping-out campaign could get ahead of the movement of the virus across the country. The model, seeming eminently logical now, importantly provided the kind of veracity and political will needed to accelerate the stamping-out campaign.",

Computer modeling also provides useful insights into the effectiveness of disease control programs. Much attention has been given to modeling the future of the AIDS epidemic in the United States and the rest of the world. Such models usually start with historical data on the introduction of the etiologic virus, HIV1, proceed to the present stage of the epidemic where the disease has become well established in many countries and in fewer countries subject to prevention and treatment strategies, and then proceed to project its course into the future. During the first 10 years of the AIDS epidemic in the United States, African countries, and then in Asian countries, most models underestimated developing trends; more recently models have become more accurately predictive \u2013 but in many places more and more sobering.",
