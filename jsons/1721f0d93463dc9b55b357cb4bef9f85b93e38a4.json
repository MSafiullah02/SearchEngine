In light of the uncertainty with COVID-19, physical therapists are required to socially distance themselves at least 6 feet apart in health care institutions, and patients and clients cannot access necessary physical therapy services in the community due to shelter-in-place and stay-at-home restrictions. Furthermore, this unique situation magnifies the challenges and opportunities in digital practice, as practitioners may lack the necessary telehealth competencies identified in the literature. 2, 3 Therefore, it is especially important for physical therapy practitioners to consider key recommendations for safe and effective digital practice delivery.",

In fact, both telehealth and e-visits have been approved by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in the United States during the COVID-19 crisis on a temporarily basis. 6 CMS noted that telehealth services provided by interactive audio and video telecommunications systems permit real-time communication between end-to-end users, whereas e-visits are non-face-to-face, patient-initiated digital communications requiring a clinical decision that otherwise typically would have been provided in the office. 6 However, specific federal and state payer guidelines, regulatory hurdles, and patient privacy barriers persist, requiring permanent fixes from CMS on telehealth and e-visits. 7 For example, health care providers on the front lines of COVID-19 have identified that some older adults prefer telephone use to digital telecommunication interactions because of a lack of technology understanding and training. 7 In order to address this immediate crisis and patient preferences, Keesara and colleagues 8 recommend expansion of telehealth broadly to include digital tools-beyond interactive audio and video-that offer 256-bit end-to-end encryption, including telephone services.",

The body of evidence in relation to telerehabilitation 5 is limited, however. Telerehabilitation tends to require more provider time for consultations, and it is unclear whether telerehabilitation improves access to beneficial services. 9 With paucity of definitive evidence in the wake of COVID-19, the joint task force believed it is not possible to recommend conditionspecific digital practice standards. Hence, guiding principles should be reviewed by the physical therapy profession until such evidence is available. 4 The task force developed each principle based on current practice, research, and regulatory considerations that may evolve over time (Figure) .",

The cities that implemented multiple interventions early in the pandemic fared better than those cities that did not have plans for surge capacity that lacked public engagement on general health isolation approaches based on scientific data whenever possible, and that did not design orderly and ethical distribution of scarce resources. These lessons may be applied to the current COVID-19 pandemic as we advance digital physical and telehealth at local and international levels; however, lingering issues persist for adoption of digital physical therapist practice. For example, should the physical therapy profession be able to determine the steps necessary to implement both in-person care and digital physical therapy practice? What could occur during a surge capacity that might limit broadband connectivity locally and internationally? What is the role of the health care provider in digital practice during shelter-in-place and stay-athome restrictions? What is the service user's role and physical therapist engagement during social isolation, and what are the care approaches for proper exercise, movement, and wellness? How could physical therapy practitioners and physical therapist students in collaboration deliver this care safely? How would they limit risk of fraud and abuse resulting from rapid adoption of digital physical therapy services? And, how does the physical therapy profession move forward ethically with equitable distributions of scarce resources in environments with limited digital technology?",
