This approach makes it possible to compare models and configurations, however it also decouples the explanation from the evaluation. With the adoption of neural re-ranking models, where the scoring process is arguably more complex than traditional retrieval methods, the divide between result score and the reasoning behind it becomes even stronger. Because neural models learn based on data, they are more likely to evade our intuition about how their components should behave. Having a thorough understanding of neural reranking models is important for anybody who wants to analyze or deploy these models [6, 7] .",

In the cluster header we display a manually assigned summary title, the median result of the queries, and median difference to the initial BM25 ranking, as this is the basis for the re-ranking. Each query is displayed with the rank of the first relevant document, the difference to BM25, and the query text.

The header controls allow to highlight the connections between the query and document terms in two different ways. First, users can choose a minimum cosine similarity that a term pair must exceed to be colored, which is a simple way of exploring the semantic similarity of the word representations. Secondly, for kernel-pooling models that we support, we offer a highlight mode much closer to how the neural model sees the document: based on the association of a term to a kernel.
