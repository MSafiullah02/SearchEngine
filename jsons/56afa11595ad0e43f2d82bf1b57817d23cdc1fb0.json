In the alveolar epithelial cells, the virus activates innate immune and adaptive immune systems, resulting in the release of a large number of cytokines, including IL-6, IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), interferon-\u03b3-inducible protein (IP10), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP1), macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP1A), inducing a cytokine storm [2] , that occurs in a large number of patients with severe COVID-19 [3] . G-CSF and IL-6 are the key cytokines leading to inflammatory storm which may result in impaired oxygen diffusion and eventually lead to respiratory failure. Therefore, some authors have suggested that interfering of IL-6 might be a potentially beneficial for severe and critical COVID-19 [2] .",

More recently, favorable changes of CT findings (size reduction of consolidations and ground glass opacities) were reported in a 64-year-old man 14 days after the administration of tocilizumab as a treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia in Milan, Italy [5] . Moreover, a 57-year-old patient in Switzerland with insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes mellitus and interstitial lung disease associated with systemic sclerosis treated with tocilizumab developed a mild form of COVID-19, suggesting that IL-6blocking treatment given for chronic diseases may even prevent the development of severe COVID-19 [6] .",
