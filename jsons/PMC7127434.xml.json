The European Environment Agency (EEA) [2] has reported seven types of pollutants that people are exposed to, namely, particulate matter (PM), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), heavy metals, as well as benzene (C6H6), and benzopyrene (BaP). All of these pollutants are primarily or secondarily related to road traffic (fossil fuel combustion). The World Health Organization (WHO) [1] has therefore explicitly recommended the concentration limits for various air pollutants such as O3 and NO2.",

Nonetheless, the roadside concentration of NO2 continues to increase [4]. Similar findings are also being reported in Europe by EEA [2]. High hourly, daily, and annual average concentrations of NO2 have been recorded at the road-side stations in the Central, Causeway Bay, and Mong Kok areas in Hong Kong. Air pollution far exceeds the limits recommended by the WHO [4]. The three areas are high-density metropolitan areas and traffic hotspots. As shown in Fig. 1\n, vehicles crowd the streets of high-density urban areas in Hong Kong. The reported higher concentration of NO2 is the result of the larger NO2 percentage in total traffic emissions [2], [5] and of poorer urban air ventilation in high-density urban areas [6], [7]. The bulky building blocks, compacted urban volumes and very limited open spaces seriously block the pollutant dispersion in these deep street canyons [8], [9]. Therefore, apart from having control measures to decrease vehicle emissions, understanding pollutant dispersion as related to the urban planning and design mechanism is necessary in order to guide policymakers, planners, and architects in making better evidence-based decisions.",

Therefore, the reciprocal relationship between them requires research on the environmental sensitivity of urban planning and design, in order to positively address their negative consequences on urban air quality. Mirzaei and Haghighat [21] provided a systematic approach to quantify the outside environment in the street canyon. Huang et al. [20] studied an actual urban case of mid-density layouts. Hang et al. [8] conducted a study on the effects of varying building heights on street level air pollutant dispersion and Eefents et al. [22] reported the effects of canyon indicators such as Sky View Factor (SVF) on the concentration of NO and NOx. Buccolieri et al. [23] clarified the influence of the building packing density on the pollutant concentration. Richmond-Bryant [24] related the fluid properties and canyon geometries, such as the Reynolds number and canyon height, with air pollutant retention by field measurement data at Manhattan and Oklahoma. However, the direct understandings for design strategies behind a decrease in pollutant concentration through urban morphological mechanisms, particularly for high-density cities, remains little known. Further parametric studies are needed to extend the study findings for practical design applications. Bridging the knowledge gap between high-density urban design and air pollutant dispersion mechanisms in the urban street canyons is necessary to provide guidance for planners, designers and policymakers.",

The study aims to provide important and sufficiently accurate insights at the beginning stage of the design practice. These insights are helpful to avoid the mistakes that cannot be easily corrected at the late stages of the design practice. The results of this study are intended to facilitate a paradigm shift from the typical experience-based ways of designing and planning to a more scientific, evidence-based process of decision making, which is necessary to cope with the needs of designing high density cities [28].",

Secondly, a series of parametric studies is conducted to understand the relationship among building geometry, urban permeability, and air pollutant dispersion. These studies evaluate the effects of future urban developments, based on the current planning trend, on air pollutant dispersion in the street canyons. The knowledge of the efficacy of various mitigation strategies for better air quality at urban areas is provided. Given the finite land resources in high-density cities and the numerous planning and design restrictions for development projects, the evaluation of the effectiveness of mitigation strategies is needed to optimize the benefits. To avoid reducing the land use efficiency, the plot ratio in all of the cross-comparison scenarios are same.",

The Eulerian and the Lagrangian methods are widely used to model air pollutant dispersion [15], [30], [31]. Compared with the Lagrangian method, which considers the species as a discrete phase, the Eulerian method considers species as a continuous phase and is solved based on a control volume, which is similar in form to that for the fluid phase [30], [31]. Therefore, the Eulerian method is more convenient for calculating the air pollutant concentration, which was the index this study used to evaluate air pollutant dispersion. Another reason for choosing the Eulerian method was that it has lower computational demands than the Lagrangian method, which needs to track more than several million particles in the large computational domain for outdoor environment simulation. The Eulerian method has been validated by researchers comparing the simulated data with wind tunnel experiment results [15], [30].",

For example, the results of the parametric study of the wing wall for room ventilation by Givoni [39] were implemented by the Hong Kong government [40]. For results of parametric studies to be relevant, scenarios should resemble the reality [40]. An urban-scale model is therefore used in this study to obtain realistic parametric simulation results. As shown in Fig. 4\n, the parametric geometric models were established based on the actual urban conditions in Mong Kok (a high density downtown area in Hong Kong) using a regular street grid. This model should realistically resemble air flows and air pollutant dispersion status in the actual street canyons.

The analysis and discussion of the results of this study revealed the following scientific understandings for the decision-making in high-density urban planning and design activities:1)The SST \u03ba\u2013\u03c9 model can simulate the species transport in a street canyon with high accuracy and can be considered as a good design tool in urban planning and architecture design for air pollutant problems, due to the low computational cost. The performances of various modeling methods (LES and RANS) that are provided by ANSYS Fluent were investigated by cross-comparing with wind tunnel experiment results. Although LES is clearly more accurate than the RANS, the accuracy of the RANS model is sufficient to test the effects of planning and design activities on air pollutant concentration. Among the RANS models, the SST \u03ba\u2013\u03c9 model had the best performance because of the special near-wall region treatment using the standard \u03ba\u2013\u03c9 model.2)The simulation results validated that mitigation strategies for the air pollutant dispersion are necessary in the planning and design of high-density urban areas. In current urban conditions, traffic air pollutants are seriously concentrated in the deep street canyon. If current planning and design activities do not change, these conditions will worsen with future urban development. Given the negative effects of air pollution on public health and that of the high population density in Hong Kong, mitigation strategies are necessary to alleviate this impact.3)The impacts of various urban planning and design strategies to improve air quality in both street canyons for pedestrian and inside adjacent buildings were quantitatively investigated and cross-compared in parametric studies. Policy makers can determine what needs to be changed by having a better understanding of how to select appropriate mitigation strategies in particular planning and design cases to mitigate the negative effects of air pollutant on the surrounding environments. Strategies recommended in this study can be applied into both the new project design and the urban redevelopment. The advantage of this kind of building-scale strategies is that they allow the urban redevelopment to be done step by step, one building by one building. It is more practical than the redevelopment done in one time.This study noted that the air pollutant dispersion in high-density cities can occur if strategies which promote convection effects, such as building separation, porosity, and stepped podium void, are implemented and could be more efficient than strategies for larger turbulence diffusion, such as building setback. Unlike what the AVA understanding indicates, pedestrian-level pollutant concentration depends on the permeability of the entire street canyon. Although a high building porosity off ground level cannot increase the wind speed at pedestrian level, it can decrease pedestrian-level air pollutant concentrations. In the design and planning process, appropriate strategies need to be chosen based on the particular concerns in different projects.4)Simulation results indicated that both the prevailing wind direction and urban permeability are important to estimate the direction of pedestrian level pollutant dispersion in high-density cities. Low urban permeability in high-density urban areas could reverse air flow near the ground, allowing air pollutants to disperse into the windward area of the pollutant sources.5)By integrating the horizontal and vertical permeability based on Counihan's surface roughness model, a new permeability index \u03bb\ni was introduced to estimate the spatially averaged c\u00af at the pedestrian area. The efficiency of this index was validated by a linear regression analysis. This result provided a possibility for mapping air quality in the urban areas with traffic volume data by using GIS technology.\n",

Accordingly, field measurement or wind tunnel studies are necessary to validate the chemical reaction modeling. On the other hand, this study is the first stage of research on a planning and design guideline for urban air quality.
