[2] [3] [4] [5] [6] Almost 80% of all children have experienced rhinovirus infections by the age of 2 years. 7 Moreover, rhinoviruses are associated with up to five hospitalizations per 1000 children <5 years of age indicating a substantial morbidity in this age group. 2 Rapid detection of respiratory picornaviruses is important to avoid nosocomial transmission to other children, reduce unnecessary antibiotic use, decrease hospital stays, and consequently enhance the cost-effectiveness of medical management. 4, 8, 9 The current method used to detect respiratory picornaviruses is nucleic acid amplification, e.g., polymerase chain reaction (PCR). 10 However, this method is expensive and time-consuming and does not allow for rapid diagnosis. Recently, we have shown that detection of respiratory picornaviruses by immunofluorescence (IF) in children is feasible as a routine diagnostic procedure and may have some advantages over molecular methods. 11 Although PCR is more sensitive in detecting respiratory picornaviruses compared to IF, it remains unknown whether the additionally detected respiratory picornaviruses are always clinically relevant. 11", "cite_spans": [{"start": 159, "end": 160, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 241, "end": 244, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 245, "end": 248, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 249, "end": 252, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 253, "end": 256, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 257, "end": 260, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 350, "end": 351, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 511, "end": 512, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 755, "end": 757, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 758, "end": 760, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 761, "end": 762, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 894, "end": 896, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1197, "end": 1199, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "To address this question, we retrospectively analyzed clinical data of children hospitalized with picornavirus infections to com-1386-6532/$ -see front matter \u00a9 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Viral pneumonia in children has been associated with rhinoviruses. 15 However, their role in the etiology of lower tract infections is subject to debate. The presence of respiratory picornavirus RNA does not necessarily prove a cause-effect relationship and combined viral-bacterial infections are possible. 15 In our study the higher C-reactive protein levels in children who were picornavirus positive only by PCR suggest that some of their symptoms may have been caused by secondary bacterial superinfection [16] [17] [18] and that the highly sensitive xTAG multiplex PCR detected also past symptomatic or asymptomatic viral infections. It has been shown that enterovirus and rhinovirus RNA can persist for several weeks after the onset of symptomatic respiratory infection 6, 19 and is detected in a substantial proportion of children without respiratory symptoms. [19] [20] [21] [22] Thus, the relative insensitivity of IF might be a benefit for clinical practice. 11, 23, 24 As our clinical data were analyzed retrospectively and as we did not collect blood cultures routinely we cannot provide any data to support the hypothesis of a possible bacterial superinfection in these children, but predisposition to bacterial infection after viral infection is well-known. 15 We evaluated the clinical course of respiratory picornavirus monoinfections in healthy children by excluding all children with co-infections and co-morbidities.
