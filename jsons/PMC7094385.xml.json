Till March 2, 2020, more than 80 thousand confirmed cases have been reported in China. Of these cases, 49 thousand were identified in Wuhan City. Identification, isolation and caring for patients early are essential to limit human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events. Following the national recommendations for diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV (the 5th edition) and current status of clinical practice in Hubei Province, RT-PCR analysis was used to detect the causative virus from respiratory secretions. However, some investigators and clinical doctors argued that CT imaging should be served to identify the SARS-CoV-2 infection instead, since quite a bit cases showed progressive multiple peripheral ground-glass opacities in both lungs even the RT-PCR results were negative[1], [2].",
