            "text": "On June 17, 2009, 85 countries had officially reported 39 620 cases of swine-origin influenza A H1N1 virus infection to WHO,1 including 167 deaths. On June 11, 2009, WHO raised the level of influenza pandemic alert from phase five to phase six, officially declaring that a pandemic had began while at the same time stating it was of moderate severity, noting that most infected people, including children, had a mild self-limiting disease.2 In this context, health officials around the world are carefully reviewing their pandemic mitigation protocols. School closure (panel 1\n) is a non-pharmaceutical intervention often suggested for mitigating influenza pandemics.3 In pandemic preparedness plans, rationales for school closures are that children are thought to be important vectors of transmission and more infectious and susceptible to most influenza strains than adults, and high contact rates in schools favour transmission. These are strong arguments in the current situation, where 60% of cases infected with H1N1 are 18 years old or younger4, 5 and many of case clusters have happened in schools. It is therefore hoped that closure of schools during the pandemic might break the chains of transmission, with the following potential benefits: reducing the total number of cases; slowing the epidemic to give more time for vaccine production; and reducing the incidence of cases at the peak of the epidemic, limiting both the stress on health-care systems and peak absenteeism in the general population, and thus increasing community-wide resilience.Panel 1Definitions\u2014types of school closure\nSchool closure\nClosing of a school and sending of all the children and staff home\nClass dismissal\nA school remains open with administrative staff, but most children stay home\nReactive closure\nClosure of a school when many children, staff, or both are experiencing illness\nProactive closure\nClosure of a school or class dismissal before substantial transmission among the school children",

Important operational issues related to school closures, though not impossible to overcome, need preparation (panel 2\n). Communication of the policy to the public also poses challenges, especially in a context where some countries (or even regions within a country) might close schools proactively, others perhaps only reactively, and some not at all. But since historical experience is that many schools close during pandemics just because of high levels of illness-related absenteeism, it would seem sensible for all countries to at least have plans for reactive closure.Panel 2School closure operational issues\n\u2022The potential need for local sensitivity in timing in larger countries as the pandemic spreads; it might not be necessary for all schools to close in all parts of a country at once, despite the communication and administrative advantages of doing so\u2022What should be the trigger for proactive closures?\n\u2022The first case or outbreak involving the pandemic strain confirmed in a child or teacher\u2022Outbreaks in neighbouring or nearby schools\u2022What should be the trigger for reopening?

However, although we discuss key conclusions and findings of pandemic models, it is not our intention to do a detailed review of the subject (Halloran and colleagues28 review the findings of three models). In short, some models suggest that school closure combined with keeping all children at home might be sufficient to stop a pandemic,6 whereas others found a marginal effect on epidemic size but a substantial reduction of peak incidence.10 Those differences in model outputs are because of differences in modelling assumptions. For example, if it is assumed that 50% of transmissions occur in schools, a conclusion will follow that closure of schools will have an important effect on spread, especially if children can be kept apart outside of school. By contrast, if only 20% of transmissions happen in schools, a much smaller effect of closures is expected. Whether the 20% or 50% scenario is the most likely cannot be determined a priori (and this might vary between pandemics as well as between cultures or settings\u2014eg, urban vs rural). Modelling does not therefore provide primary evidence of the likely effect of school closure on transmission. Instead, it is necessary to carefully review what can be inferred from seasonal influenza epidemics and previous pandemics.",

A simplistic comparison of attack rates before and during school closure would conclude that the intervention had an important effect on spread. But in an influenza outbreak that has just peaked, such a reduction is expected even if there is no intervention. Figure 1 shows that the reduction after the peak in 2008 (when school closure was implemented) was essentially indistinguishable from that of 2007 (when schools remained open). Relying on the temporal pattern of the effective reproduction number (average number of people infected by a typical case) derived from sentinel surveillance data, Cowling and colleagues15 detected no significant effect of school closure on influenza spread in this outbreak.",

They found 22% reductions in weekly numbers of physician visits and emergency department visits and 43% reductions in weekly numbers of respiratory tract infection diagnoses and of viral infections. However, as shown in the Hong Kong example, simple comparison of attack rates can give misleading conclusions because of the intrinsically non-stationary dynamics of a seasonal epidemic. However, in the Israeli example, the strike ended while the influenza outbreak was ongoing, and respiratory illness visit rates rebounded, suggesting that the strike likely had an effect on spread. Further comparison with other years would be useful to assess the exact effect of school closure in this outbreak.",

Contact patterns during holidays might therefore be more distorted than would be seen during school closure alone. If schools are closed for a long period outside holidays, contact between children might increase in other settings. For example, children might mix more in their households and neighbourhoods. It is also possible that working parents would recreate school structures during a period of extended school closure (eg, one parent takes care of a group of children one day and another parent the next day, to reduce the effect of childcare needs on working patterns).",

In many industrialised countries, social programmes targeting underprivileged children rely on school facilities. For example, in 2004 in the USA, the national school lunch programme and the school breakfast programme delivered daily meals to 29\u00b70 million and 8\u00b79 million children, respectively; half of the lunches served were free and an additional 10% were served at a reduced price.20 Closing schools without preparation would interrupt those programmes, with adverse consequences for vulnerable children and families. In the American survey,21 25% of 664 adults who had major responsibility for children 17 years old or younger reported that a child in their household gets free breakfast or lunch at school or daycare. 34% of these 166 recipients of free meals said that not getting them during a 3-month closure would be a problem. Hence, in areas of the USA where schools have such extraeducational social functions, planning is being made to ensure the continuity of these services, and the term class dismissal is preferred to school closure (panel 1).",

Some studies have found that, despite children being poorly equipped to care for themselves, parents overestimate their child's ability to self-care.20 Children left in self-care, often from low-income households, suffer from more behavioural and social problems.20 Furthermore, studies of education performance show that declines after the long summer holidays are largest for children from poor and minority backgrounds.20 The same type of social inequality should be expected after prolonged school closure during a pandemic.",

One risk for such an approach is that local surveillance might be lacking in sensitivity or promptness, meaning schools are closed too late. False positives might also be an issue, given surveillance of influenza-like illnesses will probably not be able to distinguish between pandemic influenza and other respiratory disease outbreaks. The second option is synchronised national (or, in larger countries, regional) closures that have the benefits of consistency and simplicity; they can rely on national surveillance systems that are expected to be more robust than local mechanisms. The health effect of national or regional closure is expected to be more substantial than that of local closure, but with a higher economic and social cost, since schools might be closed for longer and in areas with low local incidence.

Arguably, triggers based on virological identification of the first few hundred pandemic influenza cases identified in a country might be the most reliable, but as the H1N1 pandemic is demonstrating, seasonal variation in influenza transmission could mean that such a sensitive trigger might lead to schools being closed for months.

In the early stage of the H1N1 pandemic, the large proportion of children among cases so far,4, 5 and the large number of case clusters in schools strongly suggest that the reduction in the number of cases because of school closure in this specific pandemic will be stronger than would be expected from observations based on seasonal influenza.14\n",

This is illustrated by the recommendations that have been made by the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) which contrast with earlier recommendations.39, 40 On the basis of information that many cases in the Mexican epidemic had severe illness, the CDC initially recommended school closure as an option to lessen the risk of infection from a potentially severe disease. However, as estimates of severity were revised downward, recommendations were changed and the early identification and isolation of ill students and staff became the primary method to reduce the spread of influenza in schools.40 The use of stringent and costly measures such as school closure should indeed be based on age-specific estimates of severity and local morbidity indicators. It is important to emphasise again that the WHO phases are not an indication of severity (phase six only means that there is a sustained spread of the virus in different continents); WHO now makes parallel statements on severity and geographical spread.41, 42\n",

However, if the interventions target the same place or group of individuals, then the combined effect might be smaller than the sum of the individual impacts. For example, if children are vaccinated, the additional benefits gained by closing schools might be very small. These complexities mean that predicting the effect of combined interventions is challenging, and modelling has an important role in assessing likely impact.

Outbreaks that are investigated are usually atypical, in the sense that they are expected to be larger than an average school outbreak. Caution is therefore necessary when extrapolating from those outbreaks to nationwide estimates. For this reason, a meta-analysis will be particularly useful.\u2022As part of the same studies, the economic and social impact of the closure on households should be established. Linking the epidemiological and economic components of household questionnaires will allow investigation of the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.\u2022Collecting data on activities and interactions with other children during school term and during school closure. So far, the absence of such data reduces our ability to assess the effect of school closure on influenza spread, namely we do not know how mixing patterns of children outside school are modified when schools close (so-called compensatory behaviours).\u2022Assessing the effect of school closure on transmission in the wider community (ie, not just children and their families). This will be more challenging since it will require collecting good incidence data at a geographical resolution that matches the catchment area of the schools. Such spatial resolution cannot be achieved with traditional surveillance networks, so non-conventional approaches (such as polls organised by phone or on the web) will have to be considered.\u2022There is also a need to refine our understanding of the implications of school closure for health-care and other essential services.
