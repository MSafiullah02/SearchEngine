However, although it protects newborns and children from severe forms of TB, its efficacy against pulmonary TB in adolescents and adults is far from optimal, with protection rates varying between 0 and 80 % according to the geographical area.",

At the heart of the T3SS is the type three secretion apparatus (T3SA) which is composed of a basal body similar to that of flagellar systems and an extracellular needle [28]. Invasion plasmid antigen D (IpaD) is a 37 kDa protein that forms a pentameric ring at the tip of the needle. It controls secretion of effector proteins and is the environmental sensor for mobilization of IpaB to the T3SA tip complex. IpaB is a 64 kDa translocator that forms a ring atop the IpaD ring and is responsible for host cell contact. This contact is required for mobilization of IpaC to the needle tip and formation of a complete unidirectional conduit from the bacterial cytoplasm to the host cell cytoplasm. The initiation of inflammation and invasion processes occurs exclusively at the basolateral side of host cells, highlighting the importance of the previous steps of macrophage subversion in Shigella colonization of the gut.",

However, several animal models have been developed to study the pathogenesis of Shigella, the resulting immune response against Shigella antigens, and the protection efficacy of candidate vaccines against shigellosis:\nMouse lethal pulmonary challenge: Many of the recent vaccine development efforts have been tested in the mouse lethal pulmonary model. In this model, a high dose of virulent Shigella is administered to mice intranasally.\nMouse colonic infection: Another mouse model more recently developed involves the use of streptomycin to clear the intestinal commensal bacteria. After such treatment, Shigella is able to colonize the colon with viable Shigella being isolated from fecal samples for up to 30 days [29].\nSereny test: The Sereny test model [30] has long been used to test the invasive capabilities of Shigella. In this model, guinea pigs are inoculated in the eye with Shigella, which induces a keratoconjunctivitis. This model allows examination of Shigella invasion and the protective efficacy of candidate vaccines.\nRabbit cecal ligation model: In this model, diarrhea is used as an indicator of infection and disease. Although this model can be used to characterize the interactions of Shigella and the intestinal mucosa at the natural site of infection, it has the difficulty that is introduced by surgery in laboratory animals [31].\nNonhuman primate (NHP) models: NHP models have been used to define the ability of vaccines to elicit immune responses and protection (rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys) [32]. The main advantage of this model is that Shigella is able to colonize the large intestine and generate symptoms that these bacteria generate in human infection.\n",

Administration of LPS or O antigen alone in animal models is not enough to elicit immune responses, making them ineffective immunogens. To solve this limitation, these molecules have been used in conjunction with different proteins as carriers. Several variants of LPS/O-antigen mixtures have been developed and characterized. One of these protein combination approaches uses S. flexneri and S. sonnei LPS complexed with Neisseria meningitidis outer membrane protein proteosomes [33, 34]. LPS is extracted from S. flexneri or S. sonnei by hot phenol extraction and mixed with detergent-extracted outer membrane proteins from N. meningitidis. The complex was then separated from free LPS present in the mixture by gel filtration chromatography. The concept behind this vaccine is that the proteins present in the N. meningitidis proteosome are able to act as carriers for T cell stimulation, thus allowing the recognition of LPS.\n",

While the degree of resistance may vary between different tick and host species, evidence strongly suggests that natural resistance against tick infestation develops based on adaptive immune response mechanisms [47]. Ticks feeding from hosts vaccinated with tick components take up effector molecules during feeding that mediate deleterious effects on the ticks. This effect manifests as reduction of feeding time, tick mortality (during or after feeding), reduced engorgement weights, and reduced reproductive capacity of adult females. Eggs laid from ticks fed on vaccinated hosts may also show reduced hatching rates. The overall result culminates in reduction of tick populations and tick-borne diseases.",

They extend protrusions between epithelial cells, enabling direct sampling of luminal antigens [69]. Through upregulation of MHC and co-stimulatory molecules, matured DCs convert into highly efficient antigen-presenting cells. Successful antigen presentation to CD4+ T cells requires recognition of cognate peptide in the context of MHC class II molecules, whereas epitopes presented on MHC class I molecules stimulate Ag-specific CD8+ T cells. When antigen uptake occurs, these DCs change their phenotype by expressing higher levels of co-stimulatory molecules and move to T cell areas of inductive sites for antigen presentation. Thus, DCs and their derived cytokines play key roles in the induction of antigen-specific effector Th cell responses. In this regard, targeting mucosal DCs is an effective strategy to induce mucosal and systemic immune responses.\n",

It has also been shown that immature DCs efficiently capture Lactobacillus species, and these bacteria activated human DCs, resulting in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-12, increased proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+ cells, and skewed T cell response toward a Th1 pathway believed to be involved in effective clearance of microbial pathogens [72, 73] (Fig. 9.23).\n",

ORF1 encodes a polyprotein that is processed by viral protease 3CLpro into the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and approximately five other nonstructural proteins including p48, the nucleoside triphosphatase, p22, VPg, and 3CLpro. The two structural proteins, the major (VP1) and minor (VP2) capsid proteins, are encoded by ORF2 and ORF3, respectively [84]. Structural analysis of NoV has revealed that each viral capsid is composed of 90 dimers of VP1 in a T = 3 icosahedral symmetry. VP1 folds into two domains: a shell (S) domain that is responsible for initiating capsid assembly and icosahedral contacts and a protruding domain (P), containing two subdomains of P1 and P2, that enhance the stability of the capsid by providing intermolecular contacts between VP1 dimers.

A multivalent approach employs a combination of amino-terminal protein fragments representing different M types and is designed to target prevalent GAS strains in a population. Using this approach, a recombinant multivalent GAS vaccine containing M protein peptides from 26 different GAS serotypes prevalent in North America was demonstrated to evoke opsonic antibodies in animals [102]. From epidemiological data, the 26-valent vaccine would cover the majority of pharyngitis and invasive GAS diseases, including RF, invasive fasciitis, and toxic shock syndrome. Recently, a new 30-valent GAS vaccine was shown to be immunogenic in rabbits and evoked opsonic antibodies against \u201cnon-vaccine\u201d serotypes [103] potentially creating a vaccine with much broader coverage. This type of vaccine is population specific and therefore may not be effective universally. It may also need to be re-designed periodically to reflect changes in the epidemiology of GAS infections.\nJ8 vaccine. A GAS vaccine that employs peptide epitopes from the conserved C-repeat region of the M protein is the second approach and has the potential in theory for greater coverage of M types. Immunization of mice with a C-region peptide GAS vaccine candidate called J8 conjugated to the carrier protein diphtheria toxoid (dT) and co-delivery with an appropriate adjuvant led to protection against systemic and mucosal GAS infection [104] (Fig. 9.29).J8 also elicited protective immunity against GAS when linked to lipopeptides [105, 106]. Other studies have shown that intranasal immunization of mice with C-region peptides conjugated to the experimental mucosal adjuvant cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) evoked protective immunity against GAS at the mucosal level [107]. CTB could possibly enter olfactory regions of the central nervous system and cause neuronal damage following intranasal delivery [108] and therefore is not suitable for human use. Vector delivery approaches have included expressing the C-repeat region on vaccinia virus [109], the commensal bacterium Lactococcus lactis [110], or Streptococcus gordonii [111] .\n\nJ14. The third combination vaccine approach uses both serotypic and conserved M protein peptide epitopes. Initially, a heteropolymer GAS vaccine construct was synthesized by free radical-induced polymerization of acryloyl peptides to combine seven serotypic epitopes and a highly conserved C-region peptide epitope called J14 [112]. The M types that were targeted in the heteropolymer represented GAS infections prevalent in the Northern Territory of Australia \u2013 a region highly endemic for GAS. Immunization of mice with the heteropolymer demonstrated excellent immunogenicity and protection against homologous and heterologous GAS strains, indicating its potential to provide broad coverage.\n\n",

Epitope mapping studies were used to identify the conserved GAS vaccine candidate J8, which contains a conformational protective B cell epitope and was designed to lack a human heart cross-reactive T cell epitope [115, 116].",

GAS that breaches the physical barrier of the mucosal epithelium of the nasal-associated lymphoid tissue, functionally analogous to human tonsils, is purported to be transported to the underlying lymphoid tissue via association with membranous (M) cells. Cells of the innate immune system sense GAS and produce cytokines and chemokines to contain the infection to the mucosa. GAS antigens are delivered to antigen-presenting cells such as DCs and B cells. IgA-committed B cells are activated and initiate antigen-specific IgA responses. DCs play a fundamental role in the development of immunity to GAS and present antigen to T cells to induce a Th17 response that is integral along with IgA for mucosal defense against pharyngeal GAS colonization. Mucosal vaccination is designed to mimic these responses and effectively clear GAS from the mucosal surface upon infection to prevent GAS colonization and carriage. GAS that escapes the host\u2019s defense mechanisms can disseminate into the lymphatics and blood, leading to systemic infection. Mucosal vaccination is also able to induce a systemic immune response characterized by the induction of opsonic IgG antibodies, which destroy the pathogen by opsonophagocytosis.

Only a small portion of pDNA will cross the cell membrane and faces exo- and endonuclease. But a small portion is tagged with NLS (nuclear localization sequence). This NLS decoration is recognized by importin that transport the DNA cargo from the cytoplasm through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) into the nucleus. Only molecules smaller than 39 nm can pass. Once inside the nucleus, interaction with Ran-GTP causes a conformational change in the importin, resulting in the dissociation from its cargo.
