Positive-screened patients should undergo testing when available or undergo 14-d preoperative quarantine. If testing remains unavailable, enhanced personal protective equipment (PPE) (Table 1) precautions should be considered.6 In institutions without routine testing availability and without high rates of disease presence, those patients who screen negative may likely proceed to the operating room with standard precautionary measures.",
