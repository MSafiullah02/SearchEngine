This is expressed as \u201ctime until last apnea episode\u201d in our trial registration. An earlier proposed outcome, length of stay in the PICU, was changed before the start of study enrollment because it can be dependent on social factors and bed availability, unlike time until last apnea episode, which is measured objectively. Patients with a major protocol violation, such as receipt of caffeine in the placebo group or receipt of a second dose, were excluded in this proof-of-concept efficacy trial. Secondary outcomes were the frequency and duration of apnea in the first 24, 48, and 72 hours after study drug administration; invasive and noninvasive respiratory support administered; duration of oxygen therapy; time until feeding was tolerated; length of PICU/step-down unit stay; and overall length of hospital stay. As a safety measure, spot heart rate was compared every 4 hours from enrollment for up to 3 days.",

A total of 87 patients who had not received caffeine were identified, of whom 52 (60%) were apnea-free at 12 hours after admission. We extrapolated these results to 24 hours because we did not have data for the proportion apnea-free at 24 hours. To enable detection of a 50% relative improvement (to 90%) in resolution of apnea with 90% power and 2-sided \u03b1 value of 0.05, we estimated that 42 patients per group were required. To compensate for dropouts, we planned to recruit a total of 90 patients. However, the accuracy of this estimate is compromised because we used a dichotomous outcome for the calculation and the continuous outcome described above for our actual study outcome.",

Our power to find a significant difference in the time from the end of study drug infusion to a 24-hour apnea-free period was limited because our sample size was calculated based on a retrospective survey in which a 12-hour rather than a 24-hour apnea-free period was used because the time to a 24-hour apnea-free period after admission was unknown. Moreover, our sample size estimate was based on a dichotomous outcome, apnea-free or not at 24 hours, whereas in this clinical trial we used a continuous outcome, time from the end of study drug infusion to a 24-hour apnea-free period. Although we found no benefit from caffeine, our sample size estimation method might have led to a study underpowered to identify any possible measurable benefit. Thus, a larger sample size might have shown a more pronounced difference between treatment groups in time to achieve the 24-hour apnea-free outcome.",

Nonetheless, our post hoc subgroup analysis did not show any superiority of caffeine in younger infants, in whom the expected half-life of caffeine is 72-96 hours.28 Our randomization did not yield entirely similar groups, with a shorter duration of symptoms before presentation, and thus possibly more severe apnea syndromes, in the group treated with caffeine. Finally, 30% of the patients in each study arm required high-flow oxygen, which may provide nearly similar support as continuous positive airway pressure32 and might have masked further apnea attacks in these patients.",
