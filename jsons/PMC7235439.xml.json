Proteases are one of the most important non-structural proteins within the viral replication cycle. They are utilized to produce both functional and structural proteins. Papain-like cysteine protease (PLP2pro) and chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro25-30 also called Mpro) are the main proteases in SARS-CoV (Mukherjee et al. 2011). Interestingly, papain-like cysteine protease can damper the antiviral response of host cells (Lindner et al. 2005; Niemeyer et al. 2018). Helicase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase are the other crucial non-structural proteins that are encoded by coronaviruses genome (Zumla et al. 2016). The high similarity between the main proteins of SARS-CoV and COVID-19 (Zhou et al. 2020), 79.5% sequence similarity (He et al. 2020), suggests drug designed against these proteins in SARS-CoV (Mukherjee et al. 2011) could be effective against COVID-19, too.",

However, no specific anti-COVID-19 treatments are recommended because of the absence of evidence (Beware of Fraudulent Coronavirus Tests, Vaccines and Treatments 2020; Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) 2020; Information for Clinicians on Therapeutic Options for COVID-19 Patients 2020). Given the urgency of the 2019-nCoV outbreak, researchers pay particular attention to the repositioning of existing antiviral agents that are approved or in development against infections caused by human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and influenza (Li and De Clercq 2020). Besides, since most coronaviruses especially MERS, SARS, and COVID-19 have a similar viral structure, a similar infection pathway, and a similar structure of the S proteins, similar research strategies should be used for the COVID-19 (Yu et al. 2020).",

Blood gas analysis and timely re-examination of chest imaging should be performed when necessary (Shen et al. 2020). Nearly all patients accept oxygen therapy, and the WHO recommends extracorporeal membrane oxygenation to patients with refractory hypoxemia (Guo et al. 2020). Nitric oxide inhalation (Chen et al. 2004) and epoprostenol inhalation, a prostacyclin with vasodilator properties (Alessandri et al. 2018; Searcy et al. 2015), are the other recommended options to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome.

These include remdesivir, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin, tocilizumab, and lopinavir/ritonavir (Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Epidemiology, virology, clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention 2020). In March 2020, the WHO started a global mega trial of the four most promising coronavirus treatments in 10 countries called \u201cSolidarity\u201d in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon beta are the experimental therapy currently being researched under this Solidarity Trial (WHO launches global megatrial of the four most promising coronavirus treatments 2020).",

Wu et al. (2004) reported that niclosamide was able to inhibit SARS-CoV replication and eliminate viral antigen synthesis (Wu et al. 2004). This drug stimulates autophagy in MERS-CoV and reduces viral replication (Gassen et al. 2019). Nitazoxanide is the other antiparasitic drug that has been FDA-approved for treating Cryptosporidium and Giardia. Some studies have mentioned its broad-spectrum antiviral activity (Rossignol 2014). This drug has been suggested as an effective therapy against coronaviruses (Cao et al. 2015). Also, it has been a candidate as a new drug for the treatment of MERS (Rossignol 2016). In cells that are infected by foreign RNA, nitazoxanide amplifies host innate immune antiviral responses by triggering foreign cytoplasmic RNA sensing and the type 1 interferon axis (Jasenosky et al. 2019). In this respect, nitazoxanide may have potential against COVID-19 (Adnan Shereen et al. 2020).

This enzyme is the target of some antiviral drugs. Sofosbuvir and ribavirin are nucleotide derivatives. They inhibit RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and are used for HCV therapy. IDX-184 is another RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that is under clinical trials for HCV therapy. An in silico study proved the efficacy of remdesivir against COVID-19 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Elfiky 2020). Remdesivir is a novel antiviral prodrug that has been developed against the Ebola virus not only for treatment but also for prophylaxis post-exposure. It showed a broad-spectrum antiviral activity in vitro against filoviruses, arenaviruses, and coronaviruses. Remdesivir has not been approved or licensed at the time of writing this article (Warren et al. 2016). Remdesivir is metabolized into an adenosine nucleotide analog that interferes with the action of virus RNA polymerase post entry. It seems to have good inhibitory effects against COVID-19 at the cellular level (Guo et al. 2020). In a case report, remdesivir was started intravenously on day 7 in a patient with COVID-19 with no side effects (Holshue et al. 2020). Nausea, vomiting, prolonged prothrombin time, and raise of the liver enzymes have been reported with remdesivir consumption (Remdesivir (United States: Investigational agent; refer to Prescribing and Access Restrictions): Drug information 2020).",

            "text": "Although the use of antibiotics, especially broad-spectrum types, should be avoided in patients with COVID-19, in these patients with a bacterial infection, the use of antibacterial agents is recommended (Jin et al. 2020). Proposed antimicrobial agents against community-acquired pneumonia are amoxicillin, azithromycin, or fluoroquinolones. In severe patients, all possible pathogens should be covered by empirical antibacterial treatment until the pathogenic bacteria are clarified [43]. Moxifloxacin is the best recommendation for covering mycoplasma and chlamydia (Zhang et al. 2020b). Azithromycin, a macrolide, is the best-proposed antimicrobial that has been added to the hydroxychloroquine regimen COVID-19 and induced a synergic effect on virus elimination. This combination therapy (azithromycin 500 mg on day 1 followed by 250 mg per day, the next 4 days and hydroxychloroquine sulfate 200 mg, three times per day during 10 days) reduced the number of viral carriages and viral carrying duration (Gautret et al. 2020). Azithromycin is an antibiotic from the macrolide group that has anti-inflammatory effects (Amsden 2005; Beigelman et al. 2009; Iveti\u0107 Tkal\u010devi\u0107 et al. 2006). Furthermore, it has antiviral (Iannetta et al. 2017; Menzel et al. 2016; Schoegler et al. 2014; Sch\u00f6gler et al. 2014) properties. This may be a reason why adding this drug to hydroxychloroquine improved the clearance of COVID-19. In this regard, there is a need to test azithromycin as first-line therapy for COVID-19. It should be considered that both chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (Silva et al. 2007) and azithromycin (Hancox et al. 2013) are known to prolong QTc-interval. So this combination therapy may increase the risk of cardiac side effects.",

Human cells expressing ACE2 are more susceptible to be infected with COVID-19 (Guo et al. 2020; Shanmugaraj et al. 2020). So, specific neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against host cell ACE2 receptors or virus receptor-binding domain in spike protein interfere with virus attachment and entry. Some monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV have been proposed that due to similarity with COVID-19 could be useful against this virus, too. Some of them neutralize S1 fragment and block the interaction of S1 subunit protein with cellular receptor ACE2, including 80R, CR3014, CR3022, F26G18, F26G19, m396, and 201. 1A9 monoclonal antibody binds to the S2 fragment of SARS-CoV and blocks the interaction of the S2 subunit protein with the cellular receptor. S230 binds to RBD and blocks the interaction of S1 subunit protein with cellular ACE2 receptor. 4D4 and 68 are the other proposed neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV (Shanmugaraj et al. 2020). While CR3022 neutralizing antibody binds potently to both SARA-CoV and COVID-19 spike protein, some of these neutralizing antibodies including m396 and CR3014 that showed potent inhibitory against SARA-CoV spike protein does not bind to COVID-19 spike protein probably due to differences in the RBD of these tow viruses. CR3022 has a worth of potential therapy against COVID-19 (Tian et al. 2020).",

Ap2-associated protein kinase 1 is one of the main promoters of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and its inhibition may disrupt the penetration of the virus into the cells and assembly of its particles. The Janus kinase (JAK) is the other regulator of the passage of the virus into the lung cells. It has been proposed that baricitinib (2 or 4 mg once a day) by inhibition of these kinases may be useful in COVID-19 acute respiratory disease. This drug in one way blocks the virus entry and in the other way inhibits cytokine release and inflammation by inhibiting JAK1/2 (JAK-STAT signaling) (Richardson et al. 2020). Tofacitinib, baricitinib, fedratinib, and ruxolitinib all are JAK-STAT signaling inhibitors and have anti-inflammatory effects; however, baricitinib is better than fedratinib and ruxolitinib due to its high affinity for Ap2-associated protein kinase 1, once-daily dosing, and acceptable side effects. It has low protein-binding properties and has no interaction with CYP drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters that cause good potential for combining therapy with baricitinib COVID-19 (Richardson et al. 2020).",

PARP1 activation enhances inflammation by activation of proinflammatory cytokines, inducible nitric oxide synthase, intracellular adhesion molecule 1, cyclooxygenase 2, and NADPH oxidase as well as major histocompatibility complex class II. It promotes cytokine storm by activation of NF-kB-mediated proinflammatory signals and activation of AP-1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and downstream cytokines and chemokines pathways. PARP1 activation results in cellular energy failure, necrosis, and cell death (Zingarelli et al. 2004). PARP1 inhibitors suppress viral replication and inhibit the ADP-ribosylation of viral core proteins, suppress the binding of nucleocapsid protein to viral RNA, and interfere with the structure packaging of the viral genome (Liu et al. 2015). Furthermore, PARP1 inhibitors reduce energy failure and suppress NAD+/ATP depletion (Larmonier et al. 2016). According to the aforementioned data, PARP1 inhibitors including CVL218 that binds to the N-terminal domain of nucleocapsid protein of COVID-19 might be a worthy candidate for treating infected people with this virus (Ge et al. 2020).",

Although corticosteroid treatment could have a role in suppressing lung inflammation, it was associated with an interruption in the clearance of viral RNA from respiratory tract secretions and had no positive impact on the decrease of mortality rate in critically ill patients (Russell et al. 2020). Corticosteroid therapy is accompanied by neutrophilic leukocytosis, eosinopenia, and a decrease in peripheral blood lymphocytic count especially in T cells (Coutinho and Chapman 2011). According to the published articles in the 1990s, the administration of corticosteroids induces a transient lymphocytopenia that peaks after 4\u20136 h and returns to the normal level after 24\u201348 h. This duration depends on the potency and dose of the administrated corticosteroids (Fauci and Dale 1974; Webel et al. 1974; Yu et al. 1974). Recently, it has been proven that corticosteroid therapy induces immunosuppression predominantly by suppression of cell-mediated immunity and a minimal inhibitory effect on humoral immunity. In T cell subsets, CD4+ is more susceptible than CD8+ (Baris et al. 2016). The viral diseases may get wild in the immunocompromised state (Rouse and Sehrawat 2010) and the body cannot fight against COVID-19.",

In March 2020, the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen as an antipyretic drug in COVID-19 has been warned and acetaminophen has been recommended. There was a report that in 4 young patients with COVID-19 and no underlying health problem, the use of ibuprofen worsened the COVID-19 symptoms. It has been speculated that its anti-inflammatory properties could damp down the immune system and prolong viral shedding (Day 2020). It may reduce inflammation and fever in patients with COVID-19 and diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections. Long-term use of ibuprofen may cause gastrointestinal bleeding, fluid retention, and renal dysfunction even at therapeutic doses. In toxic doses, it may result in respiratory depression, hypotension or shock, depressed mental status, severe metabolic acidosis, severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage, life-threatening electrolyte imbalances, or arrhythmias (Ershad and Vearrier 2019).",

At present, no specific antiviral therapy has been approved for the treatment of COVID-19. In this urgent, the researchers are trying to the repositioning of existing drugs against COVID-19. Old drugs that may be effective are from different pharmacological categories, including antimalarials, anthelmintics, anti-protozoal, anti-HIVs, anti-influenza, anti-hepacivirus, antineoplastics, neutralizing antibodies, immunoglobulins, and interferons. Some of them focus on the SARS-CoV2 fusion/entry process either by inhibition of S1-mediated virus attachment or by blocking of S2-mediated virus\u2013cell membrane fusion, and some of them interfere with viral replication. These proposed agents fight with the virus by modulating host immune response, neutralizing inflammatory cytokines, or inducing passive immunity. Convalescent plasma seems the best therapy until now in patients with COVID-19. Newly introduced agents focus mainly on the host cell ACE2 receptors and S receptors on the virus (Table 2, Fig. 1).",

It is a proinflammatory peptide, a potent endothelium-dependent vasodilator, and a smooth muscle contractor in the bronchus. In severe cases, it may result in angioedema (Joseph and Kaplan 2005). Previously, it has been reported that the bradykinin B(2) receptor antagonist, MEN1632, and the inhibitor of tissue kallikrein, VA999024, attenuated the response to parainfluenza-3 virus\u2013induced inflammation and airway hyperactivity (Broadley et al. 2010).
