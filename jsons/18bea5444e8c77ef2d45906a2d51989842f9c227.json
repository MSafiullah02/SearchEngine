Unfortunately, antiviral drugs to treat enterovirus infections have not been approved yet. Over the past decades, several direct-acting inhibitors have been developed, including capsid binders, which block virus entry, and inhibitors of viral enzymes required for genome replication. Capsid binders and protease inhibitors have been clinically evaluated, but failed due to limited efficacy or toxicity issues. As an alternative approach, host-targeting inhibitors with potential broad-spectrum activity have been identified. Furthermore, drug repurposing screens have recently uncovered promising new inhibitors with disparate viral and host targets. Together, these findings raise hope for the development of (broad-range) anti-enteroviral drugs.",

The genus Enterovirus, which is by far the largest genus, comprises many human pathogens, including poliovirus, coxsackie A and B viruses, echoviruses, numbered enteroviruses (e.g., EV-A71 and EV-D68), and rhinoviruses. Infections with nonpolio enteroviruses can result in a wide variety of symptoms, including hand-foot-and-mouth disease, conjunctivitis, aseptic meningitis, severe neonatal sepsis-like disease, and acute flaccid paralysis, whereas infections with rhinoviruses cause the common cold as well as exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (reviewed in Ref. [1] ). Vaccines are only available against poliovirus and EV-A71. Development of vaccines against all enteroviruses seems unfeasible, given the large number of (sero)types (i.e., >100 nonpolio enteroviruses and >150 rhinoviruses). Hence, there is a great need for (broad-acting) antivirals against enteroviruses. Here, we will review recent efforts to develop direct-acting antivirals as well as host factor-targeting inhibitors to treat enterovirus infections (Table 1) .",

The enterovirus replication cycle ( Figure 1b) is initiated by binding of a virion to its receptor. Most enterovirus receptors are protein receptors that belong to the Ig superfamily or the integrin receptor family (reviewed in Ref. [2] ). The receptors usually bind in the 'canyon', a depression in the virion surface around the five-fold axes of symmetry [2] . Receptor-binding induces virion destabilization and release of the 'pocket factor', a fatty acid located in a hydrophobic pocket beneath the canyon, to initiate virion uncoating [2] .",

            "text": "So-called 'capsid binders' are the most extensively studied class of anti-enteroviral compounds [3, 4] . These compounds replace the pocket factor in the canyon and thereby block virion uncoating. Clinical trials for the capsid binders pleconaril, vapendavir (a.k.a. BTA798), and pocapavir (a.k.a. V-073) are currently in progress or have recently been completed, the status of which has been described last year [5] . Since then, another trial with pleconaril was conducted for the treatment of neonates with enterovirus sepsis, which showed greater survival among pleconaril recipients [6] . A major drawback of capsid binders is the rapid emergence of resistance. Indeed, in a clinical trial for the treatment of rhinovirus infections with pleconaril, compound-resistant viruses were isolated [7] . In addition, naturally occurring pleconaril-resistant viruses (e.g., an echovirus 11 strain) have been reported [8] . These resistance issues may complicate the application of capsid binders in the clinic. The enterovirus life cycle begins with the attachment of the virus particle to a cellular receptor followed by the internalization of the particle into the host cell. The genome is released and directly Many capsid binders are active against rhinovirus A and B species members [3] , but not against members of the rhinovirus C species [9, 10] . The recent elucidation of the atomic virion structure of rhinovirus-C15 by cryo-EM revealed a unique 'spiky' structure, vastly different from other enterovirus species. Furthermore, the hydrophobic pocket is filled with bulky hydrophobic residues, thereby not providing sufficient space for a pocket factor or a capsid binder. These features likely explain why rhinovirus C species are not responsive to pocket-binding compounds [11 ] .",

Although the results of rhinovirus challenge trials were promising [24] , rupintrivir did not reduce disease severity in naturally infected patients [25] , hence the clinical development was halted. However, many rupintrivir derivatives are currently under development [26] [27] [28] . Furthermore, non-peptidomimetic small molecule inhibitors are developed to circumvent difficulties with bioavailability [29] , but they have yet to be evaluated in clinical trials.",

Besides incorporation into nascent viral RNA, gemcitabine has been suggested to block access of nucleotides into the active side of the polymerase. Furthermore, gemcitabine blocks viral genome replication by inhibiting ribonucleotide reductase, the cellular enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of deoxyribonucleotides to ribonucleotides [35] .

GPC-N114 was identified as a novel broad-range enterovirus inhibitor that targets the RNA template-primer site in the core of 3D pol , making it the first anti-enteroviral compound with this mechanism of action [37 ] . Unfortunately, the efficacy of GPC-N114 in animal models remains to be tested due to problems with formulating the compound for in vivo use. Alternative strategies for 3D pol inhibition, although thus far unexplored, may be to interfere with posttranslational modifications of 3D pol like sumoylation and ubiquitination, both of which are important for 3D pol activity [38] .",

The formation of enterovirus ROs is mediated by the concerted actions of viral proteins 2B, 2C, and 3A, as well as a selected set of hijacked host factors (recently reviewed in Ref. [52] ). One of these pivotal host factors is phosphatidylinositol 4kinase type IIIb (PI4KB) [52] [53] [54] . It is recruited to membranes by the viral protein 3A and enriches ROs in phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) lipids, which is essential for genomic RNA replication [53 ] . As PI4KB is essential for all enteroviruses, inhibitors of this enzyme (e.g., PIK93, GW5074, T-00127-HEV1 and BF738735) (reviewed in Ref. [5] ) have broad-spectrum activity [53 ,54-56] . However, some PI4KB inhibitors showed lethal toxicity in mice and affected lymphocyte function in vitro, which has stalled the development of PI4KB inhibitors [57] . Besides the fact that PI4KB inhibitors may be toxic, their activity may also be overcome by some mutations in the viral 3A, as recently published [58, 59] .",

In line with this, cyclophilin A inhibitors HL05100P2 and cyclosporine A block EV-A71 replication [67 ] . Cyclophilins facilitate protein folding by catalyzing peptide bond isomerization and also play a role in the replication of other +RNA viruses, including HCV and coronaviruses (reviewed in Ref. [68] Capsid binders are currently most advanced in clinical trials, but the inherent problem of rapid resistance development raises concerns. The development of protease inhibitors requires the synthesis of relatively complex peptidomimetic molecules. 2C ATPase and 3D pol may be more promising targets for direct-acting antiviral drugs as they can be inhibited by small molecules, and several inhibitors of these factors were found to have broad-range anti-enteroviral activity. Other targets for broad-spectrum antiviral drugs are host factors, as many host factors are shared by enteroviruses, but a possible downside is the chance of adverse effects and toxicity, as exemplified by PI4KB inhibitors. Lately, several enterovirus inhibitors have been discovered in drug repurposing screens. These compounds are already available or at least quite advanced in (pre-)clinical development for their respective conditions, thus shortening the development process. Importantly, several of those inhibitors have broad-range, sometimes even pan-enterovirus activity.",

In the case of enterovirus infections, one may pharmaceutically disrupt essential interactions between viral proteins and host factors, which likely hampers virus replication without causing the overt toxicity issues that may be associated with inhibition of host proteins. Unfortunately, most protein-protein interactions cannot be addressed by current drug formats, including small molecules. The recent development of small cell-permeating, synthetic protein scaffolds (e.g., Alphabodies) may potentially lead to a novel approach to target protein-protein interactions in (entero)virus-infected cells [70] .",

Because cyclophilin inhibitors like cyclosporine A have an immunosuppressive effect, non-immunosuppressive inhibitors (e.g., NIM-811[69]) were developed and are currently in clinical trials for antiviral activity (e.g., alisporivir, a.k.a. Debio025, for HCV treatment). It remains to be established whether uncoating of other enteroviruses also relies on cyclophilins. Hence, the spectrum of antienteroviral activity of cyclophilin inhibitors remains to be explored.Currently, there are no antiviral drugs available for the treatment of enterovirus infections, while several potent antivirals are available against HCV, a +RNA virus with a similar replication strategy. Possibly, the small market for anti-enteroviral drugs impedes extensive (industrial) efforts to develop enterovirus inhibitors. Yet, antiviral drugs are urgently needed as enterovirus infections can be life-threatening especially in young children. Furthermore, antiviral drugs are expected to play a crucial role in poliovirus eradication and the post-eradication era.",
