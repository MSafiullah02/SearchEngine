On the other hand, antibiotic resistance can be defined as the ability of any microorganism to withstand the effects of an antibiotic, which is a specific type of drug resistance and evolves naturally via natural selection through random mutation [1, 2] . The antibiotic action is an environmental pressure; those bacteria that have a mutation allowing them to survive will live on to reproduce. They will then pass this trait to their offspring, which will be a fully resistant generation [3, 4] . Without doubt, antibiotic resistance is a global issue. Because of cross-continental travel of both humans and goods, antibiotic-resistant bacteria are spread from one country to another. Therefore, antibiotic resistance has been called one of the world's most pressing public health problems.",

Paradoxically, underuse through lack of access, inadequate dosing, poor adherence, and substandard antimicrobials may play as an important role as overuse [5, 6] . Since misuse of antibiotics jeopardizes the usefulness of essential drugs, decreasing inappropriate antibiotic use is the ideal way to control resistance [7] . Natural selection of penicillin-resistant strains in a bacterium known as Staphylococcus aureus began soon after penicillin was introduced in the 1940s. Recently more hospital-acquired infections are becoming resistant to the most powerful antibiotics available, such as vancomycin, which emerged in the United States in 2002, presenting physicians and patients with a serious problem [8] . A number of cases of community-associated methycillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) have also been reported, including cases in patients without established risk factors [9] .",

The results were evaluated by comparing the inhibition zones of the compounds, namely, furospinulosin-1, furospongin-1, 2-(hexaprenylmethyl)-2-methylchromenol, heptaprenyl-p-quinol, 12-epi-deoxoscalarin, 1,4,44-trihydroxy-2-octa-prenylbenzene, demethylfurospongin-4, 4-hydroxy-3-octaprenylbenzoic acid, 4-hydroxy-3-tetraprenylacetic acid, and 11-\u03b2-acetoxy-12-en-16-one. We found that furospinulosin-1, furospongin-1, 2-(hexaprenylmethyl)-2-methylchromenol, and heptaprenyl-p-quinol did not exhibit any inhibition against those bacterium strains, whereas 12-epi-deoxoscalarin (1) exerted a weak activity against B. subtilis and S. aureus, causing inhibition zones of 12 and 11 mm in diameter, respectively (Fig. 1 ). Demethylfurospongin-4 (2), 4-hydroxy-3-tetraprenylacetic acid (3), and 11-\u03b2-acetoxy-12-en-16-one (4) were also active against Gram-positive bacteria (Fig. 1 ). Among them, 4-hydroxy-3-tetraprenylacetic acid (3) was the most effective causing 20 mm of inhibition zone (Fig. 1) . None of the compounds tested had an ability to inhibit E. coli. Owing to scarcity of the compounds, only one concentration (0.5 mg/disk) could be tested. In conclusion, we suggested that this assay should be better with higher yield, if repeated.",

As a consequence, SAR studies indicated that the optimum length of side chain in the compounds for antibacterial activity should be 5-15 carbon atoms, which is in accordance with our most effective compound, 4-hydroxy-3-tetraprenylacetic acid (3). Besides, it was reported that long-chain alcohols exert higher antimicrobial activity compared to the corresponding acids and aldehydes [15] . Similarly, a relationship between antibacterial activity and the structure of aliphatic alcohols was described, which suggested that maximum activity against S. aureus might be depend on the number of carbon atoms in hydrophobic chain. This should be less than 12, but as close to 12 as possible [16] . However, according to the study of Inoue et al., this finding did not support the anti-Stapylococcus effect of the aliphatic terpene alcohols, farnesol, nerolidol, and plaunotol, which may result from configuration of functional groups and double bonds that affected activity [17] . Therefore, in that study, it was concluded that anti-Stapylococcus activity depends not only on aliphatic side chains, but also on the configurations of functional groups and double bonds. Possibly, the difference observed in the antibacterial effect of our compounds might be due to this reason as well.",

In addition to their diverse biological activities, there is an increasing interest in flavonoids due to their anti-infective properties [18] . For instance, the flavonoids quercetin and kaempferol, as well as the flavonoid glycosides rutin and isoquercitrin, were reported to have antibacterial and antifungal activities [19] . Quercetin and kaempferol are known to be the most common flavonols present in many plants, and occur in different glycosidic forms. In many studies, they or their various glycosides have been proved to possess antimicrobial activity or, in other words, the antimicrobial activity of plant extracts (e.g., Rubus ulmifolius, Combretum erythrophyllum, Morus alba, Trollius chinensis, and propolis) has been attributed to quercetin and kaempferol [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . In one of our recent studies, we examined antimicrobial and antiviral activities of four flavonoid derivatives, namely, scandenone (5), tiliroside (6), quercetin-3,7-O-\u03b1-L-dirhamnoside (7), and kaempferol 3,7-O-\u03b1-Ldirhamnoside (8) as shown in Fig. 2 .

Moreover, it is evident that a structure-activity relationship exists between the various flavonoids and their antimicrobial activity in most cases. A large number of antimicrobial flavonoids have been reviewed brilliantly and their SARs discussed [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . The majority of antifungal flavonoids have been observed to have either isoflavonoid, flavan, or flavanone structures such as maackiain, mucronulatol, luteolin 7-(2 -sulfatoglucoside), etc., which is consistent with our data on flavonoids. Accordingly, the presence of a phenolic group in the flavonoid structure suggests that it is necessary for antimicrobial activity. Interestingly, increasing the number of hydroxyl, methoxyl, or glycosyl substituents resulted in the steady loss of antifungal effect of the flavonoids [33] . In the review of Bylka et al. [34] , it was suggested that the antibacterial effect towards Gram-negative bacteria is higher with flavones, while flavonoids containing two or three hydroxy groups in rings A and B are more active in inhibition of Gram-positive bacteria. However, in our study, all four flavonoid derivatives, ",

Recently, flavonoids have been investigated from the viewpoint of their antiviral effect, particularly against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the causative agent of acquired immonodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Among them, quercetin has been shown to be effective against divergent virus types by many researchers, which supports our data on quercetin-3,7-O\u03b1-L-dirhamnoside [26] . In one of the earliest studies, oral application of quercetin in mice was found to display a protective effect towards intraperitoneal encephalomyocarditis, Mengo M,L and Mengo M virus infections, but not against intracerebral challenge with Mengo M virus. It was not virucidal and did not interfere with Mengo virus replication in L cells [35] . The potentiative interaction of quercetin with murine \u03b1/\u03b2 interferon in mice against Mengo virus infection [36] was also proved. Moreover, quercetin was reported to greatly enhance the antiviral effect of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) that produces a dose-dependent inhibition of vesicular stomatitis virus, Encephalomyocarditis virus, and HSV type-1 replication in WISH cells [37] . In another study, the effect of different substituents of quercetin and luteolin on the ability to inhibit the HSV type-1 replication in RK-13 cells was studied [38] .",

Therefore, no SAR studies have been encountered by us on the antiviral or antimicrobial activities of these alkaloids. However, a quantitative SAR analysis performed on a number of diterpene alkaloids isolated from an Aconitum sp. indicated that biological activity of these alkaloids may be related to their toxicity rather than to a specific pharmacological action [40] . In a current study on 43 norditerpenoid alkaloids from Consolida, Delphinium, and Aconitum species against several tumor cell lines, lycoctonine and browniine were 312 I. Orhan et al. found to be active among those screened [41] . In contrast to this data, lycoctonine and 14-acetyl derivative of browniine in our study showed a lesser amount of cytotoxicity on MDBK and Vero cell lines at 64 \u00b5g/mL. Gonzales-Coloma et al. studied antifeedant activity and toxicity of some diterpene alkaloids (15-acetylcardiopetamine, cardiopetamine along with its amino alcohol, the \u03b2, \u03b3 unsaturated ketone, and the acetylated ketone derivatives) from Delphinium sp. on the insects Spodoptera littoralis and Leptinotarsa decemlineata [42] . Results of the study showed that the C13 and C15 hydroxy substituents are essential features of the active molecule, while the C11 benzoate group enhanced the biological effect on both insect species, where all of our alkaloids lacked those two substituents. In a taxonomic study done in 2002, lycoctonine-type alkaloids isolated from three Delphinium species were classified into three groups according to the degree of their toxicity: N-(methylsuccinyl)-anthranoyllycoctonine (MAL)-type with high toxicity, lycoctonine-type with moderate toxicity, and 7,8-methylene-dioxylycoctonine (MDL)-type with low toxicity [43] . In that paper, it was reported that the moiety attached to C14 is quite important for the toxicity of these alkaloids, which is also in accordance with our present data. Furthermore, other functionalities on these molecules are also notable in terms of toxicity. It was noticed that the tertiary nitrogen, anthranilic acid substitution, and C1 moiety affect the toxicity degree within those alkaloids. For instance, when the methylsuccinyl group is removed from MAL (which then converts to lycoctonine), lycoctonine becomes 93 times less toxic.",

In one study, antimicrobial, cytotoxic, and anti-HIV activities of 26 simple isoquinolines and 21 benzylisoquinolines were investigated. The results showed that a quaternary nitrogen atom of isoquinoline or dyhydroisoquinoline type may enhance the potency of antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity, whereas anti-HIV activity was higher with tetrahydroisoquinolines [58] . In the study of Cui et al., simple isoquinolines, 15 of which were of 1-benzylisoquinoline-type and 19 of which were of protoberberine-derivatives, were screened against Epstein-Barr virus early antigen (EBV-EA) activation induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), which is considered to be an indicator of antitumorpromoting activity. The study was carried out using Raji cells and all 1benzylisoquinolines and 11 of the protoberberines exerted higher inhibitory activity than \u03b2-carotene [59] . Regarding the structure-activity relationship, it was concluded that the inhibitory activity of 1-benzylisoquinolines increased as the number of hydroxyl groups on the aromatic ring increased and, additionally, the size of substituents at the C8 and C13, as well as type and position of the oxygenated substituents on A and D rings, influenced the virus inhibition. Moreover, derivatives of the isoquinoline skeleton attached with carboxamide moiety were declared to be the potent and selective inhibitors of human cytolamegavirus [60] .",

Among the 13-alkyl-substituted and the 13-unsubstituted protoberberinium salts, an increase in antibacterial activity was observed with the 13-ethyl-9-ethoxyl, the 13-ethyl, and the 13-methyl derivatives against S. aureus by eight-, four-, and twofold, respectively, over berberine, which suggested that steric effects played an noteworthy role in the antibacterial activity [61] . Additionally, replacement of methoxyl groups at the C2 and the C3 of ring A by a methylenedioxy group caused a boost in activity. In this report, it was stated that the quaternary nitrogen atom (such as in protoberberinium salts) an alkylsubstituent at C13, and a methylenedioxy function at C2 and C3 are required for enhanced antibacterial activity. In a study by Nakamoto et al., berberine was revealed to have a strong antifungal effect against C. albicans, C. tropicalis, and C. glabrata, respectively, which is in accordance with our data on berberine [62] . In a recent publication, a high occurrence of antibacterial activity in berberine was shown towards E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, P. fluorescens, S. aureus, Salmonella typhi, Enterococcus sp., and Serratia marcescens, showing a better activity than streptomycin at 50 \u00b5g/mL by paper disc diffusion method. Consequently, berberine was concluded to be responsible for the high antibacterial activity of Coscinium fenestratum [63] . However, we found that berberine was only active against K. pneumoniae and A. baumannii by microdilution method, which might result from the application of two different methods. In another former study, berberine obtained from Berberis heterophylla was tested against the ATCC strains of S. aureus, Enterecoccus faecalis, P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and C. albicans by agar diffusion method at 50, 100, and 200 \u00b5g/mL concentrations. The alkaloid was highly active against S. aureus at 100 and 200 \u00b5g/mL, whereas it did not possess any inhibitory effect against E. faecalis, P. aeruginosa, and E. coli [64] . This data was consistent with ours for berberine in the case of E. coli and P. aeruginosa. It was not active to S. aureus, which might again be the result of the use of two dissimilar methods. In the same work, antifungal activity screening was performed with berberine using the clinical strains of several Candida sp. such as C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. haemulonii, C. lusitaniae, C. krusei, and C. parapsilosis. Being the most active to C. krusei, followed by the rest in decreasing degrees of effectiveness, berberine was expressed as a novel antifungal agent.",

On the other hand, the complex nature of plant extracts and the high probability of competing or synergistic bioactivities within the same extract mean that these results represent the starting point for an activity-guided search for active plant metabolites. It is also evident that a structure-activity relationship exists between the various chemical structures and their antimicrobial activity in most cases. However, antiviral agents, unlike antibacterial drugs which may cover a wide range of pathogens, tend to be narrow in spectrum, and, unfortunately, have a limited efficacy. Historically, the discovery of antiviral drugs has been largely fortuitous. Spurred on by success with antibiotics, drug companies launched huge blind-screening programs with relatively little success. Besides, lead compounds were modified by scientists in an attempt to improve bioactivity. However, there is still a great need to develop more effective antiviral and antimicrobial drug molecules.",
