            "text": "Dendritic cells (DCs), which are present in the tissues of all organs as well as in the circulation and in lymphatic organs, are targets for infection by many different viruses. Viruses entering the body through epithelial surfaces or directly via the blood stream encounter DCs at early time points during infection. DCs are unique in their capacity to migrate from the periphery to lymphoid organs or from the blood stream into lymphatic and peripheral tissues. Virus-infected DCs can therefore transport viruses to other parts of the organism and thus contribute to the spreading of the pathogens to many organs during systemic infection. However, DCs are also equipped with a range of receptors (for example Toll-like receptors, TLRs) that recognize conserved molecular patterns of viruses \u2013 either viral proteins or viral nucleic acids with specific distinguishing features (Lund et al., 2003; Krug et al., 2004a, Krug et al., 2004b; Schulz et al., 2005). Triggering of these pattern recognition receptors in virus-infected DCs initiates the innate antiviral immune response, which is essential for limiting further viral dissemination (Dalod et al., 2003; Krug et al., 2004a). The DCs themselves produce inflammatory cytokines and antiviral interferons in response to viral infection. In addition DCs express ligands for activating receptors on the surface of natural killer (NK) cells leading to activation of this innate antiviral effector cell type (Andoniou et al., 2005). DCs are experts in the processing and presentation of viral antigens on MHC class I as well as crosspresentation on MHC class II. The antigen presenting function of DCs is critically involved in the generation of efficient adaptive immunity against viruses (Belz et al., 2004). DC activation by viruses via pattern recognition receptors provides the 2nd and 3rd signals required for the priming of na\u00efve-specific T lymphocytes and their differentiation into effector T cells.",

Thus, the activation of the type I IFN response in pDCs most often is not counteracted by viral immune evasion strategies. Accordingly, active viral replication is not required for the induction of type I IFN production in pDCs for many enveloped viruses, for example Influenza virus or herpes viruses (Krug et al., 2004b; Lund et al., 2003). Following endocytic uptake it is assumed that these viruses are retained in acidified endosomal compartments, where TLR7 and TLR9 are localized, so that the viral particles are degraded and viral nucleic acids come into contact with TLR7 and TLR9. A recent report, however, clearly demonstrates that cytosolic viral replication and a transport mechanism involving autophagy is necessary for triggering the TLR7-dependent response to other RNA viruses, such as VSV or SeV in pDCs (Lee et al., 2007). After infection of pDCs with these RNA viruses, viral replication intermediates in the cytosol are internalized in autophagic vesicles which are then directed towards the TLR7-containing lysosomes, where recognition of the viral RNA occurs (Lee et al., 2007).",

TRIF is recruited to the cytoplasmatic TIR domain of TLR3 and interacts with a set of different signaling molecules and kinases which in turn initiate activation of NF\u03baB or IRF3 and IRF7 leading to type I interferon induction. Interaction of TRIF with TRAF3 allows complex formation with the non-canonical IKKs-TBK1 and IKK\u03b5 leading to the activation of IRF3 and IRF7, which form homo- or heterodimers upon phosphorylation and are then translocated to the nucleus to induce type I IFN and IFN inducible gene expression (Fitzgerald et al., 2003; Sharma et al., 2003; Yamamoto et al., 2003). NF\u03baB activation by TLR3 ligands is mediated in two ways \u2013 via association of TRIF with RIP1 or via interaction of TRIF with TRAF6, which in turn activates TAK1. Both RIP1 and TAK1 mediate activation of canonical IKKs (IKK\u03b1, IKK\u03b2) resulting in I\u03baB degradation and NF\u03baB translocation to the nucleus (Meylan et al., 2004; Sato et al., 2007).",

TLR3-deficient mice are as susceptible to reovirus, VSV and LCMV infection as wild-type mice and there was no significant difference in generating specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses to these viruses (Edelmann et al., 2004). Interestingly, however, virally induced CNS injury was improved by TLR3-deficiency suggesting that inflammatory responses mediated by TLR3 are at least partially responsible for a breakdown of the blood\u2013brain barrier which facilitates and enhances virus entry into the brain. TLR3-deficient mice survived viral CNS infection with West Nile virus (Wang et al., 2004), which is characterized by meningitis and encephalitis induced by inflammatory mediators, for longer time periods than wild-type mice. Similarly, in murine influenza A virus infection TLR3-mediated inflammatory responses in the lung contribute significantly to host morbidity and lethality. Despite higher pulmonary viral loads TLR3\u2212/\u2212 mice showed less inflammation and better survival (Le Goffic et al., 2006). Interestingly, human lung epithelial cells express proinflammatory cytokines including IL-6 and IL-8 upon infection with influenza A virus in a TLR3-dependent manner (Le Goffic et al., 2007), suggesting that TLR3-mediated inflammatory responses may also contribute to influenza virus-induced lung pathology in humans.",

During the second phase secreted type I IFNs signal via type I IFN receptor in an autocrine and paracrine manner. Downstream signaling of the type I IFN receptor induces a strong up-regulation of IRF7 production leading to full expression of type I IFN genes (positive feedback loop).

Several studies have described increased susceptibility of TLR9\u2212/\u2212 mice to systemic murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection (Tabeta et al. 2004; Krug et al., 2004a; Delale et al., 2005). We could show that TLR9-dependent recognition of MCMV by pDCs and conventional DC is clearly involved in the innate immune response to MCMV. In the very early phase of systemic MCMV infection pDCs and conventional DCs release the first wave of type I interferons and inflammatory cytokines including IL-12. The expression of these cytokines peaks between 36 and 38 h post-infection (Dalod et al., 2002; Orange and Biron, 1996b) and triggers non-specific NK cell activation at this time point. Control of viral replication and clearance of the virus from infected organs during the first week of MCMV infection relies mostly on NK cells, which produce IFN-\u03b3 (mediated by IL-12 and IL-18) and kill infected cells (Orange and Biron, 1996a). We found a significant reduction in IFN-\u03b1 and IL-12 serum levels in TLR9- and MyD88-deficient mice at 36 h after infection. However, IFN-\u03b1 serum levels comparable to those of wild-type mice could be observed in TLR9- and MyD88-deficient mice at later time points suggesting the existence of an additional TLR9/MyD88-independent type I IFN induction mechanism with delayed kinetics. Loss of the early IFN-\u03b1 peak is due to an impaired function of pDCs in TLR9\u2212/\u2212 mice as MCMV recognition and type I IFN production are TLR9-dependent in this cell type. pDC depletion in vivo led to markedly reduced IFN-\u03b1 levels at 36 h after infection reflecting their almost exclusive role for IFN-\u03b1 production at this early time point. In contrast to IFN-\u03b1, IL-12 production was severely impaired in TLR9- and MyD88-deficient mice at all time points reflecting the requirement of TLR9 for IL-12 responses to MCMV in all DC subpopulations. IFN-\u03b3 production by NK cells which is induced by IL-12 and IL-18 was also significantly reduced in the absence of TLR9 or MyD88. These defects in the innate immune response to MCMV correlated with higher viral titers in spleen and liver of TLR9\u2212/\u2212 and MyD88\u2212/\u2212 mice on the C57BL/6 background reflecting increased susceptibility to MCMV in the early phase of the infection (Delale et al., 2005; Krug et al., 2004a).",

In two mouse models of local infection with HSV-1 (footpad or eye infection), however, we did not find a significant difference in viral titers between TLR9\u2212/\u2212 and MyD88\u2212/\u2212 mice and wild-type mice (Krug et al., 2004b). The requirement for TLR9 in the innate immune response to herpes viruses in vivo is influenced by the site of virus entry and the recruitment of DC subpopulations to the infected tissue. All of the described in vivo studies show that in addition to TLR9 other pattern recognition receptors and signaling pathways responding to herpes virus infection must exist, which can partially compensate for the lack of TLR9 and other MyD88-dependent receptors (Krug et al., 2004b; Hochrein et al., 2004; Lund et al., 2006). The cytosolic DNA receptor which has been described recently (Stetson and Medzhitov, 2006; Ishii et al., 2006; Takaoka et al., 2007) may also be involved in the TLR9-independent component of the immune response to herpes virus infections.",

TLR7 is expressed in human and murine pDCs, conventional DCs and B cells, whereas TLR8 seems to be functional mainly in human monocytes and myeloid DCs. The role of TLR8 in the murine immune system remains to be elucidated.

TLR7 does not seem to play an essential role in the innate immune response to RNA virus infection in vivo. We could not find a significant difference between MyD88\u2212/\u2212 and wild-type mice in the susceptibility to intranasal influenza virus infection and type I IFN response to intravenously injected influenza virus was only partially reduced in the MyD88-deficient animals (Barchet et al., 2005). At high viral doses type I IFN response to systemic VSV infection is TLR7-dependent and mediated by pDCs, whereas at lower doses TLR7-independent type I IFN induction pathways play the major role. A recent study demonstrates an essential function of TLR7 for the innate immune response to systemic coronavirus infection in mice (Cervantes-Barragan et al., 2006). pDCs, but not conventional DCs are capable of producing significant amounts of type I IFN in response to the rapidly replicating coronaviruses and this response is entirely TLR7-dependent. pDC depletion led to abrogation of type I IFN response and increased disease severity (Cervantes-Barragan et al., 2006). It can be concluded that TLR7 (and possibly TLR8 in the human system) contribute to the initiation of the antiviral immune response against viruses which specifically target pDCs. In addition the ubiquitously expressed RNA helicases provide protection against RNA viruses in all cell types (see below). Depending on the route and kinetics of infection, cellular tropism, viral entry and replication as well as immune evasion mechanisms of individual virus strains one or the other viral RNA recognition pathway may dominate the innate antiviral immune response in vivo.",

IRAK-4-deficient patients are prone to invasive infection with pneumococci, but are resistant to natural viral infection (Picard et al., 2003). IRAK4-deficient PBMC do not respond to any of the MyD88-dependent TLR ligands, but are capable of type I IFN production in response to many DNA and RNA viruses. There also seems to be considerable redundancy between different TLRs, because in contrast to the IRAK4-deficient patients, which show no significant defects in antiviral responses (Picard et al., 2003), individuals with autosomal recessive deficiency in the intracellular protein Unc-93b have an impaired antiviral type I IFN response and are susceptible to HSV-1 encephalitis (Casrouge et al., 2006). Unc-93b-deficiency prevents signaling in response to ligands of the endosomally localized TLR3, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9 (Tabeta et al., 2006). In addition, the Unc-93b protein, which is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, is required for efficient crosspresentation and MHC class II presentation of exogenous antigens (Tabeta et al., 2006). Therefore, Unc-93b-deficiency may affect innate and adaptive antiviral immune responses at the same time. No human deficiencies or mutation in the RIG-I/MDA5 pathway of RNA virus recognition have been described so far. However, the critical role of this major pathway for innate antiviral immune responses in humans is greatly supported by the existence of viral immune evasion strategies, which, for example, are employed by hepatitis C virus and paramyxoviruses and are directed against several signaling molecules in this pathway (see below).",

DExD/H box RNA helicases are defined by their ability to unwind dsRNA using their intrinsic ATPase activity. In addition to the C-terminal helicase domain RIG-I contains two caspase recruitment domains (CARD) at its N terminus (Zhang et al., 2000). CARDs are found in a number of caspases, but also in other proteins such as NOD1 and NOD2, involved in sensing intracellular bacterial products (Inohara and Nunez, 2003). The functions of RIG-I have been analyzed in detail in the first publication by Yoneyama et al. (2004) using deletion constructs of full length RIG-I. Overexpression of the N-terminal region of RIG-I (delta RIG-I) comprising the two tandem CARDs is sufficient to induce IRF3 and NF\u03baB activation even in the absence of a dsRNA stimulus or viral challenge. The mutant of RIG-I lacking the CARD domain is not capable of transmitting signals. This N-terminally truncated molecule even has a dominant negative effect since expression of this domain alone prevents activation of IRF3 by dsRNA transfection or NDV infection (Yoneyama et al., 2004).",

            "text": "Since CARDs are known to engage in homophilic protein\u2013protein interactions in other signal transduction pathways, it was therefore likely that the CARDs of RIG-I interact with other CARD containing molecules to activate downstream signaling molecules. The adaptor protein that links RIG-I to the activation of TBK1/IKK\u03b5 and IKK\u03b2 was identified and functionally characterized by four independent groups and designated as IFN-\u03b2 promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1) (Kawai et al., 2005), mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) (Seth et al., 2005), virus-induced signaling adapter (VISA) (Xu et al., 2005) and CARD adapter inducing IFN-\u03b2 (CARDIF) (Meylan et al., 2005), respectively. IPS-1 contains an N-terminal CARD domain that interacts with the tandem CARD domains of RIG-I and a C-terminal hydrophobic transmembrane (TM) domain that localizes it to the outer mitochondrial membrane (Seth et al., 2005). Deletion analyses have shown that both the CARD and the transmembrane domain are essential for the function of IPS-1. The mitochondrial localization of IPS-1 is essential for its activity because deletion of the TM domain, which leads to cytosolic expression of the protein, abolishes the signaling function of IPS-1. The binding of dsRNA to the helicase domain of RIG-I likely induces a conformational change that exposes the N-terminal CARD domains to recruit its signaling adaptor IPS-1. This interaction subsequently induces IFN-\u03b1/INF-\u03b2 and IFN-induced antiviral effector mechanisms that suppress virus replication (Meylan et al., 2006).",

Expression of the C-terminal RD domain, encompassing the amino acids 735\u2013925 of the RIG-I protein, prevents signaling to the IFN-\u03b2 promoter and increased cellular permissiveness to hepatitis C virus, whereas deletion of the RIG-I RD results in constitutive signaling. Saito et al. suggest a model of RIG-I autoregulation and signaling predicting that in resting cells the C-terminal RD mediates a conformation of RIG-I that masks the CARDs from signaling. Once the cell is infected with virus, RIG-I activation and signaling occurs in a stepwise manner involving dsRNA binding and conformational changes that subsequently facilitate self-association and interaction with the IPS-1 signaling adaptor. These conformational changes comprising displacement of the RD and unmasking of the CARDs for signaling via IPS-1 might be triggered by ATP hydrolysis. Saito et al. also identified an analogous RD within the C terminus of LGP2 suggesting that LGP2 might inhibit RIG-I through their RD interactions. LGP2 is a close relative of RIG-I, which lacks the CARDs, but is capable of binding dsRNA (Yoneyama et al., 2005). Thus, LGP2 may act as a postinduction repressor of RIG-I signaling (Rothenfusser et al., 2005).",

Since RNA is a fundamental entity of most living organisms and is found in abundance in host cells, a molecular pattern must exist that enables RIG-I to discriminate between viral RNA and host RNA species in the cytoplasm of infected cells to prevent constant induction of type I IFNs which would lead to autoimmune responses. Two recent studies have identified features of viral RNA that are structurally different to host RNA. Hornung et al. (2006) demonstrated that ssRNA synthesized in vitro acquires a 5\u2032-triphosphate moiety which is crucial for IFN production in host cells. Furthermore, they demonstrated that RNA isolated from Rabies virus (RV) infected cells is a potent IFN inducer, whereas RNA from non-infected cells and dephosphorylated RNA isolates abrogated this IFN response. The 5\u2032-phosphorylation status and the absence of a 7-methyl-guanosine cap provided by the viral polymerase is critical for recognition by RIG-I. Taken together, the results of Hornung et al. (2006) show that RIG-I directly recognizes 5\u2032-triphosphate single stranded or double stranded RNA independently of viral replication. In the second study, Pichlmair et al. (2006) found that Influenza A virus, which is known to be sensed by both RIG-I and TLR3, did not generate dsRNA upon infection of bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells. Moreover, they observed that Influenza virus ssRNA, which is uncapped and bears 5\u2032-triphosphates, associated with and activated RIG-I.",

This receptor\u2013adapter interaction results in the activation of the noncanonical kinases TBK1/IKK\u03b5, which in turn induces dimerization of phosphorylated IRF3 and IRF7 and translocation to the nucleus where they activate the transcription of type I IFN genes (Kawai et al., 2005). Coimmunoprecipitation experiments suggest that IPS-1 interacts with TBK1 and recruits endogenous IRF3 in a virus-inducible manner (Xu et al., 2005). Recently, TRAF3 was shown to be critically involved in IPS-1-mediated IFN-\u03b1 production and antiviral responses through a direct interaction between the TRAF domain of TRAF3 and a TRAF interaction motif within IPS-1 (Saha et al., 2006). There is evidence that the TBK1/IKK\u03b5 adaptor protein TANK plays a role in IPS-1-TRAF3-mediated activation of TBK1/IKK\u03b5 (Guo and Cheng, 2007). RIP1 and FADD are additional molecules that have been reported to be required for type I IFN production in response to dsRNA (Balachandran et al., 2004).",

Previous work showed that IPS-1 activates a NF\u03baB-dependent reporter construct in cultured cells (Matsuda et al., 2003). One of the key signaling proteins in the NF\u03baB pathway is TRAF6, an essential upstream regulator of the IKK complex. IPS-1 binds to TRAF6 upon overexpression in mammalian cells and in a yeast-two hybrid screen (Seth et al., 2005; Xu et al., 2005). Xu et al. (2005) reported that endogenous IPS-1 also interacts with TRAF6. In addition, they showed that IPS-1 fails to activate NF\u03baB in the absence of TRAF6. Seth et al. (2005) reported that virus-mediated induction of the IFN-\u03b2 gene is not abolished in TRAF6 deficient cells and that a mutant IPS-1 protein lacking the TRAF6 binding domain is still capable of inducing IFN-\u03b2. Thus, TRAF6 seems to be required for NF\u03baB activation but not IFN-\u03b2 induction downstream of IPS-1 which is mainly mediated by TBK1/IKK\u03b5.",

The experiments demonstrated that type I IFN production by RIG-I deficient fibroblasts and conventional DCs is severely impaired in response to these RNA viruses. In contrast, pDCs lacking RIG-I show normal type I IFN responses to NDV or VSV for example, as the pDC response to these viruses is mediated by TLR7 (Kato et al., 2005). The studies performed so far indicate that the RNA helicases RIG-I and MDA5 as well as their common signaling adaptor IPS-1 are dispensible for viral triggering of type I IFN responses in pDCs (Kato et al., 2006).",

            "text": "MDA5 is another DExD/H-box-containing RNA helicase that is involved in the sensing of intracellular dsRNA and the induction of type I IFN in response to RNA viruses (Andrejeva et al., 2004). It is the closest relative of RIG-I, exhibiting 23 and 35% amino acid homology in the N-terminal CARD and C-terminal helicase domain, respectively. It was reported in a previous publication, that MDA5, which was then called Helicard, is cleaved by caspases upon induction of apoptosis, thereby separating the CARD domains from the C-terminal helicase domain, which localizes to the nucleus where it is involved in DNA degradation and nuclear remodelling during apoptotic cell death (Kovacsovics et al., 2002). Furthermore, MDA5 has been implicated in the regulation of the growth and differentiation of melanoma cells (Kang et al., 2002). MDA5 is ubiquitously expressed in low abundance and similarly to RIG-I and LGP2 its expression is induced by type I IFN. Like RIG-I, MDA5 interacts with the adapter protein IPS-1 upon ligand binding leading to activation of protein kinases that subsequently activate transcription factors IRF3, IRF7 and NF\u03baB, respectively. It was found recently by Sato et al. (2007) that in contrast to RIG-I, the C-terminal regulatory domain of MDA5 did not exert a repressor function on MDA5 signaling, which was also not inhibited by LGP2. MDA5 overexpression in cell lines even at low levels induces IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity in the absence of ligand binding. Thus, MDA5 expression which is up-regulated in response to type I IFN signaling may function as an amplifier of type I IFN production even in the absence of specific MDA5 ligands.",

In vitro studies performed with embryonic fibroblasts and conventional DCs derived from MDA5 knockout mice have shown that MDA5 is specifically required for the recognition of intracellular poly (I:C) dsRNA (but not in vitro transcribed PPP-RNA) and picornaviruses such as encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), Theiler's virus and Mengo virus, whereas RIG-I was not necessary for the response to poly (I:C) or picornaviruses (Kato et al., 2006; Gitlin et al., 2006). In addition, it was shown that MDA5 might also play a role in the measles virus (MV) induced activation of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA synthesis since A549 cells transfected with MDA5 showed a strong activation of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter upon infection with MV. In contrast, the virus did not enhance reporter gene activity in cells that overexpressed RIG-I (Berghall et al., 2006). MDA5 was not required for recognition of VSV, NDV, JEV, SeV and influenza virus, indicating that RIG-I was the predominant pattern recognition receptor for these viruses. It is currently unknown which specific viral RNA motifs in picornaviruses are recognized by MDA5 and how ligand specificity is determined on the molecular level.",

            "text": "The in vivo relevance of the RIG-I and MDA5 pathways for innate antiviral immune responses was addressed by the generation of knockout mice. The specific susceptibility of MDA5-deficient mice to encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) infection was shown in two studies (Kato et al., 2006; Gitlin et al., 2006). In a direct comparison with IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 and MyD88\u2212/\u2212 mice Kato et al. (2006) could show that survival upon EMCV infection is as dramatically reduced in MDA5\u2212/\u2212 mice as in IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice. MyD88-deficient mice were only slightly more susceptible to EMCV infection than wild-type mice. Survival after EMCV infection was not affected by RIG-I- or TLR3-deficiency. Studies in the IPS-1 knockout mouse confirmed the dramatic reduction in the innate immune response to EMCV infection, which correlated with increased viral titers and decreased survival, in the absence of the central downstream signaling adaptor of MDA5 and RIG-I (Kumar et al., 2006). Only few in vivo experiments with RIG-I-deficient mice have been published so far, because for unknown reasons most of the RIG-I-knockout mice (on a 129/C57BL/6 mixed background) died in utero or within a few weeks after birth (Kato et al., 2006). After crossing with ICR mice healthy RIG-I\u2212/\u2212 mice were obtained and compared with littermate controls in the JEV and VSV infection models. RIG-I\u2212/\u2212 mice were more susceptible to JEV and VSV infection than wild-type mice and this correlated with reduced type I IFN responses. MyD88-dependent type I IFN production induced by JEV and VSV played only a minor role in these infection models (Kato et al., 2006). In accordance with these results IPS-1-deficient mice succumbed rapidly to VSV infection (Sun et al., 2006). As pointed out by the study of Sun et al. (2006), type I IFN responses to systemic VSV infection were not entirely abrogated in IPS-1-deficient mice, suggesting that TLR7-dependent pDC-mediated type I IFN release at least partially compensates for the dysfunctional RNA helicase pathway, but this compensatory mechanism cannot prevent death after infection with high doses of VSV.",

RIG-I was recently demonstrated to be essential for the induction of IFN-\u03b2 by Influenza virus in murine cells. Furthermore, it was observed that NS1 colocalizes with RIG-I (Mibayashi et al., 2007), suggesting that NS1 forms a complex with RIG-I and IPS-1 during viral infection, resulting in inhibition of further downstream signaling. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) specifically interferes with IRF3 activation and IFN-\u03b2 response: Two viral proteins of RSV, NS1 and NS2, are involved in blocking the pathway leading to IRF3 phosphorylation, although the activation of NF\u03baB and AP-1 is unaffected (Bossert et al., 2003). IRF3 phosphorylation by TBK1 was identified as target of the Rabies virus phosphoprotein P (Brzozka et al., 2005).

Interestingly, IPS-1 was also found to be localized to the cytosol and not the mitochondria in liver tissue from patients chronically infected with HCV (Loo et al., 2006). Inhibitors of the HCV NS3/4A, which have originally been designed to inhibit HCV replication, are able to prevent IPS-1 cleavage and restore the RIG-I-mediated innate immune response to HCV (Johnson et al., 2007). Therefore, NS3/4A inhibitors which are already being tested in clinical trials may have therapeutic potential for chronic hepatitis C infection. The fact that RNA viruses have developed so many effective strategies to interfere with the RNA helicase pathway of viral recognition during coevolution with their host provides further proof for the central role of this pathway in antiviral immune defense.",
