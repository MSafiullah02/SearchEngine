LASV is endemic, particularly in the West African countries of Sierra Leone, The Republic of Guinea, Nigeria, and Liberia2,3. The transmission of LASV to humans occurs through the urine or feces of infected Mastomys rats and the virus spreads human-to-human through direct contact with the blood, urine, feces, or other bodily secretions of an infected person. LASV can be fatal and no approved effective therapeutics are currently available. The development of therapeutics such as antibodies and vaccines for the treatment of LASV is therefore of significant urgency4\u20136.",

GP results from the cleavage of a 75 kDa precursor polypeptide, GPC by signal peptidase and then further glycosylated and processed into GP1 and GP27. GP1 is the receptor-binding subunit, and GP2 is the membrane-spanning fusion subunit8\u201310. The virion envelope protein spikes are composed of three heterotrimers, with each heterotrimer containing signal peptide, GP1, and GP211,12, shown in Fig. 1. A chalice-like GP trimer interacts with receptors on the cell surface, for example matriglycan, which mediates the entry of the virus into the host cell. In addition, the GP also interact with ERGIC-53 in the exocytic pathway, which helps to form infectious virions13. GP is considered to be a key factor for LASV growth, cell tropism, host range and pathogenicity, and as it is the only protein situated on the LASV virion surface, GP becomes a primary target for vaccine design4.",

Analysis of the GP-37.7 H antibody complex shows that the antibody simultaneously binds to two GP monomers at the base of the GP trimer. The binding involves four discontinuous regions of LASV GP: two in site A and two in site B. Site A contains residues 62 and 63 of the N-terminal loop of GP1 and residues 387 to 408 in the T-loop (residues 365\u2013384) and HR2 (residues 400\u2013412) regions of GP2. Site B contains residues 269 to 275 of the fusion peptide and residues 324 to 325 of HR1 (residues 311\u2013355) of GP24,14. Although the antibody predominantly binds to GP2, GP1 is required to maintain the proper prefusion conformation of GP2 for antibody binding4.",

            "text": "Identification of epitopes is an essential step for understanding disease etiology, immunotherapy, immunodiagnostics, and the discovery and development of epitope based-vaccines. An epitope-based vaccine has fewer side effects compared to conventional vaccines. Experimental identification of a promiscuous epitope involves many expensive and time-consuming steps, including the production of antibodies to map antigenic regions on a target protein, animal models, and determination of the crystal structure of antigen-antibody complexes using X-Ray crystallography. Computational identification of epitopes is often employed as a powerful and fast approach to facilitate the identification of potential epitope candidates that can decrease the number of validation experiments and time15,16. Multi-epitope based vaccine development has already proven effective against several viral infections and cancer17,18. In this study, we have identified and characterized T and B-cell epitopes for the LASV GP using different sequence and structure-based computational epitope prediction methods. We then selected potential B and T-cell epitopes for the LASV GP based on a consensus approach, and the novelty of the epitopes was examined with the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) tools. Subsequently, we identified strongly binding alleles to the MHC-I T-cell epitopes and modeled the allele structures and performed docking to understand the interaction between alleles and epitopes. We further investigated the stability and dynamics of the epitope-allele complexes using molecular dynamics simulations. Analyses of root-mean square deviations, hydrogen bond, interaction energy, and solvent accessibility showed that epitope-allele complexes are stable, indicating that the epitopes strongly bind to the alleles. The identified B and T-cell epitopes of LASV GP in the study can be useful for the development of effective vaccines against Lassa hemorrhagic fever.",

However, we validated the capability of the docking protocol before docking the epitopes by redocking the epitopes into the allele crystal structure (PDB ID:3OX8) to see whether the crystal bound conformation of the peptide could be reproduced or not. The docked allele-epitope complex showed the same residue-epitope interactions observed in the epitope bound crystal structure, indicating that the Autodock Vina docking protocol was capable of reproducing the experimentally observed binding mode of the epitope. We applied Autodock Vina to each of the four MHC-I allele-epitope complexes. Autodock Vina found that the highest ranked docking structure had the following binding affinities: \u22125.5 kcal/mol for A1::E1 \u22125.0 kcal/mol for A2::E2, \u22126.8 kcal/mol for A3::E3, and \u22126.0 for A4::E4.

To quantitatively understand the stability of the allele-epitope complex, we calculated the root mean square deviations (RMSD) of the backbone atoms of the allele-epitope complexes as a function of simulation time as shown in Fig. 5. Figure 5 also includes curves of the RMSD of the backbone atoms of just the allele, and separately, just the backbone atoms of the epitope. All alleles have an RMSD compared to their initial structures of approximately 2 \u00c5, whereas the allele-epitope complexes have a bit higher RMSD of approximately 2.5 \u00c5, indicating that the epitopes make the complexes more flexible. Interestingly, in the case of A3::E3, the allele and the complex show almost the same RMSD, suggesting that the complex is especially stable. To pinpoint why the complexes show a higher RMSD, we further computed the RMSD of only the backbone atoms of the epitope in each the complex. Figure 4 shows that the initial configuration of epitopes E1 and E4 is compact, and that both of these epitopes rearrange their configuration in the binding site and elongate during the 200 ns MD simulation. This elongated configuration is consistent with the investigations of Antunes et al.61 on MHC-I epitopes.",

Therefore, there is an urgent need for the discovery and development of potential antiviral therapeutics. The LASV GP spike has emerged as a promising selective target for the development of novel vaccines as it plays an essential role in the virus-host interaction. Several in-silico studies62\u201367 were performed to predict LASV GP epitopes with the use of a single prediction tool for each type of epitope. We have identified new T and B-cell epitopes using a variety of computational approaches, including twelve epitope prediction methods, protein-peptide docking, and MD simulations. The MHC I and II T-cell epitopes were separately predicted with the LASV GP sequence using well-known prediction methods. The predicted MHC I T-cell epitopes then were prioritized based on the consensus score, binding affinity, and antigenicity, while MHC II T and B-cell epitopes were prioritized based on the consensus score. Novelty analysis of the consensus-selected 33 epitopes showed that thirty of these predicted epitopes have either no overlap or only a partial overlap to previously reported sequences. Within this list of new epitopes, six sequences have no overlap with any known experimentally tested epitopes in the IEDB. In addition, docking and MD simulations were performed to further validate the MHC I T-cell epitopes. The simulation results show that the allele-MHC-I epitopes are stable, with favorable hydrogen-bond and interaction energy. Of these, Epitope E3 (233FSRPSPIGY241) segment was found to be especially stable. This study demonstrates that the adopted consensus epitope prediction strategy is valuable for in-silico investigations of known epitopes and the identification of new epitopes. Experimental validation of these epitopes may lead to the design and development of effective LASV vaccines.",
