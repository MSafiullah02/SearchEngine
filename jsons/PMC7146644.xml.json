The number of manuscripts received sharply increased from 180 in 2016 to 928 in 2019 (Fig. 1a; the data of 2015 were not included in the figure due to some uncertainty that existed in that year\u2019s dataset), while the number of published articles jumped from 43 papers in 2015 to 225 in 2019 (Fig. 1b). We predict that 1200 manuscripts and 300 articles will be received and published in 2020, respectively. We are also very pleased to see the impact factor of our journal rising from 1.152 in 2018 to 1.462 in 2019. The improvement of both the number of citations and the impact factor indicates a steady advance of the journal\u2019s quality and impact.",
