The primary outcome of this study was the \u201cadverse event,\u201d defined as injuries caused by medical mismanagement resulting in disability at discharge or prolonged length of stay. Adverse events occurred in 3.7% of hospitalizations, of which 28% were judged to be due to negligence. Another US study, using the same methodology in a random sample of patients from Colorado and Utah, found adverse events in 2.9% of admissions as compared to 3.7% in the New York study [5], suggesting that these rates are probably reasonably representative for the U.S. Data are now available from a number of large studies around the world regarding the frequency of adverse events, and essentially all of these demonstrate that adverse events are significant problems [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. Most data so far come from the developed world. For example, the Quality in Australian Healthcare Study (QAHCS) identified an adverse event rate of 16.6% [6]. A subsequent study, comparing the adverse event rate in the QAHCS to that from the Medical Practice study, found that most of the differences in incidence were related to methodological differences between the two studies, although there was also a higher adverse event rate in Australia [7]. Vincent found that in United Kingdom, 10.7% of patients experienced one or more adverse events [8]. In New Zealand, an adverse event rate of 12.9% was identified in one study [9]. Numerous studies are currently underway in other countries, including Canada and Japan.",

For example, in Brazil, a study of 212 patients showed that among 46 patients, 80 errors had occurred relating to pressure ulcers, mechanical ventilation, IV catheters and medications [10]. Korea has no detailed data about iatrogenic accidents, such as adverse drug events, hospital infection, even though some physicians and nurses realize the importance of a systematic approach about these issues. In part for cultural reasons, iatrogenic injuries represent an especially sensitive and political issue in Korea. While the medical malpractice case rate has increased recently, and there is increasing public concern, there are still no organized systems to monitor adverse event rates. The few websites addressing iatrogenic accidents mostly focused on legal issues, such as reimbursement and insurance claims. These data make it clear that iatrogenic injury and adverse events are major international issues",

For example, adverse drug events are the leading cause of injury in most studies and nurses are in an excellent position to play an active role in this area, since they administer most drugs and interact with patients and families more frequently than other providers. Pressure ulcer prevention is primarily a nursing issue. Surgical adverse events and nosocomial infections are also important. These can be both identified and, in many instances, prevented by nurses. In a study by Needleman, who looked at staffing ratios and level of outcomes for patients in a large multistate study, there was consistent evidence of an association between higher levels of staffing by registered nurses and lower rates of adverse outcomes, such as urinary tract infections, upper gastrointestinal bleeding and hospital-acquired pneumonia [11].",

A British study suggested that adverse events were responsible for an average of 8.5 additional bed days, and resulted in a direct cost of \u00a3290,000 to the trust concerned, and the overall estimate was that preventable events cost the National Health Service approximately 1 billion pounds annually [8].",

The rest of the time was spent primarily managing and coordinating the communication of patient information to other departments, physicians, and members of the health care team. However, time spent in managing communication and information is not sufficient to ensure a safe health care environment. Other approaches, including greatly expanded use of information and communication technology, are needed to help nurses prevent errors.

A team approach is best in designing hospital units or community clinics to prevent errors. For example, design teams were created for the new facility at St. Joseph\u2019s Community Hospital of West Bend, WI, and followed guiding principles to develop the new facility. The design was patient-centred, created a healing environment, was efficient, safe, technologically advanced and staff-friendly [17].",

A CIS can link to bibliographic databases, such as PubMed. Another benefit is the ability to use standardized languages, such as nursing diagnoses, outcomes and interventions [19], [20], [21]. The nurse can refer to a list of nursing interventions appropriate for a diabetic patient, providing links between interventions, outcomes and nursing diagnoses. The nurse can then develop a pathway that can be accessed by other care providers. CIS vendors, in the past, have included nursing diagnoses, but have not linked them to complete standardized vocabularies and are only now seeking nursing input [12].",

A recent study at University of Pennsylvania Hospital regarding job satisfaction among nursing staff indicated that job dissatisfaction among nurses with high patient-to-staff ratios was associated with higher patient mortality [34].

Specific areas affected by IT are charting, care standards and medication administration. Nurses need to know that they are a significant part of the health care system. Nurse administrators and leaders are seeking ways to support their professional staff, by listening to ideas for role improvement and keeping an open line of communication with all nurses. Nurse managers need to discuss safety issues that occur on the nursing unit with their staff, as well as with the multidisciplinary team, to assess ways that errors can be reduced. Discussing journal articles or forming a \u201cNursing Journal Club\u201d can be an effective way for sharing and promoting evidence-based practice. Asking interested nurses to be a representative on a department committee and giving them time to do so can make staff members feel appreciated and part of the process.",
