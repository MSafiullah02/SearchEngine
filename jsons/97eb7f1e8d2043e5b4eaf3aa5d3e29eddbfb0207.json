A hard requirement is that the platforms actively participate in the initiative and have implemented the corresponding API for their systems. The API developed under a free license is publicly available and represents the greatest success of the campaign to date. Within CLEF, LL4IR was first organized as a lab in the form of a challenge at the CLEF 2015 conference series and continued with TREC OpenSearch 2016 and 2017 [2] .",

The common interest in academic search seems small compared to these scenarios. Many information systems are based on bibliographical metadata (e.g., WoS, Scopus, PubMed) and do not make use of full-text information, which in most cases is not available due to licensing hiccups of the academic publishing system. Even when full-text is searchable, the characteristics of scientific communication are not thoroughly operationalized and are even ignored. This leads to simple search systems that still heavenly rely on Boolean Retrieval techniques to get the most out of the available (meta-)data. Although during the last years, the BIR community added much traction for the overall topic of academic search, it is not focusing on the rigorous evaluation of proposed methods. The lack of an overall evaluation scenario leads to little understanding of the consequences for the different domains and fields of science.",

In this track, a corpus of bibliographic records and research project descriptions from the Social Sciences was created to test the special needs of scientific retrieval tasks. As stated by the organizers: \"General-purpose news documents require very different search criteria than those used for reference retrieval in databases of scientific literature items, and also offer no possibility for comparable test runs with domain-specific terminology.\" The DS track ran for many years and developed a total of four versions of the GIRT test collection of scientific reference documents.
