In China, the COVID-19 epidemic grew exponentially during January 2020, peaking on 12th February 2020 with 15,153 newly confirmed cases per day. One month later, reported COVID-19 cases in China dropped to ~20 per day, indicating the epidemic there was contained. However, the number of cases reported outside of China has risen exponentially since the second half of February 2020. By 11th March 2020, the day that the World Health Organization (WHO) announced COVID-19 to be a new pandemic, 37,371 cases had been reported outside of China (World Health Organization, 2020).",

In this study, we combine genetic and epidemiological data to investigate the genetic diversity, evolution, and epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Guangdong Province. We generated virus genome sequences from 53 patients in Guangdong using both metagenomic sequencing and multiplex PCR amplification followed by nanopore sequencing. Through phylogenetic analysis, interpreted in the context of available epidemiological information, we sought to investigate the timing and relative contributions of imported cases versus local transmission, the nature of genetically distinct transmission chains within Guangdong, and how the emergency response in Guangdong was reflected in the reduction and elimination of these transmission chains. Our results may provide valuable information for implementing and interpreting genomic surveillance of COVID-19 in other regions.",

This included monitoring (1) all travelers returning from Hubei or other regions with high epidemic activity, (2) their close contacts, and (3) all hospitalized patients in clinics, including those without fever or respiratory symptoms, regardless of their exposure history. Approximately 1.35 million samples were screened by six third-party institutions between 30th January and 15th March 2020. Surveillance commenced at Guangdong airports in early March, following the growth of COVID-19 outbreaks outside of China. In total, ~1.6 million tests were performed by 19th March 2020, identifying 1,388 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases in 20 of 21 prefectures in Guangdong Province (Figure 1B). Around a quarter of cases (336) were judged to be linked to local transmission and two-thirds (1,014) had a likely exposure history in Hubei (see STAR Methods). For locally infected cases, 181 (53%) were linked to transmission among household members. More than half of the reported cases (60%) were from the cities of Shenzhen and Guangzhou (Figure 1B). We note that the number of detected cases will be less than the true number of infections, although the degree of under-reporting is unknown. Surveillance was targeted toward travelers, hence these data may overestimate the proportion of travel-associated cases.",

An alternative explanation is the interaction between two particular primers, resulting in primer dimer formation (Itokawa et al., 2020). After completion of this study, the primers have been redesigned to address these issues and improve coverage (Quick 2020). Shared and unique single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were observed at 97 sites across the SARS-CoV-2 genome (Figures 2D and 2E), with 77 SNPs present in only one genome.

The SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Guangdong (red) are interspersed with viral lineages sampled from other Chinese provinces and other countries (gray). This pattern agrees with the epidemiological time series in Figure 1A, indicating that most detected cases were linked to travel rather than local community transmission. Despite this, there were a number of instances where sequences from Guangdong appeared to cluster together, sometimes with sequences sampled from other regions. To explore these lineages in more detail, we performed a Bayesian molecular clock analysis that places the phylogenetic history of the genomes on an estimated timescale. A summary visualization of the maximum clade credibility tree from that analysis is shown in Figure 3B and is largely congruent with the ML tree. The current low genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 genomes worldwide means that most internal nodes have very low posterior probabilities; we caution that no conclusions should be drawn from these branching events as they will be informed by the phylogenetic prior distribution rather than variable nucleotide sites (Figure 3A). Nevertheless, five clusters (denoted A\u2013E) containing Guangdong sequences had posterior probability support of >80% (i.e., their sequences grouped monophyletically in >80% of trees in the posterior sample; Figure 3B). These clusters were also observed in the ML phylogeny (Figure 3A).

The observed duration of each phylogenetic cluster (tMRCA to most recently sampled sequence) ranged from 9.49 (cluster B) to 45.2 (cluster D) days. The clusters with earlier tMRCAs contain more sequences from travelers sampled outside of China, possibly reflecting a decrease in air passenger travel from Guangdong after January 2020 (Flightradar24, 2020).

Specifically, it is known that undersampling of regions with high incidence can lead to phylogenetic analyses underestimating the number of introductions into recipient locations and overestimating the size and duration of transmission chains in those recipient locations (Grubaugh et al., 2017, Kraemer et al., 2018). For example, the largest Guangdong phylogenetic cluster (denoted A in Figures 3 and 4) comprises 8 sequences, none of which are placed at the root of the cluster, and it is tempting to conclude that the entire cluster derived from community transmission within Guangdong. However, 6 of the 8 genomes reported travel from Hubei and therefore the cluster in fact represents multiple SARS-CoV-2 introductions into Guangdong, with dates of symptom onset around or shortly after the shutdown of travel from Wuhan (Figure 4).",

This suggests that the large-scale surveillance and intervention measures implemented in Guangdong were effective in interrupting community transmission in a densely populated urban region, ultimately containing the epidemic and limiting the potential for dissemination to other regions (Leung et al., 2020). However, vigilance is still required as there remains a risk that SARS-CoV-2 transmission could reignite in Guangdong following the recent increase in the number of COVID-19 cases imported to China from other countries.",

The number of mutations that define phylogenetic lineages are small (often one), and may be similar to the number of sequence differences arising from errors introduced during reverse transcription, PCR amplification, or sequencing. Bayesian estimates of divergence times (Rannala and Yang, 1996), such as the tMRCA of the pandemic, are based on aggregate numbers of mutations and informed by dense sampling through time, and are thus expected to be more robust. Further, the low and variable sampling of COVID-19 cases among different regions makes it challenging to evaluate phylogenetic clusters that comprise cases from a single region; although such clusters could indeed represent local transmission, our results show they can also include multiple introductions from a genomically undersampled location. Therefore, as with all phylogenetic analyses, the SARS-CoV-2 genomes must be interpreted in the context of all available epidemiological information.",

The nanopore sequencing platform takes less than 24 hours to obtain 10Gb of sequencing data, achieving between 0.3\u20130.6 million reads per sample. The ARTIC bioinformatics pipeline for COVID (https://artic.network/ncov-2019) was used to generate consensus sequences and call single nucleotide changes relative to the reference sequence. SNP differences were sometimes observed when the same sample was sequenced using different sequencing approaches. These differences were random and not platform specific and, upon close inspection of the reads, most likely resulted from low coverage regions in the metagenomics data. Only the single highest-quality genome was retained per patient.",

Viral loads were estimated using RT-PCR with serial diluted plasmid as a standard. At each dilution level we performed multiplex PCR and nanopore sequencing and assembly as per the approach above, except that reads were assembled against the consensus genome obtained from the original sample using metagenomic sequencing. As expected, relative virus load, % genome coverage, and average read depth decreased at higher dilutions. Genome coverage exceeded 75% for all except the final dilution (Table S1.3).",

Linear regression of root-to-tip genetic distance against sampling date indicated that the SARS-CoV-2 sequences evolve in clock-like manner (r = 0.592) (Figure S3\n). The Bayesian coalescent tree analysis was undertaken with BEAST v1.10.4 (Ayres et al., 2012, Suchard et al., 2018), also using the HKY+\u23084 substitution model with gamma-distributed rate variation with an exponential population growth tree prior and a strict molecular clock, under a non-informative continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) reference prior (Ferreira and Suchard 2008). Taxon sets were defined and used to estimate the posterior probability of monophyly and the posterior distribution of the tMRCA of observed phylogenetic clusters A-E (Table S1.2). Two independent chains were run for 100 million states and parameters and trees were sampled every 10,000 states. Upon completion, chains were combined using LogCombiner after removing 10% of states as burn-in and convergence was assessed with Tracer (Rambaut et al., 2018). The maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree was inferred from the Bayesian posterior tree distribution using TreeAnnotator, and visualized with figtreejs-react (https://github.com/jtmccr1/figtreejs-react). Monophyly and tMRCA (time to the most recent common ancestor) statistics were calculated for each taxon set from the posterior tree distribution.",
