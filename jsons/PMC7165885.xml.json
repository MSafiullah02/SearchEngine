            "text": "Rabies is a neurotropic and infectious zoonosis with a high fatality rate (Jackson 2013). Among several species carrying rabies, dogs act as the predominant reservoir for the virus. Rabid dogs transmit the virus through infected saliva by penetrating the skin of humans or animals through bites (Schupbach et al. 2012) and pose potential threat to humans. Rabies detection has been extensively studied for decades. The fluorescent antibody test (FAT) was first applied as a technical recommendation by the World Health Organization (WHO) in the 1950s and is still widely used for the detection of the rabies virus antigen in the cerebral tissue of infected animals (Whitfield et al. 2001; Wunner and Briggs 2010). FAT, together with the rapid tissue culture infection test (RTCIT) and the mouse inoculation test (MIT), serves as the golden standard for rabies detection. While these techniques have good reproducibility and high accuracy (Kasempimolporn et al. 2011), they require well\u2010trained personnel to perform the characteristic stringent protocols, thus limiting their application.",

To assess the immunization status of the infected or immunized animal or the effectiveness of the vaccine, it is recommended that the animal serum be monitored after infection or immunization (De Benedictis et al. 2012). New antigen detection\u2010based assays have recently become available for rabies diagnosis, including the recently developed immunochromatographic tests (Wang et al. 2010) that provide a one\u2010step, rapid and low\u2010cost tool for naked eye detection. Among these methods, ELISA is the one prescribed in international trade, wherein the evaluation of vaccine responses in canines and felines prior to international movement is mandatory (Servat and Cliquet 2006).",
