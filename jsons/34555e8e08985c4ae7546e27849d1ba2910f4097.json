Frequently used medicines (median-maximum dose/24h) were opioids (morphine, 10-30mg; fentanyl, 100-200mcg; alfentanil 500-1000 mcg) and midazolam (10-20mg).

The two trusts comprise four hospitals and include a Highly Communicable Infectious Disease Unit. They serve populations with among the highest prevalence of COVID-19 in the UK. Data collection and analysis: Data were extracted from medical and nursing case notes by clinicianresearchers (NL, PE, KT, JB and SE). Variables included: Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics; referral ward; comorbidities categorized by the Elixhauser Index; 4 clinician-assessed Palliative Care Phase of Illness (Stable, Unstable, Deteriorating, and Dying or Deceased) based on care needs and suitability of the current care plan; 5 and Australia-modified Karnofsky Performance Status (AKPS).", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF1": {"text": ". Between March 4 and March 26 2020, 101 patients with COVID-19 were referred to palliative care, most frequently for end of life care or symptom control. Referrals rapidly increased from the first (n=2) to the fourth week (n=51). 64 patients were men, the median age was 82 [72-89]. The Elixhauser Comorbidity Index was 6 [2-10];the most common comorbidities were hypertension (54), diabetes (36) and dementia (31). 76 patients had been admitted with COVID-19 and 25 were existing inpatients who developed COVID-19; median [IQR] days from admission to referral were 2[1][2][3][4][5][6] and 16 for these groups respectively. At the time of referral, most patients (n=95) were receiving ward-based care, with six on high-dependency or intensive care units.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF2": {"text": "Demographic
