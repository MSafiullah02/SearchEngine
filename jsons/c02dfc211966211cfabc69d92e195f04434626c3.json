Relatively successful development in capitalist Southeast Asia followed a common process of overcoming postcolonial weaknesses that included a dependence on the production and export of primary commodities, a vulnerability to declining terms of trade, the vicissitudes of non-autonomous export-reliant growth, and a persistent foreign domination of key economic sectors. As Southeast Asian NIEs (barring Singapore) traversed a path of commodity diversification, openness to foreign direct investment (FDI), and incorporation into the 'new international division of labour', their pro-US Cold War alignments spared them potentially horrific destruction, of the type and scale visited upon Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. If anything, being firmly placed in the American orbit permitted the anti-communist countries of Southeast Asia to profit economically from the hot wars in Indochina.",

In bad times, the Southeast Asian NIEs did not sink to the truly wretched level of disastrous postcolonial experiences.

First was the 'peculiar arc of the Cold War in the region' because of which 'Washington made every effort to create loyal, capitalistically prosperous, authoritarian, and anti-communist regimes' (Anderson 1998b: 300) . Second was the 'accident of the region's geographical propinquity to Japan', which led to Japan's becoming Southeast Asia's 'single most important external investor . . . both as extractor of natural resources . . . and in industrial and infrastructural development'. A third condition of possibility was, 'ironically enough . . . [the] Maoist project of building a mighty autarchic, socialist economy outside the global capitalist order [that] kept China from playing a significant economic role in, or in competition with Southeast Asia until the middle 1980s' (Anderson 1998b: 301-2) . Finally, the opening of post-WWII economic opportunities and practices of postcolonial discrimination against their 'overseas Chinese' (in various ways and to different extents) served to 'encourage people of Chinese ancestry to concentrate their energies and ambitions in the private commercial sector', effectively making the Chinese minority the real domestic motor of the 'miracle' (Anderson 1998b: 304-5 ).",

Consequently, capitalist Southeast Asia no longer retained its previous favoured status in the USA's strategic calculations. Japan's regional economic preeminence was no longer assured because of its internal decline and external challenges. China, however, had 'emerged' or 'opened up' or 'returned', reversing the 'extraordinary sequestration from the global market of the greatest power in Asia' (Anderson 1998b: 302) , with a vengeance, it might be said. In other words, the historical conditions that favoured Southeast Asian growth had begun to recede before global financial pressures combined with domestic mismanagement to terminate what some observers had imagined would be inexorable economic advance (Anderson 1998b: 304) .",

Two decades after the 1997 crisis, however, none of them has attained the developed status their leaders had craved and which would be akin to a 'second Asian miracle' (Pempel and Tsunekawa 2015: 3) . On the contrary, standard indicators seem to suggest that these economies are mired in middle-income mediocrity or at risk of losing their competitiveness. Unlike Northeast Asia (except China, then, and North Korea still), which had acquired its advanced status in the era of favourable regional conditions, Southeast Asia (except Singapore) had been 'developing' somewhat impressively but stopped short of becoming 'developed'. Has the historic moment for Southeast Asia to replicate Northeast Asia's success in late industrialisation passed? The answer is partly positive and partly negative.",

The USA-backed international trade regime under the World Trade Organization (WTO) reduced exceptional treatment for developing countries on import restriction, export promotion, quota allocation, and property rights. These countries now find it more difficult to privilege firms located within their borders to foster national economic development. However, a more competitive global economy does not make the failure of developing economies inevitable. For instance, Aseema Sinha (2016) vividly analyses how the pressure of trade liberalisation under the WTO served to revitalise Indian pharmaceutical and textile industries. In both cases, the private sector in India was highly resistant to liberalisation, but WTO obligations strengthened the influence of reformers in the state and forced the private sector to change its preference. Entering the twenty-first century, the Indian pharmaceutical industry strategically turned to specialising in the production and marketing of generic medicines and boosted its investment in product development. Likewise, to prepare for the abolition of the multi-fibre agreement expected in 2005, India's textile industry changed its strategy drastically from sheltering under state protection to seeking export promotion and international competitiveness. To this end, firms in the industry increased R&D expenditure and extended backward and forward linkages. The two industries are now highly successful. (Sinha's analysis interestingly shows that these changes were led by reformers in the state who built coalitions of new winners and overcame the resistance of losers.)",

As early as 2009, he contended that Thailand's economy faced slowing growth. He did not use the term, 'middle-income trap', but 'uneven development' to characterise Thailand's success in transitioning to a non-traditional multi-sector economy without industrial upgrading. In principle, industrial upgrading must involve gains in productivity and productive innovation that allow an economy to shift from lower value-added to higher value-added sectors. For successful industrial upgrading, technological capacities of local firms must be enhanced and linkages among them established. This is achieved by solving collective action problems, such as free-riding, high transaction costs, and distributive conflicts. Doner cautioned, however, that only systemic pressures from external and internal crises can compel top state leaders to build institutions that overcome collective action problems and coordinate interests among domestic stakeholders (especially private firms). It was precisely the lack of persistent systemic pressures that caused Thailand's failure to respond effectively to its problem of uneven development (Doner 2009 ).",

They argue that a country must build an 'upgrading coalition' to escape the middle-income trap because improved technological education, enhanced R&D investment, and adequate infrastructure will require institutional reforms that ensure appropriate and trustworthy distribution or redistribution of costs and benefits. Without such a coalition and institutions, private firms would be reluctant to bear financial burdens for common goals while households hesitate to invest in children's education. However, Doner and Schneider observe that coalition-building faces many path-dependent obstacles. For instance, past cheap labour-based development, predicated on politically and socially weak labour, weakens current labour pressure for upgrading. Moreover, as the economy develops, the disparity between formal and informal sectors has expanded, while employee-employer divisions have intensified to such an extent that the political process, now marked by populism and clientelism, lowers collective pressures for industrial upgrading.",

The political repercussions continue to be felt in Southeast Asia. Indonesia's presidential election of 2014 suggested that its post-crisis politics has settled into a stable democratic mode after the overthrow of Soeharto and his New Order regime. The same cannot be said for Thailand and Malaysia. Thailand has witnessed several coups, two military and others judicial, that overthrew not just the Thaksin Shinawatra government in 2006 but every subsequent elected government for being allied to the deposed prime minister. In Malaysia, two consecutive general elections (in 2008 and 2013) inflicted heavy losses on the ruling coalition that lost the popular vote for the first time in 2013.",

A fourth Southeast Asian country, the Philippines, has had its political crises, too (although those were not attributable to repercussions of the 1997 crisis). Joseph Estrada, elected President in 1998, was forced out of office by a combination of an inconclusive impeachment, hostile mass demonstrations, and the withdrawal of military support. His successor, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, was beset by mass protests, a small army mutiny, and plots by other military groups to overthrow her. Like current Indonesian politics, Filipino politics appeared to have stabilised with the election of Benigno Aquino III as president in 2010. However, with the advent of Rodrigo Duterte's presidency in 2016, Filipino democracy may be undermined by the executive's illiberal and authoritarian measures.",

The scope to manoeuvre for an individual state is generally said to have narrowed in the current, highly globalised and competitive economy.

            "text": "The oligarchies of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand have socially evolved from specific historical and national origins. The Filipino oligarchy was rooted in vast landholdings during late colonial times. The oligarchs became adept at controlling a system of electoral representation which, 'adapted to the ambitions and social geography of the mestizo nouveaux riches' (Anderson 1998a: 201) , allowed them to move 'from private wealth to state power, from provincial bossism to national hegemony' (Anderson 1998a: 213) . The oligarchy of Thailand was formed from the elite power centers located within the military, the bureaucracy, and big businesses but were socially and ideologically placed under a constitutional, yet independently wealthy monarchy. Oligarchy came later in Indonesia where 'a system of power relations that enable[d] the concentration of wealth and authority and its collective defense' was constituted 'at a time of growth and market capitalism during the New Order' (Hadiz and Robison 2014: 37) . Here, oligarchic composition underwent a politically significant ethnic change with the emergence of a pribumi, an 'indigenous' but, for all purposes and intents, non-Chinese, component. The promotion of an ethnically comparable Bumiputera dimension to oligarchy in Malaysia was made part of state policy. Through state regulation, investment, and sponsorship that systematically began from 1970, the oligarchy was reconstituted from its earlier postcolonial form of an ethnic division of power between the Malay political elite and the (largely) Chinese economic elite. These oligarchies have also moved along different paths to economic and political dominance. However, it seems to be generally accepted that oligarchy as an embodiment of a 'fusion of political authority and economic power' (Hadiz and Robison 2014: 37) has been the source of political tensions in recent Southeast Asian politics. A common problem arising from the exercise of 'the power and politics of extreme wealth concentration' (Winters 2014: 12) has been the entrenchment of 'political capitalism', 'booty capitalism', 'crony capitalism', and so onso to speak, 'bastardised' deviations from the ideal form of regulated but free market capitalism. Hence, oligarchy in Southeast Asia (except Singapore) has been intimately associated with many kinds of 'predatory' and 'rent-seeking' activities.",

When Soeharto's dictatorship ended, a competitive electoral system was installed but expectations of liberal democracy were not realised. Instead, an 'expansion of costly electoral politics [had] facilitated the ascendance of business elites who [could] use their capital to pursue legislative positions and Cabinet posts that were previously limited' (Fukuoka 2013: 59) . Effectively, therefore, democratisation, including vigorous electoral exercises, did not eliminate a corrupt and unfair fusion of wealth and power but changed 'the old form of accommodation between the ruling politico-bureaucrats and the business elites' (Fukuoka 2012: 87) . The transition from dictatorship to democracy, moreover, produced a 'more chaotic electoral ruling oligarchy' that exercised power with fewer constraints (Winters 2014: 17) .",

Instead, they sought the production of niche products and services and the exploitation and processing of natural resources. In Thaksin's Thailand, the government actively targeted specific sectors for national development, but this intention was not matched by the installation of stern mechanisms to enforce, monitor, and evaluate the outcomes of those policies (Chapter 10, this volume).

In contrast, Thailand's once well-known competitive clientelism (Doner and Ramsay 2000) was reshaped into centralised clientelism under Thaksin. However, Thaksin's centralising tendencies and monopolistic politics drove his opponents and disadvantaged forces into forming an alliance that brought his rule to an abrupt and early end (Veerayooth and Hewison 2016).

Nationalism had raised mass expectations of what decolonisation should mean, while developmentalism met mass demands for socio-economic improvement. Thus, nationalism and developmentalism became state projects connected by fundamental communitarian concerns, as was implicit in the elite proffering of 'Asian values' in the heyday of East Asian triumphalism (Khoo 1999). Much of that was wrecked by 'globalisation' in the guise of the 'Washington consensus' and the power of financial markets. Populism, populist movements, and populists are notoriously difficult to define precisely because of the many variations in their meanings and characteristics in different national and local settings. Still, populism emerged as an alternative ideological current in the gap left by the 1997 crisis. As Southeast Asian political figures challenged discredited regimes or leaders, those figures and the movements they led refurbished nationalism, invoked communitarianism, and appealed to 'localism'. Thus, 'Gus Dur' (Abdurrahman Wahid) in Indonesia, Thaksin Shinawatra in Thailand, 'Erap' (Joseph Estrada) in the Philippines, and even Anwar Ibrahim in Malaysia espoused populist notions suited to their own political environments, in a paradoxical manner familiar to populism.",

On the other hand, populist rhetoric could be politically quite divisive in two senses.

Consequently, they could provoke severe reactions from the oligarchy, including firms whose participation is necessary for the implementation of a successful upgrading strategy.

It has been said that Thaksin, who was deposed by a military coup in 2006, had 'connected with the \"informal masses\" of Thailand's electoral heartlands in the north and northeast' and 'also mobilised an inchoate \"new capitalist\" sentiment that was oppositional to the established order and its attendant politics of prostration before the semidivinity of the monarchy and representatives' (Connors 2008: 481 ). Yet perhaps Thaksin's threat was 'not so much ideological as it was a visceral assault on the longstanding and compromised relationship between authoritarian privilege in the palace and military and emergent liberal forms of politics' (Connors 2008: 481) . To that extent, 'the unconscious logic of that [populist] challenge was overwhelming: the combination of a uniquely brazen, self-manifesting political leader, a hungry electorate, long denied economic and social benefits, and a class of political and business entrepreneurs, emerged to erode the hierarchic conventions of Thai politics' (Connors 2008: 481) .",

It may not be a historical accident, therefore, that Thailand, where Southeast Asia's developmental projects unravelled first, has been the site of the most protracted and deadly political battles between unforeseen alignments of oligarchic insecurities, middle-class conservatism, and populist grievances, virtually all of which were let loose by the 1997 crisis. The military coup mounted against Thaksin after he had been prime minister for only five and a half years signalled the ebb of the populism which rose with him. Yet, until a second military coup in 2014 crushed it, populism remained a powerful force that repeatedly brought Thaksin's allies to power.

Among other things, the NEM proposed to quicken economic transformation from low valueadded sectors supported by unskilled cheap labour to high valueadded sectors with innovative productivity-enhancement capabilities. The NEM even considered introducing unemployment insurance and a minimum wage system. Fierce opposition to these proposals was quickly raised by private sector organisations such as Malaysian Employers' Federation, Small and Medium Industry Associations of Malaysia, Malaysian Agricultural Producers Association, and the Malaysian International Chambers of Commerce and Industry. In response, the government shelved the idea of unemployment insurance. Only because the ruling coalition faced a serious electoral challenge from the opposition (the original source of the minimum wage proposal), Najib announced in April 2012 that private sector firms must guarantee a minimum wage (determined by the government) for their employees, including foreign migrant workers. Pressed by the private sector once more, the government again retreated, permitting a non-implementation 'grace period' (of up to one year) and allowing firms employing foreign workers to be exempted from certain levies. In other words, the NEM's aim to discourage the use of cheap foreign workers was largely undone (Suzuki 2014: 152-61) .",

Thailand and Malaysia have shown a strong preference for this strategy. However, the time when an industry could replace another by the logic of product cycles (Vernon 1966) has long gone. Owing to the rapid development of communication and transportation technologies as well as the spread of modular product architecture, the production process in an industry can now be fragmented into many segments and located in different parts of the world (Yeung 2016: 1, 5) . Logistics and marketing can also be distributed to different parts of the world. Locational decisions of foreign lead firms largely depend on the availability of local human, technological, and institutional resources. For Coe and Yeung (2015: 173) , however, technological downgrading (not upgrading) may sometimes bring comparative advantage to certain localities because it matches production for lowerincome markets. However, to sustain economic growth, a middle-income country must obtain higher technology portions of global production networks located in its territory. This will require the technological upgrading of local suppliers and labour force, a task that has not been easy for Thailand and Malaysia. Upgrading in Thailand has been undertaken in many sectors, including the hard disc drive (HDD) sub-sector of the electronics industry, the automobile industry, and the food processing industry (Chapter 6, this volume). However, since the electronics and automobile sectors are dominated by MNCs (Chapter 2, this volume), the successful transplantation of high value-added processes to Thailand has required special efforts by the state and the private sector. Intarakumnerd (Chapter 6, this volume) describes in detail how sector-specific intermediaries have striven to link firms to each other and to related agencies to improve productivity and competitiveness. The Hard Disc Drive Institute (HDDI) is a good example of how such collaboration was accomplished. The HDDI, consisting of government agencies, MNCs, and local research institutes (universities), set up university-industry linkages, testing laboratories, joint training programs, and collaborative R&D projects. This contributed to upgrading the technological capability of the whole HDD cluster. The Thailand Automotive Institute (TAI) is HDDI's counterpart in the automobile industry although its function is general rather than to serve specific sub-sectors and its impacts are yet to be seen.",

Unlike Thai automotive and electronic products, moreover, Malaysia's manufactured rubber products have been developed with minimum direct participation by foreign corporations although they are important buyers of products from Malaysia's original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). The pioneers of technological upgrading in rubber manufacture were technician-entrepreneurs of ethnic Chinese origin who own, operate, and manage global firms such as Top Glove and the Kossan Group. Significantly, the resilience and dynamism of ethnic Chinese entrepreneurs, Anderson's fourth condition of possibility, still applies with remarkable results in rubber-based manufacturing in Malaysia. Private sector initiatives also benefitted from a long history of substantial public sector support in many areas of the rubber industry, including R&D. Such support was originally provided by the Rubber Research Institute Malaysia (RRIM), founded in 1925 to develop the rubber industry. Presently, the state's principal agency for supporting the rubber industry is the Malaysian Rubber Board (MRB), which, in 1998, took over the responsibilities of RRIM. Drawing on RRIM's vast research experience and accumulated knowledge of rubber and its production, the MRB laboratory helped develop high-quality medical gloves that met new and stringent standards of the USA and Europe. Top Glove and the Kossan Group, in particular, benefitted from MRB support during the early and intermediate stages of their development.",

Its palm oil industry is widely acknowledged as a successful implementation of natural resource processing strategy (Rasiah 2006; Oikawa 2015) . Beginning as the world's largest exporter of crude palm oil, the industry progressed to exporting refined palm oil in the mid-1970s. By the 1990s, it had advanced further downstream to produce intermediate goods such as vegetable oils and fats and oleo-chemical products. As with rubber, the state played a key role in the palm oil industry's early and intermediate stages of development. Through consciously designed policies and huge investments, the state facilitated land clearance for new plantations, the cultivation of new and higher-yielding oil palm varieties, the provision of physical infrastructure, and the construction of oil-extraction plants. The extent of the state's involvement may be gauged from its provision of social infrastructure to raise the living standards of settler communities of statemanaged oil palm plantations, on the one hand, and the use of differential export taxes to assist the producers of palm oil products, on the other. Thus, the palm oil industry presently covers the whole value chain, including its higher value-added segments. For a long time, the palm oil firms were largely dependent on imported foreign technology but they have since adapted the technology to suit domestic conditions better. The industry faces two major problems today. One is its heavy reliance on a low-paid migrant labour force in the upstream activities of cultivation and care of oil palms and harvesting of fruits. A second problem is the emergence of Indonesia as a serious competitor, often with the aid of expatriate Malaysian expertise. Addressing both problems satisfactorily will require the Malaysian palm oil industry to extend and strengthen technological upgrading to obtain higher productivity gains.",

In the post-Soeharto era, business groups reduced their manufacturing activities to ease their problem of bad loans and to operate in a somewhat laissez-faire policy environment (Chapter 3, this volume). These business groups have turned to the natural resource sectors of plantation agriculture and mining to take advantage of a commodity boom to regain their economic strength. (They have also moved into new domestic services, such as telecommunications, hospitals, education, media, and logistics.) The government of President Yudhoyono, however, considered a national development strategy essential for raising Indonesia to developed status and in May 2011 launched its Masterplan for the Acceleration and Expansion of Indonesian Economic Development 2011-25. A key strategy of this masterplan was greater extraction of value from natural resources. Even before it announced the masterplan, the government had promulgated a new law on mineral and coal mining that prohibited the export of raw mineral resources. Implemented in 2014, the new law stipulated that taxes on raw mineral exports would only be reduced when the degree of mineral processing increased. Prasetyawan (Chapter 9, this volume) gives a detailed account of the implementation of the law that sought to redress an unplanned outcome of post-Soeharto decentralisation, namely, the excessive issuance of mining licenses by local governments that had been newly granted broad authority and increased fiscal resources. This conduct of local governments, which usually wanted to obtain political contributions in money, neglected economic and environmental feasibility. The state had to contend with resource-extracting MNCs that fiercely opposed the law. In the copper mining sector, the government was forced to make many concessions (including the postponement of the export ban) to the two MNCs that controlled close to 100 per cent of Indonesia's copper exports.",

Malaysia's medical glove industry is an excellent example of niche product development. The now globally competitive Top Glove and the Kossan Group seized the opportunities created by an unanticipated surge in the global demand for high-quality, thin but strong, disposable examination and surgical gloves. The demand for the specialised glove began suddenly with the worldwide concern over health and safety standards that arose in the wake of epidemics such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and avian flu. Of course, new market opportunities do not guarantee success for new ventures. The Malaysian companies which became globally competitive blended earnest efforts to upgrade their technological capability with the ready availability of natural rubber as raw material, a tremendously valuable experience of rubber production and research, and unfailing state support in many areas. A niche product-oriented strategy has also been successfully pursued in Thailand's increasingly innovative food processing industry. The detailed analysis by Suehiro (Chapter 2, this volume) of the post-crisis reorganisation of family businesses shows that many sold their manufacturing firms to foreign corporations but increasingly specialised in agro-industries and service sectors such as tourism, modern retail, housing, hospital and medical services, and entertainment. The development of such sectors is crucially dependent on a deep knowledge of natural resources, domestic markets, business networks, and local cultures. Thus, these may be considered niche sectors in which domestic firms enjoy competitive advantages over foreign ones. As with Malaysia's rubber manufacturing, Thailand's food processing industry made good use of its easy access to local raw materials. Successful family business firms, such as the Charoen Pokphand (CP) Group and Thai Union Frozen, continually undertook product and process innovation in their factories to produce internationally competitive processed foods (Chapter 6, this volume). As a measure of their innovative capability, those groups have gone beyond OEM production to market some of their products with their own brand names. In some cases, they developed a global reach by buying firms in neighbouring countries and even in some high-income countries and becoming MNCs themselves (Chapter 2, this volume). Even so, Thai-owned brands remain far fewer than foreign-owned brands and many Thai firms function only as OEMs. With special reference to the processed seafood industry, Intarakumnerd (Chapter 6, this volume) warns that the Thai seafood industry would have to offer more sophisticated and branded products in the face of growing competition from lower-cost producers such as Vietnam and Indonesia.",

Together with the enormous amount of remittances made by Filipinos working overseas, the BPO sector has contributed to the Philippines' relatively high growth in the past decade. Not unlike Malaysia's rubber manufacturing and palm oil processing industry, and Thailand's food processing industry, which directly or indirectly benefit from low-cost labour, the BPO sector relies excessively on its domestic cheap labour. Raquiza (Chapter 8, this volume) has warned that if opportunities to work overseas grow, the domestic BPO sector may be deprived of its essential English-speaking human resource. To address this potential threat, the Philippines should raise workers' skills and continually improve the social infrastructure that maintains the BPO sector.",

Even in upper middle-income countries such as Malaysia and Thailand, many firms have made no effort to wean themselves off the dependence on cheap labour. Although some of that labour is domestic in origin, Malaysia (Chapter 5, this volume) and Thailand (Chapter 2, this volume) have seen an influx of unskilled and often undocumented migrant workers from neighbouring low-income countries such as Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, and Myanmar. For Malaysia, a chronic and massive dependence on low-skilled, lowwage foreign labour only pushes the economy towards premature deindustrialisation and obstructs more innovative and higher value-added economic activities (Chapter 5, this volume). Likewise, in Thailand almost two million migrants from neighbouring low-income countries were mostly unskilled workers employed in sectors such as construction, low-skill services, agriculture, fishery, food processing, and garments (Chapter 2, this volume; Yamada 2014: 142-3). In a different form, labour is also a critical issue for the Philippines. It ranks among the world's top remittance-recipient countries and more than one in four households benefit from remittances. This bestows ambiguous reward, however, since state institutions become less motivated to promote productive activities while a sizeable part of the domestic workforce leaves the country (Chapter 8, this volume).",

That does not imply that deep reforms of management and technical improvement are not important. Nor does it mean that the cheap labour advantage will last long. Fujita (Chapter 4, this volume) analyses the results of reforms implemented in two major Vietnamese state-managed enterprise groups (Vinatex and VEAM). In Vietnam, where the private sector is still small and weak, the state must lead in implementing different reforms to take advantage of opportunities in the global market. The Vietnamese government had conducted reforms, including equitising and streamlining its SOEs. Certain SOE-affiliated firms are allowed considerable autonomy, including taking decisions to enter joint-venture partnerships with foreign companies. Thus, firms producing garments and motorcycle parts and components have succeeded in expanding their businesses through deeper integration with the global value chain. Their success was not solely based on cheap labour but came from earnest efforts to raise management and technical capabilities to levels that met the requirements of foreign partners. However, Vietnam remains weaker in technology-intensive and skill-based sectors as is evident from the great difficulties faced by Vinatex in the upstream segment (spinning, weaving, and dying) and VEAM in the production of trucks and agricultural machinery (Chapter 4, this volume).",

Some of their domestic businesses, private and/or state-owned, strategically adapted to post-crisis and other unanticipated conditions that allowed them to chart new paths of growth. Some of those paths ran through learning processes of technological upgrading in resource-based manufacturing, niche product development in natural resource sectors, and the provision of services by leveraging on the advantages of special segments of human resources. Part of the support for those new business ventures came from state and private sector collaboration in domestic R&D or market promotion.

The deeper problem is whether the present modes of development can reliably sustain current rates of income improvement.

Besides, the sources of cheap labour will be exhausted in middle-income Southeast Asia as domestic wages rise and the influx of migrant labour runs into different problems.",

If an acknowledgement of the inherent limitations in current development strategies can be translated into firm policy, it could form the basis for institutionalising sorely needed reform. That may, in turn, produce a more equitable and less divisive distribution of the socioeconomic costs and benefits of upgrading. If not, reform will only be offered piecemeal out of self-interest by ruling elites when they have no choice but to appease populist pressures. It is here that Southeast Asian countries run into non-economic and nontechnological dimensions of the middle-income trap. It is where the wise calculations of entrepreneurial initiatives and economic policies end and the unplanned interventions of deep socio-political factors begin.",
