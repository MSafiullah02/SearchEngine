Gono et al. found that a serum ferritin cut-off value of 1600 ng/mL was the best indicator of survival among 14 anti-MDA5 antibody-associated ILD patients [6]. In their study, no death was reported during a 60-month follow-up among patients with ferritin levels < 500 ng/mL. Similar results were recently published by Fujiki et al. [18]. Although poor survival has been reported [1, 2], the clinical outcome of our patient was excellent. Interestingly, her serum ferritin levels were always < 500 ng/mL.",
