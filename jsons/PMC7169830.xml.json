Despite state\u2010of\u2010art technologies in water treatment processes, waterborne outbreaks are still a critical challenge globally.

Somatic phage group contains a big family of lytic phages with single or double\u2010stranded DNA genomes (Hodgson, Torok, & Turnbull, 2017). These bacteriophages attach the coliform cell wall as the specific host, which may infect warm\u2010blooded animals and duplicate in the gastrointestinal tract. Similar to the somatic coliphages, both F\u2010RNA and Bacteroides phages replicate in the gastrointestinal tract of mammals. However, Bacteroides only survive and reproduce under anaerobic condition with specific nutritional requirements in the gastrointestinal tract. Besides, F\u2010RNA and Bacteroides have other different features. For instance, F\u2010RNA phages are single\u2010stranded RNA (ssRNA), while Bacteroides phages contain double\u2010stranded DNA (dsDNA) genomes with long contractile tails. In general, F\u2010RNA phages, also known as F\u2010specific phages, are considered as effective indicators of enteric virus in most environments and treatment processes. Comparing somatic coliphage with F\u2010specific coliphage, Jofre, Lucena, Blanch, and Muniesa (2016) studied various perspectives, including their population in different pollution sources, treatment methods, and persistence in different environments. Under most of the circumstances, somatic phages outnumbered the F\u2010specific phages. Jofre and colleagues detected about 5 \u00d7 106 to 107 plaque\u2010forming units (PFUs) per 100 ml of somatic phages in the raw municipal wastewater, while F\u2010specific phages were significantly lower with 104 to 106 PFUs per 100 ml. Furthermore, somatic phages were reported predominate in both surface water and groundwater. Besides, after the secondary treatment, both bacteriophages could be eliminated by 50%\u201399.9%, with 103 to 105 PFUs per 100 ml of somatic phages and 102 to 5 \u00d7 104 PFUs per 100 ml of F\u2010specific phages remained in secondary effluent.",

Some researchers (Jofre et al., 2016) considered coliphages correlated with human viruses and health risk, while others (McMinn, Ashbolt, & Korajkic, 2017) declined the statement. McMinn et al. (2017) considered Enterococci phages as potential fecal indicators, surviving in both fresh and marine water in tropical and subtropical regions. Except for Enterococci phages, both somatic phages and F\u2010specific phages were detected in freshwater and marine water. Notably, somatic phages significantly outnumbered the F\u2010specific phages. However, further investigation is essential to define Enterococci phages as indicator of fecal pollution due to the limited studied regions. They also indicated that somatic phages and F\u2010specific phages had the highest concentrations than any other bacteriophages, such as Bacteroides and Enterococci phages. Moreover, they determined the removal rate in the wastewater treatment process and showed somatic phages, F\u2010specific coliphages, and Bacteroides phages had similar reduction, while fecal coliform and E. coli as fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) showed significantly higher reduction than bacteriophages. Therefore, it is concluded that bacteriophages can act as a robust surrogate for evaluating human viral pathogen removal via wastewater treatment. Dias, Ebdon, and Taylor (2018) detected FIB, bacteriophages (somatic, F\u2010RNA, and B. fragilis), and viral pathogens in activated sludge and trickling filter systems, and they also concluded that FIB was removed more efficiently than phages but noticed that FIB was less effective to indicate the removal of viral pathogens in the systems than phages.

Comparing with Enterococcus population, F + coliphage was discovered to be better associated with gastrointestinal illness. Further, it was shown that F + RNA coliphage Genotype II was significantly related to gastrointestinal illness in one of the water bodies. Yamahara, Sassoubre, Goodwin, and Boehm (2012) evaluated the decay rate of F + coliphage, which indicated relatively higher than FIB or other pathogen indicators. They investigated the occurrence and persistence of FIB and pathogens from 53 California beaches by using qPCR as a culture\u2010independent method. From the collections of dry sand samples, F + coliphages showed a first\u2010order decay rate of 0.42/day, while other FIB and pathogens indicator resulted in much lower decay rate. Vijayavel et al.

In general, F + coliphage and Enterococcus were present at higher concentrations in wastewater, while low at rivers and harbors. In another study by Lee, Lee, Cho, Hur, and Ko (2011), F + coliphage was detected in 71 groundwater and five surface water samples in Korea. While these samples were associated with chicken and human feces contamination in groundwater, the surface water contained F + coliphage correlating with cows.

In this study, sensitivities, specificities, concentrations, and decay rates of mDNA and mtDNA were evaluated and it showed that majority of mDNA had lower sensitivities than mtDNA. In addition, mtDNA was shown to have relatively higher specificities (98%) compared to mDNA specificities (92%). Furthermore, the decay rate of DNA markers was evaluated in various temperatures, which showed a significant increase in the decay rate in higher temperature. In another study, Villemur, Imbeau, Vuong, Masson, and Payment (2015) extracted DNA from surface water samples of 82 watersheds to evaluate human, bovine and porcine mtDNA markers as well as Bacteroidales HF183 marker via PCR method.

They obtained water samples from a wastewater treatment plant in South Texas, and used BacHum and E. coli as fecal source tracking, along with human mtDNA as a direct marker. It was indicated that BacHum had correlations with coliforms at a correlation coefficient of 0.76. In addition to application of mtDNA as microbial source tracking marker in surface water and wastewater, mtDNA has indicated a potential as a microbial marker to detect fecal contaminations in stormwater or heavy rainfalls. Waso, Khan, and Khan (2018) successfully designed a novel mtDNA to target mtDNA Cytochrome b gene via mismatch amplification mutation assay (MAMA) with PCR that detected pigeon fecal contamination in the harvested rainfalls. The high host sensitivity (100%) and host specificity (96%) was obtained after screening all the fecal samples, which had an excellent performance based on the criteria of EPA. For newly designed MST markers, the standard established by EPA for host sensitivity and host specificity ise 80%. In addition, they analyzed the concurrence of pigeon mtDNA marker with other indicator organisms, including heterotrophic bacteria, E. coli, total coliforms, and fecal coliforms.

They concluded that concentration of HF183 in human fecal samples was 1,000\u2010fold more than the animal fecal samples. Also, Kirs and colleague compared the decay rate of HF183 with enterococci under sunlight and dark conditions and showed that the decay rate of HF183 was significantly lower than enterococci in sunlight, while the decay rate was very similar in the dark. Moreover, the sensitivity (80%) and specificity (78%) were detected relatively high for human samples, and therefore, Bacteroides can be applied to identify the origin of fecal pollution and waterborne pathogens. Marti et al. (2013) studied the relations among MST marker (Bacteroides), fecal bacteria indicators (FIB), and pathogens. They concluded that presence and absence of the Bacteroides marker were not correlated to FIB, but positively related to pathogens such as Cryptosporidium and Giardia. In another study conducted by Newton, VandeWalle, Borchardt, Gorelick, and McLellan (2011), Bacteroides as MST marker was used to evaluate chronic human sewage contamination in urban harbor. Their experimental results indicated that total Bacteroidales spp. were abundant in human fecal samples, which illustrated strong correlations with human fecal contamination. Besides, Bacteroidales spp. was detected frequently during combined\u2010sewer overflow periods comparing with dry seasons.",

            "text": "\nLachnospiraceae is another group of fecal anaerobic bacteria that occurs especially abundant in human sewage and has been explored as a microbial indicator for assessing water quality. McLellan and Eren (2014) investigated human fecal pollution indicators and showed over 75% of the fecal microbial community was associated with Lachnospiraceae. The comparison of sequence analysis of sewage samples in a study by Newton et al. (2011) resulted a human\u2010associated phylotype within Lachnospiraceae family. This phylotype, termed as Lachno2, closely related to Blautia genus was found to be the second most abundant fecal bacterial phylotype and was involved to assess chronic human sewage contamination in urban harbor. Close relationship between Bacteroides and Lachno2 confirmed the feasibility of using this indicator as an excellent candidate for host\u2010associated fecal indicator alternative to Bacteroides for determining human fecal pollution in surface water. In a recent study by Feng, Bootsma, and McLellan (2018), designated genetic markers, termed as Lachno3 and Lachno12, which dominate in V6 region, were evaluated to detect human and animal fecal pollution in urban water. These assays were assessed with fecal samples of cat, dog, pig, cow, and deer. Although both Lachno3 and Lachno12 markers were primary human\u2010associated, Lachno12 marker was detected at low levels in samples from dogs and cows, while Lachno3 marker was detected only in human fecal contamination or sewage. It is suggested that combination of multiple complimentary markers such as Lachno3 with lachno12 or HF183 might improve identification of human fecal pollution sources.",

Sequencing various regions in small subunit (SSU) rRNA as one of the major components in the microbial communities identifies signature microbial species that can serve as indicators for fecal or other pathogenic contamination, and therefore, NGS can provide high\u2010quality screen for sequences to evaluate human fecal and sewage pollutions. In a study conducted by Tan et al. (2015), V1 and V2 hypervariable regions of SSU rRNA were sequenced to detect pathogens in urban and agricultural watersheds along Santa Ana River, CA. In another study, Shrestha et al. (2017) used 16S rRNA gene NGS and detected Acinetobacter, Arcobacter, and Clostridium as possible pathogenic bacteria. As the same sample did not show any fecal indicator bacteria, they suggested the limitation of using only fecal indicator bacteria in evaluating water quality contaminated with pathogens. The pathogen diversity was evaluated by amplicon NGS in a study conducted by Cui, Fang, Huang, Dong, and Wang (2017). Genomic DNA from various samples was sequenced targeting the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene, and pathogenic species were identified by comparing the sequences with a reference database of human pathogenic bacteria.",

Therefore, detection and quantification of these pathogens in water bodies have become critical portions of water quality assessment. Microbial indicators have shown correlation with pathogens, and hence, they can be used as a surrogate to evaluate microbial quality in water bodies. However, many pathogens may not behave like fecal microbial indicators and no indicator has been developed for their presence. As database for these pathogens grows in future years, we may find microbial indicators specific to those pathogens of public health importance. Until then, combining various microbial indicators from different taxonomic groups may be required for better quantification and detecting co\u2010occurrence of the pathogens.",
