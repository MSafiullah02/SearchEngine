Importantly, the management of these patients seems to have been adequately matched to the severity of their symptoms, with a good availability of intensive care and a very high coverage of oxygen and antibiotics, including broad-spectrum ones.20, 28 Nosocomial infections, which in other settings may be an important cause of in-hospital mortality, appear to have played a moderate role in this series, as only about 14.2% of the patients (4/28) had an admission duration longer than 10 days.",

Similarly, under-nutrition, although not included in the final model because of being part of the outcome definition of the RISC score, was also found to be strongly associated with a higher likelihood of death, and was highly prevalent, affecting about a quarter of the recruited patients with a good outcome and almost half of those with a bad outcome. In recent years, Morocco has made important efforts to introduce programs for the prevention and management of childhood diseases, including the promotion of exclusive breastfeeding, supplementation of iron and vitamin A, and the introduction of anti-pneumonia vaccines, all of which may have an impact on the incidence of new malnutrition cases. However, malnutrition prevalence rates remain high in Morocco,25, 39 and unless adequately addressed, will continue to negatively affect the survival of patients with pneumonia.",

This does not limit the strength of our results, but, in our opinion, may express that in this setting their validity as prognostic markers appears less critical than in other settings. Our study suffers from further limitations, including the fact that it was conducted in an urban referral tertiary hospital with good accessibility to intensive care, a factor that may have influenced the outcome for some of these patients, thus underestimating the real impact that pneumonia may have in other less advantaged or more rural areas of the country.",
