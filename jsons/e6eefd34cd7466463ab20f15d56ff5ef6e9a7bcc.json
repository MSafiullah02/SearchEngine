As troponin, a biomarker of cardiac injury, often rises in hospitalized patients, its interpretation and actionability require careful consideration. Fulminant myocarditis due to direct viral infection can certainly occur, but patients with increased oxygen demands due to tachycardia and fever, and reduced oxygen delivery due to hypotension and hypoxemia can cause myocardial injury indirectly. Cytokines released during the acute infection can elicit activation of cells within pre-existing atherosclerotic lesions, augmenting thrombotic risk and risk of ischemic syndromes. Moreover, microvascular activation by cytokines can cause not only myocardial injury but harm other organ systems commonly involved in COVID-19 infections including the kidneys. Dealing with the immense challenge of COVID-19 disease, confronted with severely ill patients in dire straits with virtually no rigorous evidence base to guide our therapy, we must call upon our clinical skills and judgment. These touchstones can help guide us in selecting patients who might benefit from the advanced imaging and invasive procedures that present enormous logistical challenges in the current context. Lacking a robust evidence base, pathophysiologic reasoning can help guide our choices of therapy for individual clinical scenarios. We must exercise caution and extreme humility, as often plausible interventions fail when tested rigorously. But act today we must, and understanding the multiplicity of mechanisms of myocardial injury in COVID-19 infection will help us meet our mission unsupported by the comfort of strong data.",

Cardiologists as well as other practitioners who care for those with this virulent viral infection, and indeed the general public as To approach this question, we need to distinguish myocarditis due to infection of cardiac cells from myocardial ischemic injury. Flow embarrassment to the heart muscle can result from lesions in epicardial coronary arteries or in the heart's microvasculature. Cardiac ischemia can also arise from an imbalance between oxygen supply and demand, a type 2 acute coronary syndrome, a situation that can prevail in acute infections, particularly those that affect the lungs like COVID19. Several of these pathophysiologic pathways to myocardial ischemia may affect those without substantial or obstructive coronary artery atherosclerosis. Hence, the distinction between these various mechanisms has important clinical consequences. The need for arduous imaging studies and invasive evaluation may vary considerably in these different scenarios, an issue of great import in acute care facilities stretched to or beyond their limits during a pandemic with a readily contagious and virulent infectious agent such as COVID19. Considering the pathophysiologic paths to cardiac injury can inform judgement regarding the necessity of transport of severely ill patients and the performance invasive procedures. ",

Remote infections such as the severe pneumonitis that too commonly complicates COVID-19 can elicit an acute exacerbation of the chronic smoldering inflammation that characterizes coronary atherosclerotic lesions ( Figure 2 ). The inflammatory cells at a site of regional infection such as the lungs in COVID19 pneumonitis can produce cytokines such as interleukins (IL)-1 and -6, and tumor necrosis factor, mediators that not only propagate local inflammation but can enter the systemic circulation. Such circulating cytokines can stimulate macrophages within the plaque to augment local cytokine production and provoke an increase in tissue factor expression that renders lesions more thrombogenic. We have referred to this local response to systemic stimuli as an \"echo\" phenomenon. 4, 6 These same systemic cytokines can stimulate leukocyte adhesion molecule expression on the endothelial cells overlying established atheroma, boosting local recruitment of these inflammatory cells. These alterations in preexisting plaques can enhance their propensity to disrupt, be it by fibrous cap fissure or by superficial erosion, and provoke an acute coronary syndrome.",

The torrent of literature on this nascent topic contains clearcut descriptions of fulminant myocarditis in certain individuals 1, 2 , as ably reviewed in the State of the Art paper on cardiac involvement in COVID 19 by Atri and colleagues, \"COVID-19 for the Cardiologist: A State-of-the-Art Review of the Virology, Clinical Epidemiology, Cardiac and Other Clinical Manifestations and Potential Therapeutic Strategies\" in this issue of JACC: Basic to Translational Science.3 Indeed, the human myocardium can express the receptor that COVID-19 uses to infect host cells, angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), the counterregulatory cousin of the more familiar ACE-1. Thus, no doubt in some cases a viral myocarditis due to this agent can occur(Figure 1, far left). Yet, troponin rise seems nearly ubiquitous in patients requiring intensive care, an indication of cardiac involvement in many cases, and a marker of poor prognosis, as in many other circumstances. But can we, and should we, attribute all rises in troponin to direct myocardial infection by this virus?",

The summary report of this panel explicitly considered systemic infection and the triggering of acute coronary events and reviewed some of the possible mechanisms. 4 These considerations included cytokine responses to infection as activators of vascular cells and as inducers of the acute phase response with consequent heightened production of fibrinogen, the precursor of clots, and of endogenous inhibitors of fibrinolysis. More recent panels convened in conjunction the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute re-examined this issue and highlighted the differences between direct infection and secondary responses. 5 The COVID19 pandemic elevates these pathophysiologic considerations from theoretically interesting to a level of vital clinical importance. The paper by Atri et al. deals comprehensively with cardiac involvement. 3 This commentary and the accompanying illustrations place these considerations in the context of inflammation and vascular biology",

See the text for details. (Adapted from 5 ) Infection has multiple effects that may impinge on the cardiovascular system and provoke events. In addition to the aspects detailed in the previous figures, infection may predispose towards thrombosis and reduced fibrinolysis as explained in the text. The consequences of infection may also alter the function of macro-or micro-vascular endothelium and thus contribute to cardiovascular complications of COVID-19 disease. (From 5 )",
