Unfortunately, in severe patients with COVID-19, the disease progresses rapidly, and respiratory failure can occur within a short time, even leading to death. Early data from Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital showed that 61.1% of patients in ICU had respiratory failure, 44.4% had arrhythmia, and 30.6% had a shock [11].
