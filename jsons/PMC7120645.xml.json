            "text": "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), the most common form of the idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs), is a progressive, irreversible, life-threatening disease of unknown etiology. IPF occurs primarily in older adults, is limited to the lungs, and is associated with the histopathological and/or radiological patterns of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) [1\u20133]. Many IPF patients have a relatively slow clinical course; however, some patients experience acute respiratory deterioration. Patients with IPF have a poor prognosis (median survival is approximately 3 years) with considerable individual variability in the clinical course of disease [4, 5]. Options for the treatment of IPF are limited, and lung transplantation is the only curative therapy. To prompt consideration for lung transplantation, the importance of identifying patients with increased risk of mortality within 2 years has been mentioned [1, 6].",

Patients that are older and male have been reported as having a worse prognosis in some but not all studies. Longitudinal change in physiology is clearly an important predictor of mortality in IPF. A decline in FVC over 6 or 12 months has been reliably associated with decreased survival [7\u201310]. A decline in DLco has also been associated with decreased survival [9, 10]. Some studies have suggested that desaturation during the 6-min walk test is a marker for an increased risk of mortality [11, 12].",

These include predicting patients at risk for developing IPF (predisposition biomarkers), diagnosing patients with IPF (screening or diagnostic biomarkers), monitoring clinical course and therapeutic effects (monitoring or therapeutic biomarkers), and predicting prognosis and evaluating disease severity (prognostic and staging biomarkers). In addition, serological biomarkers are preferred because they do not require an effort from patients, can be reproducible, and are less invasive. To date, there are no biomarkers used worldwide in the clinical setting. Several candidate biomarkers have been mentioned, namely, surfactant protein (SP)-A, SP-D, KL-6, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, MMP-7, and CC chemokine ligand-18 (CCL18) [13\u201318]. In Japan, SP-A, SP-D, and KL-6 are commonly used as serum markers of interstitial pneumonia, including IPF, in clinical settings, with empirical data accumulated for the last 10 years. We extensively discuss this issue in this article based on accumulated experience.",

The collectins possess four major structural domains: (1) an amino terminus containing a cysteine involved in interchain disulfide bond formation, (2) a collagen-like domain consisting of Gly-X-Y repeats, (3) a neck domain containing a short hydrophobic stretch of amino acids and amphipathic helix, and (4) a lectin domain (a carbohydrate recognition domain, CRD). The collagenous domains promote trimerization, and the trimers undergo disulfide cross-linking to form higher-order oligomers. SP-A forms a bouquet-like octadecamer assembled from six trimers, whereas SP-D forms a cruciform dodecamer assembled from four trimers (Fig. 5.1) [19\u201322]. The monomeric molecular mass of SP-A and SP-D is 30\u201336 kD and 43 kD, respectively. The molecular mass of the SP-A octadecamer is reported to be approximately 650 kD by gel filtration analysis and that of the SP-D dodecamer is approximately 540 kD [23].\n",

            "text": "Pulmonary collectins have been shown to function as host defense lectins [30]. The proteins have been shown to bind gram-negative bacteria including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae, gram-positive organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, fungi including Aspergillus and Candida, and other pathogens including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Pneumocystis carinii, and influenza virus. SP-A is thought to bind to pathogens via its CRD [31, 32]. The in vivo studies clearly reveal that pulmonary collectins are involved in bacterial clearance. SP-A binds to and enhances the phagocytosis of bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Haemophilus influenzae by alveolar macrophages [33]. SP-D also binds to microorganisms and aids opsonization and phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages [34]. Pulmonary collectins have been shown to function as inflammatory modulators in the lung. Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and peptidoglycan, are potent stimulators of inflammatory cytokine secretion. Pattern recognition receptors, including Toll-like receptor (TLR) and CD14, are responsible for the recognition and signaling of PAMPs and cytokine production. A previous study demonstrated the different actions of SP-A for distinct serotypes of LPS. SP-A inhibits the macrophage-derived TNF-\u03b1 secretion induced by smooth LPS, which is a complete structural form of LPS. On the other hand, SP-A does not attenuate or even augment TNF-\u03b1 secretion elicited by rough LPS, which does not express O-specific antigen and is an SP-A ligand. These distinct effects of SP-A occur through the direct interaction of SP-A with CD14 [35]. SP-A also inhibits TNF-\u03b1 secretion by gram-positive bacteria via the interaction with SP-A and TLR2, which recognizes peptidoglycan, a major cell wall component of gram-positive bacteria [36]. Taken together, lung collectins exhibit both inflammatory and anti-inflammatory functions. These distinct activities depend on the ligand-binding specificities of collectins.",

In the normal lung tissue, it is produced in alveolar type II cells and respiratory bronchiolar epithelial cells and is weakly expressed in basal cells of the terminal bronchial epithelium [41, 42]. KL-6 can be cut and released from the cell surface through the action of TNF-\u03b1 converting enzyme (TACE; also called a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 [ADAM17]) and potentially ADAM9 [40, 43]. In addition, some soluble KL-6 may result from alternative splicing. In a transfection study using breast cancer cells, MUC1 prevented E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell and cell surface adhesion [44]. Another study demonstrated that anti KL-6 mAb mediates capping of MUC1 and restores E-cadherin, leading to inhibition of tumor proliferation [45]. These results suggested that KL-6 may be a target molecule of cancer therapy. In relation to the pathological role of lung fibrosis, previous reports have shown that KL-6 is one of the chemotactic factors for fibroblasts and has both proliferative and antiapoptotic effects for fibroblasts [38, 46]. These results indicate that KL-6 may stimulate fibrotic processes in interstitial lung diseases and support the theory that KL-6 is one of the key molecules involved in the intra-alveolar fibrotic process of pulmonary fibrosis.",

            "text": "Although surfactant proteins had been believed to be solely in the lungs, Chida et al. reported that surfactant proteins could be found in the sera of patients with RDS using a competitive ELISA with polyclonal antibody against SP-A or SP-B. A positive result for SP-A was obtained in four infants with RDS at 1 week of age and one surfactant-treated infant. All sera obtained at 2 months of age were negative for SP-A and SP-B. The specificities of antibodies and the presence of surfactant proteins in serum were not demonstrated in this study [47]. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with two mAbs (PC6 and PE10) to human SP-A has been applied to the sera of patients with interstitial lung diseases. The sandwich ELISA is capable of determining an SP-A level ranging from 2 to 250 ng/mL when native SP-A isolated from patients with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis is used as a standard [15, 48]. Since human SP-A has been found to contain group A antigenic determinants, the criticism may be raised that monoclonal antibodies PC6 and PE10 may recognize simply group A antigen but not SP-A in the blood samples. When human serum is applied to an affinity column on mannose-sepharose and the serum proteins binding to the mannose-affinity matrix are analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-SP-A monoclonal antibody or anti-SP-D monoclonal antibody, the fraction with lectin activity contains approximately 35 kDa protein and 43 kDa protein, which correspond to the molecular sizes of SP-A and SP-D, respectively, purified from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) [49]. This demonstrates that SP-A and SP-D exist in the bloodstream. One study has experimentally demonstrated that SP-A leaks from alveolar spaces into vessels. Human recombinant SP-A and/or artificial surfactant was intratracheally injected into immature newborn rabbits, and human SP-A in alveolar washings and sera was monitored by ELISA with PC6 and PE10, which do not cross-react with rabbit SP-A. The group that intratracheally received human SP-A and saline showed that 2.4 % of the human SP-A which was instilled into the lungs was detected in sera by ELISA. Since the group receiving saline alone showed no detectable human SP-A in sera, this study clearly demonstrates that SP-A leaks from alveolar space into the bloodstream [50]. Although the exact mechanism for the increase of SP-A and SP-D in sera of patients with interstitial pneumonia remains unknown, it is probably a combination of a loss of epithelial integrity due to injury and an increased mass of alveolar type II cells due to hyperplasia (Fig. 5.3).\n",

A correlation between KL-6 levels measured in BALF and in serum was shown in patients with interstitial pneumonia. In patients with chronic beryllium disease, KL-6 serum levels correlated with albumin levels in BALF [52]. These results demonstrated that KL-6, which was produced in the lungs, appeared in the bloodstream as well as lung collectins and that serum KL-6 levels reflected the permeability of the air-blood barrier (Fig. 5.3). Since KL-6 is an extremely high molecular weight glycoprotein, both the destruction of the alveolar-capillary barrier and the enhancement of alveolar-capillary permeability are thought to be necessary for the leakage of KL-6 into the bloodstream.",

When the cutoff values (mean \u00b1 2SD of healthy control subjects) were set at 43.8 ng/mL for serum SP-A and 109.8 ng/mL for serum SP-D, IPF patients showed high sensitivities for SP-A (78 %) and SP-D (87 %).

It is important to promptly know about the occurrence of acute exacerbation and to start optimal therapy. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is a reliable examination method for detecting acute exacerbations; however, it is not always possible to be repeated at frequent intervals. The serum levels of these biomarkers increase without exception when patients with IPF develop respiratory failure due to acute exacerbation [13, 65]. In contrast, IPF patients developing respiratory failure due to bacterial infection seldom show high levels of these biomarkers. Therefore, the measurements of these biomarkers may support the differential diagnosis for causes of acute respiratory failure. Moreover, in many patients, the levels concomitantly decline promptly with clinical improvement, suggesting that these biomarkers may be reliable monitoring markers.",

Our study demonstrated that high levels of serum SP-A and SP-D were associated with mortality in patients with IPF. Fifty-two IPF patients were studied to evaluate the association between serum SP-A and SP-D and deterioration in pulmonary function and survival during 3 years of follow-up. The SP-D concentration, unlike that of SP-A, was related to the rate of deterioration per year in pulmonary function. The concentrations of SP-A and SP-D in patients who died within 3 years were significantly higher than in patients who were still alive after 3 years. Initial SP-A levels in non-survivors (117.7 \u00b1 66.8 ng/mL) were significantly higher than those in survivors (68.8 \u00b1 40.4 ng/L) (p = 0.0125). Initial SP-D levels in non-survivors (453.7 \u00b1 290.3 ng/mL) were also significantly higher than those in survivors (248.0 \u00b1 176.4 ng/mL) (p = 0.0032) [13]. In a study using Cox\u2019s proportional hazards model, Greene et al. found that the levels of serum SP-A (log of SP-A, HR, 1.73; p = 0.031) and SP-D (log of SP-D, HR, 2.04; p = 0.003) in patients with IPF (n = 142) were significant predictors of mortality after adjusting for smoking history and age [14]. These studies were performed before ATS/ERS consensus classification for the diagnosis of IPF and might have included patients with nonspecific interstitial pneumonia [2]. Kinder et al. found that serum SP-A levels (each increase of 48.7 ng/mL, HR, 3.27; p = 0.003) were associated with an increased risk of 1-year mortality after controlling for known clinical predictors. There was no significant association between SP-D level and mortality, although addition of SP-D to SP-A improved 1-year mortality prediction significantly (area under the curve, 0.89 vs 0.76; p = 0.03) [66].",

In areas of more severe involvement, there is often reticular opacity, traction bronchiectasis (TBE), and subpleural honeycombing (HCMB).

Next, we divided the IPF subjects into two subgroups: GGO-dominant type and parenchymal collapse opacity (PCO), which was defined as air bronchiolograms with intense lung attenuation with parenchymal collapse, often accompanied by thickened vessels and traction bronchiectasis. PCO may reflect collapsed and fibrotic abnormalities in peripheral airspaces of alveoli and bronchioles. SP-A levels (51.3 \u00b1 33.3 ng/mL) in PCO-dominant type were significantly (p = 0.0003) lower than those (98.3 \u00b1 55.8 ng/mL) in the GGO-dominant type, whereas SP-D levels were not significantly different for two types (GGO-dominant type, 243.1 \u00b1 142.4 ng/mL; PCO-dominant type, 266.6 \u00b1 161.1 ng/mL).

For instance, an increase in the serum levels of SP-A and SP-D even in early and mild lung injury is often observed, while serum KL-6 levels remain unchanged [68]. The increases in serum KL-6 mean a leakage of high molecular weight protein from the alveolar space into the bloodstream, and that indicates an intense destruction of the alveolar-capillary barrier. It is believed that the discrepancy between serum KL-6 and lung collectins reflects the difference in the extent of alveolar epithelium damage. As another mechanism for dissociation, the dissociation between KL-6 and collectins in patients with acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP) may be a good case. Serum SP-A and SP-D are present at quite high levels; however, serum KL-6 remains at low level in AEP patients [69]. Lung collectins are secretory proteins, while KL-6 is basically a structural component of the cell membrane and its extracellular domain binds to the cell surface. Therefore, the presence of some proteinase, such as ADAM17 or ADAM9, to cleave its extracellular domain, may be essential for liberation into the alveolar space. If enzyme activity is lacking, KL-6 will be limited on the cell surface even though severe interstitial damage exists. BALFs from IPF patients show high concentrations of KL-6; however, KL-6 in the BALFs from AEP patients are within normal range, suggesting the mechanism responsible for the difference may be associated with the secretion manner of these proteins.",

A recent study from this laboratory demonstrated that the difference in hydrophilicity of the two proteins could be the cause of their difference in migration from the air space into the bloodstream [70]. Most of the SP-A found in the alveolar space is bound to DPPC, which is the main component of pulmonary surfactant. In contrast, SP-D remains in a lipid-free state in the alveolar space. SP-A decreases hydrophilicity by binding to DPPC, thus making it more difficult for SP-A to migrate to the bloodstream.
