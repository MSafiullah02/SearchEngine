The escape of an aerosol of anthrax pathogen at the military facility caused the outbreak (Meselson et al., 1994).

The transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome that swiped Southeast Asia was partly because of aerial spread (Eubank et al., 2004; Weiss and McMichael, 2004). The more typical aerial transmission is the measles, which had caused the infection in students who had not been vaccinated (Riley et al., 1978). Recent studies have shown that airborne bacteria and fungi can disperse locally or over long distance (Brown and Hovmoller, 2002; Lee et al., 2007; Mims and Mims, 2004; Stewart et al., 1995). It is very clear that microbial aerosol is a great threat to human and animal health.",

Alternatively, whether microbes come from animal house may be determined by their sensitivity to antibiotics (Chai et al., 2003; Yao et al., 2007). However, the efficacy of these methods is limited, usually unable to confirm the ultimate source. Only do the genes are identified in bacteria from animal feces, indoor and outdoor aerosol, shall evidence be sufficient. Therefore, we performed PCR\u2010amplified repetitive extragenic palindromic (REP\u2010PCR) analysis on Staphylococcus aureus, comparing the genetic relationship of different isolates in the current study, in addition to the determination of the concentration of S. aureus inside and different distance outside of four poultry houses. These studies are necessary to resolve the source of microbial aerosols and their spreading path, providing scientific bases for animal disease control and warning.",

            "text": "REP\u2010PCR was established by Versalovic et al. (1994). An REP element is a conserved genomic DNA sequence with a consensus sequence of 38 bp containing a 5\u2010bp variable loop between the palindrome stem and six degenerated positions at both ends. The palindromic sequence and the ability to form a frame are the key for it to have high level of conservation. Using one or more pairs of primer, the REP element can be amplified. Upon clustering analysis of the REP\u2010PCR product using computer program, similarity indices can be obtained. In turn, REP\u2010PCR profile can represent the relatedness of bacterial strains. Theoretically, isolates of the same species, same type and identical genetic composition should have specific DNA fingerprints (Ichiyama et al., 1991). Thus, REP\u2010PCR can be applied to the identification of bacterial species, types or isolates. It has been shown that this method is reproducible and accurate. Vecchio et al. (1995) showed that their PCR products were highly reproducible and stable when trying to distinguish 170 stains of Mycoplasma pneumoniae using RW3A of RepMP3 as primer. Van der Zee et al. (1999) showed that REP\u2010PCR results were similar to pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis. PFGE of large restriction fragment can distinguish many bacteria and yeast pathogens. The identification ability by PFGE can be as high as 87\u2013100%. Echeverrigaray et al. (1999) analyzed 16 strains of commercial yeast strain and classified these strains into three groups. It is evident that REP\u2010PCR is accurate and reliable. Many researchers have used it for bacterial pathogen studies and molecular epidemiology investigation (Francois et al., 2005; Ibenyassine et al., 2006; Jurkovi\u010d et al., 2007).",

In the present experiment, no S. aureus was isolated from downwind 400 m from farms C and D, which might have resulted from the death of microbes under the effect of UV light, temperature and relative humidity (Che, 1986). It is also possible that long\u2010time sampling might have stressed the microbes resulting in death (Marthi et al., 1990; Stewart et al., 1995).",

Similarly, isolates downwind were identical to 57.1% (10/18, 55.6%; 4/8, 50%; 3/5, 60%; and 3/4, 75%, respectively for the four farms) those from indoor and feces.

In their study on the transmission dynamics of antibiotics\u2010resistant bacteria, Austin and Anderson (1999) pointed out that such transmission may prove difficult to eradicate, ultimately requiring careful surveillance and effective infection control measures. Thus, the use of S. aureus as an indicator to study the origin and spread of airborne pathogens from chicken houses is potentially useful for enhancing public health and understanding the airborne epidemiology of this pathogen.",
