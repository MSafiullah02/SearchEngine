            "text": "The Niger Delta region of Nigeria is widely recognized as a complex and contentious space for oil exploration and production. Over the past few decades, the Niger Delta has witnessed large-scale mass peaceful mobilizations and rebellion-like conditions from violent militia groups. Oil companies have been implicated in violence perpetrated by Nigerian security forces. Local host communities have suffered greatly from corruption, political instability, violence and the environmental devastation of their farmlands and fishing grounds. Oil companies have increasingly turned to corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives to attempt to build or repair relations with oil-producing communities. There are also governmental and nongovernmental humanitarian actors supporting various initiatives in the oil-producing areas. This article highlights the challenges that one long running micro-scale development project has faced due to the COVID 19 disease outbreak and the closure of all schools in Rivers State, Nigeria in March 2020. The school closures have halted some initiatives, but our weekly nutritional program feedings have continued in new, socially distanced forms.",

Influential United Nations publications have highlighted the low levels of human development in the region despite it being the overwhelming source of Nigeria's vast oil wealth (UNDP, 2006) and the profound and systematic devastation of its environment and fragile wetlands ecosystem by decades of oil production (UNEP, 2011) .",

Although much of the Niger Delta is often presented in terms of \"villages\" or \"the rural areas\"; in reality, these villages often have rudimentary houses tightly packed together in surprisingly densely populated small areas. A typical village house will host four-seven people in it and be located just a few feet away from other such houses. The lack of accessible piped drinking water and adequate sanitation make frequent hand washing difficult. Most Niger Delta villagers will never have free access into an oil company facility, but they know that oil workers have dramatically better health care facilities than they do. This will surely increase resentment as their increased exposure to the disease risk is exacerbated by their comparative material poverty and the adverse economic effects of the lock-down.",

The fat content of soybeans is a rich source of omega-3 fatty acid (fish oil) which plays a significant medical role in the treatment of heart diseases. The Ogi Soy Plus is typically prepared either in what Nigerians call a \"pap\" formula (porridge or oatmeal-like consistency) or in a dry formula which can be mixed into rice.

We did not want to abandon the nutrition program as the children are only likely to get even more malnourished as COVID 19 restrictions further minimize their parents' ability to feed them. We discussed this with the parents who all agreed that they wanted the program to continue. As such, on March 27, 2020 we had our first socially distanced feeding with the children spread out across four or five different classrooms to enable us to maintain the requisite amount of distance between them (see photo 2). This level of social distancing would not previously have been possible when the other kids were in attendance and those classrooms were in use.
