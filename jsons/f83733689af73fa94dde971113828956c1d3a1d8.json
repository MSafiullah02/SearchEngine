The link between environment and immunity is particularly intriguing as it is known that chemicals and drugs can cause immunotoxicity (e.g., allergies and autoimmune diseases). In this review, we emphasize the relationship between long-term exposure to xenobiotic mixtures and immune deficiency inherent to chronic diseases and epidemics/pandemics. We also address the immunotoxicologic risk of vulnerable groups, taking into account biochemical and biophysical properties of SARS-CoV-2 and its immunopathological implications. We particularly underline the common mechanisms by which xenobiotics and SARS-CoV-2 act at the cellular and molecular level. We discuss how long-term exposure to thousand chemicals in mixtures, mostly fossil fuel derivatives, exposure toparticle matters, metals, ultraviolet (UV)-B radiation, ionizing radiation and lifestyle contribute to immunodeficiency observed in the contemporary pandemic, such as COVID-19, and thus threaten global public health, human prosperity and achievements, and global economy. Finally, we propose metrics which are needed to address the diverse health effects of anthropogenic COVID-19 crisis at present and those required to prevent similar future pandemics.",

The transmission model, clinical manifestations, pathogenesis and treatment of coronavirus disease have been recently reviewed (Docea et al., 2020) . Figure 1 shows an anthropological and scientific approach for the evaluation of the association of the global production of crude oil, atmospheric pollutants, and pesticides with the population growth and chronic diseases trends (Guillette et al., how xenobiotics (such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH)) acting via immunomodulatory signaling pathways, and specifically the aryl hydrocarbon receptors (AhR), may adversely affect the developing immune system (which seems to be more sensitive to environmental insults than the adult immune system (Kreitinger et al., 2016) ). Immunotoxicology can also be beneficial in investigating whether an epidemic/pandemic, or a chronic disease, is idiopathic or a deterministic event reflecting cumulative adverse effects on the immune system.

While AhR canonical signaling has been identified as a primary mediator of biological responsiveness to environmental chemicals, alternative signaling events are increasingly being understood to mediate the physiological effects of AhR (Khazaal et al., 2018) . AhR is a cytosolic signal sensor and transcription factor that translocates into the nucleus upon binding to planar aromatic hydrocarbons. In addition, AhR signaling is intricately involved in fine-tuning distinct immune responses, particularly at environmental interfaces where endogenous and exogenous AhR ligands accumulate (Quintana et al., 2008) . For example, AhR activity has been documented to be a key determinant of T helper (Th) cell differentiation. Notably, ligands with differential AhR agonist activity may have opposing effects on Th cell differentiation, demonstrating the finely tuned regulation of this transcription factor at the ligandbinding level (Quintana et al., 2008) .",

This part of the respiratory system, however, is vulnerable to the effects of very fine particulate matter (especially matter with a diameter less than 2.5 \u03bcm, which is mainly produced by diesel engines, charcoalburning, wood-burning, and industrial exhausts).

The use of lead as a petrol additive, or more generally as an environmental contaminant, has adverse effects on the immune system, since the immune system appears to be quite sensitive to lead. Lead-induced skewing of immune responses has the potential to alter the incidence of asthma, autoimmunity, infectious diseases, or cancer (Dietert et al., 2004) .",

Thus, the relevant exposure framework for evaluating potential impairment of the immune function relies on assessing mixtures of chemicals (and other toxic stressors) rather than single chemicals in our changing environment. According to this approach, exposure to chemical mixtures during development could be more detrimental to the immune system than exposure to single chemicals, depending on the nature of the chemicals and their dosages. While the developmental stage is the most vulnerable period to chemical toxicity, exposure during non-critical periods should also be considered.

This gene encodes four structural proteins, namely spike glycoprotein (S), a small envelope protein (E), matrix glycoprotein (M) and nucleocapsid protein (N) . The entry of the virus into cells is mediated by the S protein, in particular by attaching its surface unit (S2) to ACE2, an enzyme present in primarily type II pneumocytes (lung alveolar epithelial cells). Then the S protein is cleaved by cellular proteases and the viral capside is fused with the cellular membrane, thus allowing intracellular translocation of SARS-CoV-2 coupled with ACE2 by endocytosis (Cava et al., 2020) . This is followed by massive intracellular replication of SARS-CoV-2, which then undergoes exocytosis where it binds again to ACE2, thus entering into a vicious cycle (Abassi et al., 2020) Furthermore, after endocytosis of the SARS-CoV-2/ACE2 complex, surface ACE2 is down-regulated, resulting in unopposed angiotensin II accumulation (Vaduganathan et al., 2020) . The binding affinity of specific receptor binding of S protein is related to virus infectivity and pathogenicity . In this regard, ACE2 genetic polymorphisms and expression levels in different tissues might alter host susceptibility to COVID-19 by affecting the interaction with SARS-CoV-2 S-protein.",

Hence, the binding of SARS-CoV-2 with ACE2 neutralizes the advantageous physiological effects of this enzyme. Attenuation of ACE2 catalytic function alters RAAS system activity, resulting in enhanced inflammation and vascular permeability observed in the pathogenesis of inflammatory lung disease, eventually leading to acute lung injury and adult respiratory distress syndrome as observed in patients with severe COVID-19 (Chen et al., 2020) . Hence, local activation of the RAAS may mediate lung injury responses to viral insults (Vaduganathan et al., 2020) . Indeed, when angiotensin I and angiotensin II receptors (AT1R and AT2R, respectively) are activated, they lead to the increased expression of proinflammatory mediators (e.g., IL-6), triggering an inflammatory process in the lungs and other organs. In particular, AT1R activates the transcription factors NF-kB and activator protein 1 (AP-1), which in turn increases cytokine expression, apoptosis, vasoconstriction, fibroproliferation, retention of Na+, and the enhancement of lung injury. The endogenous angiotensin II inhibits alveolar fluid clearance and dysregulates epithelial Na + channel (ENaC) expression via AT1R, contributing to alveolar filling and pulmonary edema (Cava et al., 2020) .",

Signaling results in nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NF-\u03baB, which regulates the expression of distinct genes in immunity or development (Anthoney et al., 2018) . TLR has been implicated in the pathogenesis of airway disease resulting from respiratory virus infections, with TLR signaling leading to the activation of type I interferons (IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2), proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF, IFN-\u03b3, and CCL5), and interferon-stimulated genes (Totura et al., 2015) . The binding of SARS-CoV-2 to the TLR activates the its downstream signaling pathway, causing the release of pro-IL-1\u03b2 (which is cleaved by caspase-1). This is followed by inflammasome activation and production of active mature IL-1\u03b2, which is a mediator of lung inflammation, fever and fibrosis (Conti et al., 2020) . Moreover, many nodal points used by viruses and chemicals to generate, develop and disperse pathologies and diseases have been used over the last three decades individually or in combination as targets for modern checkpoint therapies through monoclonal antibodies in order to address these diseases (Peng et al., 2016; Hafeez et al., 2018) . Transcription factors, membrane receptor signaling pathways, and protein kinase signaling pathways, are all key players of xenobiotic-induced cancer in adults (Eldakroory et al., 2017) and children (Hargrave et al., 2006) , hematological and lymphoid malignancies (Leon et al., 2019) , Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease (Aloizou et al., 2020) and stroke (Tsatsakis et al., 2019b) . Furthermore, this knowledge has also been valuable for molecular-oriented anti-cancer therapy (Liu et al., 2018) . ACE2 expression has been shown to be upregulated by infection with SARS-CoV-2 . However, the relation between ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 virulence is complex and it is attracting extreme interest currently (Hoffmann et al., 2020) , following concern about the potential ability of some anti-hypertensive drugs, such as ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) to increase Covid-19 severity and case fatality rate (Day, 2020; Zheng et al., 2020) .

Chloroquine may also thwart viral protein maturation, block the recognition of viral antigens by dendritic cells, and increase cytotoxic CD8 + T-cell activity to viral antigens. In addition, it blocks phosphorylation (activation) of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and caspase-1 (Steiz et al., 2003) in THP-1 cells, both of which are required for SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses replication (Briant et al., 1998) . Moreover, chloroquine affects immune system activity by mediating an anti-inflammatory response, which might reduce damage due to the cytokine storm. Chloroquine inhibits IL-1\u03b2 mRNA expression in THP-1 cells, reduces IL-1\u03b2 release, IL-1 and IL-6 cytokines in monocytes/macrophages, and IFN\u03b1, IFN\u03b2, IFN\u03b3, TNF\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-12 gene expression (Devaux et al., 2020) . Lysosomotropic agents, ammonia chloride and bafilomycin A, have been found to reduce the transduction on 293/hACE2 cells by SARS-CoV-2 S, and thus inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells through endocytosis (Villamil Giraldo et al., 2014; Ou et al., 2020) .",

            "text": "Nutritional modulation of the immune system is also associated with reduction or delayed onset of immune-mediated chronic diseases. Several micronutrients and dietary components have been shown to play specific roles in the development and maintenance of an effective immune system. For example, arginine is necessary for the nitric oxide generation by macrophages, and vitamin A and zinc are known regulators of cell division. Vitamin E is both an antioxidant (Lee and Han, 2018) and protein kinase C activity inhibitor (Childs et al, 2019) . Dietary and supplementation interventions enriching the gut microbiome, such as the use of probiotics and prebiotics (Hill et al., 2014) , may be needed to help enhancing or restoring a healthy gut microbiome. In addition, diets lacking vegetables may decrease the diversity of nutrients reaching the gut microbiome. This in turn alters epithelial integrity resulting in increased permeability or 'leaky gut', allowing immune cells within the gutassociated lymphoid tissue to be directly exposed to intraluminal nutrients or elements of the gut microbiota. A great example of altered gut permeability induced by micronutrient status is that of vitamin D. Specifically, vitamin D-deficient diets are found to be responsible for increased epithelial permeability due to dysfunctioning tight junctions, resulting in both acute and chronic gut inflammation (Bischoff et al., 2014; Sassi et al., 2018) . Optimal probiotic bacterial composition has been shown to effectively reduce inflammation, characterized by reduction of proinflammatory Th1 and Th17 cytokines, such as IL-17 and IFN-\u03b3, and concomitant increases in the levels of inflammation-resolving cytokine, such as IL-10 (Santiago-Lopez et al., 2018) . On the other hand, prebiotics can be used not only as substrates for bacterial metabolism but also to enhance barrier function. The unparalleled importance of natural and wellbalanced diets has been also highlighted vis-\u00e0-vis infant formula consumptions. It is well established that breastfeeding affords passive immunity to the infant via transfer of antibodies, growth factors, and cytokines to the offspring (Torres-Castro et al., 2018; Plaza-Diaz et al., 2018) . Breastmilk is also enriched with microbiota thatpromote the maturation of gut-associated lymphoid tissue (Donovan et al., 2016) , playing a key role in development of the immune system during thymus maturation, particularly for T cell function. In breastfed infants, complementary feeding with prebiotics for optimal microbiome maintenance has been proposed (McKeen et al., 2019) .",

One example is the \"Starlink\" maize, which was engineered with genetic information from Bacillus thuringiensis to increase the plant's resistance to various insects (Nawaz et al., 2019; Tsatsakis et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2016) . Except for xenobiotic and GMOs allergenicity, there are genetic hazards arising from the inserted gene, its expressed protein per se, and secondary or pleiotropic effects on other gene expression. This results in disruption of natural genes in the manipulated organism (Bawa and Anilakumar, 2013) .",

Since the S2 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 is highly conserved, it could be a target for antiviral (anti-S2) drugs; however, the potential for viral mutations may be responsible for future disease relapses (Cascella et al., 2020) . In this study, we emphasize that in addition to the urgent measures that are necessary to interrupt the coronavirus transmission from farming animals to humans, there is also a need to improve the current global strategy for energy management and other factors that may adversely affect the immune system of the human, and thereby increase the risk of both infectious and chronic-degenerative diseases. Exposures to large classes of xenobiotics have a triple impact on the immune system. First, xenobiotics promote immunomodulatory effects in immune cells. Second, xenobiotics increase the range of immunotoxicity of human-associated micro-organisms or new viral and microbial attacks. Third, xenobiotics may reduce vaccine efficacy.",

Given the guidance of the health authorities to transfer COVID-19 patients into hospitals only when presenting fever and dyspnea, it appears that for all admitted patients, and especially for ICU patients, the inflammosome is already at an advanced stage precluding effective treatment.

            "text": "have common and more than one mechanisms of action.Chronic organochlorine, organophosphate, paraquat and pyrethroid exposures have been linked to Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases through mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and apoptosis via cell signaling pathways(Cao et al., 2019). Some pesticides have been reported as potential risk factors of chronic erectile dysfunctions(Polsky et al., 2007), probably via NADPH oxidase/ ROS production and reduced bioavailability ofNO (Jin et al., 2008). Experimentally, DDE (a metabolite of DTT) exposure exhibits a diabetogenic potential, with an underlying immunomodulatory mechanism likely via cytokine cascades, or disrupted glucose homeostasis(Cetkovic-Cvrlje et al., 2016).Cardiovascular toxicity has also been reported following exposure of zebrafish to deltamethrin(Meng et al., 2019).Adjuvants in pesticides formulations are used to increase the pesticidal effect of the active ingredient. However, this is a constant underestimated factor of pesticide mixture chronic toxicity(Mesnage et al., 2013). For instance, it has been shown that animals subjected to concomitant exposure to certain fungicides, such as ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors, are able to increase the pyrethroid and neonicotinoid insecticides cytotoxicity up to 1000-and 8-fold respectively. This combined exposure may result in enforced lipogenesis and/or oncogenic transcriptional alterations, which may not occur with individual chemicals(Thompson et al., 2014).Xenobiotics and viruses activate similar transmembrane receptors of cytokines, tolllike receptors, growth factors, secondary signaling pathways, such as TLR/MYD/NF-kB, P38 MAPK/AP-1, AhR, hormone receptors, B-cell receptor or Cyclin D signaling pathways, directly and indirectly and thus alter the global gene expression transcriptionally and epigenetically(Conti et al., 2020; Gangemi et al., 2016).Xenobiotics and viruses affect the metabolism of Ca +2 , K + and Clefflux, vitamin D, iron and coagulation factors, disrupt redox biology, activate proteasome and the inflammasome system, alter microbiome and virome, increase PGE 2 via COX2, and increase Th 1 cytokines, resulting in T-cell immaturity(Go and Jones, 2014; Joly   Condette et al., 2015).Xenobiotics and viruses disrupt the redox biology, reduce antioxidant enzyme activities, increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress, ATP and energy depletion, DNA instability through DNA damage or epigenetic alterations, premature cell death and ageing(Go and Jones, 2014; Joly Condette et al., 2015;Mart\u00ednez-Valenzuela et al., 2017). Furthermore, both xenobiotics and living microorganisms may contribute to increased resistance to treatments, bacteria or viruses aggressiveness, communicable diseases and decreased vaccination effectiveness.Viral infections and chemical exposures can produce pro-inflammatory mediators that, if sustained over time, result in chronic inflammation in target organs. This condition often entails tissue damage, increased mutation rate and genomic instability, which represents a cancer-prone microenvironment(Kidane et al., 2014). In cardiovascular morbidity, xenobiotics and viruses have been found to increase chemokines, cytokines, heart mitochondrial GPx activity, DNA damage, cholesterolemia, expression of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and pro-coagulant activity, ROS, TNF-\u03b1 and TGF-\u03b2, protein and lipid oxidation in heart cells, endothelial dysfunction, and decreased mitochondrial GSH levels, resulting in hyper-coagulability and thrombosis(Zafiropoulos et al., 2014).Both xenobiotic and viral immune morbidity are due to alterations in gene mRNA and protein expression via pro-inflammatory cytokine, chemokine, kinase and neuroendocrine signaling, activation of T-cells, disruption of gut microbiota and immune homeostasis(Go et al., 2015; Jin et al., 2017). These reprogram the cell cycle control in the Golgi region via cycline gene alterations and premature cell death(Chiappini et al., 2014). Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune thyroidopathies, systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, fibromyalgia-osteoarthritis, chronic pain, and multiple chemical hypersensitivity have been associated with pesticide exposure(Fern\u00e1ndez-Sol\u00e0 et al., 2005; Langer, 2010; Williams et al., 2018).Global immune deficiency, vaccine and drug ineffectiveness, bacterial and virus virulence, cancer aggressiveness, increased chronic inflammatory pathologies are associated with various pesticide adverse immune effects.Additionally, pesticide exposure in neonates and children is correlated with alterations in B-cell maturation, rapid cell proliferation, disruptive homeostasis of the prooxidant agents, altered fecal microbiota composition, cytokine expression and antioxidant defenses, steroids and genomic alterationsLing et al., 2014; Mona et al., 2012). Both NMs and viruses can affect the adaptive immune response by direct activation of antigen-presenting cells (APCs), including B cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, helper and cytotoxic T cells, and can contribute to both intracellular and extracellular immune response deficiency to pathogens but also to increase tissue-specific autoimmunity, observed in autoimmune diseases(Kalkanidis   et al., 2006). Both hydrophobic nanoparticles < 5 nm and viruses dictate the immune response exhibiting the greatest expression of inflammatory cytokines(Moyano et al., 2012).",
