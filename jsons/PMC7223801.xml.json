Mesh implantation has become heavily practiced, as these implants were shown to strengthen the rupture site and produce less than half the recurrence rate of the sutured closures [4]. Most of the meshes used nowadays are knitted from monofilament polypropylene. Polypropylene is affordable, chemically inert, and able to withstand sterilization while retaining flexibility [5]. Porosity of the mesh suggests the enhanced tissue integration and the reduced foreign body reaction. However, many biocompatibility issues such as mechanical failure, seroma formation, and infection remain to be a concern for hernia repair [6].",

While the exact cause of the chronic pain has not been established yet, lack of material inertness in vivo and oxidative environment induced by inflammatory cells in the incision area appear to be the key factors in poor mesh performance [2, 5, 8]. White blood cells are recruited at the interface between tissue and mesh fibers within minutes to hours after the implantation. Recognition of a non-host surface by these cells induces an exocytotic release of lytic enzymes and oxidants to degrade the foreign body. These oxidants are mainly reactive oxygen species (ROS), with superoxide anion, peroxynitrite, and hydroxyl radical being among the most notable ones. These compounds have been shown to both deteriorate the surface of the mesh and penetrate the fibers, therefore altering both bulk and surface properties [5, 9]. Hypochlorite ions produced by myeloperoxidase found in neutrophils and macrophages have also been reported to assist in oxidative degradation of the implant [10].",

These include alterations in a pore size and shape, transition from a heavyweight to a lightweight mesh, knitting design of the fibers, etc. Levinson et al. showed that modifying the knits in the mesh significantly improves device mechanical performance and enhances tension-free repair [11]. Lightweight mesh has been reported to induce fewer peritoneal adhesions than a heavyweight mesh does [12]. Other studies showed that the meshes with larger pores and complex pore shape promote better tissue ingrowth than their counterparts with smaller circular/oval pores [13]. For example, Deeken et al. demonstrated that the meshes with hexagonal pores perform significantly better in terms of host tissue response than the meshes with diamond-shape or circular pores [13]. Nevertheless, these strategies only yield incremental improvements in the overall long-term post-operative complications.",

Modifying the surface may be advantageous in two generic ways: protection of the implant from degradation and mitigation of the foreign body reaction. Thus, hernia mesh had been subjected to various coatings in many studies [14\u201316]. Emans et al. proposed that coating hernia mesh with oxygenated cellulose hydrogel reduces tissue adhesions [14]. Other researchers focused on preventing clinical infections associated with hernioplasty. For example, coating meshes with antimicrobial enzyme proteases, such as lysostaphin, has been proven to significantly reduce the infection rate and bacterial colonization of the mesh [17]. In an attempt to mitigate inflammatory response after implantation, nitric oxide was adsorbed to the surface of mesh with polyvinyl alcohol used as a scaffolding carrier [15]. The study revealed reduced inflammatory response to these meshes when compared to uncoated meshes but, unfortunately, exogenous NO has proved to be cytotoxic [15]. Therefore, the search for an optimal anti-inflammatory coating of hernia repair meshes is still in progress.",

It showed great efficacy in vivo for the conditions where oxidative stress plays a crucial role. For example, infusion of vitamin E is used in ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene hip and knee implants to make them resistant to oxidation [18]. Regarding hernia repair, intraperitoneal injections of vitamin E following mesh implantation have been found to reduce tissue adhesions in a rat model [19].

At the semilunar line, the dissection transitioned to the plane between the transversus abdominis and internal oblique muscles laterally. An intermuscular plane was formed to accommodate a 3 cm \u00d7 3 cm mesh. The posterior sheath was then re-approximated in the midline with 4\u20130 polydioxanone suture in a running fashion. One vitamin E-coated and one uncoated mesh were implanted into each rabbit on left and right sides, symmetrically with respect to the linea alba. As it was observed in the pilot study, coated meshes were not sticky and their handling was not different from the uncoated meshes. The mesh pieces were secured to the muscle inferiorly at the four corners with 4\u20130 polydioxanone suture.

Vitamin E is a well-known antioxidant that is already used in modification of various implants, such as UHMWPE acetabular liners [18]. Furthermore, vitamin E is hydrophobic, which results in a slow release into an aqueous fluid. We have previously shown that 70% of bound vitamin E remains on the mesh surface after 10 days of incubation in 10% bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution, suggesting that the sustained release can be achieved in vivo for during entire wound healing period [20]. All of these considerations make vitamin E a promising bioactive coating that can be applied onto the mesh to reduce inflammatory and oxidative damage to the tissues and the implant.",

Macrophages were observed in the proximity of both vitamin E-coated and uncoated meshes (Fig. 1). These findings are consistent with numerous previous studies in literature [2, 14, 24, 25]. However, the macrophage count near vitamin E-coated meshes was significantly lower compared to uncoated meshes (Table 2).

It is important to point out that adequate neovascularization is required for the remodeling phase of wound healing, and, therefore, is desirable. However, vast angiogenesis has been associated with poor biocompatibility and intense foreign body reaction [21]. The fact that the uncoated meshes had more newly-formed vessels around them may suggest that either this tissue goes through more extensive remodeling or their wound healing process is delayed compared to the tissue near the vitamin E-coated meshes.",

In the case of uncoated meshes, all samples had areas with multiple large cracks oriented perpendicularly to the fiber direction (Fig. 4c). Surface peeling was also detected for some uncoated meshes, particularly at weave junctions (Fig. 4a). The origin of such mesh deterioration has been discussed in a number of in vivo reports [24, 25, 27]. Prevalent opinion is that mesh deterioration occurs in vivo due to the mechanical stress and oxidative degradation [24, 25, 27]. Alternatively, some authors believe that mesh deterioration occurs after the explantation, during the storage of tissue-coated mesh explants in formaldehyde solution [28]. According to these authors, the observed cracked layer is in fact crosslinked formaldehyde-protein polymer that cannot be removed by conventional hypochlorite cleaning treatment. The first point of view is supported by the fact that all forms of polypropylene are prone to oxidative attack at the tertiary carbon\u2013hydrogen bond [29]. According to Ratner et al., mechanical stresses and environmental conditions act synergistically to cause degradation in polymers, termed by \u201cenvironmental stress cracking\u201d [30]. As mesh in the abdomen is permanently subjected to the stresses induced by breathing and body movements, it is in a higher energy-state than when it is relaxed, and, therefore, is more reactive and susceptible to free radical attack and degradation. Interestingly, Cozad et al. showed that the cracks were concentrated at the weave junctions of the mesh [2]. As these locations have high stress concentrations within the material, they tend to be more reactive than the areas where fibers are relaxed. This elucidates why modifying knit design can improve mesh mechanical performance, such as in the study mentioned in the introduction [11].",
