            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a fatal infectious disease in wild and domestic cats, characterized by fibrinous and granulomatous serositis, protein\u2010rich serous effusion in body cavities, and/or granulomatous inflammatory lesions (Wolfe & Griesemer, 1966). The causative agent of FIP has been revealed to be feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) which arises from feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). Feline coronavirus (FCoV), together with canine coronavirus (CCoV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus of pigs, belongs to the species Alphacoronavirus 1, the genus Alphacoronavirus, the subfamily Coronavirinae, the family Coronaviridae, and the order Nidovirales. FCoVs are single\u2010stranded positive sense RNA viruses with an approximately 29 kb nonsegmented genome, which consisting of 11 open reading frames (ORFs) (Myrrha et al., 2011). FCoVs are classified into two serotypes, type I and type II FCoVs, according to their serological properties; they are also separated into two biotypes, FECV and FIPV, based on pathogenicity. These two biotypes, FECV and FIPV, exist in both serotypes I and II (Tekes & Thiel, 2016). Both type I and type II FCoVs can cause FIP. FIP remains one of the most frequently fatal infectious feline diseases for which there are no effective therapies.",

However, type II FCoV infection has predominantly been observed in various Asian countries, reaching 25% (Amer et al., 2012; An et al., 2011; Sharif et al., 2010). Double homologous recombination between type I FCoV and CCoV leads to the emergence of type II FCoV (Decaro & Buonavoglia, 2008; Haijema, Rottier, & de Groot, 2007; Herrewegh, Smeenk, Horzinek, Rottier, & de Groot, 1998; Lin, Chang, Su, & Chueh, 2013; Lorusso et al., 2008; Terada et al., 2014). These data indicate that the causative agent of FIP exhibits immense complexity in different countries and areas. The occurrence of FCoV is frequently reported in China and attracts extensive concern due to its high mortality rate. At present, little information is available on the molecular epidemiology of FCoV in China. In this study, molecular epidemiological investigation of FCoV was carried out in China from November 2015 to January 2018. Partial S genes and nearly complete genomes were used to analyze the genetic evolution of the FCoV strains identified. The aim of the study was to provide insights into the epidemiology and genetic diversity of the FCoV strains circulating in China. The resulting data will provide valuable information for prevention and control of FCoV infections.",

Briefly, RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis for the 50 samples were carried out according to the protocol described by Wang et al. (2016) using random primers (six nucleotides) and an oligo dT18 primer. The double\u2010stranded DNA was synthesized by second strand cDNA synthesis kit (Beyotime Biotechnology, Shanghai, China). Subsequently, 150 ng of cDNA was used to construct a library according to the manufacturer's instructions (TruSeq Nano DNA HT Library Prep Kit), and loaded on to a HiSeq \u00d7 ten for sequencing. Raw sequence reads were trimmed to remove the reads of the adaptor, duplicate reads and host genomic sequences. The trimmed reads were assembled using SOAPdenovo v2.04 (http://soap.genomics.org.cn/), and the assembled genomes were corrected using GapCloser v1.12 software. Viral genes were predicted using the software GeneMarkS (http://topaz.gatech.edu/GeneMark/genemarks.cgi), and annotation of the predicted viruses was carried out through the nonredundant protein database (NR) using BLASTp. In this study, the nearly complete genomes of four FCoV strains were obtained, according to the porcine coronavirus PEDV described by Marthaler et al. (2013). After genome assembly, the single genomic gap of the four FCoV strains was closed using standard Sanger sequencing technology. A similarity plots analysis of the genomes of the FCoV strains identified in our study was performed by the sliding window method as implemented in the SimPlot, v.3.5.1 package (Lole et al., 1999).",

Moreover, analysis of the genomic comparison revealed that the three strains HLJ/HRB/2016/10, HLJ/HRB/2016/11, and HLJ/HRB/2016/13 showed amino acids similarity of 94.7% (percentage of divergence: 5.3%) when compared with the classical Black strain of the type I FCoV; the amino acids similarity of 95.1% (percentage of divergence: 4.9%) were observed between the three strains and the Cat 1 Karlslunde reference strain of the type I FCoV.",

            "text": "In China, FIP is a serious and emerging problem in domestic cats. Little information regarding the epidemiology of FCoV is available in China. In our study, 115 samples of ascitic fluid from FIP\u2010suspected diseased cats and 54 fecal samples from clinically healthy cats were subjected to detection and phylogenetic analysis of FCoV. A total of 126 (74.6%, 126/169) samples were positive for FCoV. Of the 126 FCoV positive samples, the positive rate of FCoV in the FIP\u2010suspected cats was 75.7% (87/115), which was higher than in Korea (19.3%) and Turkey (37.3%) (An et al., 2011; Tekelioglu et al., 2015). The FCoV positive rate of cats from south China (80.0%) was higher than that of north China (73.1%). Several studies have reported that age, breed, sex, and a multi\u2010cat environment are associated with FCoV infection and development of FIP (Addie et al., 2009; Bell, Malik, & Norris, 2006; Sharif et al., 2009; Worthing et al., 2012). In the present study, FCoV infection was significantly associated with living environment and age, which is in line with previous studies (Addie et al., 2009; Drechsler, Alcaraz, Bossong, Collisson, & Diniz, 2011; Tekelioglu et al., 2015); the positive rate of FCoV in a multi\u2010cat environment was higher than that in single cat households. These data suggest that a multi\u2010cat environment confers a high risk for FCoV infection and development of FIP in China.",

On the contrary, several studies have shown that FCoV infection appeared to be significantly correlated with the male sex (Pesteanu\u2010Somogyi, Radzai, & Pressler, 2006; Worthing et al., 2012). However, Tekelioglu et al. (2015) reported that the seroprevalence of FCoV was not associated with sex. In the current study, FCoV infection was also not associated with the breed of cat, which is in line with a study in Turkey (Tekelioglu et al., 2015). In contrast, several studies have reported that FCoV infection exhibited a significant association with breed: purebred cats appear to be more susceptible to FCoV infection (Foley & Pedersen, 1996; Kiss, Kecskem\u00e9ti, Tanyi, Klingeborn, & Bel\u00e1k, 2000). In Australia, FCoV infection occurred at a significantly higher prevalence in British Shorthairs, Cornish Rex and Burmese cats than in Siamese, Persian, Domestic Shorthairs, and Bengal cats (Bell et al., 2006). In Malaysia, the FCoV infection rate in Persian purebred cats (96.0%) was higher than that in the mixed\u2010breed cats (70.0%) (Sharif et al., 2009). In Japan, the prevalence of antibodies against FCoV in purebred cats (66.7%) was higher than that in random breeds (31.2%) (Taharaguchi et al., 2012). In our study, FCoV infection was significantly associated with young cats (aged <6 months). Other studies have reported that cats of ages ranging from 3 to 11 months exhibit a higher FCoV prevalence than those of other ages (Bell et al., 2006; Pedersen, 2009; Taharaguchi et al., 2012). However, FCoV infection in Australia and Malaysia was reported not to be associated with age (Bell et al., 2006; Sharif et al., 2009). These data suggest that the biological reason underlying the age/sex/breed\u2010associated susceptibility and resistance to FCoV remains unknown and is associated with different lifestyles and FCoV exposure in different studies.",

            "text": "The FCoVs are classified into two distinct serotypes, type I FCoV and type II FCoV, according to their serological properties. In our study, the partial S genes of 95 samples were successfully sequenced, out of the 126 FCoV positive samples. Of the 126 FCoV positive samples, the partial S genes of 31 samples were not obtained due to the low viral load in samples or the potential mismatching between primers and templates. Most of the FCoV strains identified in our study belonged to type I FCoV (95.8%, 91/95) according to the phylogenetic analysis of the partial S gene; only four FCoV strains (4.2%, 4/95) were allocated to type II FCoV. In our study, the prevalence of type I FCoV in the FIP\u2010suspected cats was higher than that of type I FCoV in Taiwan (89.0%, p > 0.05) and Korea (54.5%, p < 0.01) (An et al., 2011; Lin et al., 2009). These data suggested that type I FCoV was more prevalent in cats in China. Further studies should be conducted to understand the effect of the high prevalence of type I FCoV strains on the development of FIP in China. Co\u2010infection with type I and II FCoVs has been reported in cats in many countries (Benetka et al., 2004; Hohdatsu, Okada, Ishizuka, Yamada, & Koyama, 1992; Kummrow et al., 2005; Lin et al., 2009). Double homologous recombination between type I FCoV and CCoV leads to the emergence of type II FCoV (An et al., 2011; Decaro & Buonavoglia, 2008; Haijema et al., 2007; Herrewegh et al., 1998; Lin et al., 2013; Lorusso et al., 2008; Terada et al., 2014). In our study, co\u2010infection of the type I and II FCoVs was not observed in FIP\u2010suspected or healthy cats. Meanwhile, the type II FCoV strains were only identified in FIP\u2010suspected samples, not in healthy cats. These data demonstrated that FCoV exhibited mainly a single serotype infection in cats in China, which may be attributed to a lack of vaccine immunization against FCoV or co\u2010breeding of dogs and cats in China.",

Further analysis indicated that the six\u2010nucleotide deletion (C4035AGCTC4040) in the three type I FCoV strains was not reported in the current GenBank database, according to the nucleotide BLAST search tool. The information from the limited samples suggested that the three FCoV strains with the six unique nucleotide deletions may be one of the characteristics of Chinese regional type I FCoV strains. The partial S gene\u2010based phylogenetic tree revealed the genetic diversity of the type I FCoV strains identified: the type I FCoV strains collected from the same region of China showed genetic diversity from each other. In contrast, the type II FCoV strains identified in our study formed one clade in the partial S gene\u2010based phylogenetic tree, exhibiting a close relationship with type II FCoV strains from Taiwan and Japan. In our study, analysis of the phylogenetic tree and genome similarity indicated that the three FCoV strains with the nearly complete genome (HLJ/HRB/2016/10, HLJ/HRB/2016/11, and HLJ/HRB/2016/13) formed a potentially new type I FCoV cluster, and differed genetically from the classical Black strain of the type I FCoV from USA and the Cat 1 Karlslunde strain of the type I FCoV from Denmark. These data suggested that the high infection rates of the type I FCoV has led to the high seroprevalence of type I FCoV in the cat population in China. The high variability of the type I FCoV strains in our study may be attributed to long\u2010term interactions between the type I FCoV strains and their hosts. Those strains in the potential new type I FCoV cluster and those with the six unique nucleotide deletions (C4035AGCTC4040) also support the above speculation.",

Type I FCoV strains exhibited high prevalence and genetic diversity in both FIP\u2010affected and clinically healthy cats.
