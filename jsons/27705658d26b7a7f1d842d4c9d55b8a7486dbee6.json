The ECHO model of learning uses videoconferencing to expand healthcare workforce capacity, increase access to specialty level care, and reduce health disparities in underserved communities. ECHO was developed in 2003 at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center (UNMHSC) in Albuquerque, NM, USA, to address unmet needs in the care of patients with chronic hepatitis C in rural parts of the state. Healthcare professionals who regularly participated in interactive case-based learning with ECHO were ultimately able to manage their patients as well as or better than the university specialty clinic (2) . There are now at least 825 ECHO programs addressing a broad range of disease states and conditions, based in 48 states and 39 countries (3), with many more to come. These are operated by entities that include universities, institutions, societies, and organizations who have replicated and adapted the ECHO model of learning based on community needs and resources. The skills necessary to launch and maintain an ECHO program can be acquired through no-cost \"Immersion training\" provided at UNMHSC and in other countries, and now available in an online format. The full resources of Project ECHO are available to ECHO \"partners,\" including use of the Zoom (Zoom Video Communications, Inc, San Jose, CA) videoconferencing platform. When COVID-19 infections were recognized as a global crisis, Project ECHO responded by temporarily redeploying all staff to activities devoted to best practice COVID-19 care for public health officials, scientists, and frontline healthcare workers in the USA and abroad.",

Bone Health TeleECHO is an online community of practice composed of healthcare professionals with an interest in the care of patients with skeletal diseases. Participants represent a diverse mix of urban and rural providers from many medical specialties and practice settings connecting with weekly videoconferences using Zoom.

It remains uncertain when, if ever, potential attendees will resume these traditional ways of learning. Project ECHO addresses these issues by allowing healthcare professionals to have virtual interactive meetings, with CME, to learn from one another without the need for travel and gathering in large groups.

ECHO provides a unique opportunity to discuss cases with many providers with expertise in the field. In university settings, ongoing case conferences have been postponed or canceled during the pandemic. This, coupled with the closure of many medical offices and accelerations in virtual visits has left many providers feeling isolated in terms of their ability to care for complex patients. Project ECHO improves patient care by empowering participating healthcare professionals with specialty-level knowledge that can be applied to many patients. By doing so, it complements care provided by telemedicine and acts as a force multiplier that can reach many patients.",
