            "text": "Double-stranded (ds) DNA viruses are often described as evolving through long-term codivergent associations with their hosts, a pattern that is expected to be associated with low rates of nucleotide substitution. However, the hypothesis of codivergence between dsDNA viruses and their hosts has rarely been rigorously tested, even though the vast majority of nucleotide substitution rate estimates for dsDNA viruses are based upon this assumption. It is therefore important to estimate the evolutionary rates of dsDNA viruses independent of the assumption of host-virus codivergence. Here, we explore the use of temporally structured sequence data within a Bayesian framework to estimate the evolutionary rates for seven human dsDNA viruses, including variola virus (VARV) (the causative agent of smallpox) and herpes simplex virus-1. Our analyses reveal that although the VARV genome is likely to evolve at a rate of approximately 1 \u00c2 10 \u00c05 substitutions/ site/year and hence approaching that of many RNA viruses, the evolutionary rates of many other dsDNA viruses remain problematic to estimate. Synthetic data sets were constructed to inform our interpretation of the substitution rates estimated for these dsDNA viruses and the analysis of these demonstrated that given a sequence data set of appropriate length and sampling depth, it is possible to use time-structured analyses to estimate the substitution rates of many dsDNA viruses independently from the assumption of host-virus codivergence. Finally, the discovery that some dsDNA viruses may evolve at rates approaching those of RNA viruses has important implications for our understanding of the long-term evolutionary history and emergence potential of this major group of viruses.",

            "text": "The relationships between pathogens and their hosts are highly variable, ranging from newly emergent zoonotic infections such as SARS coronavirus (Peiris et al. 2004 ) to codivergent associations that span millions of years, like those seen in the papillomaviruses (Bernard et al. 2006) . Recently, a concerted effort has been made to unravel the phylogenetic and demographic contexts that have led to this diversity of relationships (P\u00e9rez-Losada et al. 2007; Rector et al. 2007; Katzourakis et al. 2009; Smith et al. 2009 ). In particular, methodological advances have enabled the incorporation of temporal information from time-structured sequence data into strict or relaxed molecular clock models (Drummond et al. , 2006 Drummond and Rambaut 2007) , which can then be used to estimate the timing of epidemiologically important events (cross-species transmissions, epidemic outbreaks), as well as historically important ones (the origin of multiple viral subtypes, host-pathogen codivergence). RNA viruses are particularly well suited to analyses of this type as their rapid replication rate, large population sizes, and error-prone polymerase result in large amounts of genetic diversity being generated in measurable amounts of evolutionary time. Sequence analysis programs such as Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis By Sampling Trees (BEAST) are of particular importance in this regard as they utilize the genetic variation present in a sample to simultaneously estimate both demographic and evolutionary parameters in the context of time and space (Drummond et al. , 2006 Drummond and Rambaut 2007; Lemey et al. 2009 ).",

            "text": "Codivergence with host species over thousands or millions of years has often been invoked as the primary evolutionary mechanism shaping the diversity of many DNA (and some RNA) viruses (Beer et al. 1999; Charrel et al. 1999; Sugimoto et al. 2002; Nemirov et al. 2004 ). Importantly, inferences about key aspects of viral biology including the rate of evolutionary change in the viral genome and the timescale of speciation events, have often been made based on the assumption of host-virus codivergence, which automatically places the evolution of these viruses on the same scale as their hosts (Nakao et al. 1997; Hughes and Friedman 2000; Sugimoto et al. 2002; Nishimoto et al. 2006; Krumbholz et al. 2008) . However, by incorporating timing information from time-sampled (heterochronous) sequences into inferences about the history of viral populations, it is possible to generate independent estimates of the rate and timescale of virus evolution, without requiring the strong assumption of codivergence. Critically, analyses of this type have demonstrated that some host-virus systems that were once thought to be examples of codivergence may in fact be the result of much more recent evolutionary associations (Shackelton et al. 2006; Romano et al. 2008; Harkins et al. 2009; Lewis-Rogers and Crandall 2009; Ramsden et al. 2009 ).",

For example, a time-dependent relationship has been demonstrated to exist for the molecular clock, such that molecular evolution is accelerated on short timescales (Ho et al. 2005; Ho and Larson 2006; Ho, Kolokotronis, and Allaby 2007; Ho, Shapiro, et al. 2007) . Concerns have also been raised regarding the tendency of inference tools to recover substitution rates that are too rapid when population structure in the data is unaccounted for or when inappropriate calibration points are used (Ho et al. 2008; Navascues and Emerson 2009) . Ascribing times to samples and accommodating these in analyses are effectively an assertion that these times span a consequential proportion of the total evolutionary history of the taxa in question and conditions the analysis on rates that are sufficiently high that this is true. Such analyses have been used extensively to estimate the evolutionary and epidemiological characteristics of a wide range of rapidly evolving RNA and single-stranded DNA viruses and appear to return estimates that accord well with the known epidemiology of these pathogens (Shackelton et al. 2005; de Oliveira et al. 2006; Bryant et al. 2007; Rambaut et al. 2008; Firth et al. 2009 ). However, the utility of these methods in estimating the evolutionary dynamics of double-stranded (ds) DNA viruses, which may evolve far more slowly than RNA viruses, has not yet been investigated. Indeed, the use of heterochronous phylogenetic modeling has resulted in surprisingly high evolutionary rate estimates for JC virus (Shackelton et al. 2006) , variola virus (VARV) (Li et al. 2007) , and the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae (P\u00e9rez-Losada et al. 2007) .",

Indeed, Rector et al. (2007) suggest that dsDNA viruses are inappropriate for time-structured analyses because their low mutation rates (;0.003 mutations/genome/replication, Drake 1991; Drake and Hwang 2005; Duffy et al. 2008 ) will lead to immeasurable levels of genetic change over a given sampling interval. This raises the possibility that the high rates of evolutionary change previously reported for dsDNA viruses arise spuriously, and possibly inevitably, from the models employed. However, if no measurable evolutionary change has occurred within a given sampling period, we would expect any analytical outcomes to exhibit behavior consistent with a lack of temporal structure in the data. Here, we use a variety of human dsDNA virus systems to investigate the ability of heterochronous phylogenetic modeling to 1) accurately estimate the fit of a molecular clock to dsDNA virus data sets with varying sample sizes and distributions, 2) recover the correct nucleotide substitution rate or reveal that there is a lack of temporal structure in the data, and 3) place the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of these viruses within the correct time frame (when known). To further assess the behavior of these analytical tools, we created synthetic data sets under a variety of sampling schemes and substitution rates, from an ''RNA viruslike'' rate of 1 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 substitutions per site per year (subs/ site/year) to a ''dsDNA virus-like'' rate of 1 \u00c2 10 \u00c08 subs/ site/year. Using these data, we examined the ability of standard modeling tools to recover the nucleotide substitution rate and TMRCA from a population when the true evolutionary history of a sample is known.",

The rate of nucleotide substitution for HPV-18 has been estimated at ;4.5 \u00c2 10 \u00c0 7 subs/site/year based on codivergence with human populations, similar to estimates obtained for the feline papillomaviruses (1.95 \u00c2 10 \u00c08 subs/site/year), again assuming codivergence (Ong et al. 1993; Rector et al. 2007) .",

However, this extremely recent estimate has been disregarded as being at odds with both historical/epidemiological data and with the low genetic diversity identified in serially sampled sequences (Esposito et al. 2006; Li et al. 2007) . As a result, these authors have suggested that their evolutionary rate estimates may be upwardly biased by the use of heterochronous phylogenetic models. In contrast, calibration with historical records of smallpox infection (all of which are debatable) placed the TMRCA for VARV at 1,400-6,300 ybp, depending on the choice of calibration point, with correspondingly lower substitution rates (Li et al. 2007; Babkin and Shchelkunov 2008; Hughes et al. 2009; Shchelkunov 2009 ). Importantly, any calibration of contemporary strains using historical records is potentially problematic as selective sweeps and population bottlenecks can purge genetic diversity from the population, resulting in a TMRCA that is far more recent than the historical association of the virus with its host.",

A variety of prior probability distributions on the parameter characterizing the rate of evolutionary change under a molecular clock were explored.

Synthetic data sets were generated to reflect the evolutionary processes in two of the seven dsDNA data sets analyzed, VARV and HSV-1, which represent the typical range one might encounter in an analysis of temporally sampled data (table 1). The VARV-like synthetic data consisted of 50 sequences of 100,000 bp sampled from 1946 to 1982 (similar to a full-genome alignment), whereas the HSV-1-like synthetic data consisted of 84 sequences that were 1,200 bp in length, sampled from 1981 to 2008 (a typical single-gene alignment). Sequences for each data set were generated in the following manner. The yearof-sampling distribution associated with the sequences was fixed to those values from the VARV and HSV-1 data sets, and random phylogenies were drawn from a coalescent process based on each group of taxa (N 5 50 or 84) using an MCMC algorithm and assuming a constant population size. The root height for each phylogeny was fixed at one of the following intervals: 100, 1,000, 10,000, 100,000, and 1,000,000 ybp. Sequences of the appropriate length were simulated along each random tree following the HKY model of sequence evolution with data set-specific base frequencies and transition/transversion ratios based on the ML estimate of these values from the actual virus data sets. Gamma-distributed rate variation was also initially added to the HSV-1-like simulations, but as the inclusion of this parameter did not impact the results of the simulations, it was removed from additional replications (data not shown). For the first set of synthetic data, the rate of evolution followed a strict molecular clock (standard deviation [SD] around the mean rate of 0.0) set at one of the following values corresponding to each specified value of the root height: 1 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 subs/site/year (when the root height was 100 ybp), 1 \u00c2 10 \u00c05 subs/site/year, 1 \u00c2 10 \u00c06 subs/site/year, 1 \u00c2 10 \u00c07 subs/site/year, and 1 \u00c2 10 \u00c08 subs/ site/year (when the root height was one million ybp). Twenty independent replicate data sets were created for each root height/clock rate and each virus type. These synthetic data sets contained a similar number of variant sites to the actual data sets, indicating that we were correctly modeling the true pattern of evolution (data not shown). By covarying the tree height and substitution rate in this manner, the observed genetic diversity of each synthetic data set was held constant and similar to that observed in the VARV and HSV-1 data sets. This allowed for a direct assessment of the power of this method to estimate substitution rates under successive conditions in which smaller proportions of overall genetic diversity can be attributed to the sampling interval. Posterior inference was performed on each data set assuming a strict molecular clock, the HKY model of nucleotide substitution and constant population size. MCMC simulations were run for 100 million generations, with subsampling every 10,000 generations. Convergence of all parameters was verified visually using the program Tracer (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/ tracer/).",

No substantial differences in the posterior estimates of the mean evolutionary rates were observed when the initial values or prior distribution of the rate parameter were varied. The mean evolutionary rates estimated for the seven dsDNA virus data sets ranged from 10 \u00c06 to 10 \u00c03 subs/site/year (VARV/VZ and HPV-16, respectively) (table 2). The 95% HPDs ranged from 10 \u00c07 (human adenovirus subtype-C [HAdV-C]) to 10 \u00c02 subs/site/year (HPV-16) and varied by no more than an order of magnitude from their corresponding posterior mean in either direction (table 2) . Interestingly, with the exception of HPV-16, the mean evolutionary rates estimated were also highly consistent across data sets, ranging from 6 \u00c2 10 \u00c06 to 8 \u00c2 10 \u00c05 subs/site/year. These estimates were highly robust to choice of clock, rate distribution, or demographic model parameters but were much higher than expected based on previous estimates of the substitution rate of dsDNA viruses (table 2) (Bernard 1994; Duffy et al. 2008) . In fact, the evolutionary rates estimated for HPV-16, HSV-1, BK virus, human adenovirus subtype-B (HAdV-B), and HAdV-C all approached those measured in RNA viruses (Jenkins et al. 2002; Duffy et al. 2008 ). In addition, these high rates were associated with extremely recent TMRCA estimates in all cases, ranging from ;10 (HPV-16) to ;800 ybp (BK) (table 2) . Most dsDNA viruses are thought to evolve primarily through codivergence with their hosts, and this process should be reflected in low rates of evolutionary change (Villarreal et al. 2000; Holmes 2004; Holmes and Drummond 2007) . If we allow that the seven dsDNA viruses used in this study do indeed evolve at a low rate consistent with a codivergent history (an assumption that is not contentious in many cases), the possibility must be considered that the high substitution rates estimated here are the result of estimation error and do not reflect the true evolutionary history of the data. As it is possible that such erroneous results are due to a shallow sampling interval relative to the actual timescale of evolution ( fig. 1) , we assessed the strength of the temporal structure in our data sets by utilizing a randomization procedure.",

This is dependent on the length of sequence, and for a data set containing only a small number of informative nucleotide sites (as in the case of HSV-1), the temporal signal in the data begins to break down at evolutionary rates below 1 \u00c2 10 \u00c05 subs/site/year (figs. 4 and 5). In these cases, the sampling interval is probably too small relative to the rate of evolution of the virus. Therefore, any substitution rate estimated using these types of data will likely not converge on the true rate but will instead return a wide posterior distribution of the rate that tends toward zero ( fig. 5 ). This behavior is also likely to be robust to a poor fit to the molecular clock (e.g., the use of a strict clock with highly rate-variable data) and can be interpreted as an indication that the data are not appropriate for a temporal analysis by a program such as BEAST.",

This strongly suggests that there is insufficient temporal structure in these data to undertake an analysis of the nucleotide substitution rate in the absence of external calibration points. However, a very different pattern was seen in the HSV-1, BK, VARV, and HAdV-B data sets ( fig. 4) . Here, analysis of the observed data sets resulted in high substitution rate estimates associated with tight 95% HPDs, a pattern that we were unable to reproduce using the synthetic data even with the inclusion of large amounts of branch-rate heterogeneity (i.e., when applying a SD of 2.0 log 10 to the mean clock rate). As such, extensive rate heterogeneity across the phylogeny is unlikely to explain the high substitution rates observed in these viruses, and we are therefore unable to justify the high rates of evolution measured for some of these dsDNA viruses by simply invoking estimation error. The analysis of contemporaneously sampled, slowly evolving viruses results in a posterior distribution that reveals the lack of structure in the data, a phenomenon unlike the posterior distributions recovered from the analysis of these viruses. Hence, our simulations support the conclusion that VARV is evolving at a rate close to 1 \u00c2 10 \u00c05 subs/site/year and indicates that there is no obvious flaw in the analysis of the HSV-1, BK, and HAdV-B data sets that could result in erroneous substitution rate estimates. Therefore, we accept high rates of evolution in VARV and tentatively suggest FIG. 4 . Substitution rates (posterior mean and 95% HPD) estimated from synthetic data sets based on the VARV and HSV-1 data sets from the first part of this study.

Accordingly, the choice of calibration points has dramatically influenced many of these estimates, resulting in an approximate TMRCA for VARV ranging from 200 to 6,000 ybp, with correspondingly variable substitution rates (Li et al. 2007; Babkin and Shchelkunov 2008; Shchelkunov 2009 ).

The first is that epidemiologically linked isolates appear to accumulate no mutational changes over the period of 1 year (Li et al. 2007 ). However, it is also theoretically possible to explain this observation by invoking selective sweeps or severe population bottlenecks during transmission, which act to reduce the variability accrued during replication in a single individual. The second factor opposing high evolutionary rates for VARV is the suggestion of congruence between historical records of the introduction and spread of the virus in various locations, and the TMRCAs estimated for the major VARV clades.

In particular, these epidemiological records do not necessarily correlate with the true origin or introduction of a pathogen, as revealed by the different dates used for the same introductions of VARV in multiple locations, and the last common ancestor of any contemporaneously sampled set of viruses may be of more recent origin than the common ancestor of the entire species (Hughes et al. 2009; Shchelkunov 2009 ). Calibrating evolutionary analyses using a time point that predates the age of the most recent common ancestor of a sample will bias the substitution rate and divergence date estimates toward a much older history (and correspondingly lower substitution rates). In contrast, the current analysis only estimates the TMRCA of the sample, not of VARV itself, and may therefore return TMRCA estimates more recent than the known age of this human pathogen, particularly if there has been a large-scale reduction in diversity (i.e., selective sweep or population bottleneck) in the recent history of VARV. Although we cannot exclude all estimation errors in the case of VARV, the high level of genetic variation in our data explained by temporal sampling (R 2 5 0.68) lends support to the existence of rapid evolutionary rates in VARV (Hughes et al. 2009 , this study).",

However, the substitution rate for herpesviruses such as HSV-1 has not previously been measured independently from the hypothesis of codivergence. A key measure of the evolutionary rate of herpesviruses originated from the analysis of 63 variable restriction endonuclease sites in 242 HSV-1 samples from three human populations represented by six countries: Asian (Korea, Japan, and China), African (Kenya), and European (Sweden and the United States) (Sakaoka et al. 1994) . Based on rough estimates of the divergence times between these ethnic groups (110,000 years for the split between African and European/Asian populations and 50,000 years for the split of Asian from European groups) and the nucleotide differences between them, a substitution rate of 3.5 \u00c2 10 \u00c08 subs/site/year was estimated (Sakaoka et al. 1994 ). This rate is two-to-three orders of magnitude lower than any of the substitution rates we estimate here, including that of HSV-1 and VARV (table 2) . Hughes et al. (2009) suggested previously that the HSV-1 rate of Sakaoka et al. (1994) might be too low given the substitution rates estimated for VARV. However, a genespecific mutation rate of approximately 2 \u00c2 10 \u00c08 mutations/site/replication has been experimentally derived for the thymidine kinase gene of HSV-1 (the same gene analyzed here), an estimate congruent with both the substitution rate estimated by Sakaoka et al. (1994) and for dsDNA viruses generally (Drake 1991; Lu et al. 2002; Drake and Hwang 2005) .",

The most likely mechanism through which such an inflated substitution rate could occur is through strong and continuous positive selection. To test for the presence of positive selection within our HSV-1 thymidine kinase gene alignment, the overall ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions per site (d N /d S ) was estimated using the program HyPhy (Kosakovsky Pond et al. 2005) . The d N /d S ratio for this data set was 0.700, consistent with either localized positive selection on some codons or perhaps a substantial relaxation of purifying selection on this gene, as has been previously suggested (Drake and Hwang 2005) . Hence, although positive selection may be contributing to the high substitution rates estimated for this gene, it seems highly unlikely that such adaptive evolution could result in a substitution rate that is three orders of magnitude higher than expected. We are therefore unable to conclusively reconcile the high substitution rates estimated here for HSV-1 (and potentially the related VZ virus), with what is known about the background mutation rate and biology of herpesviruses. At the very least, our HSV-1 analysis strongly suggests that future research should focus on acquiring sufficient herpesvirus data to allow for a rigorous estimate of the substitution and replication rates of these viruses, independent from any assumption of codivergence.",

            "text": "Clearly, the high rates of molecular evolution we have measured here for all seven dsDNA viruses are not easily explained by the understood biology of these (and other) dsDNA viruses. However, we cannot simply attribute the remarkably similar rate estimates across the seven viruses to an error in the method of estimation, as we were unable to recover comparably high estimates from the analysis of our synthetic data sets. Although we have little confidence in the rates estimated for some of our data sets (HAdV-C, VZ, HPV-16), others are suggestive of high substitution rates in dsDNA viruses (VARV, HAdV-B, and perhaps HSV-1 and BK) and clearly merit further investigation. It is possible to identify two general mechanisms that may Firth et al. \u00b7 doi:10.1093/molbev/msq088 MBE be driving the substitution rate of these viruses above the background mutation rate (;2 \u00c2 10 \u00c08 to 7 \u00c2 10 \u00c07 mutations/site/replication, Drake et al. 1998) . First, as the rate of viral replication directly impacts the long-term substitution rate (this parameter is analogous to generation time), very high replication rates have the potential to inflate the substitution rates of dsDNA viruses (McLysaght et al. 2003; Gubser et al. 2004; Esposito et al. 2006; Hughes et al. 2009 ). The impact of high replication rates may be particularly important for those viruses that are highly transmissible and/or result in acute infections in humans (VARV, HAdV-B) but are unlikely to have a similar effect in those viruses causing asymptomatic, latent, and/or chronic infections (BK, HSV-1) in the host. Unfortunately, the replication rates of these viruses during natural infections in the host are unknown. Second, as discussed in the context of HSV-1, strong (diversifying) positive selection could also act to increase the substitution rate above the (neutral) mutation rate. Positive selection is most likely to be observed in viruses that cause a strong immune response in the host or are the target of intense vaccination or intervention campaigns. However, as with replication rates, relatively little is known about the extent and nature of adaptive evolution in dsDNA viruses, although to date positive selection has not been identified in the protein-coding genes of VARV (Hughes et al. 2009 ).",

When the sampling interval is similar to the time frame over which sequence evolution occurs (10 \u00c04 subs/site/year), it is possible to assess the long-term rate of evolution with high precision (a). When the sampling interval is small relative to the time frame of sequence evolution (10 \u00c08 subs/site/year), it may become difficult to accurately estimate substitution rates (b). The scale bars indicate the branch lengths in number of years.FIG. 2.
