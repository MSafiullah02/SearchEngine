Despite an improved understanding of molecular mechanisms and advances in supportive care strategies, ARDS remains associated with high mortality, and survivors usually face longterm morbidity. In recent years, preclinical studies have provided mounting evidence of the potential of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based therapies in lung diseases and critical illnesses. In several models of ARDS, MSCs have been demonstrated to induce antiinflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects, improve epithelial and endothelial cell recovery, and enhance microbial and alveolar fluid clearance, thus resulting in improved lung and distal organ function and survival. Early-stage clinical trials have also demonstrated the safety of MSC administration in patients with ARDS, but further, large-scale investigations are required to assess the safety and efficacy profile of these therapies. In this review, we summarize the main mechanisms whereby MSCs have been shown to exert therapeutic effects in experimental ARDS. We also highlight questions that need to be further elucidated and barriers that must be overcome in order to efficiently translate MSC research into clinical practice.",

They have lower tumorigenic potential than embryonic stem cells and can be rapidly expanded ex vivo, which enables their clinical use in single-or multiple-dose regimens (Weiss et al. 2011) . MSCs also exert immunomodulatory actions without the need for host-recipient matching, thus allowing their use in either autologous or allogeneic transplantation. MSCs exhibit low expression of HLA type I; HLA type II exists intracellularly but is absent on the cell surface. When cells are preconditioned with interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, HLA type II can traffic to the cell surface, but MSCs still evade recognition by alloreactive T cells (Le Blanc et al. 2003) . Finally, MSCs can detect specifically injured environments and tailor their responses accordingly, which provides an advantage for their use in many diseases (Mathieu and Loboa 2012; Galleu et al. 2017; Leuning et al. 2018; de Castro et al. 2019; Islam et al. 2019) .",

Some postulated mechanisms include cell contact-dependent actions and secretion of paracrine or endocrine factors, which act on nearby cells or travel through the blood to exert their effects. Regardless of whether by contact-dependent or contact-independent mechanisms, MSC administration has been shown to result in anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic effects, enhanced epithelial and endothelial cell recovery, microbial and alveolar fluid clearance, and, ultimately, reductions in multiple organ injury and mortality (Fig. 2) . Notably, although many experimental studies have used vehicle (regular saline or phosphatebuffered saline) as a negative control, no therapeutic benefits were observed when fibroblasts were used as a negative control cell population, indicating that only Fig. 1 The pathogenesis cascade of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) begins with an insult that causes disruption of alveolar-capillary integrity. The alveolar epithelium is the first structure injured in pulmonary ARDS, while endothelial cells are the first structure injured in extrapulmonary ARDS. The loss of alveolar-capillary integrity leads to increased proinflammatory cell infiltration, edema, and tissue remodeling, resulting in impairment of lung function MSCs have the ability to induce such therapeutic benefits (McIntyre et al. 2016) .",

            "text": "Pathogen-and damage-associated molecular patterns trigger pro-inflammatory responses by resident epithelial and vascular endothelial cells, which results in influx of inflammatory cells and tissue injury. Administration of MSCs either intratracheally or intravenously has been demonstrated to mitigate inflammation by reducing levels of several inflammatory mediators, including interleukin (IL)-1-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, IFN-\u03b3, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1, MIP-2, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, while also increasing levels of anti-inflammatory and pro-resolution factors, such as IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RN), IL-10, prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ), lipoxin A 4 (LXA 4 ), and TNF-inducible gene (TSG)-6. Such findings were observed in lung tissue homogenates, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, plasma, and distal organs in distinct models of experimental ARDS (Table 2) . A transcription network analysis also revealed that MSC administration may induce downregulation of endotoxin/toll-like receptor (TLR)-innate immune pro-inflammatory responses, while upregulating nuclear factor of activated T cell (NFAT)-related genes, which indicates a shift from innate to adaptive immune responses (dos Santos et al. 2012) . Importantly, the anti-inflammatory effects of MSCs have been mostly attributed to paracrine/endocrine mechanisms, as few to no donor-derived cells localize at the host lung tissue after MSC therapy, and MSC-conditioned media has also been shown to decrease pro-inflammatory mediator levels and cell counts in many ARDS models. In this line, certain therapeutic benefits induced by MSCs have been correlated to their ability to produce extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are membrane vesicles ubiquitously secreted by cells. EVs can carry small, messenger, and other RNAs, as well as proteins, lipids, and organelles, which can alter gene MSCs can induce upregulation of TSG-6, a potent anti-inflammatory mediator that inhibits neutrophilia by suppressing CXCL8-mediated chemotaxis (Danchuk et al. 2011; Dyer et al. 2014 ). In a model of zymosaninduced peritonitis, macrophage-produced TNF-\u03b1 stimulated MSCs to produce TSG-6, which acted as a negative feedback loop on macrophage inflammatory signaling . Knockdown of TSG-6 expression in MSCs has demonstrated to abrogate several antiinflammatory actions of MSC therapy in experimental models of endotoxin-induced lung injury (Danchuk et al. 2011) . MSCs also reduced tissue injury by inhibiting formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (Pedrazza et al. 2017) . Furthermore, MSC therapy can induce production of IL-1RN to protect lung tissue against bleomycin-induced injury by blocking the production and/or activity of IL-1\u03b1 and TNF-\u03b1 (Ortiz et al. 2007) . Repeated administration of cell therapy also prevented disease progression by mitigating expression of IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-1R1, while enhancing expression of IL-1RN, in experimental silicosis-induced lung injury (Lopes-Pacheco et al. 2013 ).",

MSC therapy has been demonstrated to significantly reduce bacterial load in animal models of infection induced by Escherichia coli (Cai et al. 2015; Devaney et al. 2015) , Pseudomonas aeruginosa Asmussen et al. 2014) , Staphylococcus aureus (Qian et al. 2016) , and polymicrobial sepsis (Gonzalez-Rey et al. 2009; N\u00e9meth et al. 2009; Alcayaga-Miranda et al. 2015) , as well as in an ex vivo perfused human lung model (Lee et al. 2013) . Such effects appeared to be mediated by secretion of antimicrobial peptides, including LL-37 (Krasnodembskaya et al. 2010 ) and lipocalin-2 (Gupta et al. 2012) , since antimicrobial actions were abrogated when neutralizing antibodies were used. Secretion of \u03b2-defensin-2 via TLR4 signaling has also been implicated in MSCinduced bacterial clearance (Sung et al. 2016 ). Furthermore, MSCs have been shown to reduce bacterial load in vivo by enhancing the phagocytic activity of macrophages (Mei et al. 2010; Lee et al. 2013 ) and monocytes . In both in vivo and in vitro models, MSCs also enhanced phagocytic activity of macrophages and monocytes by promoting mitochondrial transfer via tunneling nanotubes, thus resulting in a more effective bacterial clearance (Jackson et al. 2016 ).",

Moreover, in many experimental protocols, MSCs were administered before, at the time of, or only a few hours after disease induction; these models fail to take into account the time course of lung and distal organ injury and, therefore, do not resemble the clinical situation.",

            "text": "Although bone marrow has been the most common source used to obtain MSCs (McIntyre et al. 2016) , an invasive harvesting procedure is required, and these cells have limited availability. Furthermore, experimental ARDS has been shown to modify the profile of the bone marrow cell population, affecting their immunomodulatory effects and limiting their potential use for autologous transplantation (Silva et al. 2014; Antebi et al. 2018) . MSCs from different sources have been intensively investigated, as these cells exhibit differences in gene expression and stability, secretome, and cell surface proteins, which may impact on their survival and regenerative properties (Ostanin et al. 2011; Nora et al. 2012; Elahi et al. 2016; Heo et al. 2016) . However, few studies have comparatively evaluated the effects of MSCs from different sources (Nystedt et al. 2013; Chao et al. 2014; Silva et al. 2018a) , and whether cells from any one source may provide superior therapeutic responses remains unclear. In addition, cell dosing has meaningful clinical relevance and remains under-investigated, as clinical trials conducted to date have focused on safety, with efficacy as a secondary assessment. MSCs have been administered as a single dose ranging from 5 \u00d7 10 4 to 3.6 \u00d7 10 7 cells in experimental models (McIntyre et al. 2016) . From a translational perspective, this range in a 25-g mouse would correspond to 2 \u00d7 10 6 to 1.44 \u00d7 10 9 cells kg \u22121 (or 150 million to 108 billion cells for a 75-kg human). Such quantities are technically and operationally challenging, and administration of high doses of MSCs is associated with several safety concerns. To date, 1 \u00d7 10 7 cells kg \u22121 is the highest dose ever used in clinical studies. As in pharmacological research, determination of the therapeutic window and index for MSC therapies is a critical step that should be further characterized in experimental studies to ensure that the greatest therapeutic benefits can be achieved without resulting in side effects in the clinical setting. MSC administration has been performed by either local or systemic routes in different experimental models. While local administration (e.g., intratracheal) delivers cells directly to the site of injury, systemic administration (e.g., intravenous) allows wide distribution throughout the body. However, MSCs administered intravenously are subjected to the pulmonary first-pass effect (Fischer et al. 2009 ), which results in significant retention of cells. In fact, this effect may offer an advantage for lung tissue repair. Although ongoing clinical trials and most number of experimental studies have used the intravenous route (McIntyre et al. 2016) , therapeutic responses were similar in the few studies that compared different routes for MSC delivery in animal models (Curley et al. 2013; Alcayaga-Miranda et al. 2015; Devaney et al. 2015) . Importantly, ECMO has become an increasingly common therapeutic modality for patients with severe ARDS (Bellani et al. 2016; Papazian et al. 2019) . In an ex vivo model, MSCs administered intravascularly were found to adhere to membrane oxygenator fibers during ECMO, resulting in a significant reduction of flow through the circuit (Millar et al. 2019) . Further investigations should be performed with alternative routes of administration, such as intrabronchial, to identify which would be a viable option for this clinical situation. Finally, most experimental studies have focused on short-term effects of MSC therapy; evaluation of long-term effects has been comparatively neglected. Although a single dose of MSCs has been shown to result in therapeutic responses, more than one dose may be required to induce a more efficient tissue repair or even to maintain benefits, as observed in animal models of elastase-induced emphysema and silicosis (Lopes-Pacheco et al. 2013; Poggio et al. 2018) .",

Under hypoxic conditions, MSCs have been shown to upregulate expression of genes related to pro-survival, anti-apoptotic, antioxidant signaling, resulting in reduction of fibrosis and expression of pro-inflammatory mediators in a model of bleomycin-induced lung injury (Lan et al. 2015) . In experimental sepsis, MSC preconditioning with poly (I:C), a TLR3 ligand, inhibited expression of miR-143 and increased expression of cyclooxygenase-2, resulting in increased PGE 2 production and macrophage antiinflammatory actions (Zhao et al. 2014 ). Compared to na\u00efve MSCs, eicosapentaenoic acid-preconditioned MSCs induced further reduction in lung inflammation and remodeling as well as in lung and distal organ injury, thus resulting in greater improvement in severity score and survival in CLP-induced experimental sepsis (Silva et al. 2019b) . Other studies have also demonstrated enhancement of therapeutic effects by inducing overexpression of certain genes by MSCs, including Ang-1 (Mei et al. 2007 , and HGF (Meng et al. 2019) . As the degree of therapeutic outcomes can differ depending on disease severity, etiology, and primary insult, different preconditioning approaches may provide a more appropriate MSC therapy according to the disease features of each patient, thus driving more effective therapeutic and regenerative responses.",

The benefits of MSC-based therapies appeared to be induced by complex, well-orchestrated signaling pathways rather than by any one (or few) mechanisms. Key mechanisms of action include secretion of paracrine and endocrine factors as well as transfer of cellular contents via extracellular vesicles or cell-to-cell contact.",

The possibility of enhancing the benefits of MSCs by preconditioning methods has brought novel opportunities that should be further explored. Safety results from phase I and II clinical trials are encouraging, but the safety and efficacy profile has yet to be proven in large-scale trials. In an ideal clinical scenario, MSCs would be promptly available and obtained through well-standardized procedures, but some barriers still pose challenges to the feasibility of MSC therapy. ",
