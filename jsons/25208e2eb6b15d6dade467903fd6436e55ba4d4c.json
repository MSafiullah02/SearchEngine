We were pleased to find that a recent article in this journal attempted to utilize the largest (n = 2143) study of severity of COVID-19 in identified pediatric cases [1] to highlight the impact of COVID-19 in children [2] . Unfortunately, the author's failure to account for the large number of undetected cases present in the population-at-risk in Dong et al.'s study results in severity estimates that are highly inflated and an interactive spreadsheet model whose resultant projections of the numbers of severe and critically ill pediatric cases of COVID-19 are implausible and inconsistent with available evidence.",

            "text": "The ability to estimate the number of children in a given population who will have severe COVID-19 illness is dependent upon three numbers: (1) the number of children at risk in the population, (2) the infection proportion, or percentage of the population at risk who will be infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and (3) the severity proportion, or the percentage of those infected who will develop severe illness. The author's projections hinge upon his estimates of the severity proportion. Using infants (< 1 year) as an example, the author divides the severe/critical infant cases reported in Dong et al. (n = 40) by the total infants included in the study (n = 379), resulting in a severity proportion of 10.6%. However, this severity proportion cannot be directly applied to populations-at-risk, because it has not been corrected for case underascertainment. Case underascertainment results from the inability of governments to provide universal testing. In our recently published peer-reviewed study [3] , we used data from Dong et al. to project numbers of severe and critical pediatric cases in the United States in 2020. We adjusted for both general population case underascertainment using the modelling results of Li et al. [4] , and for the lower case ascertainment in children compared with adults reported by Ferguson et al. [5] . We also conservatively assume that none of the undetected cases would have had severe disease because such illness would have likely resulted in detection. Accounting for both underascertainment factors yields a severity proportion for infants that is calculated as 40/3662, or 1.1%. This more accurately estimates the desired denominator (all children infected with SARS-CoV-2).",

In contrast, our study projects 40,000 and 4346 with severe and critical illness, respectively. Failure to adjust for case underascertainment results in 20-fold overestimates of the anticipated burden of COVID-19 disease in children. The four experts who peer reviewed our manuscript all emphasized the importance of 'getting the denominator right' for this exact reason.",

As such, severity (and criticality) may be further overestimated in the author's projections by the inclusion of both suspected and confirmed cases.",
