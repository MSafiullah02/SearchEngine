The potential exposures from the time of the initial presentations until diagnosis and alert are indicative of the danger associated with a bioterrorism event.

Planning for military deployments includes setting contingencies for such epidemics. This is especially true in settings such as Iraq and Afghanistan where the environment can include sandstorms, extreme heat and cold, working in tents, and questionable sanitation facilities. Responding to such an event would primarily center on providing a large facility or tent to house patients suspected of having avian flu. Unused buildings or tents with water and sanitation equipment could be quickly converted into isolation and treatment centers.

Preventive medicine, infection control, infectious disease, veterinary and medical, and nursing personnel all play a part in developing a coherent plan to limit the spread of disease and protect the population. In many instances, coordination among available resources simply does not occur. For instance, many nongovernment relief organizations do not always coordinate their activities or experience with the larger operation.

The preventive medicine (PM) officer on the air base assessed the situation and realized that the task of protecting the personnel demanded a more focused approach. The first action was to determine who could assist. Assistance was found from personnel in other units and from coalition forces. For example, the PM officer implemented a program to protect the military personnel assigned to the area by bringing together the infection prevention and control nurse, a PM technician from another US military unit, the Veterinarian Detachments, an Australian infectious disease physician, and a Romanian NBC (nuclear, biological, chemical) decontamination unit. These actions were highly effective. An outbreak of meningitis in the Iraqi Army camp was contained, a sexually transmitted disease problem was identified and eliminated, and a hospital interpreter was screened and treated for tuberculosis. In addition, the veterinarians dealt with an increasing intrusion of wild animals onto the base that could have posed a serious health issue for the base population.",
