            "text": "Human adenovirus (HAdV) is a double-stranded DNA virus and a common pathogen among children and adults. HAdV belongs to the Adenoviridae family and the Mastadenovirus genus. The link between HAdVs and respiratory tract infections (RTIs) is well established [[1], [2], [3]], especially in children and military recruits. They may also cause epidemic keratoconjunctivitis and gastroenteritis. More rarely, HAdV infections may lead to haemorrhagic cystitis [4,5]. Severe disease in immunodeficient patients, children and elderly has also been documented [[6], [7], [8]]. Infections with adenovirus may occur sporadically or in epidemics and can be detected throughout the year. However, it is a well-known phenomenon that asymptomatic shedding can occur [9,10]. Until now more than 52 HAdV types have been identified and further classified into seven species (A\u2013G). The different types were initially defined by serum neutralisation methods as serotype, but are now identified based on molecular methods and named as genotypes. New genotypes are still identified [8,[11], [12], [13], [14]].",

Viral culture is labour intensive and does not provide a fast answer for clinical decision-making, but we think that it is a useful laboratory tool for the evaluation of nucleic-acid based methods. Approximately half of the HAdV DNA positive NPAs collected from children with RTI were also positive by virus isolation, and we suggest that this indication of live viral particles support that active adenoviral infection was present. In addition, many of these samples with HAdV growth had high viral loads. More than 9 of 10 NPA samples with high viral load above 106 copies/ml, were collected from children with RTI. Hence, a positive HAdV culture result and the detection of high HAdV level above 106 copies/ml s are good indicators of RTI in children, whereas a positive HAdV PCR qualitative test result alone does not indicate RTI. Indeed, we showed that nasopharyngeal samples from children with RTI consisted of two clusters: one cluster with high viral loads (Ct<30) and one cluster with low vial loads (Ct>30) whereas among the controls, nearly all had low viral loads and clustered below this threshold value. It has been reported previously that HAdV may be excreted for long time or even may increase excretion again in association with a new infection [10,20,27], and these phenomena may explain the findings of low HAdV levels in many infected as well as in many healthy children included in our study.",
