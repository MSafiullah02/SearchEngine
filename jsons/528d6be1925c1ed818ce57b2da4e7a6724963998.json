The 49 daily incidence trend has been rapidly rising in Latin America since March 2020 with the great 50 majority of the cases reported in Brazil (28320) followed by Peru (11475) as of April 15 th , 2020. 51 Although Peru implemented social distancing measures soon after the confirmation of its first case 52 on March 6 th , 2020, the daily number of new COVID-19 cases continues to increase. We assessed 53 the early COVID-19 transmission dynamics and the effect of social distancing interventions in 54 Lima, Peru. 55 56 We estimate the transmission potential of COVID-19, R, during the early phase of the outbreak, 57 from the daily series of imported and autochthonous cases by the date of symptoms onset as of 58 March 30 th , 2020. We also assessed the effect of social distancing interventions in Lima by 59 generating short-term forecasts grounded on the early transmission dynamics before interventions 60 were put in place. 61 62 Prior to the implementation of the social distancing measures in Lima, we estimated the 63 reproduction number at 2.3 (95% CI: 2.0, 2.5). Our analysis indicates that school closures and 64 other social distancing interventions have helped stem the spread of the virus, with the nearly 65 exponential growth trend shifting to an approximately linear growth trend after the national 66 emergency declaration. 67 68",

In particular, the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-84 2) has an ability to exert substantial severe disease and mortality burden especially among 85 individuals older than 60 years and those with prior health conditions including hypertension, 86 cardiovascular disease, obesity and diabetes (Adler, 2020; Team, 2020) . As of April 15 th , 2020, 87 the trajectory of the pandemic varies significantly around the world ranging from relatively 88 contained outbreaks in Thailand, Taiwan and Hong Kong to explosive epidemics characterized by 89 initial exponential growth periods in some hotspots in the United States and European countries 90 including Italy, Spain, UK, and France (Ebbs, 2020; Griffiths, 2020; Minder, 2020) . of COVID-19 cases in Peru, the government shuttered schools on March 11 th , 2020. The next day, 106 the government banned gatherings of more than 300 people and suspended all international flights 107 from Europe and Asia. On March 16 th , 2020, the government declared a national emergency and 108 closed country borders (Explorer, 2020) . Subsequently, on March 17 th , 2020 the president of Peru 109 .

The average daily number 196 of PCR tests performed in Lima was estimated at ~188 between March 4 th -March 15 th , 2020 197 whereas the number of tests performed between March 16 th -March 30 th , 2020 increased to ~617 198 tests per day.

The 16-day calibration period of the model yields an estimated 221 growth rate, r, at 0.8 ( 95%CI: 0.6, 1.1) and a scaling of growth rate parameter, p, at 0.8 (95%CI: 222 0.7,0.9). The 20-day ahead forecast suggests that the effect of the school closure and the national 223 emergency declaration slowed down the spread of the virus as shown in Figure 4.

In contrast, a recent study on Singapore's COVID-235 19 transmission reported a lower estimate of R at ~0.7, which has been explained as a result of the 236 implementation of a sweeping social distancing interventions.237 238 The initial scaling of growth parameter in Lima indicates a nearly exponential growth pattern, 239 consistent with the early spread of the COVID-19 epidemic in Iran and the exponential growth 240 pattern of COVID-19 displayed by the Chinese province of Hubei (Muniz-Rodriguez et al., 2020; 241 Roosa et al., 2020). In comparison sub-exponential growth patterns of COVID-19 have been 242 observed in Singapore (p~0.7), Korea (p~0.76) and other Chinese provinces excluding Hubei 243 (p~0.67) as described in recent studies (Roosa et al., 2020; Shim et al., 2020; Tariq et al., 2020). 244 245 Although Lima has been quick to take aggressive measures against COVID-19, Peru remains one 246 of the hardest hit countries in Latin America (Tegel, 2020). Despite the closure of country borders 247 on March 16 th , 2020 imported cases in Lima have increased with an average of ~6 imported cases 248 reported between March 16 th -March 30 th , 2020 in comparison to an average of ~4 imported cases 249 reported per day before March 16 th , 2020. As of April 2 nd , 2020, Peru has adopted the gender-250 based quarantine measures for a week, where men and women were assigned particular days of 251 the week to leave the house to buy groceries and medicine, in an attempt to further slow the spread 252 of COVID-19 in the region (Westcott et al., 2020). The 20-day ahead forecast of our GGM model 253 calibrated to 16 days suggest that the social distancing measures, including closure of schools and 254 the declaration of national emergency are helping slow down the virus spread in Lima. Moreover, 255 the scaling of growth parameter, p was estimated at ~0.5 (95%CI: 0.5,0.6) after the implementation 256 of social distancing measures, consistent with a linear incidence growth trend. However, the 257 COVID-19 case incidence continues to accumulate despite the quarantine and lockdowns in the 258 region highlighting the need to enhance social distancing measures to further contain the outbreak. 259 260 The average positivity rate of COVID-19 in Lima was ~8.6% between March 4 th -March 30 th , 2020. 261 This positivity rate for Lima, Peru, corresponds to the positivity rates derived from Denmark, 262",

Our study underscores the need for active contact tracing efforts, isolation and 270 strict social distancing measures to contain the outbreak and mitigate active disease study we estimate the early transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 in Lima, Peru. Our 275 current findings point to sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the early phase of the outbreak, 276 with our estimate of the mean reproduction number ~2.3. The COVID-19 epidemic in Lima 277 followed an early exponential growth trend, which slowed down and turned into an almost linear 278 growth trend (p~0.5) after broad scale social distancing interventions were put in place by the 279 government. While the interventions have slowed the virus spread, the number of new COVID-19 280cases continue to accumulate, highlighting the need to continue social distancing and active case 281 finding efforts to mitigate disease transmission in the region. .C. is partially supported from NSF grants 1610429 and 1633381 and R01 GM 130900. 293 ., C.V. and G.C. analyzed the data.
