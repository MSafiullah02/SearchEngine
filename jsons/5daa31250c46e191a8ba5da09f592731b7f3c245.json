Clinical Manifestations. Patients in the ICU, especially those who are intubated or sedated, will not manifest the usual symptoms of pneumonia such as cough, chest pain, or dyspnea. Patients who are neutropenic cannot mount an inflammatory response, and, therefore, the sputum will not show purulent material. Subtle changes in oxygenation, fever, and clinical deterioration are clues for the diagnosis of pneumonia in intubated patients. Leukocytosis or leukopenia can be the first manifestation of occult pneumonia. In some instances, i.e., Pneumocystis pneumonia, the presence of spontaneous pneumothorax can be the first indication of pulmonary involvement. Thick, foul-smelling sputum is characteristic of anaerobic and aspiration pneumonia. Duration of therapy is not well defined, but most authors agree on treating gram-negative and anaerobic pneumonia for 10-21 days. Gram-positive processes are usually treated between 10 and 14 days, and atypical pneumonias receive 2 weeks of antimicrobial therapy. Candida pneumonia requires prolonged treatment with up to 1.5 g of amphotericin B as a total dose.

More than 750,000 cases of sepsis, with an associated mortality of 20-60 %, are estimated to occur annually. Despite improvements in antimicrobial therapy and supportive care, the incidence of and mortality associated with sepsis have not declined. This is, in part, a consequence of an array of medical advances that can place patients at increased risk for development of infection and, potentially, sepsis. E. Prognosis. Mortality in sepsis is a function of the severity of physiologic derangements, the duration of illness, and the number of organ system failures. These organ systems include, but are not limited to, the lungs, kidneys, and liver. When the pulmonary system becomes dysfunctional, the resultant clinical entity is known as the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
