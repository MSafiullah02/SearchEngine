The unfolded protein response (UPR), a complex adaptive stress response, attempts to restore normal proteostasis, in part, through the up-regulation of various foldases and chaperone proteins including redox-active protein disulphide isomerases (PDIs). There are currently over 20 members of the PDI family each consisting of varying numbers of thioredoxin-like domains which, generally, assist in oxidative folding and disulphide bond rearrangement of peptides. While there is a large amount of redundancy in client proteins of the various PDIs, the size of the family would indicate more nuanced roles for the individual PDIs. However, the role of individual PDIs in disease pathogenesis remains uncertain. The following review briefly discusses recent findings of ER stress, the UPR and the role of individual PDIs in various respiratory disease states.",

Additionally, numerous posttranslational modifications such as N-inked glycosylation occur solely within the ER (2) . Approximately one-third of all proteins that traffic through the ER contain disulphide bonds and the ER contains a vast array of chaperones and foldases to assist in the folding of newly synthesized peptides (1, 3) .

IRE1 exists in two isoforms a and b, this review focuses on solely IRE1 a, as the role the b isoform in activation of the UPR and induction of PDIs during pulmonary disease is less well characterized. These three pathways work in concert to decrease the protein load of the ER while simultaneously increasing its folding capacity.

Each of these transducers are integral membrane proteins residing in the ER membrane. Under normal conditions are held in inactive conformations by GRP78, an ER resident chaperone. Under conditions of ER stress unfolded or misfolded protein builds up within the ER lumen, GRP78 dissociates from the sensors owing to higher affinity to exposed hydrophobic residues on the unfolded proteins (11) . While GRP78 is considered a master regulator of the UPR, the ER chaperone HSP47 has recently been shown as a selective regulator of the IRE1 arm of the UPR, displacing GRP78 and facilitating IRE1 oligomerization (13) . Additionally, there is evidence that the individual transducers can bind unfolded protein directly (14) . GRP78 dissociates from the three ER stress sensors IRE1, ATF6 and PERK. Dimerization of IRE1 leads to autophosphorylation activating ribonuclease activity specific to XBP1 mRNA. This splicing generates XBP1s which is transported to the nuclease and induces the expression of UPR target genes. IRE1 phosphorylation also activates TRAF2 which directs the cell towards apoptosis through JNK signalling. IRE1 is also capable of associating into higher order structures which allow for non-specific degradation of ER associated mRNAs (RIDD). PERK dimerization leads to autophosphorylation activating kinase activity specific to eIF2a, halting protein translation. This loss of translation drives expression of ATF4 which acts as a transcription factor and induces the expression of UPR target genes. eIF2a is regenerated by GADD34. Upon dissociation of GRP78 from ATF6, ATF6 is transported to the Golgi where it is cleaved by cellular proteases to produce a transcription factor which induces the expression of UPR target genes.",

Notably, this XBP1 activation did not induce expression of canonical ER stress genes but was required for the continued production of proinflammatory cytokines (23) . Similarly, it has been reported dendritic cells constitutively activate the IRE1 arm of the UPR in the absence of ER stress, and this activation was required for homoeostasis of CD8a \u00fe dendritic cells (24, 25) . Additionally, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species have been shown to exacerbate TLR induced activation of the UPR (26) .

Currently, there are over 20 members of the PDI family, each differentiated from one another by the number and organization of TRX domains (29, 30) . Individual TRX domains are classified as catalytically active (a) or protein binding (b) by the presence or absence of a largely conserved CXXC sequence ( Table I) . The CXXC motif allows for the oxidoreductase activity of PDIs by alternating between an oxidized form, where both cysteines are linked through a disulphide bond, and a reduced form containing two free sulphydryl groups. This effectively transfers a disulphide to the client protein. While the individual catalytic sequences vary the overall mechanism remains the same, with the intervening residues modulating the pKa of the reactive residues. The N terminal Cys exists as a thiolate (-S \u00c0 ) anion due to its lower pKa, which mediates nucleophilic attack forming a mixed disulphide. The C terminal Cys is partially buried within the protein elevating its pKa relative to other thiols and preventing the reverse reaction from occurring. The pKa of this C terminal Cys is rapidly decreased by a conformational change in the protein itself, which brings the side chain of a highly conserved arginine in close proximity to the active site. This shift in pKa changes the C terminal Cys from a thiol to a thiolate anion, which acts to resolve the mixed disulphide through a subsequent nucleophilic attack. Additionally, salt bridges located beneath the active site also serve to modulate the pKa of the Cys residues. PDIs in the reduced dithiol state participate in isomerization reactions, shuffling disulphide bonds between Cys residues, whereas oxidized (-S-S-) PDIs introduce disulphide bonds into associated peptides. The introduction of a disulphide bond into the client protein leaves the oxidized PDI in the reduced state where it can be rapidly re-oxidized by an intricate network of enzymes (Fig. 2) . The isomerization of disulphide bonds does not involve a net change in disulphides, so the enzyme remains in the reduced state following the reaction. The above process is extensively reviewed in the following references (31, 32) .",

We have identified that various PDIs are up-regulated in allergic asthma (39, 45) , and their increases correlated with the higher bronchodilator response or blood eosinophilic counts in allergic asthmatics (39, 45) . Intriguingly our in-depth analysis of lung epithelial-specific knockouts of PDIA3 demonstrated that PDIA3 specifically regulate, eosinophilic and pro-fibrotic responses in lung epithelial cells by oxidizing cysteine sulphydryl (-SH) groups in eotaxin, periostin and epidermal growth factor (EGF) (45) . Furthermore, we also demonstrated that PDIA3 facilitates -S-S-mediated oligomerization of pro-apoptotic BAK to induce intrinsic apoptosis in allergic airway disease models (45, 46) . Ablation of Pdia3 specifically in lung epithelial cells attenuated, apoptotic, inflammatory and fibrotic responses in a model of allergic airway disease (45) . These and other literature have led to the hypothesis that heterogeneous severe asthma could potentially be classified as an endotype of asthma (47) . Although, there is very little known about the impact of PDIs in pulmonary fibrosis recent literature has highlighted that PDIs potentially regulate disulphide bonds in many pro-apoptotic and pro-fibrotic proteins including collagen crosslinking enzyme lysyl oxidase like 2 (LOXL2) (45, 46, 48) . Literature has also indicated that PDIA3 drives the trans-differentiation of murine alveolar epithelial cells and it is regulated by pro-fibrotic injury in mice (49) . We have also identified that PDIA3 as a regulator of -S-S-bonds in death receptor CD95 (FAS) and inhibition or down-regulation of PDIA3 decreases -S-S-bonds in FAS, lung epithelial apoptosis and ultimately attenuation of pulmonary fibrosis in murine models of pulmonary fibrosis (46) .",

(21) demonstrated in isolated primary human tracheobronchial epithelial (HTBE) cells that IAV infection activated the IRE1 branch of the UPR but not the PERK or ATF6 branches. That same year Roberson et al. (22) showed in isolated primary mouse tracheal epithelial cells IAV infection strongly activated the ATF6 branch, but not PERK or IRE1. As indicated the models for these two studies are different which may account for the differences in UPR activation. However, one less explored difference between the two studies is the time post-viral infection in which the activation status of the UPR was explored. Hassan et al. were able to act as surrogate chaperones for various proteins, efficient HA disulphide bond formation required PDIA3. Loss of IAV replication in cells treated with siRNA against PDIA3 supported this finding, though direct results on viral proteins were not examined (22) . More recently expanded siRNA screens identified PDIA1 and four in addition to PDIA3 as having a role in IAV replication (56) . The authors found substantial decreases in both IAV NP and M1 protein levels as well as significant decreases in viral transcript levels following siRNA treatment. Both M1 and NP lack disulphide bonds as part of their functional conformations (57) , thus it is unclear whether the examined PDIs are interacting directly with the NP or M1.",

PDIs are being found to play increasingly important roles in a wide variety of conditions and cellular activities, though current techniques to elucidate their exact role remain limited. Conventional RNA interference techniques take time to ensure sufficient knockdown of a target gene and targeting multiple genes simultaneously can pose additional problems. Employing targeted inhibitors allows for rapid decreases in protein activity and could theoretically be titrated to achieve a desired activity level. We have already demonstrated the efficacy of these inhibitors by utilizing them to determine the role of PDIs in oxidative folding of influenza proteins (39), while Cole et al. (92) explored the specific role of the PDIA1 A site on protein folding and secretion. Current compounds are able to target some of the PDI family, though inhibitory action against all PDIs has yet to be explored, and highly specific inhibitors towards PDIs other than PDIA1 remain to be developed. Nonetheless, the development of increasingly specific inhibitors specifically targeted towards individual PDIs would provide an invaluable tool to determine the distinct role of unique PDIs during disease pathogenesis.",

This distinction may help explain the contradictory results as the two studies are examining the UPR at different points of the viral replication cycle where reproductive needs and thus utilization of host proteins may be quite different. A recent third study by Landeras-Bueno et al. (55) using chemical genomics showed IAV infection leads to the attenuation of the PERK branch of the UPR in A549 cells. Interestingly, in contrast to the previous studies, they showed no downregulation of IRE1 or ATF6. Again, this may be due to differences in the time points examined. The relationship between IAV and PDIs is more straightforward, in 2006, Solda et al. (38) clearly demonstrated PDIA3 was required for efficient folding of IAV HA in vitro. They also showed while other PDIs Functions of PDIs in oxidative folding. (A) Oxidized PDIs catalyse disulphide bond formation of nascent peptides in the ER. Leading to proper oxidative folding or non-native disulphide bond formation. Reduced PDIs facilitate isomerization of disulphide bonds. (B) PDIs are oxidized via interactions with ERO1. ERO1 uses FAD to transfer electrons to molecular oxygen generating hydrogen peroxide. PRX4can also directly oxidize PDIs. PDIs transfer disulphides to client proteins. Glutathione contributes to disulphide bond reduction.",
