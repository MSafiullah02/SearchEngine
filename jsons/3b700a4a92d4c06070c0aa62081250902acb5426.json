Respiratory viral infections are usually preceding or coinciding with acute otitis media (AOM) in children. It is not known if a given viral infection would facilitate invasion of bacterial pathogens into the middle ear in a species-specific way. We reanalysed the microbiological results of the two prospective Finnish Otitis Media (FinOM) studies for this purpose. Methods. The children had been followed from 2 months to 2 years of age in specific study clinics and all referred AOM events were analysed. Combined results of virus detection tests from middle ear fluid and nasopharyngeal aspirate and those of bacterial culture from middle ear fluid were cross-tabulated for 529 AOM events in the FinOM Cohort Study and for 364 events in the FinOM Vaccine Trial. Results. In both studies the main bacterial pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis while the main viruses detected were rhinoviruses and respiratory syncytial virus (plus enteroviruses in the Vaccine Trial). No distinct species-specific associations were observed between the viral and bacterial findings. Conclusion. We did not find support to the theory that respiratory infection caused by a given viral species would favour growth of a certain bacterial pathogen in the MEF more than another.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Is there any specific association between respiratory viruses and bacteria in acute otitis media of young children?", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "with acute otitis media, as reported e.g. by Kilpi et al. 1 while the previously important Streptococcus pyogenes has become less common. Viral upper respiratory infections (URI), usually preceding the clinical ear symptoms by a few days, 2,3 are increasingly acknowledged as important factors in the development of AOM in children, either together with bacterial pathogens or on their own. 4-7 Support for a synergistic effect of distinct viruses and bacteria in the pathogenesis of AOM has been obtained in an experimental animal model in chinchilla 8, 9 while the matter has been examined in only a few human studies. Chonmaintree and coworkers found no association between specific bacterial and viral findings in 84 AOM events, 10 whereas Heikkinen and co-workers reported, from another small study, that S. pneumoniae bacteria were cultured from influenza virus containing MEF specimens more frequently than from those containing other viruses. 11 Apart from spreading to the middle ear itself, a virus infection in the nasopharynx may contribute to the pathogenesis of AOM by causing inflammation of the mucosa, blocking the Eustachian tube and impairing the host's immune functions [12] [13] [14] thus aiding in the invasion by bacteria. Infections caused by respiratory syncytial virus especially have been suggested to result in AOM more often than those by other viruses. 11 Other viruses or virus groups often associated with AOM include influenza virus A, adenoviruses and parainfluenza virus types 1 and 3.

Both studies had involved large groups of children visiting special study clinics, with all AOM events clinically well characterised and the microbiological aetiology thoroughly examined. In a large proportion of the studied events in both studies, a verified viral infection was coinciding with a positive MEF culture for one of the major bacteriological pathogens, but no species-specific associations were seen. This is in agreement with a previous report by Chonmaitree and co-workers. 10 Viral respiratory infections are commonly known to accompany or precede acute otitis media and the significance of viral-bacterial interactions in the development of clinical AOM is generally accepted. Different pathogenetic mechanisms for these interactions have been suggested and they supposedly act together in a complicated manner depending on the immune status and genetic background of the host in addition to the properties of the microbes involved. We hypothesized that a given virus group or species might facilitate growth of a certain bacterial species in the middle ear, for instance, by inducing a cytokine response causing a specific pattern of inflammation in the nasopharynx, which would then favour one bacterial species more than another. This situation could be presented as a specific association between the indicated virus group and the benefited bacterial species. Our failure to detect any such association should not be taken as evidence for that such a situation could not exist, because several features in our set up might have prevented us from seeing it. Firstly, our microbiological data were limited to a single sampling time determined by the child's presentation at the study clinic after a varying length of AOM symptoms, while the associated viral infection had persisted most likely for several days already. As a consequence, we may have missed some relevant viruses. Secondly, for a bacterial species to be detected in the MEF during AOM, it is required that the patient is carrying the bacterium in the nasopharynx before the onset of AOM. No relevant bacterial carriage data were available for these patients but it is obvious that every child was not carrying every bacterial pathogen constantly. This might be one reason for the observed variation in the distribution of the bacterial species in different datasets representing a single study. For instance, the sample of AOM events of the Vaccine Trial analysed in this study showed relatively more S. pneumoniae than larger materials of the same study analysed before. 18, 19 Thirdly, in spite of using sensitive techniques to detect the different viruses in the samples, both biological and technical factors may have resulted in missing some infections caused by the virus groups tested for. The quantities and the lengths of excretion are likely to vary depending on both the virus species and the host individual. Likewise, the detection sensitivities of the tests-even if exploiting the same principle-usually vary from virus to virus.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2871, "end": 2874, "text": "18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Two groups of known respiratory viral pathogens were not tested for at all, human coronaviruses and human metapneumovirus. Testing for them might have increased the proportion of AOM events with documented coninciding defined virus infection, but we do not believe that it would have changed the main results of this study because the tested viruses covered two thirds of all AOM events, with or without MEF cultures positive for bacterial pathogens. Under these conditions, it is obvious that only very strong interactions would become apparent and our negative results for specific virusbacterial associations in AOM should be valued accordingly.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The distribution of the specific viruses in the cross-tabulations seemed mostly quite haphazard, and apparent trends in one of the studies were not usually confirmed in the other. Only the occurrences of rhinoviruses, enteroviruses and RSV were analysed because the numbers of all other detected viruses were so small that random effects caused confusing, and most likely false segregations. This is exemplified in Table 4 where in the Cohort Study, pneumococci appear to associate with virus mixture much more often than with any single virus, whereas in the Vaccine Trial the opposite is true and here instead M. catarrhalis is specifically associated with virus mixture. Epidemiological studies indicate that occurrence of AOM is strictly associated with viral upper respiratory tract infections. In the prospective Cohort Study, about 40% of URI in young children were found to result in AOM. 5 In this study, we decided to compare the aetiology of URI, whether based on virus detection in NPA or MEF, with the bacterial MEF culture result, rather than relying on the MEF results only for both microbial classes. In these two studies, the overall rate of virus detection in the MEF was about two thirds of that in the NPA and the virus found in the MEF was also detected in the NPA specimen in about 60 and 80%, respectively, of the MEF positive events. 6 We also made the crosstabulations of the MEF results only (not shown) and found that, possibly due to smaller numbers of events, random variation appeared to cause some trends in one study but again, they were not seen in the other, and, therefore, not likely to be true.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 415, "end": 422, "text": "Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "RSV was detected in AOM slightly more often without bacteria than concomitantly with them. This trend is consistent with the previous concept 11 that, as compared with other viral infections, RSV infection is associated with an increased risk for AOM, even without bacteria. Similarly, RSV positive URI episodes were more often associated with AOM than URI due to other viruses 5 and, compared with other viruses, a relatively larger proportion of RSV positive NPA specimens was coinciding with RSV positive MEF specimens. 6 Enteroviruses, analysed in the Vaccine Trial only, appeared to occur more often with the main bacterial pathogens than without them. This might mean that enteroviruses are not very potential pathogens in the ear by themselves.
