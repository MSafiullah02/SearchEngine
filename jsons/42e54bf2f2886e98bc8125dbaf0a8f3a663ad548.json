He later showed that genes occupy specific locations on the chromosome. With this knowledge, Morgan and his students began the first chromosomal map of the fruit fly Drosophila. In 1928, Frederick Due to the chemical composition of the pentose residues of the bases, DNA strands have directionality. One end of a DNA strand contains an exposed hydroxyl group on the deoxyribose; this is known as the 3' end of the molecule. The other end contains an exposed phosphate group; this is the 5' end. The directionality of DNA is vitally important to many cellular processes, since double helices are necessarily directional (a strand running 5'-3' pairs with a complementary strand running 3'-5'), and processes such as DNA replication occur in only one direction. All nucleic acid synthesis in a cell occurs in the 5'-3' direction, because new monomers are added via a dehydration reaction that uses the exposed 3' hydroxyl as a nucleophile.",

Because they use RNA to store genetic information, their cellular hosts may synthesize their proteins as soon as they are infected and without the delay in waiting for transcription. On the other hand, RNA retroviruses, such as HIV, require reverse transcription of their genome from RNA into DNA before their proteins can be synthesized. In 2006, French researchers came across a puzzling example of RNA-mediated inheritance in the mouse. Mice with a loss-of-function mutation in the gene Kit have white tails. Offspring of these mutants can have white tails despite having only normal Kit genes. The research team traced this effect back to mutated Kit RNA [11] .

A gene can have more than one promoter, resulting in RNAs that differ in how far they extend from the promoter [12] . Although promoter regions have a consensus sequence that is the most common sequence at this position, some genes have \"strong\" promoters that bind the transcription machinery well, and others have \"weak\" promoters that bind poorly. These weak promoters usually permit a lower rate of transcription than the strong promoters, because the transcription machinery binds to them and initiates transcription less frequently. Other possible regulatory regions include enhancers, which can compensate for a weak promoter. Most regulatory regions are \"upstream\"-that is, before or toward the 5' end of the transcription initiation site. Eukaryotic promoter regions are much more complex and difficult to identify than prokaryotic promoters.",

The region of the chromosome at which a particular gene is located is called its locus. A chromosome consists of a single, very long DNA helix on which thousands of genes are encoded. Prokaryotes-bacteria and archaea-typically store their genomes on a single large, circular chromosome, which is sometimes supplemented by additional small circles of DNA called plasmids. These usually encode only a few genes and are easily transferable between individuals. For example, the genes for antibiotic resistance are usually encoded on bacterial plasmids and can be passed between individual cells, even those of different species via horizontal gene transfer. Although some simple eukaryotes also possess plasmids with a small number of genes, the majority of eukaryotic genes are stored on multiple linear chromosomes, which are packed within the nucleus in a complex with storage proteins called histones. The manner in which DNA is stored on the histone, as well as the chemical modifications of the histone itself, are regulatory mechanisms governing whether or not a particular region of DNA is accessible for transcription. The ends of eukaryotic chromosomes are capped by long stretches of repetitive sequences called telomeres, which do not code for any gene product but are present to prevent degradation of coding and regulatory regions during DNA replication. The length of the telomeres tends to decrease each time the genome is replicated in preparation for cell division; the loss of telomeres has been proposed as an explanation for cellular senescence, or the loss of the ability to divide [13] .",

Expression vectors are a specialized type of cloning vector which includes the transcriptional and translational signals needed for the regulation of the gene of interest. The transcriptional and translational signals may be synthetically created to make the expression of the gene of interest easier to regulate. Usually the ultimate aim of expression cloning is to produce large quantities of specific proteins. To this end, a bacterial expression clone may include a ribosome binding site (Shine-Dalgarno sequence) to enhance translation of messager RNA (mRNA) of the interested gene, a transcription termination sequence, or in eukaryotes, specific sequences to promote the post-translational modification of the protein product.",

The vast majority of PCR methods use thermal cycling, i.e., alternately heating and cooling the PCR sample to a defined series of temperature steps. These thermal cycling steps are necessary to physically separate the strands (at high temperatures) in a DNA double helix (DNA melting) used as the template during DNA synthesis (at lower temperatures) by the DNA polymerase to selectively amplify the target DNA. The selectivity of PCR results from the use of primers that are complementary to the DNA region targeted for amplification under specific thermal cycling conditions.

These include DNA cloning for sequencing, DNA-based phylogeny, or functional analysis of genes; the diagnosis of hereditary diseases; the identification of genetic fingerprints (used in forensic sciences and paternity testing); and the detection and diagnosis of infectious diseases.

Arrays make it possible to put down a large quantity of very small (100 mm diameter) spots on a single slide. Each spot has a DNA fragment molecule that is complementary to a single DNA sequence (similar to southern blotting). A variation of this technique allows the gene expression of an organism at a particular stage in development to be quantified (expression profiling). In this technique, the RNA in a tissue is isolated and converted to labeled cDNA. This cDNA is then hybridized to the fragments on the array and visualization of the hybridization can be done. Since multiple arrays can be made with the exact same position of fragments, they are particularly useful for comparing the gene expression of two different tissues, such as a healthy and cancerous tissue. Also, one can measure what genes are expressed and how that expression changes with time or with other factors. For instance, the common baker's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, contains about 7,000 genes; with a microarray, one can measure qualitatively how each gene is expressed, and how that expression changes, for example, with a change in temperature [24] . There are many different ways to fabricate microarrays; the most common are silicon chips, microscope slides with spots of -100 mm diameter, custom arrays, and arrays with larger spots on porous membranes (macroarrays). There can be anywhere from 100 spots to more than 10,000 on a given array [25] . Arrays can also be made with molecules other than DNA.

The eukaryotic cell contains a nucleus, shown as Fig. 16 .2. Eukaryotes are the organisms made up of eukaryotic cells. They include protista, fungi, animals and plants. Prokaryotes include archaebacteria and eubacteria. They are single-cell organisms. More recently, \"archaebacteria\" have been placed in a category outside \"bacteria,\" because they are quite different from ordinary bacteria. According to the new classification, prokaryotes are divided into archaea and bacteria, where \"archaea\" is equivalent to \"archaebacteria,\" and \"bacteria\" is the same as \"eubacteria.\" Archaea live in extreme environments. They may be organized into three groups: Methanogens which live in anaerobic environment such as swamps. They produce methane and cannot tolerate exposure to oxygen. Extreme halophiles live in very high concentrations of salt (NaCl), e.g., the Dead Sea and the Great Salt Lake. Extreme thermophiles [27] live in hot, sulfur-rich and low pH environments, such as hot springs, geysers and fumaroles as seen in the Yellowstone National Park. All cells contain a cytoplasm, plasma membrane, and DNA. Cytoplasm is the viscous contents of a cell, including proteins, ribosomes, metabolites and ions. Ribosomes are the sites of protein synthesis. The plasma membrane is the cell membrane surrounding the cytoplasm, shown as Fig. 16 .3. It consists of a phospholipid bilayer, associated proteins and carbohydrates. The phospholipid bilayer is also the basic constituent of other biomembranes. DNA is the genetic material. A eukaryotic cell contains several DNA molecules located in the nucleus and mitochondria which are membrane-bound organelles. A prokaryotic cell contains a single DNA molecule, which has no specific boundary with the cytoplasm. The cell nucleus consists of a nuclear envelope, nucleolus and nucleoplasm. Most chromosomes are located in the nucleoplasm, but portions of several chromosomes containing clusters of rRNA genes may get together in the nucleolus, forming the nucleolar organizing region. The major role of the nucleolus is to produce rRNA. Chromosomes are the structures that hold DNA molecules. One chromosome contains a DNA molecule. Each chromosome has a p and q arm; p is the shorter arm and q is the longer arm. The arms are separated by a pinched region called the centromere. In order for chromosomes to be seen with a microscope, they need to be stained. Once stained, the chromosomes look like strings with light and dark \"bands\" and their picture can be taken. The picture, or chromosome map, is called a karyotype. The germ cell (sperm or egg) of a human being contains 23 chromosomes, labeled from 1 to 22 and is either X or Y. The somatic cell (cells other than germ cells) of a normal person has 46 chromosomes. For other species, the chromosome number varies from 1 to 1,260. A human somatic cell contains two chromosomes that determine the sex of a person. The two sex chromosomes are XY in males and XX in females. The gene (SRY) that is important for testes formation is located on the Y chromosome. It is possible that a person with testes still exhibits female characteristics [28] [29] [30] [31] .",

It was previously believed that the RNA polymerase holoenzyme initiates transcription, while the core RNA polymerase alone synthesizes RNA. Thus, the accepted view was that the sigma factor must dissociate upon transition from transcription initiation to transcription elongation (this transition is called \"promoter escape\"). This view was based on analysis of purified complexes of RNA polymerase stalled at initiation and at elongation. Finally, structural models of RNA polymerase complexes predict that as the growing RNA product becomes longer than ~10 nucleotides, sigma must be \"pushed out\" of the holoenzyme since there is a steric clash between RNA and a sigma domain. However, a recent study [36] has shown that \u03c3 70 remains attached to the complex with the core RNA polymerase, at least during early elongation. Indeed, the phenomenon of promoter-proximal stalling suggests that sigma may play a role during early elongation. All studies are consistent with the assumption that promoter escape reduces the lifetime of the sigma-core interaction at initiation (too long to be measured in a typical biochemical experiment) to a shorter, measurable lifetime upon transition to elongation.",

The eukaryotic Initiation Factor 3 (eIF3) is associated with the small ribosomal subunit, and plays a role in keeping the large ribosomal subunit from prematurely binding. eIF3 also interacts with the eIF4F complex which consists of three other initiation factors: eIF4A, eIF4E and eIF4G. eIF4G is a scaffolding protein which directly associates with both eIF3 and the other two components. eIF4E is the cap-binding protein.

            "text": "Elongation is dependent on eukaryotic elongation factors [40] . At the end of the initiation step, the mRNA is positioned so that the next codon can be translated during the elongation stage of protein synthesis. The initiator tRNA occupies the P site in the ribosome, and the A site is ready to receive an aminoacyl-tRNA. During chain elongation, each additional amino acid is added to the nascent polypeptide chain in a three-step microcycle. The steps in this microcycle are (1) positioning the correct aminoacyl-tRNA in the A site of the ribosome, (2) forming the peptide bond and (3) shifting the mRNA by one codon relative to the ribosome. The translation machinery works relatively slowly compared to the enzyme systems that catalyze DNA replication. Proteins in procaryotes are synthesized at a rate of only 18 amino acid residues per second, whereas bacterial replisomes synthesize DNA at a rate of 1,000 nucleotides per second. This difference in rate reflects, in part, the difference between polymerizing four types of nucleotides to make nucleic acids and polymerizing 20 types of amino acids to make proteins. Testing and rejecting incorrect aminoacyl-tRNA molecules takes time and slows protein synthesis. The rate of transcription in prokaryotes is approximately 55 nucleotides per second, which corresponds to about 18 codons per second, or the same rate at which the mRNA is translated. In bacteria, translation initiation occurs as soon as the 5' end of an mRNA is synthesized, and translation and transcription are coupled. This tight coupling is not possible in eukaryotes because transcription and translation are carried out in separate compartments of the cell (the nucleus and cytoplasm). Eukaryotic mRNA precursors must be processeed in the nucleus (e.g. capping, polyadenylation, and splicing) before they are exported to the cytoplasm for translation. Eukaryotic elongation factors are very similar to those in prokaryotes. Elongation in eukaryotes is carried out with two elongation factors: eEF-1 and eEF-2. The first is eEF-1, whose \u03b1 and \u03b2\u03b3 subunits act as counterparts to EF-Tu and EF-Ts respectively. The second is eEF-2, the counterpart to prokaryotic EF-G [43] Termination of elongation is dependent on eukaryotic release factors. The process is similar to that of prokaryotic termination.",

Histone proteins, the foundation blocks of chromatin, are modified by various post-translational modification to alter DNA packing. Acetylation results in the loosening of chromatin and lends itself to replication and transcription. When methylated, they hold DNA together strongly and restrict access to various enzymes. A recent study showed that there is a bivalent structure present in the chromatin: methylated lysine residues at location 4 and 27 on histone 3. It is believed that this may be involved in development; there is more methylation of lysine 27 in embryonic cells than in differentiated cells, whereas lysine 4 methylation positively regulates transcription by recruiting nucleosome remodeling enzymes and histone acetylases [57] . Polycomb-group proteins play a role in regulating genes through modulation of chromatin structure [58] .",

The nucleosomes bind DNA non-specifically, as required by their function in general DNA packaging. There is, however, some preference in the sequences the nucleosomes will bind.

Both steps involve trans-esterification reactions that occur between RNA nucleotides. tRNA splicing, however, is an exception and does not occur by trans-esterification. Spliceosomal and self-splicing trans-esterification reactions occur via two sequential trans-esterification reactions. First, the 2' OH of a specific branch-point nucleotide within the intron is defined during spliceosome assembly and performs a nucleophilic attack on the first nucleotide of the intron at the 5' splice site forming the lariat intermediate. Second, the 3' OH of the released 5' exon then performs a nucleophilic attack on the last nucleotide of the intron at the 3' splice site thus joining the exons and releasing the intron lariat.",

The diphosphate 5' prime end then attacks the \u03b1 phosphorus atom of a GTP molecule in order to add the guanine residue in a 5'5' triphosphate link. The enzyme S-adenosyl methionine then methylates the guanine ring at the N-7 position. This type of cap, with just the (m7G) in position is called a cap 0 structure. The ribose of the adjacent nucleotide may also be methylated to give a cap 1. Methylation of nucleotides downstream of the RNA molecule produce cap 2, cap 3 structures and so on. In these cases, the methyl groups are added to the 2' OH groups of the ribose sugar. The cap protects the 5' end of the primary RNA transcript from attack by ribonucleases that have a specificity to the 3'5' phosphodiester bonds [75] .",

The cleavage and adenylation reactions occur if a polyadenylation signal sequence (5'-AAUAAA-3') is located near the 3' end of the pre-mRNA molecule, which is followed by another sequence, which is usually (5'-CA-3'). The second signal is the site of cleavage. A GU-rich sequence is also usually present further downstream on the pre-mRNA molecule. After the synthesis of the sequence elements, two multi-subunit proteins called cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) and cleavage stimulation factor (CStF) are transferred from RNA Polymerase II to the RNA molecule. The two factors bind to the sequence elements. A protein complex form contains additional cleavage factors and the enzyme Polyadenylate Polymerase (PAP). This complex cleaves the RNA between the polyadenylation sequence and the GU-rich sequence at the cleavage site marked by the (5'-CA-3') sequences. Poly(A) polymerase then adds about 200 adenine units to the new 3' end of the RNA molecule using ATP as a precursor. As the poly(A) tails is synthesized, it binds multiple copies of the poly(A) binding protein, which protects the 3' end from ribonuclease digestion [75] . RNA splicing is the process by which introns, regions of RNA that do not code for protein, are removed from the pre-mRNA and the remaining exons connect to re-form a single continuous molecule. Although most RNA splicing occurs after the complete synthesis and end-capping of the pre-mRNA, transcripts with many exons can be spliced co-transcriptionally [76] . The splicing reaction is catalyzed by a large protein complex called the spliceosome, which is assembled from proteins and small nuclear RNA molecules that recognize splice sites in the pre-mRNA sequence. Many pre-mRNAs, including those encoding antibodies, can be spliced in multiple ways to produce different mature mRNAs that encode different protein sequences. This process is known as alternative splicing, and allows production of a large variety of proteins from a limited amount of DNA.",

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is located inside mitochondria organelles, exists in multiple copies, and is also tightly associated with a number of proteins to form a complex known as the nucleoid. Inside mitochondria, reactive oxygen species (ROS) or free radicals, byproducts of the constant production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) via oxidative phosphorylation, create a highly oxidative environment that is known to damage mtDNA.

The formation of thymine dimers (a common type of cyclobutyl dimer) upon irradiation with UV light results in an abnormal covalent bond between adjacent thymidine bases.

It involves switching out regular DNA polymerases for specialized translesion polymerases (e.g. DNA polymerase V), often with larger active sites that can facilitate the insertion of bases opposite damaged nucleotides. The polymerase switching is thought to be mediated by, among other factors, the post-translational modification of the replication processivity factor PCNA. Translesion synthesis polymerases often have low fidelity (high propensity to insert wrong bases) relative to regular polymerases. However, many are extremely efficient at inserting correct bases opposite specific types of damage. For example, Pol \u03b7 mediates error-free bypass of lesions induced by UV irradiation, whereas Pol \u03b6 introduces mutations at these sites. From a cellular perspective, risking the introduction of point mutations during translesion synthesis may be preferable to resorting to more drastic mechanisms of DNA repair, which may cause gross chromosomal aberrations or cell death.",

It is known that LexA regulates transcription of approximately 48 genes including the lexA and recA genes [132] . The most common cellular signals activating the SOS response are regions of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), arising from stalled replication forks or double-strand breaks, which are processed by DNA helicase to separate the two DNA strands [129] . In the initiation step, RecA protein binds to ssDNA in an ATP hydrolysis driven reaction creating RecA-ssDNA filaments. RecA-ssDNA filaments activate LexA autoprotease activity which ultimately leads to cleavage of the LexA dimer and subsequent LexA degradation. The loss of LexA repressor induces transcription of the SOS genes and allows for further signal induction, inhibition of cell division and an increase in levels of proteins responsible for damage processing [133] .",

This distinction in promoter sequences causes differential binding of LexA to different promoters and allows for timing of the SOS response. Logically, the lesion repair genes are induced at the beginning of the SOS response. The error prone translesion polymerases, s, for example: UmuCD'2 (also called DNA polymerase V), are induced later as a last resort [134] . Once the DNA damage is repaired or bypassed using polymerases or through recombination, the amount of single-stranded DNA in cells is decreased, lowering the amounts of RecA filaments decreases cleavage activity of LexA homodimer which subsequently binds to the SOS boxes near promoters and restores normal gene expression. Eukaryotic cells exposed to DNA damaging agents also activate important defensive pathways by inducing multiple proteins involved in DNA repair, cell cycle checkpoint control, protein trafficking and degradation. Such genome wide transcriptional response is very complex and tightly regulated, thus allowing coordinated global response to damage. Exposure of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to DNA damaging agents results in overlapping but distinct transcriptional profiles. Similarities to environmental shock responses indicate that a general global stress response pathway exists at the level of transcriptional activation. In contrast, different human cell types respond to damage differently indicating an absence of a common global response. The probable explanation for this difference between yeast and human cells may be in the heterogeneity of mammalian cells. In an animal, different types of cells are distributed amongst different organs which have evolved different sensitivities to DNA damage [134] .",

Nucleic acids became the sole and universal means of encoding genetic information, requiring DNA repair mechanisms that in their basic form have been inherited by all extant life forms from their common ancestor. The emergence of Earth's oxygen-rich atmosphere (known as the \"oxygen catastrophe\") due to photosynthetic organisms, as well as the presence of potentially damaging free radicals in the cell due to oxidative phosphorylation, necessitated the evolution of DNA repair mechanisms that acted specifically to counter the types of damage induced by oxidative stress. On some occasions, DNA damage is not repaired, or is repaired by an error-prone mechanism, which results in a change from the original sequence. When this occurs, mutations may propagate into the genomes of the cell's progeny. Should such an event occur in a germ line cell that will eventually produce a gamete, the mutation has the potential to be passed on to the organism's offspring. The rate of evolution in a particular species (or more narrowly, in a particular gene) is a function of the rate of mutation. Consequently, the rate and accuracy of DNA repair mechanisms have an influence over the process of evolutionary change [147] .",

Ribosomes are made of small and large subunits which surround the mRNA. In translation (Fig. 16.11 ), mRNA is decoded to produce a specific polypeptide according to the rules specified by the genetic code. This uses an mRNA sequence as a template to guide the synthesis of a chain of amino acids that form a protein. Many types of transcribed RNA, such as transfer RNA, ribosomal RNA, and small nuclear RNA are not necessarily translated into an amino acid sequence.

While this is not technically a step in translation, it is required for translation to proceed. The amino acid is joined by its carboxyl group to the 3'OH of the tRNA by an ester bond. When the tRNA has an amino acid linked to it, it is termed \"charged.\" Initiation involves the small subunit of the ribosome binding to 5' end of mRNA with the help of initiation factors (IF). Termination of the polypeptide happens when the A site of the ribosome faces a stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA). When this happens, no tRNA can recognize it, but a releasing factor can recognize nonsense codons and causes the release of the polypeptide chain. The 5' end of the mRNA gives rise to the protein's N-terminal and the direction of translation can therefore be stated as N->C. The capacity of disabling or inhibiting translation in protein biosynthesis is used by antibiotics such as: anisomycin, cycloheximide, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, streptomycin, erythromycin, puromycin and others.
