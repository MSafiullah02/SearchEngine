They cause\na variety of illnesses that range from the common cold to severe respiratory illnesses [6]. The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) was the first coronavirus\nidentified to cause widespread outbreaks of critical illness. It caused a worldwide outbreak during the winter of 2002\u20132003, eventually leading to 8096\nconfirmed cases, including 774 deaths [7]. The SARS epidemic was\ncontained in 2003 [7]. SARS\u2010CoV belongs to lineage B of the betacoronavirus\n[8], whereas MERS\u2010CoV belongs to lineage C of the same genus. MERS\u2010CoV enters cells\nvia a common receptor, the dipeptidyl peptidase\u20104 (DPP4), also known as CD26, and replicates in bronchial, bronchiolar and type I\nand II alveolar epithelial cells [9, 10]. The virus has primarily been detected in respiratory secretions, with the highest viral loads\nin the lower respiratory tract [11]. In MERS\u2010CoV cases, one study showed that\napproximately 70% of patients had continued respiratory shedding for > 30 days [12]. MERS\u2010CoV infection often manifests with acute kidney injury (AKI), the pathogenesis of which\nremains unknown, although direct viral infection is a possibility since the DPP4 receptor is heavily expressed in human kidneys\n[13]. Viral shedding has also been detected in the urine and stool of infected\npatients [14].",

In a cross\u2010sectional serosurveillance study of 10,009 individuals in Saudi Arabia, positive serology was documented in\nonly 0.15% [16].

Secondary transmission within healthcare settings has been described with already\u2010hospitalized patients and healthcare\nworkers acquiring the disease [18, 19]. This has been attributed to overcrowding, movement of infected patients who did not yet have\na diagnosis and breaches of infection prevention and control practices [3]. A study\nevaluated the stability of MERS\u2010CoV under different environmental conditions and found that the virus was more stable at low\ntemperature/low humidity than at higher temperature/ higher humidity conditions [20].

Most severe cases have been reported in adults with chronic comorbidities, including diabetes\nmellitus, chronic cardiac disease, chronic lung disease, end\u2010stage kidney disease, or immunosuppression [21, 22]. However, severe infection may also occur\namong younger patients, including healthcare workers [18]. Compared with SARS\u2010CoV,\nMERS\u2010CoV affects older patients, men more than women, and people with comorbid illnesses. The healthcare\u2010associated MERS\u2010CoV\ninfections occurred within the first week of the index case illness, while for SARS they occurred mainly in the second week, likely\ndue to the different timings of peak viral load [23]. The current literature suggests\nthat children are rarely affected by MERS\u2010CoV [24].",

Diagnosis is, therefore, based on molecular testing by real\u2010time reverse\u2010transcription polymerase\nchain reaction (rRT\u2010PCR) for two sites in the virus genome: the upstream E protein (upE) for\nscreening and the open reading frame (ORF) 1a or 1b for confirmation [28]. Lower respiratory tract specimens have a\nhigher sensitivity than upper respiratory tract specimens for detecting MERS\u2010CoV [29].
