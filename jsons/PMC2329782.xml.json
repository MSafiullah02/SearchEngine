Although market animals are believed to have been the source of human transmission,17 bats are suspected to be the sylvatic reservoir of the virus. Early in the illness, SARS cannot be distinguished from common respiratory infections based on clinical symptoms.18 SARS-CoV causes high mortality; thus, timely, sensitive, and specific diagnosis is needed to prevent the spread of this contagious disease. During the SARS epidemic, PCR-based molecular testing was helpful because of its ability to rapidly screen for many viruses. After the identification of SARS-CoV, specific RT-PCR and serological assays were developed to detect infection before the appearance of antibodies when the risk of transmission is greatest.19202122 SARS-CoV was detected by RT-PCR in nasopharyngeal aspirates in 32% of patients at the initial presentation and in 68% by day 14.21 Viral RNA was also detected by RT-PCR in 97% of stool samples 14 days after disease onset. In contrast, SARS-CoV IgG seroconversions began on day 10 with detection of about 60% by day 18 and 100% by day 30 after onset. Combined RT-PCR and immunoassays diagnosed 95% and 100% of patients on day 10 using nasopharyngeal aspirate and stool samples, respectively.21",

Molecular assays have become an essential diagnostic tool for sensitive and specific detection of HCoVs. Several consensus and subtype-specific molecular assays have been developed for either all or each of the four HcoVs.27,28,30 The genetic variability of HCoVs makes the detection of all circulating strains technically challenging. For example, when panCoV primers were used, Gerna et al failed to detect approximately 30% of circulating strains.28 Thus to detect the maximal number of HCoVs, specific primers are used, and results are confirmed by a second set of primers.28 False-negative results occur when assay sensitivity is below the actual viral load in the specimen. Another potential technical issue is false identification because of cross-reactivity between HCoV strains.",

Granulomatous amebic encephalitis is more common in immunocompromised patients and occurs worldwide. Balamuthia was isolated first in 1986 from a baboon that died of granulomatous amebic encephalitis.77 Isolation is performed in mammalian cell cultures. Initial sites of infection are possibly the lower respiratory tract, respiratory sinuses, or skin with dissemination to the central nervous system.78 Diagnosis is based on histological identification in brain tissue.78 Differentiation between Acanthamoeba and Balamuthia is difficult, but specific antibodies are applied in research laboratories for immunohistochemistry.78 PCR tests target the mitochondrial 16S rRNA genes and 18S rRNA genes. The analytical sensitivity using the mitochondrial target is as low as 0.2 amoebas per reaction mixture due to the abundant targets present in each amebic cell, which contains hundreds or thousands of mitochondria. This assay has been effective in three cases using brain tissue and three cases using cerebrospinal fluid. A multiplex approach on a real-time PCR platform differentiates among the three species responsible for amebic encephalitis using TaqMan probes specific for each of the species. The test is rapid and specific with analytical sensitivity of one amebic cell per reaction mixture.79,80",
