            "text": "Bronchial asthma is not generally considered to be a disease of the elderly. Population surveys, however, show that the prevalence of asthma in the elderly ranges from 2.4% to 12.2%.18, 45, 48, 154 In a study comparing late-onset asthma and long-standing disease in nonsmoking elderly asthmatics, Braman et al19 noted that 48% of patients developed asthma after 65 years of age. In a review of 10 population studies, Enright et al45 found the prevalence of asthma to range from 2.4% to 6.6%. Banerjee et al8 noted that 61% of randomly selected geriatric day-hospital patients exhibited airflow obstruction on pulmonary function testing. Of those with airflow obstruction 41.2% demonstrated greater than 15% improvement in peak expiratory flow rate following inhalation of 200 \u03bcg of salmeterol. In addition to chronic asthma, the incidence of new cases after 60 years of age appears to remain relatively constant, ranging from two to six cases per thousand.18, 21, 22, 39 Advances in technology, nutrition, and medicine have set the stage for profound increases in the geriatric populations, such that the over-85 age group is the fastest growing segment of society in North America.28 Based on current trends, by the year 2020, the over-65 and over-75 age groups will constitute 22% and 14.2% of the populations in the industrialized nations.30 Thus we can anticipate a sustained increase in geriatric asthmatics requiring care. The principles of managing asthma in elderly patients differ little from those of treating younger patients. The impaired excretion of drugs by the kidney and liver, however, and greater likelihood of comorbid diseases and adverse drug\u2013drug interactions make the management of asthma in elderly patients complex.178, 196\n",

            "text": "Resistance to microbial invasion of the lower respiratory tract is multifactorial and complex. The respiratory tract immune system is composed of both specific and nonspecific defense mechanisms that consist of a variety of anatomic, neurologic, cellular, and humoral mechanisms. The integrity of these mechanisms, pathogen virulence and the size of the bacterial inoculum play key roles in colonization and subsequent infection of the lower respiratory tract. A variety of conditions contributing to alveolar fluid accumulation place the host at an increased risk of pneumonia. Diminishing host defenses increase the vulnerability of elderly asthmatic patients to more protracted and debilitating consequences of lung infections. Increased vulnerability may also reflect the increased prevalence of diseases associated with fluid retention, such as cardiac, renal, or liver failure, swallowing disorders, altered consciousness, deconditioning due to a sedentary lifestyle, or adverse effects of malnutrition, immunosuppression, or malignancy. Harford and Hara87 demonstrated the harmful effects of increased lung water on the survival of mice with experimental pneumonia. A 15-fold increase in mortality was described in mice inoculated with endobroncheal bacteria, following endobronchial infusion of saline or serum. Effective phagocytosis cannot occur under these conditions in the absence of opsonic antibodies.

            "text": "Yet despite their acceptance and teleologic attractiveness, these deficiencies' causal relationships to clinical infections are unclear.4, 12, 72, 77, 152, 161 Chandra30 noted that in previously healthy individuals, the presence of anergy, lymphopenia, or both was associated with 1-year survival rates of 72%, 58%, and 45%, respectively. In a 16-year longitudinal study of healthy elderly men, decreased absolute lympocyte counts were noted within 3 years of death.12 The leukopenia, however, was not age dependent and in both of these studies might have served as a marker of more severe comorbid disease(s). In predominately healthy patients with a mean age of 82 years, a normal inflammatory response to pneumonia was noted, as measured by appropriate rise in C-reactive protein, leukocytosis, and a neutrophil degranulation product, plasma neutrophil elastase \u03b1-1-antiproteinase complex.4 In addition, despite having measurably lower numbers of cytotoxic T lymphocytes at baseline, elderly patients were able to mount an adequate response following inactivated influenza A virus vaccination.152 These results support the notion that the healthy elderly are still able to mount an adequate immune response to pneumonia. Nasopharyngeal colonization with gram-negative bacteria has been reported to increase in elderly patients, but few studies have looked at the elderly living independently within the community.49, 50, 181, 185 It is likely that the high rates of colonization are more representative of comorbid illnesses and therapy, in addition to the milieu in which these patients reside. The elderly have an increased incidence of bacteremia, urinary tract infection, diverticulitis, pneumonia, infective endocarditis, disseminated fungal infection, and reactivation of tuberculosis.36, 161 Although immune dysfunction probably plays a role in these infections, the increased susceptibility of the elderly to infection may in part represent a synergistic effect of comorbid illnesses, nutritional status,134, 161 and age-dependent organ dysfunction.36, 178\n",

Impaired T-cell responsiveness and anergy are known immunologic sequelae of malnutrition and may contribute to the immune dysfunction of the elderly.111, 161 The provision of nutritional, vitamin, and trace element supplementation for 8 weeks resulted in improved skin test response, increased T-lymphocyte numbers, and responses to mitogen.31 Zinc may be especially important. Animal studies involving zinc-deficient mice have demonstrated reversible thymic involution and T-cell dysfunction with adequate zinc replacement.56, 64 These studies have relevance in the elderly because the prevalence of deficient zinc intake and measurable zinc deficiency are 24% and 14%, respectively.30 In a randomized controlled trial in institutionalized elderly, the administration of 220 mg of zinc sulfate twice daily resulted in increased numbers of circulating T lymphocytes, enhanced delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity, and immunoglobulin G response to tetanus vaccine.42 Four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials involving zinc administration for the common cold have demonstrated a decrease in symptoms when compared with placebo.3, 43, 71, 137 Four additional randomized controlled trials failed to document any clinical improvement with administration of zinc gluconate for the common cold, and in addition found no change in viral shedding.40, 54, 173, 190 There are numerous proposed mechanisms by which zinc might exert some antimicrobial action,137 but its clinical role has yet to be worked out. The precise role of vitamin replacement is not established, but clearly adequate caloric and nutritional support are important in the elderly.",

            "text": "Chronic obstructive lung disease is a predisposing factor for pneumonia in the elderly, but asthma is not generally considered a significant independent risk.51, 61, 133 Koivula et al,108 however, in a population-based study of individuals more than 60 years of age in Finland, noted the prevalence of asthma to be 3.5%.108 When compared with those patients who did not develop pneumonia, the adjusted relative risk for contracting pneumonia in asthmatics was 4.2 (95% confidence interval [CI], range 3.3\u20135.4), suggesting that asthma itself may predispose patients to develop infection. The presence of lung disease and bronchial asthma did not increase the risk of death. Postulated mechanisms by which asthma causes host immune system dysfunction have been reviewed (Table 1)\n.10, 25, 27, 84, 85, 97, 98, 117, 148, 149 In addition, mucociliary transport may be slowed by as much as 72% during an acute exacerbation.130 Multiple authors have described impaired mucociliary transport in asthmatic patients.10, 25, 97, 105, 117, 149 In addition, hypogammaglobulinemia was 4.8 times more likely to be identified in unselected asthmatics than in the normal population.85 Of note, 10 of the 12 patients with hypogammaglobulinemia received a cumulative prednisone dose (or its equivalent) of \u2265 5 mg/day for at least 2 years. Because asthma in the elderly is less likely to be responsive to conservative therapy, more elderly asthmatics will be at risk of suffering the combined immune-altering effects of age, comorbidity, and immunosuppression.18 In a survey of consecutive geriatric asthmatic patients in their pulmonary practice, Braman et al19 noted that 22 of 25 patients more than 70 years of age required oral steroids in addition to inhaled corticosteroids, highlighting the potential clinical significance of iatrogenic immune deficiencies. The previously described immune host defense dysfunction may be significant, but may be less important than the combined effects of comorbid disease(s). Asthmatic patients more than 65 years of age have been shown to have six- to 10-fold higher mortality than younger patients, partially attributable to complicating illnesses and therapies, but in addition attributable to delays in presentation, increased noncompliance with medications, poor nutrition, and isolated living situations that predispose them to poorer outcomes.18, 34, 151, 162\n",

Many studies have attempted to identify historical, clinical, and laboratory parameters by which physicians could appropriately stratify patients with pneumonia with respect to their need for hospitalization and intensive care.17, 54, 61, 83, 120, 143 Farr et al54 reviewed prognostic factors obtained by history that have been associated with death from pneumonia, and they identified 18 studies that showed an association between older age and death. Nine of the studies found an association using univariate analysis, and two studies found an association using multivariate analysis.20, 37 In a recent study evaluating the utility of radiographic presentation of community-acquired pneumonia, the overall mortality rate of patients 65 years of age or older was 10.2% as compared with the 1.8% mortality rate of patients 45 to 64 years of age, further highlighting the risk of age and infection.83 In a metaanalysis, Fine et al62 noted 14 cohort studies that evaluated the association of age and mortality, with a mean age difference in survivors versus nonsurvivors of 7.8 years. In the same study, logistic regression analysis performed on 85 cases noted an odds ratio of 1.05 (95% CI, range 1.01\u20131.09) of death for each 10-year increment in mean patient age. Although this metaanalysis found age to be significantly associated with death, the weight of comorbid illness was not addressed. Studies by Esposito et al,46 Black et al,17 and Lipsky et al,120 which corrected for comorbid factors, found that age was not a significant risk factor for mortality. Using retrospectively derived prognostic parameters, Black et al17 noted that ambulatory elderly patients were more likely to be admitted with pneumonia than younger patients. When a multivariate analysis was performed controlling for comorbid conditions, age was no longer predictive.17 In a retrospective case control study, Lipsky et al120 noted dementia, seizure disorders, and institutionalization to be associated with acquiring pneumococcal infections. In the same study, age was not significantly associated with pneumococcal pneumonia when corrected for comorbidities. These observations support the overriding importance of an individual's physiologic status as a determinant for initiating invasive life-saving medical therapy.",

As previously mentioned, Koivula et al108 showed that elderly asthmatics have an increased risk of pneumonia when compared with the general age-matched population, suggesting that asthma per se may predispose elderly patients to pneumonia. Although this is a tenable hypothesis it is unclear whether comorbid illness or therapy with corticosteroids might have prevented detection of the separate effects of asthma as a risk factor for pneumonia. More extensive work has gone into trying to elucidate the mechanism by which infections may affect the risk of or perpetuate the course of asthma. Similarly it is not totally clear whether asthmatic patients have a different incidence or worsened prognosis with viral, bacterial, or combined infection.",

The role of infection in the pathogenesis of asthma and its exacerbations in adults continues to be controversial. Few studies have separated bronchial asthma from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hence there are few if any clinical data demonstrating whether asthma predisposes one to develop respiratory tract infections. In the only study addressing bronchial asthma as an independent comorbidity, Koivula et al108 noted bronchial asthma to be second only to alcoholism as a risk for pneumonia. This study, involving elderly independent Finns, showed that asthmatics had an adjusted relative risk for pneumonia and hospitalization of 4.2 (95% CI, range 3.3\u20135.4) and 6.0 (95% CI, range 4.1\u20139.0), respectively, when compared with the remainder of the population.

In the prospective phase, three (11%) of 27 patients with pneumonia and 16 (4.7%) of patients with bronchitis had positive serology for C. pneumoniae. Of these 19 infected patients, three (16%) had wheezing with their acute infection, and six (32%) developed bronchospasm during the ensuing 6 months. After controlling for confounding variables, a C. pneumoniae titer of 1:16 or more was associated with an odds ratio of 2.1 (95% CI, range 1.1\u20134.2) for developing wheezing. In the matched control phase of the study, 29.6% of C. pneumoniae\u2013positive patients compared with 7% of controls were diagnosed with asthma, with an odds ratio of 7.2 (95% CI, range 2.2\u201323.4). This finding was further substantiated by demonstrating a dose\u2013response relationship between titers and the presence of wheezing. C. pneumoniae titers of 1:16 and 1:128 or more were associated with odds ratios for wheezing of 1.2 (not significant) and 3.5 (significant), respectively. Eighty percent of patients diagnosed with asthma following their illness had a C. pneumoniae titer of more than or equal to 1:64, and of these six (75%) developed chronic asthma following bronchitis, and one (12.5%) following pneumonia. Asthmatic bronchitis was more likely to occur in older reinfected patients, raising the question whether C. pneumoniae might have exerted an immune-mediated effect on the lung.73, 80\n",

            "text": "In a follow-up study composed of asthmatics with and without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), Hahn and Golubjatnikov81 reported 100% C. pneumoniae seroreactivity in asthmatics, 80% seroreactivity in asthmatic bronchitis patients without antecedent asthma, and 52.8% seroreactivity in patients with nonwheezing respiratory illness. Additional studies have had similar results associating C. pneumoniae with asthma.5, 79, 80, 81, 150 A recent community-based open-label treatment trial involving asthmatic patients with a mean C. pneumoniae titer of 1:128 showed significant improvement in 54% of patients after 4 weeks of varying antimicrobial treatments (doxycycline, azithromycin, or erythromycin), as reflected by improvement in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and symptoms.79 Nonresponders were more likely to be receiving inhaled corticosteroids, to have a lower mean FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio at baseline, and to have a significantly longer history of asthma symptoms prior to treatment. This is an interesting study, but it is hampered by the lack of a control arm and the association of significant impairment of pulmonary function tests prior to testing in the nonresponder arm. Grayston74 found the incidence of wheezing and asthma to be no higher in C. pneumoniae than M. pneumoniae or viral respiratory disease (respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], influenza A and B, and adenovirus). This recent recognition of the association of C. pneumoniae with asthma is yet another linkage of infection to an inflammatory condition. The exact implications of the Chlamydia-asthma association are yet to be defined and further study is needed to characterize improved diagnostic and therapeutic options available to clinicians.",

Pattemore et al146 reviewed the epidemiology of viral illness and asthma and noted four studies in children that identified significantly elevated virus isolation rates in symptomatic asthmatics, compared with asymptomatic asthmatics.91, 93, 100, 132 Rhinoviruses have been associated with the majority of cases of virus-mediated infective asthma, with RSV, parainfluenza, adenovirus, influenza virus, and coronavirus comprising the remainder.11, 101, 135, 146 Lemanske et al116 induced rhinovirus infections in 10 adults allergic to ragweed, noting increased airway reactivity to both allergen and histamine provocation. In addition, eight of 10 patients experienced a greater than 15% decline in FEV1 within 6 hours of the antigen challenge. In a longitudinal study of adult asthmatics 19 to 46 years of age, Nicholson et al141 identified nonbacterial pathogens in 44% of asthma exacerbations associated with cold symptoms. Twenty-four percent of laboratory-confirmed infections were associated with significant airflow obstruction. In this study, viral pathogens accounted for 93% of all infections, of which rhinovirus and coronavirus accounted for the majority. In children identification rates during exacerbation have approached 20% to 60%.26, 91, 100, 129, 131 Viral respiratory tract infections are likely to play a role in adult exacerbations but to a lesser extent. Viral identification rates during exacerbation in adults range between 10% and 19%.11, 93, 94, 146 Minor et al131 and Hudgel et al93 noted that viral isolation rates in adults were significantly lower than rates in children (10% to 13% versus 40% to 60%).93, 94, 129 In a small prospective study involving adult asthmatics 15 to 59 years of age, Beasley et al11 reported an overall viral isolation rate of 10%, which increased to 36% in association with severe asthma exacerbations (FEV1 < 60% or peak expiratory flow rate < 40%). Sixty percent of viral respiratory tract infections were associated with an acute asthma exacerbation. In a study of 253 exacerbations in 67 asthmatics, Kava106 found that 25% of asthma exacerbations were associated with symptomatic respiratory tract infections, and 55% of respiratory tract infections were associated with an asthma exacerbation. In the same study, viral-associated asthma exacerbations had a more protracted course then did exacerbations unassociated with a viral illness, or an uncomplicated viral respiratory tract infection: 11.4 days versus 8.1 days versus 4.9 days, respectively. Although the isolation rates in adults are significantly lower than those in children, these studies support the notion that viruses contribute to exacerbation of bronchial hyperreactivity in adults as well as children.",

Similarly, Sokhandan et al175 obtained nasal swabs for viral isolation from 33 of 35 adults during asthma exacerbations that necessitated emergency room evaluation. In total, 55.9% of patients had symptoms consistent with an upper respiratory tract infection, yet by immunofluorescence, culture, or complement fixation testing, none of these had evidence of viral infection. Sokhandan and coworkers rationalized that despite expecting a higher isolation rate in emergency room presentations, as compared with the rates noted in ambulatory clinics, this lower rate raised significant questions about the role of viral infections in adult asthma exacerbations. Hence, there are solid yet conflicting data concerning viral-mediated exacerbation of asthma in adults, with little specific data in the elderly.",

It may cause a profound allergic reaction in atopic individuals with preexisting bronchial asthma, it may coexist by colonizing the respiratory mucosa, or it may progress to more severe invasive aspergillosis. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is the most common allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis. It is characterized by fever, malaise, sputum production with brown mucous plugs, pulmonary eosinophilia, a significant allergic response in the bronchi and skin, and proximal bronchiectasis, in the setting of established asthma or another chronic lung disease such as cystic fibrosis.103, 187 The clinical course varies from mild asthma exacerbations to severe pulmonary fibrosis following years of repeated inflammatory episodes. In 1952, Hinson et al90 first described ABPA syndrome in three patients with recurrent asthma, peripheral eosinophilia, fever, sputum production, and abnormal chest radiographs.187\nAspergillus fumigatus later grew out of sputum culture. This association of A. fumigatus and ABPA has subsequently been well documented. Although A. fumigatus is responsible for the majority of cases, the syndrome may occasionally be caused by other Aspergillus spp, as well as other fungi.147 Additional diagnostic considerations for A. fumigatus\u2013negative patients with a compatible clinical syndrome are Pseudoallescheria boydii, Candida albicans, Curvularia lunata, Rhizopus spp., Helminthosporium spp, Penicillium spp, Stemphylium spp, Torulopsis glabrata, Bipolaris spp, hawaiiensis, and Fusarium vasinfectum.\n7 No formal studies have evaluated the prevalence of ABPA in the elderly. In a recent study of asthmatics preselected for having positive immediate A. fumigatus skin tests, however, 28% of patients fulfilled clinical criteria for ABPA.163 Of these episodes, 36% had proximal bronchiectasis on radiographic interpretation. In this study, the over-60 age group accounted for 24% of the study population, yet was responsible for 39% of ABPA diagnoses. In addition, 46% of the over-60 patients had a diagnosis of ABPA during the study, compared with only 18% of patients younger than 60 years of age. This preliminary information highlights the potential clinical significance of ABPA in the elderly population, hence enforcing our need to consider ABPA in patient evaluation.",

Although the evidence linking viral infection to asthma exacerbations and pathogenesis is convincing in children, it is less convincing in adults. The epidemiologic studies reviewed did not focus on the elderly population, hence we are required to extrapolate the above association of virus-mediated airway hyperresponsiveness in children and younger adults to consideration of the elderly patient. This area needs more work. At one time bacterial infections were considered a likely cause of asthmatic exacerbations; however, except for the recently proposed association of C. pneumoniae and asthma, and to a lesser degree M. pneumoniae, bacteria are considered to play a minor role in recurrent episodes of airway hyperresponsiveness in children and adults alike. Methodologic limitations of easily identifying infective agents causing lower respiratory tract infections severely limits progress in this area.",

The viral influenza vaccine should be given each year in the late fall. The pneumococcal vaccine is especially important because it protects against invasive pneumococcal infection and its current formulation includes antigens from multidrug-resistant strains that would be more difficult to treat with antibiotics. Unfortunately, severely ill patients, those with comorbid diseases, and the immunocompromised elderly are substantially less likely to respond to this or other vaccines. Pneumococcal immunization is usually given at or about 65 years of age, but it should be given at a younger age to patients with cardiac, pulmonary, renal, or hepatic disease that would increase their susceptibility to invasive pneumococcal disease.55, 138, 139 There is controversy over the desirability of repeated vaccination. Dermal reactivity to reimmunization is seldom a problem in those more than 65 years of age, however, and the elderly without comorbid disease show no statistical impairment of immunologic responsiveness to the vaccine.139, 140 Five-year efficacy in immunocompetent 65- to 74-year-olds was 71% and in 75- to 84-year-olds was 67%.167 Considering that data and conceding that definitive studies with elderly asthmatics are unlikely to become available, it seems prudent to provide pneumococcal immunization to elderly asthmatic patients on the basis of their other underlying disease(s) (i.e., cardiovascular disorders, chronic pulmonary diseases, renal failure, alcoholism, or hematopoietic malignancies), to begin before 65 years of age in the most vulnerable patients with comorbid disease, and to consider repeating immunization at approximately 5- to 7-year intervals. Better vaccines and better instruments for testing their efficacy in the elderly are needed.",

Vulnerable patients are grouped together in nursing homes and often subjected to affectionate and effusive reunions with families, children, grandchildren, and other carriers of infectious microbes that can then be circulated rapidly among the susceptible residents. Adults have approximately four viral infections per year and children average six to eight per year;76 thus, it is wise for grandparents and great-grandparents to avoid contact with children likely to have active viral infection, a logical but often unacceptable choice. Rhinoviral illness is often transmitted by infectious nasopharyngeal secretions and, therefore, is potentially amenable to reduction by barrier precautions, frequent hand washing, and returning babies to their parents if they need attention for their runny noses.114\n",

The common sense benefits from covering the mouth during a cough were recognized to reduce risks of transmission of tuberculosis in the 1960s,155 and are also applicable to reduce transmission of certain viral infections. We need to document and expand our repertoire of ways of interrupting transmission of viral infections to our elderly and infirm patients. Risks of respiratory infection can also be associated with vocational or recreational exposures. Geographic and exposure risk factors associated with respiratory disease that are not host-specific for asthmatic patients are shown in Table 3\n.",

Likewise, criteria for assessing the severity and need for hospitalization for an asthma attack are well defined and distinct from diagnostic assessment and criteria for hospitalization for pneumonia. This article addresses issues relevant to lower respiratory tract infection in elderly patients who happen to have asthma. In most instances concomitant asthma will have little effect on the most common bacterial causes of pneumonia in that group. In rare instances protracted therapy with high doses of corticosteroids may reactivate tuberculosis or opportunistic fungal or nocardia infections. Likewise Pneumocystis carinii infection can complicate high-dose corticosteroid therapy in relatively normal hosts. It is well to keep these situations in mind, but they are extremely rare (Table 4)\n.",

Patients usually require protracted therapy with prednisone, and their disease often relapses when the prednisone dose is reduced. Treatment with antifungal agents has been limited by the inability of current antimicrobials to eradicate aspergillus from bronchopulmonary tissues. At least three nonrandomized studies, however, have demonstrated a benefit from oral itraconazole therapy coupled with steroid therapy,38, 67, 144 as reflected by reduction in serum immunoglobulin E, eosinophilia, and improvement in FEV1 during therapy with itraconazole.38, 124 These studies support an adjunctive role for itraconazole that may permit reduction, or rarely cessation, of prednisone ABPA therapy. Controlled trials are needed to document the validity of this contention. Likewise, evaluation of newer, more potent therapy for aspergillus pulmonary infection is badly needed.",

            "text": "In conclusion, asthma is underrecognized in the geriatric population and has some special considerations. Although data are lacking in the elderly, epidemiologic studies in younger age groups strongly suggest the causative and provocative roles of infection in asthma. Future evaluation must be performed to better characterize what role viral and bacterial infections have in the geriatric population. As the role of C. pneumoniae and other infections in asthma is better defined, more specific therapy may be possible. The normal lung defense mechanisms decline with age, but clinical disease and therapeutic strategies are more dependent on organ dysfunction and underlying comorbid diseases. Thus assessment and specific therapy are dependent on an individual's physiologic health rather than chronologic age. For now, selection of therapy should be based on host vulnerability, the epidemiologic risk of infection, the severity of the patient's infection, and the virulence of potential pathogens. Although conceding the importance of antimicrobial therapy once infection occurs, one must continue to stress the importance of good hygiene, adequate nutrition, proper surveillance of the patient's asthma, and more vigilant use of vaccines to prevent infection in asthmatic patients.",
