Its effects on residents' health, especially on respiratory health, can't be overlooked. Children, as the susceptible populations, the respiratory disease incidence of them are considerably higher than that of adults. According to the statistics, as usual, the frequency of common cold for adults were 2\u20135 times per year, and 4\u20138 times for children [1]. Research results from America [2], [3], Finland [4], Italy [5] and so on also demonstrated that children are the high-risk group of respiratory disease. The researchers observed that there is a periodic surge increase of fever and acute respiratory infection on Pediatric Clinic in Shanghai, China [6]. Therefore, the pathological mechanism and influence factors of respiratory infection for childhood are becoming the research hotspot gradually.",

In consequence, plenty of researches have been conducted to explore the association between indoor environment factors and childhood respiratory disease. Dong, G., et al. [13] assessed the effects of housing characteristics and home environmental factors on respiratory symptoms of Chinese children by cross-sectional survey. It has been drawn that home environmental factors including visible mold on walls are particularly important for the development of respiratory morbidity among children. Wang, J. [6], [14] conducted the research on domestic environmental factors and its associations with health in Chongqing during 2008\u20132011. Lowen, A.C., et al. [11], stated that influenza virus transmission is dependent on relative humidity and temperature. Lin, Z., et al. [15]found the associations of home dampness signs with childhood asthma and allergic diseases in Urumqi. Hu, Y. [16] performed the research on the association between home dampness and asthma related symptoms among pre-school children of Shanghai during 2011\u20132013. Norback D., et al. [17] studied associations between fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), respiratory symptoms and airway infections among students and dampness and fungal DNA in schools in Malaysia. They found that building dampness and the mound aspergillus versicolor in schools in Malaysia can be risk factors for impaired respiratory health among the students. Zhao, Z. [18], Wang, T. [19], Zhang, M. [20], Zheng, X. [21], Wang, H. [22] et al. conducted cross-sectional survey in Taiyuan, Urumqi, Wuhan, Nanjing, Chongqing and other cities in China during 2011\u20132012. All these results demonstrated that among these environmental factors, the indoor dampness increase the incidence of childhood asthma, rhinitis and other respiratory disease. Heating and ventilation mode affect the indoor air quality, meanwhile they determine the propagation and development of bacteria and virus [23]. They further might be the direct or indirect initiation factors for common cold. It has been stated that household ventilation (opening window in bedroom) were found to be strongly associated with childhood rhinitis [19], [24], asthma [25] and other allergic symptoms [26]. Low home ventilation rate in combination with moldy odor from the building structure increase the risk for allergic symptoms in children [27]. For college students, who live in the crowded dormitories with low ventilation rate were demonstrated to have more common colds [28]. Therefore, to investigate the effects of household ventilation and indoor environmental dampness exposures on childhood respiratory disease is urgent and important.",

Most of them were in medically, including the mechanism of influenza virus propagation [29], [30], the prevalence of cough [31] or common cold, the vaccines for common cold [32], the duration of common cold [33] and also the impact factors [34], [35]. However, few studies focused on the effects of dampness exposures on children's common cold, meanwhile considering the modified impact from ventilation. These two factors play a considerable role in the indoor environment and the research on them are becoming the hot topics. This study is a part of phase one in the China, Child, Homes, Health (CCHH) study which was a national multicenter cross-sectional study of the home environments and childhood asthma, allergies, and airway diseases [36]. Based on the results from a cross-sectional survey in phase one and the data from environment measurements of residential buildings in phase two, the prevalence of children's allergic diseases, such as asthma, rhinitis, eczema and so on, and the associations between them and building environment have been illustrated. However, neither the prevalence of children's respiratory tract infection (RTI), namely common cold, in Shanghai, nor the risk factors of indoor environment for residential buildings were revealed. This study aims to discover how the low ventilation rate effects home dampness in residential buildings and further becomes the risk factor for common cold of children. The interaction effects of these two factors on children's common cold were also investigated.",

Childhood asthma and allergy symptoms, such as diagnosed rhinitis, eczema and current wheeze, dry cough, croup, and other health problems, as pneumonia, common cold and so on were all taken as questions to request the report. These allergic and respiratory diseases were common and uniform in epidemiology and public health, so they were available for children's health study. In addition, the questions about home environment and lifestyle behaviours from the Dampness in Building and Health (DBH) study in Sweden [38] were adopted in this study by translation. Questions on home environment covered from residential building characteristics, renovation status, air conditioning equipment to dampness exposures and window opening frequency. All of these questions were in accordance with current conditions of China, like the construction year (before 1980, 1980\u20131990, 1991\u20132000, 2001\u20132005 and 2006 until the survey day), the materials of bedroom floor and wall (categories of materials were based on the report of building materials usage in China), the exposure of quilts in the sunshine (totally chinese characteristics) and so on. In this study, the questions in relation to common cold, home dampness and frequencies of window opening were included.(1)The questions on common cold infections were \u2018\u2018How many times has your child had a cold in the last 12 months (options: <3 times; 3\u20135 times; 6\u201310 times; >10 times)\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018How long does a common cold usually last (options: <2 weeks; 2\u20134 weeks; >4 weeks)\u2019\u2019.(2)Questions on home dampness features were: \u201cAny visible mold spots (VMS) in your child's room (no/yes)\u201d, \u201cAny visible damp stains (VDS) of child's room (no/yes)\u201d, \u201cAny damp on clothing/beddings (DCB) (no/yes)\u201d, \u201cAny water damages (WD) in the apartment (no/yes)\u201d, \u201cCondensation on window panes (WPC) (no/yes)\u201d and \u201cAny mildewy odor (MO) (no/yes)\u201d.(3)Questions on frequency of window opening were categorized by seasonally: \u201cHow about the frequency of the window opening in your child's room: a) in spring, b) in summer, c) in autumn, d) in winter (options: Never; Sometimes; frequently)\u201d.\n",

Gamma correlation analysis was used to investigate correlations between window opening mode and environmental dampness because the variables are dichotomous (Yes vs. No). Logistic regression analysis was applied to investigate crude associations between indoor environmental dampness, frequency of window opening and children's cold symptoms. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to adjust the potential confounders, which included age (4 vs. 5 vs. 6-years-old), gender (male vs. female), family history of atopy, residence location (urban area vs. suburb), ownership of residents (Tenancy vs. Owned) and current environmental tobacco exposure (Yes vs. No). Associations would be indicated by crude odds ratio (OR) and adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). The significance in statistical analyses would be indicated by p value < 0.05. The multiplicative interaction between household ventilation and dampness-related indicators on cold symptoms of children was addressed by multiple logistic regress model and Cox model, meanwhile the spreadsheet proposed by Knol MJ [43], [44] and Andersson [45] was adopted to analyze the additive interaction and 95% confidence interval between them. The relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI = RR11 - RR10 - RR01 + 1), the attributable proportion due to interaction (AP = RERI/RR11), the synergy index (S= (RR11-1)/[(RR01-1)+(RR10-1)]) were three indexes to estimate the interaction effect of household ventilation and dampness-related indicators. There are strong indications that the estimated effect on the additive scale of two investigated factors if the RERI is above 0, S above 1 and P-value < 0.05. To evaluate the effects of missing data of dampness related exposure options on questionnaires, the sensitivity analyses were conducted. All of the missing data were set as 1 and 0 respectively to inspect the difference of results. The abnormal error of tested relative humidity was eliminated firstly. The range between 25th-1.5IQR and 75th + 1.5IQR (IQR\u2013inter quartile range) was used as non-outlier range [46], and then the mean values accompanied with quartiles were calculated. SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Ltd., USA) was used for statistical analyses.",

Fig. 2\ndisplays the frequency of window opening in four seasons of these residential buildings. Residents are used to opening windows for ventilation in summer more often than that in winter. About sixty-two percent (61.9%) families \u201cAlways\u201d open the windows in summer. Corresponding to this, 36.1% families \u201cNever\u201d open their windows in winter. Even though in spring and in autumn, there are also more than 10% families who \u201cNever\u201d open the windows in their child's room. Based on this distribution information, window opening index (WOI), which is a principle from the perspective of a year, is further proposed to reveal the situation of residents' natural ventilation habits. It could be defined as \u201cRarely\u201d (assigned as 0), when this family \u201cNever\u201d open their windows in no less than two seasons; \u201cOften\u201d (2), when this family \u201cAlways\u201d open their window in no less than three seasons; \u201cSometime\u201d (1), when the window opening mode of this family belongs to those excluding situations described above. Based on this new index, the window opening information of all these families was reorganized. 14.9% families \u201cRarely\u201d open their window in children room, while 31.1% others \u201cOften\u201d have window opening. About half of them (54%) open their windows \u201cSometimes\u201d. This index could also be considered as the natural ventilation condition in qualitatively.

For a single family, there might be several dampness-related indicators reported, so the total number of dampness-related indicators was proposed here to describe the dampness level, and it could be expressed as n, where it might be equal to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. The frequency of the total dampness-related indicators is displayed in Fig. 3\n. The valid samples for this statistics were 8068 by abandoning the sample missing any value of these six dampness-related indicators. It demonstrates that the residential buildings with one or two kinds of dampness exposures accounted for 49.3%. In other words, half of the residence in shanghai have more than one dampness problem. Less than 1% residence was exposure to the environment with all six dampness-related indicators. The analysis on the validity of subjective questionnaire in evaluating dwelling home dampness and indoor odors based on Cross-sectional survey and on-site inspection in Shanghai have been already conducted before [48]. In the paper, the consistency of the dampness exposures from children's parents-reported questionnaires in Phase I and on-site tester inspection in Phase II were analyzed. According to the observed, positive, and negative proportional agreement (Po, Ppos, and Pneg), parents and inspectors had substantial/prefect consistencies in dampness exposure indicators (Po = 0.51\u20130.96).

Good natural ventilation was positively associated with less dampness exposures, which could also be illustrated by the adjusted odds ratio for dampness index in Fig. 4. With the \u201cfrequent\u201d natural ventilation as reference, the risk of household ventilation on each dampness level was significant. Poor natural ventilation resulted in severe dampness level for AOR value above 1 and poor ventilation had a stronger association with high dampness level for the AOR value grew up with dampness index increased (the highest one presented at DI equal to 5, AOR, 95% CI: 1.60, 1.24\u20132.08). It provides a strong evidence that poor home ventilation could encourage dampness problems generation. This has been stated by previous research. H\u00e4gerhed-Engman et al. has also presented that a moldy odor along the skirting board and severe moldy odor in indoor air were significantly associated with a low ventilation rate [27], [52]. The primary results from phase II in our group have also provided the general evidence on this statement. The concentration of CO2 for 24 h in children's bedroom was recorded and it was then taken as the trace gas to calculate the natural ventilation rate. The average values were 1.51 h\u22121 and 2.28 h\u22121 for day and night time respectively. High risk of moldy odor, visible mold in the wall covering and window pane condensation was associated with low ventilation rate. Moreover, ventilation rate in winter was lower than that in summer and with the increasing of it, the frequency of children cough and eczema decreased. Therefore, the significance of home ventilation is noticeable. To eliminate indoor dampness problems, providing favourable home ventilation is efficient.",

From the perspective of common cold mechanism, there are numerous virus inducing upper respiratory infection (common cold) [7], [53]. The rhinoviruses, coronavirus and staphylococcus aureus, one of gram-negative bacteria, were most familiar. Most of them are transmitted by air. According to the statistics, among all the viruses which cause common cold of children, rhinovirus accounts for 15\u201340%, coronavirus for 10\u201320%, and staphylococcus aureus are also one of the main viruses causing child's respiratory infection. There are variety of reproduction methods and propagation paths for different viruses. Researches indicate that indoor environmental humidity has an obvious effect on reproduction and propagation of respiratory infection viruses [54]. Taking the rhinovirus for example, high humidity condition improves the performance of the cell development. It on the one hand affects the stability of virus cell, on the other hand affects the droplet size and water capacity evaporation. Results from aerosol experiments demonstrate that rhinovirus is more stable under the high humidity condition [55]. It also illustrated that the natural decline rate is lower when indoor relative humidity is 50\u201360% than that under 35% of RH [56].",

After elimination of six items, the left questionnaires are 8086. To explore the effect of missing data on the identification of common cold risk, the sensitivity analysis was conducted. There were three cases for this analysis: 1) assigning all the missing data as 1 (existing related dampness feature); 2) assigning all the missing data as 0 (non-existing related dampness feature); 3) removing the missing data (used in this paper). The association between dampness index and common cold of children was analyzed by using these three methods. Table 6\ndisplays the results obtained from three cases. It could be found that when the missing data were assigned with 0 or 1, the adjusted odds ratio for common cold incidence and duration accordingly decreased in comparison with being assignments before. However, the AORs of case 1 and case 2 were all still above 1.00 and they were consistent with case 3, which represented that the testing results of AOR for common cold of children were insensitive to missing data of dampness index.
