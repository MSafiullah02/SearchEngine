            "text": "In 2009, over 769 million airline passengers flew to and within the United States (US Department of Transportation 2010), and over 629 000 international flights landed in the United States . The potential for these aircraft passengers to transport infectious diseases to non-infected areas is a serious public health concern, as demonstrated by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus that originated in 2002 and rapidly spread into 25 countries on five continents, resulting in over 8000 cases and 774 fatalities (Peiris et al., 2003) . The potential for intercontinental spread of infectious bacteria via passenger aircraft also exists, particularly for newly emerging strains such as multiple-drug-resistant tuberculosis Abstract Air travel can rapidly transport infectious diseases globally. To facilitate the design of biosensors for infectious organisms in commercial aircraft, we characterized bacterial diversity in aircraft air. Samples from 61 aircraft highefficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters were analyzed with a custom microarray of 16S rRNA gene sequences (PhyloChip), representing bacterial lineages. A total of 606 subfamilies from 41 phyla were detected. The most abundant bacterial subfamilies included bacteria associated with humans, especially skin, gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts, and with water and soil habitats. Operational taxonomic units that contain important human pathogens as well as their close, more benign relatives were detected. When compared to 43 samples of urban outdoor air, aircraft samples differed in composition, with higher relative abundance of Firmicutes and Gammaproteobacteria lineages in aircraft samples, and higher relative abundance of Actinobacteria and Betaproteobacteria lineages in outdoor air samples. In addition, aircraft and outdoor air samples differed in the incidence of taxa containing human pathogens. Overall, these results demonstrate that HEPA filter samples can be used to deeply characterize bacterial diversity in aircraft air and suggest that the presence of close relatives of certain pathogens must be taken into account in probe design for aircraft biosensors. (Udwadia et al., 2012; Velayati et al., 2009) . While reports of bacterial transmissions during air travel are infrequent, rare instances of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Neisseria meningitidis transmission within aircraft have been observed (Abubakar, 2010; Kenyon et al., 1996; Rachael et al., 2009; Wang, 2000) . Deliberate infection of aircraft passengers with bacterial pathogens is also a threat (National Research Council, 2006) . One measure that could mitigate infectious disease spread is rapid detection of pathogens in aircraft air prior to deplaning.",

On the basis of 2009 flight statistics, a biosensor that could be deployed in commercial aircraft arriving into the United States would require a probability of false alarm of under 10 )6 , less than approximately one false alarm per year as calculated in the studies by Hwang et al. (2011) . As such, a critical obstacle in deploying rapid onboard biosensors is to minimize false alarms that may be generated by diverse microbes in circulated air in aircraft, making the understanding of microbial background critical for biosensor design.",

            "text": "To date, several studies have assessed bacteria species present in air from aircraft (Dechow et al., 1997; La Duc et al., 2006 McKernan et al., 2008; Osman et al., 2008; Wick and Irvine, 1995) . Collectively, these studies conclude that humans and their belongings are a major source of airborne microorganisms in aircraft cabins. However, these prior studies are likely to have identified only a small fraction of the bacterial diversity present in aircraft cabins for a few reasons. First, previous studies of aircraft air employed culture methods (Dechow et al., 1997; McKernan et al., 2008; Osman et al., 2008; Wick and Irvine, 1995) and/or cloning of 16S rRNA gene sequences (La Duc et al., 2007; Osman et al., 2008) . Results from culture methods reveal only a small fraction of the total microbial reservoir (Osman et al., 2008) , especially for aerosolized Gram-negative bacteria (Heidelberg et al., 1997) . The effectiveness of culture methods is likely to be further reduced in the aircraft environment because of drying caused by the low relative humidity (<20%) and the rapid air exchange rate (of 0.5 Kg per min per cabin occupant). In addition, prior studies used grab samples that provided limited sampling, with short sampling duration (usually 3 min or less) and discrete sampling strategies (Board on Environmental Studies and Toxicology (BEST) (2002) . La Duc et al. (2007) and Osman et al. (2008) in their studies pooled samples, creating composite samples of up to 10 m 3 of air.",

            "text": "One way to accomplish the more comprehensive, integrated sampling is by collecting air samples via HEPA ventilation filters used in the air-handling systems onboard aircraft. HEPA filters are advantageous because they are expected to capture at least 99.9% of bacteria (Bull, 2008) , are aboard aircraft for months, and may collect particles from on the order of 10 7 m 3 of air during their typical 5000-h use. Even though only a small extract of filter media may be used for analysis, the amount of air sampled is large. On the order of 70 m 3 of air may flow through each square centimeter of media over the life of a typical HEPA recirculation filter. From ventilation filter material, DNA and RNA can be extracted to identify microbes present (Goyal et al., 2011; Korves et al., 2011; Noris et al., 2011) . Molecular methods relying only on extracted DNA have been used extensively in many environments to obtain a comprehensive picture of the microbial community, including indoor air environments (Rintala et al., 2008; Tringe et al., 2008) . One molecular method for sampling environments that is relatively fast and inexpensive is the use of DNA microarrays DeSantis et al., 2007) . DNA microarrays make use of short oligonucleotides probe sequences adhered to glass surfaces to assay the gene sequences present in a sample. A microarray with probes for 16S rRNA gene sequences (used for bacterial classification), called the PhyloChip, has been used to analyze microbial communities in outdoor air and many other environments (Kelly et al., 2010; Sunagawa et al., 2009; Tsiamis et al., 2008; Weinert et al., 2011; Yergeau et al., 2008) . The PhyloChip has been shown to expand the breadth of coverage of microbial diversity compared to both culture methods and cloning .",

Details of probe selection and chip design are presented elsewhere (Brodie et al., 2006 DeSantis et al., 2007) . For aircraft samples, 500 ng of bacterial PCR product was applied to each PhyloChip. For outdoor air samples, up to 2 ug of amplified PCR product had been used; most had approximately 1.5 lg PCR product loaded. For filter and reagent blank samples, as much as 40 ll concentrated product were used for PhyloChip analysis for two reasons: (i) to optimize the chance of detecting amplicons at very low concentrations and (ii) to load volumes of blank samples similar to actual samples. Ordinarily, reagent blanks are run only on a PhyloChip if visible bands are observed when loading 5 ll PCR product on a gel from a test PCR (single annealing temperature). However, for the aircraft dataset, several reagent blanks that did not produce visible bands were amplified using gradient PCR and run on the PhyloChip to assess reagent background.

The CEL files provide probe intensity values and PhyCA processing compiles the individual probe intensities into OTU. Details of how probe intensities are used in PhyCA to generate information about each sample are included in the Supplementary Materials of the study by Hazen et al. (2010) . Briefly, probe sets consisting of pairs of perfect and mismatch probes were used to distinguish real signals from background. PhyCA uses a two-step process to first select a group of OTU with positive signals (Stage 1) and then to test those signals for crosshybridization potential (Stage 2). Probes with greater cross-hybridization potential between neighboring OTU are more heavily penalized, reducing their contribution to the final output. The criteria used for Stage 1 and Stage 2 analysis for the G2 chips were Stage 1: rQ1 \u2021 0.379, rQ2 \u2021 0.565, rQ3 \u2021 0.82, pf \u2021 0.93, mean_without_hi_lo \u2021 500; Stage 2: r x Q3 \u2021 0.515 (pf is defined in the Supplemental Data S1). From Stage 2 processing results, any subfamily passing these criteria in at least one sample in the dataset is included in a subfamily report (binary calls for all samples). OTU that pass Stage 1 and are contained in subfamilies that pass Stage 2 are then included in OTU binary and intensity reports (trimmed mean intensity for perfect-match probes in each OTU). The trimmed mean intensity values are referred to as mean fluorescence intensity (MFI).",

Furthermore, total richness estimates could not be compared directly because greater PCR loading could result in a greater pool from which to draw representatives, potentially affecting the breadth of taxa detected.

First, ongoing sample collection over months does not provide for sample preservation over the long sampling period, and both degradation and growth of bacteria on the filters are possible. While desiccation would present problems for culture-based assays, it is much less of a concern for DNA-based assays. DNA can be extracted from very dry sample material (e.g., hyperarid soils, (Drees et al., 2006) ) and the desiccation process may reduce enzymatic reactions, including DNAses, though there are likely some loses of DNA, too. Another challenge is DNA extraction optimization, including addressing PCR inhibition if observed.",

Prior 16S rRNA gene cloning studies identified approximately 100 bacteria lineages representing eight phyla (La Duc et al., 2007; Osman et al., 2008) . In contrast, the current study detected 3763 OTU from 606 bacterial subfamilies representing 41 phyla. This greater diversity is probably due to the PhyloChip assay and the use of HEPA filters. The PhyloChip assay is capable of identifying up to 70-fold more bacterial taxa than traditional cloning methods (La Duc et al., 2009 ) and can detect bacteria that represent as little as 0.01% of a community . The most abundant lineages in our study overlapped with those found in previous aircraft studies. In particular, prior studies also found an abundance of Gram-positive cocci (Dechow et al., 1997; McKernan et al., 2008) , particularly Streptococcus (McManus and Kelley, 2005; Osman et al., 2008) and Bacillus (McKernan et al., 2008; Osman et al., 2008) . As in prior studies, abundant bacteria types included bacteria associated with humans (La Duc et al., 2007; McKernan et al., 2008; McManus and Kelley, 2005; Osman et al., 2008) , particularly the gastrointestinal, oral, and respiratory tracts.",

The absence of large differences between the North American and intercontinental samples collected in the same year may result from US-bound international flyers frequently flying on domestic flights to reach their final destinations. Nevertheless, the detection of multiple pathogen-containing OTU in intercontinental or unknown route samples, but not in North American samples, suggests that some human-associated microbes may be more prevalent in aircraft with particular intercontinental routes. Differences in the presence of pathogen-containing OTU between geographical routes need to be taken into account in the selection of sensor probes and suggest that sampling different route types may be important despite the overall cosmopolitan pattern.",

The results indicate that some lineages that contain pathogens, as well as close nonor weakly-pathogenic relatives, were prevalent; the pathogens in these lineages include B. anthracis and B. cereus, gastrointestinal pathogen Salmonella enterica, pneumonia, ear infection, and meningitis-causing Streptococcus pneumoniae, and the opportunistic nosocomial pathogen A. baumannii. The detection of most of these pathogen-containing lineages is not surprising, given that they contain common human commensals (S. aureus, E. coli, and K. pneumoniae) or are a common cause of disease (S. pneumoniae). Some pathogenrelated lineages were also identified in previous studies of aircraft air, including Burkholderia cepacia, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, Neisseria meningitidis, and Mycobacterium species as well as opportunistic pathogens that affect immunocompromised persons (La Duc et al., 2007; Osman et al., 2008) .

It is possible that in some cases, trace amounts of some pathogens could have been present and responsible for OTU detections. If trace amounts of some pathogens are present, then biosensor probes cannot merely detect presence or absence, but must take abundance, binding affinity, and/or viability into account. Other data, such as PCR tests for diagnostic (pathogenicity) genes, will be needed to evaluate the trace presence of pathogens.

Molecular analyses of aircraft HEPA filters could also be used after an outbreak has occurred to investigate the source of the infectious organism; a similar use has recently been proposed for building ventilation filters (Ackelsberg et al., 2011) . For biosensor development, characterizing background is critical for creating sensors with low false alarm rates. Further characterization of genetic background of aircraft and airport samples could be done using next-generation sequencing techniques, and comparisons could be made to other indoor environments as more data becomes available (e.g., from the microBEnet project, http://www.microbe.net/).

Minor differences occurred between the North American and Intercontinental groups that were both collected in 2009. A SIMPER analysis revealed that the difference in composition between Intercontinental 2008 and 2009 groups was largely due to the greater relative abundance in the Intercontinental 2008 samples of Actinobacteriae class OTU (Actinobacteria phylum), Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonadaceae OTU (Gammaproteobacteria subphylum), and Betaproteobacteria subphylum OTU, and greater relative abundance in the Intercontinental 2009 samples of Firmicutes OTU (especially from Bacilli and Clostridia classes), Planctomycetes OTU, Solibacteres class OTU (Acidobacteria phylum), and Treponemaceae family OTU (Spirochaetes phylum).",
