Although the term BRD can refer to a host of complex diseases this term is generally used to refer to an animal displaying an undifferentiated fever as well as some number of clinical signs. As discussed by Jericho and Kozub (2004) the presence of BRD is common in intensively raised calves and the industry dependence on antibiotic treatment is high. Such management practices are becoming increasingly scrutinized in many countries due to concern regarding antibiotic use and the potential promotion of antibiotic resistant microbes (Fleming, 1998, Jericho and Kozub, 2004). This situation is in fact also becoming a growing issue in the popular press (Zimmerman and Zimmernan, 1996, Mellon et al., 2001).",

As discussed by Cusack et al. (2003) the effectiveness of treating BRD depends primarily on the early recognition and treatment. Unfortunately, traditional clinical signs of BRD are known to often occur late into the course of the disease. By contrast, Humblet et al. (2004) demonstrated the utility of acute phase proteins, particularly haptoglobin and fibrinogen, as early indicators of bronchopneumonia in calves. However, measurements of acute phase proteins requires collection of biological samples and complicated laboratory-based analysis that cannot be performed in situ.",

In a review of the behaviour of sick animals, Hart (1988) describes and references the observation that the acute phase fever response is initiated by endogenous pyrogens such as interleukin-1 following infection from many known microorganisms. The value or function of such a fever is thought to be in enhancing the animal\u2019s ability to combat infection. The mechanisms involved are shown to include the increase of neutrophils, an enhanced lymphocyte proliferation as well as an enhanced antibody synthesis.",

In fact it is considered by some researchers to be difficult to even place and raise calves in feedlots without using antibiotics (Jericho and Kozub, 2004). Again, this is a practice that is increasingly considered undesirable. The European Community\u2019s Scientific Steering Committee for example has recommended against the abundant use of antibiotics in the livestock industries (Jericho and Kozub, 2004). The primary objective of the present study was to investigate the use of infrared thermography in the early identification of spontaneously occurring BRD. Perceived advantages of the infrared thermography technology were that diagnosis could be made in real time and could be conducted non-invasively. However, a comparative test of the IRT technology under spontaneous conditions was considered prudent.",

These studies were conducted at the Lacombe Research Centre beef research facility and all management practices followed Canadian Council of Animal Care guidelines (Canadian Council on Animal Care, 1993) and Canadian Beef Cattle Code of Practice guidelines (Agriculture Canada, 1991). In addition, the research protocols were reviewed and approved by the Lacombe Research Centre animal care committee. The cattle demographics for the initial procurement of 171 animals involved; ninety three (93) head of multiple sourced, co-mingled, weaned, auctioned and transported commercial calves in 2003/2004; fifty (50) head of commercial calves in 2004/2005; twenty eight (28) head of calves in 2004/2005 consisting of 15 commercial calves and 13 single sourced calves. These calves were chosen in order to provide study groups displaying a bovine respiratory disease (BRD) incidence range of 30\u201360% which is typical of the beef industry in Canada for these types of cattle. Data used in the present study for true positive and true negative animals is corrected for any health aberrations due to non-respiratory disease (example pink eye, foot rot) and for any data that could not be verified. For example, a calf received at the Lacombe beef research unit displaying keratoconjunctivitis (pink eye), pododermatitis (foot rot) or an infected wound of any other kind would be examined by the Research Centre veterinarian and placed on a treatment program. While it is recognized that such animals are also of interest and importance from a herd health perspective, these animals were also not ill due to BRD nor, for the purpose of a gold standard, was the time of the onset of their condition known. Thus, such animals would risk biasing the BRD population data and were not considered part of the BRD data set. This verification process left 133 calves in the study from an initial 171. For the cattle under study at the Lacombe Research Centre, the weaned calves were typically received in the afternoon having undergone transport for approximately 8 h, handling and co-mingling. These calves were offloaded into clean holding pens, given access to water and allowed to rest for a few hours prior to being processed. Processing consisted of measurements for haematology, clinical scores, salivary cortisol, infrared thermal measurements and body weights. Blood samples for haematology and serology assessment were collected by venous puncture of the jugular vein. For this purpose animals were briefly restrained in a conventional hydraulic cattle handling catch. Repeated measures were made on all animals at approximately weekly intervals. Animals were maintained on cereal grain silage rations which met or exceeded NRC (1984) recommendations. Any animals deemed ill either by direct veterinary assessment or under veterinary guidance were provided with routine antimicrobial therapy and/or other treatment and support until recovered. All calves were vaccinated for common BRD agents including clostridia, bovine viral diarrhoea and infectious bovine rhinitis at the end of the research study.",

The approach of subjective \u201cjudging \u201cwho might be ill and who might be well, on the basis of pen checking, has been found wanting in the cattle industry. Hence, the use of a gold standard has been deemed useful in both human (American College, 1992) and animal clinical studies (Galen and Gambino, 1975, Thrusfield, 1995). Several research groups have developed gold standards for the presence of BRD and there tends to be common aspects to all standards. In the current study we based our gold standards around parameters for normal and non-normal parameters as per the approach followed by Humblet et al. (2004). In the current study, the criteria for a gold standard for true positive disease was defined as any animal displaying two or more of the following symptoms: A core temperature of 40 \u00b0C or higher, a white blood cell count of less than 7 or greater than 11 \u00d7 1000 \u03bcL\u22121, a clinical score of 3 or higher and a neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio of less than 0.1 or greater than 0.8. A true negative animal was defined as any animal displaying one or fewer of the above signs or symptoms. These parameters are consistent with ranges for normal or abnormal parameters suggested by several clinical texts (Blood et al., 1983, Kaneko, 1980) as well as historical data from our own lab. Using the above criteria, true positive and true negative populations of animals were established.",

For infrared scans (IRT) the data was representative of orbital maximum temperatures collected with a FLIR S60 camera (FLIR Comp. Boston, MA) from approximately 1 meter distance. Digitized infrared images were collected and saved in greyscale. Each greyscale pixel corresponded to a specific temperature. Pseudo-colours (Fig. 2) were added or generated by computer enhancement. An orbital image was obtained by auto tracing a circle over the orbital area including the eyeball and approximately 1 cm of surrounding skin of the eye socket. This area including the lachrymal gland is, in the author\u2019s observation, very sensitive to thermoregulatory changes associated with stress and disease conditions.",

The viruses assessed were Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR), Bovine virus diarrhea (BVD), Corona virus, PI3 (Bovine para-influenza) and BRSV (Bovine respiratory syncytial virus). Assessment of viral presence and titres was done by either ELISA methods (PI3, Corona and BRSV) or serum neutralization methods (IBR, BVD) and was performed by Prairie Diagnostic Services (Saskatoon, Saskatchewan). The titre values for these viruses are shown in Table 5. For samples analysed by ELISA methods (BRSV, PI3 and Corona), antigen and tissue control well plates were used. Antibody concentrations are expressed by measuring the optical density as a percentage of a positive control serum whereby: (mean net optical density of test serum \u2212 mean net optical density of fetal bovine serum)/(mean net optical density of positive standard \u2212 mean net optical density of fetal bovine serum) \u00d7 100 = units.",

The authors appreciate the fact that there are often debates regarding the optimal composition of parameters to define a gold standard. Predictably, some debate would likely also arise regarding the parameters and values used in the present study. However, as seen in Table 1, the development of a gold standard set of values as used in the present study was nonetheless seen to be efficacious as a decision tool for BRD onset and in establishing true positive and true negative subsets in the calf population. This arguably is more accurate than simply trying to utilize a single subjective score or opinion for illness as is a common industry standard practice in such situations.",

While none of the tests are perfect, as evident in Table 1, when an animal is actually verifiably ill a number of tests including clinical scores, core temperatures and hematology will perform comparably well at identifying ill animals. Likewise, the predictive values of many tests (Table 3) will perform comparably well when the animals are actually ill. The challenge, however, as discussed earlier is how to develop and test predictive methods that are diagnostically relevant prior to the onset of the clinical signs of disease. In this respect, candidate methods such as infrared thermography are appealing both from the prospect of being non-invasive and, in contrast to laboratory based analysis, IRT technology can operate in real time.",

Of particular greater significance is that prior to the onset of clinical BRD infrared data was also seen to show predictive capability. Of interest was the observation that the predictive value of a comparatively non-invasive technique, salivary cortisol, likewise demonstrated a strong positive and negative predictive value as well as test efficiency compared to conventional measures such as core temperature and clinical scores. Table 4 illustrates how, with the use of a response operant characteristic curve calculation, such data could be used to optimise the prediction of positive and negative values for animals at risk of BRD and how different measurements perform. In addition to the above, the authors would, however, point out that the incidence of BRD in the animal populations used in the current study was comparatively high. A valid question therefore would remain regarding how the infrared thermography technology might perform as an early indicator of disease in animal populations displaying a lower incidence of BRD.",

In the case of infrared values just as an example, using both infrared absolute values and infrared mean ratio values in a parallel test would improve the negative prediction values and test efficiency by 5\u201310%. There are many additional ways infrared data can be utilized and only two such possibilities (absolute and mean ratio data) are presented in the present manuscript. Optimising the use of such values will be the next step in this research. Furthermore, the use of infrared thermography lends itself to a non-invasive automation of data collection. In concurrent research (Stewart et al., 2005), individual animal identification using radio frequency identification tags (RFID) and an IRT camera located at a water station have been employed to automatically collect thermal data. This situation is impossible to achieve with more invasive measures such as haematology or core temperatures.",

Animals identified early might be re-vaccinated, or simply isolated from the contemporary group to avoid viral shedding and infecting other individuals. In this regard, recent trials at Lacombe Research Centre have demonstrated that animals identified early as at risk of developing BRD benefited from the prophylactic application of respired nitric oxide (Schaefer et al., 2006). As discussed by McMullin et al., 2005, Ghaffari et al., 2006 nitric oxide is a known microcidal agent in vitro and thus may well function effectively in vivo also.",
