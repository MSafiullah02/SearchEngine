Differences in exacerbation rates between periods were tested using a \u03c72 test, in which the observed rate of exacerbations/participant-year was compared with the number expected across all time periods or between the Christmas and rest-of-winter periods. Exacerbation length and Anthonisen scores with and without the presence of RVIs were examined using a Student t test. To determine whether there was a difference among the symptom levels before, during, and after an exacerbation, daily diary data for questions 1 to 4 (e-Appendix 1) were analyzed with a repeated-measures analysis of variance with two factors: before/during/after and question. The analysis was repeated for the before and after scores only to determine if symptom levels returned to baseline after an exacerbation.",

Since this study was completed, two reports of seasonal patterns of COPD exacerbations in major clinical trials, TORCH15 and Prevention of Exacerbations With Tiotropium in COPD (POET-COPD), have been published.25 In both, in the northern hemisphere exacerbations occurred most frequently in December and January. The original characterization of a Christmas peak in COPD exacerbations12 examined data for 209,274 ED presentations for COPD in Ontario, Canada, over a 4-year period (summary data provided in e-Table 1). In every year, the last week of the year from Christmas Day to New Year's Eve had the highest number of events. That the existence of a specific Christmas effect as opposed to an elevated risk over the broader period can only be demonstrated in large administrative data sets suggests that preparing patients with COPD for the risks of winter as a whole, but not the Christmas season specifically, would be prudent.",
