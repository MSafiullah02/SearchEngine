Among the shared abundant proteins, we found a GH1 \u03b2-glucosidase and a family of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins. Olive is extremely rich in glycoside compounds that are hydrolyzed by \u03b2-glucosidases into defensive toxic products in response to phytophagous insect attacks. Assuming that Psyttalia host larvae sequester ingested glycosides, the injected venom GH1 \u03b2-glucosidase could induce the release of toxic compounds, thus participating in parasitism success by weakening the host. Venom LRR proteins are similar to truncated Toll-like receptors and may possibly scavenge the host immunity. The abundance of one of these LRR proteins in the venom of only one of the two P. lounsburyi strains evidences intraspecific variation in venom composition. Altogether, venom intra-and inter-specific variation in Psyttalia spp. were much lower than previously reported in the Leptopilina genus (Figitidae), suggesting it might depend upon the parasitoid taxa.",

They develop on (ectoparasitoids) or inside (endoparasitoids) other arthropods, consuming their tissues and ultimately killing the host. They are thus important regulators of arthropod populations in nature, and used as pest control auxiliaries in agriculture 1 . One of the challenges faced by endoparasitoids is overcoming the immune response of the host, i.e. the formation of a multicellular, melanized capsule around the parasitoid egg 2 . To ensure successful parasitism, endoparasitoids have thus evolved original strategies, the most common being the injection with the egg of various components that manipulate the host physiology (i.e. immunity, metabolism, reproduction, molting) and behaviour (i.e. movements, feeding). These components are often a complex mixture of ovarian and venom proteins 3,4 , but they also include virus-like particles (VLPs) 5 or wasp-specific polydnaviruses (PDVs) 6 .",

Indeed, although some venom proteins -e.g. serine proteases, metalloproteases or esterases -are largely shared by parasitoids, others seem specific to a parasitoid group or even species, and some are only found in a few phylogenetically distant species 3 . This suggests a rapid evolution of parasitoid venom composition, based on unidentified molecular mechanisms.",

To assess whether this variation between two figitid species that differ in their host range similarly exists in other parasitoid taxa, we compared here the venom composition of two braconid wasps, Psyttalia lounsburyi and P. concolor (Hymenoptera, Braconidae, Opiinae) that belong to the same complex of species 8 . Both Psyttalia species are used as biological control agents of the olive fruit fly Bactrocera oleae 9 and they differ in their host range. P. lounsburyi is specialized on B. oleae 9 whereas P. concolor successfully develops in B. oleae and at least 13 other fruit fly species 10 . Comparison of P. lounsburyi and P. concolor venom was performed using a combined transcriptomic and proteomic approach, and it was extended at the intraspecific level using two geographically distant African strains of P. lounsburyi (South Africa and Kenya). We also compared data with large-scale venomics results from other braconids, either associated with PDVs, as Chelonus inanitus 11 and Microplitis demolitor 12 , or devoid of PDVs, as Aphidius ervi 13 , since using various parasitism strategies could possibly impact venom evolution and composition.",

            "text": "Structure of the Psyttalia venom apparatus. As typically observed for Braconidae, the venom apparatus of both Psyttalia species is composed of venom gland filaments (which secrete venom), a venom reservoir, and a venom duct that extends into the ovipositor (Fig. 1a) . As was previously described in Opiinae 14, 15 , P. lounsburyi and P. concolor venom gland is multi-lobed, each lobe displaying an external thick layer of tissue and a central lumen filled by a large volume of venom (Fig. 1b,c) . The gland lobes are joined together at the base where the ovoid shaped reservoir is connected. The reservoir is composed of a large muscular layer surrounding a small internal volume of venom, suggesting it may serve as a \"pump\" for injecting venom at the time of oviposition rather than as a storage organ. The reservoir also shows internal structures that form intricate spirals possibly involved in maintaining the shape of the reservoir, like spiral springs, by passively counteracting the muscular contraction (Fig. 1b,c) . At the base of the venom apparatus of P. concolor, we also observed a \"round gland\" filled with large vesicles (Fig. 1c) , already described by Quicke 14 and called \"basal bulb\" by Wharton 15 . Interestingly, the round gland and the intima spirals of the reservoir showed a strong endogenous green fluorescence (Fig. 1d) , suggesting the presence of universal cellular auto-fluorophores such as NAD(P)H and flavins, pigments, or cuticular compounds 16 . No VLP or PDV in P. lounsburyi and P. concolor. Among the few studies on Psyttalia species, two had reported the occurrence of unidentified virus-like particles (VLPs) within the venom secretory cells (in P. concolor, previously Opius concolor 17 , and the close species O. caricivorae Fisher 18 ). We thus performed electron microscopy on P. concolor venom glands to search for VLPs, as well as on P. lounsburyi and P. concolor ovaries to ensure the absence of PDVs (polydnaviruses). We did not observe VLPs or vesicular material resembling VLPs in venom gland cells or venom (Fig. 2a) , nor viral structures or PDV particles in the ovarian cells and fluid close to the eggs (Fig. 2b-d) . Accordingly, Pl and Pc transcriptomes contained no transcript having similarities with genes specific of nudiviruses (from which braconid PDVs derive) or the sister group of baculoviruses. As coronaviruses and cypo-like viruses were also described in P. concolor venom glands 17 , previous observations likely corresponded to small viruses infecting the reproductive tract of the samples, as reported also in other Hymenoptera 19 . In the absence of VLPs and PDVs, secreted venom proteins are likely the main maternal actors of parasitism success of Psyttalia species.",

NEP-like proteins occur in the venom of several parasitoid wasps (Table 3) . Annexins are a family of Ca2 + -dependent lipid binding proteins believed to be engaged in membrane transport processes, although recent work suggests a more complex set of functions. Annexins normally lack signal sequences for secretion, but some members of the family have been identified extracellularly where they can act as receptors 44 . Annexins had never been described so far in the venom of parasitoids. However, some data suggest that different mammalian parasite clades possess annexins with unique properties that can be secreted and are likely involved in host-parasite interactions and host immune-modulation 45 . Moreover, some parasitic nematodes secrete an annexin-like effector into host root cells that may mimic plant annexin function during the parasitic interaction 46 . At last, it has been shown that annexins are also involved in the binding and internalization of toxins in eukaryotic cells 47 .",

They share a conserved structural architecture with an exposed reactive center loop (RCL) of about 20 amino acids, which acts as bait for target serine proteases 76 . The L. boulardi venom serpin LbSPNy was previously shown to be involved in host immune suppression 77 : it interferes with melanization in the Drosophila host through inhibition of the phenol oxidase activation. More recently, serpins were described in the venom of A. ervi 13 and M. demolitor 12 but their role in parasitism success is unknown. Another zinc-dependent metalloprotease was identified in each Psyttalia wasp, with low inter-species sequence similarity. Both proteins are weakly related to venom reprolysin-like proteins of P. hypochondriaca 22 and Eulophus pennicornis 23 . However, the sequences were incomplete and the number of matches in the venom was rather low (Tables 1 and 2; Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). GH1 \u03b2 -glucosidases. Peptides from major 2D spots at 55-60 kDa (spots 6 and 9 in Pl K and Pl SA , respectively, spots 8, 9, 10 in Pc) matched with two unisequences (one for each Psyttalia species) that encoded proteins containing a glycosyl hydrolase family 1 (GH1) domain (pfam00232) found in GH1 \u03b2 -glucosidases (Fig. 4) . The high RPKM values and number of peptides matches confirmed that the Pl_002819 and Pc_001157 unisequences, that share 97% identity (Supplementary Figure S4) , were among the most abundant in venom (Tables 1 and 2;  Supplementary Tables S2 and S3 ). The Pc sequence seems full-length, with a predicted signal peptide of 18 residues, while the Pl sequence probably lacks the N-terminal part (Supplementary Figure S4) . The 56.5 kDa predicted MW of the mature protein is close to that of the observed spot on 2D gels, suggesting none or few glycosylation, although several N-glycosylation sites are predicted. Yet, several spots were observed, having different isoelectric points, suggesting post-translational modification(s) and thus several isoforms (Fig. 4) . Two Pl and one Pc additional unisequences, not found in proteomics, shared similarities with GH1 \u03b2 -glucosidases, suggesting occurrence of a multigene family (Supplementary Figure S5) . GH1 \u03b2 -glucosidases were previously identified in venomics data from M. demolitor and A. ervi, but they did not correspond to abundant proteins (Tables 1, 2 and 3) . Finally, the venom of the ichneumonid Pimpla hypochondriaca was reported to display \u03b2 -glucosidase enzymatic activity (Table 3) .",

Molecular chaperones belonging to the heat shock protein (HSP) class, including HSP70, calreticulin and protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), were found in variable amounts in the two species (Tables 1 and 2; Supplementary Tables S2 and S3 ). Endoplasmin, also identified in transcriptomic data from both species (RPKM values of 40.85 for Pl and 63.9 for Pc) was detected in Pl venom only, suggesting a lower abundance in Pc venom (Tables 1 and 2; Supplementary Tables S2 and S3 ). In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), all these HSPs cooperate to form multi-chaperone complexes involved in the folding and export of secreted proteins. HSP70, PDI and endoplasmin are normally retained in the ER through the binding to specific receptors via a K/R/HDEL motif. Since these proteins are abundant in cells, we cannot totally exclude that their detection in the venom results from tissue contamination during venom collection from the gland. However, one of the venom PDIs, identified in both species, contains a substitution that changes the HDEL motif into a SDEL motif, suggesting a loss of binding and then of retention in the ER. Moreover, the binding of HSPs to ER receptors is labile and the retention is not absolute, allowing HSPs to be secreted and to play a role in intercellular transport and signaling 27, 28 . Endoplasmin, for example, has been associated as a chaperone with the secretion of pancreatic lipases and their further internalization by intestinal cells in rat 29 .",

Yet, very few studies were designed to evaluate how far closely-related parasitoid species differ in venom composition. Venom glands of the Braconidae M. hyperodae and M. aethiopoides were shown to express a similar set of genes 20 but analyses relied on less than ten genes, and proteomics data were only available for M. hyperodae. More recently, we evidenced striking differences in venom composition of the closely-related Figitidae L. boulardi and L. heterotoma 7 , Drosophila parasitoids differing in their host range. We observed here a rather similar protein composition of the venom of P. lounsburyi and P. concolor, albeit they also differ in their host specificity level. The host range is determined by both behavioral and physiological traits that include host choice and venom adequacy to the host (i.e. \"virulence\"). In some taxa, the diversity of venom composition could then be decoupled from the diversity of parasitized hosts in natura if specialization mainly relies on behavioral traits. For instance, although P. lounsburyi is a specialist of the olive fly in the field, it can develop in laboratory conditions on some non-natural hosts such as Ceratitis capitata. Similarly, although intraspecific variation in P. lounsburyi venom was notably evidenced for a LRR protein, the difference between Psyttalia strains from distant geographic origin was much lower than observed between L. boulardi strains 7 . Whether the level of diversity of venom differs among taxa (being lower in Braconidae than in Figitidae), or the extensive venom variation in Leptopilina wasps is specific of these genus/species remains an open and stimulating question.",

Olive is particularly rich in phenol-glucosides such as oleuropein, verbascoside and rutin, which accumulate during its development while B. olea is growing inside 40 . Oleuropein was shown to be converted into a toxic compound with a glutaraldehyde-like structure -a potent protein crosslinker -by a defense-related olive \u03b2 -glucosidase 41 . Assuming that fly larvae use a sequestering mechanism to survive within fruits during development, the injection of Psyttalia venom \u03b2 -glucosidase inside their body might result in a burst of toxic compounds that could weaken the host and increase the parasitoid probability of success. The release of sugar moieties from glycosides could also increase the amount of energy available for the developing parasitoid larvae. Although this is an attractive hypothesis, the fact remains that the alleged role of Psyttalia venom \u03b2 -glucosidase is based on the sequestration of phenolic glycosides by the olive fly larvae, which has not been tested yet.",

For instance, the role of glucosides/glucosinolates has started to be evaluated not only in insect-plant interactions but also for their cascading effects on the performance of herbivore enemies through metabolic impacts or emission of volatile products 39 . The report of the large production of a \u03b2 -glucosidase in a parasitoid venom suggests that this enzyme might participate in parasitoid phenotypes such as counter-defense and parasitism success, in addition to its well-described defensive role in plants and herbivore insects. Altogether, this study illustrates that parasitoid venom is a complex mixture of proteins whose relative abundance in a given species or group is still hardly explained. The study of a new species often reveals new types of abundant venom molecules, as exemplified here with the \u03b2 -glucosidase, and it highlights the role of gene duplication in the rapid evolution of venom and acquisition of new features. Deciphering the role of major venom proteins in Psyttalia parasitism success, especially those with no predicted function, is a key challenge. This will require further exploration using techniques such as RNAi, demonstrated as an efficient approach for impairing the production of parasitoid venom proteins 42 .",
