The COVID-19 outbreak has wreaked havoc on all sectors in China, resulting in city lockdown, traffic restrictions, work shutdown, and school cancellation, etc., first in Wuhan, then later in many other cities. Many countries have imposed travel restriction, suspended flights, and barred entry of Chinese nationals. The sudden shock of the COVID-19 has had a significant impact on the Chinese economy [2] . Containment of virus transmission has become a top priority to global public health security.",

            "text": "Researchers have been racing against time since the outbreak of the COVID-19, as little was known regarding COVID-19 virus initially. Two viral genome studies had indicated that the novel virus is closely related to SARS-CoV (one research revealing 79.5% and the other 89.1% nucleotide similarity, respectively) [3, 4] , which is reminiscent of the calamitous SARS outbreak 17 years back. Aside from viral genome studies, researchers also looked into the clinical features and epidemiologic characteristics of COVID-19 cases. Clinical manifestation of COVID-19 ranges from mild symptoms (low-grade fever, fatigue, sore throat, etc.) that resemble a common cold [5] , to severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome [6] . A study that collected more than 70 000 cases across China also reported asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 virus infection, accounting for 1.2% of total confirmed cases [7] . After emergence, the virus spread rapidly through human-to-human transmission [8] , which was substantiated by a modeling study from Los Alamos National Laboratory indicating the median basic reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 virus was 5.7 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 3.8-8.9) [9] . The mechanism behind the high infectivity of the COVID-19 virus could be explained by a study revealing that COVID-19 virus spike glycoprotein had around 10 to 20-fold higher affinity with angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) receptor that is widely distributed in human organs, than SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein [10] . In addition, the COVID-19 virus spreads mainly from person-to-person contacts via respiratory droplets or contact with infected surfaces or objects [11] . With a combination of high infectivity and easy transmission, the COVID-19 virus poses a great threat to anyone who has close contacts with an infected person, especially within families and to frontline medical staffers [12] . To make things worse, transmission from asymptomatic patients was confirmed by a case report covering a German businessman being infected by his asymptomatic Chinese business partner from Shanghai [13] . WHO issued a warning against possible transmission of COVID-19 virus from infected people before they developed symptoms. These findings have raised concerns across the globe, sounded the alarm of a dire situation, and prompted authorities to ramp up quarantine measures.",

            "text": "To what extent COVID-19 kills remains vague, as literature in terms of case fatality rate is in scarcity. Based on the data compiled by WHO, the overall case fatality rate of COVID-19 globally was initially estimated at around 2% [14] , similar with an overall case fatality rate of 2.3% from a study which collected more than 70 000 cases in mainland China as of 11 February 2020 [7] . However, the two case fatality rate figures were much lower than the result yielded from the study of Wang et al. on a case series of 138 consecutive hospitalized COVID-19 patients (mortality: 4.3%) in a hospital in Wuhan, China [15] . The reason that the study of Wang et al. had higher case fatality rate can be attributed to the large scale of the infection in the epicenter of the outbreak (more than 40 000 cases in early February 2020), the heavily strained medical system, the lack of protective suits and medical equipment (such as masks, goggles, gloves, and disinfectants). Based on the fact that the death toll of COVID-19 topped that of the SARS outbreak during 2002-2003 in less than two months, COVID-19 virus infection will deal a more substantial blow to the globe and can be more fear-mongering, than SARS. A look into deaths cases may provide more information to the public and sooth panic, as studies suggested that misinformation and inadequate information contribute to unnecessary public panic and subsequent undesirable responses [16, 17] . As there is a paucity of evidence on which population is more likely to progress into severe conditions among COVID-19 cases, here, we poured over the first batch of 38 death cases whose information were made public by Health Commission of Hubei province as of 24 January 2020, one day into city lockdown in Wuhan, with the purpose to add a new facet to current evidence.",

ACE2 is a crucial regulator of the renin-angiotensin system, and plays a regulatory role in the central regulation of blood pressure and cardiovascular function and could become an attractive target for the treatment of hypertension [28, 29] . COVID-19 virus uses the receptor ACE2 to enter into target cells [30] , precisely the same as SARS-CoV. Turner et al. [31] found that SARS-CoV infection affects the function of ACE2, so we speculate that the COVID-19 virus will also impair the function of ACE2, and then manipulate the regulation of blood pressure, and have a negative impact on patients with hypertension. On the other hand, hypertension can cause vascular damage. In patients with hypertension, increased vascular stiffness and decreased elasticity are common, followed by vascular remodeling and stenosis [32] . The pathological results of patients with COVID-19 showed that pulmonary vessels endothelial swelling, luminal stenosis and occlusion, leading to acute lung dysfunction [31] . The coexistence of hypertension and COVID-19 is a very unfavorable factor to induce lung dysfunction, which is prone to aggravate the condition and even result in death. ACE2 gene can also be expressed in the pancreatic islets. A study showed that the binding of SARS-CoV to ACE2 damages islets and causes acute diabetes [33] . COVID-19 virus may also exert such a negative effect on islets through the same mechanism. In persons with preexisting diabetes, the damage of islets by COVID-19 virus could be more severe, and even fatal [4, 34, 35] . In addition, ACE2 is rich in the lungs, heart, kidney, intestine, and testicles, etc. Once COVID-19 virus gains entry into the human body, more organs could be attacked by the virus through blood circulation over time [36] . Therefore, early diagnosis of COVID-19 before it progresses into severe conditions is an important measure for older people who have developed a fever and respiratory symptoms [24] . Other measures including reducing chances of exposure to infected cases (eg, banning visits to nursing home residents, avoiding gatherings), early isolation and treatment of symptomatic confirmed cases can be beneficial to the elderly population, especially those with preexisting underlying diseases.",

If we take the later reported maximum incubation period of 38 days into account [38] , a considerable part of them may have been infected in November.

Huang et al. found a similar result that 98% of the patients with COVID-19 experienced fever, 76% had a cough, and 55% had dyspnea as the first symptom, respectively [42] . However, among the deaths up to 24 January, 52.63% had a fever, 31.58% had a cough, and 23.68% had dyspnea, as the first symptom. It can be seen that not all infected cases have high body temperature as the first symptom, and the temperature change of old people is not very significant compared with young ones even when they have infectious diseases [43] . Among the severely infected elderly, 20% ~ 30% of them have no fever or slow response to fever, which is often a sign of poor prognosis [44] , and hinders early detection of infection and brings more potential risks to the elderly. Therefore, the early repeated examination is a valid response [45] . However, symptoms changed at the time of admission, with 65.79% of patients showing fever, 60.53% dyspnea, 42.11% cough, indicating dyspnea became the second major symptom. As for the COVID-19 virus infection, severe patients will have chest discomfort, progressive dyspnea, or acute respiratory distress syndrome symptoms [46] , which indicates the aggravation of the disease. As a result, the proportion of dyspnea symptoms was slightly higher than other symptoms in our deaths. Also, although there were cases with limb myalgia and fatigue, headache, and other initial symptoms came in a small quantity, it does not mean that COVID-19 cases presenting the symptoms are in mild condition. There is still the possibility of progression to death, which should arouse the vigilance of medical staff [47] .",

During the period from 17 to 20 January 2020, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 increased 10-fold [48] , indicating high infectivity of the novel coronavirus [49] . Such a disease needs to be contained, or at least the spread of it needs to be reined in time. Otherwise, the medical system will face enormous pressure, and a large number of infected patients will inevitably die due to the lack of timely treatment. During the COVID-19 outbreak, it is necessary to strengthen the training of medical personnel from all levels of medical institutions, especially those serving at hospitals designated as the treatment center for the disease. At the same time, it is necessary to invest a multitude of resources in outpatient and emergency departments to detect patients to improve the treatment conditions and the capacity to house severe cases. Since the elderly and people with underlying diseases are most vulnerable to the attack of coronavirus, and often have serious consequences [50] , it is urgent to ramp up protection and prevention measures for the elderly, especially those with chronic underlying diseases. It also warns us that in the face of an unknown disease, the protection of vulnerable people is essential.",

Second, as our study focused on the deaths in the early stage of the outbreak, and the fatalities constitute only a tiny fraction of the overall still-hiking death toll, the specific relationship between male and female, and the variations in the time window from onset to death, and from admission to death among different age groups needs more large-scale studies .",
