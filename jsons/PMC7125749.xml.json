Positive strand RNA viruses on the other hand, because their input genome directs translation, are thought to replicate exclusively in the cytoplasm. However, it has become increasingly apparent that many positive and negative strand RNA viruses whose primary site of replication is the cytoplasm use the nucleus and/or nuclear components in order to facilitate their replicative processes.",

The major nuclear functions reflect the need to transfer appropriate parts of this information to RNA (Jackson and Cook, 1995, Pombo et al., 2000), duplicate the information so that identical copies might pass to daughter cells during cell proliferation (replication) and preserve the structure of the genetic material (repair). DNA is present in the form of chromosomes and these occupy discrete nuclear territories and preferred nuclear positions (Jackson and Cook, 1995; Fig. 1\n). However, the eukaryotic nucleus also contains a number of other domains or sub-compartments, which includes nucleoli (Lyon and Lamond, 2000), nuclear Cajal bodies (Olson et al., 2002), nuclear speckles (Fox et al., 2002), and transcription and replication foci (Lamond and Earnshaw, 1998). Prior to consideration of how viruses interact with the nucleus and sub-nuclear domains, the current state of knowledge of these structures will be outlined.",

The nucleolus disappears at the start of mitosis (Dundr et al., 2000) and during G1-phase cells can contain more than one nucleolus. This is probably reflected by the fact that these cells are translationally active, and therefore require increased ribosome production. A proteomic analysis of HeLa cell nucleoli concluded that they contain some 271 proteins (Andersen et al., 2002), including nucleolin, fibrillarin, and B23. Electron microscopy revealed that the nucleolus consists of at least three different regions; fibrillar centres, a dense fibrillar component and a granular component (Scheer and Hock, 1999). These regions may have different functions. For example, the peri-nucleolar compartment has been implicated in RNA metabolism (Huang et al., 1998).",

Electron microscopy and immunoflourescence analysis showed that B23 is predominantly located in the granular region of the nucleolus, whereas nucleolin is largely present in the fibrillar centre and fibrillarin in the peri-nucleolar region. The concentration of nucleolar antigens, especially of B23 and nucleolin, appears to be controlled by the cell and depends on the physiological conditions. Nucleolin represents as much as 10% of total nucleolar protein and is highly phosphorylated, methylated, and can also be ADP-ribosylated (Ginisty et al., 1999). One of the main functions of nucleolin is processing the first cleavage step of ribosomal RNA (Ginisty et al., 1998) in the presence of U3 snoRNP (small nucleolar ribonuclear particles). Other functions associated to be dependent on nucleolin are regulation of rDNA transcription, assembly of the nucleolus, as well as nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of proteins (Ginisty et al., 1999). During interphase and cytokinesis nucleolin is associated with B23 (Sirri et al., 1997).",

Fibrillarin is crucial for nucleolar assembly at the end of telophase, the onset of rDNA transcription, the processing of rRNA and the splicing of snoRNA (Azum-Gelade et al., 1994, Fomproix et al., 1998). During mitosis, fibrillarin, as well as nucleolin and upstream binding factor (UBF) remain in pre-nucleolar bodies (PNB), which eventually localise to the nucleolar organising regions (NOR) at the end of mitosis.",

Usually they contain short stretches of lysine or arginine residues, either as mono or bipartite signals. NLSs include the \u2018pat4\u2019 motif, which consists of a continuous stretch of four basic amino acids (arginine and lysine). The \u2018pat7\u2019 motif, which starts with a proline and is followed within three residues by a segment containing three basic residues out of four (Garcia-Bustos et al., 1991), or bipartite signals (Robbins et al., 1991). Localisation of a protein to sub-nuclear structures like the nucleolus is probably a result of targeting to the nucleus via NLSs followed by an interaction between the target molecules (via a nucleolar localisation signal\u2014that is in part an NLS) and components that make up the nucleolus (Carmo-Fonseca et al., 2000, Shaw and Jordan, 1995). Whether proteins localise to the nucleolus or are retained there is uncertain. Certainly, general RNA binding proteins that are free to diffuse through the NPC might be predicted to localise to the nucleolus, where rRNA is being transcribed. In this case, such a protein would localise to the nucleoplasm and become concentrated in the nucleolus.",

Many other NESs exist but do not conform to this particular motif (Macara, 2001). Leucine rich NESs are recognised by exportin CRM1/Xpo1. The study of Crm1 mediated pathways has benefited from the isolation of leptomycin B, an anti-fungal agent that specifically inhibits Crm1 function.

            "text": "In order to disrupt or usurp nuclear functions, RNA virus polypeptides can access the nucleus by appropriate pathways. Viral NLSs/NuLS can be identified by either sequence comparison to known sequences, or experimentally, where candidate motifs have been used to target fusion proteins (such as green fluorescent protein) to the nucleus or nucleolus (Fig. 3\n). One of the first descriptions of the nuclear localisation of a positive strand RNA virus protein was in the alphavirus, Semliki Forest virus (SFV). In this case both the SFV capsid (C) protein (Jakob, 1994, Jakob, 1995, Michel et al., 1990) and nsP2 (Peranen et al., 1990) were observed to localise to the nucleus and/or nucleolus and found to contain NLSs that resembled cellular motifs. Indeed C protein was shown to contain two nucleolar targeting signals in the N-terminal region (Favre et al., 1994). The functional relevance of why these proteins would localise to the nucleus or nucleolus, and how this relates to their function in virus replication are both unknown. Non-structural protein nsP2 is involved in the regulation of minus strand RNA synthesis (Sawicki and Sawicki, 1993, Suopanki et al., 1998) and C protein is involved in nucleocapsid assembly and viral RNA binding (Owen and Kuhn, 1996, Weiss et al., 1989). However, C protein also associates with ribosomes to promote disassembly and assembly of the virus particle (Ulmanen et al., 1976, Wengler and Wengler, 1984). A conserved ribosome binding site (RBS) was identified in the C protein of alphaviruses (Wengler et al., 1992). C protein with a Mr of 33 000 may be expected to diffuse the NPC and localise to the nucleolus. However, Michel et al. (1990) showed that C protein accumulation in the nucleus was energy dependent, thus suggesting that transport across the NPC was active. C protein may localise preferentially to nucleoli via an interaction between the RBS and newly synthesised rRNA or ribosomal subunits. Although a recombinant SFV whose nsP2 contained altered NLS was reported to have identical properties to wild type virus (Rikkonen et al., 1994), recently Fazakerley et al. (2002) have reported that this change affects neurovirulence of SFV, and they speculated that this could be due to changes in processes involving RNA replication and/or the nuclear transport of nsP2.",

One might predict that these proteins would localise to the nucleus if they are below the size exclusion limit of the NPC because they are arginine and lysine rich, and therefore, might associate with high concentrations of RNA, i.e. rRNA in the nucleolus, and therefore, this localisation plays no real part of the virus life cycle. However, there are several recent pieces of evidence to argue against this. First as discussed, some of these viral RNA binding proteins are actively transported into the nucleus. Second, and perhaps one of the key clues to a functional role of nuclear localisation, has been described by Tijms et al. (2002), who, using leptomycin B, demonstrated that the arterivirus N protein used the CRM-1 nuclear export pathway in order to shuttle from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and that nuclear localisation of the protein was crucial for its function in virus assembly.",

This has also been seen in rhinovirus-infected cells in which proteins involved in nuclear shuttling accumulate at the cytoplasmic side of the NPC. The observation was attributed to the degradation of nucleoporins Nup153 and p62 (Gustin and Sarnow, 2002). The M protein of VSV and related viruses associates with the nuclear rim of the NPC and inhibits nuclear import and exit (Enninga et al., 2002, von Kobbe et al., 2000). VSV leader RNA binds heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle U (hnRNP U), which is involved in pre-mRNA processing, and may have a similar role in VSV replication (Gupta et al., 1998). Gustin and Sarnow (2002) suggested that the redistribution of nuclear proteins and disruption of the NPC might be part of a strategy by which cytoplasmic RNA viruses could avoid triggering the host immune response by blocking nuclear signalling pathways. Certainly Enninga et al. (2002) have shown that VSV M protein targets the NPC component Nup98, as part of a strategy to disrupt an interferon mediated response.",

One of these factors is the La protein, an RNA binding protein predominately located in the nucleus and involved in initiation and termination of RNA polymerase III transcription (Wolin and Cedervall, 2002). La protein was shown to enhance the translation of several viral genomes, including poliovirus and HCV (Belsham et al., 1995). However, in the case of HCV, La is required at lower concentration (Isoyama et al., 1999) than with poliovirus. As a possible mechanism to control the amount of La protein, picornavirus infection results in the redistribution of La from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, whereas this does not occur in HCV infected cells (Isoyama et al., 1999). In poliovirus infected cells La protein was shown to be C-terminal cleaved, possibly by the 3C protease (Shiroki et al., 1999). Green fluorescent protein linked to the C-terminal region of La demonstrated that this region was involved in nuclear localisation. The N-terminal region of La localised to the cytoplasm and retained the ability to enhance IRES dependent translation of the poliovirus genome (Shiroki et al., 1999).",

During poliovirus infection cellular transcription is inhibited and PTB was shown to redistributed to the cytoplasm (Back et al., 2002). In addition to having the ability to cleave La, the 3C protease also cleaves PTB, and it is these forms that are redistributed from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.

Once such protein, identified by a yeast two hybrid screen is Sam68 (McBride et al., 1996), a protein that associates with Src during mitosis (Guitard et al., 1998). During poliovirus infection this protein localises from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and associates with the viral protein 2C (McBride et al., 1996), which is involved in membrane binding (Aldabe and Carrasco, 1995) and RNA binding (Rodriguez and Carrasco, 1995) and has ATPase activity (Mirzayan and Wimmer, 1994). Sam68 has also been implicated in cell cycle control by modulating RNA metabolism, indeed Li et al. (2002) suggested that disruption of Sam68 may play a role in the G2 to M phase progression. Although it is likely that Sam68 is recruited by the 2C polymerase for its RNA binding function, by altering the distribution of Sam68 during infection, picornaviruses may also disrupt the cell cycle.",
