The first clinical sign of sepsis, fever, is usually are not typical or specific. Similarly leukocytosis is nonspecific. The more typical signs or laboratory parameters such as arterial hypotension or lactate accumulation are often are late symptoms associated with organ dysfunction and a rising mortality rate. Traditional laboratory methods for confirming diagnosis of infectious diseases involve microbial identification that relies on morphological features, growth characteristics, and biochemical substrates. Microbiologists have searched for more rapid and efficient means of microbial identification. Nucleic acid amplification technology, PCR, has opened up new frontiers for microbial identification. Advent of molecular diagnostics has provided a tool for faster diagnosis of infections. Even PCR-based methods have time limitation as they cannot be performed within half an hour required for the POC diagnosis of infections. Non-PCR methods have been developed for this purpose and the role of biomarkers that can be detected more rapidly is being explored. The diagnosis of infections will, however, continue to require a critical clinical awareness, careful patient history, dedicated physical examination, and appropriate cultures.",

The availability of accurate sepsis biomarkers to facilitate diagnosis could be useful to enable timely appropriate treatment to be started, thus optimizing a patient's chances of survival. More than 170 biomarkers have been proposed and assessed clinically, including various cytokines, cell surface biomarkers, receptors, complement factors, coagulation factors, acute phase reactants, and many others, but none has 100% specificity for sepsis. Perhaps the most widely studied biomarker of sepsis is CRP, whose role in host defense against bacteria has been known about for almost 100 years. However, CRP is sensitive but not very specific, as it is increased in all inflammatory disorders, including after uncomplicated surgery. PCT, first proposed as a biomarker in 1993, is perhaps a more specific biomarker than CRP, although it is also increased in other inflammatory conditions, such as pancreatitis or after polytrauma or major surgery.",

Infection is not an all-or-none phenomenon, and there are \"gray areas\" where one can never really be certain that an infection was present or absent. Because of their high sensitivity, sepsis markers are usually more helpful at ruling out than at ruling in an infection. This is particularly true in critically ill patients, who often have some inflammatory response, but do not always have infection or require antibiotic administration. Hence, sepsis biomarkers, by ruling out infection, could help decrease the use of unnecessary antibiotics, limit the use of excessive imaging procedures in search of a possible source, and encourage the clinician to search for alternative diagnoses. One example of this use for biomarkers was use of PCT to rule out infections in febrile patients presenting to an emergency department. In patients with suspected lower respiratory tract infection, use of antibiotics was more or less discouraged based on the PCT concentration. The result was a significant reduction in antibiotic use.",

For this role in particular, trends in concentrations over time are clearly of more value than single measurements. Again, PCT and CRP are the most widely studied biomarkers in this context. The mortality rates are substantially lower in septic patients in whom the PCT concentration decreased by more than 50% over 72 h than in the other patients (Karlsson et al. 2010) . Similarly, the pattern of change in CRP concentrations correlated with the individual clinical course in patients with community-acquired sepsis (Povoa et al. 2011) . A progressive decline in CRP or PCT concentrations can be used to guide earlier discontinuation of antibiotic therapy, without major risks. But an increase in CRP concentrations in the first 48 h of therapy suggests that antibiotic therapy may be ineffective and need reevaluation. PCT levels have been used to guide antibiotic therapy in several clinical trials in different groups of infected patients with promising results on antibiotic use. However, using PCT concentrations in an antibiotic-escalation strategy is not a wise strategy, as it may result in worse outcomes. Clearly, clinical decisions should not be based just on the concentrations of a single biomarker but must include evaluation of the clinical status of the patient and other hemodynamic and laboratory parameters. Several biomarkers of sepsis are currently available as listed in Table 9 .1.",

Unfortunately, there is paucity of specific biomarkers of mitochondrial damage in vital organs.

A prospective, randomized, controlled animal study has verified that circulating CPS-1 is a biomarker of mitochondrial damage and depletion in the liver during the subacute phase of sepsis (Crouser et al. 2006) . From a mechanistic standpoint, mitochondrial depletion is not due to cell death but is apparently related to the removal of damaged mitochondria by lysosomes, followed by repletion of mitochondrial populations. Restoration of mitochondrial populations in the liver and reduced levels of CPS-1 appears to signal recovery from sepsis. CPS-1 may be superior to conventional biomarkers of liver damage during sepsis. Further studies are needed to determine the clinical utility of CPS-1 as a biomarker of severity of sepsis.",

Only vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM) and IL-10 remained lower following the adjusted analysis.

During the onset of sepsis, a massive inflammatory reaction involving chemical mediators such as cytokines and chemokines and inflammatory cells such as the polymorphonuclear neutrophil and macrophage takes place. In addition to this systemic inflammatory process, sepsis and septic shocks cause a profound decrease in the peripheral vasomotor tone leading to a great decrease in the peripheral resistance. This event is central to derangement of hemodynamic and perfusion parameters. SIRS can be also precipitated by non-infective events such as trauma, pancreatitis, and surgery. As a consequence of an overactive SIRS response, the function of various organ systems may be compromised, resulting in multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and death. Efforts are being made to identify biomarkers for prognosis in SIRS. Sepsis causes an estimated 250,000 deaths annually in the US and 750,000 worldwide.

For reliable detection, a large number of organisms must be present. Sputum smears are positive in only onehalf to three-quarters of cases. Culture to distinguish mycobacteria from atypical forms and to determine antibiotic sensitivity takes as long as 3-6 weeks. This distinction is important because atypical forms of mycobacteria do not respond to conventional antibiotics. This time lag in diagnosis, however, delays both the isolation of this contagious disease and the initiation of treatment. The emergence of multidrugresistant (MDR) tuberculosis has further aggravated attempts to eradicate this infection.

For these reasons, identification of a biomarker of response to treatment is a high priority.

Almost 80% of those with the favorable response genotype eradicated the virus, while only about 30% with the less favorable response genotype did so. Because the genotype leading to better response is in substantially greater frequency in European than African populations, this genetic polymorphism also explains approximately half of the difference in response rates between African-Americans and patients of European ancestry. On the other hand, among African Americans who did carry the CC genotype, treatment response was 53.3% \u2212 higher than the 33.3% treatment response observed among individuals of European descent who had the TT genotype.

Cytokine profiles can also provide a usefull tool for the diagnosis and management of the SARS disease. Acute infections can cause a rapid increase in cytokine levels, an exaggerated response to a high viral load which can be detrimental to the individual. Huge elevations in a variety of cytokine markers may alert clinicians to the severity of the infection and ensure that priority patients are managed immediately to prevent further spread. Markers that have been elevated in SARS are IFN-g, IL-1b, IL-6, IL-12 and MCP-1. Cytokine response has been shown to affect the mortality and morbidity of the patient with communicable diseases. Biochip array technology (Randox Laboratories) offers a blood testing system that can offer rapid cytokine profiling of patient samples. The system uses a panel approach to diagnostic profiling enabling simultaneous measurement of numerous markers in minutes. Ease of use and minimal operator intervention are key benefits of a system that can measure and quantify many clinical markers. Risk of infection to laboratory personnel is limited as sample handling is fully automated and onboard disposal compartments ensure isolation of contaminated waste. The system boasts a test throughput of over 800 cytokine test results per hour, enabling rapid profiling of numerous patients within the time constraints of the WHO regulations.",
