The ODC and definitions for identification of overdose cases are described elsewhere [2]. Persons who died prior to December 31, 2017 were excluded. Risk factors for serious COVID-19-related illness were identified from the literature: 1) chronic pulmonary disease (including asthma, COPD), 2) diabetes, 3) hypertension, 4) coronary heart disease, 5) over 50 years of age, 6) male sex, and 7) Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (ECI) of 2+ [3,4]. To be recorded as having risk factors 1-4, persons must have had two physician billing records or one hospitalization record in a one year period from 2015-2017 [5,6]. Demographic information were extracted from the Client Roster for the year 2017 [7]. The ECI was calculated using hospitalization data for all chronic diseases excluding respiratory illness, drug abuse, diabetes, hypertension, and coronary heart disease. Chi-square tests were used to compare risk factors by overdose history. Logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratio of having a risk factor for persons who had a previous overdose compared with persons who did not have an overdose after adjusting for age and sex. Statistical significance was defined as p < .05.",

The increased likelihood of having these risk factors is reflective of the social and health inequities experienced by persons who have a history of overdose. Despite being a younger population, persons who have a history of overdose were more likely to have co-morbid physical conditions. Overdose events and chronic health conditions are likely underreported due to misclassification bias. Increasing use of take home naloxone in community settings has reduced reliance on health care providers to reverse overdose which is believed to have lowered health care utilization for overdose events. The high proportion of persons who had a previous overdose who received income assistance and experienced homelessness may suggest limited access to material resources to support physical isolation.",
