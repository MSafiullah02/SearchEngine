            "text": "The raccoon (Procyon lotor) is a medium\u2010sized mammal that is widely distributed in North America. Raccoons were introduced into Japan in the 1970s and have become naturalized in at least 42 of 47 prefectures (Ikeda et al., 2004). In urban areas, raccoons often use human houses for their dens. Raccoons use the feed stores of domestic animals as nests, and thus also have close contact with such animals (Zeveloff, 2002). It has been reported that the raccoon is a reservoir of various kinds of zoonotic pathogens in its place of origin, including the raccoon roundworm (Baylisascaris procyonis) (Gavin et al., 2005), rabies virus (Finnegan et al., 2002), Leptospira spp. (Hamir et al., 2001), and Francisella tularensis (Berrada et al., 2006). Bigler et al. (1975) found that raccoons are so adaptive that they can bridge the gaps among avian, terrestrial, and aquatic environments, and thus they are appropriate as an indicator of the prevalence of various infectious diseases and pollutants. The masked palm civet (Paguma larvata) is also a medium\u2010sized carnivore and is distributed widely in Asia. Masked palm civets are thought to have been introduced into Japan, although this contention is controversial (Abe, 2005). Masked palm civets often live in similar places as raccoons and can be carriers of human and animal pathogens, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus (Tu et al., 2004) and canine distemper virus (Machida et al., 1992).",

The animals were caught using box traps and were killed by humanitarian methods (Japan Veterinay Medical Association, 2007). Of 459 feral raccoons, 229 (49.9%) were males, 211 (46.0%) were females, and 19 (4.2%) were of unknown sex. Of 153 feral masked palm civets, 72 (47.1%) were males, 79 (51.6%) were females, and two (1.3%) were of unknown sex. The age of the feral raccoons and masked palm civets was determined on the basis of tooth eruption and cranial suture obliteration by the method of Montgomery (1964) and Junge and Hoffmeister (1980). Of 459 feral raccoons, 71 (15.5%) were juveniles (<5 months), 357 (77.8%) were sub\u2010adults or adults, and 31 (6.9%) were of unknown age. Of 153 feral masked palm civets, 47 (30.7%) were juveniles (<6 months), 104 (68.0%) were sub\u2010adults or adults, and 2 (1.3%) were of unknown age. Faecal samples were collected and preserved in Cary and Blair transport medium (Eiken Chemical Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) or sterile centrifuge tubes. The samples were then transported to the laboratory. The samples were suspended in 4 ml of sterile phosphate\u2010buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.2) and tested within a week after collection.",

All isolates identified as yersiniae were subjected to autoagglutination tests to evaluate their potential pathogenicity (Laird and Cavanaugh, 1980). Then, virulent isolates were subjected to further analysis. Serotyping of Y. pseudotuberculosis was accomplished by slide agglutination with commercial antisera (Denka Seiken). Isolates identified as Y. pseudotuberculosis were genotyped by the presence patterns of the gene encoding Y. pseudotuberculosis\u2010derived mitogen typeA (YPMa) and high\u2010pathogenicity island (HPI) so as to analyse their geographical origin using PCR assay (Fukushima et al., 2001).",

It is difficult to compare the prevalence with that in its place of origin, because there are few reports on isolation of pathogenic Yersinia from raccoons and masked palm civets (Hacking and Sileo, 1974). All of the Y. pseudotuberculosis strains showed the same genotypic pattern with the YPMa+ HPI\u2212 Far Eastern systemic\u2010pathogenicity type. Fukushima et al.

The major transmission routes of the pathogen in wildlife are suggested as preying upon infected animals or ingesting environmental substances contaminated with Y. pseudotuberculosis rather than contact with human activities (Fukushima and Gomyoda, 1991).

These results lead to the conclusion that these animals are potential reservoirs of the pathogens. The characteristics of the isolates showed that these animals probably acquired the pathogens from human activities, other wild animals, and the environment. The presence of human\u2010associated serovars and the antimicrobial resistance of the Salmonella isolates revealed the effect of human activities on these animals. This represents a typical spill\u2010over of pathogens from human activities to wildlife (Daszak et al., 2000). Meanwhile, the carrying of pathogens which are usually isolated from wildlife or from the environment (e.g. S. enterica subsp. diarizonae and Y. pseudotuberculosis) indicated that these animals could play an important role in the life cycles of those bacteria in their habitats. These findings are in concordance with their omnivore behaviour and their wide range of habitats from forests to urban areas (Zeveloff, 2002; Abe, 2005).",

Moreover, carriage of wildlife\u2010 and environment\u2010related pathogens in these animals showed the possibility of the transmission of these pathogens to humans and domestic animals. Raccoons and masked palm civets live near areas of human habitation and often nest in attics or in the feed stores of livestock. The enteric pathogens that we investigated can be transmitted to humans and domestic animals via feces, contaminated water and soil (Fukushima et al., 1988; Humphrey and Bygrave, 1988; Handeland et al., 2002). Thus, not only the ecological threats but also the public and animal health risks presented by these animals should be assessed in detail.",
