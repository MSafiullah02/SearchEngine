Such a need has stimulated research in antimicrobial textiles and polymers, and has led to development of bioprotective clothing materials and polymers that can offer instant biocidal functions against all major pathogens in recent years [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Biocidal functions can be divided into sterilization, disinfection, and sanitization in an order of the strength of the function. Biocidal functions for personal protection should be at least at the disinfection level, which can inactivate most infectious microorganisms. On the other hand, biocidal clothing materials should be safe to wear and environmentally friendly. Among many available biocides, N -halamine compounds possess superior disinfection power and safety; in fact, many of them are used as swimming pool disinfectants [7] . In addition, N -halamines have demonstrated the capability of providing rapid and total inactivation of a wide range of microorganisms without causing the microorganisms to develop resistance to them [2] .",

            "text": "N -Halamine chemistry can be expressed in Eqs. (1) and (2) . When N -halamine structures are exposed to water, the reaction shown in Eq. (1) may occur. The equilibrium in Eq. (1) may shift toward either reactants or products depending on the N -halamine structures. Three principle N -halamine structures: imide, amide, and amine, are available, and their stability and dissociation constants in water are shown (2) in Table 6 .1 [4] . N -Halamine structures can kill microorganisms directly also without the release of free chlorine, as in Eq. (2) [8] . In fact, according to their dissociation constants shown in Table 6 .1, N -halamine structures such as the amines may only release negligible amounts of free chlorine. Since N -halamine structures are biocidal, and more importantly quite stable in ambient environments, incorporation of the N -halamine into polymeric and textile materials will bring biocidal functions to them. Moreover, since Eq. (2) is a reversible reaction, the biocidal functions on the materials are rechargeable with a chlorinating agent, such as chlorine bleach. This rechargeable function is most suitable for reusable medical textiles and clothing. In this chapter, we will review the latest progresses in the application of N -halamine chemistry to textiles and polymers. Both amide and imide N -halamines have been incorporated into cellulosecontaining fabrics by a conventional finishing method with 1,3-dimethylol-5,5-dimethylhydantoin (DMDMH, shown in Figure 6 .1) [3] . Although it would appear from the structure in Figure 6 .1 of DMDMH that there is no empty nitrogen site for oxidative chlorine to bind, in practice some loss of formaldehyde occurs during the treatment process providing sites for chlorination with chlorine bleach. The DMDMH-treated fabrics exhibited rapid biocidal functions, but the washing durability of the functions requires improvement, due to the dominating imide N -halamine functionality, which is the most reactive, but least stable on the fabrics. However, DMDMH fabrics can be employed in personal protection against various biological agents such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, yeasts, and spores [3, 9] . Examples of the treated fabrics demonstrated a complete elimination of pathogens in a contact time as short as 2 min [2] [3] . The biocidal functions could be recharged repeatedly for at least 50 machine washes.",

It was observed that a complete 5.7 log reduction of S. aureus could be obtained in a contact-time interval of 30-60 min. Likewise, a complete 5.9 log reduction of E. coli was observed in a contact-time interval of 60-120 min. The chlorine loading on the cotton cloth was 0.5-0.6% by weight in these experiments. For comparison purposes, cotton cloth was also treated with the quaternary ammonium compound dimethyloctadecyltrimethoxysilylpropylammonium chloride. In this case the log reductions of S. aureus and E. coli were only 1.8 and 2.5, respectively, in This comparison demonstrates conclusively the superiority of cellulose treated with N -halamines over that treated with biocidal quaternary ammonium salts. The chlorinated SPH-treated cloth is reasonably stable to loss of chlorine during dry storage. A loss from 0.62% to 0.54% Cl was observed over a 50-day period for the treated cloth stored in a non-airtight plastic bag. In standard washing tests it was found that cotton cloth treated with SPH and chlorinated with an initial chlorine loading of 0.61% retained 0.42% Cl after 5 machine washings, 0.41% after 10 washings, and 0.10% after 50 washings; thus the material still retained some biocidal functionality even after 50 machine washings.",

The fabrics were dried at 50 \u2022 C for 5 min, cured at an elevated temperature for a specific period of time, and then washed with a large amount of distilled water, dried at 60 \u2022 C for 24 h, and stored in a conditioned room (25 \u2022 C, 65% RH) for 48 h to reach constant weight. The chemical reactions involved in this process are shown in Scheme 6.1 [11, 12] .",

The polymeric N -halamines could provide powerful and rapid antibacterial activities against E. coli and S. aureus. Most of the fibers could completely inactivate a large number of bacteria (1 \u00d7 10 6 CFU) in a 10-30 min contact time. In addition, the anti-bacterial activities of these polymeric Nhalamines could be easily recovered after usage by simply exposing to chlorine solution again. Figure 6 .3 reveals grafting yields on common fabrics using BPO as radical initiator and triallyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6(1H,3H,5H)-trione (TATAT) as a co-monomer in the grafting reactions [12] . These fabrics represent the most commonly employed fabric materials in institutional and consumer uses. The grafting reactions were almost quantitative for several fabrics. However, since BPO is very hydrophobic, it did not work as effectively on cotton fabrics as did hydrophilic radical initiators [12] . Table 6 .3 shows the durability of the biocidal functions provided by the ADMH grafted fabrics. The biocidal functions on most hydrophobic fabrics were more durable than those on hydrophilic fabrics and could last for more than 15 washes without recharging. After 50 washes, the lost biocidal functions were fully recharged by a dilute chlorine washing.",

The reaction on Nomex was especially highly efficient with the grafting yields above 4%. This result may be caused by lower crystallinity of the polymer than the other two since the reaction could only occur in amorphous areas of the polymers. Since these fabrics are quite hydrophobic, the adsorption of ADMH on the polymers was relatively difficult, which may contribute to overall lower grafting yields and low biocidal functions on Kermel and Kevlar/PBI fabrics.Hydrophobic properties may prevent hydrolysis of N -halamine structures on the fabrics.
