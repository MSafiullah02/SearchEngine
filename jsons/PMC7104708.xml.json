The horizontal route can include a large variety of environmental agents like aerosol spread, and food or water up-taking. Since it is assumed that most viruses are highly sensitive to desiccation [1], the ability of the virus to stand ambient conditions is a limiting factor for virus spread. In this respect, aspects like resistance to dehydration and virus spread through contaminated fomites, are important factors that affect the transmission of several viral human diseases [1\u20136]. Nevertheless, the molecular determinants by which viral structures resist desiccation remain unknown.",

Their structures show some common features: they are spherical structures of about 30 nm in diameter, built of 60 copies of four different peptides, and lack of an outer lipid bilayer envelope. These protein shells are compact with no obvious holes through which the internal solvent could be exchanged with that of the surrounding external milieu. However, the capsid presents cavities that traverse along the five-fold icosahedral axes. These cavities are constructed by an annulus formed by the five symmetry-related amino acid side chains, and this constriction is of about 0.4 nm in diameter. In many virus structures, an electron density is observed at this point, and has been interpreted as coordinated divalent cations that seem to block the cavity [10\u201313]. These metal ions are accessible from the external solvent and can be removed by chelating agents [10, 14, 15]. Although the putative function of these ions most likely relates to capsid stability, their structural role has not been experimentally determined yet.",

Together with these natural empty particles, two other empty particles can be obtained by experimental techniques [17]. These three empty particles were chemically characterized; their structures were solved at low resolution by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) reconstructions [18], and one of them at medium resolution by x-ray crystallography [19]. These studies allowed us to conclude that the three empty particles, and most likely the ones observed by direct TEM images taken from fresh feces, are almost identical to the atomic structure of full particles obtained by crystallography. Another conclusion was that the misprocessing of the precursor of the capsid proteins can produce different peptides, but even so they are able to assemble into spherical particles of the same diameter (~30 nm). However, these are unable to incorporate the viral RNA [17].",

This transmission mode implies that their viral capsids are strong enough to stand the harsh conditions they encounter through the digestive tract pathway of the insect. In the case of TrV, the virus may remain intact for years within infected dead insects [21], showing that the capsid resists the proteases and nucleases released by the decaying corpses. Additionally, both CrPV and TrV are shed in the insect\u2019s feces and represent a source of infection [22, 23]. Once the feces are deposited on the field or in insect nests, they are exposed to hot and dry ambient conditions (figure S1, supplemental information SI (stacks.iop.org/JPhysCM/30/104001/mmedia)). Although all these observations suggest that virus particles are able of surviving dry environments, little is known about how the lack of water affects the capsid structure.",

            "text": "Atomic force microscopy (AFM) provides both high-resolution images and physical properties of virus particles in liquid milieu [24]. AFM topographies allow for measuring the integrity of individual virus particles adsorbed on a solid substrate. Specifically, the particle dimensions (height and width) are an important indicator of the virus\u2019 structural integrity. This way, any structural change of the particle would result in a decrease of height [25], which may reflect either a structural collapse or just deformation. For instance, virus particles adsorbed on a surface in solution normally present a similar height to the nominal diameter obtained from the structural models [26\u201331]. Although it might depend on the virus\u2013surface interplay [32], the interaction between virus capsids and the surface is usually not strong enough to induce important alterations on their structure in liquid. However, the subsequent desiccation by removing the water from the surface modifies the virus structure, which renders a height considerably lower than the hydrated values [33]. This structural alteration of the virus is due to several mechanisms. First, the lack of water contributes to the destabilization of the native folding and association of capsid subunits [34]. Second, capillary forces occurring during the final desiccation steps pulls the virus structure toward the substrate [33]. Third, dehydration changes the genome folding and its interaction with the viral capsid. The magnitude of this structural change deeply depends on the presence of viral genome inside the viral cavity. For instance, phage phi29 exhibited disrupted structures keeping about 6% and 36% of the hydrated height for empty and dsDNA full particles, respectively. Furthermore, full virus particles expel their genome out of the capsid shell [33]. The capillary forces of the water menisci formed in the virus during the last stages of dehydration triggered these structural changes. Specifically, freeze drying of virus structures avoid menisci formation and reduce virus collapse during dehydration process [30]. These forces strongly depend on the existence of nanometric channels and pores at the virus shell that regulate the way that the water escapes from the virus [35].",

One striking point observed in both TrV and CrPV crystallographic structures is a bump of electron density that blocks the cavity that traverses the capsid along the five-fold symmetry axis (figure 1(B)). This sand clock-like cavity is formed by the arrangement of symmetry-related amino acid side chains, measuring ~0.5 nm in diameter at its narrowest region.",

The average yield per gram of dry feces of mTrV and Ecap was about 0.25 mg and 1.2 mg, respectively. When the starting material was the abdomen of dry insect corpses, the Ecap content with respect to mTrV was higher than that resulting from dry feces (Materials and Methods, MM). The diameter of both mTrV and Ecap particles as measured with dynamic light scattering (DLS) and as estimated from TEM experiments was about 30 nm. This value is coincident with the size determined from the crystallographic structure [13] and from cryo-TEM reconstructions [18] (figure 1(A)). After being treated with chelating agent, the samples of both particles did not experience any structural change, neither in height nor shape (SI figure S2).

AFM images do not show any indication of genome on the surface after desiccation (SI figure S4). In order to investigate the influence of the pore\u2019s character on the integrity of the TrV, we performed similar experiments with viral capsids treated with a chelating agent [36\u201339], as explained in MM. This treatment most likely removes the cation from each hydrophobic gate located at the five-fold symmetry axis [40]. The topographical profiles of the particles imaged in liquid milieu (figure 2(C)) show once more a height similar to the nominal diameter (blue, figure 2(G)). After desiccation, the chelated particle results again in a featureless structure (figure 2(D)). However, its profile (red, figure 2(G)) reaches higher values (~27 nm) than particles with ions still located at the hydrophobic gates. For the sake of comparison, figures 2(E) and (F) show examples of empty Ecap under liquid and dried conditions, whose profiles (figure 2(G)) show a dramatic collapse of the structure in air conditions.",

An ANOVA test between the two virus populations demonstrates a confidence p  <  0.05 that accounts for a significant difference (asterisks in figure 3). These results suggest that the ion observed in the five-fold symmetry axis plays an active role in the hydration of the virions. Besides height, AFM also provides the lateral dimensions of single TrV viruses (SI figure S5). These data indicate a certain propensity to flattening of virus particles upon desiccation, albeit with a high dispersion. Although this flattening is related to the deformation of particles during desiccation, we cannot neglect the inherent sample dilation originated by the lateral dimension of the tip [41].",

The main role these ions play in the capsid is structural, in the sense that they confer to the overall structure certain properties that are not associated with large changes in the protein fold. This can be illustrated by the fact that in both HRV14 and HRV16 the metal ions may play a role in viral disassembly, but no conformational changes are observed in the viral structures when the ions are removed [10]. In the case of TrV, it is also observed that the five-fold cavity of the virions capsid that contains the cations changes subtly changes in response to the capsid without cations [19]. It is obvious that in order for a cation to be part of a protein atomic structure, very stringent electronic conditions have to be fulfilled. However, if the protein structure is almost the same for both cavities (with and without ions), where does the structural difference reside? In light of our previous results modeling the solvation of the TrV capsid [40], the presence of the cation at the five-fold symmetry axis could determine the hydration of the cavity.",

TrV capsids demonstrate a similar behavior, and empty Ecap particles collapse dramatically after desiccation. In this case, we find that empty particles reduce their height to 9 nm, about 30% of the hydrated value (figure 3). However, mTrV capsids decrease their height to 84% of the hydrated value. This fact reveals that ssRNA in TrV, as dsDNA in other viruses, is an important contributor to keeping the virus structure under desiccation. In fact, the height of collapsed Ecap structures is very close to the thickness of two TrV capsid walls (~6 nn, figure 1(B)). However, the most striking feature we found is that, in contrast with other viruses such as phi29 bacteriophage or the Minute Virus of Mice [33], TrV capsids keep their genome inside after desiccation. This property seems quite adequate for TrV, which withstands stringent drying during long periods along its horizontal transmission, whereas feces dry in a few hours. If RNA leaves the capsid during dehydration, it seems very unlikely for it to be packed back in again without expressing new protein shells: this only happens in the cell environment. Consequently, for viruses transmitted through the fecal\u2013oral route, retaining the genome inside the capsid during ambient exposure might constitute a necessary condition to complete the infection cycle.",

Nevertheless, one of the necessary features that permit the horizontal transmission of the virus in dry natural environments may be that the TrV capsid maintains its genome under stringent dehydration conditions. This feature could affect the recovery of TrV structural and infectious characteristics under proper hydration conditions, either in feces or the insect digestive tract. Therefore, a challenging experiment consists of characterizing the capsid structures with AFM after rehydrating the dried viruses adsorbed on the surface. Figure S6 (SI) presents an example of such experiment, showing a very inhomogeneous sample of unidentified specimens where it is difficult to separate virus particles from debris. We think that our experiment is probably not mimicking the natural rehydration conditions, and more effort should be invested in addressing this issue. We speculate that TrV being capable of keeping RNA inside under dehydrated ambient conditions is the result of evolutionary adaptation of this and other similar viruses to favor horizontal transmission.",

            "text": "Since the cavity along the five-fold icosahedral axis has a small neck, this structural feature can be considered as a barrier for the solvent to freely permeate the capsid shell. In fact, simulation studies of narrow cavities in membrane protein structures coin the concept of the \u2018hydrophobic gate\u2019 [44\u201346]. Meanwhile, calculations show that the water density within cylindrical cavities with a diameter below 0.7 nm can be described as in a liquid\u2013vapor transition [47]. This behavior depends on the pore diameter and hydrophobic/hydrophilic character of the amino acid lining the cavity. More recent experimental studies done in non-biological nanopores gave direct evidence of hydrophobic gating modulated by applying a voltage across the pore [48]. Our previous simulation of the TrV capsid [40] found that the hydrophobic barrier is removed if the divalent cation is placed in a point in the cavity that crystallographic studies assign to a coordinated ion [13]. When the ion is present, the cavity is fully hydrated and water molecules enter the hydrophobic neck, forming a line [40]. Due to the key role water molecules play in biological systems, the conduction of solvent and ions through proteins attracts the interest of both theoretical and experimental studies. In particular, the aquaporin family of water pores provides a remarkable example of water conduction through long (ca. 2 nm) and narrow (about 0.3 nm) means of traversing a protein body [45, 49, 50]. Since virus wall is the border of the virion with the external environment, its structure and porosity determine the release of water during desiccation [35]. In this respect, the hydrophobic character of the 12 transversal channels at the pentons of TrV capsid seems to influence the structure of virus particles after desiccation. Chelated particles, where the divalent ion has been removed from the channels, keep about 90% of the hydrated height (figure 3). However, the presence of divalent cations in TrV particles preserves about the 84% of the hydrated height (figure 3). When the hydrophobic character of the channels is active (chelated particles), virus capsids exhibit a larger height. We interpret that the hydrophilic character of these channels favors the water to escape from the virus cavity, removing water from the RNA.",

We suggest that the hydrated nucleic acids prevent virus deformation more efficiently than a dehydrated genome because the presence of water stabilizes the RNA\u2019s folding and structure [51\u201354]. It is important to remark that both chelated and non-chelated particles do not result in collapse, but deformed structures after dehydration. However, according to figure S5, mTrV particles show higher deformation because their full width at half maximum (FWHM) is larger than that of the chelated mTrV. The ions\u2019 role of facilitating water escape contrasts with the intuitive thinking that the presence of ions should block the viral cavity. The presence or absence of ions might be useful in a natural environment in two ways. It is important to shuttle the water in and out to, on one hand, maximize virus stability during dry conditions and, on the other hand, allow hydration when needed for activating the virus for infection again.",

Cantilevers were routinely calibrated using Sader\u2019s method [56]. AFM imaging was performed at 70 pN to explore the viruses on the surface in liquid. In air, we used the non-contact dynamic mode [57].",
