Some viruses also have an outer lipid bilayer membrane external to the coat, called an envelope. The nucleic acid codes for enzymes involved in replication and for several structural proteins and their replication depends on the host-cell biosynthetic machinery. Thus, one of the challenges in the development of antiviral agents is the identification of the steps in viral replication that are unique to the virus and not used by the normal cell. Among the unique viral events are attachment, penetration, uncoating, RNA-directed DNA synthesis (reverse transcription) or RNA-directed RNA synthesis (RNA viruses), and assembly and release of the intact virion. For example, assembly of some virus particles requires a unique viral enzyme, protease, and this has led to the development of protease inhibitors. Moreover, each virus has specific functions, making the development of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs difficult. In some cases, antiviral agents do not selectively inhibit a unique replicative event but inhibit DNA polymerase. Inhibitors of this enzyme take advantage of the fact that the virus is synthesizing nucleic acids more rapidly than the cell; therefore, there is relatively greater inhibition of viral than cellular DNA. Further, antiviral agents developed against the viruses that cause permanent infections such as HSV and HIV, exert their antiviral effect in the acute disease but have no effects on viruses in latency resulting in chronic infections with periods of virus reactivation and recurrence of the disease requiring long-time treatment.",

This interaction requires an adequate contact between the virus and the cell. However, only a small percentage of the direct contact between a virus and a host cell lead to a successful infection because adsorption is a highly specific reaction that involves attachment of the surface viral proteins, or spikes, and corresponding receptors on the surface of the host cell. Receptors for human viruses are mostly glycoproteins present in the plasma membrane that have the role in cell signaling and in many reactions of the immune system. Thus, any attempts to design antiviral agents that block the binding to the receptors for a long time must consider the possibility that the loss of the normal cellular function associated with the receptors would have serious consequences for the host organism. Some viruses for adsorption to the cells use different surface molecules, called coreceptors. It was originally thought that CD4 is the unique receptor for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), but later coreceptors that normally function as chemokine receptors (CCR5 and CXCR4) were discovered. In some cases, capsid protein have the role in the adhesion to the cells.",

            "text": "Enveloped human viruses use two basic mechanisms for entry into the cell. Both mechanisms involve fusion of the viral envelope with a cellular membrane, resulting in both cases in the release of the free nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm. Paramyxoviruses, some of the retroviruses (HIV-1), and herpesviruses enter the cell by the process called direct fusion. In direct fusion, the spikes present in the envelopes of the viruses promote fusion of the viral membrane with the plasma membrane of the cell, resulting in the release of the nucleocapsid directly into the cytoplasm. Due to the fact that the viral envelope becomes incorporated into the plasma membrane of the infected cell and still expresses its fusion proteins, infected cells have a tendency to fuse with other uninfected cells. Most of the remaining enveloped animal viruses, such as orthomyxoviruses (influenza viruses), togaviruses (rubella virus), rhabdoviruses (rabies), and coronaviruses enter the cell by a cellular mechanism called receptor-mediated endocytosis, or viropexis. In viropexis, viruses adsorb the cell through multiple interactions of virus attachment proteins and host cell molecules and thus facilitate the plasma membrane surrounding the host cell molecules. Pinching off of the cellular membrane by fusion encloses the virion in a cytoplasmic (endosomal vesicle) that is acidified by a normal cellular process. In the endosomal vesicle, the nucleocapsid is surrounded by two membranes: the viral envelope and the newly acquired endosomal membrane. The low pH of the endosome leads to a conformational change in a viral spike protein, resulting in the fusion of these two membranes and release of the nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm.",

            "text": "The key step in every viral infection is the production of virus-specific mRNAs that direct the synthesis of the viral proteins, structural proteins of the virion and enzymes and other specialized proteins required for genome replication, gene expression, and virus assembly and release. Viral mRNAs of most DNA viruses are synthesized by the host DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RNA polymerase II). The (single)strand RNA viruses, (the picornaviruses, the togaviruses, and the coronaviruses) possess positive single-stranded RNA that can be used directly as mRNAs in the process of translation immediately after their entry into the cytoplasm of the cell. One of these viral proteins is RNA dependent RNA polymerase required for synthesis of the new mRNA, since there is no cellular machinery that can use either single-or double-stranded RNA as a template to synthesize mRNA. Therefore, poxviruses and viruses that use an RNA template to make mRNAs must provide their own transcription machinery to produce the viral mRNAs at the beginning of the infection process. At later times in the course of the infection, any special enzymatic machinery that the virus requires but is not present initially in the cell can be obtained among the proteins translated from the mRNA molecules. The parvoviruses have single-stranded DNA genomes, and RNA polymerase of the cell requires double-stranded DNA as a template, but these viruses do not need to carry special enzymes in their virions because host cell DNA polymerases can convert the genomes into double-stranded DNA. However, the production of more mRNA of the picornaviruses requires the synthesis of an intermediate negative-strand RNA template that requires the translation and production of the enzyme called RNA-dependent RNA polymerase early in the course of infection. The retroviruses are a special form of positive singlestranded RNA viruses. Although the genomes of retroviruses are the same polarity as mRNA and could serve as mRNAs early after infection, the RNA genomes of these viruses are copied into negative DNA strands by reverse transcriptase, an enzyme that is always present inside the virion. The newly synthesized negative DNA strands are subsequently converted by the same enzyme to double-stranded DNA, which is accompanied with the degradation of the original genomic RNA by the RNase H activity of the reverse transcriptase. The DNA made by the activity of reverse transcriptase is integrated into the host cell DNA and transcribed by the host RNA polymerase in order to complete the replication cycle and to produce viral mRNA. The replication of the hepatitis B DNA genome is mechanistically similar to the replication process of a retrovirus. In the case of the hepatitis B virus, viral DNA is the template for the process of transcription and production of a single-stranded RNA, which in turn is reverse transcribed to produce the progeny viral DNA that becomes a part of the new virions.",

            "text": "Enzymes and accessory proteins required for the replication of DNA, are in the eukaryotic cells present only during the S phase of the cell cycle, and are located only in the nucleus. The extent to which viruses use the cell replication machinery depends on their protein-coding potential and, thus, on the size of their genome. The smallest of the DNA viruses, the parvoviruses, are completely dependent on host machinery, meaning that they can replicate only in the dividing cells. When the normal S phase of the cell cycle occurs, viral DNA replicates together with the cellular DNA. Large DNA viruses are relatively independent of cellular functions, they replicate in the cytoplasm and code for almost all the enzymes and other proteins required for replicating their DNA. The remainder of the DNA viruses is only partially dependent on host machinery. The small DNA human viruses, such as the polyomaviruses and papillomaviruses code for a protein that is involved in the initiation of synthesis at the origin, but the host machinery accomplishes the remainder of the replication process. To some extent, more complex adenoviruses and herpesviruses, in addition to providing originspecific proteins, also encode for their own DNA polymerases and other accessory proteins required for DNA replication. The fact that the herpesviruses encode for their own DNA polymerase is the key point exploited for the creation of antiviral therapeutics. Certain antiviral drugs such as acyclovir (acycloguanosine) preferentially kills cells infected with herpes viruses because the viral thymidine kinase, unlike the cellular counterpart, phosphorylate the nucleoside analog. Phosphorylated nucleoside analogue inhibits further DNA synthesis when DNA polymerases incorporate it into DNA. The host cell enzyme discriminates better host nucleosides and the acyclovir analog fails to phosphorylate acyclovir analogue and inhibition of synthesis of cellular DNA fails. Accordingly, acyclovir does not kill uninfected cells. A similar principle applies to the chainterminating drugs such as zidovudine and dideoxyinosine that are phosphorylated by cellular kinase and target not only the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase but also inhibit cellular DNA polymerase to some extent.",

Moreover, cells do not have RNA polymerases, enzymes necessary for the copy of RNA templates (RNA-based RNA transcription or replication). Accordingly, RNA viruses not only need to encode for transcriptases or polymerases (required for transcription), but also must provide the polymerases required to duplicate the RNA genome into daughter RNA genomes. Furthermore, except in the cases of the picornaviruses, in which transcription and replication are synonymous, the RNA viruses must temporally and functionally separate transcription from replication. After replication begins, these same templates are used to synthesize full-length strands for replication. There are two mechanisms that separate the process of transcription from replication: (1) in some cases, transcription is restricted to subviral particles and utilizes a transcriptase transported into the cell within the virion; (2) in other cases, the replication process either involves a functionally distinct RNA polymerase or depends on the presence of some other accessory protein specific for the virus that directs the synthesis of full-length copies of the template.",

This process will slowly use up the cell membrane and eventually lead to the demise of the cell. This is also how antiviral responses are able to detect virus-infected cells. Virus infected animal cells are programmed to autodestruction. Besides, viruses could also have the role in forcing the cell to undergo apoptosis, and thus release of progeny into the extracellular space is possible. Viruses, mostly nonenveloped, leave cells through exocytosis.

Since acyclovir cannot be phosphorylated and activated in an uninfected host cell, this drug is essentially nontoxic. Viral thymidine kinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of acyclovir only to a monophosphate, whereas host-cell enzymes continues the phosphorilation to the diphosphate and, finally, the triphosphate. Acyclovir triphosphate competes with guanosine triphosphate, inhibits the function of the virally encoded DNA polymerase, and finally inhibits viral replication. The selectivity and minimal toxicity of acyclovir is due to its 100-fold or greater affinity for viral DNA polymerase than for cellular DNA polymerase. A second mechanism of viral inhibition comes from incorporation of acyclovir triphosphate into the growing viral DNA chain. There is no 3\u2032-hydroxy group on the acyclovir to serve as the attachment sites for additional nucleotides, thus the result of acyclovir incorporation is the termination of chain growth. Activity of acyclovir against herpes viruses directly correlates with the capacity of the virus to induce a thymidine kinase. Susceptible strains of herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and -2) contain the most active thymidine kinases and are the most readily inhibited by acyclovir. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) induces little or no phosphorilation of acyclovir and is not inhibited by this drug. Varicella-Zoster and Epstein-Barr viruses are between these two extremes in terms of both thymidine kinase induction and susceptibility to acyclovir. Resistant strains of HSV have been recovered from immunodeficient patients, including patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) but rarely from immunocompetent patients, even after years of drug exposure. In most cases, resistance was the result of mutations in the viral thymidine kinase gene, that make it inactive in phosphorylation. Resistance may also result from mutations in the viral DNA polymerase. Acyclovir is available in three application forms: topical, oral, and parenteral. The oral form has low bioavailability, but achieves concentrations in blood that inhibit HSV and, to a lesser extent, Varicella-Zoster virus (VZV). Intravenous acyclovir is used for serious HSV infection (congenital infections, encephalitis) as well as for VZV infection in immunocompromised patients. The dosage of acyclovir must be reduced in patients with renal failure, given the fact that acyclovir is excreted by the kidney. Central nervous system toxicity and renal toxicity have been reported in patients treated with prolonged high intravenous doses. Acyclovir does not induce bone marrow toxicity, even in patients with hematopoietic disorders. Acyclovir is effective in the treatment of primary HSV mucocutaneous infections or for severe recurrences in immunocompromised patients. The agent is useful in neonatal herpes and encephalitis, infection in immunocompromised patients and for varicella in older children or adults. Acyclovir is beneficial against herpes zoster in elderly patients or any patient with eye infections. In patients with frequent severe genital herpes, the oral form is effective in preventing recurrences, but it has minimal efficiency in the treatment of recurrent genital or labial herpes in otherwise healthy persons.",

Acyclovir has low activity against CMV because CMV does not carry the gene for thymidine kinase and adequate phosphorylation of acyclovir in CMV-infected cells lacks. However, ganciclovir is active against CMV because it does not require thymidine kinase for phosphorylation. Rather, another phosphorylating enzyme (UL97) encoded by the viral genome is present in CMV-infected cells that is capable of phosphorylating ganciclovir and converting it to the monophosphate. Later, cellular enzymes convert it to the active compound ganciclovir triphosphate, which inhibits the viral DNA polymerase. Oral ganciclovir is available but is inferior to the intravenous form. Oral valganciclovir, a prodrug of ganciclovir, has improved bioavailability and is equivalent to the intravenous form. Toxicity, especially neutropenia, frequently limits therapy. Thrombocytopenia occurs in approximately 15% of patients. Ganciclovir or valganciclovir are indicated for the prevention or treatment of active CMV infection in immunodeficient patients, but other herpesviruses (particularly HSV-1, HSV-2, and VZV) are also susceptible. After several months of continuous ganciclovir therapy used for control of CMV infection, between 5% and 10% of patients with AIDS excrete resistant strains of CMV. In almost all isolates, a mutation is found in the phosphorylating gene (UL97), and in a lesser number a mutation may also be found in the viral DNA polymerase.

Ribavirin is active against a broad range of viruses in vitro, but its in vivo activity is limited. The mechanism of the antiviral effect of ribavirin is not clear as it is in the case of acyclovir. Ribavirin inhibits RNA polymerase, and also inhibits inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, an enzyme important in the synthetic pathway of guanosine. Further, because of interference with both guanylation and methylation of the nucleic acid, ribavirin decrease synthesis of the mRNA 5\u2032 cap.

Liposomes are spherical vesicular systems consisting of at least one lipid bilayer. Lipid layers are mostly natural or synthetic phospholipids, most often, phosphatidylcholine. Inside the lipid layer is an aqueous core. The main types of liposomes are small unilamellar vesicles, large unilamellar vesicles, and multilamellar vesicles. Depending on the method used for their preparation, the liposomes vary in size from 40 nm to 10 \u00b5m. Hydrophilic therapeutics can be incorporated in liposomes inside the aqueous core, whereas lipophilic therapeutics can be inserted in a lipid. The efficiency of incorporation of therapeutics in liposomes depends on the size of the liposome, the hydrophobicity of the charge of its surface, and membrane fluidity. These characteristics of liposomes also influence in vitro stability, and biodistribution of applied therapeutics. The phagocitic cells in the spleen rapidly recognize liposomes after their intravenous application and internalize them. The reduction of engulfment of liposomes by the phagocytes is achieved by chemical modification of liposomes with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) units. However the surface of liposomes can be modified in such a way as to increase their recognition, and subsequently the endocytosis by macrophages and other cells of the innate immune system. Since HIV resides in macrophages, liposomes have been mainly studied as carriers for anti-HIV drugs, deliveries of HIV vaccines, as well as siRNA. There are also certain disadvantages of these carriers of viral agents, such as poor stability in vitro, as well as in vivo, low efficiency of their incorporation in lipid bilayers or aqueous core, and very high cost of their production. The liposomal delivery system has been constructed for acyclovir for the local treatment of genital herpes and recurrent genital herpes. Liposomes were also used as the carrier for the topical application of acyclovir and also for the antisense oligonucleotides for the intravitreal administration for the treatment of ocular CMV infections.

The core of the micelle is formed by the hydrophobic fragments of amphiphilic molecules, whereas micelle's shell consists of hydrophilic fragments of micellar molecules. Micellar amphiphilic molecules at low concentrations exist separately in aqueous medium. The aggregation of micellar molecules takes place if their concentration is increased. But aggregation of micellar molecules happens only within a limited concentration interval.

The first strategy is based on usage of monoclonal antibodies specific for antigens expressed on certain cells or tissues. The other strategy used to target precise tissues or intracellular compartments is the usage of stimulisensitive nanocarriers. These stimuli-sensitive nanocarriers can be sensitive to inherent stimuli of the pathological site or intracellular organelles, such as abnormal temperature values, or pH value, or can be sensitive to externally applied stimuli, for example, magnetic field, temperature, or ultrasound. All these internal and external stimuli affect nanoparticles, dissolve or modify them, or guide the sensitive nanocarriers, and the final result is the release of the carried drug in a precise region. The great interest in the field of therapeutic applications is for pHsensitive nanocarriers due to the fact that enveloped viruses in the acidic environment of the endosomal lumen reject their envelope and thus infect the cell. Liposomes, nanogels, and polymeric micelles are some of the pH-sensitive carriers that can promote the intracellular release of the encapsulated drug when the pH changes. These pH-sensitive carriers are stable at physiological pH level, but in an acidic environment, such as a lysosomal environment, become unstable and release their aqueous content in the intracellular space. Labeled nanocarriers can be guided by the external stimuli, for example, by a magnetic field, or by the application of a certain temperature or ultrasound. In the case of magnetic drug delivery, the external magnetic stimulus guides the microparticles with encapsulated drug to the specified tissue, inducing the accumulation of the carrier in the target organ. However, the release of the drug from its carrier is the passive process and depends on the properties of the microparticle system. On the other hand, usage of ultrasound as external stimuli allows the activation of the release of the drug at the site of action.",

However, the most drastic effect of HIV infection is the result of the destruction of the CD4 + T lymphocytes, which play a central role in the capacity of the host to mount effective and protective immune responses to a wide range of infective agents. HIV infection is characterized with an acute phase of intense viral replication and dissemination to lymphoid tissues manifested with flu-or mononucleosis-like illness. That is followed with activation of innate and adaptive immune response unable to clear the highly replicating and mutating virus; slow viral replication and immune activation is continued (chronic [persistent] asymptomatic phase, clinical latency) and final stage of the infection, immunodeficiency (AIDS) with opportunistic infections is the result of marked depletion of CD4 + T lymphocytes. HIV is an enveloped virus, 100 nm in diameter, contains two copies of RNA coated with the nucleocapsid protein, the RNA-protein complexes are enclosed in a capsid (called p24), which is covered by a membrane-associated matrix (called p17) protein. The viral envelope contains two, virally encoded, glycoproteins gp120 and gp41. The virion core also contains three virus-specific nonstructural proteins (enzymes) that are essential for viral replication: reverse transcriptase, protease, and integrase. Gp120 is needed to attach to the host cell, while gp41 is critical for the cell fusion process. HIV adheres to the cells that express the CD4 molecule, and the gp120 molecule binds CD4 molecules resulting in the conformational change of the gp120. After conformational change, gp120 binds the second cellular molecule, chemokine receptors CCR5 or CXCR4, known as coreceptors. The next event is the conformational change of gp41 that enables fusion of the membranes and delivery of the capside to the cytoplasm. Virionassociated RNA-dependent DNA polymerase, reverse transcriptase, mediates the reverse transcription of RNA into complementary DNA. DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity of the same reverse transcriptase enzyme mediates the conversion of this complementary DNA to a double-stranded DNA. The viral RNA template is removed from the RNA-DNA hybrid by RNAase H activity of the same reverse transcriptase enzyme. The newly synthesized DNA integrates into the cellular genome and later is transcribed into the full-length viral RNA and also into the number of spliced mRNA transcripts. The process of the transcription of the viral DNA and translation is mediated by the cellular enzymes. The synthesized viral proteins together with the newly transcribed viral RNA are transported to the cell membrane, where assembly of the virus particle takes place and the virus buds from the cellular surface and exits into the extracellular space.",

The size of these particles was 250 nm and analysis showed that this carrier significantly increased the delivery of efavirenz into several tissues compared with free drug. Another approach involves viral DNA that codes gag and env viral glycoproteins adsorbed on the surface of cationic poly(lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticles in order to induce adequate immune response to HIV antigens. The polimeric nanoparticle and the viral DNA together form a pathogen-like nanoparticle, known as Derma-Vir. Sugar residues that have the role in the uptake by antigen-presenting cells are present at the surface of the DermaVir nanoparticles. The role of nanoparticule polymer inside the cell is to protect the viral DNA from endosomal degradation and to facilitate the delivery of these DNA into the nucleus, which is required for the expression of DNA-encoded antigens. It was shown that gold nanoparticles also could have the role in the inhibition HIV fusion with host cells. However, the usage of gold nanoparticles is followed with toxic side effects that are related to size, shape, charge, composition, and surface functionality of the nanoparticles. Appropriate surface coating, which also enables better selective targeting and internalization can achieve the significant reduction of gold nanoparticles toxicity. The advantage of the nanostructure constructs is the transformation of biologically inactive molecules into a multivalent conjugate enable to effectively inhibit fusion of HIV envelope and human cells. CCR5 antagonist, SDC-1721, is unable to bind the receptor with high affinity, but its conjugation with gold nanoparticles in multivalent manner transform biologically inactive SDC-1721 into therapeutically active molecule and allow effective HIV-fusion inhibition. Also, the DC-SIGN-mediated HIV transinfection of human T lymphocytes can be prevented with gold nanoparticles coated with oligomannoses from the gp120 molecule. It was shown recently that carbon nanotubes have advantages over other nanoparticles. Carbon nanotubes are able to cross cell membranes and deliver therapeutics into various types of cells. Carboxyl groups in nanotubes allow prolonged contact of therapeutic with its target molecule through promotion of electrostatic and hydrogen bond interactions with the amino acid residues of reverse transcriptase.

Now it is considered that well-conserved receptors and coreceptors present on the host cells are more promising targets for therapeutics that can efficiently prevent HCV infection independently on the virus genotype. The examples of these target molecules are CD81, SR-B1, and claudin 1. Usage of small compounds that target glycoproteins in the HCV envelope and thus block viral entry is genotype-specific. Usage of nanostructures could be an alternative approach in the therapy of HCV infections. The potential of lipid nanosomes and cationic liposomes with incorporated siRNA to inhibit expression of HCV gene have been proven in vivo. It was shown that the alternative therapy for PEGylated IFN-\u03b1 can be a target-specific hyaluronic acid interferon-\u03b1 gold conjugate. The hyaluronic acid interferon-\u03b1 gold conjugate significantly enhances the expression of 2,5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 in the liver tissue. It is known that 2,5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 has a role in the innate immunity to viral infection; it has RNAse activity. Dextran-coated magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles conjugated to a synthetic DNAzyme, induce knockdown of the HCV gene, which encodes helicase and protease essential for the virus replication. These dextrancoated magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles accumulate primarily in the liver and have a great potential for application of anti-HCV drugs. Recently, it has been shown that boronic-acid modified nanostructures inhibit entry of HCV into hepatocytes. Among the molecules reported to inhibit HCV entry in hepatocytes are various glycan-recognizing proteins, lectins. Lectins selectively interact with glycans present on the surface of the viruses. It was shown that lectins, cyanovirin-N, and griffithsin have the great potential to interact with high-mannose glycoproteins on the surface of HCV envelope reducing the contact of viruses with host cells and the entry of HCV into the cells. So-called pseudolectins, such as boronic acid-based compounds, are much simpler structures than natural lectins and are more accessible synthetically. There are many advantages of boronic acid-based pseudo-lectins over their natural counterparts: their interactions are more stable, they are less expensive to produce and purify, and they do not exert mitogenic stimulation. The affinity of the lectins for appropriate glycan significantly increases when multiple copies of these synthetic lectins (e.g., boronic acid derivative) are attached onto polymeric nanoparticle. Besides boronic acid based pseudolectins, many other pseudo-lectins have been investigated as possible therapeutics for HCV including silica-, diamond-, and iron-, derived nanoparticles. However, these nanostructures have moderate maximal inhibition potential, which is the major obstacle for their further development as inhibitors of viral entry. More powerful inhibitors of HCV entry are amphiphilic boronic acid moieties inserted in the lipid nanocapsules.",

            "text": "Herpes simplex viruses are ubiquitous and have existed throughout human history. After the initial lytic infection, latent infection is established. Latent infection persists for the life of the host. There are two types of HSV, type 1 and type 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) and they both infect around 60%-90% of adults worldwide. HSV-1 is mainly associated with infections of the face and central nervous system, while HSV-2 mainly causes infections of the anogenital area. Infections with HSV-1 in immunodeficient persons can be life threatening. HSV is an enveloped virus that has a central core with the linear double-stranded DNA. There are 11-12 viral glycoproteins in the HSV lipid bilayer envelope. The entry of HSV entry into the host cells is the most critical step in pathogeneses of viral disease and depends on the binding at least five glycoproteins of viral envelop to three different receptors on the membrane of the host cell (nectin-1, nectin-2, herpes virus entry mediator, and cell surface glycosaminoglycans, preferentially heparan sulfate). The important step in the HSV attachment to the cell is irreversible binding of two viral glycoproteins with cellular heparan sulfate. Drastic reduction in susceptibility to HSV infections is noticed in cells deficient in heparan sulfate indicating that heparin can be a highly attractive target for nanoparticles conjugated with antiheparan sulfate peptide. The viral DNA replication is mediated by viral DNA polymerase. Most drugs used for therapy of HSV infections target the viral DNA polymerase. A guanosine analogue, acyclovir, is the most important clinical drug for the prophylaxis and treatment of HSV infections. Although acyclovir is considered gold standard in therapy of HSV infections, its extensive use has led to the emergence of acyclovir resistant HSV strains, mostly in immunodeficient persons. This caused the intensive search for alternative drugs, and for alternative therapies that block with viral attachment to the host cells at different levels. Recently, it was shown that only a few structures have anti-HSV activity; gold and silver nanoparticles with sulfonate functions, inhibited the viral entry and prevented the viral spreading from cell to cell. Gold nanoparticles with the mercaptoethanesulfonate 4 nm in size imitate heparan sulfate present on the host cell and thereby block HSV attachment to the cell and inhibit viral entry. It was reported that partially negatively charged ZnO micro-nanostructures (MNSs) arrest HSV-1 in vitro. Gold nanoparticles conjugated with tannic acid reduce HSV-2 infectivity in vitro and in vivo, due to the high affinity interaction of tannins with HSV glycoproteins that prevents the attachment and entry of HSV in the susceptible cells. Since the HSV glycoprotein spikes has an average space of 9-13 nm between center-tocenter, tannic acid-modified gold nanoparticles with diameter of 33 nm had the best antiviral effect. Since, therapeutics used for the treatment of HSV infections-acyclovir, peniclovir, and oxyresveratrol-have the slow absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and consecutively low oral bioavailability, new approaches consider usage of polymeric nanoparticles with encapsulated conventional antiviral drugs. Polycaprolactone matrices and 400 nm spherical carboxylated cyclodextrin-based nanosponges containing acyclovir showed better efficiency against a clinical isolate of HSV. Microemulsions with introduced acyclovir could be used as more effective topical preparations. Also, microemulsion-based topical formulations with introduced penciclovir showed increased penetration of penciclovir through mouse skins. Idoxuridine with liposomal carriers also showed increased retention of idoxuridine in the skin compared with classic preparation. In mice it was shown that intravaginal administration of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid nanoparticles with encapsulating siRNA that knock-down the host-cell protein nectin effectively prevents genital HSV-2 infection.",
