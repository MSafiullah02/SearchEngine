Nevertheless, RNA viruses play a prominent role in our understanding of life's origin and evolution. Because RNA is widely believed to predate DNA as the genetic material, RNA viruses could be living fossils of the primordial RNA world (Joyce, 2002, Koonin and Martin, 2005). Therefore, at least some genes of RNA viruses are likely to encode extremely ancient, perhaps, primeval proteins involved in replication and metabolism of nucleic acids. From a somewhat different, comparative-genomic perspective, large RNA viruses provide an opportunity to investigate problems of genome complexity and its evolution on a relatively modest, tractable scale.",

However, closteroviruses stand alone in regard to their genetic capacity and variability, as well as the unique morphology of their particles. It is instructive to compare the genera Closterovirus and Tobamovirus that both belong to the alphavirus-like superfamily and share the helical virion architecture (Fig. 1\n). All tobamoviruses have \u223c6.5 kb genomes that code for four proteins, one of which assembles to form the rod-shaped virion (Fig. 1B and C). In contrast, the size of closterovirus genomes varies from \u223c15.5 to \u223c19.5 kb with a coding capacity of 10\u201314 proteins (Fig. 1, Fig. 2\n). Filamentous virions of closteroviruses incorporate at least five proteins that are assembled into a long body of uniform morphology and a short segmented tail (Fig. 1C). Thus, the larger amount of genetic material in closteroviruses translates into the increased structural complexity and genetic variation among individual viruses.",

The product of the 5\u2032-terminal open reading frame (ORF) contains RNA methyltransferase (MET) and RNA helicase (HEL) domains. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (POL) is encoded by a downstream ORF that is presumably expressed via a +1 translational frameshift (Agranovsky et al., 1994, Karasev et al., 1995). Thus, translation of the genomic RNA results in two large polyproteins, one spanning MET\u2013HEL, and the other one encompassing MET\u2013HEL\u2013POL; this second, larger polyprotein is produced in much smaller quantities due to the low frequency of frameshifting. The MET\u2013HEL\u2013POL module of closteroviruses is universally conserved in the entire alphavirus-like superfamily (Fig. 1A and B) (Koonin and Dolja, 1993).",

This shell is enveloped by a membrane derived from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or other endomembrane. In accord with this paradigm, we found that closterovirus infection results in a drastic remodeling of the ER network that is transformed into a large vesicular factory of viral RNA. We also found that transient expression of the MET\u2013HEL polyprotein alone is sufficient to restructure ER (Prokhnevsky et al., unpublished data). As proposed by Schwartz et al. (2002), one or a few POL-containing replication complexes are present within each virus-induced vesicle to amplify the viral genome and to produce subgenomic messenger RNA (sgRNAs).",

The papain-like proteases of alphaviruses, rubiviruses, or tymoviruses are located between the replicase domains and are responsible for multiple processing events within the polyprotein (Dougherty and Semler, 1993).

When expressed together, L1 and L2 act synergistically to provide for even higher levels of viral RNA.

Usually, these sgRNAs are functionally monocistronic, each expressing only one protein from the 5\u2032-proximal ORF. While many diverse positive-strand viruses produce from one to three subgenomic sgRNAs (Miller and Koev, 2000), nidoviruses make up to 9, and closteroviruses up to 10 sgRNAs. Although the details of transcription mechanisms may vary among the viruses of the order Nidovirales, they share certain important features (Gorbalenya et al., 2006). The short, AU-rich, transcription-regulating sequences (TRS) are present upstream from the 5\u2032-terminal and all internal ORFs. The TRSs are thought to mediate termination of the minus-strand synthesis to produce templates for the positive-strand sgRNAs. In arteriviruses and coronaviruses, termination at the TRS of each internal ORF is followed by the template \u2018jumping\u2019 such that transcription complex lands to 5\u2032-proximal TRS and copies the part of the 5\u2032-leader region. This discontinuous transcription mode resulting in a mosaic structure of the sgRNAs is a unique and remarkable feature of the nidovirus genome expression mechanism (Gorbalenya et al., 2006, Pasternak et al., 2001, Sawicki et al., 2001, Zuniga et al., 2004).",

It is not known if, similar to smaller alpha-like viruses, closteroviral sgRNA synthesis involves internal initiation using genome-size, negative-strand template (Miller and Koev, 2000). In fact, occurrence of the minus strands of sgRNAs in closterovirus-infected cells (Dolja et al., 1990, Hilf et al., 1995) is better compatible with the nidovirus-like, minus-strand termination model. Additional support for this model comes from extensive analysis of the CTV-specific RNA species. It was found that the controller elements located upstream from each internal CTV ORF direct formation of not only the positive and negative strands of sgRNAs, but also a set of the 5\u2032-coterminal positive-strand RNAs of subgenomic size (Gowda et al., 2001). These latter RNAs terminate at variable positions upstream of the initiation site of the corresponding sgRNAs. The simplest reconciliation of these data is that the sgRNA controller elements, which contain hairpin structures, act as terminators during transcription of both positive, and negative strands of the viral RNA. Although there were no reports of two distinct sets of subgenomic RNAs in nidoviruses, this issue seems to deserve more experimental scrutiny.",

These elements function efficiently in a heterologous genetic background, i.e., they are recognized by heterologous replicases (Peremyslov et al., 1999). The structural variability of the sgRNA controllers seems to contribute to the regulation of the level and timing of viral gene expression (Hagiwara et al., 1999, Hilf et al., 1995). On the more practical side, the promiscuity of the RNA replicases toward sgRNA controllers facilitates utilization of closteroviruses as versatile gene expression vectors. These vectors can accommodate multiple expression cassettes and efficiently produce reporters or other beneficial proteins in the infected plants (Peremyslov and Dolja, unpublished data).",

CPm is paralogous to CP and functions as a principal component of the short virion tail (Agranovsky et al., 1995, Tian et al., 1999). In addition to CPm, the tail assembly requires Hsp70h and p60, each of which is also an integral, although a minor tail component (Alzhanova et al., 2001, Napuli et al., 2000, Napuli et al., 2003, Peremyslov et al., 2004a, Satyanarayana et al., 2000, Satyanarayana et al., 2004). Similar to cellular molecular chaperones of Hsp70 family, closteroviral Hsp70h possess a highly conserved, N-terminal, ATPase domain and a less conserved C-terminal domain (Agranovsky et al., 1991, Bork et al., 1992). Extensive mutation analysis revealed that each of these domains is intimately involved in the virion assembly (Alzhanova et al., 2001; Prokhnevsky et al., unpublished data). It was also found that p60 possess the CP-like, virion-embedded, C-terminal domain, and the N-terminal domain, which is exposed at the virion's surface (Napuli et al., 2003). Hsp70h and p60 act cooperatively to facilitate incorporation of CPm and to define the proper tail length (Satyanarayana et al., 2004; Alzhanova et al., unpublished data). The tail encapsidates the 5\u2032-terminal, \u223c700 nt-long, RNA region (Fig. 1C) that contains a packaging signal recognized by CPm (Peremyslov et al., 2004a, Satyanarayana et al., 2004).

            "text": "A salient functional aspect of the BYV virions is that each of the five structural proteins is also required for virus transport (Dolja, 2003). In the case of CP, this requirement could stem, simply, from the need to protect the long and degradation-prone viral RNA during its transport. Indeed, the cell-to-cell movement cycle of a closterovirus takes a day compared to two hours for TMV. However, it seems unlikely that the transport-related function of the tail is merely protective. First, CP can encapsidate the entire genome if the tail formation is prevented by mutations (Alzhanova et al., 2001). Second, the tail harbors Hsp70h, the only viral protein that was found in plasmodesmata (PD), intercellular channels through which viruses translocate (Medina et al., 1999). Third, p20 is dispensable for virion assembly and cell-to-cell movement, but is required for long-distance transport of BYV through the vascular system (Prokhnevsky et al., 2002). All this prompted interpretation of the tail as a device that evolved to facilitate cell-to-cell and systemic transport of the large closterovirus genomes (Dolja, 2003). It should be noted that this concept awaits experimental separation of assembly and transport functions for at least some tail proteins unless there is a causal relationship between the two.",

Arguably, suppression of RNA silencing has emerged recently as a fourth universal function encoded in plant viruses (Baulcombe, 2004). Some plant viruses possess dedicated suppressors, while others delegate this function to replicational, structural, or transport proteins (Silhavy and Burgyan, 2004, Voinett, 2005). Interestingly, most of the dedicated viral suppressors represent small protein families without detectable homologous relationship to any other viral or host proteins. This tendency is often taken as evidence of relatively recent origins of the suppressors that evolved to counteract a powerful system of host defense against parasitic RNAs. The major components of RNA silencing machinery are conserved between diverse eukaryotes suggesting that this machinery emerged not much later than eukaryotes themselves (Anantharaman et al., 2002, Zamore and Haley, 2005). Search for RNA silencing suppressors in closteroviruses yielded several findings that further highlighted the trends in suppressor evolution.",

It has been found that p21 specifically binds double-stranded forms of the small interfering RNA (siRNA) or microRNA (miRNA) (Chapman et al., 2004). Thus, the molecular mechanism of p21 action is similar to that of another well-studied suppressor, p19 of Tomato bushy stunt virus (Silhavy and Burgyan, 2004): both suppressors sequester small RNA effectors of silencing and prevent their loading into the RNA-Induced Silencing Complex (RISC). However, these suppressors cannot discriminate between siRNAs that target viral genomes and endogenous siRNAs and miRNAs that are involved in regulation of plant development. As a result, accumulation of p21 or p19 in plants induces developmental abnormalities many of which are identical to symptoms of viral infection (Chapman et al., 2004). It was concluded that, at least in part, viral pathogenicity is due to interference of silencing suppressors with developmental function of plant small RNAs. Despite their mechanistic similarity, p21 and p19 appear to be structurally and evolutionarily unrelated and neither has detectable homologues outside the respective virus genera (Vargason et al., 2003, Ye and Patel, 2005).",

Subsequent computer analysis of the p23 sequence showed that it has a specific form of the Zn-ribbon module that is present in a variety of cellular proteins and also in several proteins encoded by viruses of the genera Carlavirus and Vitivirus (Chiba et al., 2006). It seems likely that the latter viral proteins are distant homologues of p23. Should it be demonstrated that these proteins are suppressors of RNA silencing, this will be the first viral suppressor family represented in diverse viruses and, possibly, derived from a common host ancestor. It was also found that both CTV p20 and CP can interfere with the systemic spread of silencing, while p23 can only suppress the local silencing (Lu et al., 2004). Thus, CTV evolved a complex system of RNA silencing suppression with three components targeting distinct facets of RNA silencing response.",

One of the components of this system is a 22-kDa protein (p22) that possesses suppressor activity on its own (Fig. 2). This protein is unique to SPCSV and has no detectable sequence similarity to other proteins. A second component is an RNase III homologue containing both the endonuclease and the dsRNA-binding activities typically found in bona fide cellular RNases III including Dicer and Dicer-like proteins, which are involved in the generation and functioning of siRNAs and miRNAs. In addition to SPCSV, RNase III is encoded by several nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (Iyer et al., 2006) where its function remains to be determined. By itself, SPCSV RNase III exhibits no suppressor activity. However, co-expression of RNase III with p22 results in a dramatic increase of RNA silencing suppression (Kreuze et al., 2005). Although the mechanism of this suppression is not known, recruitment of a protein whose homologues function in eukaryotic RNA silencing for the purpose of overcoming host defense is a remarkable example of viral resourcefulness.",

What could be the reason for multiplication of diverse suppressors in closteroviruses as opposed to single suppressors of smaller viruses? One possibility is that the large and slowly replicating closterovirus RNAs are more prone to degradation by the RNA silencing machinery than those of the smaller viruses. Alternatively, the increased complexity of the closterovirus genomes could be of direct relevance. Given that the antiviral siRNAs in infected plants are mostly derived from hairpin elements of the positive RNA strands (Molnar et al., 2005), controller element-rich closteroviral RNAs are likely to harbor more hairpins than the simpler genomes of other viruses.",

In nature, most closteroviruses are inoculated into plants by insect vectors (Karasev, 2000). The initiation of the replication cycle upon virus entry into the cell requires virion disassembly followed by translation of the input viral genome. Association of the virion tail with the capped, 5\u2032-terminal, RNA region suggests a role of the tail proteins in the RNA exposure to translation initiation machinery of the cell. As originally proposed for TMV, subsequent disassembly of the viral particle and liberation of the RNA could be mediated by the elongating ribosomes. The translated polyprotein is processed to yield L-Pro and replicase components that recruit ER and viral RNA to the membrane-bound, replication complexes. The genome-size RNA minus strand is made and used for synthesis of the genome plus strands and sgRNAs, which are exported to the cytosol. The timing and amounts of the synthesis of sgRNAs are regulated to optimize subsequent events of the virus infection cycle. For instance, sgRNAs that encode RNA silencing suppressors are produced early in infection to counteract a potent host defense system. Translation of the nascent genomes results in proliferation of replication complexes concurrent with virion assembly that is triggered by accumulation of the structural proteins.",

Because incorporation of each of the five virion proteins is required for one or both of these processes to occur, at least some of the transport events should involve physical translocation of the mature virions. Our understanding of the mechanistic contributions of the transport proteins remains patchy at best. It is not known how the ER-associated p6 aids the viral cell-to-cell movement.

Moreover, this autonomous targeting has been shown to rely on the actomyosin motility system (Prokhnevsky et al., 2005). It is tempting to propose that one of the roles of Hsp70h present in the virion tails is to interact with myosin and chaperone the virions toward PD. This would provide an added benefit of directionality, with the virion tails put in close proximity or even inserted into PD channels. Although the form in which closteroviral genome traverses PD is not known, the apparent lack of CP within PD might suggest that virions are (partially) disassembled upon passing PD channels (Medina et al., 1999). If this is the case, tail proteins may provide for directional RNA transport, with the 5\u2032-terminal region entering the adjacent cell and being recruited by ribosomes. The rest of the RNA could be pulled into the cytoplasm co-translationally. This speculative model is not without analogy that comes from the nuclear export of giant, \u223c30 kb mRNAs of certain fly species (Daneholt, 2001). These mRNAs are co-transcriptionally assembled into the ribonucleoprotein particles that dock to the nuclear pores with their ends corresponding to the mRNA's 5\u2032-termini. The directional transport through the pore occurs concomitantly with particle thinning and shedding some of the associated proteins.

In all likelihood, multiple cycles of the virus replication on the phloem route are required to ensure successful colonization of the entire plant.

However, slow compared to other plant viruses, the life styles of closteroviruses proved evolutionarily successful given the long and rapidly growing list of closteroviruses that infect a broad range of hosts from cucumbers to strawberries to grapevine to citrus (Aguilar et al., 2003, Martelli, 2002, Tzanetakis et al., 2005a, Tzanetakis et al., 2005b).",

The viruses of the genera Closterovirus, Crinivirus, and Ampelovirus are predominantly transmitted by aphids, whiteflies, and mealybugs, respectively.

This progenitor evolved into the last common ancestor of closteroviruses by acquiring several new genes. Among these, acquisition of the L-Pro gene and a central domain of replicase facilitated RNA replication and conditioned expansion of the progenitor's genome. Concurrently, the Hsp70 gene was incorporated via recombination with a cellular mRNA, whereas the p60 gene originated via duplication and divergence of the CP gene. The co-evolution of Hsp70h and p60 resulted in emergence of a prototype virion tail that empowered cell-to-cell transport of the expanded genome of the ancestral closterovirus.",

The CPms appeared at that time via duplication and divergence of the CP gene. In addition to CPm phylogenenies (Fig. 3D), this scenario is supported by the different order of CP and CPm genes in the genus Closterovirus versus the genera Crinivirus and Ampelovirus (Fig. 2). The latter two genera could arise independently from the common family ancestor (Fig. 4). Alternatively, criniviruses could evolve by the split of a single ampeloviral genomic RNA to two segments (dashed arrow in Fig. 4).

For instance, CTV genes encoding p33, p18, p13, and p23 have no homologues in BYV or other known genus members (Fig. 2) (Pappu et al., 1994). Conspiciously, similar tendency of prolifiration of the virus- or lineage-specific genes is observed in coronaviruses and other large nidoviruses (Gorbalenya et al., 2006). Because the gene repertoirs of smaller RNA viruses tend to be more conserved in any given taxon, it seems that the unusual genetic plasticity of nidoviruses and closteroviruses is conditioned by their genome expansion. The resulting benefit of faster macroevolution via accretion of new genes may provide large RNA viruses with ability to rapidly adapt to new hosts, vectors, or changing environmental conditions.",

Regardless of the adapted eukaryotic phylogeny, the specifics of which remain debated, plants, animals, and diatoms diverged early in the evolution of eukaryotes, and horizontal transfer of picornaviruses from land plants or animals to marine biota seems highly unlikely.

It is further believed that the limitations in the RNA stability and replication fidelity resulted in the evolution of DNA as the dedicated genomic material. It seems that \u223c30 kb could be close to the maximum size of RNA molecules that can function as autonomous genetic elements due to minimal stability requirements. No larger RNAs are known to be used by any viruses, transposable elements, or prokaryotic cells; although eukaryotes do have some giant mRNAs, these are likely to be short-lived and translated via special mechanisms such as coupling of translation with nucleo-cytoplasmic export (Gregorio et al., 1999).",

The idea that the PD is a bottleneck for intercellular translocation of virions or genomes has recently gained experimental support (Gilbertson et al., 2003). The corollary of the limited size and translocation capacity of the PD channels is that viral genomes larger than \u223c8 kbp for dsDNA, \u223c3 kb for ssDNA, or \u223c20 kb for ssRNA cannot move between the cells and therefore are eliminated during evolution.",

It is certainly not the host adaptation or virus\u2013host coevolution because both simple prokaryotic and most complex eukaryotic organisms play hosts for the simple and complex viruses alike. A simple and convincing theory of the origins of genome complexity in eukaryotes has been recently advanced by Lynch and Conery (2003). This theory states that the increase in genome complexity is a stochastic result of the relieved selection pressure that follows dramatic reductions in population size; in small populations, drift may result in fixation of genomic changes, such as duplication of numerous genes and propagation of selfish elements, which are not tolerated in larger populations with intensive purifying selection. Often, the reduction in population size would be caused by local or global environmental catastrophes that lead to abrupt drop in the population size for a few or many species at a time. Support for this non-adaptationist concept of genomic complexity comes from extensive analyses of genes, introns, and selfish DNA in a large number of complete prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes (Koonin, 2004, Lynch and Conery, 2003).",

Another possibility is the emergence of a new antiviral defense system, such as innate or acquired immunity, or RNA silencing. It is, probably, the combination of both that has driven acquisition of multiple new genes by viral genomes in certain lineages, followed by the gradual adaptation of these genes for the needs of infection. A corollary of the comparative analysis of closterovirus genomes is that their relative complexity and variability go hand in hand (Fig. 2).
