Virus neutralising antibodies can be of the IgG, IgA or IgM immunoglobulin isotypes. The amount of antibody required to induce neutralisation is unclear. Some early studies on the kinetics of neutralisation by high affinity antibodies suggested a single hit mechanism, meaning that one virus particle is neutralised by one molecule of antibody. The single hit hypothesis has recently been challenged in favour of multiple hit kinetics with estimates of 10 antibody molecules required to neutralise HIV-1. Multiple hit kinetics are more likely, and in fact are essential, if aggregation of virions by bivalent antibodies is to occur.",

            "text": "Neutralising antibodies can act by blocking the interaction between a cell receptor and the virus attachment proteins present on the virion surface. For non-enveloped viruses, such as the picornaviruses, attachment takes place via interaction with a limited number of structures present on the capsid. For rhinoviruses this is a narrow surface depression (or \u2018canyon\u2019) that surrounds each of the 12 capsid vertices. In contrast there are hundreds of virus glycoproteins present on the surface of an enveloped virus and it is likely that at any one time (i) not all of these are recognised by antibody and (ii) that only one antibody is bound per virus protein, i.e. for the flu HA spike, which has five sites recognised by neutralising antibody, only one of these sites may be occupied on a single HA molecule. The size of an antibody molecule and the distribution of these sites on HA would support this view. In addition to sterically hindering the interaction between virus and receptor, antibodies can interfere with uncoating, by either triggering a stage of uncoating prematurely or preventing uncoating by cross-linking surface structures on the virion. Some antibodies inhibit fusion (the first stage of uncoating) probably by preventing the conformational change in the virus proteins required to allow fusion to occur. Rhinovirus capsids are known to undergo a pH-mediated conformational change within the endosome, allowing the virus genome to escape the endosome. It is possible that antibodies can prevent this change, so blocking genome release.",

This decreases the ability of the virus to interact with cells and targets the virus for phagocytosis. In all the mechanisms outlined above, complement can act to increase the effectiveness of antibody. Non-neutralising antibodies are also produced during the immune response and are likely to contribute to recovery by activating complement or by interacting with Fc receptors on NK cells/macrophages.",

            "text": "As discussed above, antibodies neutralise free virus particles liberated from cells, but, despite the help of complement and of phagocytes with Fc receptors, are less able to influence events in infected cells. Action on the infected cell seems necessary for recovery from the above virus infections. The destruction of cells infected with viruses takes place in various ways but depends on the mechanism of virus maturation in the cell. The non-enveloped viruses, such as poliovirus or papilloma viruses, replicate and produce fully infectious particles inside the cytoplasm. These particles consist of the nucleic acid with its protein coat (capsid) and are exposed to antibody when liberated from the cell (Figure 9.1\n). Enveloped viruses are liberated by a process of budding from cell membranes. The viral genome and nucleoproteins or capsids become closely associated with the cell membrane, either the cytoplasmic membrane or in some cases (e.g. herpes, pox) with an internal membrane and acts as an initiation point for the viral envelope proteins (Figure 9.1). The virus particle matures by budding through the altered membrane, acquiring an envelope as it does so. There are two important consequences of this mechanism of virus maturation. First, virus can be released even though the cell remains alive and intact. Second, the foreign viral glycoproteins appearing on the cell surface are recognised by host antibody and an immune response is generated with the infected cell as the target. The significance of this is that the infected cell can be destroyed before virus has been liberated as viral glycoproteins often appear on the cell surface early in the replication process, before progeny virus particles have been formed.",

            "text": "Various bacteria have been shown to make specific attachments to epithelial surfaces and here secretory IgA antibodies are significant. IgA antibodies are formed in most infections of mucosal surfaces whether bacterial, viral or due to other microorganisms. They tend to prevent re-infection, but if formed early enough in the primary infection they could block the attachment of the microorganism to susceptible cells or cell surfaces and thus interfere with the spread of infection. Their actual function in recovery, however, is doubtful. As was pointed out earlier, virus infections that are limited to epithelial surfaces and do not have a time-consuming spread of infection through the body have incubation periods of no more than a few days. There is little opportunity for the slowly evolving immune response to play an important role in recovery, and virus replication is often inhibited before there has been a detectable IgA response. On the other hand, it must be remembered that antibodies (IgG or IgA) can be produced locally within two days after experimental respiratory tract infections, for instance, and they would not be detected routinely when bound to viral antigens at this stage. But interferon is produced by the first infected cell and is likely to have an important local antiviral action. If the process of infection takes longer, then secretory IgA antibodies have more opportunity to aid recovery. When the intestinal protozoan Giardia lamblia causes symptoms, these are not seen until 6\u201315 days after infection. A role for secretory IgA antibodies is indicated because patients with a shortage of these antibodies show troublesome and persistent giardial infection.",

These are the common pyogenic (pus-forming) infections. For its anti-bacterial function, antibody needs to operate together with phagocytic cells and complement and, if either of these are missing, resistance to pyogenic infections is impaired. Children with agammaglobulinaemia suffer repeated infections with pyogenic bacteria. The spleen is an important site of antibody formation, and when the spleen has been removed surgically, or rendered incompetent in children with sickle cell disease, there is increased susceptibility to such infections. On the other hand, many bacterial infections (tuberculosis, syphilis, typhoid, gonorrhoea) can persist or can re-infect in spite of the presence of large amounts of antibody. This is discussed more fully in Chapter 7, and it is a reminder of the frequent inability of antibodies to ensure recovery.",

Disseminated infection with certain fungi (Coccidioides, Histoplasma) occurs even in the presence of high antibody titres, and in such cases there is usually no CMI demonstrable by skin tests, suggesting that T-cell responses matter most. Local infections with fungi elicit good CMI responses but poor antibody responses, and the patient recovers. Severe mucocutaneous candidiasis is seen in those with defective CMI, in spite of normal antibody production. Although CMI is central for recovery from the majority of fungal infections, antibody with anti-fungal properties are produced during infection as determined by monoclonal antibodies against membrane antigens of Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida albicans. Such antibodies when injected into infected mice protect against infection. Therapeutic antibodies are being used to control a number of infectious diseases.",

            "text": "Small microorganisms such as viruses may have no more than one (HIV, human immunodeficiency virus) or two different proteins on their surface. The surface of influenza virus, for instance, consists of 500 or more haemagglutinin trimers, interlaced with about 100 neuraminidase tetramers. Antibodies to either antigen protect against infection, although the haemagglutinin contains the major neutralisation sites. Antibody to the neuraminidase inhibits its enzymatic activity. It does not prevent infection of the cell but prevents the dissemination of newly formed virus and thus hinders the spread of infection. This occurs because neuraminidase is required to detach haemagglutinin from sialic acid at the point on the cell membrane where the virus emerges. One can begin to work out the mechanisms of antibody protection in a relatively simple microorganism of this sort. Larger microorganisms, however, generally have many different proteins and carbohydrates on their surface. Some of these will be concerned with vital steps in the process of infection, and antibodies to specific neutralisation sites on these will be protective. Antibodies to other antigenic sites on these structures and even to some complete structures will not be protective, and when they are attached to the microbial surface may even physically interfere with (block) the action of protective antibodies. In addition, a large assortment of irrelevant antibodies are produced to internal components of the microorganism. Antibodies themselves differ in the firmness of the combination they make with antigens and may be of high or low avidity (see Glossary). Thus the quality of the antibody also matters. Protection by antibody is therefore a complicated matter, and if there is no protection in spite of the presence of large amounts of antibody, one has to ask first what components of the microbe these antibodies are combining with, and whether these antibodies have the relevant specificity for the job. Second, one needs to ask whether the antibody itself is of sufficient quality and of the appropriate isotype.",

            "text": "As presented in Chapter 6, T cells are a heterogeneous population of cells as reflected by cytokine profiles and effector function. In particular, CD4 T cells assume a central role in coordinating cells from the innate response in recovery from infection. This is reflected in tissue responses in the host that bear the hallmarks of T-cell involvement, with the infiltrating cells consisting primarily of lymphocytes and macrophages. The nature of the particular T-cell subset will depend on the pathogen. For example, Th17 cells are important in recovery from extracellular bacteria and fungal infections including Staphylococcus aureus, whereas intra-cellular bacteria such as tuberculosis, brucellosis, listeriosis, tularaemia, syphilis and tuberculoid leprosy are controlled by Th1 cells. In Leishmania infection, recovery is associated with the development of a Th1 response. This is orchestrated by the production of interleukin-12 (IL-12) from infected macrophages which acts on either natural killer (NK) cells or CD4+ T cells to produce interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF), which in turn feeds back on macrophages to induce nitric oxide, an important molecule in controlling this parasite. The blockade of IL-12 activity in vivo, either by neutralising antibodies or the use of IL-12-deficient mice, leads to the development of a Th2 response which fails to protect the host from a generalised parasite infection, through a lack of nitric oxide production. Similar mechanisms operate in recovery from Listeria infection, illustrating the central role of IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3 in the evolution of Thl-protective immune responses. In some situations persistence of antigen, as with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, can lead to protracted Th1 responses resulting in chronic inflammation. These responses are characteristic of delayed-type hypersensitivity which can be demonstrated in a specific manner by skin testing.",

            "text": "The clearest picture about CMI in recovery comes from certain virus infections, particularly herpes viruses, poxviruses, influenza virus. All viruses utilise the cellular translation machinery to produce virus proteins and so a proportion of these proteins enter the MHC I processing pathway in a manner similar to all other cellular proteins. It can be argued that MHC I/CD8+ T-cell responses evolved primarily to combat virus infections, as destruction of infected host cells has long been considered a feature of viral rather than other infections. There is now, however, evidence for this occurring with other infections. Host cells infected in vitro with protozoa (Plasmodia and Theileria), rickettsia (Coxiella burnetii) and with certain bacteria (Listeria) can present pathogen derived peptides in the context of MHC I. This is achieved as a natural consequence of degradation of intra-cellular antigens by the proteolytic machinery of the infected cell and the presentation of antigenic peptides by MHC class I. Consequently, whether a cell is infected by an enveloped or non-enveloped virus, a bacterium or a parasite, antigens can be recognised by cytotoxic T cells (CTLs).",

            "text": "The immune mechanisms for the destruction of cells bearing foreign antigens on their surface can be summarised as \u2018burns\u2019, \u2018pores\u2019 or \u2018poisons\u2019 and are as follows:1.As mentioned above (Chapter 6), T-cell receptors only recognise peptides in association with MHC class I proteins (CD8 T cells) or class II proteins (CD4 T cells) on the target cell surface. Any viral protein can be processed in this way and usually internal virion proteins or non-virion (e.g. nuclear-transcription factors) proteins provide the major target for T cells. In order to destroy a target cell, T cells must become activated. Once this is achieved, the activated CTL makes intimate contact with the target cell membrane and delivers a lethal hit. The T cell then disengages and moves to another target. Killing of target cells occurs by one of two mechanisms. One mechanism involves releasing the contents of cytotoxic granules containing perforin, which deposits \u2018pores\u2019 in the membrane of the target cell, and granzyme B, which enters the cell through the pores to act as a \u2018poison\u2019 in triggering apoptosis. Perforin is homologous to C9, the pore-forming component of complement. Both proteins polymerise on contact with the target cell breaching the membrane and producing pores through which electrolytes and other molecules flow causing cell damage. In contrast to apoptosis, cellular necrosis may occur (possibly as a result of large amounts of perforin being deposited) in which there is a leakage of cell components and K+ ions, an influx of water and Na+ ions, and the target cell swells up and dies. NK cells also use the perforin lytic mechanism to kill target cells. A second method that triggers cell death is the interaction of Fas (a TNF-like receptor on target cells) with the Fas ligand (on T cells), said to be the \u2018kiss of death\u2019, due to the activation of the \u2018death\u2019 domain in the cytoplasmic tail of Fas. This results in the initiation of a cascade of cellular proteases leading to apoptosis. An additional cytolytic mechanism involves the cytokine IL-7. This cytokine mediates killing of persistent virus-infected cells involving interaction with the intracellular protein arih2. IL-7 is presently undergoing clinical trials against a variety of persistent viral and bacterial infections.2.Macrophages, polymorphs (neutrophils, basophils and eosinophils) and NK cells have the ability to destroy target cells with the assistance of specific antibody (antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC)). Antibody combines with antigen on the infected cell surface, and the killer cell attaches to the antibody-coated cells via the Fc receptor. The process is enhanced when complement is activated, the C3b molecules deposited on the cell surface being recognised by mononuclear and phagocytic cells that bear C3b receptors. The final killing mechanism is not clear, but the killer cell releases oxygen radicals and hydrogen peroxide (see p. 92) which \u2018burn\u2019 the target cell. The Fc receptors for IgG and IgE on eosinophils enable them to kill multicellular parasites such as schistosomes after adhering in large numbers to the antibody-coated surface of these parasites. This involves releasing toxic proteins (e.g. major basic protein and eosinophil cationic protein) directly onto the parasite surface to \u2018burn\u2019 holes in the tegument, enabling eosinophils to enter the parasite to deliver the coup de grace. These proteins are so toxic they can also damage mammalian cells, so the eosinophil carefully seals the area on the parasite where the proteins are delivered. Why the eosinophil is not destroyed is a mystery.\n",

            "text": "Destruction of infected cells is not the only mechanism available to T cells in controlling a virus infection. In hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection of the liver and in herpes simplex virus infection of neurons, CD8+ T cells act to \u2018cure\u2019 the infection rather than kill the cells. This has been demonstrated in a transgenic mouse model of HBV infection in which every hepatocyte expresses viral genomes. By delivering immune T cells to these mice, the infection is readily controlled, but widespread destruction of hepatocytes is not observed. The key protective mechanism is IFN-\u03b3, released by the activated CD8+ T cells, which blocks virus replication and rids the cells of the viral genome. A similar mechanism operates in HBV infected chimpanzees, the other natural host for this virus. In neurons infected with herpes simplex virus, it is likely that similar CD8+ T-cell control mechanisms occur, since neurons expressing late virus proteins (an indicator of the late stages of virus replication) can be prevented from cell death and \u2018cured\u2019 of this productive infection. However, the virus may persist in a latent form. This strategy benefits the virus in terms of its survival as a latent infection and also the host in retaining the function of these irreplaceable cells. A decision on whether HBV or herpes virus-infected cells are killed or cured could be related to the amount of MHC class I expression on the infected cell. When MHC expression is high, these cells can be targeted by CTLs and killed. When MHC expression is low, CTLs may have difficulty directly engaging the target cell but can still influence virus replication through the local release of IFN-\u03b3. This further illustrates the diversity of antiviral mechanisms at the disposal of the host.",

When a T cell encounters the antigen to which it is specifically sensitised, it becomes activated and divides to give fresh supplies of specifically sensitised T cells. These can react with any cell presenting the relevant peptide in association with a MHC molecule. Cytokines are liberated to attract macrophages and other leucocytes and focus them onto the site of infection. Infected cells are destroyed or cured by cytotoxic T lymphocytes and other cells, and virus material and cell debris is phagocytosed and disposed of by activated macrophages.

This approach enables T cells or other cells to be depleted at any stage in the immune response to infective agent. An alternative method is to use transgenic \u2018knockout\u2019 mice in which the gene encoding the protein of interest is inactivated at the DNA level. This powerful technology enables selected defects in host defence to occur, resulting in deficiencies of, for example, IFN-\u03b3, TNF, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10 or their receptors; CD8 and CD4 T-cell function (disrupt CD8 or CD4 genes) and B-cell function (disrupt expression of IgM). Most of these gene knockout mice develop normally and remain well but show increased susceptibility to intra-cellular infections caused by various viruses, bacteria or protozoa. The picture is however complex. Deleting one cytokine or cell function upsets a delicate network of anti-microbial forces. Often a different defence mechanism takes over the function of the one that has been deleted. In other words, there is a redundancy in host defence mechanisms, as might be expected as an evolutionary response to infectious agents that often evade or interfere with these mechanisms.",

Thymic aplasia gives some insight into the importance of CMI in infectious diseases. Affected infants show a normal ability to control most bacterial infections, but a greatly increased susceptibility to infections with various viruses and certain other intra-cellular microorganisms. After measles infection, for instance, there is no rash in these children, but an uncontrolled and progressive growth of virus in the respiratory tract, leading to fatal giant cell pneumonia. Evidently the CMI response controls the infectious process and at the same time plays a vital role in the development of skin lesions. In the days when affected children were vaccinated against smallpox with vaccinia virus, the virus grew as usual in epidermal cells at the inoculation site to give an increasing zone of skin destruction. In normal infants there was an inflammatory response at the edges of the lesion after 6\u20138 days and this led to inhibition of virus growth, then scabbing and healing of the lesion. The infant with thymic aplasia, however, did not show this response and the destructive skin lesion continued to enlarge, occupying an ever-increasing area of the arm and shoulder. The infection could be controlled by local injection of immune lymphocytes from a closely related donor, but not by antibody. Infants with this type of immune deficiency also tend to suffer severe generalised infections with herpes simplex virus. In addition, they show increased susceptibility to other intra-cellular microorganisms. When they are vaccinated against tuberculosis with live BCG vaccine, the attenuated bacteria (instead of undergoing limited growth with induction of a good CMI response) multiply in an uncontrolled fashion and may eventually kill the patient. The CMI response is therefore necessary for the control of infection with intra-cellular bacteria of this type.",

Inflammation is necessary for the proper functioning of the immune defences because it focuses all circulating anti-microbial factors onto the site of infection. The circulating anti-microbial forces that arrive in tissues include polymorphs, macrophages, lymphocytes, antibodies, activated complement components and materials like fibrin that play a part in certain infections. The increased blood supply and temperature in inflamed tissues favour maximal metabolic activity on the part of leucocytes, and the slight lowering of pH tends to inhibit the multiplication of many extracellular microorganisms. The prompt increase in circulating polymorphs during pyogenic infections is caused in the first place by the release of cells held in reserve in the bone marrow, but there is also an increase in the rate of production. Monocyte release and production is controlled independently. At least four colony-stimulating factors, all glycoproteins, control the mitosis of polymorph and macrophage precursors, and their final differentiation and activity.

Infections do not generally last for long periods if they induce acute polymorphonuclear inflammation; the battle between host and microbe is decided at an early stage. Chronic inflammation depends on a constant leakage of microbial products and antigens from the site of infection. The type of infection that persists and causes chronic inflammation is generally an intra-cellular bacterial or fungal or chlamydial infection. In these infections there is a chronic CMI response, with proliferation of lymphocytes and fibroblasts in infected areas, a steady influx of macrophages, and the formation of giant and epithelioid cells. Episodes of tissue necrosis alternate with repair and the formation of granulation tissue, then fibrous tissue. It is a ding-dong battle between microorganisms and host anti-microbial forces. The resulting granuloma (see also above) can be regarded as an attempt to wall off the infected area. Chronic infections with chronic inflammation and granuloma formation include tuberculosis, syphilis, actinomycosis, leprosy, lymphogranuloma inguinale and coccidiodomycosis.

            "text": "Complement has been discussed and invoked on many occasions in Chapters 6\u20138Chapter 6Chapter 7Chapter 8 and in this chapter. It should be remembered that some of the complement components are quite large molecules and do not readily leave the circulation except where there is local inflammation. Complement can carry out anti-microbial activities in the following ways:1.\nComplement lysis. Complement reacts with antibody (IgG and IgM) that has attached to the surface of infected cells or to the surface of certain microorganisms, and destroys the cell or microorganism after making holes in the surface membrane. Gram-negative bacteria are killed in this way and also enveloped viruses such as rubella and parainfluenza (although as mentioned above, lack of complement does not exacerbate these virus infections). Because of the amplification occurring in the complement system (see Chapter 6), especially when the alternative pathway is also activated, antibody attached to the surface of a microorganism is more likely to induce complement lysis than it is to neutralise it. Complement lysis is therefore perhaps more important when antibody molecules are in short supply, early in the immune response. Bacteria with surface polysaccharide components can activate complement without the need for antibody (see 5, below), as can host cells infected with viruses such as measles. In the latter case, alternative pathway activation by itself does not do enough damage to kill the cell. Presumably, less severe membrane lesions can be repaired; antibody as well as complement must be present for lysis.2.\nComplement opsonisation. Complement reacts with antibody attached to the surface of microorganisms, providing additional receptor sites for phagocytosis by cells bearing the appropriate complement receptors, like polymorphs or macrophages. Phagocytosis is also promoted by antibody attached to the microorganism because of the Fc receptors on phagocytes, but when complement is activated there are many more molecules of C3b present as a result of the amplification phenomenon. Therefore complement often has a more pronounced opsonising effect than antibody alone and for some bacteria, such as the pneumococcus, opsonisation actually depends on complement. Complement opsonisation is important when the antibody is IgM, because human phagocytes do not have receptors for the Fc region of IgM. Complement can also act as an opsonin though not always so effectively, in the absence of antibody (see 5, below).3.\nComplement-mediated inflammation. Specific antibodies react with microbial antigens that are either free or on the surface of microorganisms. Following this antigen\u2013antibody reaction, complement is activated, with generation of inflammatory and chemotactic factors (C3a and C5a). These substances focus anti-microbial serum factors and leucocytes onto the site of infection.4.\nComplement-assisted neutralisation of viruses. In the case of viruses coated with antibody, complement adds to the mass of molecules on the virus surface and may hinder attachment of virus to susceptible cells. In some situations complement can mediate neutralisation of virus coated with a non-neutralising antibody. This will depend on the antibody isotype and presumably the density of antibody on the surface of the virus. Some viruses (murine leukaemia virus, Sindbis virus) can directly activate the complement system by interaction of virion envelope proteins with Clq or C3, resulting in the neutralisation of infectivity.5.\nComplement-assisted cell lysis. C3b deposition on infected host cells not only opsonises (see above) but also augments ADCC and antibody-dependent complement-mediated lysis of cells.\n6.\nComplement opsonisation via alternative pathway. Complement reacting with endotoxin on the surface of Gram-negative bacilli, with capsular polysaccharide of pneumococci, etc., or with Candida, is activated via the alternative pathway and C3b-mediated opsonisation takes place. It seems likely that this is important in natural resistance to infection.\n",

The rare patients with C3 deficiency develop repeated pyogenic infections, and C3-deficient mice show increased susceptibility to plague and to staphylococcal infections. Mice with C5 deficiency (controlled by a single gene) are more susceptible to Candida infection, probably because of inadequate opsonisation. Patients with C5\u2013C8 deficiencies, however, are often particularly susceptible to disseminated or recurrent neisserial infection. In this case the bactericidal rather than the opsonising action of complement seems important. But observations on complement deficiencies are probably too limited to draw firm conclusions and there have been few clearly defined deficiencies. The system is a highly complex one, with alternative pathways, positive feedback amplification and multiple inhibitors. A similar complement system occurs in a wide range of vertebrates and it must be assumed that such a complex, powerful system confers some biological advantage, presumably by giving resistance to microbial infections.",

Some of these gene products (e.g. 2\u20325\u2032A synthetase/RNAseL) target viral messenger RNA and others (e.g. PKR) inactivate polypeptide chain elongation, blocking viral protein synthesis. Interferons are exceedingly potent in vitro, being active at about 10\u221215\n \nm. They have no direct action on virus itself and do not interfere with viral entry into the susceptible cell. The interferons produced by different species of animals are to a large extent species specific in their action. Interferon liberated from infected cells can reach other cells in the vicinity by diffusion and establishes an antiviral state which protects them from infection. A cell is thus protected from infection with all viruses for a period of up to 24 h. It would seem inevitable that interferon is important in recovery from virus infections, whether on epithelial surfaces or in solid tissues. Interferons are also induced by non-viral agents such as rickettsiae and other bacteria, and will protect cells from various non-viral intra-cellular microorganisms and have other effects on host resistance. They activate NK cells and control T-cell activity by upregulating the expression of MHC proteins and thus the concentration of available peptide antigen.",

For instance, volunteers infected intranasally with rhinoviruses and other respiratory viruses have been given either poly(I:C) or repeated very large doses of purified human interferon by the same route, but with only slight protection. However, it has proved useful in clearing up some cases of chronic hepatitis B infection and is being used to treat hepatitis caused by the flavivirus, hepatitis C. HBV downregulates the expression of MHC class I proteins on infected hepatocytes, thus preventing CD8+ T cells from destroying infected cells. By treating with IFN-\u03b3 or IFN-\u03b1, expression of MHC class I proteins is upregulated and CTLs can act. Initially the patient may become ill from the effects of interferon, but eventually a virus-free liver regenerates.

Further support for the importance of interferons in anti-microbial defences comes from the discovery that certain viruses have gene products that interfere with the antiviral action of interferon (see Chapter 7).",

In the case of influenza virus infection of ferrets, which is the best animal model for transmission of human influenza, there is a direct correlation between virulence and viral pyrogenicity. IL-1 is released locally in the respiratory tract as a result of virus\u2013phagocyte interaction. Since fever is such a constant sequel of infection, it is natural to suppose that it has some anti-microbial benefit. Thomas Sydenham in the seventeenth century wrote that \u2018Fever is a mighty engine which nature brings into the world for the conquest of her enemies\u2019. Bodily functions are profoundly disturbed by fever. Metabolic activity is increased in phagocytic cells, and studies in vitro show that there are large increases in T-cell proliferation and in antibody production at febrile temperatures. The evidence, however, is disappointing. Temperature-sensitive mutants of certain viruses are often less virulent, and experimental virus infections can sometimes be made more severe by preventing fever with antipyretic drugs. When fever is induced in infected animals by raising the environmental temperature, there are also other complex physiological changes, making it difficult to interpret such experiments. In two bacterial infections, gonorrhoea and syphilis, the microbes themselves are actually killed by febrile temperatures, but in the natural disease these temperatures are rarely reached. Before the introduction of antibiotics, patients with these two diseases were infected with malaria in order to induce body temperatures high enough to eradicate the infection (following which the malaria was treated with quinine).",

Superficial tissue debris, including necrotic epidermis, inflammatory cells and plasma exudate, dries off as a scab. This gives mechanical protection, acts as a barrier to further infection, and can be shed to the exterior after repair is completed. Below the scab, phagocytic cells clear up the debris and fibroblasts move in, multiply and lay down a mucopolysaccharide matrix over the underlying intact tissues. New blood vessels are formed, and later on lymphatics, by the sprouting of the endothelial cells of neighbouring vessels into the fibroblast matrix. The newly formed capillaries advance into the damaged zone at 0.1\u20130.6 \u03bcm a day. They are fragile and leaky, and there is a continuous extravasation of polymorphs, macrophages and fibroblasts into the matrix. As seen from the surface, each collection of capillary loops in the fibroblast matrix looks like a small red granule and this soft vascular material is therefore called granulation tissue. It bleeds easily and with its rich blood supply and abundant phagocytic cells is well protected against infection. Meanwhile, epidermal cells at the edges of the gap have been multiplying. The newly formed layer of cells creeps over the granulation tissue, and the epidermis is thus reconstituted. Fibroblasts in the granulation tissue lay down reticulum fibres and later collagen. If the area of epidermal cell destruction is large, and when underlying sebaceous glands, hair follicles, etc. are destroyed, a great deal of collagenous fibrous tissue is formed to repair the gap. The newly formed collagen in fibrous tissue contracts and tends to bring the skin edges together. Contracting collagen can strangle an organ like the liver, but in the skin it merely forms a scar. A scar is a characteristic sequel to vaccination with BCG, or to a bacterial infection involving sebaceous glands, as seen in severe acne.",

Phagocytic cells must now ingest and dispose of tissue debris, and the epithelial surface must be reconstituted by a burst of mitotic activity in adjacent epithelial cells. To some extent, pre-existing cells can slide across the gap but repair depends on mitosis in cells at the edges. The process of repair takes several days, and the mechanism is the same whether the damage is caused by viruses, bacteria or chemicals. Epithelial regeneration is particularly rapid in respiratory epithelium, and also in conjunctiva, oropharynx and mucocutaneous junctions, but it is delayed if the infection continues. After chronic bacterial or chemical damage, there is an increase in mucus-producing goblet cells in the respiratory epithelium, and sometimes impairment of mucociliary mechanisms, resulting in the condition called chronic bronchitis.

In the case of cardiac muscle, striated muscle or brain, the differentiated cells show little if any mitotic capacity and destruction in these tissues results in a permanent deficit in the number of cells. This may be of no consequence in a muscle as long as firm scar tissue repairs the damage, but it may be important in the central nervous system. Anterior horn cells destroyed by poliovirus cannot be replaced, and if enough are destroyed there will be a permanent paralysis, although some restoration of function takes place by learning to use muscles more effectively and by the recovery of damaged anterior horn cells.",

On the other hand, at critical times in foetal life, there is a programmed cell division and differentiation in the course of constructing certain major organs. If one of these organs is damaged at this critical time, the developmental process is upset and the organ is malformed. This is what happens when rubella virus infects the human foetus during the first three months of pregnancy. Depending on the exact organ system being formed at the time of foetal infection, there may be damage to the heart, eyes, ears or brain, resulting in congenital heart disease, cataract, deafness or mental retardation in the infant.

Passive immunisation with antibody is known to protect humans against measles, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, rabies, etc., and the passively acquired (maternal) immunity of the newborn child or calf to a great variety of infections is another example of the resistance conferred by specific antibody. Most resistance to re-infection is antibody-mediated. IgG antibodies generally continue to be formed in the body many years after the initial infection; IgA antibodies are less persistent than IgG antibodies. Even if antibody levels are undetectable, memory B cells from the initial infection are often present in large enough numbers to give an accelerated (anamnestic) response within a few days of re-infection. This is especially important in infectious diseases with incubation periods measured in weeks because there is time enough for the anamnestic response to operate and terminate the infection during the incubation period, before production of clinical disease. Sometimes resistance to re-infection is maintained by repeated subclinical infections, each of which boosts the immune response. For instance, children catching rubella at school can re-infect their immune parents sub-clinically and this is detected by a rise in antibody levels. Resistance to rubella, diphtheria and perhaps other infectious diseases is maintained in this way.",

Other antibodies protect against re-infection by combining with the microbial surface and blocking attachment to susceptible cells or body surfaces. Microorganisms that need to make specific attachments are listed in Table 2.1. However, circulating IgG or IgM antibodies coat polioviruses, coxsackie viruses or adenoviruses, and act by interfering with viral uncoating rather than by blocking attachment to susceptible cells. Secretory IgA antibodies are particularly important because they can act on the microorganism before its attachment to a body surface. They do not act as opsonins, and they do not lyse microorganisms because there is no complement on body surfaces, and in any case they fix complement poorly. But by preventing the attachment of microorganisms such as Vibrio cholerae to intestinal epithelium, the gonococcus to urethral epithelium, or Chlamydia to the conjunctiva, IgA antibodies can ensure that these microorganisms are carried away in fluid secretions rather than initiate infection. Acquired resistance to infection of the surface of the body is often of short duration. For instance, resistance to gonorrhoea or parainfluenza viruses following natural infection seems to last only for a month or so, and in childhood repeated infections with respiratory syncytial virus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae are common. Presumably the IgA antibodies that mediate resistance are short-lived and IgA memory cells do not generate a good enough or rapid enough secondary response.",

Resistance to the disease influenza or poliomyelitis, however, depends on the separate acquisition of resistance to a number of distinct antigenic types of influenza or polioviruses. Resistance to streptococci depends on the acquisition of antibodies to the M protein in the bacterial cell wall, and since there are at least 10 types of M protein that circulate quite commonly in communities (40\u201350 types of M protein altogether), repeated infections with S. pyogenes occur as antibodies are gradually developed against the various types.
