In previous studies we have identified admission D-dimer [1] , prothrombin time (PT) [2] , and thrombocytopenia [3] as prognostic markers of severe disease and/ or mortality in COVID- 19 . We suspect that elevated D-dimer values at hospital admission and during further disease progression may be reflective of COVID-19-induced pulmonary inflammation with local activation of platelets and blood coagulation, accompanied by relative hypofibrinolysis, which later spills into systemic circulation [4] . Moreover, we have also reported elevated values of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and bilirubin, frequently associated with decreased hemoglobin concentration, in patients with severe and fatal COVID-19 [2] which, given all the above and combined with clinical observations, suggests the potential of hyperinflammation, leading to a thrombotic microangiopathy-like phenomenon.",

The development of multiple and likely primary microthrombi within the pulmonary vasculature may explain the rapid deterioration and pulmonary collapse that is observed in patients who suddenly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with significant pulmonary edema, hypoxemia, V/Q mismatch and shunting. With progressive hyperinflammation, a systemic microangiopathy may lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), encompassing cardiomyopathy, acute kidney and liver failure, mesenteric ischemia, and neurological insults.",

We proffer, based on animal models and in vitro studies of SARS-CoV-1, as well as reported data thus far on COVID-19, that SARS-CoV-2 impairs innate and adaptive antiviral responses, triggers hyperinflammation, and deranges the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), all culminating to promote detrimental hypercoagulability and immunothrombosis. SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 share up to 85% genomic identity, and both utilize the same primary human host receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), to enter target cells [7] . Due to their homology, similar clinical and immunopathologic aspects are expected to occur, but differences may also exist, and caution is needed when extrapolating data from SARS to COVID-19. For example, the binding affinity for ACE2 of the spike surface glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 is considerably higher than that of the homologous protein on SARS-CoV-1, thus potentially magnifying virulence and pathogenicity in vivo of the more recent SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.",

            "text": "Innate immune cells express pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) which can recognize molecular patterns associated with pathogens (PAMPs) or danger (DAMPs). RNA viruses (like SARS-CoV-2) can be recognized by endosomal and cytoplasmic PRRs (including TLR3, TLR7, RIG-I and MDA-5), leading to production of type I interferons (IFNs) [8] . Type I IFNs (IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2) are key players in the host response against viral infections, as they block viral replication and augment antiviral effector mechanisms [8] . SARS-CoV-1 (and likely the homologous SARS-CoV-2) express proteins that inhibit type I IFN production (e.g. through inhibition of TLR3 and TLR7 signaling pathways), which delays the antiviral response and facilitates rapid viral replication and extensive virus-induced direct cytopathic effects in early stages of disease [9] [10] [11] . A subsequent dysregulated, delayed and persistent type I IFN response will, together with cytokines, chemokines and DAMPs released from infected pneumocytes, may orchestrate excessive infiltration of monocyte/macrophages (M\u00f8) and neutrophils (PMNs) in lung parenchyma [12] . These M\u00f8 and PMNs can in turn produce high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (including interleukin (IL) 1\u03b2, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1)) and chemokines, which further amplify the recruitment of innate immune cells, potentially culminating in hyperinflammation and the observed cytokine storm that characterizes the most severe cases of COVID-19 [13] . The association between timing of type I IFN response and disease severity has been demonstrated in a mouse model of SARS [12] . Early administration of . SARS-CoV-2 is associated with an impaired antiviral host response, leading to rapid viral replication and a subsequent hyperinflammatory state. The hyperinflammation and virus-induced dysregulation of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) induces acute lung injury, leading to hypoxemia. Together, hyperinflammation, RAAS and hypoxemia induces endothelial dysfunction and a hypercoagulable state leading to widespread immunothrombosis which further propagates organ damage. ACE = angiotensin converting enzyme, ACE2 = angiotensin converting enzyme 2, AngII = angiotensin II, ARDS = acute respiratory distress syndrome, AT1 = angiotensin II receptor type 1, MAC = membrane attack complex, M\u00f8 = monocytes/ macrophages, PAI-1 = plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, PMN = polymorphonuclear neutrophils, SARS-CoV-2 = severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, TF = tissue factor, TFPI = tissue factor pathway inhibitor, tPA = tissue plasminogen activator. recombinant IFN-\u03b2 protected mice from clinical disease, while an aberrant delayed and persistent type I IFN response was associated with severe lung damage, with massive immune cell infiltration, high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, vascular leakage and alveolar edema [12] . Importantly, mice lacking type I IFN receptors (Ifnar-/-) had a mild disease, with markedly reduced pulmonary immunopathology [12] . This illustrates that antiviral type I IFNs may contribute to pulmonary immune cell infiltration and detrimental hyperinflammation if their expression is dysregulated. Furthermore, the same animal model of SARS confirmed that excessive M\u00f8 recruitment and activation plays a central role in pulmonary immunopathology, as M\u00f8 depletion ameliorated lung damage, without significantly affecting the viral load [12] .",

However, immunobiological sex differences may also contribute. The TLR7 gene is located on chromosome X, and escapes X chromosome inactivation, resulting in enhanced expression in females [21] . TLR7 agonists induce more pronounced IFN-\u03b1 release from cells in females [22] , and estradiol enhances type I IFN release following TLR7 agonism [23] . Biallelic TLR7 expression and estradiol signaling may potentially render females less prone to the viral type I IFN antagonism, which may lead to a more substantial type I IFN response in early stages of disease. This may potentially improve the initial antiviral response and prevent the subsequent aberrant hyperinflammation, in part explaining increased disease severity in males. However, this theory requires additional studies.",

The coagulation system is activated through the tissue factor ('extrinsic') pathway, is amplified by the formerly known 'intrinsic' pathway (now called \"thrombin burst\"), which finally converges to activate the 'common' pathway, where Factor Va (FVa) and FXa converts prothrombin into thrombin [28] . Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin, which is stabilized into the clot by FXIIIa activity. Clots are broken down by plasmin, in a process called fibrinolysis, initiated by two proteins that convert plasminogen to plasmin, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA). tPA is more specific to the breakdown of fibrin, while uPA is involved in acute inflammation, wound healing and tissue repair [29] . Both tPA and uPA are inhibited by plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). The balance between tPA/uPA and PAI-1 ensures balanced homeostasis. However, in general ARDS (and likely COVID-19 induced ARDS), this balance is disturbed, with excessive PAI-1 resulting in relative hypofibrinolysis leading to fibrin deposition in the alveoli and perialveolar capillary microthrombosis [29] .",

Furthermore, PMNs can release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) containing DAMPs and various other bioactive molecules in a process called NETosis. NETs stimulate the intrinsic pathway through activation of FXII. NETs also activate endothelial cells, platelets and complement system, and contain proteases which inactivates endogenous anticoagulants, thus propagating the pro-coagulant state [30] . While NETosis is typically associated with responses against extracellular pathogens, increasing evidence show that NETosis also occurs in viral infections [31] .

Notwithstanding direct viral cytopathic effects, as hyperinflammation drives forward local and systemic endothelial dysfunction and injury, this results in increased vascular permeability, excess thrombin generation (also a major activator of platelets) and inhibition of fibrinolysis [27] . In patients with non-specific ARDS, plasma levels of TF and PAI-1 are significantly elevated compared to non-ARDS patients, leading to a lung coagulopathy driven by increased thrombin generation and bronchoalveolar depression of fibrinolysis [41, 42] .

These cytokines promote release of ultralarge VWF multimers, production of TF and FVII/FVIIa leading to increased thrombin generation, and decrease levels of endogenous anticoagulants such as tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), antithrombin, and activated protein C [43] . The extensive interplay between endothelial cells, platelets, M\u00f8, PMNs, the complement system and the coagulation system results in a hypercoagulable state with increased levels of procoagulants, decreased levels of anticoagulants, and depressed fibrinolysis. Though elevated D-dimers are reported in patients with severe COVID-19, we suspect this reflects the significant imbalance in thrombin generation and fibrinolysis, especially in the pulmonary vasculature. In both general ARDS and sepsis, significant evidence supports a procoagulatory state characterized by massive thrombin production [44] . More specific to coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-1 was shown to upregulate hfgl2 prothrombinase gene, which may further contribute to thrombin generation and hypercoagulable state in COVID-19 [45] .",

Hypoxemia triggers increased expression of hypoxia inducible factors (HIF). This may promote further inflammation, thus augmenting blood viscosity and contributing to worsen hypercoagulability.

In the abovementioned study, positive aCL IgA and a\u03b22GPI IgA/IgG were described (titers and assay method not provided). LAC was negative, and repeat aPL antibody testing was unavailable [50] .

How the kallikrein-bradykinin pathway would be altered by COVID-19 induced RAAS derangement is unclear. It can be assumed that an inflammatory response to COVID-19 would lead to increased bradykinin production (and hence increased tPA expression). However, elevated AngII would lead to increased aldosterone that may further enhance ACE activity, which converts bradykinin to inactive peptides, blunting the bradykinin-mediated tPA increase [64] . A hyperaldosterone state is suspected in severe COID-19 based on observations of hypokalemia [65] . Aldosterone levels have been shown to correlate with PAI-1 levels [66] . Moreover, aldosterone has also been shown to directly increase PAI-1 expression, especially in renal tissue [67] [68] [69] .",

ACE inhibitors (ACEi) have been shown to improve endothelial function and have been suggested to be associated with less severe COVID-19 disease [54, 70] . Interestingly, ACEi have been shown to lower PAI-1 levels and increase release of tPA via elevated bradykinin [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] . On the other hand, AT1 receptor blockers (ARBs) have been shown to have a variable effect on PAI-1 (increase [76] , decrease [77] , or no change [78, 79] ) and do not increase levels of tPA [74] . Spironolactone, an aldosterone receptor blocker, has been shown to decrease PAI-1 levels [66, 80] . In a one week study, spironolactone (aldosterone receptor blocker) treatment in hypertensive patients significantly reduced PAI-1 levels and increased tPA levels compared to baseline [80] . However, other studies found no significant changes [81] . The differences between these studies highlight the complexity of the RAAS, with differences in volume status and the degree of RAAS activation as contributing factors [80, 81] . The combined effects of RAAS on both the pulmonary system and hemostasis make it a tantalizing target in COVID-19, but requires urgent further investigation to confirm these hypotheses and identify optimal therapeutic targets [53, 54] .",

Platelet hyper-reactivity, hypercoagulability, hypofibrinolysis, complement overactivation, and RAAS derangement in the presence of underlying inflammatory-induced endothelial dysfunction likely lead to a state of COVID-induced coagulopathy. Fortunately, modern medicine has left us with a multitude of therapeutic options for targeting all of the pathways discussed, if the components driving disease can be identified. Immunomodulation (including cytokine inhibitors and complement inhibitors), RAAS inhibitors, anticoagulants, antiplatelets and fibrinolytics may all serve potential roles in COVID-19 therapy. As such, rapid investigation is required to determine which pathways and components are deranged and most contributory to morbidity and mortality in COVID-19. Through multi-center studies and international collaboration, we aim to quickly answer these questions and enable targeted therapeutic monitoring and intervention. Fig. 2 . Potential interactions between renin angiotensin system, bradykinin system and fibrinolysis in severe COVID-19. Arrows demonstrate interactions. Italic script depicts the function of the molecule/enzyme in a normal state. The color of the arrows demonstrate how SARS-CoV-2 may influence their function. Green solid arrow means that the process (in italics) is enhanced in COVID-19, while red dashed arrow means that the process (in italics) is suppressed in COVID-19. As an example, in COVID-19 decreased ACE2 increases AngII, which increases aldosterone, which augments ACE expression, causing increased breakdown of bradykinin, thereby preventing the normal bradykinin-mediated increase in tPA).
