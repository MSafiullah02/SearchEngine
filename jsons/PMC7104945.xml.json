            "text": "\nToona sinensis (A. Juss.) Roem (Meliaceae), a perennial deciduous arbour, is widely distributed in eastern Asia (Edmonds & Staniforth, 1998). The leaves of T. \nsinensis, which contain a distinct flavour, are very popular in vegetarian cuisine and have long been used as a nutritious food in China and Malaysia and as animal fodder in India (Chen, Liang, Huang, & Huang, 2015). Almost every part of T. \nsinensis, including seeds, bark, root bark, petioles, and especially leaves, has a medicinal effect (Chang et al., 2006). The bark is used as astringent and depurative substance, the powdered root is used as a corrective, and the fruits are applied for the treatment of eye infection and used as an astringent. Leaves possess anti-inflammatory, antidoting, and worm-killing effects and are used in folk medicine to treat enteritis, dysentery, carbuncles, boils, dermatitis, scabies, tinea blanca, and especially abdominal tumours (Hsiang et al, 2013, Malairajan et al, 2007). Previous pharmacological and bioactivity studies on the extract of T. \nsinensis leaves have revealed anti-cancer (Chen, Chien, Huang, & Chia, 2014), anti-sepsis (Yang, Chen, Tsai, Huang, & Wang, 2014), antimicrobial (Wu et al., 2014), antinociceptive (Su et al., 2015), anti-inflammation (Hseu et al., 2011), anti-diabetes (Hsieh et al., 2012), antioxidant (Chen, Huang, Lin, Hsu, & Chung, 2013), and \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory activities (Zhao, Zhou, Chen, & Wang, 2009). T. \nsinensis leaf extract inhibits microglia-mediated neuroinflammation (Wang, Tsai, Hsieh, Lin, & Lin, 2014), Leydig cell steroidogenesis (Poon, Leu, Hsu, Liu, & Huang, 2005) and severe acute respiratory syndromes (SARS) coronavirus replication (Chen et al., 2008). It also inhibits lipid accumulation and fatty acid oxidation in adipocytes (Liu, Tsai, & Chang, 2014). The safety profile and nonmutagenic characteristics of the extracts from T. \nsinensis have been evaluated using acute and sub-acute toxicity studies in mice and rat (Liao, Yeh, Lin, Wei, & Chung, 2009). Because of the pharmacological properties of T. \nsinensis leaves, the study of the chemical composition has been of particular interest. Currently, phytochemical studies have shown the presence of limonoids, flavonoids, phytols, coumarins and norcysteine derivative (Cheng et al., 2009). However, these studies mainly focus on the high polar extracts and volatile compounds. To find more pharmacologically and structurally interesting substances, the present investigation led to ten new limonoids, toonasinenines A\u2013J (1\u201310), and 2 known compounds, toonafolin (11) and toonacilianin D (12) (Fig. 1\n). The structures of these compounds were elucidated mainly by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic and mass spectroscopic (MS) methods. Furthermore, all the limonoids were evaluated in vitro for their radical scavenging, anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic potential.",

NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AM-400 spectrometer. The coupling constants (J) were in Hz and chemical shift values (\u03b4) were given in ppm with TMS as internal standard. ESI-MS and HR-ESI-MS spectra were obtained on an Esquire 3000plus (Bruker Daltonics) and a Finnigan LC QDECA instrument. Column chromatographic separations were performed with silica gel (200\u2013300 mesh and H60, Qingdao Haiyang Chemical Group Corporation, China), MCI gel CHP20P (75\u2013150 \u00b5m, Mitsubishi Chemical Industries, Tokyo, Japan), and Sephadex LH-20 (Pharmacia Biotech AB, Uppsala, Sweden) as packing materials. TLC was carried out on precoated silica gel GF254 plates (Yantai Chemical Industries, Yantai, China). The TLC spots were visualised using 5% sulphuric acid in alcohol containing 10 mg/mL vanillin and viewed at 254 nm. Analytical HPLC was performed on a Waters 2690 instrument with a 996 PAD (photodiode array detector) with an Alltech ELSD 2000 detector. Semipreparative and preparative HPLC was carried out on a Varian SD1 instrument coupled with a 320 single-wave detector. Their chromatographic separations were taken on C-18 columns (250 \u00d7 10 mm, 5 \u00b5m, Waters, Massachusetts, USA; 220 \u00d7 25 mm, 10 \u00b5m, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany, respectively), with a gradient solvent system composed of MeOH and H2O, using a flow rate of 3.0 and 15.0 mL/min, respectively.",

            "text": "Compound 1 was obtained as a white amorphous powder. Its molecular formula was deduced as C29H38O9 by HR-ESI-MS spectrum, corresponding to 11 unsaturation degrees. The 1H NMR spectrum of 1 exhibited the presence of resonances for a methoxy proton at \u03b4\nH 3.78 (s), four tertiary methyls [\u03b4\nH 1.02, 1.05, 1.08, and 1.25 (each 3H, s)], one oxygenated methylene at \u03b4\nH 4.77 and 4.41, three characteristic protons attached to a carbon adjacent to an oxygen atom [\u03b4\nH 3.46 (s), 3.80 (dd, J = 11.4, 5.0 Hz) and 3.95 (m)], and a \u03b2-substituted furan ring group [\u03b4\nH 6.21 (br s), 7.15 (br s), and 7.41 (s)]. Analyses of its 13C NMR spectrum displayed 29 carbon resonances due to six methyl (one oxygenated), five sp3 methylene (one oxygenated), nine methine (three oxygenated and three olefinic), seven quaternary (one ketone and one olefinic), and two ester carbonyl carbons. These functionalities (two double bonds and three cabonyl) accounted for 5 out of the 11 degrees of unsaturation. The remaining 6 degrees of unsaturation required 1 to be hexacyclic. Strong HMBC correlations of H-12 (\u03b4\nH 2.44 and 1.62), H-16 (\u03b4\nH 2.28 and 1.81), H-17 (\u03b4\nH 2.76), and H-30 (\u03b4\nH 1.25) with C-14 (\u03b4\nC 74.3) and H-17 with C-15 (\u03b4\nC 54.9) and C-21 (\u03b4\nC 139.3) clearly indicated the five-membered ring D to have a 14,15-epoxy group. A ketone carbon resonance (\u03b4\nC 208.8) was assigned to C-3 as judged from the HMBC correlations of Me-28/C-3 and Me-29/C-3. The oxygen bridge could then be located between C-1 and C-11 due to the HMBC correlation of H-1 (\u03b4\nH 3.80) with C-3 and C-9 (\u03b4\nC 63.5) and of H-11 (\u03b4\nH 3.95) with C-10 (\u03b4\nC 49.0) and C-13 (\u03b4\nC 41.6), which was further confirmed by the correlations of H-1/H-2 and H-9/H-11/H-12 in 1H-1H COSY spectrum. These spectral evidences indicated that 1 might be a ring B-seco limonoid bearing the same C, D and E rings with a 14\u03b2,15\u03b2-epoxide identical with toonafolin (11) (Liu et al., 2012), obtained also from the same plant source. The only significant difference between 1 and toonafolin was the presence of an acetyl group at C-29 in\n1, which was further confirmed by the HMBC correlation of the oxygenated methylene protons at \u03b4\nH 4.77 and 4.41 (H-29) with the carbonyl carbon (\u03b4\nC 169.8) of the acetyl group. On the basis of the observation of ROESY data similar to those of 11, the stereochemistry of 1 was expected to be the same. Ring A should be nearer to a chair conformation, in which H-1 and H3-19 are eclipsed which was supported by ROESY correlations of H-1\u03b2 (\u03b4\nH 3.80) with H-2\u03b2 (\u03b4\nH 2.66) and H3-19 (\u03b4\nH 1.08). The ROESY correlations of H-1/H-2\u03b2, H-1/H3-19\u03b2, H-11/H3-19\u03b2, H-11/H-12\u03b2, and H-11/H3-30\u03b2 suggested that H-1 and H-11 were \u03b2-orientated. Moreover, the existence of a correlation from H3-19\u03b2 to H-11 (\u03b4\nH 3.95) confirmed that H-11 is in the \u03b2- and the oxide ring in the \u03b1-configuration. The configuration of the 14,15-epoxide was deduced by NMR spectroscopic comparison with 1 and 11, which showed similar chemical shifts and proton coupling patterns. Consequently, compound 1 was unambiguously determined as toonasinenine A.",

These data established that one \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl group was located at C-1, C-2 and C-3.

The 1H and 13C NMR data (Table 1) of compound 5 showed many similarities to those of 12-deacetoxytoonacilin, indicating that they are structural analogues with the only difference being the presence of OH-6 in 5 (Liu et al., 2012). This was confirmed by the HMBC correlations of H-6 (\u03b4\nH 4.61) to C-4 (\u03b4\nC 59.5) and C-10 (\u03b4\nC 42.0), and of OMe (\u03b4\nH 3.67) to C-7 (\u03b4\nC 178.4). The \u03b2-oriented configuration of the OH at C-6 in 5 was deduced by comparing the chemical shifts of H-6 and C-6, and the coupling pattern with its analogues 12-deacetoxytoonacilin and substantiated by its ROESY spectrum. On the basis of these results, the structure of 5 can be represented as toonasinenine E.",

Comparison of NMR data of 6 and toonacilianin D (12) indicated that they were similar in structure, except that signal due to C-6 was shifted downfield to \u03b4\nC 72.8 in 6, suggesting that there should be a hydroxy group located at C-6 (Liu et al., 2011). This deduction was further confirmed by the cross-peaks between H-6 (\u03b4\nH 4.42), and C-4 and C-10 in the HMBC spectrum. The other three hydroxyl groups were placed on C-3 (\u03b4\nC 74.0), C-8 (\u03b4\nC 78.0), and C-12 (\u03b4\nC 77.2), respectively, by the key HMBC correlations of H3-28 and H3-29 to C-3, of H-11 and H-15 to C-8, and of H-12 to C-9, C-14, and C-17, respectively. The ROESY correlations from both H3-28 and H3-29 to H-3 indicated gauche relationships of H3-28/H-3 and H3-29/H-3, and that H-3 was thus equatorial and towards the \u03b2-face. The strong ROESY correlations of H3-30/H-11\u03b2 and H-12/H-17\u03b2 unambiguously indicated the \u03b2-configurations of H-12 and H3-30. Thus, the structure of 6 was established as depicted.",

The above evidence showed that compound 9 was a tetranortriterpenoid sharing some similarity to toonayunnanin E (Liu et al., 2012). The NMR difference indicated that the acetyl group at C-6 in toonayunnanin E was replaced by a hydroxyl group in 9, which was further confirmed by the upfield shift of C-6 to 70.1 in 9 and the HMBC correlations of H-6 (\u03b4\nH 4.69) with C-4 (\u03b4\nC 83.6) and C-10 (\u03b4\nC 49.1).

Due to their intrinsic structural variety, we were interested in establishing that \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketone moiety in the ring A, capable of donating an electron and hydrogen atom by resonance hybrid and keto-enol Keto-enol tautomerisation, may strengthen the actions of radical scavenging character. Compounds 4 exhibited more significant antiradical activities on radicals of ABTS\u22c5+ than on DPPH assays, which may be elucidated by the mechanism difference that the ABTS\u22c5+ reactions involve electron transfer and take place at a much faster rate compared to DPPH radicals. 4 possesses high amount of phoenols which can take part in electron transfer and hydrogen atom transfer reactions with many oxidising free radicals.
