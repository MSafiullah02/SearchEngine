A major deficiency in global health and the entire IHR process has been the failure to recognize the importance of zoonotic diseases-those diseases that can be passed from animals to humans. World-wide, zoonotic diseases represent 61% of all diseases and an alarming 71% of new diseases. Second only to war, zoonotic epidemics have killed more humans than any other disease. Today, it is known that climate change, overuse of antibiotics, and more intensified farming are thought to also be increasing the rate of zoonotic diseases globally. 5 My first experience in zoonotic disease was in 1968 during the Vietnam War. That year, South Vietnam witnessed the largest bubonic plague epidemic of the 20 th century. Indeed, that outbreak temporarily paused the war on both sides of the conflict and emptied small villages and larger city streets. It prompted me to educate myself on the massive influence zoonotic diseases have on the environment and public health. For many of my generation of physicians, Sir William Osler remains a crucial role model, famous for his writings and for taking the teaching of medicine out of the classroom to the bedside. Few know that he taught at both medical and veterinarian colleges, advancing the basic knowledge of veterinary pathology and zoonotic diseases, or those that commonly spread from non-human animals to humans. Osler's work advanced the understanding of today's infectious disease outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics. It was a veterinarian, Calvin Schwabe, schooled under Osler's teachings and now recognized as the father of veterinary epidemiology, who first coined the term \"One Medicine\" as the science of health and disease in which \"differences between humans and animals are not considered.\" 6 Schwabe pointed out that most infectious diseases of humans have an animal origin that incorporated the \"inclusion of environmental health, as opposed to simply medical treatment\" 7 into the crucial management of major infectious diseases such as SARS, H1N1, and today's COVID- 19. In his 1906 book Aequanimitus, Osler emphasized that medicine is the \"only world-wide profession following the same methods, actuating the same ambitions, and pursuing the same ends.\" He emphasized that this \"homogeneity\" or \"solidarity\" which physicians world-wide are witnessing today with the COVID-19 pandemic is a quality \"not shared by law\" or politics, that \"allows physicians to practice the same art amid the same surroundings in every country on earth.\" 8 This unity of effort is not seen in other professions, and is witnessed today with the wide support given by medical colleagues from other countries, all cooperating on essential clinical and public health research.",

Increasingly, the process revealed that the power of governments to shape national policy was, in many cases, being considerably limited and diminished by an increasingly competitive international economy where some countries impacted by globalization either thrived or collapsed. 13 Global health experts, and those focusing on humanitarian and crisis management, who were excluded from any cross-cultural economic debates, closely watched from afar how and where public health infrastructure and protections in water, shelter, food, and availability of health services would either benefit or suffer from globalization. Too often, local public health and the global health priorities they impacted took a backseat to economic demands resulting in \"weakening of life-supporting systems,\" specifically \"altered composition of the atmosphere, land degradation, depletion of terrestrial aquifers and ocean fisheries, and loss of biodiversity.\" 14 These are elements known today that can lead to acquiring and spreading of epidemic infections such as SARS, H1N1, and Influenza. Health and public health were never at the same globalization negotiating table, but were more often silently relegated to a catchup role that tried to mitigate the impact on health caused by increasing globalization. With increasing globalization and speed of transportation, infections rapidly began migrating across borders. Yet WHO, now equipped with improved telecommunications, developed an increased capacity to readily detect emerging epidemics, a major improvement never before available with previous epidemics and pandemics.",

Spreading conspiracy theories from China, Russia, and the United States is rampant, all systems designed to deflect responsibility for their bureaucratic failures. China is now seeking to blame the United States for COVID-19 claiming, \"further evidence that the virus originated in the US\" and was planted in China by the US Army. Russia is sowing divisions between and within Western countries to undermine public confidence in government competence and integrity. 21 The WHO, despite having in-hand evidence to the contrary, failed to properly contain the COVID-19 pandemic. China's gross denial and failure to investigate and alert other nations is inexcusable. Moreover, its malignant behavior toward clinicians and researchers who warned the government of the outbreak, when the virus was first known as far back as October of 2019, is equally inexcusable. Yet the February 16-24, 2020 \"Report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019\" singularly praised China's response as the best source of medical technology to deal with the pandemic. China then declared that their singular success in controlling the pandemic should qualify them to take over the WHO. 22 While the European Union and the United States struggle to control the COVID-19 pandemic, WHO fully supports China's \"One Belt, One Road\" initiative across Africa to improve the economy of the continent. However, the lessons from globalization prove that economic prosperity alone cannot be achieved when huge knowledge and capacity gaps exist in health systems, especially public health and health information systems. There is a need for public health initiatives aimed at strengthening the health systems beyond sovereign borders to influence global geo-economics. 23 Whereas WHO has fully supported this initiative with claims that China is investing in \"people's health outside its border,\" the deplorable cover-up, response, and management of COVID-19 for many months before it was known to the world questions whether China is up to the public health challenges it claims in Africa, or fully understands the vital connections economic development has with public health. China claims that ruling Africa's economy is a necessary prelude to the \"next phase of globalization.\" 24 Ever since WHO first announced the presence of clusters of unknown pneumonia on December 31, 2019, an alarming concern has surfaced that WHO has become beholden to influential countries for funding support, giving wealthy UN members, especially China, support and influence both before and during the coronavirus outbreak. For example, WHO's position regarding China has renewed a longstanding debate about whether WHO, founded 72 years ago, is sufficiently independent to allow it to fulfill its purpose. 25 Critics raised questions concerning WHO's response over how \"China's sway over the WHO is its success in blocking Taiwan's access to the body, a position that could have very real consequences for the Taiwanese people if the virus takes hold there.\" Others cite that WHO \"downplayed the harsh control of medical whistleblowers,\" and the critical delay in revealing COVID's presence, and further argue that WHO is \"overly bureaucratic, bizarrely structured, too dependent on a handful of major donors, and often hamstrung by political concerns.\" 26 With the COVID-19 crisis, \"the state of politics and geopolitics has exacerbated, not stabilized, the crisis.\" 27 This applies to many countries, especially China, the United States, Japan, Cambodia, Iran, and South Korea. Authors cite former WHO consultant Charles Clift who observed, as have many former insiders, that WHO \"is too politicized, too bureaucratic, too dominated by medical staff seeking medical solutions to what are often social and economic problems, and too timid in approaching controversial issues, too overstretched, and too slow to adapt to change.\" He added that WHO, being \"both a technical agency and a policymaking body, that excessive intrusion of political considerations in its technical work can damage its authority and credibility as a standard-bearer for health.\" 25, 28 United States' President Trump has not done better in what must be a coordinated world response. His idea of \"America first and national populism\" is against everything that we believe in global health. 29 In January 2019, China made available the \"genome\" of this mysterious new virus in hopes of producing the first diagnostic test for the disease, but the United States declined to use the WHO test even temporarily as a bridge until the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; Atlanta, Georgia USA) could produce its test. This action remains a perplexing question and the key to the Trump administration's failure to provide enough tests to identify the coronavirus infection, needlessly slowing the critical domestic testing process and surveillance. 30 Additionally, President Trump's reliance on the validity of his \"hunches,\" claimed WHO's mortality rate was \"false,\" irresponsibly valuing his \"best guesses over scientific analysis.\" This has led to a \"false sense of security that endangers public health.\" 31 Both China and the United States have public health infrastructure and service deficiencies that have gone unattended for decades. Public health infrastructure in the United States makes up only three percent of health care spending focused on prevention and public health, while 75% of health care costs are related to preventable conditions. 32 China chronically suffers low public health standards in toilets, restaurants, hospitals, and meat markets; and the United States has 50 states and 55 very different health department ratings. 33 As an example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Mississippi, which rates last in public health infrastructure, has created confusion with many of its mayors claiming the need for curfews and closing of businesses, only to be over-ridden by the State's governor. 34 The Only Solution The WHO must exist solely as a treaty-based organization sanctioned by the UN and all its members. It cannot be dependent on outside financial assistance to do its work. The unique characteristics of propagating zoonotic diseases must be better known by both the medical profession and governmental decision makers. Health care experts, as Osler described, must be in charge of all health decisions, monitoring, response, and operational research. They cannot abdicate any responsibilities to individual nationstates nor be beholden to them or well-financed donors for support.",
