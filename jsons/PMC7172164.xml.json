There were about 11 classes of cathepsins in humans [2], which have now increased to 15, as presented in Table 1\n. These enzymes are active in the low pH milieu of lysosomes and are versatile in their functions. Like other enzymes, they are vital for the normal physiological functions such as digestion, blood coagulation, bone resorption, ion channel activity, innate immunity, complement activation, apoptosis, vesicular trafficking, autophagy, angiogenesis, proliferation, and metastasis, among scores of others [3,4]. Autophagy is a protective process involving lysosomal degradation of misfolded proteins [5,6]. But it becomes an adversary when equilibrium is broken. Numerous pathologies have been attributed to the dysregulated cathepsins, some of which include arthritis, periodontitis, pancreatitis, macular degeneration, muscular dystrophy, atherosclerosis, obesity, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, tuberculosis, and Ebola.",

They are expressed on different cells throughout the body such as dermal fibroblasts, among others. The preferences of certain cathepsins on specific cells such as microglia cells, erythrocytes, lymphocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, lungs, Langerhans cells, epithelium of gastrointestinal tract, urinary bladder, osteoclasts, spleen, thymus, dermal fibroblasts, etc. have been observed. Though a number of cathepsins might be working in tandem or in synchrony for a function, some tissue-specific cathepsins have been reported. For example, Cathepsin E is expressed on a broad range of immune cells [8], cathepsin K on skin fibroblasts [9], and cathepsin L only in the placenta [10]. However, these inferences could be only the limitations of experimental knowledge or even be misleading. A publication reports that Cathepsin L is found in the thymus as well [11]. With changing pH and inflammatory state, the cathepsin expression profiles are likely to be changing.",

All isoforms of the cathepsin exert proteolytic activity, but they favor specific pH. Different pH conditions lead to various protonation states of amino acid residues of the cathepsins. Neutral pH can attenuate cathepsin activity, while alkaline pH can lead to the inactivation of cathepsins [13]. The accurate pH determination of cathepsins is cumbersome, as several factors influence it. Cathepsin B activity is acidic pH-dependent, the pH 5.6 favoring its gelatinase activity. Whereas vesicle-associated cathepsin B showed 1300-fold higher activity at acidic pH values compared to the physiological pH 7.4, the cells extract cathepsin B showed 33-fold higher activity at acidic pH values compared to the physiological pH 7.4 [14]. Cathepsin L has a pH range of 3.5\u20136. Cysteine cathepsins like B and L are located in the acidic compartments of cells [3].",

            "text": "The protein encoded by SNX10 (Sorting Nexin 10) plays an essential role in endosomal trafficking and chaperone-mediated autophagy [15]. It mediates cathepsin A maturation, playing essential roles in alcohol-induced liver injury and steatosis. Cathepsin A causes the inactivation of bioactive peptides such as bradykinin, substance P, oxytocin, angiotensin I and endothelin-I. The role of this enzyme in galactosialidosis has come forth [16]. Cathepsin A can inhibit autophagy [5,6]. Cathepsin B promotes amyloid plaque [17], and various carcinomas [18]. This enzyme is instrumental in both basal and EGF (epidermal growth factor)-stimulated lung cancer cell migration. Prorenin, the precursor of kidney-secreted hormone renin, can be activated by cathepsin B [19]. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is critical for the homeostasis of plasma sodium concentration, and vascular tonicity i.e. blood pressure. RAAS activation underlies numerous pathologies [20]. Cathepsin B from amoeba can cleave several human proteins including immunoglobulins (IgA, IgG, IgM), hemoglobin, collagen, fibronectin, and albumin [21]. Cathepsin D cleaves fibronectin and laminin. A number of breast cancer biomarkers have been identified, among which cathepsin D is one [22]. Cathepsin D can express on desmosomes, the intercellular junctions, causing desquamation [23]. Cathepsin E is frequently implicated in antigen processing via the MHC class II pathway [8]. Cathepsin F has been detected in helminthic pathogens as liver fluke Opisthorchis viverrini (known to cause cholangiocarcinoma) [24], as well as hepatobiliary trematodes such as Clonorchis sinensis, Paragonimus westermani, Schistosoma mansoni. Trichinell aspp. (known to cause trichinellosis) [25]. Kufs disease, an adult-onset neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis occurs due to polymorphism in CTSF gene, which encodes cathepsin F [26]. The regulatory role of cathepsin in cancer is implicated, but much remains elusive. Lung granulomas where Mycobacterium tuberculosis survives, is rich in cathepsin G [27]. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), the conglomerate of DNA, histones, serine proteases (such as neutrophil elastase, cathepsin G), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and proteinase 3 are released from the human granulocytes when an inflammatory signal is perceived [28,29]. NETs attempt to inhibit the pathogens, but the microbial virulence factors such as bacterial nucleases can degrade NET [30]. Cathepsin K is highly effective in degrading collagens [31]. Type I collagen, the major component of the organic bone matrix, is dissolved by this cathepsin, so this enzyme is essential for normal bone resorption [32]. However, its imbalance causes osteoporosis, arthritis, and cancer metastasis. These bone metabolism anomalies occur due to the degradation of organic matrix by cathepsin K. Cathepsin K also degrades gelatin, the latter being a hydrolysis product of collagen. A study found that the disruption of cathepsin K resulted in defective Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR 9) signaling in dendritic cells [33]. So, the scope of this cathepsin as a therapeutic target in autoimmune diseases was proposed. Polymorphism in the cathepsin K-encoding gene is responsible for pycnodysostosis, an autosomal recessive bone disease [34]. Cathepsin L degrades fibronectin, insulin receptor, and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R). Coronaviruses use cathepsin L, apart from angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), to infect humans [35]. Cathepsin L is involved in the biosynthesis of a wide-range of neuropeptides [36]. Among others, enkephalin, \u03b2-endorphin, dynorphin, ACTH, \u03b1-MSH, NPY, CCK etc. are processed by this cathepsin. Cathepsin L deficiency leads to chromatin structure anomaly which is related to its interaction with histones [2]. Some cathepsins, including cathepsin L, are only expressed in the placenta [10]. It is becoming increasingly evident that in cancer progression, not only the tumor cells, but also the cells in its vicinity play decisive role. The microenvironmental stimuli can promote angiogenesis, invasiveness, and proliferation [37,38]. It has come forth that apart from tumor cells, tumor-associated macrophages and endothelial cells can produce cathepsin S, which promotes neovascularization and tumor growth [39]. Cathepsin V (or L2), an elastase, is involved in cancer invasion and metastasis as well [40].",

ECM, apart from providing support to the tissues [53], is critical for tissue integrity, gene expression, and immune homeostasis, among other functions. The activated proteases such as metalloproteinases (MMPs), and other proteases degrade ECM and lead to its remodeling [[53], [54], [55]]. ECM breakdown products act as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) for the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes [56]. Cathepsins degrade low-density lipoprotein (LDL-P) and attenuate cholesterol efflux from macrophages, leading to foam cell formation [55]. The foam cells are responsible for atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease. Fibrosis and cancer, among other inflammatory diseases, are the resultant of perturbed ECM [50].",

The inhibitors can be of endogenous, or exogenous origin, and are natural or synthetic. The section below outline some cathepsin inhibitors. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are amphiphilic molecules of \u2018defense and offense\u2019 functions [69]. AMPs are present in all living organisms, and they protect the host by eliciting immunogenicity against other organisms [69]. Hevein, an AMP in the latex of Hevea brasiliensis (rubber plant) have the chitin-binding domains (ChtBDs) [[70], [71], [72]]. Other plant AMPs of pathogenic relevance include knottins, which encompass lectins, amylase inhibitors, and thionins, among others [69]. Arthropod AMPs like formaecin, drosocin, apidaecin, abaecin, metchnikowin, lebocin, pyrrhocoricin and metalnikowin are proline-rich [73]. Predominant AMPs in humans include defensins, cathelicidins, histatins etc. [[74], [75], [76]]. Several of the AMPs are inhibitors of proteases, including the cathepsins [77]. Cystatin family AMPs, which encompass statherins, histatins, and proline rich proteins (PRPs), and they can inhibit cathepsins B, H and L etc. [78]. Stefin B or cystatin B inhibits cathepsin L [79] as well as other proteases [80]. Histatins in saliva inhibits pathogenic fungi Candida albicans by binding to the fungal cell wall proteins and glycans, subsequently being internalized by fungal polyamine transporters, imposing oxidative stress, and hampering mitochondrial functions, perturbing ionic balance and eventually killing the fungi [76]. Kininogen, another cystatin-related protein, a kinin precursor, has cystatin domains which can inhibit cysteine cathepsins [81]. Tasiamide B, a cyanobacterial peptide with a statin-like unit, inhibited cathepsin D and other aspartic proteases [82]. Cathepsin D activity is inhibited by \u03b12-macroglobulin [83]. This glycoprotein contains a receptor-binding domain, and is a major and broad spectrum protease inhibitor in the human body [83,84]. Cathepsins are competitively inhibited by glycosaminoglycans (dermatan sulfate and hyaluronan) [85]. A major glycosaminoglycan, chondroitin sulfate, inhibited cathepsins K and V, by forming complex with these proteases [41]. A study found that the removal of collagen-associated glycosaminoglycans prevented cathepsin K binding and subsequent collagen hydrolysis [31].",

            "text": "The physiological pH range prevents the activation of protease, glycosidase, urease, phospholipase, cyclooxygenase, aromatase, ATP synthase, and a whole array of other enzymes [99,100]. Low pH converts the pro-enzymes to their active forms. As low pH activates the enzyme, tissue remodelling, and gene expression changes occur, which pave the path for tumorigenesis [50]. Cathepsin-containing vesicles are expressed on cell surfaces. There are several approaches which can prevent the activation of cathepsins. Avoidance of infections, allergens, chemical cosmetics, processed foods, and pollutants can restore the normalcy of cathepsin level and function. The mechanism underlying the aberrant activation of cathepsins due to inflammation driven by above-mentioned factors has been explained briefly. Acidogenic attribute of modern foods are well-known. They might be tongue-tasty or easy-to-prepare, but they provoke pH fall, and abnormal enzyme activation. Acidosis induces MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) phosphorylation [101], and activates proton-sensing proteins (G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) as OGR1, GPR4, and TDAG8) which impedes actin polymerization/depolymerization [102,103]. Ion channels as the proton-gated sodium channels are manipulated, and the ionic perturbation leads to pain [[104], [105], [106]]. Perceiving that stressors are around, efflux proteins such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp) are expressed [[107], [108], [109], [110]]. The healthy aspect of Paleo diet, dominated by unprocessed foods, acts as a buffer towards pH fluctuation [111]. The ingestion of Nordic diet decreased cathepsin S levels in healthy individuals, by lowering LDL cholesterol [112]. Oral supplementation of Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactobacillus gasseri strains reduced the expression of cathepsin L in mice muscles, indicating decreased inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, monocyte chemo-attractant protein-1, and IL-4) [113].",
