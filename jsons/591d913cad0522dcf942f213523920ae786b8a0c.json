Since then, the disease has spread around the world reaching the pandemic stage, according to the WHO [1] , on March 11. The first cases were detected in France on January 24. The infection fatality ratio (IFR), defined as the number of deaths divided by the number of infected cases, is an important quantity that informs us on the expected number of casualties at the end of an epidemic, when a given proportion of the population has been infected. Although the data on the number of deaths from COVID-19 are probably accurate, the actual number of infected people in the population is not known. Thus, due to the relatively low number of screening tests that have been carried out in France (about 5 over 10, 000 people in France to be compared with 50 over 10, 000 in South Korea up to March 15, 2020 ; Sources: Sant Publique France and Korean Center for Disease Control) the direct computation of the IFR is not possible. Based on the PCR-confirmed cases in international residents repatriated from China on January 2020, [2] obtained an estimate of the infection fatality ratio (IFR) of 0.66% in China, and, adjusting for non-uniform attack rates by age, an IFR of 0.9% was obtained in the UK [3] .",

The actual number of infected individuals in France is probably much higher than the observations (we find here a factor \u00d78), which leads at a lower mortality rate than that calculated on the basis of the observed cases: we find here an IFR of 0.5% based on hospital death counting data, to be compared with a case fatality rate (CFR, number of deaths over number of diagnosed cases) of 2%. Adjusting for the number of deaths in the nursing homes, we obtained an IFR of 0.8%. These values for the IFR are consistent with the findings of [2] (0.66% in China), and slightly lower than the value of 0.9% previously obtained in the UK [3] . If the virus led to contaminate 80% of the French population [3] , the total number of deaths to deplore in the absence of variation in the mortality rate (increase induced for example by the saturation of hospital structures, or decrease linked to better patient care) would be 336, 000 (95%- CI : 192, 000 \u2212 537, 000), excluding the number of deaths in the nursing homes. This estimate could be corroborated or invalidated when 80% of the population will be infected, eventually over several years, assuming that an infected individual is definitively immunized. It has to be noted that measures of confinement or social distancing can decrease both the percentage of infected individuals in the population and the degree of saturation of hospital structures.",

This limit led us to use a particularly parsimonious model in order to avoid problems of identifiability for the parameters. The assumptions underlying the model are therefore relatively simple and the results must be interpreted with regard to these assumptions. For instance, the date of the introduction t 0 must be seen as an efficient date of introduction for a dynamics where a single introduction would be decisive for the outbreak and the other (anterior and posterior) introductions would have an insignificant effect on the dynamics.
