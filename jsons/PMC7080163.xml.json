The conjugation of carbohydrates is also useful to modify the functions and stability of target proteins. The advantage to synthesize neoglycoproteins is that chemically synthesized carbohydrates, not only natural, but also unnatural carbohydrates, can be coupled to proteins [1\u20134].",

In glycoproteins, sialic acid is usually conjugated with galactose and plays an important role in preventing the clearance of glycoproteins from the serum because asialoglycoproteins are rapidly cleared through galactose binding lectins present in the liver [7]. Furthermore, sialic acid is also important as a ligand for selectins [8] and Siglecs [9] and is involved in cellular signaling events and the modulation of immune reactions. Therefore, it is expected that the coupling of sialic acid enables its conjugate to bind to a variety of cell types and prolong its serum level as well.",

At high doses, TNF\u03b1 induces acute responses such as shock, tissue injury, catabolic hormone release, vascular leakage syndrome, gastrointestinal necrosis, acute renal tube necrosis, adrenal hemorrhage, fever, and at low doses, chronic responses such as weight loss, anorexia, protein catabolism, lipid depletion, hepatosplenomegaly, subendocardial inflammation, insulin resistance, acute protein release and endothelial activation [11].",

Man2\u03b1 (1-6)-IL-1\u03b1 exhibited comparable activities to nonglycosylated IL-1\u03b1 in the down-regulation of the serum level of glucose and the recovery of peripheral white blood cells from myelosuppression in 5-fluorouracil-treated mice, irrespective of the decrease of all other activities in vivo [13]. In addition, the tissue distribution of Man2\u03b1 (1-6)-IL-1\u03b1 in mice differed from that of nonglycosylated IL-1\u03b1 [14]. d-Gal-conjugated IL-1\u03b1 exhibited a decrease in all the activities in vivo with a similar magnitude [16]. NeuAc coupled IL-1\u03b1 exhibited selective activities in vivo as Man2\u03b1 (1-6)-conjugated IL-1\u03b1 and enhanced tissue distribution [17\u201319].",

This is in contrast to its in vitro activities, in all the assays performed in vitro, including antiproliferative or cytotoxic activity to tumor cells, a proliferative effect on fibroblast cells, a stimulatory effect on IL-6 production by melanoma cells and NF-\u03baB activation in hepatocytes, NeuAc-TNF\u03b1 exhibited similarly reduced activities by about 1/3, as compared to native TNF\u03b1. It is interesting as to why the effects of NeuAc coupling to TNF\u03b1 activities in vivo differed according to the activities. The activities of TNF\u03b1 in vitro could be mainly determined by its affinity for the receptor. In contrast, the in vivo system is more complex, and the potency of TNF\u03b1 activity cannot be determined solely by the affinity to its receptor. In our previous studies, NeuAc-IL-1\u03b1 similarly exhibited reduced activities in all the assays performed in vitro, including its receptor binding affinity, as compared to native IL-1\u03b1, but in vivo, it exhibited selective activities, such as reduction in the activity to induce serum IL-6, moderate reduction in the activities to induce serum SAA and NOx, comparable activity to reduce the serum glucose level and augmented activity to improve the recovery of peripheral white blood cells from myelosuppression in 5-FU treated mice [18, 19].

            "text": "It is well established that TNF\u03b1 exerts its anti-tumor effect on the fibrosarcoma Meth-A in mice [10, 11, 29]. NeuAc-TNF\u03b1 inhibited the tumor growth more rapidly and efficiently than native TNF\u03b1. The rate of complete disappearance of the tumor was also higher in NeuAc-TNF\u03b1 as compared to native TNF\u03b1. As has been known, TNF\u03b1 caused hemorrhagic necrosis. Quite interestingly, however, NeuAc-TNF\u03b1 caused necrosis without hemorrhage. The tumor lesion was pale; subsequently, the tumor regressed and disappeared. It is of note that when the necrotic tumor lesion was touched by hand, the TNF\u03b1-injected mice, but not the NeuAc-TNF\u03b1 injected mice, became rowdy. Probably the TNF\u03b1-injected, but not the NeuAc-TNF\u03b1 injected mice, felt pain. TNF\u03b1 exerts its anti-tumor effect through its direct cytotoxic effect, necrosis or apoptosis, on tumor cells and also indirectly through host cells. TNF\u03b1 induces inflammatory exudates by inducing chemokines and cytokines, and augments the tumor cell killing activity of monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils and NK cells [10, 11]. It is also reported that TNF\u03b1 selectively stems blood flow in newly formed microcapillaries in the tumor lesion by inducing thrombus formation, leading to the autolysis of tumors [29]. Although the mechanism by which NeuAc-TNF\u03b1 caused necrosis without hemorrhage remained to be elucidated, our study indicated that conjugation of NeuAc to TNF\u03b1 rendered the conjugate more potent in anti-tumor effect and less toxic. The study also suggests that the site-directed conjugation of NeuAc will enable us to develop a more ideal TNF\u03b1 in future.",
