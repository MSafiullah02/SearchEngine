It is a chronic and incurable disease that significantly detracts from an individual's quality of life and imposes substantial cost burdens on patients, their families, healthcare systems, and society (Battaglia et al. 2000 ; Parise et al. 2013 ) . A diverse array of neurological signs and symptoms are associated with MS. These include limb weakness, impaired motor function, sensory symptoms, visual symptoms, eye movement disorders, bladder symptoms, sexual dysfunction, fatigue, ataxia, deafness, spasticity, dementia, and cognitive impairment (Rodgers et al. 1999 ) .

There are four distinct clinical courses in which the majority of MS patients can be classifi ed: relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) ; secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) ; primaryprogressive MS (PPMS) ; and progressive-relapsing MS (PRMS) (Lublin and Reingold 1996 ; Confavreux and Vukusic 2014 ) . About 80 % of people with MS are initially diagnosed with RRMS; this disease phenotype is characterized by disease exacerbations where new symptoms appear or existing symptoms become more severe (Markowitz 2013 ) . In RRMS, disease exacerbations last for variable amounts of time and are followed by periods of total or partial recovery. Disease in RRMS patients may be inactive for months or years. Approximately 65 % of individuals who are initially diagnosed with RRMS will develop SPMS characterized by the accumulation of progressive disability with or without superimposed relapses. On average, the time between disease onset and conversion from RRMS to SPMS occurs in 19 years (Rovaris et al. 2006 ) . The least common of the four major subtypes of MS, PRMS, describes those individuals who, from onset, have a steady neurologic decline but also have clear superimposed attacks (Lublin and Reingold 1996 ) . These forms of progressive MS are distinct from the primary-progressive form (PPMS) , which is characterized by a lack of discernible attacks. Individuals with PPMS experience a gradual onset of disease with a steady worsening of symptoms (Confavreux and Vukusic 2014 ; Karussis 2014 ) . In addition to the four major disease courses of MS, an international panel assembled in 2013 added clinically isolated syndrome ( CIS ; attack of demyelination that does not fulfi ll all criteria of MS) and radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) fi ndings suggestive of multiple sclerosis (MS) in asymptomatic/clinically silent patients) as MS phenotypes without changing the established framework four major disease courses (Lublin et al. 2014 ) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 464, "end": 491, "text": "(Lublin and Reingold 1996 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF192"}, {"start": 492, "end": 521, "text": "Confavreux and Vukusic 2014 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 719, "end": 736, "text": "(Markowitz 2013 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF202"}, {"start": 1208, "end": 1230, "text": "(Rovaris et al. 2006 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF264"}, {"start": 1409, "end": 1436, "text": "(Lublin and Reingold 1996 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF192"}, {"start": 1678, "end": 1708, "text": "(Confavreux and Vukusic 2014 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 1709, "end": 1724, "text": "Karussis 2014 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF156"}, {"start": 2186, "end": 2207, "text": "(Lublin et al. 2014 )", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Pathogenesis"}, {"text": "The onset of MS frequently occurs between the ages of 20 and 40 years and, like most autoimmune disorders, women are affected more often (1.5-2 times) than men (Karussis 2014 ) .

In recent years, however, there has been a marked increase in the number of children diagnosed with MS and it is now appreciated that pediatric-onset (defi ned here as disease onset prior to the age of 18) occurs in 2-5.6 % of all MS cases; indeed, this may have been the case for Lidwina of Schiedam Renoux et al. 2007 ; Chitnis et al. 2009 ; Ghezzi et al. 1997 ; Boiko et al. 2002 ; Banwell 2013 ) .

The worldwide distribution of MS is skewed with areas of lower prevalence in Asia, Africa, and South America and areas of high prevalence in North America, Europe, New Zealand, and Australia (Kurtzke 1995 ) . The incidence and prevalence of MS follows a northsouth gradient in both hemispheres with rates of 30-80 cases per 100,000 in northern Europe, southern Canada, and the northern United States, in contrast with rates of 6-20 per 100,000 in most of southern Europe and the southern United States (Sadovnick and Ebers 1993 ; Compston 1994 ; Ebers et al. 1995 ; Kurtzke 2005 ) . The north-south gradient observed in the New World is believed to refl ect the tendency of individuals from Northern Europe to migrate to the northern regions of the United States and Canada and, conversely, those from regions of Europe with a lower incidence of MS to migrate to southern regions of the United States and South America. It is important to note that the latitudinal gradient of MS prevalence is not absolute; exceptions include the low prevalence of MS in Eskimo populations and the high prevalence of MS (150 per 100,000) in Sardinia (Acers and Acers-Warn 1994 ; Montomoli et al. 2002 ; Cocco et al. 2011 ) .

For example, the frequency of MS is increased in Hungarians and Bulgarians of Caucasian decent compared to gypsy populations residing in the same regions (Kalman et al. 1991 ; Milanov et al. 1999 ) . A similar situation exists in Australia and New Zealand where those of European descent have a far higher risk of developing MS than the indigenous populations (Hammond et al. 1988 ; Miller et al. 1986 ). In the United States, the prevalence of MS among people of Japanese ancestry living on the Pacifi c Coast (6.7/100,000) is considerably lower than that of Caucasians living in California (30/100,000) (Visscher et al. 1977 ) . However, people of Japanese descent living on the West Coast of the United States have a slightly higher prevalence of MS than those living in Japan (2/100,000) suggesting that environmental factors infl uence disease susceptibility (Visscher et al. 1977 ) . Collectively, the observed variations in MS prevalence among specifi c ethnic groups suggest that genetic traits that confer MS susceptibility may be enriched in populations that are at higher risk for MS and that these traits may be rare in populations at lower risk for MS. Moreover, there are other factors (both cultural and environmental) that differ between these groups (e.g., diet and lifestyle) that could confound the interpretation of these epidemiologic studies (Cree 2014 ) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 372, "end": 393, "text": "(Kalman et al. 1991 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF153"}, {"start": 394, "end": 415, "text": "Milanov et al. 1999 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF210"}, {"start": 578, "end": 600, "text": "(Hammond et al. 1988 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF123"}, {"start": 601, "end": 619, "text": "Miller et al. 1986", "ref_id": "BIBREF211"}, {"start": 823, "end": 846, "text": "(Visscher et al. 1977 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF317"}, {"start": 1082, "end": 1105, "text": "(Visscher et al. 1977 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF317"}, {"start": 1582, "end": 1594, "text": "(Cree 2014 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Genetic Factors"}, {"text": "Family and twin studies also indicate that there is a strong genetic component in the development of MS. Adoption studies have demonstrated that biological relatives of patients with MS have a greater likelihood of developing MS than adoptees and, conversely, that family members of adopted individuals with MS do not have an increased risk of developing the disorder (Ebers et al. 1995 ) . The lifetime risk of MS increases with closer biological relationships. The risk is greatest for siblings of affected individuals, especially sisters, and decreases in half-siblings as well as second-and third-degree relatives (Sadovnick and Ebers 1993 ; Sadovnick et al. 1988 Sadovnick et al. , 1996 . Additionally, the rate of MS concordance is greater in monozygotic (18-30 %) than in dizygotic twins (3-5 %). The incomplete penetrance of MS among monozygotic twins clearly suggests that a susceptible genetic background alone is not suffi cient to cause disease (Bobowick et al. 1978 ; O'Gorman et al. 2013 ) . Of interest, the concordance rate for fraternal twins is less than that of identical twins, but greater than that of other fi rst-degree relatives of MS patients (Willer et al. 2003 ) . Because twins share the same intrauterine environment and similar postnatal environments, the large difference in concordance between monozygotic and dizygotic twins must, at least in part, be attributable to genetic factors. Moreover, the increased concordance rate of MS between dizygotic twins compared with non-twin siblings reinforces the view that environmental factors are also in play.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 368, "end": 388, "text": "(Ebers et al. 1995 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF92"}, {"start": 618, "end": 645, "text": "(Sadovnick and Ebers 1993 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF266"}, {"start": 646, "end": 667, "text": "Sadovnick et al. 1988", "ref_id": "BIBREF267"}, {"start": 668, "end": 691, "text": "Sadovnick et al. , 1996", "ref_id": "BIBREF268"}, {"start": 957, "end": 980, "text": "(Bobowick et al. 1978 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 981, "end": 1003, "text": "O'Gorman et al. 2013 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF227"}, {"start": 1168, "end": 1189, "text": "(Willer et al. 2003 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF322"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Genetic Factors"}, {"text": "The inheritance of MS susceptibility does not follow classic models of genetic inheritance. It is generally believed that MS is a complex heterogenous disorder, infl uenced by several genes, each exerting a relatively modest effect. These genes may act independently or epistatically on MS pathogenesis. Some genes may be involved in the induction of this complex disorder while others may be involved in disease progression, further complicating genetic studies in MS. Over the years, several genes, most of which are associated with immune function, myelin structure, or mitochondria have been tentatively associated with an increased risk of MS (He et al. 1998 ; Kellar-Wood et al. 1994 ; Reynier et al. 1999 ; Thompson et al. 1996 ) . Many of these associations have not been demonstrated consistently in different studies. However, a strong association between MS and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) was fi rst identifi ed in the 1970s (Jersild et al. 1975 ) . Specifi cally, an increased risk of MS in individuals with MHC class II alleles DR2 and DQw1 has been found consistently in several populations (Cook 1997 ) ; in the preponderance of these studies the primary risk allele for MS is HLA-DRB1*15. Recently, additional high-risk MHC and non-MHC loci have been identifi ed through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) comparing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in affected and non-affected individuals (Australia and New Zealand Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium 2009 ; De Jager et al. 2009 ; Sawcer and Hellenthal 2011 ; International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium et al. 2007 ). Interestingly, the majority of the loci associated with MS risk have known immunologic functions and many contribute to the risk of inheriting other autoimmune diseases (Cree 2014 ) .

Historically, a T helper-1 (Th-1)-mediated autoimmune component driven by myelin protein-specifi c, pro-infl ammatory cytokine secreting CD4+ T cells was believed to mediate the pathogenesis of this disorder. However, more recent evidence suggests that CD8+ T cells , macrophages, B cells, and the innate immune system also play important roles in the infl ammatory cascade that results in demyelination and axonal loss in MS (Hoftberger et al. 2004 ; David and Lacroix 2003 ; Kotter et al. 2005 ; Prinz et al. 2006 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 831, "end": 856, "text": "(Hoftberger et al. 2004 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF131"}, {"start": 857, "end": 881, "text": "David and Lacroix 2003 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF80"}, {"start": 882, "end": 902, "text": "Kotter et al. 2005 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF166"}, {"start": 903, "end": 920, "text": "Prinz et al. 2006", "ref_id": "BIBREF247"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Immune Factors"}, {"text": "As described above, the MHC class II background of an individual is important in disease susceptibility.

The vast majority of studies concerning MHC-peptide interactions relevant to MS have focused on myelin basic protein (MBP) as an antigenic peptide. MBPspecifi c T cells have been demonstrated in the peripheral blood of both MS patients and normal individuals. The frequencies of MBP-specifi c T cells tend to be higher in MS patients than controls. However, similar frequencies of MBP-specifi c T cells have been demonstrated in affected and unaffected family members, thereby suggesting that the frequency of MBP-specifi c T cells may be linked to the immunogenetic background of an individual and may be a prerequisite, rather than a consequence, of disease development (Joshi et al. 1993 ) . Molecular mimicry, a phenomenon by which environmental antigens cross-react with normal host cell components, may induce an immune response against host proteins such as MBP. Therefore, individuals with higher frequencies of MBP reactive T cells may be more likely to develop autoreactive T cell responses as a result of environmental, non-self epitopes mimicking MBP.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 385, "end": 405, "text": "(Greer et al. 1996 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF116"}, {"start": 1080, "end": 1100, "text": "(Joshi et al. 1993 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF152"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Immune Factors"}, {"text": "Although the vast majority of studies have examined autoreactive CD4+ T cells , CD8+ T cells and B cells may also play a critical role in the neuropathogenesis of MS .

One of the hallmarks of MS is the intrathecal synthesis of oligoclonal antibodies. Oligoclonal bands (OCBs) and elevated IgG/albumin indices are found in the CSF of greater than 90 % of MS patients and can be used in the diagnosis of the disease . OCBs are not typically directed against a single antigen and antibody bands specifi c for viral bacterial, and self-antigens have been described (Sindic et al. 1994 ; Sriram et al. 1999 ; Virtanen et al. 2014 ; Franciotta et al. 2011 ) . Therefore, it is unclear whether or not the intrathecal synthesis of immunoglobulins observed in MS results from the presence of cells that are actively recruited into the CNS after the pathogenetically relevant cells crossed the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In addition to the presence of OCBs , other immunological markers of disease activity have been described in MS. Several proinfl ammatory cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, and osteopontin, are upregulated in MS (Chabas et al. 2001 ) . Treatment of MS patients with IFN-\u03b3 resulted in a marked increase in exacerbations, supporting the model of MS as an infl ammatory autoimmune disease (Panitch et al. 1987 ) . Furthermore, an increase in TNF-\u03b1 expression precedes relapses and infl ammatory activity as measured by MRI, while the mRNA levels of anti-infl ammatory cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 \u03b2 decline. The overexpression of these cytokines may be involved in disease pathogenesis by causing the upregulation of MHC and adhesion molecule expression on endothelial and glial cells, activating macrophages and recruiting TH1 cells, or by damaging oligodendroglial cells and myelin sheathes directly.

Over the past two decades, two immunomodulatory therapies, namely IFN-\u03b2 and Copolymer-1 (Cop-1)/glatiramer acetate , have been used extensively in the treatment of MS with an excellent track record of efficacy and safety. IFN-\u03b2 counteracts many of the effects of IFN-\u03b3 including the recruitment of inflammatory cells and the upregulation of MHC and adhesion molecules (Paty and Li 1993 ; Stone et al. 1995 ) . Additionally, IFN-\u03b2 has been shown to lower the exacerbation rate in MS patients with a relapsing remitting course and inflammatory activity as demonstrated by MRI. COP-1 is a synthetic polypeptide consisting of a random sequence of four amino acids, blocks peptides for the MHC binding groove. COP-1 has been demonstrated to be approximately as effective as IFN-\u03b2 \u03b2 in early RRMS (Johnson et al. 1995 ) . More recently, monoclonal antibody-based therapies have been designed to act through various mechanisms, including blocking alpha-4 integrin interactions (natalizumab) or eliminating cells that express specific surface markers (e.g., CD52, alemtuzumab ; CD20 ocrelizumab and ofatumumab ; IL-2 receptor, dacluzimab ). These immunomodulatory therapies are highly effective, but have the potential for serious complications; for example, natalizumab is associated with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (caused by JC virus) and alemtuzumab is associated with the development of new autoimmune disorders. Three new oral, immunomodulatory therapies have been approved for MS; fingolimod is an antagonist of normal endogenous sphingosine-1-phosphate (S-1-P) on na\u00efve and activated T cells, teriflunomide interferes with lymphocyte proliferation by inhibiting the enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, and dimethyl fumarate counters oxidative stress (Cross and Naismith 2014 ) . Fingolimod was recently linked to a reactivation of herpes simplex 1 and severe encephali tis in patients with MS (Pfender et al. 2015 ) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 420, "end": 442, "text": "(Burnham et al. 1991 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 975, "end": 994, "text": "(Paty and Li 1993 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF236"}, {"start": 995, "end": 1014, "text": "Stone et al. 1995 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF298"}, {"start": 1398, "end": 1420, "text": "(Johnson et al. 1995 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF151"}, {"start": 2374, "end": 2400, "text": "(Cross and Naismith 2014 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}, {"start": 2517, "end": 2539, "text": "(Pfender et al. 2015 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF242"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Immune Factors"}, {"text": "Over the years, many environmental factors, including vitamin D defi ciency, diet, dog ownership, and smoking (Riccio et al. 2011 ; Suresh Kumar et al. 2013 ) , have been associated with the pathophysiology of MS.

Marie posited that several organisms were involved in the pathogenesis of MS, either alone or in combination, based on the anecdotal association of acute infectious diseases (including typhoid, malaria, pneumonia, and childhood exanthemata) with the onset of disease.

Viruses involved in demyelinating diseases of nonhuman animals and man belong to disparate families including: Coronavirus (mouse hepatitis virus (MHV); Lentivirus (Visna virus and Caprine arthritis encephalitis virus); Orthoretrovirus (HTLV-I), Polyoma (SV40); Paramyxovirus (CDV and measles virus), Picornavirus ( Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) , encephalomyocarditis virus), Rhabdovirus ( Chandipura virus , vesicular stomatitis virus ), and Togavirus (Ross River virus, Semliki Forest virus (SFV) , and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus) (Rodriguez et al. 1987 ; Appel 1969 ; Lavi et al. 1984 ; Haase 1975 ) .

Morphologically, it is similar to human poliovirus. Of interest, TMEV occasionally penetrates the CNS and causes an acute infl ammation of the anterior horn cells that pathologically resembles poliomyelitis. One to fi ve months after recovering from the acute paralytic disease, surviving mice develop a progressive infl ammatory myelopathy characterized by extensive demyelination (Lipton 1975 ) . TMEV is used as a model for MS because the pathological anomalies are limited to the CNS, infection is latent and persistent, demyelination is mediated by the immune system and occurs after a long incubation period, antibodies to myelin and proteolipid protein can be detected in diseased animals, and there are recurrences of demyelination and remyelination reminiscent of RRMS (Rodriguez et al. 1987 ) . Moreover, there is a clear genetic component in the development of TMEV-mediated disease in mice; TMEV-infected disease-susceptible SJL/J mice develop a persistent CNS infection and later develop autoimmune demyelination, while disease-resistant C57BL/6 (B6) mice rapidly clear the infection and develop no autoimmune pathology (Chastain et al. 2015 ) . The susceptibility of specifi c mouse strains to TMEV-mediated demyelinating disease is associated with MHC class I genes (Borrow et al. 1992 ; Thompkins et al. 2002 ) . Of interest, it is the persistent, avirulent strain of TMEV that causes chronic CNS disease (Pevear et al. 1988 ) . As an animal model of MS, TMEV has been particularly useful in the study of axonal damage and infl ammatory-induced demyelination (Procaccini et al. 2015 ) . The model also has relevance in investigations focused on the mechanisms of therapeutic drugs in MS. For example, dimethyl fumarate, a relatively new therapeutic option for MS, has been found to suppress TMEV-induced demyelinating disease via modulation of the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway (Kobayashi et al. 2015 ) . In vivo depletion and neutralization studies implicate both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in TMEV-induced demyelination (Tsunoda and Fujinami 2010 ; Mecha et al. 2013 ) and the deletion of virus-specifi c T cells enhances remyelination (Denic et al. 2014 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 487, "end": 501, "text": "(Lipton 1975 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF189"}, {"start": 883, "end": 907, "text": "(Rodriguez et al. 1987 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF257"}, {"start": 1238, "end": 1261, "text": "(Chastain et al. 2015 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 1386, "end": 1407, "text": "(Borrow et al. 1992 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1408, "end": 1431, "text": "Thompkins et al. 2002 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF306"}, {"start": 1526, "end": 1547, "text": "(Pevear et al. 1988 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF241"}, {"start": 1680, "end": 1705, "text": "(Procaccini et al. 2015 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF248"}, {"start": 1988, "end": 2012, "text": "(Kobayashi et al. 2015 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF164"}, {"start": 2127, "end": 2155, "text": "(Tsunoda and Fujinami 2010 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF309"}, {"start": 2156, "end": 2175, "text": "Mecha et al. 2013 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF208"}, {"start": 2243, "end": 2261, "text": "(Denic et al. 2014", "ref_id": "BIBREF84"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Models of Virus-Induced Demyelination"}, {"text": "In addition, defi cient NK Dendritic responses and the innate immune system have been demonstrated to play a role in disease progression in persistently infected mice (Chastain et al. 2015 ; Gilli et al. 2016 ) . Importantly, epitope spreading, in which the initial response is directed against Theiler's virus and then broadens to myelin proteins, occurs in this model, providing a unique opportunity to investigate epitope spreading in the pathophysiology of a demyelinating disease. Murine hepatitis virus ( MHV ) is a coronavirus that, as the name suggests, primarily infects the liver. However, several strains, including the JHM strain, are neurotropic and cause encephalitis with subsequent CNS demyelination (Mecha et al. 2013 ) . The virus readily infects oligodendrocytes and neurons and kills most animals. However, MHV can establish a persistent infection of astrocytes and those animals that survive acute infection develop a chronic progressive neurologic disease characterized by scattered demyelinating lesions and CNS infi ltration of macrophages and lymphocytes (Kyuwa and Stohlman 1990 ) . As the disease progresses, lymphocytic infi ltration diminishes while demyelination and astrogliosis increase. These lesions resemble the chronic plaques of MS. The role of the immune system in the pathology of MHV-induced demyelination is complex; CNS disease can occur in the absence of B-and T cells, but does occur with the transfer of virus-specifi c antibodies or T cells (Matthews et al. 2002 ; Kim and Perlman 2005 ; Stohlman and Hinton 2001 ) . B cells are necessary to prevent reactivation of virus in the CNS following clearance of acute infection (Bender and Weiss 2010 ) . In addition, monocyte-derived macrophages and microglia are present in regions of demyelination (Bender and Weiss 2010 ) .

Recently, a decrease in regulatory T cells, and CD8(+) T cells expressing the inhibitory NKG2A(+) receptor accompanied by elevated activating NK receptors on NK cells has been described in patients with SSPE, supporting a role for chronic stimulation by viral antigens and an over-activated immune response in SSPE pathogenesis {Yentur, 2014 #41}.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 256, "end": 279, "text": "(Filipowicz et al. 1983", "ref_id": "BIBREF95"}, {"start": 877, "end": 897, "text": "(Souraud et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF294"}, {"start": 1339, "end": 1360, "text": "(Moulin et al. 2011 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF216"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Models of Virus-Induced Demyelination"}, {"text": "The human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I ) is associated with a chronic, progressive neurologic disease known as HAM/TSP.

The immunologic hallmarks of HAM/TSP include an increase in ex vivo spontaneous lymphoproliferation in the absence of antigenic stimulation or IL-2 (Kramer et al. 1989 ) , the presence of HTLV-I specifi c, CD8+ CTL in the PBL, and an increase in antibodies to HTLV-I in sera and CSF. In HAM/TSP, natural killer cells tend to be diminished in both number and activity. HTLV-1 is primarily found in the CD4(+) CD25(+) T cell subset (Regulatory T cells: Tregs ); these cells are critical for establishing peripheral immune tolerance and known to be dysfunctional in HAM/TSP. Recent work by our group suggests that epigenetic modifi cation of the FOXP3 Treg-specifi c demethylated region decreases the functional suppression of Tregs and may play an important role in the neuropathogenesis of HAM/TSP (Anderson et al. 2014 ) . Although the suggestion of disease-specifi c HTLV-I strains has been dismissed as a factor in the determination of disease susceptibility, increased viral load has been implicated in the pathogenesis of HAM/TSP . It has been suggested that increased proviral loads may be a predictor for the progression from the asymptomatic carrier state to HAM/TSP. It has also been suggested that the HLA class I allele A2*01 may confer a protective effect on the development of HAM/TSP by infl uencing the proviral load in infected individuals.

The molecular mimicry model suggests that an immune response against viral antigens that cross-reacts with normal host cell components may contribute to the pathogenesis of MS. Several viral sequences contain part of the human MBP sequence (Jahnke et al. 1985 ) . Moreover, a number of viruses have been shown to share peptide motifs or other antigenic similarities with the components of myelin (Hogeboom 2015 ; Mameli et al. 2014 ; Zheng and Zhang 2014 ) . Other relevant examples of molecular mimicry include the cross-reactivity of antibodies against proteins of herpes simplex and measles virus with human intermediate fi laments (Fujinami et al. 1983 ; McCoy et al. 2006 ; Gabibov et al. 2011 ; Boucher et al. 2007 ). In vivo models have supported a role for molecular mimicry in infl ammatory neurologic disease. For example, rabbits immunized with a synthetic peptide containing sequences of the hepatitis B virus polymerase develop experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) lesions . Rabbits that develop EAE as a consequence of immunizations with synthetic peptide generated a humoral and cell-mediated immune response to both myelin and hepatitis B polymerase (Fujinami and Oldstone 1985 ) . Additionally, cross-reactivity between a monoclonal antibody to the VP1 protein of TMEV and oligodendrocytes has been demonstrated. Demyelinating disease was observed in mice who were administered the VPI monoclonal antibody. Subsequently, amino acid homologies between immunogenic epitopes of SFV and myelin autoantigens, MBP, myelin proteolipid protein (PLP) and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) were identifi ed (Mokhtarian et al. 1999 ) . Immunization of B6 mice with SFV proteins induced signifi cant lymphocyte proliferation to the SFV E2 peptide as well as MOG peptide, 18-32, but not to MBP or PLP peptides. Immunization with both MOG 18-32 and E2 115-129 induced a later-onset chronic EAE-like disease (Mokhtarian et al. 1999 ) . These examples of molecular mimicry support the possibility that immunological recognition of viral peptides of suffi cient structural similarity to the immunodominant MBP peptide may lead to clonal expansion of MBP-reactive T cells in MS. Therefore, viruses which are known to cause latent or persistent infections such as herpes viruses may lead to a chronic antigenic stimulation of autoreactive T-cell clones (Allegretta et al. 1990 ) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 397, "end": 418, "text": "(Jahnke et al. 1985 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF144"}, {"start": 553, "end": 569, "text": "(Hogeboom 2015 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF132"}, {"start": 570, "end": 590, "text": "Mameli et al. 2014 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF200"}, {"start": 591, "end": 613, "text": "Zheng and Zhang 2014 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF327"}, {"start": 792, "end": 815, "text": "(Fujinami et al. 1983 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF104"}, {"start": 816, "end": 835, "text": "McCoy et al. 2006 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF206"}, {"start": 836, "end": 857, "text": "Gabibov et al. 2011 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF105"}, {"start": 858, "end": 877, "text": "Boucher et al. 2007", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 1334, "end": 1363, "text": "(Fujinami and Oldstone 1985 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF103"}, {"start": 1790, "end": 1815, "text": "(Mokhtarian et al. 1999 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF213"}, {"start": 2086, "end": 2111, "text": "(Mokhtarian et al. 1999 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF213"}, {"start": 2527, "end": 2552, "text": "(Allegretta et al. 1990 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Potential Mechanisms of Virus-Induced Demyelination in MS"}, {"text": "A second possible mechanism of virus-induced demyelination is that of a \"nonspecifi c bystander\" effect resulting from the reaction of lymphocytes or macrophages to diverse antigens.

The induction of infl ammatory cytokines alone, such as TNF-\u03b1, has been shown to induce demyelination. This mechanism of viral stimulation of immunocompetent cells that nonspecifi cally attack the myelin sheath could explain demyelination in the number of infections with diverse viruses. The mechanism for virus-induced demyelination is also proposed in the pathogenesis of HAM/TSP .

HLA class I and II are not normally expressed in the CNS which would prevent antigen presentation necessary for CTL activity. However, HLA class I and class II expression are upregulated by several cytokines including IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 which can be induced by HTLV-I and are known to be upregulated in HAM/TSP patients. The release of cytokine and chemokine production by HTLV-I is potentially destructive to cells of the CNS. A similar mechanism could explain the virus induction of demyelinating disease in MS. Alternatively, it has been proposed that a combination of two mechanisms, molecular mimicry and bystander activation, induced by virus infection, can lead to CNS demyelinating diseases in MS. In this scenario, viral proteins having molecular mimicry with self-proteins in the CNS can prime genetically susceptible individuals.

Indirect evidence in support of this theory comes from EAE in animals and parainfectious encephalomyelitis in humans where virusspecifi c CD4+ lymphocytes proliferate in response to MBP (Liebert et al. 1988 ) . It is unknown how viruses break immune tolerance and force the host to mount a strong cell-mediated immune response to brain antigens. As the virus replicates, it may incorporate host antigens into its envelope and inserts, modifi es, or coats itself with cellular antigens on the cell surface. It is biologically possible that these newly exposed antigens may be recognized and treated by the host as foreign (Hirsch et al. 1975 ) . For example, the presence of CD13 has been demonstrated in the envelope of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) . CD13 becomes associated with HCMV upon budding in the Golgi-derived vacuoles during early egress (Soderberg et al. 1996 ) . CD13-specifi c antibodies were detected in the majority of patients with HCMV viremia or disease after bone marrow transplantation (Soderberg et al. 1996 ; Naucler et al. 1996 ) . These antibodies were found to cross-react with structures in normal skin biopsies (Soderberg et al. 1996 ; Naucler et al. 1996 ) . Alternatively, lymphotropic viruses might interact with the immune regulatory system by destroying some populations of lymphocytes or stimulating the generation of autoreactive lymphocyte clones. Many lymphotropic viruses are capable of transforming infected cells and rendering them immortal. It has been demonstrated in vitro that cells immortalized by viruses, such as EBV, are capable of secreting autoantibodies (Rosen 1977 ) . Further, it has been demonstrated that EBV infection transforms CD25+ B cells into antibody-secreting cells in rheumatoid arthritis.

In the absence of evidence for an exogenous retrovirus clearly associated with MS, it has been suggested that human endogenous retroviruses (HERV) could be involved (Rasmussen et al. 2000 ; Rudge 1991 ) . HERV comprise up to 1 % of human DNA and have been implicated as \"triggers\" in a variety of autoimmune disorders (Krieg et al. 1992 ; Nakagawa et al. 1997 ) . The proposed pathogenic role for HERV is based on the correlation of superantigen expression from the endogenous retrovirus termed IDDMK 1,2, 22 and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and the presence of autoantibodies that crossreact with HERV proteins in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome (Benoist and Mathis 1997 ; Conrad et al. 1997 ; Garry 1994 ) . Endogenous retroviruses may infl uence immune regulation through direct effects on gene products due to integration sites, interactions with exogenous viruses, or as autoantigens (Rasmussen et al. 2000 ). An endogenous retrovirus, known as the multiple sclerosis retrovirus (MSRV), has been associated with MS (Perron et al. 1997 ). An extensive characterization of this family of HERV, which has been designated as human endogenous retrovirus-W (HERV-W) , classifi es MSRV as a member of the HERV-W family (Blond et al. 1999 ; Fujinami and Libbey 1999 ) . MSRV pol (polymerase gene encoding retroviral reverse transcriptase) sequences were isolated from retroviral particles released by leptomeningeal cells (LM7) cultured from the CSF of an MS patient (Perron et al. 1997 ) . Additionally, pol sequences were isolated from the serum of a signifi cantly higher percentage of MS patients than controls (Garson et al. 1998 ) . Of interest, proteins from HSV-I have been demonstrated to transactivate MSRV in vitro (Perron et al. 1997 ) . This observation may be consistent with the correlation between MS exacerbations and viral infections (Sibley et al. 1985 ) . Sequence analysis of the MSRV pol gene indicates that it is virtually identical to the pol gene of the endogenous retrovirus-9 family, which is expressed in MS and control human tissues (Brahic and Bureau 1997 ) . Interestingly, it has been suggested that MSRV pol sequences are transcriptionally active and expressed in lymphocytes from both MS patients and controls (Nowak et al. 2003 ) . Notably, in this initial study, MSRV Pol was expressed more frequently in lymphocytes and serum from MS patients compared with controls (Nowak et al. 2003 ) .

The virion architecture of HHV-6 is similar to that of other herpesviruses and consists of a core containing a linear double-stranded DNA, an icosadeltahedral capsid, a tegument surrounding the capsid, and an envelope spiked with viral glycoproteins on its surface.

HHV-6 is an attractive candidate as a possible etiologic agent in MS for several reasons. (1) Primary infection with HHV-6 usually occurs during the fi rst few years of life and the involvement of HHV-6 with MS is consistent with epidemiological evidence in MS suggesting that exposure to an etiologic agent before puberty (Kurtzke 1995 ) . (2) HHV-6, particularly the HHV-6A variant, is highly neurotropic (Hall et al. 1998 ). (3) Primary infection with HHV-6 occasionally results in neurologic complications including meningitis and meningo-encephalitis and febrile seizures (Asano et al. 1992 ). HHV-6 has been demonstrated to cause fatal encephalitis in AIDS patients and in individuals immunosuppressed as a consequence of bone marrow transplantation (Knox and Carrigan 1995 ) . Furthermore, a neuropathogenic role for HHV-6 has been suggested based on the development of a variety of disorders associated with active HHV-6 infection including fulminant demyelinating encephalomyelitis, subacute leukoencephalitis, necrotizing encephalitis, PML, and chronic myelopathy (Carrigan et al. 1996 ; Novoa et al. 1997 ; Mackenzie et al. 1995 ) . One of the fundamental properties of herpesviruses is their tendency to reactivate. The same factors that often lead to herpesvirus reactivation, such as stress and infection with another agent, have also been associated with MS exacerbations. Unfortunately, the mechanisms by which HHV-6 achieves latency and reactivation are poorly understood. It believed that the virus reactivates frequently as it is readily found in the saliva and peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy adults and reactivation in transplant recipients is not uncommon and can cause severe clinical manifestations such as encephalitis, and bone marrow suppression (Yoshikawa 2004 ) . (4) Herpesviruses are typically latent in nervous tissue and cannot be structurally identifi ed in a latent state. Therefore, herpesviruses are not likely to be found by electron microscopy. (5) HHV-6 is pleiotrophic and infects cells of both lymphoid and nonlymphoid origin.

Additionally, this report further supports a role for HHV-6 in the pathogenesis of MS by suggesting that the presence of serum HHV-6 DNA, similar to the presence of gadolinium enhancing lesions, coincides with clinical worsening in a subset of patients (Berti et al. 2002 ) . Later studies measuring the presence of active HHV-6 in PBMC and CSF found that high levels of HHV-6A were frequently present in the early stages of MS and suggested that viral replication takes place within the CNS (Rotola et al. 2004 ) . It was further confi rmed that HHV-6 viral loads are also elevated during relapses/exacerbations of MS (Alvarez-Lafuente et al. 2006a , b ) . Moreover, using a novel digital droplet PCR assay, Leibovitch et al. have demonstrated that both the presence of DNA from the more neurotropic HHV-6A and the simultaneous detection of HHV-6A and HHV-6B (representative of co-infection) occur more frequently in saliva from MS patients than controls (Leibovitch et al. 2014 ) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 213, "end": 233, "text": "(Berti et al. 2002 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 971, "end": 991, "text": "(Berti et al. 2002 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1210, "end": 1231, "text": "(Rotola et al. 2004 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF263"}, {"start": 1337, "end": 1373, "text": "(Alvarez-Lafuente et al. 2006a , b )", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1427, "end": 1444, "text": "Leibovitch et al.", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1674, "end": 1699, "text": "(Leibovitch et al. 2014 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF183"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "HHV-6"}, {"text": "Cellular immune responses to HHV-6 have been compared in MS patients and controls Tejada-Simon et al. 2002 .

However, a signifi cantly higher percentage of patients with MS had proliferative responses to HHV-6A (66 %) compared to healthy controls (33 %). At present it is unknown whether the increased frequency of lymphoproliferative responses to the HHV-6A lysate in patients with MS is the result of a higher seroprevalence of the HHV-6A in MS patients or in an altered host immune response .

As discussed above, OCBs are common among CNS disorders with an infectious component. Moreover, when the causative agent is known, OCBs are typically specifi c to the agent of interest; in SSPE, for example, OCBs primarily target measles virus; in HAM/TSP, the OCBs are specifi c for HTLV-I, etc. Therefore, the identifi cation of HHV-6-specifi c bands in a subset of MS patients has strengthened the association of HHV-6 and MS and indicates that HHV-6 infection of the CNS is involved in the pathophysiology of the disorder. In 2014, Pietl\u00e4inen-Nickl\u00e9n and colleagues analyzed patients with demyelinating diseases, including MS, and HHV-6-reactive CSF OCB, and found that patients with HHV-6 OCB appear to form a separate group that skews younger than patients without HHV-6 OCB, suggesting that antibody reactivity to HHV-6 may be a key, early event in the neuropathogenesis of MS (Pietilainen-Nicklen et al. 2014 ).

Accordingly, rather than a single, unique causative agent, we suggest that multiple viruses, including ubiquitous and often commensal pathogens like HHV-6 and EBV, may be involved in the etiology of MS that trigger disease in different subsets of individuals through common mechanisms via a virus-specifi c and/or a cross-reactive autoimmune process, resulting in clinical diseases in a subset of genetically susceptible individuals.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 234, "end": 247, "text": "(Marie 1895 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF201"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Concluding Thoughts"}, {"text": "As we posit that that several viruses may be involved in the etiology of MS and that particular viruses trigger disease in different subsets of individuals, we therefore suggest that there may be common mechanism(s) or, perhaps, interactions with a common receptor(s). An insight into how this may be possible may come from further interrogation of the interactions between HHV-6 and its receptor. Santoro and colleagues demonstrated that CD46, also known as the membrane cofactor protein (MCP) , is the cellular receptor for HHV-6 (Santoro et al. 1999 ) . CD46 is a member of family of glycoprotein that function as regulators of complement activation (RCA) and prevent spontaneous activation of complement on autologous cells. CD46 is expressed on all human nucleated cells and soluble forms can be found in plasma tears and seminal fl uid of normal individuals (Hara et al. 1992 ) . The use of a virtually ubiquitous human molecule as a surface receptor helps to explain the pleiotropism of HHV-6. Notably, HHV-6 (a large, double stranded DNA virus) and measles virus (a negative-sense, single stranded RNA virus) both use CD46 as a receptor and both viruses have been strongly associated with MS (Dorig et al. 1993 ; Oldstone et al. 1999 ) . Additionally, other viruses use various members of the RCA family as cellular receptors; EBV uses CD21 while CD55 is used by several echoviruses and coxsakieviruses (Bergelson et al. 1994 (Bergelson et al. , 1995 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 532, "end": 554, "text": "(Santoro et al. 1999 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF274"}, {"start": 864, "end": 883, "text": "(Hara et al. 1992 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF124"}, {"start": 1200, "end": 1220, "text": "(Dorig et al. 1993 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF90"}, {"start": 1221, "end": 1243, "text": "Oldstone et al. 1999 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF229"}, {"start": 1411, "end": 1433, "text": "(Bergelson et al. 1994", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1434, "end": 1458, "text": "(Bergelson et al. , 1995", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Concluding Thoughts"}, {"text": "Could viruses that share a family of receptors in common, such as HHV-6, EBV, and measles virus cause MS by a similar mechanism? It is theoretically possible that the engagement of an RCA receptor by one or many of these viruses may result in increased activation of the complement cascade on autologous cells through downregulation of the receptor. This abnormal increase in complement could lead to widespread tissue damage through cytokine dysregulation, cytolysis, and nitric oxide production (Ghali and Schneider-Schaulies 1998 ; Karp et al. 1996 ) . Increased levels of the complement regulatory protein CD46 have been demonstrated in both the serum and CSF of MS patients compared with healthy controls and other neurologic disease patients (Soldan et al. 2001 ) . Elevated levels of soluble serum CD46 were also found in other infl ammatory disease cohort, indicating that an increase in soluble serum CD46 may be a common phenomenon in autoimmune disorders (Soldan et al. 2001 ; Cuida et al. 1997 ; Kawano et al. 1999 ) . Therefore, the increased levels of CD46 demonstrated in the serum and CSF of MS patients may be indicative of an increased activation of the complement system in MS, both peripherally and intrathecally. However, a signifi cant correlation was observed between elevated levels of serum soluble CD46 and the detection of serum HHV-6 DNA in serum from MS patients, while no serum HHV-6 DNA was detected in other infl ammatory disease controls (Soldan et al. 2001 ) . Therefore, while an increase in serum soluble CD46 is common in infl ammatory diseases in general, immune-pathogenic mechanisms involving both HHV-6 and its receptor are likely to be unique to MS.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 497, "end": 534, "text": "(Ghali and Schneider-Schaulies 1998 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF108"}, {"start": 535, "end": 553, "text": "Karp et al. 1996 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF155"}, {"start": 748, "end": 769, "text": "(Soldan et al. 2001 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF291"}, {"start": 966, "end": 987, "text": "(Soldan et al. 2001 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF291"}, {"start": 988, "end": 1007, "text": "Cuida et al. 1997 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}, {"start": 1008, "end": 1028, "text": "Kawano et al. 1999 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF157"}, {"start": 1471, "end": 1492, "text": "(Soldan et al. 2001 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF291"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Concluding Thoughts"}, {"text": "Alternatively, these viruses and their common receptor could play a role as an MS \"trigger'\" either directly or indirectly through an autoimmune mechanism. As viruses replicate, they frequently incorporate host antigens, including their own receptors, into their envelopes as has been demonstrated for CMV, HIV-1, SIV, and HTLV-I. Incorporation of the receptor into the virus envelope could cause the antigen to be recognized and treated by the host as foreign (Soderberg et al. 1996 ; Marschang et al. 1995 ; Montefi ori et al. 1994 ) . This phenomenon could account for the increase in CD46-specifi c autoantibodies observed in MS (Pinter et al. 2000 ) . Moreover, complement components, including CD46, play an important role in regulating activation of both B cells and T cells, presenting another possible mechanism for these viruses to infl uence the immune response and, potentially, the expression and activation of other viruses (Jabara et al. 2011 ; Fuchs et al. 2009 ; Ni Choileain and Astier 2011 ; Astier et al. 2003 ; Le Friec et al. 2012 ) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 461, "end": 485, "text": "(Soderberg et al. 1996 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF287"}, {"start": 486, "end": 509, "text": "Marschang et al. 1995 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF203"}, {"start": 510, "end": 535, "text": "Montefi ori et al. 1994 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF214"}, {"start": 633, "end": 654, "text": "(Pinter et al. 2000 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF245"}, {"start": 938, "end": 959, "text": "(Jabara et al. 2011 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF139"}, {"start": 960, "end": 979, "text": "Fuchs et al. 2009 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF101"}, {"start": 980, "end": 1010, "text": "Ni Choileain and Astier 2011 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF222"}, {"start": 1011, "end": 1031, "text": "Astier et al. 2003 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1032, "end": 1054, "text": "Le Friec et al. 2012 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF182"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Concluding Thoughts"}, {"text": "Currently, HHV-6 and EBV are receiving considerable attention as potential MS \"triggers.\" Although there is a preponderance of evidence supporting relationships between EBV and HHV-6 and MS, it can not be defi nitively asserted that either EBV or HHV-6 causes or drives the pathogenesis of MS.
