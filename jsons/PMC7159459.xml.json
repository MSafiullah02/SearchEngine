Wang & Hu, 2013). Although there is twice the number of rodent species as there are bat species, bats are reported to be natural hosts to greater varieties of zoonotic viruses per species than rodents (Luis et al., 2013). As many as 4,167 viruses belonging to 23 virus families have been isolated from 196 bat species in 69 countries worldwide (Chen, Liu, Yang, & Jin, 2014). Bats can be persistently and latently infected with the virus without showing any clinical symptoms (Field et al., 2011; Peel et al., 2018).",

            "text": "Bats belong to the order Chiroptera, the second largest order of mammals after rodents. Studies have thus far reported 1,240 species of bats in the world, which represent more than 20% of mammalian species (Calisher et al., 2006; Wang, Walker, & Poon, 2011). The order Chiroptera is divided into two suborders: Yinpterochiroptera and Yangochiroptera (Lei & Dong, 2016; Teeling et al., 2005). Fruit bats, included in the suborder Yinpterochiroptera, are often found near residential areas (Basri et al., 2017). The decline of tree and fruit populations in forests, forest fires and extreme climate change often lead to the foray of fruit bats into human farming areas, especially during the fruiting season (Basri et al., 2017; P\u00e1ez, Restif, Eby, & Plowright, 2018). Large\u2010sized fruit bats, such as flying foxes, are nomadic foragers capable of flying up to 100 km from the roosting site in one night (Hengjan et al., 2018). Fruit bats, being social beings, are reported to engage in conflicts over food with other species such as monkeys (Hengjan et al., 2017). Fruit\u2010eating behaviour is also an important factor aiding in spreading of viruses between species. Because bats cannot swallow large amounts of food, they chew the fruit and spit out the fibre (Dobson, 2005). The ability of fruit bats to fly and interact with other species, including domesticated animals and humans, increases the potential for zoonotic outbreaks (Basri et al., 2017). Some zoonotic virus that have been serologically detected in fruit bats include paramyxovirus, herpesvirus, parvovirus, polyomavirus, coronavirus and filovirus (Anindita et al., 2015; Calisher et al., 2006; Hayman et al., 2012; Kobayashi et al., 2015; Sasaki et al., 2016,2014,2012; Sendow et al., 2010,2013).",

            "text": "Bats are known to have a stronger immune component than other mammals (Pavlovich et al., 2018; Schountz, Baker, Butler, & Munster, 2017). Various components of their immunity have adapted to the existence of the virus, resulting in a symbiotic relationship between them. This suggests that bats have a strong immune organ structure to prepare for viral infection that might damage their system. However, details of the bat immune system remain to be elucidated completely. One important immune organ that performs several functions related to differences in structure between species is the spleen (Brendolan, Rosado, Carsetti, Selleri, & Dear, 2007; Cesta, 2006; Haley, 2003). This secondary lymphoid organ plays a major role in innate and adaptive immunity to bloodborne pathogens, including viruses (Den Haan & Kraal, 2012; Mebius & Kraal, 2005; Zhao, Liu, Guo, & Zhu, 2015). The organ also plays a role in extramedullary haematopoiesis, haemostasis, metabolism of red blood cells and blood storing. Role dominance of the spleen varies between species and is dependent on the organ structure and its constituent cell components (Bowdler, 2002; Brendolan et al., 2007; Udroiu, 2006). The spleen parenchyma is wrapped and infiltrated by capsules and trabeculae composed of collagen fibres and smooth muscles. The thickness of the capsule and the spread of smooth muscles affect contractility, which determines the speed of blood ejection from the spleen. The characteristics of the spleen sinuses also vary between species: some species have sinuses (sinusal type) and some do not have sinuses (non\u2010sinusal type; Bowdler, 2002; Press & Landsverk, 2006; Udroiu, 2006).",

            "text": "It is interesting to explore the morphology of bat spleen because of the high structural variations of the organ between species affect its physiological function. The flying ability of bats makes them have a daily high metabolic rate; therefore, they require rapid oxygen supply (O'Shea et al., 2014; Thomas, 1975). The fulfilment of oxygen requirements in aerobic mammals activities can be done by increasing the circulating blood volume, which is in resting state, the blood stored in the spleen as reported in racehorses, hunter dogs and diving seals (Dane et al., 2006; Poole & Erickson, 2015; Thornton et al., 2001). Blood ejection from the spleen requires strong splenic contraction which is must be supported by the numerous smooth muscle among collagen that builds capsule and trabeculae structure. Chiropteran order is also known to have hibernation and torpor abilities. Hibernating mammals store blood and platelets in the spleen to prevent blood thickening and clotting (Cooper et al., 2012; Lidicker & Davis, 1955; Mann & Drips, 1916). Therefore, the spleen structure of the bats may support blood storing, blood generation and blood ejection capability. Bats as the reservoir of various viruses also demand strong defense structure of immune organ to prepare for viral infections. The morphophysiological aspect of bat spleen has not been widely described previously; therefore, the aim of this study was to examine different compartment of morphological structure of fruit bats spleen and to describe it physiological function based from the morphology findings.",

The capture process of fruit bats has been approved by the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, Department of Natural Resource and Ecosystem Conservation, Indonesia, with license numbers SK.197/KSDAE/SET/KSA.2/5/2017. Fruit bats were captured at night using mist nets and were transported in cloth bags to the laboratory for further studies. Captured bats had been confirmed to be sexually mature and not pregnant or breastfeeding. In the laboratory, bats were acclimatized for 24 hr and provided with fruit juice and drinking water ad libitum. Bats were identified by their morphological characteristics according to the field key described by Suyanto (2001) for these species in Indonesia.",

Animals were anesthetized using a combination of ketamine (10 mg/kg) and xylazine (2 mg/kg) (Sohayati et al., 2008). After losing consciousness, animals were killed with ketamine overdose. The spleen sample collection comprised two methods of fixation: perfusion and non\u2010perfusion fixation. Perfusion procedure was performed by puncturing the left heart ventricle with a needle and flowing a saline solution into the bloodstream. The right atria were then cut to allow for blood to flow out and replaced by saline solution. The saline solution was then replaced by a 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) until the entire bat organs, including the spleens, were perfectly fixed. The spleens were then collected and post\u2010fixed using 4% PFA. Non\u2010perfused spleens were collected after opening the abdominal cavity followed by fixing them immediately in 4% PFA or Bouin solution.",

Primary trabeculae branched out collagen fibres that continued to become secondary trabeculae or splenic cord. Red pulp generally consisted of cord, capillaries and a wide vascular space contains blood (Figure 3). Splenic cords divided red pulp into small compartments that contained red blood cells and macrophages (Figure 3). A few myeloid and erythroid cells were found in cords, whereas megakaryocytes were not observed. Haemosiderin, a brown pigment produced by macrophage phagocytes against erythrocytes, was only found slightly. However, in P. vampyrus, several melanin pigments were observed (Figure 3c).",

High extramedullary haematopoiesis is also normally found in Eulipotyphla and Rodentia spleen throughout their life which is characterized by the high number of erythroid and myeloid in the red pulp (Barthold, Griffey, & Percy, 2016; Cesta, 2006; Udroiu, 2017; Ward et al., 2018). This study found no megakaryocyte in the red pulp of the three bat species. This indicates that the bat's spleen has little or no role in thrombopoiesis.

Melanin pigment in P. vampyrus spleen (Figure 3) was commonly found in species with black hair like in several rat species (Ward et al., 2018).",

Tanaka (1990) described Vespertilio's red pulp as having a wide splenic cord and less differentiated vein belonging to a non\u2010sinusal type. This study found that fruit bats have a wider vascular space than splenic cords that resemble sinusal type character. However, further observations using electron microscopes need to be done to confirm this finding. The sinusal type of spleens was reported in rats, humans and dogs (Press & Landsverk, 2006; Udroiu, 2006; Ward et al., 2018). Mice along with various mammals such as horses, cows, cats, pigs and armadillos were classified to have the non\u2010sinusal type of spleen (Bacha & Bacha, 2000; Gal\u00edndez, Cod\u00f3n, & Casanave, 2000; Press & Landsverk, 2006; Snook, 1950; Ward et al., 2018).",

            "text": "Evolutionary, sinusal spleens have a dominance of defensive function, whereas non\u2010sinusal spleens have a dominant role as a blood reservoir (Udroiu, 2006). The sinuses of the spleen have a special function in the filtration of damaged erythrocytes and blood pathogens (Buffet et al., 2011). Although this study has not been able to confirm the type of spleen vascular space, numerous and wide vascular space in the three fruit bats species were filled with blood indicating there is a space to reserve blood (Figures 3 and 4). The ability of the spleen of fruit bats to store blood is also supported by spleen size, which has a mid\u2010value between rats and mice that have a wide area of splenic cord to reserve blood. C. brachyotis and R. aegyptiacus were reported to have a spleen weight ratio compared to body weight of 0.4% (Attia, El\u2010Desouki, Madkour, Sayed, & El\u2010Refaiy, 2007; Hanadhita, Rahma, Prawira, Sismin Satyaningtijas, & Agungpriyono, 2018), while rats were 0.2%\u22120.3% (Cesta, 2006) and mice 0.7% (Webster & Liljegren, 1977). Sinusal spleens with blood\u2010storing ability are present in camels (Zidan, Kassem, Dougbag, et al., 2000), hunter dogs (Dane et al., 2006) and humans from bajau tribe (Ilardo et al., 2018). Chiropteran order had been reported to store blood in the spleen during torpor and hibernation (Nuweller, 2000; Lidicker & Davis, 1955). Myotis sodalis is reported to have a six times larger spleen and less circulating erythrocyte counts in the inactive phase than when active (Lidicker & Davis, 1955). Bats are endotherms as the other mammals. Bats with small body mass need to consume a lot of food relative to their body mass to maintain their energy requirements. However, during extreme climate and lack of food supply, bats were able to regulate their temperature to conserve energy by undergoing torpor and hibernation (Altringham, 2011). Small pteropodids (body weight 16\u201318 g) in tropical and subtropical climate with warm ambient temperatures can also undergo daily torpor especially when the food source is scarce (Coburn & Geiser, 1998; Geiser & Stawski, 2011; Kelm & Von Helversen, 2007; McNab & Bonaccorso, 2001; Stawski, Willis, & Geiser, 2014). C. titthaecheilus and R. leschenaultii were medium size pteropodids and the observations done of this two genus showed that they did not undergo daily torpor (Barclay et al., 2017; McNab & Bonaccorso, 2001). Meanwhile, P. vampyrus is a large size pteropodid which is always at positive energy state; therefore, it does not require torpor (McNab & Bonaccorso, 2001); and instead, they fulfil their energy by foraging food all the time (Hengjan et al., 2018). However, with the capacity of the red pulp vascular space to store blood, all three species of bats might undergo torpor during extreme conditions or in condition when the food is lacking.",

            "text": "The white pulp of the three species of bats spleen consists of PALS, lymphoid follicles and MZ (Figure 5). Among PALS and marginal zone, there is marginal sinus as the entrance gate of blood into the marginal zone (Figure 5g\u2013i). PALS is the area of lymphocyte aggregation that surrounds the central artery. PALS is mostly dominated by T\u2010cell lymphocytes but dendritic cells can also be found (Steiniger & Barth, 2000). The group of lymphocyte cells adjacent to PALS which has a dark zone (corona) with a bright zone in the middle (germinal centre) is a lymphoid follicle. Corona is a zone of B cells that have not been activated by antigens. It has dense nuclei and smaller cytoplasm that form a dark zone. The germinal centre consists of B cells that have been activated by antigens (Steiniger & Barth, 2000). Follicle lymphoid in all three bat species appeared to show active immune activity because it has a germinal centre (Figure 5) which is commonly found in wild animals exposed to antigens from the outer environment. Germinal centre cells in bats that are kept in the laboratory under conventional condition are positive for anti\u2010bat IgG antibody which indicates activated immunity (Omatsu, Watanabe, Akashi, & Yoshikawa, 2007). B cells that fail to produce immunoglobulins, experience apoptosis and engulfed by macrophages or called tingible body macrophages (Steiniger & Barth, 2000) can also be found in the centre of the germinal centre of the three bat species (Figure 5d\u2013f).",

Rats are also reported to have wide and prominent marginal zones whereas mice have a thin marginal zone (Ward et al., 2018). Marginal zones are an important zone for recognition and phagocytes of bloodborne antigens which may induce innate immunity and also the production of antibodies in the marginal zone (Gatto, Ruedl, Odermatt, & Bachmann, 2004; Lee, Chen, Lin, & Wang, 2011; Mebius & Kraal, 2005; Oehen et al., 2002). Marginal zones have special resident immune cells consist of marginal zone B cells, marginal metallophilic macrophages and marginal zone macrophages (Bronte & Pittet, 2013; Kraal, 1992). Marginal zone B cells play a role in the first recognition of viral infection and then produce local antibodies to opsonize pathogens that enter the spleen (Gatto et al., 2004). Marginal zone macrophages especially have surface receptors that can recognize major components of various enveloped bacteria and several types of viruses (Mebius & Kraal, 2005; Oehen et al., 2002).",

Ellipsoids of the three bat species were found numerous and spread in splenic cord with the largest population near the marginal zone (Figures 3 and 7).

Some ellipsoids gathered and closed together forming an aggregation of macrophages which form white pulp\u2010like structure (Figure 3). Ellipsoids can be found in almost all vertebrates except rodents (Steiniger, 2015). Moles, pigs, cats and dogs have numerous and wide ellipsoids, while horses, cows and sheep have medium ellipsoids sizes (Bacha & Bacha, 2000; Blue & Weiss, 1981; Press & Landsverk, 2006; Snook, 1950). Ellipsoids have a strategic function as filtration of bloodborne pathogen as well as marginal zones (Blue & Weiss, 1981; Boes & Durham, 2017; Steiniger, 2015) and take a role as a major site of blood pathogen filtration in soft\u2010shelled turtles and chickens that do not possess a marginal zones (Bao, Li, Wang, Qin, & Xu, 2009; Zhang et al., 2015). A large number of ellipsoids in the fruit bats indicate that the central arteries branch out many capillaries. A large number of capillaries with narrow lumen make a more thorough screening of the bloodborne pathogen by macrophages of ellipsoids.",
