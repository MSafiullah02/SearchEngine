Classification of severity has statistically significant differences between the three groups, compared with middle-aged patients and aged 65-79 years group, older than 80 years group had significant statistical differences in contacted to symptomatic case in 14 days. As of Feb 29, 38.3 % patients had discharged and 53.3 % patients remained in hospital in our study, the fatality of COVID-19 infection in elderly was 8.3 %. Conclusions: The COVID-19 infection is generally susceptible with a relatively high fatality rate in older patients, we should pay more attention to the elderly patients with COVID-19 infection.",

            "text": "Along with the outbreak of the epidemic of 2019 novel coronavirus , the number of older patients infected with COVID-19 was increasing in the world and it brought a serious threat to life and health. A study in the New English Journal of Medicine (NEJM) by Guan reported the clinical characteristics of coronavirus diseases 2019 in China that the rate of older patients older than 65 years with COVID-19 infection was 15.1 % (Guan et al., 2020) , while the proportion of older than 80 years was 3 % reported in the JAMA by Wu and McGoogan (Wu & McGoogan, 2020) . It was proved that population including old people was generally susceptible, and the older patients with high infection rate and fatality (Yang, Yu et al., 2020) . Unfortunately, the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 infection in older patients is unknown. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) report, as of March 3, 2020, a total of 90,870 cases with laboratory-confirmed with COVID-19 infection have been detected in the world (WHO, 2020). As a new disease and a new global health issue, COVID-19 infection is understandable that its emergence and spread cause anxiety and fear among the older population. In addition, aging population has been one of the largest problems in many countries, and there were a higher prevalence of multimorbidity and lower resistance in older patients (Feng, Liu, Guan, & Mor, 2012; Low et al., 2019) , no doubt, there are many old people who will face the risk of infected with COVID-19 with the globalization and aging population, which imposing a heavy burden on the public and health care systems in the world. Furthermore, the clinical clues that an infection might be present in an older person include fever and some obvious clinical signs, such as fever, cough, and rales, the elder patients may have typical or atypical presentations of infection as that described by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) (High et al., 2009) , how about the COVID-19 infection? Given that, we collected the data on the 60 older patients infected with laboratoryconfirmed COVID-19, described and analyzed the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the older patients with COVID-19 infection.

A mild case was defined as a confirmed case with fever, respiratory symptoms and radiographic evidence of pneumonia. While a severe case was defined as a mild cases with dyspnea or respiratory failure. Only laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection was enrolled in this study, laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 was detected in the first admission hospital and verified by the local Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). We collected the data on the demographic, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory tests, diagnosis types, cluster cases and outcomes of COVID-19 infection in elderly patients, and categorized into three groups and compared the difference between middle aged 50-64years, aged 65-79 years and older than 80 years.

Usually, the infected older patients initially have fever, fatigue, dry cough, and gradually appear dyspnea, some patients may develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and septic shock, even die (Chen et al., 2020) . 40 % older patients have a fever, the body temperatures were between 37.3-38.0 \u2103, and the body temperature of 38.3 % patients were higher than 38.0 \u2103, only two patients were over 39 \u2103, while not all old patients had fever, 21.7 % old patients were afebrile in our study, which may be caused by old populations with low immune function. The afebrile and low-grade fever, especially older patients, may increase the difficulty to identify and diagnosis COVID-19 in clinical practice if too much attention was given to fever detection, the results same as that described by IDSA.",

The case-fatality rate was 18.8 % of older than 80 years patients in our study, and higher than it mentioned in previous study, which was mainly for the older patients got the more underlying diseases as a result of the weaker immune functions. When old populations were infected with COVID-19, prompting administration of antibiotics to prevent infection and strengthening of immune support treatment might reduce the case-fatality rate (Chen et al., 2020) .",

Latest research stated that the older patients and among those with coexisting conditions had a higher morbidity and case-fatality rate (Fauci, Lane, & Redfield, 2020; Peng et al., 2020) . COVID-19 confirmed older patients who were older than 65 years with comorbidities were at increased risk of death (Yang, Yu et al., 2020) In our study, severe patients were significantly more than mild patients in older patients, which was similar with recent study that patients have more severe symptom in elderly population (Chan et al., 2020) . Multiple factors lead to a higher proportion of elderly patients Fig. 1 . Distribution of outcomes of COVID-19 infections by age. S. Niu, et al. Archives of Gerontology and Geriatrics 89 (2020) 104058 with severe situation, such as senior, comorbidities, low immune functions and so on. There is no doubt that old severe patients are more likely to die, therefore, the clinical treatment capacity need to improve to decrease the case-fatality rate of severe patients with COVID-19 infection, and the elderly should be pay special attention. There was a 65year-old man who was afebrile and well, and noteworthy, he was an asymptomatic case, which is one of the particular features of our study. The proportion of contacted to symptomatic case in 14 days was significantly higher in aged older than 80 years group compared with the aged 65-79 years group in our study, which owing to the aged older than 80 years elderly were mostly accompanied by their families. Familial cluster of infected with COVID-19 have been reported in homes, especially without obvious symptoms. If the asymptomatic and mild cases cannot be found or ignored, they will spread the virus to others quickly. Therefore, to identify and control the infected cases, as well as early quarantine for their close contacts, especially in families are important measures to prevent transmission of the COVID-19 infection in older population. This study has some limitations. First, only the COVID-19 confirmed older cases transferred by EMS in Beijing were included, the first admission to the designated hospitals cases were not enrolled, nor other provinces or cities which dominated by imported. It would be better to cover as wide population as possible to get more accurate results. Second, the observation time of this study is 39 days, which is still short, many patients need time to further observed. However, this study represents characteristics of early stage of COVID-19 confirmed elderly in Beijing, which has practical significance for the control and research of the older patients.",
