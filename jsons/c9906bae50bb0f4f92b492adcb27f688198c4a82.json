The act of placing a private facility such as the hotel under quarantine is J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 6 riddled with legal procedures and ramifications. The fact that the vast majority of the hotel guests were from abroad, further complicated matters. That being said, the measures implemented have proven effective in mitigating a situation that could have resulted in the formation of a cluster with potential for subsequent international transmission. As such, the authors of this paper believe the specific tools used to mitigate this outbreak were: (i) the rapid action taken to quarantine the hotel, (ii) the field clinic set up outside the hotel to work closely with the staff and guests of the hotel to monitor symptoms and have a direct line of communication, (iii) close collaboration between the field clinic, hospitals and the public health authorities, and finally (iv) specific recommendations provided to other hotels with information to guests regarding how to act if experiencing symptoms corresponding to COVID-19. The cooperation of the hotel staff in this situation was commendable, providing ongoing catering, cleaning and entertainment to the quarantined guests drastically improved the moral in the hotel greatly facilitating guest cooperation with public health services.",
