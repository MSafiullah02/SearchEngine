Asia is a highly heterogeneous region with vastly different cultures and ethnic constitutions, health\u2010care systems, vaccination programs and socioeconomic developments. Rampant antibiotic resistance exhibited by respiratory pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, poverty, malnutrition, over\u2010population, environmental damage, poor public health infrastructure, failure to implement established health\u2010care interventions and host factors such as genetic susceptibility to diseases such as tuberculosis (TB) make it particularly challenging for clinicians in Asia. The increasing and worrying popularity of smoking remains a prime determinant to weakening host factors in many Asian countries particularly China where 63% of men smoke.\n1\n Background diseases such as COPD, diabetes mellitus and HIV infection (with India having the second largest population of infected patients in the world) further complicates the situation.\n2\n\n",

Common pathogens causing community\u2010acquired pneumonia (CAP) in the West include S. pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chylamydia pneumoniae and Legionella pneumoniae, with similar pathogens in Japan and Korea.\n9\n Among 955 cases of Asian adult CAP patients, S. pneumoniae (29% of identifiable pathogens), Klebsiella pneumoniae (15.4%) and Haemophilus influenzae (15.1%) were the commonest bacterial pathogens, while M. pneumoniae (11%) and C. pneumoniae (13.4%) were the commonest \u2018atypical\u2019 pathogens. Legionella pneumophilia is probably only infrequently encountered and accounted for 1.1% of cases.\n8\n, \n10\n However, Gram\u2010negative bacilli, such as K. pneumoniae, accounted for 10% of identifiable pathogens in Malaysia and Singapore.\n11\n, \n12\n\nMycobacterium tuberculosis accounts for 12.2\u201321% of CAP in Hong Kong and Singapore.\n12\n, \n13\n\nBurkholderia pseudomallei, the cause of melioidosis, accounts for 32% of the identifiable pathogens among hospitalized patients in Thailand.\n14\n\nM. pneumoniae (35.5%) and Staphylococcus aureus (41.9%) are particularly prominent in Bangladesh, Pakistan and India.\n15\n, \n16\n Although studies on the viral aetiology of CAP in Asia are scare, a recent Australian study showed that influenza, parainfluenza, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus and picornavirus account for 15% of CAP.\n17\n In addition, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus and other viruses account for pneumonia in 41.2% of patients, thereby addressing the importance of viral aetiology in Asia.\n18\n\n",

Nonetheless, it is important to register certain important facts in relation to CAP in relation to the tropics. M. tuberculosis is a highly infectious pathogen with airborne route for transmission. Eighty per cent of the global burden of TB is carried by 23 countries nearly all of which are tropical.\n19\n This is not only consequent from genetic susceptibility, socioeconomical deprivation, but also the effect of increasingly rampant HIV infection which imposes a 10\u2010fold risk for development and a higher mortality for TB among those affected.\n20\n, \n21\n Inadequate dust control, with its associated development of silicosis in Asia among miners and some builders, also predispose these populations to development of TB.\n22\n Helminthic infections, endemic in developing countries, induce a Th2 immune response which could predispose patients to development of TB.\n23\n\n",

Undiagnosed TB, sputum smear negative or extra\u2010pulmonary, is responsible for 44% of HIV\u2010infected patients dying with wasting.\n25\n The World Health Organization case definition for smear\u2010negative pulmonary TB, based on demonstration of three negative sputum smears, radiographic features of active pulmonary TB and lack of response to broad\u2010spectrum antibiotics therapy, renders 14% of otherwise treatable conditions misdiagnosed as TB.\n26\n\n",

The strategy of Directly Observed Therapy Short\u2010course (DOTS) reduces drug resistance, which is desperately important for reducing the trend of increasing resistance to currently available first\u2010line drugs.\n27\n Rifampicin is relatively expensive for the poorest countries which only use short\u2010course therapy for sputum smear\u2010positive patients. Those who are sputum negative or have extra\u2010pulmonary diseases are treated with longer regimens that include streptomycin or thioacetazone. The latter can cause severe and sometimes fatal skin reactions in HIV\u2010infected individuals, and are less effective than rifampicin\u2010based regimens.\n28\n The development of multi\u2010drug\u2010resistant to TB, defined by resistant to both rifampicin and isoniazid, is a major worry in Asia. Prevention of TB remains a top priority for Asia in light of the difficulty in treatment both in drug administration and monitoring. The use of Bacille Calmette\u2010Guerin is only able to protect against TB meningitis and miliary TB, rather than adult cases.\n29\n The ideal situation would be to develop more effective TB vaccines.",

Although resistant S. pneumoniae can still be treated with first\u2010line antibiotics such as \u03b2\u2010lactams at higher dosages, monotherapy with macrolides might not be so effective.\n38\n Findings from large observational studies suggest that current levels of \u03b2\u2010lactam resistance generally do not cause treatment failures when appropriate agents (i.e. amoxicillin, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime) and doses are used. However, discordant therapy with cefuroxime in patients with pneumococcal bacteraemia has been associated with an excessively high failure rate compared with other discordant therapies. Many experts believe that treatment failure is more likely for strains with penicillin resistance defined by MIC \u2265 4 \u00b5g/mL. In fact, these opinions are reflected by the new 2008 Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute breakpoints (formerly NCCLS) for parenteral penicillin G of susceptible (\u2264 2 \u00b5g/mL), intermediate (4 \u00b5g/mL) and resistant (\u2265 8 \u00b5g/mL) for non\u2010meningeal infections such as CAP.\n39\n\n",

Peak shedding of SARS\u2010CoV in nasopharyngeal aspirates and faeces peaks at 6\u2013 11 and 9\u201314 days after disease onset respectively. Pathologically, SARS shows diffuse alveolar damage, secondary bacterial pneumonia and giant\u2010cell and macrophages infiltration into the alveoli and lung interstitium, pulmonary thromboemboli, and small airway and airspace fibrogranulation tissue proliferation.

Generally, radiographic opacities peak between 8 and 10 days after disease onset when bilateral disease usually occurs.\n47\n Pneumomediastinum and pneumothoraces, often spontaneous (but also occur with assisted ventilation), can complicate severe cases.

Development of clinical illness may occur within 3\u201314 days but the infection can remain latent for decades. Clinical manifestations vary from totally asymptomatic to rapidly progressive septic shock with multi\u2010organ failure. Development of lobar or bronchopneumonia can be complicated by development of pleural effusion, empyema or lung abscesses (Fig. 3). Bacterial dissemination to liver and spleen with abscess formation therein, skin and soft tissue and central nervous system, bones and joints and the urinary tract can occur. Isolation of bipolar or irregular staining Gram\u2010negative rods in sputum or BAL fluid, and the use of selective culture media to identify B. pseudomallei are important diagnostically.

Salmonellosis is contracted by ingesting contaminated food or water with penetration of gastrointestinal lymphoid tissue followed by haematological dissemination to the liver, spleen, bone marrow and other parts of the body. There are four forms of pulmonary manifestations of salmonellosis. The commonest is acute bronchitis when patients present with mild productive cough.

Metacercaria then penetrate the small bowel wall through the abdominal cavity and appear in the pleural cavity 14 days after infection. Another 2 weeks later, the young worms enter the lungs where maturation occurs within several weeks to form parasitic cysts.
