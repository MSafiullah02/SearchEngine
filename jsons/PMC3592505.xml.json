The need for feature selection arises to avoid the presence of a large number of weakly relevant and redundant features in the data set. A good choice of features is key for building compact and accurate classifiers. The feature selection part that is used in[36] is the Greedy feature flip algorithm (G-flip) for skin cancer diagnosis.

(III) Homogeneity: Homogeneity measures the closeness of the distribution of elements in the gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) to the GLCM diagonal values. Homogeneity between pairs of texture patches or similarity between textured images in general can be measured by a non-parametric statistical test applied to the empirical feature distribution functions of locally sampled Gabor coefficients.

Diabetic retinopathy is one of the most significant factors contributing to blindness and, therefore, early diagnosis and timely treatment is particularly important to prevent visual loss. Diabetic retinopathy can lead to several abnormalities like microaneurysms, hemorrhages and exudates. In[39] exudate detection is investigated because it provides information about early diabetic retinopathy. Exudates manifest as hard white or yellowish localized regions with varying sizes, shapes and locations. The main cause of exudates is proteins and lipids leaking from the blood stream into the retina via damaged blood vessels. In[39] an integrated approach for extraction of blood vessels and exudate detection was proposed to screen diabetic retinopathy. An automated classifier was developed based on ANFIS to differentiate between normal and non-proliferative eyes from the quantitative assessment of monocular fundus images. Feature extraction was performed on the pre-processed fundus images. Structure of blood vessels was extracted using multiscale analysis. Hard exudates were detected using CIE color (International Commission on Illumination) channel transformation, entropy thresholding and improved connected component analysis from the fundus images. Features like wall-to-lumen ratio in blood vessels, texture, homogeneity properties and area occupied by hard exudates were given as input to ANFIS.",

Accordingly, these works are followed by GA as a feature selection step.

In[43] other kinds of features are applied for brain tumor detection. Six textural features based on GLCM have been used in[43].

In[1] , which makes use of ANFIS for automatic detection of breast cancer, the attribute descriptors are clamp thickness, uniformity of cell size, uniformity of cell shape, marginal adhesion, single epithelial cell size, bare nuclei, bland chromatin, normal nucleoli and mitoses. In[51] , three groups of features are determined. Group 1 is a 10-dimensional vector used to represent the masses, including area, average gray level intensity, contrast, coherence, compactness, elongatedness, fractal dimension, mean square deviation on the boundary, module of gradient on the boundary and entropy of gradient orientation on the boundary. Group 2 is a 10-dimension vector used to represent the MCs, including area, average gray level intensity, contrast, coherence, compactness, ratio of pits, number of holes, elongatedness, fractal dimension and clustering number. Among them, ratio of pits is the ratio of the number of pits (the concave point on the MC boundary) to the circumference and number of holes is the number of Micro Calcifications (MCs) around the current one. Group 3 is also used to represent the MCs that are regarded as a distinguished part of group 2, which involves four features: area, contrast, coherence and number of holes. In[5] , three types of methods are introduced for feature extraction. These methods are mutual correlation-based feature selection methods, gene selection criteria and the relief algorithm. Image pruning, global gray level thresholding and histogram equalization are steps of pre-processing that are used in[52] , and the feature extraction part consists of the following steps: wavelet decomposit, coefficients extraction, normalization, energy computation, coefficients reduction and, finally, feature vector. In[53] , the suspicious location of the breast masses are specified by the radiologists and then masses are accurately segmented using the fuzzy c-means clustering technique. Fourier descriptors are utilized for the extraction of shape features of mammographic masses. These shape features along with the texture features are fed to the input of the ANFIS classifier for determination of the masses as benign, lobular or malignant.",

The algorithms were compared with results from two commonly used classifiers, the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier and the Bayes classifier. The results obtained in[33] show that the best neuro-fuzzy classification system is based on a mountain clustering algorithm/ANFIS. The determined clusters centers, which are obtained from mountain clustering algorithm, are used to initialize an ANFIS. In this method, rates have been presented above 86% in comparison with the Bayes classifier (79%) and the KNN classifier (78%). The results suggest that neuro-fuzzy classification algorithms have the potential to significantly improve common classification methods for use in ultrasonic tissue characterization.

Although this work emphasizes on ANFIS as classifier, in addition, it can be used for other tasks like denoising or segmentation. ANFIS could be a good classifier for medical image classification and assist physicians for earlier diagnosis of different diseases. This classifier overcomes the drawbacks of fuzzy systems and neural networks by combining these two intelligent methods. However, like every method, it has some drawbacks. Large input data could reduce the accuracy of its performance. In addition, ANFIS performance decreases while input samples are not enough and, also, there are many nodes in ANFIS. In general, the performance of classifier depends on several factors such as size and quality of training set, the rigor of the training imported and also parameters chosen to feed to ANFIS as inputs can be influence the classifier performance.",
