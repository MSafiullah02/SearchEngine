            "text": "BACKGROUND: Under the rationale that children undergoing elective surgery are the best candidates for autologous blood donors because of their long life expectancy, aggressive donations of autologous blood, even from infants, have been reported. A number of problems are associated with the procedure, however, whereas the risks of homologous blood are very low. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: From 1987 through 2005, of 5792 patients referred to blood transfusion services at two Japanese university hospitals for autologous blood donations, 314 children younger than 16 years old served as subjects for assessment. RESULTS: Of 314 children, 7 were not suitable as autologous donors. In most cases this was due to uncooperative behavior. Over a follow-up period of 19 years, the authors encountered 53 cases (17.3%) of donationrelated problems, and this rate was higher than the 6 percent rate recorded for adult cases (316/5305). Nine children suffered crucial complications such as vasovagal reactions, and one 14-year-old boy required a vasopressor drug. Important findings were that 6 of these were first-time donors, and the amount of blood drawn was under 10 percent of their estimated blood volume. CONCLUSION: Of 53 donation-related problems, 9 (17.0%) were accompanied by marked hypotension. Drawing autologous blood from children has become easier with advanced devices; however, lessening of anxiety and tension are essential for the safety of children's autologous blood donation programs. Aggressive donation should be avoided. ABBREVIATIONS: SCD = sterile connection device; UPN(s) = unique patient number(s); VVR(s) = vasovagal reaction.",

[2] [3] [4] A few reports have been published, however, regarding donor reactions in children's autologous blood donation. Nineteen years have passed since this program was introduced in our hospital. In view of the continuing controversy about the advantage of autotransfusion, 5, 6 we attempted to keep accurate records of problems encountered during the course of autologous blood donation, to assess the significance of this method frankly. Also, a special blood bag for the facilitation of collecting blood from children with narrow veins has been introduced.",

This is mainly applicable to adult patients, however. We use criteria shown in Table 1 , which we made for donor children, taking the above guidelines into account as well. As we accumulated more experience with this program, we found that applying it to children was not so difficult, as long as they were cooperative 2 and as long as we did not have to adhere to strict criteria for selection by age or body weight. As a rule, approximately 10 percent of intravascular blood volume was drawn once a week in a bag containing citrate phosphate dextrose adenine anticoagulant, if the Hb level before each donation was 11 g per dL or more. 7 No blood was collected within 3 days of an operation. Autologous blood was stored in a refrigerator at 4\u00b0C until the operation. Blood not used within a permissible storage period of 5 weeks was therefore returned to the patient for rejuvenation, followed by another donation to secure a sufficient amount of blood at the time of surgery. This liquid storage method is called the leap-frog. 8 When the blood volume to be drawn was small, the amount of anticoagulant (blood volume, \u00a50.14 mL) was adjusted with a sterile connection device (SCD), which connects two tubes of different sizes. 8 Usually, each adult patient received 200 mg of oral iron sulfate daily; for children the dose was 4 mg per kg per day. In addition to iron supplementation, recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) was prescribed for patients with anemia who required more than 800 mL of autologous blood within a shorter donation period.",

Figure 3 shows the annual change in the number of patients. Until 1996 we saw approximately 200 cases a year, but this number doubled after that, because the first author moved from Fukushima Medical University to Iwate Medical University and promoted the program aggressively. Attention was focused on the number of children under the age of 16 years, because they are not allowed to be volunteer blood donors in Japan; this number increased gradually until 2000, and the recent proportion of children is approximately 3 percent. Over the past 19 years, the total number of children seen was 314 (256 from Fukushima and 58 from Iwate Medical University Hospital). A total of 307 of them actually donated autologous blood, corresponding to 5.5 percent of the entire set of 5612 donor patients. Figure 4 shows the number of children classified according to the clinical department they were referred to. Of 314 children, 162 were referred to cardiovascular surgery, 98 to orthopedic surgery, and 28 to general pediatrics, and 26 were categorized as miscellaneous. Autologous blood donation was not indicated for 7 children (2.2%, 7/314) and for 173 adults (3.2%, 173/5478) due to various reasons listed in Table 2 . Restlessness, excitement, uncooperative behavior, and extremely narrow veins were the main problems related to children's phlebotomy, whereas problems with adult patients were poor general condition, virus-carrier state, and retention of inserted catheter. In Japan, patients who are virus carriers are, as a rule, not candidates for autologous blood donors because of the following four main reasons: 1) the benefits of autologous blood are quite reduced, 2) mishandling of blood of those patients may transfer the infection to someone else, 3) doctors and/or nurses may suffer viral infection by pricks with needles contaminated with infectious organisms, and 4) equipment may be polluted due to torn blood bags. In contrast, the rights of patients undergoing surgery with their own blood should be highly respected. Therefore, in every hospital in Japan, autologous blood donation programs for those patients are carried out very carefully, taking into consideration the above factors. Table 3 shows the characteristics of 307 children who donated autologous blood. There were wide ranges of age, ",

Table 4 gives more information regarding these problems. Restlessness, postponement of surgery (due mainly to respiratory infection), and narrow veins were the major issues for children. For adult patients, in contrast, donor reactions and poor recovery from phlebotomy-induced anemia in spite of iron supplementation were the most common problems. Table 5 shows the details of donor reactions involving hypotension observed in nine children. It is not necessarily easy to distinguish vasovagal reactions (VVRs) from hypovolemic hypotension; however, four patients (unique patient numbers [UPNs] 6-9) might have suffered VVR in light of physiologic features such as bradycardia. Three of them (UPNs 6, 8, and 9) felt sick before completion of blood donation. The others experienced nausea or hypotension just after the procedure. This was especially notable for two children (UPNs 4 and 5), for whom hypovolemic hypotension rather than VVR might have been the cause of those symptoms. Their symptoms occurred at the fifth donation; furthermore, the amount of blood drawn at one time was more than 10 percent of the total blood volume in each of these cases. Bradycardia was not observed. Only one 14-year-old boy (UPN 4) developed a remarkably low blood pressure (49/22 mmHg). His symptoms disappeared after speedy treatment with crystalloid infusion from the drawing line with SCD, followed by a vasopressor drug (etilefrine HCl, 2 mg). Confusion or autonomic disturbances such as urinary incontinence were not observed, and none of the patients required hospitalization. Figure 5 shows the time course of changes in mean Hb level. The level usually falls gradually for 3 weeks after the first donation; this can then be followed by sideways movement. For unknown reasons, however, Hb levels decreased rapidly in two children (13- year-old boy, 27 kg; 13-year-old girl, 46 kg) in spite of sufficient iron supplementation. A fourth donation was postponed and rHuEPO (200 IU/kg) was administered. They resumed blood donations after recovery from anemia and prepared 1000 and 1200 mL of autologous blood, respectively.",

The incidence of avoiding homologous blood during the perioperative period is apparently higher than that for adult patients. Adoption of a longer donation period and a characteristically speedy recovery from phlebotomy-induced anemia enable children to secure a sufficient volume of autologous blood before surgery. These factors may explain the high rate at which they avoid use of homologous blood. 16 The following factors may also influence this observed phenomenon: 1) children have fewer acquired bleeding risks and are less likely to be on antiplatelet therapy, 2) the surgical techniques are different from those for comparable operations in adults, and 3) pediatric surgeons are more likely to use additional blood conservation techniques.",

These devices for the collection of autologous blood were introduced in our hospital in 1991 and the mean age of 277 children for the years (1991-2005) was 9.5 years, compared with 10.2 for 30 children over 4 years (1987-1990) . Because this procedure may involve venipuncture, drawing blood, and crystalloid infusion, however, it sometimes requires a significant amount of time. In cases where children have narrow veins, experience restlessness, or are in need of rejuvenation of old blood due to, for example, postponement of surgery, the procedure often requires more than 1.5 hours. When the blood collection devices were not effective, we were able to obtain the children's own blood at the time of cardiac catheter examination. In our experience with 33 children, who were placed under general anesthesia with close monitoring of cardiopulmonary function, no adverse events occurred. This procedure seems to confer a significant benefit to the patient, even from the viewpoint of costeffectiveness, 17 especially for infants and children who are likely to enjoy longevity. With the use of iron preparations alone, recovery from phlebotomy-induced anemia is faster in these patients than in adult cases. Therefore, there is little need for expensive rHuEPO for donation of autologous blood in children. 18 Of 307 children, only 2 were administered rHuEPO, 19,20 because they became progressively more anemic in spite of normal levels of iron supplementation.",

[24] [25] [26] These symptoms may occur, even if the amount of blood drawn at one time is less than 10 percent of intravascular volume. We encountered nine children who experienced these reactions; six of them were first-time donors. By immediately discontinuing the procedure, elevating the children's legs, and starting crystalloid infusion through the drawing line with the SCD, the symptoms resolved within 15 to 30 minutes. We recognized the importance of relieving their anxiety by engaging them in conversation, letting them watch television, play videos or games, or be attended to by their parents, to improve the safety and success of children's autologous blood donation. We concluded that aggressive donation should be avoided.",

We recognized that reducing the patients' anxiety and tension, and obtaining good cooperation, are essential for the safety and success of this program for children. We ought to bear in mind that the safety of autologous blood is increasingly sought by the patient and guardian population, even though the safety of homologous blood has improved substantially in recent years.",
