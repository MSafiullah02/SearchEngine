            "text": "Together with glycoproteins and glycosaminoglycans, glycosphingolipids (GSLs) contribute to the glycocalyx that covers eukaryotic cell surfaces. Gangliosides are sialic acid-containing glycosphingolipids and provide a significant part of cell surface glycans on neuronal cells. GSLs are lipids that contain a sphingoid base and one or more sugar residues [1]. Sialic acids (Figure 1) are nine-carbon sugars biosynthetically formed from N-acetylmannosamine and phosphoenolpyruvate [2, 3]. With a mean pK\nA value of around 2.6, they are more acidic than the majority of carboxylic acids and negatively charged at most physiological pH values. The name \u201cganglioside\u201d was coined by the German biochemist Klenk (1896\u20131971) and assigned to a group of acidic GSLs that he isolated from ganglion cells [4, 5] and from the brains of patients who suffered from the so-called amaurotic idiocy [6, 7]. Sialic acid was first isolated from submaxillary mucin in 1936 [8]. Its structure was elucidated in the nineteen fifties by different groups and it was found to be identical to that of the N-acetylneuraminic acid isolated by Klenk and Faillard. The first structure of a ganglioside was elucidated in 1963 by Kuhn and Wiegandt [9]. In 1962, Svennerholm suggested a nomenclature of brain gangliosides [10, 11]. The biochemical defects underlying the diseases formerly known as amaurotic idiocy, GM1-gangliosidosis [12], Tay-Sachs- [13], and Sandhoff disease [14] were identified by Sandhoff and others in the 1960s.",

            "text": "The nomenclature of GSLs specifies the glycan part of these lipids. Two ganglioside nomenclature systems are currently in use to assign names to the corresponding structures. Most researches prefer the short-hand nomenclature according to Svennerholm, which was initially based on the migration order of ganglio-series gangliosides in chromatography [10]. Later on, it has been extended to other root structures. The more comprehensive IUPAC system [22] is less frequently applied. According to Svennerholm, a core structure of neutral sugars define the name of a respective series, in which the pyranose forms of D-galactose (Gal), D-N-Acetyl-glucosamine (GlcNAc), or D-N-Acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) are attached in defined order and linkage to lactosylceramide (Gal\u03b21,4Glc\u03b21Cer) or \u03b2-galactosylceramide (Gal\u03b21Cer). The names contain information about the series (\u201cG\u201d = ganglio, \u201cL\u201d = lacto), the number of sialic acids (\u201cA\u201d = 0, \u201cM\u201d =1, \u201cD\u201d = 2, \u201cT\u201d = 3, \u201cQ\u201d = 4, \u201cP\u201d = 5, \u201cH\u201d = 6, \u201cS\u201d = 7), and, indirectly, on the number of uncharged carbohydrates: initially it has been assumed that this number cannot exceed 5, so that the name \u201cganglioside GM1\u201d indicates that this ganglioside contains (5 \u2212 \u201c1\u201d = 4) neutral sugars of the ganglio series. This series is defined by the sequence Gal\u03b21-3GalNAc\u03b21-4Gal\u03b21-4GlcCer. Sialic acids can be attached once, twice, or severalfold to different positions within the core structures. Most often, they are found in \u03b12,3-linkage to the \u201cinner\u201d or \u201couter\u201d galactosyl residue, and in \u03b12,8-linkage to other sialic acids. Ganglioside GM1 bears one sialic acid moiety connected to the 3-OH-group of the galactosyl residue in position II of the gangliotetraose moiety (see also Figure 7). The corresponding IUPAC-IUBMB short-hand name is II3Neu5AcGg4Cer. Structures of ganglio-series gangliosides can also be derived from the scheme of ganglioside biosynthesis (see below; Figure 12). In general, ganglio-series GSLs of the 0-series bear no sialic acids on the galactose in position II, of the a-series bear one, of the b-series bear two, and of the c-series bear three sialic acid residues. However, GM1b and GD1c have a \u201cb\u201d and \u201cc\u201d in their names, although both are 0-series gangliosides (see the scheme of ganglioside biosynthesis, Figure 12). GM4 is a gala-series ganglioside, although the \u201cG\u201d suggests ganglio series.  Figure 2 shows the structure of ganglioside GQ1b, one of the most abundant gangliosides in adult human brain (G = ganglio series, Q = 4 sialic acids, 5 \u2212 1 = 4 neutral carbohydrate residues, and b-series = 2 sialic acids attached to the \u201cinner\u201d galactose).",

For gangliosides of echinoderms [38\u201342], there is no systematic short-hand nomenclature. They show structural features uncommon to mammalian gangliosides, such as sialic acid residues within the oligosaccharide moieties (e.g., LG-2, Figure 5), \u03b12,11-linked sialic acids (e.g., LLG-5, Figure 5), sialic acid methylation or sulfation, or a glycosyl inositolphosphoceramide core, for example, [43, 44]. In cultured neurons, echinodermal gangliosides show neuritogenic and growth-inhibitory activities. In this regard, they are more potent than other gangliosides [45, 46] and potentiate the neuritogenic effect of nerve growth factor.",

To specify the lipoform of a ganglioside, designations such as (d18:1/18:0)GM3 are used for a II3Neu5AcLacCer with a sphingosine (d = dihydroxy, 1 = one double bond; see also Figure 6) of 18 carbons and a stearoyl residue (18:0) within the ceramide portion. The functional consequences of the heterogeneities in the lipid component are largely unknown, but the lipid part can mask the receptor function of ganglioside glycans via interaction with membrane cholesterol [54, 55]. As another example, the ceramide portion of GM1 dictates retrograde transport of cholera toxin bound to GM1, and only GM1 with unsaturated acyl chains is sorted from the plasma membrane to the trans-Golgi network and the ER [56]. Ganglioside profiling with respect to glycan and ceramide structures is more and more in the focus of ganglioside analysis.",

In adult human brain regions, the values range from 2 to 14 \u03bcg lipid-bound sialic acid/mg protein [57]. In the brain, ganglioside expression correlates with neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, synaptic transmission, and cell proliferation [58, 59]. In cultured murine hippocampal neurons, axonogenesis, but not dendritogenesis, is accompanied by an increase in the formation of complex gangliosides and by a shift from the a- to b-series [60]. In extraneural tissues, the ganglioside content is one- to two- orders of magnitude lower than in the brain; relatively high concentrations of ganglio-series gangliosides are found in bone marrow, erythrocytes, intestine, liver, spleen, and testis, GM4 in kidney, and SSEA-4 in embryonic stem cells. Cellular gangliosides form in part complex, cell-type- and tissue-specific glycan patterns [61]. These are not stable with time, but change with physiological and pathophysiological processes such as cell growth, differentiation, viral transformation, ontogenesis, oncogenesis, embryogenesis [62, 63], lactation, or tumor progression [64]. Gangliosides of the ganglio-series are especially found in the nervous system, where they contribute to 10\u201312% of the lipid content [65]. During brain development, the ganglioside pattern changes from the prevalence of the simple gangliosides GM3 and GD3 to more complex ones such as GD1a and GT1b [66] (for structures, see Figures 7 and 11). Ganglioside content and composition of the brain change also during aging: for example, the amount of lipid-bound sialic acid decreased from 1070 \u03bcg/g wet weight in a 25-year-old healthy proband to 380 \u03bcg/g wet weight in a 85-year-old individual. Despite this, the concentrations of GQ1b, GT1b, and GD1b increase with age at the expense of GM1 and GD1a [67] (for structures, see Figures 2 and 7). Changes in ganglioside composition with age also occur in liver [68]. There are only indications on the functional consequences of such changes [23].",

Milk contains gangliosides, especially GD3 and GM3, in the membrane fraction of the fat globule. Dietary gangliosides modify the intestinal microflora and prevent infections during early infancy [100]. In infants, more than 80% of dietary gangliosides survive the passage through the stomach, in part with acid-catalyzed lactonization, and are absorbed in the intestine [99]. Ingestion of dietary gangliosides leads to an increase of gangliosides in serum. In human nutrition, sialic acid derived from gangliosides and other glycoconjugates is an essential nutrient for the rapidly growing brain in infants [59]. The pathophysiological consequences of nutritional Neu5Gc uptake are unknown.\n",

In addition to glycoforms that are also well known from glycoprotein analysis, \u201clipoforms\u201d [119] become increasingly important to understand ganglioside metabolism and function. Various protocols for ganglioside determination by mass spectrometry have been developed [101]. They are largely based on electrospray mass spectrometry as ionization technique; but also MALDI plays a role. The available methods range from preanalytics to bioinformatic data handling and include imaging methods using MALDI and Secondary Ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) to determine the spatial distribution of the analytes [101]. In addition to their constitution, little is known about the conformation of gangliosides in their native, membrane-bound surroundings. X-ray data are not available for gangliosides, although isolated glycans have been investigated by various means. For a simulation of GM3 conformations in a bilayer, compare [120], which, for example, shows that the glucose moiety of GM3 is buried within phosphatidylcholine head groups. ",

In the brain, the external supply of L-serine by astrocytes is essential for neuronal lipid biosynthesis and brain development [128].

During salvage, also other sphingoid bases are acylated by N-acyltransferases of the lass family. Lass 1 encodes ceramide synthase 1, which is expressed in the brain and involved in the formation of the membrane anchor of gangliosides. In mice, spontaneous recessive mutations in the lass1 gene are associated with cerebellar ataxia and Purkinje cell degeneration [132]. Although the ceramide part of brain gangliosides contains mostly nonhydroxylated fatty acids, apparently all members of the lass family are also able to transfer the corresponding 2-hydroxy-fatty acids [133]. Dihydroceramides are dehydrogenated to ceramide by the dihydroceramide desaturase des1 [134], or hydroxylated to phytoceramides by des2. Ceramide is the common precursor of GSLs and sphingomyelin and is transported to the Golgi apparatus at least in part in a protein-dependent manner by the transport protein CERT [135\u2013137]. ",

Therefore, reaction rates can become independent of the reaction volume and obey two-dimensional enzyme kinetics. This means that kinetic constants can be normalized on lipid surface area instead of reaction volume, for example, in terms of the amount of membrane protein [157]. As a consequence, glycosyltransferases that lack their transmembrane domain lose most of their activity towards membrane bound substrates [158]. During degradation in endosomes and lysosomes, the glycosidases are soluble enzymes, and the substrates are membrane-bound. This explains in part the requirement for endosomal and lysosomal lipid-transfer proteins for the degradation of GSLs with short glycan chains, which is not the case in biosynthesis. In addition to ganglioside biosynthesis in the Golgi apparatus, there are also indications ganglioside formation by plasma membrane-associated glycosyltransferases [159].",

Most gangliosides are biosynthetically derived from GlcCer; only ganglioside GM4 is derived from GalCer. Ganglioside GM4 has been discovered as a minor component of human brain gangliosides [161], where it is localized within myelin [162]. It also occurs, for example, on erythrocytes, kidney, and in the intestine and is abundant in some fish species. However, the most frequently found members of the gala series are GalCer and sulfatide (GalCer-3-sulfate) in oligodendrocytes, Schwann cells, kidney, testis, and intestine. They are present in high concentrations in the multilamellar layers of the myelin where they are required for glial adhesion [163], apparently via interaction between the carbohydrate head groups of sulfatide and GalCer on different myelin layers [164]. Myelin lipids contain the highest fraction of 2-hydroxy-fatty acids, which are formed by fatty acid hydroxylase-2 [165]. Their presence in gala-series GSLs contributes to carbohydrate-carbohydrate interactions between the GSLs [166]. ",

In contrast to most glycosyltransferases in ganglioside biosynthesis, which are type II transmembrane proteins, ceramide galactosyltransferase is a type I transmembrane protein with the catalytic domain on the luminal side of the ER [171]. According to data obtained in zebrafish and mice, GM4 can be formed by ST3Gal V, which can also make GM3. Therefore, GM4 and GM3 formation appear to depend on the availability of their precursors, GalCer and LacCer [172]. Little is known about the function of GM4. It can interact with the myelin basic protein, shows immunosuppressive properties, and can prevent experimental allergic encephalomyelitis in guinea pigs [173].",

            "text": "The first step in the biosynthesis of most gangliosides is the transfer of a glucose residue from UDP glucose to ceramide catalyzed by UDP-glucose:ceramide glucosyltransferase [174, 175]. Although GlcCer and GalCer synthases catalyze similar reactions, their cDNAs share no sequence homology. Ceramide glucosyltransferase is a type III transmembrane protein. It forms noncovalent dimers or oligomers [176] with their C-terminal catalytic domains in the cytosol [177]. Since the formation of GlcCer occurs on the cytoplasmic face [178] and that of LacCer on the luminal site of the Golgi membrane [179], glucosylceramide has to be translocated across a membrane. This is mediated by a flippase of unknown identity: the ABC-transporters, ABC-B1 and -C1, translocate short chain GlcCer analogs through the Golgi membrane [180, 181]. Transversal translocation can be carried out after transport of GlcCer by the cytoplasmic lipid-transfer protein FAPP2 (four-phosphate adaptor protein 2) either to the ER [182], where it might be translocated by an uncharacterized flippase [183], or at the trans-Golgi [184]. A part of the GlcCer pool can reach the cytosolic leaflet of the plasma membrane where it can be degraded by the \u03b2-glucosidase Gba2 [185]. Candidate cytosolic GlcCer-transporters are the glycolipid transfer protein GLTP and FAPP2.",

These mice are not able to form GM3 and higher gangliosides of the a\u2013c-series.

They are abundant in fish brain, and in adult rats; they occur in liver, kidney, and pancreas [190] and in tumors such as glioma. The transferases that catalyze the first steps in ganglioside biosynthesis show high specificity towards their glycolipid substrates. The relative amounts of LacCer, GM3, GD3, and GT3 seem to determine the amount of 0-, a-, b-, and c-series gangliosides. The glycosyltransferases that act late in this pathway represent a kind of assembly line and transfer the respective carbohydrates to glycosyl acceptors that differ only in the number of sialic acid residues bound to the \u201cinner\u201d galactose residue. The complex \u201c\u03b1-\u201dgangliosides with sialic acid moieties in \u03b12,6-glycosidic linkage to N-acetylgalactosamine residues is specific for cholinergic neurons [191] and has been added later to the biosynthetic scheme [192].

A mouse melanoma cell line deficient in GlcCer and GlcCer-derived GSLs was viable and showed only minor changes in cellular morphology and growth rate. From these observations it was concluded that GSLs including gangliosides are not essential for animal survival [195]. Later, it was reported that mice with targeted disruption of the ceramide glucosyltransferase gene displayed no cellular differentiation beyond the primitive germ layers and died around day 7.5 of embryonic development [62]. Mice deficient in B4GalNT I (GM2-synthase) are not able to form GM2, GD2, and higher gangliosides derived from them. Although these animals show only subtle impairment of brain function [196], they exhibit multiple defects, such as axonal degeneration, defects in myelination [197] and motor function [198], or an impaired response of T cells to interleukin 2 [199], only to mention a few. Later studies showed that CD4- and CD8-positive T cells require different ganglioside subsets for activation [200]. The mutant male mice are sterile and also show morphological and functional defects in the testis [196]. Further examination of GalNAc-transferase deficient mice revealed that GM1-deficiency is accompanied by Parkinson-like symptoms, which could be rescued by L-Dopa or the membrane permeable GM1-analog Liga20 (see Figure 19) [201]. This is in agreement with a series of reports that GM1 can alleviate symptoms in models of Parkinson disease, for example, [202]. In Parkinson disease, anionic lipids and especially GM1 inhibit aggregation of \u03b1-synuclein to cytotoxic fibrils [203].",

            "text": "Sphingolipid biosynthesis is a highly regulated process and also coordinated with sterol and glycerolipid biosynthesis. Sphingolipids are major regulators of lipid metabolism and activate sterol-regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) [206]. The sphingomyelin synthase-related synthase, the ceramide transporter CERT, and proteins of the orosomucoid- (Orm)-familie seem to play key roles in sphingolipid homeostasis [207]. Ganglioside pattern are characteristic for a cell type in a certain differentiation state, and, for example, mice deficient in GM3-synthase that cannot form the typical brain gangliosides show a ganglioside content similar to that of normal animals [189]. How exactly the relative amounts of gangliosides are controlled is not clear [208], but the transcriptional regulation of transferase genes seems to be a key point [208]. The picture gets more complicated by the fact that different transferase isoforms with different properties can be present: three murine GM3-synthase isoforms that arise from two transcripts have been characterized. One is resident in the ER membrane, the two others in the Golgi, but with different half-life [209]. In addition, the kinetic parameters of the transferases, their topological organization within the Golgi apparatus, or spatial neighborhood to other transferases will influence the resulting ganglioside pattern. An attempt has been made to calculate glycolipid pattern on the bases of the kinetic constants of the transferases, that were estimated from the steady state concentrations of the glycolipid substrates in intact cells [210]. Contradictory results have been reported on the subcellular localization of the glycosyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of ganglio-series gangliosides [211]. An additional feature of ganglioside biosynthesis and its regulation [212] is the formation of functional complexes, as predicted by Roseman [213]. In these complexes [140], the glycosyltransferases do not only form functional platforms, but can also show altered activity and suborganellar localization [214]. One of these complexes characterized in certain CHO cells [215] comprises B4GalNT I and B3GalT IV (Figure 12), so that it can accept GM3 and release GM1. This might explain why the brain contains large amounts of GM1 and GD1a, but little GM2. Also GalT I, ST3Gal V, and ST8Sia I can form such a complex [216].",

Even the nuclear envelope contains sialidases, with Neu3 in the inner and Neu1 in the outer nuclear membrane [220]. Lysosomal ganglioside degradation takes place after the endocytosis of parts of the plasma membrane at intraendosomal and intralysosomal membranes and related lipid aggregates. This requires the presence of suitable glycosidases [221], of an appropriate pH, in some cases also of lipid-transfer proteins, and of an appropriate composition of the ganglioside-containing membranes [222].",

            "text": "As proposed in 1992, two different membrane pools are present in endosomes and lysosomes [223] (Figure 15). They differ in lipid- and protein composition and function. While the luminal membrane pool that is derived from the plasma membrane or by autophagy is degraded, the perimeter membrane (Figure 15) is protected from degradation by various means [224]. This ensures the integrity of the compartment, which can be abolished during apoptosis [224]. A marker lipid that is exclusively found in luminal membranes [225] is bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP; Figure 14), chemically incorrect also named as lysobisphosphatidic acid (LBPA). BMP plays a key role for membrane degradation [226] and is formed from phosphatidylglycerol [227]. Due to its sn1, sn1\u2032 configuration, it is only slowly degraded by lipases and persists on inner membranes, in which it can amount up to 70% of total phospholipids [228]. With a predicted pK\nA value of about 2, BMP is negatively charged even at lysosomal pH. In vitro studies show that negatively charged lipids are required for binding of lysosomal proteins to membranes. Although other negatively charged lipids such as dolichol phosphate or phosphatidylinositol can be present on luminal membranes, BMP appears to be the key factor that distinguishes this membrane pool from the perimeter membrane. On the other hand, the perimeter membrane of endosomes and lysosomes shows an entirely different lipid and protein composition. It is protected by a glycocalyx formed by highly N-glycosylated integral membrane proteins [229, 230], and ganglioside GM3 present in this membrane is resistant to degradation [231].",

            "text": "Ganglioside degradation starts with the action of glycosidases that cleave off monosaccharide units from the non-reducing end of the ganglioside glycan chains. This happens in a sequential manner, which explains the different human diseases that are associated with defects in this pathway. The glycosidases are soluble enzymes in the lumen of endosomes and lysosomes. It turned out that their activity is not sufficient towards GSL substrates with cleavage sites in proximity to the intralysosomal membrane surface. Although also other factors play a role, this can be attributed to steric hindrance by adjacent membrane components that impede the access of the soluble enzyme. For example, in wild-type and GM2-activator deficient fibroblasts, radiolabelled GD1aGalNAc (Figure 3), which has the same terminal trisaccharide as GM2, is degraded in the absence of the GM2-activator protein, while the degradation of GM2 itself is strictly dependent on the presence of the activator [232]. As glycosidase substrates, GSLs with four carbohydrate residues or less require the additional presence of small lipid binding glycoproteins, either the GM2 activator protein or one of the four saposins A\u2013D. These act in part as lipid-transfer proteins that extract the membrane-bound substrates and present them to the hydrolases. They have different specificities and mechanisms of action [233]. In the case of gangliosides, at least the GM2-activator protein and saposin-B participate in the degradation of GM1, GM2, and GM3 (Figure 16). ",

BMP also increases the ability of the GM2 activator to solubilize lipids [236] and stimulates the hydrolysis of membrane-bound GM1 by GM1 \u03b2-galactosidase [237] and of ganglioside GM2 by \u03b2-hexosaminidase A [236]. BMP also stimulates hydrolysis of the kidney sulfatide with ganglio-series GSL-core SM2 (gangliotriaosylceramide-II3 sulfate) by \u03b2-hexosaminidases A and S in the presence of the GM2 activator [238, 239]. Cholesterol, which is known to stabilize lipid bilayers, has to be transported from intraendosomal membranes to the NPC1 protein resident in the endosomal perimeter membrane by the soluble lipid-transfer protein NPC2. In vitro, this transfer is greatly stimulated by BMP and strongly inhibited by sphingomyelin [240]. ",

            "text": "Saposins are small, water-soluble lysosomal lipid-binding and -transfer proteins of about 8\u201311 kDa molecular weight. They are derived from a common precursor protein, prosaposin, by proteolytic processing. Saposins belong to a family of proteins with conserved three-dimensional fold [241] and occur as homo- and heterodimers and -oligomers. The first saposin has been characterized in 1964 as the so-called sulfatide activator since it enables the degradation of sulfatide by arylsulfatase A [242]. Today this protein is known as saposin-B or sap-B. Saposin-B has many functions: it is a lipid-binding protein with broad specificity [243] and forms water-soluble lipid-protein complexes [244]. With respect to gangliosides, it is able to stimulate the degradation of ganglioside GM1 by GM1-\u03b2-galactosidase [237]. Studies in cultured human skin fibroblast derived from saposin-B and prosaposin-deficient patients show that it is also required for the degradation of GM3 [245, 246]. It is important to note that glycosylation of saposin-B is essential for some of its functions and that human patients without this postranslational modification die, although the unglycosylated variant protein is present in lysosomes [235].",

This is accompanied by a change to the closed conformation in which the ligand is exposed to the degrading enzyme in a water-soluble activator-lipid complex. Human patients with an inherited deficiency of saposin-B develop an atypical form of metachromatic leukodystrophy with the accumulation of sulfatides, digalactosylceramide, and globotriaosylceramide [248] (see Figure 16 for structures).

Based on the X-ray structure [252, 253] and data from photoaffinity labeling [254], in some respects the GM2-activator acts in a way similar to saposin-B. A more detailed picture of the binding mode was derived from binding studies using a spin-labelled GM2 activator to phosphatidylcholine bilayers [255]. The protein can extract a variety of lipids, which has been exploited for assay development [256]. However, its major function is to form a water-soluble GM2-protein complex that is the native Michaelis-Menten substrate of \u03b2-hexosaminidase A [250]. Negatively charged lipids such as BMP, dolichol phosphate, or phosphatidylinositol increase the extraction efficiency towards GM2 [236], GM1 [237], and other lipids [257] from liposomal membranes.

In addition to its function as a ganglioside-transfer protein, the GM2 activator binds also other lipids like phosphatidylcholine [259] and platelet activating factor (PAF) and inhibits its action [260, 261]. It is not clear whether the GM2 activator displays inherent hydrolytic activity towards lipid substrates such as platelet activating factor [262] or phosphatidylcholine [259]. Apparently unrelated to its GM2 transfer property is the function of the GM2 activator as adipokine [263]. GM2-activator orthologs might serve different functions in other organisms, for example as a pheromone-binding protein in Drosophila [264], or an inhibitor of PAF-induced chemotaxis in nematodes [265].",

In mice, the substrate specificity of the murine lysosomal sialidase allows for a significant cleavage also of the sialic moiety in GM2 (to yield GA2) [272]. Cleavage of the GalNAc residue requires the presence of the GM2-activator protein in vivo, or of an appropriate detergent in vitro. Three gene products participate in GM2 hydrolysis, the \u03b2-hexosaminidase \u03b1- and \u03b2-chains, and the GM2-activator protein. \u03b2-Hexosaminidases are dimers that result from the combination of their \u03b1- and \u03b2-subunits and differ in properties such as stability and substrate specificity. \u03b2-Hexosaminidase A with subunit composition \u03b1,\u03b2 cleaves terminal \u03b2-glycosidically linked N-acetyl-glucosamine and N-acetylgalactosamine residues from negatively charged and uncharged glycoconjugates by a retaining double-displacement mechanism. The enzyme has two active sites, one on the \u03b1-chain and the other on the \u03b2-chain [273]. \u03b2-Hexosaminidase B (\u03b2\u03b2) [274, 275] predominantly cleaves uncharged substrates such as GA2 and oligosaccharides with terminal N-acetyl-hexosamine residues (see also Figure 16). \u03b2-Hexosaminidase S (\u03b1\u03b1) is thermolabile and of secondary significance for GM2 degradation, but it contributes to the degradation of glycosaminoglycans and sulfated glycolipids [238].",

Affected children are normal at birth and show first symptoms, such as mild motor weakness, a cherry red spot in the central retina, and increased startle reaction between 3 and 6 months of life. Progressive deterioration with weakness, hypotonia, or poor head control leads to a vegetative state and death often between the second and fourth year of life. Juvenile and adult course is observed in patients with a higher residual activity of the variant hexosaminidase A [285]. Symptoms are very heterogeneous; for a clinical description, compare [305].",

As it turned out, the B1 variant differs enzymatically from the B variant by an altered substrate specificity of the variant \u03b2-hexosaminidase A. While uncharged substrates are cleaved, no activity is detected towards GM2 and towards sulfated, negatively charged [312] synthetic fluorogenic substrates. In the B1 variant, the function of the \u03b1-chain active site is defective, but subunit association, enzyme processing, and the activity of the \u03b2-chain are not impaired.

As in other sphingolipidoses [281], the corresponding (more toxic) lysolipid, in this case lysoGM2 (Figure 18), is elevated [315, 316] and contributes to the pathogenesis. LysoGM2 has been suggested as a biomarker for Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff disease [317]; for occurrence and role of lysoGSLs in acquired diseases, compare [318]. Despite naturally occurring animal models of GM2 gangliosidoses in dogs, cats, and pig, murine models are used for therapy studies. Since the mouse model of Tay-Sachs disease is largely asymptomatic, the mouse model of Sandhoff disease is used for most studies [272].",

The most prominent example is GM1 as the receptor for cholera toxin [379]; other examples are the toxin of Clostridium botulinum and the SabA adhesin of Helicobacter pylori [380] that bind to cell surface gangliosides of the host [381]. Binding of sialylated cell surface glycoconjugates to Siglecs [382] on white blood cells is used within innate and adaptive immune responses to distinguish between self and nonself and to dampen autoimmune responses [383]. Many pathogens use sialic acids on cell surface glycoconjugates for cellular entry, for example, periodontal pathogens [384]. Recent examples include ganglioside GT1b, which seems to be the host cell receptor for the Merkel cell polyomavirus [385]. This virus has been identified as the cause of Merkel cell carcinoma, an aggressive type of skin cancer. Also sialidase-insensitive rotaviruses recognize sialic acid, for example, on ganglioside GM1, which is not substrate of all sialidases due to its branched structure [386] and the glycan present in ganglioside GD1a serves as host receptor for the adenoviruses that cause epidemic keratoconjunctivitis [387].",

Also investigations in human patients [277], genetically engineered mammals [391], and other organisms [392] allowed insight into various aspects of ganglioside metabolism and transport. Also mutant and silenced cells have been applied for functional studies. In vitro systems such as liposomes or planar monolayers allow investigations that are to difficult to be carried out in cells. For example, when GM3 is incorporated into liposomes, a phase separation into GM3-rich and GM3-poor phases occurs above a certain GM3 content [393].

            "text": "Ganglioside total synthesis is a time-consuming and demanding task and usually performed only in specialized laboratories for examples, see [49, 50]. It relies predominantly on the sequential glycosidation of a 3-O-protected azidosphingosine [404] with suitably protected and activated glycosyl donors. This includes the trichloroacetimidates [405] as well as methods for \u03b1-selective sialylation reactions [406]. Also chemoenzymatic procedures have been developed, where different glycosidation steps are catalyzed by glycosyltransferases [407] or glycosidases [408], or where oligosaccharyl fluorides are coupled to native or fluorescent ceramide anchors using an engineered endoglycoceramidase (glycosynthase) [49, 409]. Ganglioside oligosaccharides, such as those of GM3, GM2, GM1, GD3, and GT3, can be produced by genetically engineered bacterial strains. For the biotechnological production of ganglioside head groups, lactose can be internalized in E. coli as a precursor to be used as acceptor for glycosyltransferases [410\u2013415]. An application of the ganglioside biosynthetic machinery is the preparative production of neoglycolipids with ganglioside head groups using a lung squamous-cell carcinoma line (RERF-LC-A) and 12-azidododecyl \u03b2-lactoside as a suitable primer [416].",

Initially, both methods give rise to ganglioside aldehydes, which are not isolated but subsequently fragmented by alkaline treatment, or, if desired, are isolated for further applications [424]. The glycan part can also be released enzymatically by ceramide glycanase [425, 426]. Lysogangliosides that lack the acyl moiety at the sphingosine nitrogen can be prepared by chemical procedures [427, 428], or by enzymatic treatment of gangliosides with sphingolipid N-deacylase [429\u2013431].",

With the aid of radiolabelled [438] and spin-labelled gangliosides [307] (Figure 21), three modes of adherence have been distinguished: 60\u201390% of the exogenous ganglioside consist in loosely associated micelles and also monomers, which can be removed by delipidated serum proteins. A second fraction is attached to cellular proteins in a trypsin-labile fashion, and, finally, a trypsin-stable fraction is presumably inserted into the plasma membrane of the cell. Only the last fraction is in the topologically correct, native orientation. When bound to proteins, the offrate of gangliosides with native alkyl chain lengths can be very low. This is not the case for synthetic, semitruncated derivatives of higher solubility, which are frequently used, but show different intracellular transport behaviour compared to native gangliosides [420]. Fluorescently labelled glycosphingolipids [439] have been applied, but also their properties can differ significantly from the ones of native glycosphingolipids.",
