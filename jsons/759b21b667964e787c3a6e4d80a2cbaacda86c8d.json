These loci were tested on 48 individuals from Anhui Province of China, and all loci were highly polymorphic. The mean number of observed alleles per locus was 13.6 (range from six to 27). Observed and expected heterozygosity values ranged from 0.364 to 0.957, and from 0.676 to 0.951, respectively. After Bonferroni correction, four loci deviated significantly from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. No pairs of loci were in linkage disequilibrium. These polymorphic markers will be used to examine population structure and genetic diversity in this species.",

            "text": "The western long-fingered bat (Miniopterus magnater) is an insectivorous and gregarious species, widely distributed over northeast India, southeast China, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, Malaysia, Sumatra, Java, Timor (Indonesia), Borneo, McLucas and New Guinea, including the Bismarck Arch (Simmons 2005) . In China, this species has been found in Anhui, Hainan, Fujian, Guangxi and Guizhou Provinces, among others (Zhang 1999) . Field surveys indicate that these bats usually congregate in moist and dark places, such as caves or man-made structures. Coronavirus has been isolated from this species (Poon et al. 2005) , which has implications for human health in regions where humans may come into contact with bats. However, to date, very few studies have been carried out on this species, and so little is known about its population structure, genetic diversity, and migration and roosting habits. Development of appropriate molecular markers will greatly facilitate such research. Here, we describe 10 microsatellite loci that were isolated from M. magnater, in order to study population structure and genetic diversity of this species.",
