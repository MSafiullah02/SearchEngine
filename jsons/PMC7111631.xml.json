It was first detected in Hong Kong in 2012 (Woo et al., 2012). In early 2014, outbreaks of PDCoV were announced in swine populations in Ohio, Illinois, and Iowa, and it rapidly spread to multiple states in the United States (Li et al., 2014, Marthaler et al., 2014a, Marthaler et al., 2014b, Wang et al., 2014a, Wang et al., 2014b). Thereafter, PDCoVs were detected or caused outbreaks in Korea (Lee et al., 2016, Lee and Lee, 2014), China (Dong et al., 2015, Song et al., 2015, Wang et al., 2015) and Thailand (Janetanakit et al., 2016, Madapong et al., 2016), posing significant economic concerns and gaining considerable attention (Jung et al., 2016, Lorsirigool et al., 2016, Zhang, 2016).",

Its genome is approximately 25.4 kb in length, making it the smallest genome among the known coronaviruses (CoVs). The genome arrangement of PDCoV is similar to those of other CoVs with the typical gene order: 5\u02b9UTR-ORF1a-ORF1b-S-E-M-NS6-N-NS7-3\u02b9UTR (Song et al., 2015, Woo et al., 2012). Although the biological functions of PDCoV-encoded proteins have not been studied in detail, based on studies of other known CoVs, PDCoV ORF1a and ORF1b probably encode two viral replicase polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, which are predicted to be proteolytically cleaved into 15 mature nonstructural proteins responsible for viral replication and transcription; ORFs S, E, M, and N encode viral structural proteins, Spike (S), Envelope (E), Membrane (M), and Nucleocapsid (N), respectively (Chen et al., 2015a, Lee and Lee, 2014, Li et al., 2014, Woo et al., 2010). Additionally, NS6 and NS7 each encode a putative accessory protein (\nFig. 1A).",

Although coronavirus accessory proteins have generally been considered to be dispensable for viral replication in vitro (Haijema et al., 2004, Yount et al., 2005), extensive functional studies have shown that many accessory proteins are involved in immune modulation (Kopecky-Bromberg et al., 2007) and viral pathogenesis in vivo (De Haan et al., 2002).

            "text": "A vital feature of coronavirus transcription is the set of sgRNAs produced by discontinuous transcription. Each sgRNA contains a common 5\u02b9 leader sequence derived from the 5\u02b9 end of the viral genome and a so-called \u201cbody\u201d sequence, which represents sequences from the 3\u02b9-poly(A) stretch to a position that is upstream of each genomic ORF encoding a structural or accessory protein (Sawicki et al., 2001, Sawicki et al., 2007). The fusion of leader and body sequences is processed, at least in part, by cis-acting elements termed transcription regulatory sequences (TRSs) (Hussain et al., 2005, Sawicki et al., 2007). Thus, determining the junction region of the leader and body sequences can verify the existence of the corresponding sgRNAs. To identify the possible NS6 sgRNA, total intracellular RNA was extracted from LLC-PK cells infected with PDCoV, and sgRNAs were amplified by leader-body junction RT-PCR with the primers Leader-F and NS6r (Fig. 1A) as reported previously (Dye and Siddell, 2005, Hussain et al., 2005). As shown in Fig. 1B, two specific RT-PCR products of approximately 1.0 kb and 500 bp were obtained and then isolated from the agarose gel, followed by cloning and sequencing. At least 10 independent clones were sequenced. The results reveal that the two specific RT-PCR products are sgRNAs M and NS6 (Fig. 1B). Our sequence analysis of these RT-PCR products indicates that sgRNA M contains a leader sequence followed by the typical PDCoV TRS (ACACCA) (Woo et al., 2009, Woo et al., 2012), as expected for the predicted M sgRNA transcript. However, to our surprise, the leader-body fusion site (ACACCT) for sgRNA NS6 is 148 nucleotides, rather than the predicted 46 nucleotides, upstream of the AUG start codon of the NS6 gene (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, there is a nucleotide difference (underlined) in the TRS sequence (ACACCT) of NS6 compared with that of the M gene (ACACCA), indicating that the TRS utilized by the NS6 gene is non-canonical.",

This plasmid was then transformed into Escherichia coli Rosette (DE3), and gene expression was induced with 0.8 Mm isopropylthiogalac-topyranoside (IPTG). A sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis showed that the fusion protein His-NS6 was efficiently expressed in the form of inclusion bodies in E. coli, the size of which was consistent with the predicted molecular weight of the recombinant protein (\nFig. 2A). The results of western blotting assays demonstrated that the recombinant NS6 protein was specifically recognized by anti-His MAb (Fig. 2B).

Furthermore, recent studies have reported the discovery of novel accessory proteins in some coronaviruses, such as the newly identified accessory protein ORFX of bat severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronavirus (Zeng et al., 2016). For deltacoronavirus, no information on the expression, intracellular localization, function of accessory proteins or on their unique sgRNAs has been reported. Indeed, given the absence of a TRS preceding NS6 and the relatively high (0.500) Ka/Ks ratio of NS6 in Bulbul Coronavirus (BuCoV), another deltacoronavirus, it seems likely that BuCoV does not express this accessory protein (Woo et al., 2009). In contrast, a typical putative TRS preceding NS6 is present in other deltacoronaviruses, such as PDCoV, White-eye Coronavirus, and Sparrow Coronavirus (Woo et al., 2012). However, these deltacoronavirus accessory proteins have been predicted in the absence of any experimental evidence to confirm their expression during virus infection. Here, we identify the sgRNA of the PDCoV NS6 gene for the first time and provide experimental evidence to confirm its expression in PDCoV-infected cells.",

Unfortunately, NS6 sgRNA could not be detected, even though other sgRNAs including S, M, and N, were easily identified (data not shown). This result may be due to a lower sensitivity of the non-radioactive labeling technique or a lower abundance of NS6 sgRNA. Thus, we performed leader-body junction RT-PCR, which had been extensively used in previous studies (Hussain et al., 2005, Zhang et al., 2007), to examine the existence of sgRNA NS6. The advantages of this method include higher sensitivity and simplicity of operation. Moreover, it can determine the leader-body junction site of each sgRNA by DNA sequencing. To avoid interference from other high abundance sgRNAs, such as sgRNAs S and N, the reverse primer was designed to target the end of NS6 and the extension time in each PCR cycle was set as 20 s. As expected, only M and NS6 sgRNAs were amplified in our experimental conditions (Fig. 1B).",

            "text": "Unexpectedly, the location and sequence of the leader-body junction site of NS6 sgRNA did not match previous projections. The predicted leader-body fusion site for NS6 sgRNA is 46 nucleotides upstream of the NS6 gene AUG start codon; however, sequence analysis of the RT-PCR product shows that the actual site for NS6 sgRNA is located to 148 nucleotides upstream of the AUG start codon of NS6 gene. Additionally, each sgRNA contains a TRS characterized by an AU-rich section of about 10 nucleotides (the core is a hexanucleotide motif) (Bentley et al., 2013). The TRS is the fusion site of leader and body sequences of coronavirus sgRNAs (Dye and Siddell, 2005). Although the molecular mechanisms of the leader-body fusion in coronavirus sgRNAs have not been elucidated fully, accumulating evidence suggests that most TRSs are derived from the leader TRS (TRS-L), which are considered canonical TRSs, while some non-canonical TRSs are derived from the body TRS (TRS-B) (Van Marle et al., 1999, Zuniga et al., 2004). The conserved hexanucleotide TRS used by PDCoV is ACACCA, as determined for M sgRNA by our study, while the TRS of NS6 sgRNA is ACACCT, which is identical to the core sequence of TRS-B, suggesting that NS6 uses a non-canonical TRS. Similar phenomena have also been found in sgRNAs 2-1 and 3-1 of SARS-CoV (Hussain et al., 2005). The differences in TRS sequence for different sgRNAs could play a regulatory role in controlling the abundances of different mRNAs (Bentley et al., 2013, Hussain et al., 2005, Zuniga et al., 2004). It is possible that the lower abundance of NS6 sgRNA is associated with its non-canonical TRS.",

Here, we generated two MAbs against PDCoV NS6 and demonstrated that the NS6 protein could be detected in both PDCoV-infected cells and cells transfected with a eukaryotic expression construct of the NS6 gene. We also found that a similar intracellular localization distribution could be observed in both cells infected with PDCoV and those overexpressing NS6. Furthermore, the expression of NS6 could be detected at the early phase (6 hpi) of PDCoV infection. Subcellular localization analyses showed that NS6 colocalized partially with the Golgi, and predominantly with the ER complex and ER-Golgi intermediate compartment. Similar subcellular localization has also been reported for SARS-CoV ORF7a (also known as U122), an accessory protein incorporated into purified SARS-CoV particles (Fielding et al., 2004, Huang et al., 2006). It is well known that the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment is the site of coronavirus assembly and packaging (Klumperman et al., 1994, McBride and Fielding, 2012). The presence of NS6 in the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment suggests the possibility that NS6 plays a role in viral assembly and budding events. Indeed, our preliminary study found that NS6 could be detected in the purified virion by western blotting (data not shown); however, additional experimental evidence, especially confirmation with immunogold electron microscopy is required to support this idea.",

Whether PDCoV NS6 possesses this property requires further study. In addition, BLAST search revealed that NS6 proteins share no amino acid similarities with other CoV accessory proteins or known host proteins. No putative transmembrane domain and functional domain were identified by TMHMM (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM) and InterProScan (www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro) analyses, respectively. Precise functions of NS6 protein need to be yet further explored.

Both sets of cells were then fixed, followed by use in indirect IFAs with the following primary antibodies: NS6-specific MAbs (4B9) and rabbit anti-HSP90B1 (GRP94, ER marker; ABclonal) polyclonal antibody, rabbit anti-GOSR1 (GS28, Golgi marker; ABclonal) polyclonal antibody, or rabbit anti-SEC31A (SEC31, ER-Golgi intermediate compartment marker; ABclonal) polyclonal antibody (1:100 dilution in PBS). Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated donkey anti-mouse (rabbit) IgG or Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-mouse (rabbit) IgG (1:500 dilution in PBST) was then used as secondary antibodies. Cells were treated with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) to indicate the locations of the cell nuclei.
