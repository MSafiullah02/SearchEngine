Table 7 .8 contrasts the actual funding available and the funding gap. (In Chap. 4, we considered the potential economic impact on recipient countries of While the increase in funding for HIV/AIDS is a positive development, the multiplicity of donors has created problems regarding overlapping actions and conflicting conditions attached to the aid. In 2005, over one hundred Ministers, Heads of Agencies and other Senior Officials endorsed the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, an international agreement to increase efforts in harmonization, alignment and managing aid for results with a set of monitorable actions and indicators (OECD 2005) . Also in 2005, the UNAIDS Global Task Team on Improving AIDS Coordination Among Multilateral Institutions and International Donors (GTT) published a set of recommendations on how countries and multilateral institutions can streamline their AIDS-related activities. Many of these recommendations are aimed at improving the coordination of the AIDS-related activities of multilateral organizations and minimizing overlap. The recommendations build upon the principles of the \"Three Ones\" -the three principles for coordinated response at the country level: (1) one agreed HIV/AIDS action framework that provides the basis for coordinating the work of all parties; (2) one national AIDS coordinating authority, with a broad based multi-sector mandate; and (3) one ing to a 2006 UNAIDS report, more than 40% of national AIDS plans were not serving as the framework for contributions by donors (UNAIDS 2006) . More than 40% of national AIDS plans were not evaluated for cost or provided sufficient clarity on inputs and outputs, with the result that donors preferred to engage more Poor alignment of donor strategies with national efforts and poor harmonization among donor procedures for aid management are significant impediments to achieving universal access to treatment for HIV/AIDS, because of the number and diversity of organizations that have become involved in addressing the pandemic. Duplication of work and high transaction costs by individual agencies, together directly with countries (Sidibe et al., 2006) . with the absence of important learning exchanges, economies of scale and synergies, impedes the speed, quantity, and quality of the response to the pandemic (Sidibe et al., 2006) . Thus, while pursuing affordable access to medicine and expanding medical services infrastructure are both essential elements for expanding access to treatment, they form a two-legged stool. The harmonization of donor and governance processes represents a key third element in the efforts to expand access to information and treatment.",

As a result, some developing countries have more than 700 active projects and receive more than 400 missions a year, each with its own spectives, more resources, greater innovation and competition, which could reduce costs and improve program delivery.

However, even where the host government has donor coordination mechanisms in place, coordination is made more difficult when individual donors come with pre-established priorities, without involving host countries in the setting of priorities (Dekay 2004) . One clear example is PEPFAR. It has established abstinence-only as a priority, and denied funding for needle exchange programs, which are priorities for the US government that do not necessarily coincide with the priorities of host governments (see Chap. 8 for details).",

The rationale behind promoting testing is that enabling people to learn their HIV status is a first critical step in changing behavior. The CNJR trained 230 peer educators in behavioral change communication and reached out to youth through anti-AIDS clubs and sports and cultural activities. The voucher system enabled youths to go to local health facilities on designated days, minimizing waiting times. The MAP funding was used to pay for these services. This approach was more cost-effective (USD 2 per person) than using mobile units to reach these youths (USD 10 per person). It also enhanced the returns on Global Fund investments in facility-based services. In the first 4 months almost 70,000 youths were tested. About 6% tested HIV positive. The three main lessons from the CNJR campaign were (1) HIV testing is critical to modifying sexual behavior and expanding condom use; (2) better knowledge leads to greater empathy and solidarity with people living with HIV; and (3) awareness campaigns foster a culture of responsibility, trust and faithfulness among young couples (World Bank 2007) .",

The Rwandan government, the World Bank, the Clinton Foundation, the Global Fund, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the US Government/PEPFAR worked together to design, implement and monitor the treatment program. Different sites were funded by different donors (the World Bank, the Global Fund and the US Government/PEPFAR). Patients receiving treatment increased from 870 patients at seven sites at the end of 2002 to roughly 32,000 patients at 130 sites national procurement system, the World Bank and the Global Fund finance generic drugs and the US Government/PEPFAR pays for brand name drugs. The Clinton Foundation has helped to lower the prices paid for drugs and diagnostics. PEPFAR funded the \"TRACNet\" system, which uses mobile phones to transmit information. It tracks the number of patients on treatment and the drugs dispensed nation-wide, to manage the treatment program and supplies efficiently and to avoid drug shortages that would lead to interruptions in treatment. Interruptions in treatment could diminish the effectiveness of treatment by creating resistance to the drugs being used and raise costs by requiring the use of other drugs and medical treatments. Performance-based contracting and bonuses for health care staff expanded key HIV services rapidly in a relatively short time (for example, the number of HIV tests performed by staff) (World Bank 2007).",

The adult HIV prevalence rates are as follows (in alphabetical order): Costa Rica (0.6%); El Salvador (0.6%); Honduras (1.6%); Guatemala (1%); Nicaragua (0.2%) and Panama (0.9%). By 2010, the adult HIV prevalence rate may reach 2% in the region. HIV transmission in Central America is primarily associated with heterosexual sex (with the exception of Costa Rica), as in Africa and the Caribbean (World Bank 2006) . The World Bank has developed a model to help governments to allocate resources efficiently to prevent the maximum number of new infections (World Bank 2003) .

They recommended that to provide greater fiscal flexibility, the IMF should also analyze the linkages, trade-offs and policy choices required to attain the Millennium Development Goals (which include addressing the HIV/AIDS pandemic). They also proposed that evaluating exogenous shocks should be a standard feature of IMF discussions with member states, and that access to loans should be extended to countries suffering from exceptional exogenous shocks such as the onslaught of IMF and World Bank to consider revising the eligibility criteria for assistance to middle-income countries affected by the AIDS epidemic, and to find ways of ensuring that countries could expand expenditure on health and social welfare without violating conditions that impose limits on public spending (ECA 2003) .",

It provides around two thirds of all international financing for tuberculosis and malaria and close to a quarter of the global resources for AIDS. As we saw in Chap. 4, malaria prevention is a cost-effective means to prevent HIV/AIDS in areas with high malaria prevalence, because of the impact of life-expectancy on incentives to change sexual behavior to reduce the risk of HIV/AIDS. The prevalence of HIV/AIDS also has a direct impact on the spread of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB). People living with AIDS are especially susceptible to XDR-TB because of their depressed immune systems, increasing the risk that XDR-TB will spread rapidly in sub-Saharan Africa (Picard 2007). In turn, an XDR-TB epidemic could reduce life expectancy, thereby hampering HIV/AIDS prevention. Thus, it is important to attack all three diseases together.",

In response, the Global Fund opened the possibility of funding health system improvements, but this was not used often and rarely covered staff remuneration. The World Bank has proposed leaving the strengthening of health systems up to the World Bank, in order to avoid overlap. However, the World Bank itself has been criticized for poor performance in supporting and reinforcing public health services, particularly given its role, together with the International Monetary Fund, in maintaining limits on public health expenditures and wages. The Global Fund, with its narrow funding mandate, has also been criticized for not placing more conditions on the use of the resources provided and for giving into technical advisors from the World Bank and bilateral donors who oppose the exceptional nature of AIDS (Philips 2007) . and efficient the Global Fund partnership system is in supporting HIV, malaria and TB programs at the global and country level. The third area of evaluation is \"health impact\", which studies the Global Fund's contribution to reducing the burden of the three diseases. Fig. 7.12 Global fund, sector of recipients (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) The Global Fund evaluates program performance after 2 years. The Center for Global Development analyzed data on 134 of the first 140 Global Fund grants evaluated in 2006. Due to the subjective nature of the evaluation process, this analysis should be seen as an analysis of evaluation scores rather than of the actual performance of the programs. Moreover, the results were not intended to be used to influence the distribution of funding, but rather to allocate resources for oversight and risk management. The programs that scored lowest had government agencies as principal recipients, had a large amount of funding, were focused on malaria, had weak initial proposals or were evaluated by the accounting firm KPMG. Countries with a high number of doctors per head, high measles immunization rates, few health-sector donors and high disease-prevalence rates had higher evaluation scores. Poor countries, those with small government budget deficits and those that have or have had socialist governments also received higher scores. Programs in which a government was the principal recipient received significantly lower scores than those with civil society, private sector or multilateral recipients. Malaria programs were 12.9% less likely than HIV/AIDS or tuberculosis programs to receive an A. In addition, evaluation scores were slightly higher in countries with higher prevalence rates for the target disease of the program (Radelet Countries with stronger health systems and larger numbers of trained health workers were more likely to have successful programs. This suggests that the Global Fund needs to ensure greater oversight in countries with weaker systems and capacity, and underscores the importance of building strong health systems rather than focusing narrowly on short-term targets. However, evaluation scores were lower in programs where there were many other donors. This may have been due to the greater administrative and management burden placed on recipients when there are multiple donors. Alternatively, it may indicate that the incentives for strong performance are weaker when recipients have many funding alternatives",

The private sector, through domestic firms or the foreign direct investment of multinational firms, is a significant source of financing for the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS. Private charitable foundations have also become an important source of funding in the fight against HIV/AIDS. Two issues regarding private sector donors provoke controversy. One is the issue of donations of goods and services in kind by the private sector. Critics argue that such donations impede the ability of recipient governments to build their own infrastructure. Supporters argue that such donations give a boost to local efforts to build infrastructure, provided they take place in close cooperation with recipient governments. A second issue is donor reliability and sustainability, particularly with respect to donations from the private sector (although this issue is also raised regarding other sources of funding). Here, the concern is that host governments will be unwilling to integrate funding for HIV/AIDS into general revenues that support the overall health infrastructure (for example, salaries for medical personnel) unless there is some assurance that the funding will be ongoing (McKinnell 2004) .",

However, as with multilateral organizations such as the World Bank, the IMF, the Global Fund and the UN, it is important to have an overarching framework in order to ensure the adoption of best practices by individual firms and to minimize overlap between the private sector and the other players that are involved in addressing the pandemic. In this regard, there have been some important national and global initiatives. An example of a national initiative is the Commercial Market Strategies (CMS) project, which was a 5-year USAID-funded project (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) .

First, there is a need to develop strategies to work closely with suppliers and business associates to expand the network of business engagement. Second, there is a need to partner with NGOs, community, and local government to develop and fund programs and initiatives with greater reach. Third, companies should extend confidential testing and treatment programs, including monitoring of testing participation rates, access to viral load tests and, in high prevalence areas, treatment for dependents and post employment. Fourth, companies should focus on balanced prevention and treatment programs that target behavior change in conjunction with treatment. Fifth, there is a need to increase the role of business in advocacy and to extend programs into emerging markets. In particular, CEOs and senior management should provide leadership to dispel myths and stigma, break down workplace barriers and influence community change. In this regard, the GBC study concluded that the private sector can enhance their response to HIV/AIDS by treating it like any other disease and integrating responses into broader packages supporting health and well-being. Employment contracts and health benefits packages should include HIV as a normal component rather than an exception. Rather than isolating HIV/AIDS, interventions should be part of a comprehensive health system for employees and the broader community (GBC and Booz, Allen, Hamilton 2006) .",

This initiative was announced at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in 2006 by Bono and Bobby Shriver.

The social marketing approach was also used to distribute condoms and oral rehydration salts. However, it was revealed that the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) was spending 95% of its malaria budget on consultants and 5% on goods like nets, drugs and insecticide. Experiences in Kenya helped to persuade the WHO to change its policy. A 5-year study of 40 health districts revealed that a PSI social marketing scheme for malaria nets only increased coverage from 7% of the population to about 21% between 2002 and 2006. In contrast, when the health ministry got a grant from the Global Fund that allowed it to hand out 3.4 million free nets in 2 weeks, coverage rose to 67%, and distribution became more equitable. Under social marketing, the richest of the poor had 38% coverage, while the poorest of the poor had only 15%. After the distribution of free nets, they were about equal and deaths of children dropped 44%. Free distribution was also cheaper. With consultant fees, transportation, advertising and shipping, social marketing added about USD 10 to the cost of each net beyond the USD 5 to USD 7 that manufacturers charged. Even with payments to volunteers, the added cost of free distribution was only about USD 1.25",

AIDS patients need to receive treatment their entire lives without interruption in order to avoid death or creating drug-resistant mutations of HIV. Requiring patients (who do not have enough money for food) to pay for treatment reduces the effectiveness of ARV treatment, reduces adherence and decreases survival rates.

However, this network of global suppliers has been a weak link in the AIDS response. If tapped, the reach of employee and community networks could make a tremendous impact in mobilizing communities around HIV prevention and treatment.

The foundation is guided by the belief that all lives, no matter where they are lived, have equal value. With respect to global health, the foundation focuses its funding in two main areas: (1) access to existing vaccines, drugs and other tools to fight diseases common in developing countries; and (2) research to develop health solutions that are effective, affordable and practical. In developing countries, the foundation supports efforts to prevent and treat diseases and conditions that meet three criteria: (1) they cause widespread illness and death in developing countries; (2) they represent the greatest inequities in health between developed and developing countries; and (3) they receive inadequate attention and funding. HIV/AIDS is one of the foundation's priority diseases. To slow the global spread of HIV, the foundation supports the development of vaccines and other tools and strategies with the potential to prevent tens of millions of infections and deaths. The foundation also funds comprehensive initiatives that include both prevention and treatment (http://www.gatesfoundation. org/GlobalHealth/).",
