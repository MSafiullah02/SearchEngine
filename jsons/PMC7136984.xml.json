This problem was encountered by the countries most affected, governmental and non-governmental organisations, and even WHO.5 It would be invidious to highlight particular examples; in our experience, this lack of data sharing was serious in its potential effect on the early response. The Ebola outbreak was not the first public health emergency where this has occurred, even though the response to the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic showed the power of real-time data sharing in rapid public health responses.6 There are already moves afoot to ensure that key data supporting all publications in major journals are made publicly available. However, the situation of public health emergencies requires particular and urgent attention in this regard.",

Three disincentives were frequently mentioned: data sharing would jeopardise subsequent publication; it would allow pre-emptive use of data by others for their own publications; and it would breach confidentiality agreements. None of these reasons showed those involved in a good light, given an unfolding emergency with minimum systematic information on which responders could base early decisions. This unwillingness to share data threatened the lives of both communities and health-care workers, including some of those who provided the data in the first place.",
