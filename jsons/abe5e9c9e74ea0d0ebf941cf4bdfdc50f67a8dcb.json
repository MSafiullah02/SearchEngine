Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from 630 children <5 years with ARI. Clinical diagnosis and disease severity were also recorded. Samples were analyzed by multiplex PCR for 18 viral and atypical bacterial pathogens; RV positive samples underwent partial sequencing to determine species and type. RV was the fourth commonest pathogen accounting for 18.7% of pathogens detected. RV was commonly detected in children with bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and asthma/episodic viral wheeze (EVW). Species and type were assigned in 112 cases (73% RV-A; 27% RV-C; 0% RV-B). Generally, there were no differences in clinical or demographic characteristics between those infected with RV-A and RV-C. However, in children with asthma/EVW, RV-C was detected relatively more frequently than RV-A (23% vs. 5%; P \u00bc 0.04). Our findings highlight RV as a potentially important pathogen in this setting. Generally, clinical and demographic features were similar in children in whom RV-A and C species were detected. However, RV-C was more frequently found in children with asthma/EVW than RV-A.",

Traditionally, they have been divided into two species (A & B) and over 100 serotypes. In 2006, a number of novel RV strains were identified with significant variation in the viral protein (VP) regions (VP2, VP4) and 5 0 non-coding region (5 0 NCR); these formed a distinct new species that was designated \"rhinovirus C\" (RV-C) [Arden et al., 2006; Lamson et al., 2006; Arden and Mackay, 2010] . Approximately 60 RV-C types are now recognized based on phylogenetic clustering, and these viruses have been associated with severe acute respiratory infection (ARI), particularly wheezing ARIs, in young children [Lau et al., 2007; Dominguez et al., 2008; Bizzintino et al., 2011] and asthmatics [Lemanske et al., 2005; Miller et al., 2009; Calvo et al., 2010] .",

This is similar to other epidemiological studies that report the prevalence of RV of 12-26% in ARI [Jartti et al., 2004; Miller et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2010] . In our cohort, RV-C was detected in 4.7% of ARI cases over the 2 years. Another study in Brazil (S\u00e3o Paulo) in 120 children <12 years presenting as outpatients with ARI detected RV in 47% and RV-C in 28% of children [Moreira et al., 2011] . Our study differed in both age groups included (<5 years [most <1year], vs. <12 years) and setting (ED vs. outpatient). Our cohort was also from a predominantly low income background [Bezerra et al., 2011] . Our finding of 27% of RV samples being RV-C positive is comparable to similar studies in children in Spain and China that report a prevalence of 35% and 36%, respectively [Jin et al., 2009; Calvo et al., 2010] . Although we were surprised not to detect RV-B at all in our cohort, it is often only found at very low levels (0-3%) or in relatively asymptomatic patients [Loens et al., 2006; Lau et al., 2007; Dominguez et al., 2008] . This study supports others suggesting an association between RV-C and severe ARI, particularly wheezing ARI, in young children. Recent in vitro studies have shown that, in contrast to other RV species, RV-C grows optimally at either 34\u02daC or 37\u02daC, potentially allowing it to infect the lower respiratory tract as easily as the upper respiratory tract [Ashraf et al., 2013] . It is likely that other factors are also involved, however, given that we found similar rates of infection with RV-C and A in infants with bronchiolitis and a trend towards more RV-A than RV-C in children with pneumonia.",
