            "text": "Although mAbs currently constitute the main class of biotherapeutics, the possibility of using them to treat viral infections has received limited attention until recently. This contrasts with cancer and inflammatory diseases against which they are now widely utilized 1, 2, 3. This is also paradoxical if one considers that the first commercial mAb was an anti-respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) antibody used to fight a pediatric respiratory illness. This situation, however, is reversing. Indeed, a flurry of human, or humanized, mAbs against H5N1 influenza virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), Ebola virus, Marburg virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, dengue virus, rabies virus, Hendra virus, Nipah virus, yellow fever virus, and West Nile virus have been described in the past few years 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. Some of these mAbs are currently being tested in the clinic and include second-generation mAbs with improved neutralizing activity and/or novel target specificities 6, 7, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22. This is especially true for HIV, which has dominated most of the reports dedicated to broadly neutralizing mAbs during the past 2 years. Finally, antiviral mAbs have already demonstrated partial efficacy when administered after HIV, HCV, or Ebola virus established infections 11, 23, 24, fueling the idea that they represent promising, high-added-value therapeutic agents.",

In addition to complement-mediated inactivation of viral particles, and/or their phagocytosis, this also permits complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) to eliminate infected cells displaying viral antigens at their surface (Figure 1A). This, for instance, is the case of mAbs targeting the envelope glycoprotein (Env) of HIV (and other lenti-/retroviruses) that is exposed at the surface of virus-producing cells. Finally, Fc\u2013Fc\u03b3R interactions can also directly impact viral propagation via a mechanism called antibody-dependent, cell-mediated virus inhibition (ADCVI) (see 19, 25, 26, 27 for more information on direct Fc-mediated antiviral effects). Thus, during immunotherapies, mAbs can impact viral propagation via a variety of direct mechanisms, possibly varying according to the virus, the viral antigen recognized and the antibody itself. However, there is now accumulating evidence that antiviral mAbs, upon interaction with different components of the immune system, can also operate via indirect mechanisms, that is, engagement of the host immune response, with effects lasting well beyond the treatment itself. Thus, similarly to vaccine approaches, mAb treatment could lead to the stimulation of the endogenous humoral and cellular immune responses in such a manner as to provide protective immunity (\u2018vaccine-like effects\u2019).",

Such ICs can then be recognized by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells (DCs), which are central for any adaptive immune responses (Figure 1B). Surprisingly, until recently, the scientific and medical communities have largely failed to take into consideration that this could impact the endogenous immunity (i.e., the enhancement of antibody responses as well as cytotoxic T-cell responses) of infected, immunotherapy-treated patients. This is all the more puzzling as positive immunomodulatory (vaccine-like) effects, which strengthen the patients\u2019 immune defenses against viral infections, would translate into obvious benefits, not only for the patients, but also for healthcare systems that would benefit from both reduced cost and duration of treatment.",

First, most antiviral mAbs (if not all) were initially selected on the basis of their blunting effects on viral propagation. Second, models of viral infections in immunocompetent animals, allowing in-depth analyses of endogenous immune responses in the context of passive mAb-based immunotherapies, are scarce. This is especially true for relevant models of chronic infections by viruses such as HIV or HCV, against which most antiviral mAbs available to date were raised. Indeed, anti-HIV (and to a lesser extent anti-HCV) mAb activity was assessed mainly in immunocompromized, humanized mice reconstituting only partially the human immune system 28, 29, 30, 31, 32 and/or nonhuman primates (NHPs). Although NHPs are extremely useful for assessing the protective effects of anti-HIV mAbs, their use in the study of immunity is limited due to both technical and cost reasons. In contrast, mouse infection systems offer numerous immunologic tools and permit cost-effective experimentation on large cohorts. Third, most often antiviral mAbs have been generated in species different from those used in the in vivo experiments and therefore Fc-associated effector functions were not, or not fully, preserved. Finally, ethical, technical, and economic reasons, together with the low number of ongoing clinical trials, still limit this type of investigation in humans.",

However, short treatments (a few days) with a neutralizing IgG2a (equivalent to IgG1 in humans) mAb, recognizing viral Env, shortly after infection allow infected mice to survive in good health and with a normal lifespan. Survival is associated with decreased viral propagation and, importantly, is strictly dependent on the development of a life-long protective endogenous antiviral immune response. This immunity is of the Th1 type with a humoral arm directed against the virus and a cytotoxic T-cell arm directed against infected/leukemic cells, both of them displaying strong memory responses in challenge experiments. Detailed analyses indicate that the induction of protective immunity is not the mere result of the reduction of the viral load during the immunotherapy but the consequence of a genuine immunomodulatory action of the therapeutic mAb involving various Fc\u03b3R-dependent mechanisms 36, 37. In particular, the mAb induces Env-expressing infected cell lysis through a natural killer (NK) cell-dependent ADCC mechanism. This most likely provides an inflammatory environment favoring the induction of the antiviral immune response. Moreover, ICs formed with infected cells are more efficiently captured by DCs than infected cells alone, leading to stronger functional DC activation and elicitation of a potent antiviral cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response (Figure 2\n, Key Figure). Importantly, the endogenous antiviral antibodies generated by the immunotherapy allow containment of viral propagation and contribute to the maintenance of a T-cell memory response once the therapeutic antibody has been eliminated from treated mice 36, 37. A third Fc\u03b3R-dependent effect described is the inhibition of the expansion of regulatory T cells (Treg), which is essential for the induction of protective immunity [38] (Figure 2). Such a finding is, in fact, not surprising as Treg expansion is associated with all types of chronic viral infections and leads to dampening of the antiviral immune response, promoting chronicity and subsequent pathologic manifestations.",

Several reports now indicate that short treatments of SIV-infected macaques with neutralizing antibodies can lead to enhanced antiviral immunity 39, 40. However, these experiments were performed with SIV-specific, highly neutralizing, polyclonal immune globulins (SIVIG) prepared from SIV-infected animals and not mAbs. In a first study, the SIVIG treatment could both significantly delay disease onset and increase the survival rate of SIVsmE660-infected Macaca mulatta macaques, with the long-term survivors showing accelerated de novo production of anti-SIV-neutralizing antibodies [39]. In another set of experiments, rhesus macaques treated with SIVIG shortly after SIVmac239 infection resulted in transiently detectable neutralizing-antibody responses followed by reduction in viral loads as compared to untreated macaques [41]. Interestingly, a virus-specific polyfunctional CD4+ T-cell response was also induced during the acute phase of infection and maintained elevated during the following chronic phase together with a CD8+ T-cell antiviral response measured by the appearance of CTLs specific to capsid (Gag). Intriguingly, no neutralizing antibodies could be measured during the latter phase (i.e., after SIVIG had disappeared) [40], underlining a striking difference with the M. mulata macaque and FrCasE models for reasons that will have to be elucidated. Moreover, DCs stimulated in vitro with SIVIG-preincubated SIV were shown to activate virus-specific CD4+ T lymphocytes in an Fc-dependent manner, suggesting that enhanced T-cell priming during the immunotherapy period is dependent on antibody-mediated virion uptake by these APCs [41]. Such a conclusion is consistent with a former observation that MHC class I-restricted cross-presentation of SIV capsid protein (Gag) is enhanced by anti-Gag antibodies to generate stronger Gag-specific CD8+ T-cell responses in SIV-infected macaques [42].",

Interestingly, 1-month-old pigtail macaques treated with the human HIV-neutralizing mAb b12 (one of the first to be generated) combined with polyclonal SHIVIG before oral challenge with the SF162P3 SHIV strain, developed an accelerated neutralizing antibody response and showed reduced plasma viremia for at least 6 months [43]. However, in this infection model, despite very high persistent viremia, there was no evidence of pathogenesis in the 6-month period of the study precluding the assessment of viral disease protection by the mAb-induced B-cell response. In contrast, such a study was performed using oral infection of 1-month-old rhesus macaques with the same virus, which leads to disease manifestation within 12 weeks. In this model, passive immunotherapy with polyclonal SHIVIG, 24 h prior to infection, reduced viral propagation, accelerated de novo neutralizing antibody production (also translating into ADCVI), and was associated with protection from disease [44]. These data are consistent with the concept of protective immunomodulatory effects induced by passive immunotherapies with neutralizing antibodies, at least when administered at the time of infection. These effects, however, also seem possible upon mAb treatment at a much later time. For example, the administration of either a cocktail of HIV-1-specific mAbs (PGT121, 3BNC117, and b12), or of the PGT121 mAb alone, 9 months after SHIV-SF162P3 infection of rhesus macaques resulted in the rapid decline of plasma viremia to undetectable levels correlating with a slight increase in neutralizing antibody titers. Interestingly, this humoral response was complemented by a T-cell response characterized by a significant improvement of the functionality of Gag-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T lymphocytes (manifested by a decreased expression of the exhaustion marker PD-1) despite there being no change in their numbers. Moreover, if virus rebounded in the majority of animals when serum mAb had disappeared, a subset of animals maintained long-term virological control in the absence of further mAb infusions [23]. Overall, these data demonstrate a strong therapeutic effect of potent neutralizing HIV-1-specific mAb in SHIV-infected rhesus monkeys as well as a positive impact on their immune response. These findings are potentially important, as very recently the 3BNC117 mAb has been shown to be safe and effective in reducing HIV-1 viremia in a phase 1 human clinical trial [45].",

For example, the prophylactic treatment of RSV, an acute cytopathic virus, by a neutralizing mAb (131-2G) directed towards its G attachment protein (that also has strong immunosuppressive activity) can shift the adaptive immune response from the Th2- to the Th1-type [47]. Thus, 131-2G mAb-treated mice infected with the RSV r19F strain show an enhanced and sustained humoral response characterized by an increased ratio of anti-RSV IgG2a to IgG1, as compared with non-treated, infected mice. Moreover, the stimulation and skewing of the humoral response also correlate with an increase in follicular helper T cells (Tfh) and a higher frequency of CD8+ T cells directed to infected cells. It should be noted, however, that the effects on B-cell and T-cell responses are not Fc-dependent, as the 131-2G F(ab\u2032)\n2 fragment leads to the same shift of the adaptive immune response as the whole mAb 48, 49.

HeV challenge of African Green monkeys mirrors fatal human infection leading to death by day 8 post-infection. Upon rapid infusion of the human HeV-neutralizing mAb m102.4, infected monkeys survive after having transiently displayed neurologic symptoms [50]. Recovery from disease correlates with the mounting of a protective humoral immune response reducing the viral load. Interestingly, the 102.4 mAb cross-reacts with NiV and using it in post-exposure therapy of NiV-infected African green monkeys also leads to the development of an antiviral humoral response, which, most likely, both limits viral dissemination and contributes to protection from NiV disease [51]. Thus, the cross-reactive m102.4 mAb, which is currently being developed for human use as a Nipah- and Hendra-virus countermeasure [52], shows exceptional efficacy, not only because of its direct antiviral action, but probably also through its ability to affect endogenous immunity.",

A first approach might rely on inhibiting immunosuppressor mechanisms of infected, treated individuals, for example via depressing Tregs by treatments entailing either their depletion and/or loss of their activity (reviewed in [53]). This would be all the more pertinent because Treg expansion dampens antiviral immunity in a number of infections (see above). Targeting \u2018immune checkpoints\u2019 may represent another option. This could be achieved using the anti-PD-1 or anti-CTLA-4 mAbs that are currently used to treat cancer (reviewed in 54, 55. The fact that inhibiting the PD-1\u2013PD-1L interaction enhances virus-specific cellular immune responses in different animal models of HCV [56], hepatitis B virus (HBV) 57, 58, HIV [59], SIV [60], and murine retrovirus [61] infections provides support for this idea, as well as the observations that PD-1 blockade stimulates anti-HBV cellular immunity in HBV-infected patients 62, 63 and is associated with the cure of a small subset of HCV-infected patients [64].",

Alternatively, agonists of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) could be used, as, on one hand, activation of TLRs is essential for the development of many natural antiviral responses and, on the other hand, TLR7/8 and -9 agonists have already been shown to cooperate to enhance the anti-HIV-1 Env humoral response in rhesus macaques [70].

This suggests that Fc engineering could represent an avenue to not only improve direct mAb antiviral efficacy but also to induce stronger vaccine-like effects. In particular, enhancing the affinity of mAbs for the Fc\u03b3Rs displayed by APCs could be achieved via the modification of the Fc\u03b3Rs\u2019 peptide-binding motifs or via the production of mAbs with altered glycosylation (which can enhance binding to Fc\u03b3R) 78, 79, 80, 81, 82. Indeed, Fc-engineered glycovariants were shown to enhance Fc-mediated reduction of viral replication and Fc\u03b3R binding in different in vitro infection settings for Ebola virus and HIV 82, 83. Also supporting this idea, spontaneous control of HIV and improved antiviral activity correlated with a dramatic shift in the global antibody-glycosylation profile toward agalactosylated glycoforms [84]. Another interesting possibility of Fc engineering may aim at enhancing the binding to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) expressed by various adult cell types [85]. Not only could this lead to increased mAb half-life in vivo\n[85] but also to stronger vaccine-like effects. Indeed, FcRn cross-linking on APCs by multivalent ICs has been shown to entail stronger humoral and cellular adaptive responses in certain infection settings 86, 87. In addition, an enhanced FcRn function of the broadly neutralizing mAb VRC01 improved protection against SHIV infection in macaques [88].",

Most human antiviral mAbs studied so far are IgG1s that display strong affinity for both Fc\u03b3Rs and complement. However, recent data suggest that other human IgG subtypes may exert stronger antiviral effects, at least under certain conditions. Thus, IgG2 antibodies to HIV Gag have been suggested to contribute to immune control of HIV infection by broadening and enhancing the function of IgG antibodies [89]. Moreover, increased vaccine efficacy and decreased risk of HIV-1 infection, in one of two clinical trials (RV144 and VAX003), was correlated with the development of highly functional anti-HIV IgG3 90, 91, 92.",

This task will be complicated because different Fc\u03b3Rs are expressed at various levels by the different APCs and show functional polymorphism. Supporting this possibility, Fc\u03b3RIIa polymorphism represents a genetic risk factor for latent Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) infection and expression of its oncogenic latency proteins [93]. Furthermore, Fc\u03b3RIIa and Fc\u03b3RIIIa polymorphisms are associated with variations in HIV disease progression [94], and progression of HIV infection has been associated with decreased expression of Fc\u03b3RIIa [76]. In addition, Fc\u03b3RIIc polymorphism has been shown to impact HIV-1 vaccine protection [95].",

This approach would mainly concern enveloped viruses, as they display their viral receptor-binding proteins at the surface of virus-producing cells. The fact that cellular ICs are crucial for inducing long-lasting immunity against FrCasE by neutralizing mAbs (see above) [36] substantiates this idea. In addition, HIV-infected cells are stronger inducers of innate immunity than cell-free virions [96], and HCV-infected hepatocytes have been reported to affect DC maturation and the subsequent activation of NK cells and T cells, whereas free virus could not [97], indicating that infected cells may be stronger inducers of immunity compared to virions.
