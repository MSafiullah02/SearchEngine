By screening a large number of Chinese herbs (Ho et al., 2007) emodin was identified as an effective component of Polygonaceae to block the interaction of the SARS-coronavirus spike protein (SARS-CoV S protein) with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and to reduce the infection by S protein-pseudo-typed retrovirus. The ACE2 was shown to be a functional receptor for SARS-CoV (Kuhn et al., 2004, Li et al., 2003) with a specific binding domain of the S protein (Babcock et al., 2004, Wong et al., 2004).",

Expression of the protein in oocytes and infected cells had been demonstrated previously ((Lu et al., 2006), Lu et al., unpublished). Oocytes of stage V or VI (Dumont, 1972) were selected and injected with cRNA (20 ng per oocyte); these cells were stored together with uninjected control oocytes for 2 days at 19 \u00b0C in oocyte Ringer's-like solution (ORi, see Section 2.6).

Experiments with HCoV-OC43 could be performed in our Biosafety Level 2 Laboratory. HCoV-OC43 (VR-1558) was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). Virus adsorption was carried out for 1 h in medium without serum. Cells were then washed with PBS and cultured with medium supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum and various concentrations of emodin for 40 h at 33 \u00b0C. Hence the emodin was added after the virus absorption was carried out. Since the emodin stock solution was prepared in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), control experiments were conducted in the absence of emodin, but in the presence of the respective concentrations of DMSO indicating that up to 0.5% DMSO had no significant effect on virus release. Only for the highest concentration (1%), which was applied when using 100 \u03bcM emodin, an inhibition of virus release by 20% could be detected; in the presence of the 100 \u03bcM emodin virus release was completely inhibited (see Section 3.3).",

RD cells were first infected with the coronavirus HCoV-OC43 at multiplicity of infection (moi) 1, and thereafter, incubated with different concentrations of emodin (see Section 2). Three days post infection, the typical cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed under a light microscope; the virus-induced CPE was obviously reduce in the presence of 8 \u03bcM emodin (Fig. 5A). In addition, the plaque reduction assay showed that emodin decreased the number and size of plaques in a dose-dependent manner; plaques were hardly detectable at 8 \u03bcM (Fig. 5B).

The reduction of extracellular viral RNA copies by emodin reflects inhibition of virus release. At high concentrations of emodin also intracellular levels of viral RNA copies were reduced suggesting that the high concentrations may also inhibit other stages of the virus life cycle. The discrepancy between the reported K\n1/2 value of 200 \u03bcM for inhibition of S protein and ACE2 and the 80% inhibition of infectivity at already 50 \u03bcM (Ho et al., 2007) might be explained by our observation that the block of 3a protein contributes to spread of virus infection in addition to the effect on S protein/ACE2 interaction.",

Therefore, we suggest that emodin may contribute to reduced virus release from the SARS-CoV-infected cell through inhibition of the current mediated by 3a protein. Indeed, emodin inhibited HCoV-OC43 release from infected RD cells with similar effectiveness of K\n1/2\n \u2248 20 \u03bcM for inhibition of SNE-3a protein of SARS-CoV and HCoV-OC43. Reduced virus release from infected cells may provide to the immune system sufficient time to effectively respond to the infection.
