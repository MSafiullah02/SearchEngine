While sharing a common property of suppressing seizures, AEDs can be classified into different pharmacological subtypes based on the mechanism of action, tendency for drug-drug interactions, and toxicity profiles. Major mechanisms of action include alteration of sodium currents, modulation of GABAergic tone, antagonism of the NMDA glutamate receptor, alteration of calcium currents, and the binding of synaptic vesicle proteins.",

Super refractory status epilepticus (SRSE) is defined as status epilepticus that continues or recurs after the onset of anesthetic therapy and that recurs on the reduction of anesthesia [2]. Although the optimal treatment of RSE is unclear in the literature, primary therapies include midazolam, propofol, and phenobarbital. Patients in this setting should be intubated and monitored on continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) with the goal of burst suppression. Of note, prolonged use of a propofol infusion is associated with propofol infusion syndrome (PRIS), which involves rhabdomyolysis, severe metabolic acidosis, as well as cardiac and renal failure, and green urine [3]. In addition, hypotension is common with many patients requiring vasopressor support in this setting [4].",

A midazolam infusion was initiated and up-titrated to 60 mg h\u22121 but failed to achieve burst suppression, and the patient continued to have generalized epileptic discharges on EEG. The patient was subsequently changed to a propofol infusion up to 150 mcg kg min\u22121 with intermittent boluses to maintain burst suppression. Despite the addition of phenobarbital, epileptic discharge activity remained evident on EEG, and events of facial twitching and arm convulsions were observed on exam. Burst suppression was eventually achieved with the addition of a pentobarbital infusion.

These ongoing EEG findings with evident seizures when anesthesia was decreased led to further modification of the AED regimen (Fig. 1, timeline of agents used) including the addition of clobazam.

The clinical outcome raises discussion as NORSE is typically considered a life-threatening condition with mortality up to 40% [11]. Although general expert consensus in the literature recommends approaching NORSE with pharmacologic-induced coma and continuous infusion of IV anesthetic agents to suppress brain activity and preserve normal brain physiology [2], a precise roadmap to clinical neurological recovery is not described, pointing to educational value in individually described cases. The unusual outcome demonstrated here raises a discussion of optimal approach and treatment as applied to a case of NORSE where complete neurological recovery was ultimately achieved.",

The patient\u2019s CSF was tested for a panel of other antibodies against surface antigens relevant to autoimmune etiology, all of which were found to be negative with the exception of GAD65. While positivity of anti-GAD65 antibodies should not in itself be considered a cause of autoimmune encephalitis, the other clinical and laboratory findings in the case were also consistent with autoimmune etiology. These findings included a negative infectious workup, a negative paraneoplastic workup, the viral-type symptom prodrome at presentation, and the intractable resistance to AED therapy. On review of the literature, management of SE in setting of known anti-GAD65 antibody positivity is often difficult and, in some cases, irreversible [12, 13]. Case reports described by M\u00e4kel\u00e4 and colleagues (2018) have shown moderate responses to steroids, IVIg, and PLEX, but immunosuppression with better CNS penetration has been found to be more effective. Similarly, in our case, clinical response was ultimately achieved with rituximab following ineffective treatment with steroids, IVIg, and PLEX, consistent with the aforementioned reports of autoimmune-mediated SE in the literature.",

Patient prognosis remains highly dependent on the underlying etiology, and treatment regimens differ significantly, making early suspicion in either direction of great importance. It has been suggested that autoimmune etiology is associated with certain clinical features such as younger age of onset (< 50), female sex, psychosis, and super-refractory SE, in addition to lymphocytic predominance in CSF. In contrast, other features such as high CSF portal protein, pleiocytosis and reduced glucose ratio are associated with infectious etiology [14]. Raising suspicion based on these factors early on in a hospital admission can help guide rapid initiation of appropriate therapy to achieve clinical response and neuroprotection. Notably, although CSF analysis can be helpful in this distinction, in the case of anti-GAD65 antibody\u2013mediated autoimmune epilepsy, lack of response to IVIg and PLEX has been shown to be to typical [16, 17] and possibly diagnostic. Given that the prevalence of autoimmune and infectious status epilepticus are similar, factors that facilitate early clinical suspicion for either process are valuable for ICU physicians in the rapid initiation of appropriate empiric therapy.",

GAD65-mediated epilepsy is also typically more refractory to therapy, as demonstrated in our case, and carries a poorer prognosis when compared with neuronal cell surface/synaptic autoimmune epilepsy (e.g., mediated by anti-NMDAR, GABAR, LGI1 [15]). These elements of GAD65-mediated autoimmune epilepsy are consistent with our clinical scenario in addition to the fact that our workup was negative for paraneoplastic causes. Furthermore, it has been suggested in the literature that in contrast to other autoimmune-mediated epilepsies, GAD65 antibody\u2013mediated epilepsy is less responsive to standard AEDs and to immune therapy with steroids, IVIg, and PLEX, and that treatment with aggressive immunosuppressants such as rituximab is necessary to achieve clinical response [16, 17] as is demonstrated in our patient.",

Although the precise mechanism of pathogenicity remains unclear, it is suggested that intrathecal synthesis of GAD65 antibody leads to the degeneration of GABAergic neurons that consequently release cytoplasmic proteins into the CSF eliciting an immune response [18]. As GAD is expressed by GABAergic neurons and is an enzyme involved in the conversion of glutamate to GABA, the inhibition of GAD via an autoimmune process could result in excessive excitatory neurotransmission, ultimately resulting in lowering of the seizure threshold [18, 19].",

AED selection in GAD65 epilepsy is similar to generalized clinically acceptable principles, that is, to achieve seizure control and tolerability. The challenges of therapy for burst suppression require frequent patient monitoring in a critical care setting, continuous subjective interpretation of EEG, and the careful titration of IV anesthetics. Further monitoring must be done to avoid AEDs and IV anesthetics at dangerous levels or the development of adverse side effects. Furthermore, there are consequences to prolonged high-dose infusion for each of these IV anesthetic agents. For example, due to high-dose propofol infusions for multiple days, the patient was screened for propofol infusion syndrome by following creatinine protein kinase (CPK) levels and lactate levels. In addition, treatment with phenobarbital requires the monitoring of a basic metabolic panel (BMP) for hypokalemia and liver function tests (LFTs) for hepatic dysfunction. Of note, phenobarbital is a CYP P450 inducer and affects the serum levels of other AEDs, in this case phenytoin. It is important to monitor serum drug levels to ensure therapeutic levels of phenytoin are maintained while phenobarbital is being administered.",
