Physiologic variables included blood pressure, heart rate, CO2, and O2. CO2 and O2 were measured using a SenTec CO2 and O2 saturation sensor (SenTec AG, Therwil, Switzerland). Subjective symptoms measured include perceived exertion, perceived thermal comfort, perceived respirator comfort, and subjective symptoms related to wearing an N95. Perceived exertion was measured using the Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion Scale,8 consisting of a Likert scale ranging from 6 to 20 points, with 6 = no exertion at all to 20 = maximal exertion. Perceived comfort was measured using a modified Frank Scale of Perceived Thermal Comfort Scale,8 consisting of a Likert scale ranging from 0 to 10 points, with 0 = coldest you\u2019ve ever been to 10 = hottest you\u2019ve ever been. Perceived N95 comfort was measured using a modified Roberge Respirator Comfort Scale,8 consisting of a Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5 points, with 1 = most comfortable you\u2019ve ever felt wearing an N95 respirator to 5 = most uncomfortable you\u2019ve ever felt wearing an N95. Subjective symptoms related to wearing an N95 included nausea, headache, light headedness, visual difficulties, shortness of breath, palpitations, confusion, and difficulty communicating; these variables were assessed using the Roberge Subjective Symptoms During Work Scale,8 a Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5 points, with 1 = not noticeable to 5 = very noticeable. Study researchers collected the physiologic and subjective symptom data.",

Analyses were run comparing changes over time because of wearing only an N95 and comparing changes when wearing only an N95 to wearing an N95/mask combination.

Of the nurses who participated in the entire study, each used an average of 3 N95s for each 12-hour shift. Nurses wore the N95 alone or with a mask for 214 and 199 minutes on average, respectively, before the first removal for any reason (Table 1\n); this time difference was not significant. Daily average times wearing the N95 alone or with a surgical mask during each episode were 223.7 and 159.1, respectively (Table 1); this time difference was not significant. Each time a nurse removed his/her N95, the reason for removal was documented. In total, nurses removed their respirator 68 times during the study, either to eat or drink, because it was the end of his/her shift, or because the N95 was uncomfortable in some way. About half of the removals (55.9%, n = 38) were reported to be because the nurse wanted to eat or get a drink. About one-quarter of the removals (22.1%, n = 15) were because the shift ended, and the remaining one-quarter (22.1%, n = 15) were due to reported discomfort. Qualitative statements made by nurses as reasons for removal included comments such as, \u201cIt is getting hard to breathe,\u201d \u201c[the N95] is uncomfortable,\u201d and \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d",

However, although there were statistically significant negative physiologic changes over time associated with wearing respiratory protection (especially among those wearing an N95 with a mask overlay), these changes were not clinically relevant. For instance, the statistically significant rise in CO2 levels over time from baseline to the end of the shift did not result in CO2 levels that reached the clinical definition of hypercapnia (defined as an arterial CO2 level \u2265 45).

Other subjective symptoms also increased over time, including complaints of headache, lightheadedness, perceived exertion, and impeded communication. When wearing an N95 with mask overlay, nurses reported feeling more nausea and had more visual challenges than when they wore only an N95.

In this study, only 1 nurse had high intolerance to wearing an N95 (as evidence by withdrawing from the study because of discomfort after only half an hour). The reasons for the longer tolerance despite increasing complaints of discomfort seen in this study are not known. It is possible that the timing of the 2 studies played a role in the subjects\u2019 tolerance for wearing N95s. This study occurred after the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, an event that necessitated prolonged use of N95s for many health care personnel until the H1N1 vaccine was released, and one that involved a shortage of N95s among many health care agencies.3 Study participants\u2019 recent experiences during the 2009 pandemic may have provided increased motivation to tolerate long-term use of N95s.",

In addition, some MICU nurses who worked at the hospital from which subjects were recruited refused to participate because of an unwillingness to wear an N95 for 2 entire shifts. It is likely that volunteer subjects tolerate wearing N95s better than those who refused to even be screened for the study. This has implications for future disasters during which health care personnel may be required to wear N95s for long periods of time. More frequent work breaks may need to be incorporated into work shifts when long-term N95 use is required. Future studies should also examine other factors that may help increase health care personnel tolerance of long-term N95 usage.",

Nurses with higher BMIs were less compliant when wearing an N95, in terms of being more likely to touch their respirator, than those with lower BMIs. This more frequent touching of the respirator may have been related to perceived discomfort because nurses with higher BMIs reported many more subjective symptoms (such as more perceived shortness of breath, discomfort, thermal discomfort, and headaches) related to wearing respiratory protection than nurses with lower BMIs. These findings have not been identified in previous research on N95 tolerance8, 11 and have potential significant implications for future disaster response. In the US general population, 33% of people are overweight (but not obese), and another 36% are obese17; data specific to nurses could not be found, but there is no reason to believe that a lower rate of obesity among health care personnel would exist compared with the United States as a whole. With such a high rate of overweight and/or obese health care personnel, and an associated lower tolerance for long-term N95 usage among these individuals, it may be difficult to safely implement extended use or reuse policies for N95s without building in additional break times for staff. Additional studies are needed to further examine the relationship between weight and N95 tolerance and compliance.",

            "text": "The nurses in this study were fairly compliant with wearing respiratory protection, meaning that they wore it correctly and did not frequently engage in behaviors that might lead to potential auto-inoculation, even over long periods of time. Contrary to the authors\u2019 hypothesis, nurses did not become less compliant over the course of a shift and actually became more compliant the second day of wear than the first in terms of the number of times they adjusted their N95 or touched their face or the respirator. The reasons for this are unknown but may be because the nurses became accustomed to wearing the N95 over the course of the study. This finding is different from a previously published study that found that N95 compliance decreases over time.16 This may be because the Seale et al study16 occurred over 4 weeks versus only 2 shifts observed in this study or because this sample consisted of only intensive care nurses. Researchers have indicated that intensive care unit staff are often more compliant with N95s than health care personnel in other areas/units.15 One somewhat troubling finding from this study is that the most frequently performed noncompliant behaviors involved 2 practices that may put health care personnel at risk of exposure to infectious particles when wearing N95s: touching the N95 and/or adjusting it during use. Better or more frequent education of health care personnel may be needed to reduce these potentially harmful behaviors and protect workers from exposure because knowledge has been found to be associated with better adherence to proper respirator practice.15\n",

Sometimes the nurse participants reused an N95 (ie, redonned it after removal), and other times they chose to don a new N95. Each nurse used an average of 3 N95s per shift during the study, regardless of how often he/she chose to don and doff respiratory protection. This finding provides a general guideline for hospitals to use when estimating the number of N95s needed per staff member during a disaster if an extended-use/reuse policy is implemented by the agency and is different from previously published recommendations regarding how to estimate the number of N95s that may be needed during a disaster.2\n",

It is also the first study in a health care setting to compare the physiologic impact of wearing an N95 alone to the N95 with mask overlay combination recommended by the Institute of Medicine to be used during times of limited resources. This study also has a robust methodology because of the nature of the randomization of subjects and the repeated measures design. One potential limitation of this study is that volunteer subjects may tolerate N95s better than those who refused to be screened for the study, reducing the generalizability of the findings to all health care personnel. Another potential limitation is the use of transcutaneous measurement of CO2 versus the more accurate method of arterial measurement; however, transcutaneous CO2 measurement has been shown to have adequate accuracy,18, 19 and it has been used in all previous studies examining the physiologic impact of N95 use because of the avoidance of potential complications related to arterial punctures.1, 7 Last, because only intensive care unit nurses were recruited, the findings may not be generalizable to workers in other areas of the hospital or to non-nurse health care personnel.",
