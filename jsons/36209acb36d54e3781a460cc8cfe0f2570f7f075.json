In particular, areas of Jeju Island with extensive swine production have faced repeated epidemics since the re-emergence in 2014. The current study reports the complete genome sequences and molecular characterization of the representative PEDV strains responsible for the 2018 endemic outbreaks on Jeju Island. All isolates were determined to belong genetically to the highly pathogenic pandemic G2b group. Full-length genome sizes of four isolates differed from that of the G2b epidemic field strain due to insertion or deletion (DEL) mutations in the non-structural protein (nsp)-or spike (S) protein-coding regions. The 2018 Jeju isolates shared 96.7%-98.7% and 98.5%-99.4% identity at the S gene and whole-genome levels, respectively, compared to global G2b PEDV strains. Genetic and phylogenetic analyses indicated that the 2018 isolates were closest to the 2014 G2b re-emergent Jeju strains, but appeared to have undergone substantial rapid independent evolution.",

Genomic sequencing identified a unique 8-nt DEL in the extreme C-terminal region of the S gene at the 4th passage (KNU-1807-P4) compared to its original sample. This DEL resulted in the premature termination of S by nine amino acid residues (EVFEKVHVQ), which contained a KxHxx motif that is a potential endoplasmic reticulum retrieval signal. In vivo animal studies showed that variant strain KNU-1807 had decreased virulence in suckling piglets. These results advance our knowledge regarding the genetic variation and pathogenicity of the G2b PEDV endemic strains prevalent in Jeju swine herds in South Korea.",

The 2013 PED pandemic that ravaged the United States (Stevenson et al., 2013) also struck the Korean Peninsula and decimated more than 40% of the pig farms across the country during 2013-2014 (Lee, 2015 (Lee, , 2019 . Subsequently, in late March 2014, the virus invaded Jeju Island located 80 km from the South Korea mainland at the closest point, which had maintained PEDV-na\u00efve status for a decade, causing massive neonatal mortality in provincial herds. Genetic and phylogenetic analyses revealed that the re-emergent Jeju Island PEDV isolates were most closely related to the pandemic genogroup 2b (G2b) strains that were responsible for the 2013-2014 global outbreaks, suggesting a direct introduction of the virus from the mainland of South Korea via unknown contaminating sources . Even with province-wide vaccination or intentional virus-exposure practices being implemented in order to provide herd immunity around the areas that contain dense swine populations, PEDV has continued to plague the provincial pork industry. Since several pig farms have experienced recurrent PEDV outbreaks within a single year, PED has become endemic on Jeju Island . In this study, we determined the complete genome sequences of field isolates on Jeju Island to investigate the diversity of the PEDVs responsible for the ongoing endemic outbreaks. Additionally, we isolated and serially cultured a novel PEDV strain, KOR/KNU-1807/2018, in cell culture and investigated its genotypic and phenotypic characteristics in vitro and in vivo.",

However, since coronaviruses are known to innately exist as quasispecies or as mixed populations of several strains (Zhang et al., 2007) , we cannot exclude the possibility that this variant was initially present as a minor proportion in the clinical sample and was able to replicate more competently in cell culture instead of the emergence of the extraordinarily DEL during the earliest stages of cell adaption. Similarly, a Chinese field G2b strain, FL2013, that naturally contains a unique 21-nt DEL in the extreme C-terminus of its S protein, leading to a 7-aa (FEKVHVQ ) S C-DEL pattern, has been found to have reduced virulence to newborn piglets (Zhang et al., 2015) . Thus, it is important to further surveil whether S C-DEL variant strains naturally circulate in Korean pig populations.",

Our data revealed that despite similarities of macroscopic and microscopic small intestine lesions, the KNU-1807 virus possessed weakened pathogenicity in experimentally inoculated piglets compared to the virulent KNU-141112 strain in terms of disease severity of clinical presentation, including the mortality rate and onset of virus shedding, indicating the involvement of the extreme C-terminal region of the S protein in virulence. However, we were unable to observe a fully attenuated phenotypes for KNU-1807 in inoculated animals compared with those seen in our previous study .",

However, the loss of neonates to death varies among litters and between farms and is less than that reported for severe G2b epidemics, which approach 100% mortality in newborn piglets. This mild-to-moderate outbreak scenario seen on Jeju Island may be due to herd immunity developed from vaccination and intentional infection since the re-emergence of PEDV in the area. Another possibility is that genetic variation and/or DEL in nsps and S protein have arisen under field circumstances leading to the evasion of host immune defenses, such as IFN and neutralizing antibodies, and consequently alter viral pathogenicity, leading to endemic and low-pathogenic outbreaks in the field. Thus, cutting-edge research using reverse genetics will be necessary to provide fundamental insights into the specific role of nsp and S gene mutations in PEDV pathogenesis. More importantly, the current study confirmed that the contemporary field G2b isolates have nearly 4% amino acid sequence divergence in the S protein compared to the 2013-2014 domestic G2b strains. This mutation rate is approximately twice as high as that in recent mainland strains of PEDV (Lee & Lee, 2018) .",

Subsequently, we were able to determine the complete S gene sequences of the 2018 completely absent in the genome sequences of the other G1 and G2 strains available in the GenBank database. Compared to the prototype CV777 strain(Lee, 2015;Lee et al., 2010), all the Jeju isolates contained the genetic signature of the G2 field strains withS insertions-deletions (S INDELs) (Figure S1). Further sequencing analysis suggested small-scale genetic variations among the eleven 2018 strains with 96.8%-100% homology at the amino acid level among them. Moreover, the Jeju Island strains from 2018 also demonstrated 96.7%-98.7% aa identity with the global G2b PEDVs reported previously in Jeju Island, mainland South Korea, and the US, but only 91.3%-92.5% and 94.0%-94.7% aa homology with the classical G1a or variant G1b strains respectively (Table 1). Compared to the 2014 re-emergent Jeju strain KNU-1409, the 2018 Jeju viruses contained a total of 19-26 aa mutations in the S gene (Figure 1a). Remarkably, more than half of these variations were identified only in the 2018 Jeju Island strains (black lines). In particular, KNU-1806, -1807, -1815, -1816 and -1818 each possessed their own unique mutations that did not exist in other domestic strains (black arrow lines)compared. In total, the genetic data indicated that the 2018 Jeju isolates were still most closely related to the G2b pandemic strains but that they continued to independently evolve through the process of genetic drift.We then sequenced and analysed the complete genomes of seven representative strains to investigate the genetic relatedness between the contemporary Jeju-endemic strains and other global PEDV strains. Among those, whole genomes of only three strains consisted of 28,038 nt (excluding the 3\u2032 poly(A) tail), which was the genome size of most G2b field viruses. However, the genome of KNU-1816 was longer with 28,050 nt, while the genome sequences of KNU-1807, -1815, and -1818 were each shorter and 28,017, 28,029 and 28,035 nt respectively. The longer genome of KNU-1816 was ascribed to a 4-aa insertion in the S protein as described above, whereas the shorter genome sizes of KNU-1807 and -1815 resulted from unique 21-nt (7-aa) or 9-nt (3-aa) deletion (DEL) at genomic positions 3,324-3,344 or 3,408-3,416 located in ORF1a encoding nsp3, respectively(Figure 1b), which serves as a papain-like protease (PL pro ). Intriguingly, additional sequence analysis of isolates KNU-1820 and KNU-1821, which were found to be most closely genetically and geographically related to KNU-1815, revealed the acquisition of identical 3-aa DEL mutations in nsp3, suggesting direct transmission of the homologous strain among these farms(Figure 1aand b). The remaining strain KNU-1818 possessed a 3-nt (1-aa) DEL at genomic positions 10,575-10,577 in ORF1a encoding nsp6. Except for the S-insertion in KNU-1816, the nsp3-DEL in KNU-1807, -1815, -1820 and -1821, and the nsp6-DEL in KNU-1818, no additional INDELs were identified throughout the entire genome.",

These were further divided into subgroups 1a, 1b, 2a and 2b(Figure 2a).

In infected Vero cells from passage 4 (P4), KNU-1807 produced obvious CPE typical of PEDV infection, such as cell fusion, syncytium formation and cell detachment. Increased syncytia size became more distinct at the 5th passage (P5). Virus propagation was confirmed by the detection of PEDV antigens with IFA using a PEDV N-specific MAb. The apparent staining was localized in the cytoplasm of syncytial cells. In contrast, neither CPE nor N-specific staining was evident in mock-inoculated Vero cells.

The S sequence analysis of the P4 isolate of KNU-1807 (KNU-1807-P4) compared to the original KNU-1807-SI sample revealed that KNU-1807-P4 acquired 3-nt substitutions that resulted in two non-synonymous changes (Phe to Leu and Lys to Arg) at aa positions 501 and 614 respectively. Strikingly, a continuous 8-nt DEL was identified in the C-terminal region of the S gene of KNU-1807-P4 at genomic positions 24,742-24,749, leading to a frameshift that caused an alternative TGA termination codon upstream of the authentic termination of S (Figure 4a). As a result of the early termination, a 9-aa truncated cytoplasmic domain (S C-DEL9) and one aa mutation (Y1377F) at the last position of the S gene product were generated compared to that of KNU-1807-SI (Figure 4b",

In contrast, all KNU-141112-P5-challenged piglets (group 1) exhibited clinical signs, including lethargy, anorexia, and diarrhoeic faeces by 24 hpi (mean CSS = 1.66) and experienced severe watery diarrhoea with vomiting thereafter (mean CSS > 3.0) (Figure 5a). PEDV-associated mortality occurred in two of the animals in group 1 at 88 hpi. Although the onset of clinical sings was 1-day delayed in the S C-DEL 9 virus-inoculated animals in group 2, they eventually developed PEDV-specific clinical symptoms from 32 or 40 hpi (mean CSS = 3). Only one animal in group 2 died from PEDV at 88 hpi, whereas the three remaining piglets experienced less severe watery diarrhoea from 96 dpi onward and remained alive until the termination of the study(Figure 5a).

Their small intestines were distended with the accumulation of a yellowish watery content and presented with thin transparent intestinal walls as a result of villous atrophy (Figure 6a). Microscopic assessment showed that the small intestines from all piglets in group 1 were characterized by acute viral enteritis with a shortening and fusion of the small intestine villi and vacuolation of the superficial epithelial cells (Figure 6g). IHC staining detected PEDV antigen predominant in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells in atrophied villi in all segments of the small intestines (Figure 6m). Analogously, both dead and surviving animals infected with KNU-1807 in group 2 during the experimental period exhibited remarkable visible pathological intestinal lesions (Figure 6b-e), typical histopathological features of viral enteritis with villous atrophy (Figure 6h-k) and the presence of viral antigen (Figure 6n-q),comparable to those in group 1.
