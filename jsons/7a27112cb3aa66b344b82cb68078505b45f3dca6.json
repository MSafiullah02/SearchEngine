Therefore, in order to reduce the risk of a severe disease course in individuals with COVID-19, it is critically important to improve the treatment of all concomitant diseases, for both healthy people and those already infected. Moreover, physicians need to know whether a patient's baseline therapy regimen should be continued concomitantly with antiviral, antiretroviral, antiparasitic, antirheumatic, and antibiotics (mainly macrolides) that may be administered to individuals with symptoms of COVID-19 [4] . An equally important challenge is to provide J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f accessible healthcare to those patients with concomitant diseases, including ambulatory and inpatient care, and continued access to laboratory measurements, imaging tests, and medicines.",

            "text": "FH patients are a group with important healthcare needs who require frequent and continued medical attention. It is estimated that more than 30 million individuals worldwide have FH, and this large number of patients is of special importance at the time of a global pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 [5] . Both heFH and hoFH patients (especially the latter) have a genetic predisposition to very high circulating concentrations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Recent recommendations suggest that all FH patients should be considered to have (at least) a high CVD risk [6] . If they have any additional risk factors, FH patients are at very high risk. The most recent recommendations suggest that FH patients should be considered to have an extremely high risk of repeated events if they have had an occurrence of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) [7] . Consequently, all these patient groups should be treated in order to achieve a circulating concentration of LDL-C below 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L), and those at very high risk below 55 mg/dL (1.4 mmol/L), according to the principle of 'the lower, the better'. This is critically important in order to stabilize and potentially even reduce the burden of atherosclerotic plaque, and consequently to lower CVD events' risk as well as mortality [8, 9] . Lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) with statins, fixed combinations of statins with ezetimibe, and/or triple therapy with proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors results in stabilization of plaques and prevention of CVD events [8, 9] . However, these drugs have additional mechanisms of action. Statins may substantially reduce inflammation and oxidative stress beyond that attributable to LDL-C reduction (and the reduction of oxidized LDL-C), through pleiotropic (anti-inflammatory) effects. PCSK9 inhibitors potentially reduce inflammation as a result of (among other effects) downregulation of LDL receptors, reduction of proinflammatory mediators, reduced infiltration of monocytes into the subendothelial layer and monocyte migration, and amelioration of vascular J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f inflammation [10] [11] [12] . These mechanisms are critically important in the context of COVID-19, because available data suggests that the disease results in a cytokine storm in susceptible patients, which would be expected to promote instability of the atherosclerotic plaque and consequent myocardial infarction with a very poor prognosis [13] . Therefore, because FH patients are at high, or extremely high risk of CVD, they need to be treated optimally and it is vital for them to have access to drugs and procedures (such as lipid apheresis in the case of severe HeFH and HoFH). Physicians need to know how to optimally manage FH patients who become infected with coronavirus, and to be aware of any interactions between drugs used to treat COVID-19, and drugs used in the management of FH.",

Healthcare systems should be organized in such a way to allow the effective therapy of patients with COVID-19 (including those with FH), but also to allow the optimal treatment of uninfected FH patients, especially those with life-threatening CV complications, to avoid an increase in morbidity and mortality unrelated to COVID-19. Meeting these two objectives simultaneously is difficult because of the large number of SARS-CoV-2 cases being admitted to hospital and also changes the out-patients' routine practices.",

Lomitapide may effectively prevent CVD events when lipid apheresis is unavailable [14] . Reimbursement for PCSK9 inhibitors could be extended for those at very high and extremely high-risk patients of CVD events, who do not meet the current criteria in given countries. Access to these drugs for new J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f and already treated patients could be improved by allowing GPs to prescribe them. In this way, it would be possible to have most FH patients on optimal LLT, resulting in fewer CVD events, and better prognosis should these patients become infected with SARS-CoV-2. [13, 15] . Finally, it is essential that educational activities for patients at the highest risk of CVD (including those with FH) are continued. These include joint activities of governmental organizations, scientific societies and patient organizations, which provide regular and extensive information on drug accessibility. It is also essential to maintain the availability of necessary procedures for FH patients in specialized centers (e.g. drug programs, lipid apheresis). ",

However, in one study with infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV-CoV), it was demonstrated that cholesterol reduction disrupted lipid rafts and prevented binding of coronavirus with the host cells. In another study with porcine deltacoronavirus (PD-CoV), the authors observed that cholesterol present in the cell membrane and viral envelope contributed to virus replication by acting as a key component in viral entry. Therefore, the pharmacological reduction of cellular or viral cholesterol with effective LLT might block both virus attachment and internalization [16, 17] . There is also data suggesting that statins might enhance angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which could mitigate the invasion of SARS-CoV-2 through the ACE2 receptor, potentially having a beneficial effect in attenuating risk of infection [18] ; another data, based on in-silico study, showed that pitavastatin, rosuvastatin, lovastatin, and fluvastatin could be efficient SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitors [19] .",
