            "text": "In December 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia with unknown etiology began to arise in the city of Wuhan, China and the diagnosis of influenza and other Coronaviruses (such as MERS and SARS) were considered but later excluded by laboratory tests 1,2 . On 7 th of January, 2020, China announced that the cause of that epidemic was a new Coronavirus strain, later designated SARS-CoV-2 and proven to be present in wild bats 2, 3, 4 . The transmission mode of SARS-nCoV-2 is through respiratory droplets, and they are either a source of direct or indirect contamination 5, 6 . This strain presented a basic reproduction number (R0) within a range from 1.4 to 6.5: the highest infection rates in the elderly or in people with underlying pathologies 2, 7 . Therefore, this means that this strain of virus has a high rate of human-to-human transmission and a person is much more contagious as more symptomatic 6, 8 . The median age of the symptomatic patients seems to be between 47-59 years even though it can affect individuals of all ages 2 . The clinical presentation of COVID-19 has a wide spectrum that ranges from assymptomatic or slightly upper respiratory infection to septic shock 6, 9, 10 . The cardinal symptoms described by the World Health Organization and later integrated in the flowcharts issued by the Dire\u00e7\u00e3o Geral de Sa\u00fade (DGS) are \"cough\", \"fever\" and \"dyspnea\". However, other studies report myalgia, fatigue, headache and gastrointestinal symptoms as other symptoms to be taken into account 11, 12, 14 . In a study involving 1099 laboratory confirmed cases, Zhong et al described that the most common clinical manifestations were fever (88.7%), cough (67.8%) and fatigue (38.1%), with sputum, dyspnea, sore throat and headache also being highly reported by the patients 13 . This study also mentions that there was a minor percentage of patients who showed gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea. Despite the broad spectrum of the disease, Huang et al described that the elderly or those with underlying pathologies such as hypertension, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Diabetes Mellitus and cardiovascular diseases had a faster progression of the disease, with a higher rate of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, consequent multiorgan failure and higher rate of death 2, 10 . These pathologies, considered as risk factors for COVID-19, were later included in the \"Norma de Orienta\u00e7\u00e3o Cl\u00ednica 004/2020\" of DGS, as patients with a particular risk of infection and with higher care needs. At the moment, there is no effective and approved antiretroviral treatment or vaccine targeting SARS-CoV-2, with the treatment being mainly symptomatic and organ support 6, 10 . Therefore, in the absence of effective specific treatment, there is a range of preventive measures to be taken, such as a correct handwashing, respiratory etiquette, disinfection of surfaces and social isolation and/or social distancing (> 2 meters) 2,3,6,14 . These measures are assumed as vital in the control of the mitigation of the pandemic 3, 14 .",

This empowerment through health literacy programs and official campaigns using television, radio and other media has a positive impact, especially in this actual context -outbreaks and/or pandemics 15-17 . On the 18 th of March, 2020, the State of Emergency was decreed in Portugal, with a Law Decree regulating preventive measures to contain the pandemic mitigation in Portugal. On the 26 th of March, 2020, phase 3.2 of the mitigation of COVID-19's pandemic in Portugal was declared, e.g., chains of community transmission of the virus in the national territory. Thereupon, it arose the need for tighter control and application of preventive measures. Regarding the positive impact of official campaigns and community empowerment with a strong health literacy, we considered it extremely important to study the health literacy of the population in this mitigation phase, in order to understand the flaws that may still exist as well as identifying possible predictors of health literacy concerning this matter. Thus, and since as far as we're concerned this is the first study focusing on this subject, it will be possible to rectify possible wrong ideas through specific intervention strategies aimed at different populations. Also, we hope that this study helps to identify possible errors/flaws of health literacy in a pandemic situation and to avoid them at the early beginning of a possible future pandemic.",

According to Portuguese lexicon, \"cure\" is defined as \"act or effect of self-healing or healing somebody\" or \"health recovery\" and \"healing\" being described as \"restore health\". However, the answers given along the phone calls highlighted the uncertainty in this definition, emphasizing the insecurity in answering this question. Indeed, throughout this study, most of the people who answered \"No\", justified using sentences such as \"there's no vaccine\" or \"there's not a medication targeting the virus\". These findings underline some incongruences and misconceptions. A vaccine is a tertiary preventive measure administered in an individual to confer immunity to a certain infectious disease, which enables an asymptomatic/mild clinical manifestation of it, useful in controlling epidemics [29] [30] [31] . Therefore, it is necessary to demystify the idea that a vaccine is a cure for an infectious disease. Even though there's not a specific antiretroviral targeting SARS-CoV-2 efficiently approved, there are several reported cases of healed patients, matching with the Portuguese definition of \"cure\" 6, 10, 28, 32 . Interestingly, the Undergraduate Group presents a higher relative frequency of the answer \"Yes\", yet, it wasn't possible to find any information in literature supporting this finding.",

In the literature there are several studies that report the importance of handwashing, respiratory etiquette and social isolation in containing epidemics and in controlling SARS-CoV-2 transmission 28,33 . Indeed, even though Chao Yang reports that there's no proven efficacy of handwashing in controlling SARS-CoV-2 transmission 34 , there are several findings that report the opposite. Qing-Xia et al , in a study involving 7 countries, alert to the fact that handwashing significantly slows the exponential spread of SARS-CoV-2 35 and several other studies showed that a correct handwashing is useful in controlling epidemics as well as SARS transmission 21, 35, 36 . Even though handwashing is an important preventive measure to adopt face to COVID-19, unfortunately, there are findings that show that the correct procedure -as recommended by WHO -isn't always applied and that some mistakes are observed, as such low frequency in washing hands and not washing hands the enough time 37, 38 . Also, Zhang et al conducted a study in Beijing's population as a post-pandemic assessment and verified that even though people knew the importance of handwashing, they did not apply it 14 . In their study, Fung et al also observed a decline of practice of this preventive measure 14 . Therefore, in order to avoid this decline and errors, we must implement methods to successfully achieve a correct preventive handwashing 39 .",

This fact may be explained by the fact that Non-Risk Group is a younger group. Thus, younger people belong to the proletariat more than older people, having the necessity to leave home for work, which can be a justification to this finding. Regarding the answers obtained in question 7, there are still cases of people who believe it is possible to receive or visit family and/or friends at home.

Regarding the global use of gloves, its general use is not recommended by WHO, CDC and DGS and may even constitute a false security if people don't discard them regarding the proper procedure 47 . The use of masks has been under constant study since the beginning of this pandemic, in order to understand whether it prevents the infection by SARS-CoV-2 or not and the literature regarding this matter is very controversial. However, in a recent study, Greenhalgh et al advocate the general use of the mask, regardless of their material, even stating that a simple cotton mask will reduce the amount of transmitted virus by 36 times 48 . Indeed, masks are gaining a major role as a community preventive measure and not as an individual preventive measure 35,44,48,49,50. Concluding, even though we observe a relatively well informed population, this is a pandemic of a virus with an elevated Transmission Rate.

Likewise, a new index variable representing health literacy could have been created, in order to state the level of health literacy of an individual. In further studies, this new variable can be created based on WHO and DGS information, enabling a comparative study of various coefficients, considering criteria and quality adjustment metrics.",
