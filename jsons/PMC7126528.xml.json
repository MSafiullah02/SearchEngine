These viruses can cause liver disease that can result in cirrhosis of the liver and hepatocellular carcinoma.17 Several types of hepatitis viruses, A to E, have been identified.17 Hepatitis B and C can be readily transmitted by blood transfusion, and hepatitis A and E are rarely transmitted by transfusion. Although several hepatitis viruses have been identified, there is still a modest proportion of hepatitis that cannot be attributed to these known viruses. Hepatitis G virus and the TT virus (TTV) were candidates for non\u2013A to E hepatitis, but extensive study failed to demonstrate that these agents were causative of posttransfusion hepatitis or any other disease. SEN viruses, a variant of TTV, may cause some posttransfusion hepatitis.18 SEN viruses have been shown to be prevalent in the donor pool, but a clear correlation between these viruses and hepatitis has not been shown. Transmission of viral hepatitis, particularly HBV and HCV, from blood donors to recipients through the transfusion of blood components and plasma derivatives has been well documented.19 The transfusion transmission of HBV and HCV has been dramatically reduced because of testing, but this has highlighted the residual risk of transfusion-transmitted hepatitis and the possible emergence of undiscovered hepatitis viruses.19\n",

Because studies demonstrate increasing numbers of seroprevalent donors and because Chagas disease is difficult to recognize, the reported incidence is thought to be an underestimate. A multiyear epidemiological study of T cruzi in Los Angeles blood donors demonstrated that seroprevalence rates in high-risk populations (comprised of people who were born in or who had spent a significant amount of time in a T cruzi\u2013endemic country) increased significantly from 1996 to 1998.67 It has been estimated that 1 in 25 000 US blood donors are positive for T cruzi antibodies, and studies suggest that 63% of blood donors with antibodies to T cruzi have evidence of active parasitemia in their peripheral blood.67., 68.\n",

Four species of Plasmodium, Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium malariae, and Plasmodium ovale, are known to cause human malaria.

In endemic areas, malaria is the main indication for transfusion and is a significant cause of morbidity in young children. Human malaria is found primarily in tropical and subtropical regions; however, approximately 1 to 2 cases of transfusion-acquired malaria are reported in the United States annually.69 Transfusion transmission is primarily via RBCs, but platelets have also been implicated, probably because of the presence of RBCs in platelet concentrates. The immigration of infected individuals who spread the parasite when bitten by local mosquitoes and a phenomenon called \u201cairport malaria,\u201d in which infected mosquitoes ride with airplanes and cause infections near airports, have contributed to the emergence of Plasmodium as a threat to the blood supply.70., 71., 72.\n",

Despite hemostatic efficacy, patients in the PCT group had lower platelet count increments and shorter transfusion intervals and required more platelet transfusions than the reference group.

Frangible anchor-linked effectors are activated by a pH shift when added to packed red cells suspended in residual plasma and a red cell additive solution at neutral pH. Clinical trial results with S-303 in healthy volunteers and patients demonstrated that transfusions of S-303\u2013treated RBCs were well tolerated and showed comparable recovery and survival to control RBC.98., 99.

Traditional cost-effectiveness analysis generally uses a quality-adjusted life-year threshold of US$100 000 to discriminate cost-effective from cost-ineffective interventions.128 However, blood safety interventions, such as NAT, with higher quality-adjusted life-year thresholds have been adopted.
