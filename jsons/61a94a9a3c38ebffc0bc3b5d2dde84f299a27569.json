Effective interventions and treatments at the earliest possible times are warranted to suppress the fatality of the disease to a minimum, and inappropriate treatments should be abolished. In this situation, the ability to extract most information out of the data available is critical so that important decisions can be made. Ineffectiveness of the treatment can be reflected by a constant fatality over time while effective treatment normally leads to a decreasing fatality rate. A statistical test for constant fatality over time is proposed in this article. The proposed statistic is shown to converge to a Brownian motion asymptotically under the null hypothesis. With the special features of the Brownian motion, we are able to analyze the first passage time distribution based on a sequential tests approach. This allows the null hypothesis of constant fatality rate to be rejected at the earliest possible time when adequate statistical evidence accumulates. Simulation studies show that the performance of the proposed test is good and it is extremely sensitive in picking up decreasing fatality rate. The proposed test is applied to the severe acute respiratory syndrome data in Hong Kong and Beijing.",

Traditionally, the fatality rate is assumed to be constant throughout the epidemic, and is generally estimated as the ratio of the cumulative number of deaths to the cumulative number of cases. It is well known that this estimator is insensitive to changes in fatality over the course of the epidemic (Last, 1995) . Studies have shown that this traditional estimator has underestimated the fatality of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) considerably especially in the early part of the epidemic . The consequence of this underestimation could be very serious because the implementation of suitable preventive measures at the early stage of an outbreak may heavily depend on the estimated fatality rate. Moreover, the fatality rate of a newly emerging epidemic may vary over time possibly due to improvement in clinical treatments and hospital management. Sometimes, changes in weather or environmental conditions over the course of the epidemic may also have an effect on the fatality. It is important to keep track of the fatality rate over the course of the epidemic so that the effectiveness of any implemented health policy or clinical treatment can be assessed and evaluated. The estimator for the time-varying fatality rate via a counting process and kernel function was proposed in . An estimator derived from the chain multinomial model was considered by .",

Due to the urgency in an outbreak of an epidemic, effective interventions and treatments at the earliest possible time are warranted to suppress the fatality of the disease to a minimum. Hence, a desirable property of the test is the ability to reject the null hypothesis as soon as we have enough evidence of a decreasing fatality as information accumulates over time. This property is particularly important in practice when combating a newly emerging disease. For example, the etiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, clinical management, or prognosis for the SARS epidemic were almost unknown to clinicians. Therefore, appropriate and effective interventions should be undertaken at the earliest possible time during the outbreak or else any delayed effort will result in less impact in controlling the epidemic. In this situation, the ability to extract the most information out of the data available is critical for making a focused and effective decision. Therefore, it is desirable if we can reject the null hypothesis of constant fatality rate at the earliest possible time during the outbreak of the epidemic.",

In the SARS epidemic in 2003, it was suggested by the World Health Organization (WHO) that simple methods for calculating case-fatality ratios from aggregate data will not give reliable estimates during the course of an epidemic (WHO, 2003) . This statement is not entirely true. In the case of a constant fatality rate, a simple estimator based on the ratio of the cumulative number of deaths to the sum of the cumulative numbers of deaths and recoveries is shown to be its maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). This estimator is demonstrated to be more efficient in Section 3 and is more preferred if the assumption of constant fatality is valid. If the fatality rate is known to vary over time, a real-time fatality rate estimator should be used , which was shown to be able to capture the changes and to monitor the fatality rate in a timely manner.",

Inpatients are assumed to either die at a rate of \u03b3 1 (t) or recover at a rate of \u03b3 2 (t) on day t, where t is the calendar time since the beginning of the epidemic rather than the time since individual onset as in traditional survival analysis.

In such situations, we propose to randomly impute the death and discharge (recovery) times within the day, or simply impute the order of deaths and discharges on that day because the test statistic only requires the order of occurrences of the events rather than the exact time to occurrences of the events. Also, we assume that all inpatients enter the system at the beginning of each day.

The estimates and their associated 95% pointwise confidence limits were plotted in the left and right panels of Figure 2 , respectively. The above conclusion that the null hypothesis of constant fatality rate is not rejected for the Hong Kong data is further supported by the plot in the left panel of Figure 2 . The estimate based on\u03c0(t) has been very stable since April 22, while the estimated time-varying fatality rate\u03c0(t) simply fluctuates around\u03c0(t) over t. The two sets of estimates agree closely with each other in general. The 95% pointwise confidence intervals based on\u03c0(t) are much narrower than those based on the time-varying fatality estimates,\u03c0(t). Hence the simple estimator\u03c0(t) should be more efficient if the constant fatality assumption is valid. The plot in the right panel of Figure 2 shows that the constant fatality is highly unlikely to be the case for Beijing data. The patterns of the two estimates differ considerably. The estimate based on\u03c0(t) does not appear to be constant itself, but exhibits a decreasing trend over time. However, it has a similar pattern as\u03c0(t) but the value of\u03c0(t) is consistently about 10-13% greater than that of\u03c0(t). It is mainly due to the inertia of the MLE which is strongly influenced by the higher number of deaths in the early part of the epidemic. In Beijing, there were more confirmed cases after May 1, but with fewer deaths afterward. The proposed test statistic for constant fatality seems to work well in these applications. A large scale simulation study is reported to investigate the performance of the proposed test empirically in the next section.",

When an effective new treatment or an intervention policy is implemented, it should cause a marked drop in the fatality rate. By formulating a model with time-varying fatality rate, the proposed test is a useful tool to justify or to evaluate the effectiveness of the adopted health policies and/or the clinical management. A main advantage of this test is that as information accumulates over time, we are able to reject the null hypothesis as soon as there is enough evidence of decreasing fatality over time. Hence, more effective intervention measures can be launched in place to reduce fatality. Applications of V n (\u03c4 ) to the Hong Kong (with \u03c4 = 110) and Beijing data (with \u03c4 = 72) lead to essentially the same conclusions with asymptotic p-values 0.3082 and < 0.0001, respectively. The performance of the test statistic V n (\u03c4 ) is also studied in a simulation study not reported here. The performance is very similar to the one proposed, but the shortcoming of the test V n (\u03c4 ) is that it is evaluated at a prespecified time \u03c4 , but we are not able to reject H 0 before time \u03c4 even though there exhibits strong statistical evidence. However, this could also be the merit in some other applications. Modification of the proposed sequential tests can be made easily by using different times of interim analysis, say by making a comparison every three days instead of every day. This version has the advantage that the environmental and weather conditions will be more homogeneous within each period under consideration so that some uncontrollable variation can be grouped together or marginalized as the fatality rate may also be affected by the temperature or humidity. More work needs to be done to explore the feasibility of the modified test in practice.",

If the strain acquires human-to-human transmissibility, its virulence to humans may or may not be the same as the historical level when transmission is limited to avian-to-human only. In the case of an outbreak due to human-to-human transmission, the proposed test will then be an extremely useful tool to provide a formal statistical method to test the hypothesis of decreasing fatality presumably due to some effective interventions in a sense that the alternative hypothesis can be accepted as soon as there is enough statistical evidence so that prompt and decisive action can be taken more effectively to suppress the fatality at the earliest time. A delay in the implementation of some effective intervention may result in more life loss globally. Nevertheless, we hope this test will never be used in practice.",

By the invariant property of the MLE, we have\u03c0 =\u03b8/(1 +\u03b8) = N 1 (\u03c4 )/(N 1 (\u03c4 ) + N 2 (\u03c4 )) which completes the proof.",
