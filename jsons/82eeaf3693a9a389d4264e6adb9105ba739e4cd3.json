            "text": "Effective detection of fake news has recently attracted significant attention. Current studies have made significant contributions to predicting fake news with less focus on exploiting the relationship (similarity) between the textual and visual information in news articles. Attaching importance to such similarity helps identify fake news stories that, for example, attempt to use irrelevant images to attract readers' attention. In this work, we propose a Similarity-Aware FakE news detection method (SAFE) which investigates multi-modal (textual and visual) information of news articles. First, neural networks are adopted to separately extract textual and visual features for news representation. We further investigate the relationship between the extracted features across modalities. Such representations of news textual and visual information along with their relationship are jointly learned and used to predict fake news. The proposed method facilitates recognizing the falsity of news articles based on their text, images, or their \"mismatches.\" We conduct extensive experiments on large-scale real-world data, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

            "text": "Following the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the impact of \"fake news\" has become a major concern. Based on a broad investigation of \u223c126,000 verified true and fake news stories on Twitter from 2006 to 2017, Vosoughi and colleagues revealed that fake news stories spread more frequently and faster compared to true news stories [20] . As indicated by the fundamental theories on fake news in psychology and social sciences (see a comprehensive survey in Ref. [27] ), the more a fake news article spreads, the higher the possibility of social media users spreading and trusting it due to repeated exposure and/or peer pressure. Such levels of trust and beliefs can easily be amplified and reinforced within social media due to its echo chamber effect [3] . Hence, extensive research has been conducted on effective detection of fake news to block its dissemination on social media. Fake news detection methods can be generally grouped into (1) contentbased and (2) social-context-based methods. The main difference between the two types of methods is whether or not they rely on social context information: the information on how the news has propagated on social media, where abundant auxiliary information of social media users involved and their connections/networks can be utilized. Many innovative and significant solutions (e.g., [1, 13, 15] ) have been proposed to exploit social context information. With more social context information available, one can often better detect fake news; however, detection becomes more challenging depending on the stage the news is currently at. It is difficult to detect fake news using social-context-based methods when it has been just published and has not been propagated (i.e., no social context information), which motivates us to further explore the role that news content can play in fake news detection.",

            "text": "As \"a news article that is intentionally and verifiably false\" [25] , fake news content often contains textual and visual information. Existing content-based fake news detection methods either solely consider textual information [26] , or combine both types of data ignoring the relationship (similarity) between them [4, 5, 23, 24] . The values in understanding such relationship (similarity) for predicting fake news are two-fold. To attract public attention, some fake news stories (or news stories with low-credibility) prefer to use dramatic, humorous (facetious), and tempting images whose content is far from the actual content within the news text. Furthermore, when a fake news article tells a story with fictional scenarios or statements, it is difficult to find both pertinent and nonmanipulated images to match these fictions; hence a \"gap\" exists between the textual and visual information of fake news when creators use non-manipulated images to support non-factual scenarios or statements. 1 With such considerations, we propose a Similarity-Aware FakE news detection method (SAFE). The method consists of three modules, performing (1) multi-modal (textual and visual) feature extraction; (2) within-modal (or say, modal-independent) fake news prediction; (3) cross-modal similarity extraction, respectively. For each news article, we first adopt neural networks to automatically obtain the latent representation of both its textual and visual information, based on which a similarity measure is defined between them. Then, such representations of news textual and visual information with their similarity are jointly learned and used to predict fake news. The proposed method aims to recognize the falsity of a news article on either its text or images, or the \"mismatch\" between the text and images.",

Within a traditional statistical natural language processing framework, such investigation has crossed multiple levels of language. By assuming that fake news differs from true news in linguistic/writing styles in the content, various hand-crafted features have been extracted from news content for representation and used for classification by, e.g., SVM and random forest. For example, P\u00e9rez-Rosas et al. employed lexical features by using bag-of-words with n-gram models, semantic features relying on LIWC [10] , syntactic features such as context-free grammars, and news readability [11] . Instead of extracting features based on experience, Zhou et al. [26] validated the role of fundamental theories in psychology and social science in guiding fake news feature engineering. Rhetorical structures among sentences or phrases within news content have also been investigated with either a vector space model [14] or Bi-LSTM [6] . Researchers have also explored the political bias [12] and homogeneity [2] of news publishers by mining news content that they have published, and have demonstrated how such information can help detect fake news.",

While current techniques have facilitated the development of multi-modal fake news detection, the relationship across modalities has been barely explored and exploited.

Nevertheless, verifying a news article that has been published online, e.g., on a news outlet such as BuzzFeed (https://www. buzzfeed.com/), before it has been disseminated on social media demands contentbased methods as social-context information at this stage does not exist.

GossipCop (https://www.gossipcop. com/) is a website that fact-checks celebrity reports and entertainment stories published in magazines and newspapers. News articles in PolitiFact dataset were published from May 2002 to July 2018 and those in GossipCop dataset were published from July 2000 to December 2018. Ground truth labels (fake or true) of news articles in both datasets were provided by domain experts, which guarantees the quality of news labels. Statistics of the two datasets are provided in Table 1 .",

(9), \u03b1 and \u03b2 are used to allocate the relative importance between the extracted multi-modal features (\u03b1) and the similarity across modalities (\u03b2). To assess their influence in method performance, we Case Study. In our case studies, we aim to answer the following questions: is there any real-world fake news story whose textual and visual information are not closely related to each other? If there is, can SAFE correctly recognize such irrelevance and further recognize its falsity? For this purpose, we went through the news articles in the two datasets, and compared their ground truth labels with their similarity scores computed by SAFE. Several examples are presented in Figs. 5-6. It can be observed that (I) the gap between textual and visual information exist for some fictitious stories for (but not limited to) two reasons. First, such stories are difficult to be supported by non-manipulated images. An example is in Fig. 5a , where no voting-and bill-related image is actually available. Compared to the couples having a real intimate relationship (see Fig. 5c ), the fake ones often have rare group photos or use collages (see Fig. 5c ). Second, using \"attractive\" though not closely relevant images can help increase the news traffic. For example, the fake news in Fig. 5b includes an image with a smiling individual that conflicts with the death story. (II) SAFE helps correctly assess the relationship (similarity) between news textual and visual information. For fake news stories in Fig. 5 , their corresponding similarity scores are all low and SAFE correctly labels them as fake news. Similarly, SAFE assigns all true news stories in Fig. 6 a high similarity score, and predicts them as true news.",

Results in Fig. 4 show that various parameter values lead to the accuracy (or F 1 score) of SAFE ranging from 0.75 to 0.85 (or from 0.8 to 0.9) for both datasets. The proposed method performs best when \u03b1 : \u03b2 = 0.4 : 0.6 in PolitiFact and \u03b1 : \u03b2 = 0.6 : 0.4 in GossipCop, which again validates the importance of both multi-modal information and cross-modal relationship in predicting fake news.",
