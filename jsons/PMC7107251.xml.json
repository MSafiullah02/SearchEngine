            "text": "Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a zoonotic mosquito-borne virus belonging to the genus Phlebovirus in the Family Bunyaviridae. It causes severe diseases in humans and livestock throughout Africa1 and the Arabian Peninsula2. RVFV is also considered to be a potential bioterrorism agent. In the last few decades, Rift Valley fever (RVF) outbreaks have been reported in eastern and southern Africa (e.g. Kenya, Somalia, United Republic of Tanzania, Madagascar and South Africa).3\u20137 In contrast, there have been very few reports on the recent occurrence of RVF in western and central Africa. Significant high- and low-prevalence clusters of RVF in sub-national areas on the African continent have been reported.8 Since the spread of RVFV largely depends on the mosquito vectors and the translocation of animal hosts, an endemic situation usually occurs in the restricted geographical areas inhabited by their hosts and vectors. In Nigeria, RVFV antibodies have been found in sheep, goats, cattle, horses and camels in the northern states of Kaduna and Sokoto9 and in the plateau area10 suggesting that the virus may be enzootic in Nigeria. In addition, serological studies conducted on human sera have confirmed the existence of the disease in Nigeria.11 The specific geographical location of Borno State in northeastern Nigeria, which shares international borders with three other African countries (Cameroun, Chad and Niger), makes it vulnerable to the transboundary spread of various diseases, including viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs). In addition, Borno State has been reported as the niche for Lassa fever virus (LASV) and possibly other VHFs. However, the epidemiology of RVF and other VHFs has not been extensively investigated in Borno State. A detailed and accurate investigation of the seroprevalence is necessary to ascertain the occurrence and spread of RVF in this area.",

Each well of the plates was then covered with 200 \u00b5l of PBS containing 5% skim milk and 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) (PBST-M), followed by incubation for 1 h at 37\u00b0C for blocking.

After a 1 h incubation period, the plates were washed three times with PBST and then were inoculated with goat anti-human IgG antibody labeled with HRP (1:1000 dilution; Zymed Laboratories, Inc., South San Francisco, CA, USA). After a further 1 h incubation period, the plates were washed and 100 \u00b5l of ABTS solution (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) was added to each well.

The mean plus three standard deviations (mean+3SD) of the ELISA indices for the IgG-ELISAs was calculated using human serum samples that were confirmed to be negative for infection with the respective viruses by IFA (data not shown) and was used as the cut-off value for the IgG-ELISAs. In order to minimize false-positive results that could occur with single serum dilution, IgG response was considered to be positive if the sample showed adjusted OD405 values above the cut-off at both 1:400 and 1:1600 dilutions.",

Single serum dilution (1:50) assay rather than titration by endpoint dilutions was performed in order to establish a high-throughput screening of NAbs. Since the infectivity of the RVFVpv, harboring the luciferase gene, could be ascertained by determining its luciferase activity, the neutralization activities of the sera were represented as the percent neutralization calculated from the reduction in the luciferase expression. Of the 278 serum samples tested, 43 (15.5%) showed more than 75% luciferase activity neutralization, and the remaining 235 (84.5%) showed less than 75% neutralization, compared with the non-serum control (Table 1). The sensitivity of the RVFVpv-based neutralization assay was determined by comparing the results with those obtained from the conventional neutralization assay using RVFV-MP12. All 34 serum samples that tested positive in the neutralization assay with RVFV-MP12 showed more than 50% neutralization of RVFVpv (Table 2). Furthermore, of the 211 serum samples that had less than 50% neutralization, none (0%) were positive for the neutralization assay with RVFV-MP12 (Table 2).\n",
