Several factors leading to the progression of COVID-19 pneumonia have been identified [5] . In addition to age, smoking status, maximum body temperature, respiratory failure, C-reactive protein, and serum albumin have been shown to be independent prognostic markers [5] . Although albumin is not exclusively dependent on nutritional status, it is part of several nutritional screening indices and is associated with nutritional conditions [6] . Interestingly, low prealbumin levels, another marker of malnutrition, have been demonstrated to predict the progression to respiratory failure and mechanical ventilation [7] . This evidence strengthens the concept that nutritional derangements should be systematically and urgently managed in patients affected by COVID-19, also considering that the immune response has been shown to be weakened by inadequate nutrition [8, 9] .",

They also underline that even patients with COVID-19 who are not at risk for malnutrition should maintain adequate protein (1.5 g/d) and calorie (25\u00c030 kcal/d) intake [11] and that several vitamins and nutrients may have the potential to benefit infected patients due to their anti-inflammatory and antioxidants properties [10] .",

However, we are unfortunately recording a significant number of patients reporting severe eating difficulties as a consequence of the symptoms. Hence, beyond a simplified nutritional risk screening procedure and biochemical nutritional markers ( Fig. 1) , we decided to start with a systematic supplementation of oral whey proteins (20 g/d) and intravenous multivitamin, multimineral, trace elements solutions (target: satisfaction of recommended dietary allowance [RDA]) upon admission). The choice of whey proteins is based on their anabolic and antioxidant properties combined with high digestibility [15, 16] . Their potential clinical benefits have been underlined in cancer cachexia [17] and have been recently shown in a randomized controlled trial with malnourished advanced cancer patients conducted by our group [18] . Whey proteins also have immunomodulatory properties [19] and potential antiviral activity [20] .

Positive pressure ventilation through a face mask may also result in gastric distention, which may adversely affect diaphragmatic function, further compromising the respiratory conditions. Receiving EN during NIV was associated with a significantly higher rate of airway complications and longer NIV duration compared with patients who did not receive EN [43] and there is currently no validated strategy to reduce the critical complications of EN among patients with NIV or CPAP [44] . Moreover, in a randomized trial conducted in an ICU setting, which compared early PN with EN in critically ill shocked patients, the EN group had higher cumulative incidences of vomiting, diarrhea, and other gastrointestinal complications, whereas no differences in mortality rates were detected [45] . A further consideration regarding the choice of PN is that patients receiving ART, which is currently being used in COVID-19 disease, are frequently likely to experience diarrhea that can contribute to treatment interruption [46, 47] and further worsen nutrient absorption. Finally, it has been shown that gastrointestinal symptoms are frequently reported in COVID-19, particularly by patients with rapid progression and worse outcome [48] , which may increase the risk for EN intolerance.",

Owing to the emergency scenario and the constantly increasing number of admitted patients, assisting even the oldest and most fragile ones during meals is time consuming and distracts health care professionals from taking care of other important procedures. Also, patients' relatives are not admitted to the wards. Hence, the accurate monitoring of food intake may be extremely difficult, if feasible at all, which we believe justifies our straight approach. Also the PN support may only partially fit the needs of pre-ICU COVID-19 patients, as central infusion lines may be rarely available outside the ICU wards and energy requirements are likely to be elevated, considering the concurrent severe acute inflammatory state and that the average BMI of COVID-19 patients is high (>27 kg/m 2 in our preliminary case histories) upon admission. Furthermore, the cardiovascular and pulmonary compliance may limit the infused volume of PN. Also, clinical nutrition units are not widespread in Italian hospitals, thus specific competences in nutritional care of patients are not available for all Italian patients. Finally, also the timely provision and availability of ONS, EN formulas, PN bags, and enteral and infusion pumps could be problematic in the current scenario.",

Also in the ICU setting, nutritional support could become very problematic, as new ICU wards are progressively being created in emergency circumstances and EN tolerance may be incomplete because of gastric distention and erosive gastritis. Hence, different strategies should be considered, like the use of supplemental PN or specific high protein-calorie, highly digestible enteral formulas enriched in v-3 fatty acids or other anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory nutrients. The use of v-3 fatty acids may be relevant because of their recognized anti-inflammatory properties [50] . However, their use should be cautiously considered on a case-by-case approach, keeping in mind their potential effect on the immune response [51] , which may interfere with the currently tested treatments for COVID-19 [1, 4] . Clinical research focused on the aforementioned nutritional issues could be decisive for this purpose, but the present emergency scenario renders it extremely difficult if not impossible to perform.",
