The term SBS has been in use for some time now and widely recognized, in spite of suggestions for alternative names, such as problem buildings, building-related occupant complaint syndrome, abused building syndrome. Acknowledging that the incidences of SBS symptoms are straightforward, its characterization and linkages to an indoor exposure require more in-depth analysis. An impediment towards this effort is to make the primary distinction as to whether the problem is chemical, biological, physical, or psychogenic. The questions to examine are the mechanism how workplace or environmental processes trigger physical health symptoms, and whether some individuals are more prone to illnesses. Further, it calls for a review on the kind of critical work settings that precipitate illness conditions, and how the work or environmental aspects influence building occupant's psychophysiological threshold, making oneself hypersensitive even to mild irritants. Priority is placed on exploring organizational interventions to restrict the spread of the syndrome and efficiently manage causes of building-related illnesses.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Several researchers indicate the SBS as a phenomenon that occurs among building occupants, perhaps one out of five building occupants reports symptoms associated with their respective place of work and attributed to the IAQ. The interactions of a multitude of factors, such as the site, climate, building system, construction materials, building dampness, contaminant sources, activities of occupants, affect the quality of indoor air. Typically, maintaining allowable IAQ in office buildings depends on effective ventilation systems in operation. Ineffective or inadequate ventilation systems result in inefficient removal of pollutants from indoor air and display signs of SBS among the occupants.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Health impact assessment addresses qualitative or quantitative evaluation of the magnitude of health consequences due to measurable environmental causation or metric, and the size of the population affected (Fehr et al. 2012; Mesa-Frias et al. 2014) . Apparent relationships exist between the external stimuli, kinds of human responses and about the type of building environment. Therefore, the discomfort and symptoms of occupants in the building require acknowledging that an exposure scenario exists, and the discomfort and disease have a strong association with psychologic or physiological components. A structured questionnaire (Table 3 .1) may be used to ascertain the SBS of the respondents in an office building. The office workers who had at least one symptom of SBS and onset of two or more symptoms at least twice weekly, overnight resolution of symptoms after leaving the workstation or building, and the absence of known medical causes, may be defined as having SBS (Ooi et al. 1998 ). The prevalence of symptoms among building occupants is linked to personal exposure to the indoor environment. The symptoms may vary during the day, in the course of changes in the concentrations of indoor pollutants. Further, the prevalence of syndrome might differ with the specificity of criteria for the definitive diagnosis of a case. Accordingly, there may be a shift in the frequency distribution of affected workers when the requirements were changed to one symptom, instead of two or more symptoms (Ooi et al. 1998) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 207, "end": 225, "text": "(Fehr et al. 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 226, "end": 249, "text": "Mesa-Frias et al. 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF135"}, {"start": 980, "end": 996, "text": "(Ooi et al. 1998", "ref_id": "BIBREF158"}, {"start": 1506, "end": 1523, "text": "(Ooi et al. 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF158"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 634, "end": 642, "text": "(Table 3", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Questionnaire Survey"}, {"text": "For measuring the concentration of indoor air pollutants, one may adopt area sampling by placing an environmental monitoring device in general building locations and placing a personal sampling device close to the nose of the person that better represents the inhaled dose of individuals.

Within the limited scope, and the author's comprehension on the subject, only a selected number of cross-sectional studies that have been reported in the recent years are briefly summarized in Table 3 .2. Different research groups emphasized on the association of prevalence of SBS symptoms among the office workers with the organic floor dust concentration, the floor covering of the workplaces, the age of the building, and the kind of ventilation system in operation. The size of the office and the number of occupants in the office were critical, presumably because of likely rise of pollutants during the day. The shelf factor was identified as a risk factor for mucosal irritation, and the fleece factor, such as fleecy surfaces, paper, and cardboard was recognized for general symptoms in the office buildings (Skov et al. 1990; M\u00f8lhave 2011) . Despite that carpets give a cozy atmosphere and an aesthetic acoustic environment in a building, carpet fibres and accumulated dust, especially the organic part of the dust, have been found to be associated with SBS, namely mucosal irritation. Further details of work and building-related respiratory illnesses are elaborated elsewhere in the chapter. The US EPA Building Assessment Survey and Evaluation (BASE) study (Apte and Erdmann 2003 ) is a landmark study covering 100 large office buildings and extensive measurements of both SBS symptoms and environmental monitoring. The occupant must have reported an occurrence of one SBS symptom, at least 1-3 days per week during the month, and resolution of the symptoms when the occupant moves away from work. Analysis indicated dose-dependent associations in many of SBS symptoms with the delta change in indoor and outdoor CO 2 concentrations.

(1989) were more among females than males might have occurred during the past year, at least 1-3 days per week and mainly during workdays or work shifts. There were significant health effects due to office work exposures, adjusting confounders such as psychosocial factors at work. Exposures to paper dust and carbonless paper that contains solvents and colour-forming chemicals increase the risk of a headache and fatigue, chronic breathlessness, and chronic bronchitis (a chronic cough and phlegm production). Exposure to carbonless paper through its touching can cause sinus infections, middle ear infections, and increased risk of eye symptoms and diarrhoea. Gupta et al. (2007) undertook a questionnaire-based investigation on the prevalence of the SBS at a multi-story centrally air-conditioned Airport Authority of India building in New Delhi. Qualitative analysis included the relationships between SBS score, CO 2 and other parameters related to building and work environment. Quantitative analysis included monitoring of pollutants, namely NO x , SO 2 , CO, and suspended particulate matter. Despite that the concentrations of pollutants complied with IAQ standards were generally within limits, the prevalence of SBS (a headache-51%, lethargy-50%, and dryness in body mucous-33%) was higher in the third floor as compared to other floors and the control tower. The third floor and the control tower of the airport were affected by infiltration, mainly from entrance doors. Hengpraprom et al. (2010) showed the influence of airborne fungi on allergic rhinitis among office occupants (49%) of a high-rise building in Bangkok. Allergic rhinitis was defined as having the symptoms of nasal congestion, an itchy nose, sneezing, and running nose without a cold in the past 12 months (Teeratakulpisarn et al. 2000) . Work-related allergic rhinitis was defined as (a) having the above symptoms with a cold at least twice in the past month; (b) expressing the manifestation at work or seeing it worsen at work; and (c) the frequency of manifestation occurred at least 1-3 days per week. Indoor humidity was strongly correlated with airborne fungi concentrations. However, the fungal concentration was not associated with work-related allergic rhinitis. Asthma and asthma-like symptoms among office workers, respiratory sensitization with exposure to hot or cold weather, the presence of visible mould, and carpeting resulted in a positive association with allergic rhinitis. Syazwan et al. (2009) compared the data of SBS and IAQ of 176 office workers in old and new buildings in Kuala Lumpur City. The investigators suggested that improvement in ventilation effectiveness and increase in ventilation rates per person may reflect on the reduction of indoor pollutants and also reduction in the prevalence of SBS in buildings. Norhidayah et al. (2013) investigated associations between IAQ parameters and SBS in three buildings in Malaysia. The prevalence of SBS symptoms, having 1 to 3 symptoms per week, was similar in the buildings. The CO concentration and fungal counts were not significantly different between the buildings. However, the observed CO 2 concentration and climatic factors suggest that the predictors of SBS might be ventilation and accumulation of contaminants within the indoor environment.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 368, "end": 386, "text": "Skov et al.

Undoubtedly, the physical and psychological disposition, on the one hand, and work-and job-related factors, on the other hand, are risk factors on the perception of the indoor environment and the pathogenesis of complaints. With a sample size of 368 office workers (*77% females) from 6 office buildings in the USA, Reynolds et al. (2001) observed that the psychosocial factors were positively correlated with the incidences of SBS in females. However, the environmental factors were correlated with symptoms in males. By examining 877 occupants (50% female) in 12 office buildings in Quebec, Canada, Donnini et al. (1997) observed no significant differences in thermal neutrality between males (23.5\u00b0C) and females (23.8\u00b0C). Females expressed significantly higher thermal dissatisfaction (63% female vs. 37% male). Nakano et al. (2002) examined 406 Japanese office workers (37% females) and noted a significant difference in thermal neutrality, i.e., females (25.1\u00b0C) and males (22.9\u00b0C), while females reported a higher frequency of SBS symptoms, as compared to the male group. In a study on 935 office occupants (48% female), in 22 office buildings in Australia, Cena and de Dear (1999) noted the votes of thermal unacceptability, and females complained of significantly higher thermal dissatisfaction than those of males. Choi et al. (2010) had a similar observation by studying 402 office workers (*53% females) from 20 office buildings in the USA. Runeson et al. (2003) investigated the prevalence and change of SBS symptoms in buildings with suspected indoor air problems about Antonovsky's sense of coherence (SOC), a psychological measure of life attitude. The study was conducted on a cohort of 194 workers from 19 Swedish buildings with indoor environmental problems between 1988 and 1998. Information on 16 SBS symptoms was gathered, as well as the SOC measure was administered in a postal follow-up. After adjusting for age, gender, history of atopy, and ETS, Runeson et al. (2003) noted that SBS was more common in women, younger ones, and those with a history of atopy. A low SOC was related to a higher prevalence of ocular, nasal, and throat symptoms, tiredness, and headache. Also, subjects with a low SOC developed more symptoms during the follow-up period. Saijo et al. (2009) undertook postal self-administered questionnaire survey to 1,582 dwellings from 40 municipal, and 24 prefectural apartment buildings in the city of Asahikawa, Japan, and 480 questionnaires were finally analysed. From the questionnaire about moisture condensation and visible mould on window panes, walls, closets, bathrooms, the perception of mouldy odour, and water leakages, a building dampness index was defined as the sum of positive dampness indicators. SBS symptoms recorded for the preceding 3-month period were-fatigue, feeling heavy-headed, headache, nausea/dizziness, difficulty in concentrating, irritation of the eyes, running nose, dry throat, cough, dry or flushed facial skin, itching of the scalp, ears, and hands. The symptoms were significantly higher among females than males. The building dampness index was also significantly related to all SBS symptoms, as also noted by Engvall et al. (2001) in the study covering 609 multi-family buildings (14,235 dwellings) in Stockholm. Saijo et al. (2009) noted allergic diseases as risk factors for SBS development, and therefore, the history of allergic diseases was taken as a confounder for SBS symptom analysis. The US NIOSH study in 80 office buildings also found a positive association between moisture and debris in the ventilation systems and lower respiratory tract symptoms (Mendell et al. 2003) . Kim et al. (2013) undertook a comprehensive literature survey, based on North American post-occupancy evaluation (POE) database (N = 38,257). The survey indicated that the satisfaction levels of female occupants were significantly lower than males on all fifteen IEQ factors (such as thermal comfort, air quality, lighting, acoustics, office layout, furnishings, cleanliness, and maintenance).

The principal component analysis (PCA) allowed to cluster VOCs into a reduced set of principal component (PC) vectors and further estimated the association between SBS symptoms and the VOC exposure metrics, using logistic regression analysis. A similar approach was taken by Apte and Daisey (1999) in exploring the causal associations between SBS and environmental stressors, using a subset of data from 28 office buildings of the US EPA BASE study. Four source-based PC vectors were derived that identify sources as photocopiers, automotive emissions, ETS, and latex paints. Regression analyses indicated significant associations between mucous membrane-related symptoms and the photocopier vector, after adjustment for age, gender, smoking status, the presence of carpeting, and thermal exposure. Sore throat symptoms were associated with the paint vector. Analysis of dataset of all 100 BASE buildings revealed 36 VOCs, formaldehyde and acetaldehyde corresponded to 41 buildings, whereas 19 VOCs were available in all buildings. The PCA yielded ten PCs identified as the VOC sources (Apte and Erdmann 2003) . Seven components referred to as furniture coatings (PC1), paint (PC2), construction materials (PC3), printing materials and processes (PC4), carpet and undercarpet (PC5), parking garage (PC6), and cleaning products (PC7) met the criterion of having eigenvectors 1.0.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 194, "end": 214, "text": "Brinke et al.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are components found in many of the air pollutants and can cause oxidative damage to lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Urinary 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) is a known biological marker of oxidative stress on DNA. Accumulation of ETS, VOCs, formaldehyde in the building due to insufficient ventilation can result in the rise of urinary 8-OHdG levels among occupants (Calderon-Garciduenas et al. 1999) . Lu et al.

There are multiple aspects of work, including physiological, motivation, technical, psychosocial, environmental, perceptual as well as organizational that attribute to work stress. As mentioned earlier, outbreaks of psychogenic illness (SBS) are perhaps a symptom of underlying stress at work and workplace (Selvamurthy and Ray 1996) . Mizoue et al. (2001) carried out a cross-sectional survey of 1281 municipal employees from different buildings in a Japanese city. Findings indicated that both ETS exposure and overtime work contributed to the development of SBS. Working overtime for 30 or more hours per month was also associated with SBS symptoms, but the occurrence of SBS reduced by 1/5th after adjustment for variables associated with overtime work and about an-half after further adjustment for perceived work overload. Runeson et al. (2006) undertook a postal questionnaire survey as regard to SBS on a sample of 1000 subjects (20-65 years of age), including the three-dimensional model of demand-control-support, regarding social support in actual work situations. Results indicated that males and females perceived psychosocial work conditions differently and reacted differently to job stressors. That is, the psychosocial work environment was as important as gender and atopy as a predictor of SBS symptoms. Nag and Nag (2004) examined the work stresses of women VDT-cum-telephone operators in selected office buildings (telephone exchanges) and observed that the behavioural response to the work stressors, and health and well-being dimensions did vary with the work schedules. The PCA analysis of the ergonomics checkpoints yielded five aspects of work, as organizational (PC1-describing job design needs, workplace interventions, and constraints of VDT workstations), environmental (PC2-covering illumination-, climate-, and noise-related hazards), mechanistic (PC3-referring to job specialization, pace of work, information handling), perceptual and motor (PC4-describing visual and auditory displays and controls), and motivational (PC5-referring to personal job characteristics and core dimensions). The loading of the work stressors explained in PC1 to PC3 appeared autonomous, irrespective of the shift schedules at which the women were engaged. The operators in the rotating shift had higher sensitivity to the stressors related to PC4. The day workers responded greater to the stressors related to the core job dimensions that reflect growth needs (PC5). The sleep disturbance, flexibility to sleeping habits, and personality dimension (neuroticism) were negatively correlated with PC1. The digestive problems, social and domestic disruption, and languidity dimensions were positively correlated to PC4 and PC5. The operators in rotating shift had increased demand in the perceptual and motor, and the motivational aspects of work, and thus causing greater negative influence on physical health symptoms, and social and domestic disruption. The job design interventions tailoring to delay the morning shift and adjust the shift length based on the work and climatic load (that is, reduce work hours in the evening shift to avoid peak workload, and extend hours of day work during the hot summer months) might alleviate work stress and enhance health and well-being.

The chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is characterized by a slowly progressive reduction of pulmonary ventilation due to a combination of emphysema and bronchiolitis with obstruction of the small airways. ETS is a critical aetiological factor. Chronic cough has different aetiologies-a cough at night or associated with physical exercise may be indications of asthma. The asthma tests such as reversibility to a bronchodilator and increased levels of exhaled nitric oxide should be positive (Chatkin et al. 1999) . Hyperventilation syndrome is indicated by symptoms induced by physiologically inappropriate hyperventilation or voluntary hyperventilation. Shortness of breath, accelerated/deepened breathing, and feeling of inability to breathe deeply are asthma-like. Symptoms reproduced by a hyperventilation test and a slow recovery of CO 2 in blood or expired air are the two criteria for establishing the diagnosis (Ringsberg and Akerlind 1999) . RADS is an illness with asthma-like symptoms that may occur as the direct consequence of excessive toxic inhalation exposure. The bronchial histological changes show an increase in inflammatory cells. However, eosinophils and mast cells do not dominate.
