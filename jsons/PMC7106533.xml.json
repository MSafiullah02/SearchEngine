Since highly virulent NDV strains cause up to 100% mortality in infected flocks, adequate control of ND is vital to ensure healthy, productive poultry populations [2]. While vaccine campaigns are routinely practiced, these are severely limited by elevated costs, need of trained personnel for adequate administration, and long term thermostability when transporting the vaccine [3]. These problems are heightened in developing countries, where vaccine costs become excessive in subsistence farming settings [3], [4], [5]. Such limitations have led researchers to explore new avenues to control problematic pathogens, such as NDV, to generate new, sustainable antiviral strategies [3], [5], [6].",

            "text": "Ribonucleic acid interference (RNAi) is a naturally occurring intracellular process found in most organisms in which gene expression is controlled through silencing of specific messenger RNAs (mRNA) [7]. RNAi pathways are capable of being activated by several avenues including micro RNA (miRNA), small interfering RNA duplexes (siRNA) and short hairpin RNA (shRNA). These mechanisms of gene silencing are evolutionarily conserved and can silence mRNA at multiple stages of expression including transcription, post-transcription, and translation [8], [9]. In the miRNA pathway, double stranded miRNAs are processed by the protein Drosha, further modified by Dicer, and the product is then integrated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) [10]. This multi-protein complex will then unravel the double stranded RNA, and retain a single guide strand which will direct the knockdown of the target sequences bases on Watson-Crick base paring [8], [11]. In the laboratory, synthetic vectors can be used to express miRNA, siRNA or shRNA, and have been widely used in the scientific community as a means to decrease viral yields by lowering the amount of viable mRNA that encodes for viral proteins, or other RNA intermediates that are necessary for viral replication [12], [13], [14]. RNAi approaches have been successfully used in studies of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), avian influenza virus (AIV), parainfluenza virus, and coronavirus (including severe acute respiratory syndrome virus) [12], [13], [14]. Alvarez et al. reported reduction in RSV viral concentrations induced by siRNA without inducing off target pro-inflammatory effects, a potential problem [15]. In similar research, suppression of AIV replication was achieved by using shRNA to knockdown expression of the viral polymerase leading to reduced bird to bird transmission of the virus [16]. These studies suggest RNAi may be highly effective in disrupting viral replication and decreasing expression of virus genes [17]. These approaches may now be applied to NDV.",

            "text": "NDV is classified as Avian Paramyxovirus serotype 1 (APMV-1), and is an enveloped virus with a negative sense, single stranded RNA genome of approximately 15 kb, which encodes six structural proteins, from 3\u2032 to 5\u2019: nucleoprotein (NP), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), fusion protein (F), hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN), and the large polymerase protein (L) [18], [19]. Using pre-miRNA to activate the cellular RNAi pathway, a miRNA can be used to target the messenger RNA of NDV structural proteins, leading to the degradation of the transcripts and inhibiting viral replication [11]. Furthermore, by coupling miRNA expression with a lentiviral (LV) delivery system, it is possible to create stable cell populations that constitutively express the miRNA sequence [8]. The use of LV vectors to incorporate exogenous genetic material into the host genome also lends to the possibility of creating transgenic animals capable of germline transmission of the transgene [20]. An LV delivering a miRNA that can induce resistance to NDV could be delivered to a donor bird at various stages resulting in an animal with an endogenous antiviral defense against NDV [6], [20]. This approach could lead the basis for a functional, preventative antiviral strategy that does not require the use of additional prophylaxis in chickens.",

At 0 h, phase images showed an intact monolayer consisting of healthy DF-1 transfected cells (Fig. 1\nA\u2013D, I\u2013L).

To isolate a homogeneous population of cells that highly express pLV-shNP and pLV-shSCR, transduced DF-1 cells underwent two rounds of FACS sorting to isolate cells that were highly GFP positive. Due to the EmGFP gene and miRNA cassette being co-cistronic, cells expressing the EmGFP should also express the miRNA product. After stable cultures of post-sorted cells were established, each of the DF-1 transduced cell populations (pLV-miR-NP and pLV-miR-SCR) and a na\u00efve control cell line (a non-transduced cell line) were challenged with LS-V at MOI 0.01. Phase contrast images at 48 and 72 h.p.i showed similar results to transfection results (Fig. 4\nA\u2013F). pLV-miR-NP cultures retain an intact monolayer at 48 h.p.i (Fig. 4A; as indicated by arrow) while the SCR control and na\u00efve DF-1 cultures show substantial syncytia formation and destruction of the monolayer (Fig. 4B\u2013C; as indicated by arrowheads). However, by 72 h.p.i additional CPE were apparent in all of the cultures including pLV-miR-NP as demonstrated by the overwhelming presence of syncytia and little to no visibly healthy cells (Fig. 4D). Further characterization of NDV resistance of pLV-miR-NP was evaluated by determining viral titers in supernatant collected after LS-V infection (MOI 0.01) at 0, 12, and 24 h.p.i. pLV-miR-NP resulted in significantly (p < 0.05) lower NDV viral titers at both 12 and 24 h time compared to pLV-miR-SCR (Fig. 4G).

Knockdown of the NP protein resulted in delayed viral replication when compared to the scramble control. In unsegmented, negative strand RNA viruses, such as NDV, the NP protein plays a significant role in the replication and transcription of NDV [24]. Specifically, NP, together with both the P and L proteins, interacts with the genomic RNA to form the ribronucleoprotein (RNP) which is the template for RNA synthesis. In this protein complex, NP encapsulates the RNA genome allowing proper function of the NDV polymerase [25], [26]. NP knockdown lowers the amount/viability of RNP and, by disrupting this essential lifecycle step, it is reasonable to suspect that knocking down the NP transcripts within infected cells resulted in the observed delay of viral replication, as shown by another group working with NDV [17]. A similar study conducted with AIV (an orthomyxovirus) also used RNAi to target several of AIV's proteins and reported knockdown of NP was notably effective in limiting production of the virus compared to other targets [27]. Furthermore, other influenza studies have also targeted the NP protein using RNAi and observed a decrease in the amount of the reciprocal viral mRNA, virion RNA and its complementary RNA [28]. The NP protein has able been indicated as a target for administering antiviral drugs [29]. Results such as these suggest that NP may be a prime target for controlling and limiting viral replication NDV and similar viruses.",

            "text": "pLV-miR-NP transduced DF-1 cells were observably healthier than control cells types up to 72 h after challenge with LS-V. However, these cells were unable to survive long term in culture with cells at 72 h.p.i., showing significant cell death and syncytia formation by at this time point. While long-term survival was not observed in vitro, it is possible that delaying the rate of infection can ultimately lead to improved animal survival. Commonly, a standard challenge dose between 105 and 106 EID50 is used experimentally to induce 100% infection and clinical signs in chickens [18]. Based on our observation that pLV-miR-NP led to a 2-fold decrease in viral titers in vitro, in theory, a transgenic bird containing our construct may require an increased amount of virus to generate an infection. It is also reasonable to consider that a decreased amount of viral titers detected could translate to a reduction in viral shedding of infected birds. Such is the case in a study completed by Lyall et al. exploring the amount of viral shedding in transgenic chickens expressing an shRNA against the polymerase of AIV [16]. Lyall describes that after viral challenge with a highly pathogenic strain of AIV, efficiency of transmission of the virus to other transgenic birds as well as non-transgenic animals was mitigated as assessed by histopathology and immunohistochemistry [16]. While some birds died in the study, the decrease of viral transmission can translate into a reduction of viral propagation to birds in close contact, decreasing the spreading of the disease and substantially contributing to outbreak control. With the success of infectivity studies with AIV, it is conceivable that similar results could be obtained with NDV challenge studies in transgenic birds.",

            "text": "Other researchers have had success using the NP protein as an anti-viral target utilizing RNAi methodology to inhibit NP expression and reduction of viral titers in culture, however this work was done in non-avian Vero cells [30]. It is more beneficial to conduct studies in an avian cell type as the NDV virus does not have to adapt to a non-native cell type, which may lead to mutations that are not naturally found in chickens. In addition, the study of RNAi approaches in avian cultures is likely to be more representative with respect to the pathophysiology of NDV. Yue et al. also showed that shRNA targeting of NP in chicken embryonic fibroblasts lead to knockdown of viral NP mRNA [17]. However, this study failed to examine the effect of constitutive expression of the NP shRNA and only examine transient expression. Understanding the effect of continued long term expression is a key component if this technology is ever to be translated to use in live animals in a production setting. In this study, the miRNA sequences were designed based on conserved regions among genotype II representatives. This genotype was selected because of the extensive characterization of LS-V (a representative of genotype II), both in vivo and in vitro. In order to provide protection against the many NDV genotypes circulating worldwide (eighteen described so far [31]), other conserved genomic regions, in close proximity of the one used here, could be used to generate a broadly protective effect. For instance, this could be accomplished by deploying chaining pre-miRNAs that could deliver multiple miRNA species, therefore targeting multiple conserved regions at the same time.",

This study suggests that future transgenic animal studies are warranted. This would likely result in animals that are capable of having endogenous resistance to NDV infections and can have progressive benefits for small village farmers as well as large scale international poultry operations. With potential widespread adoption of resistant transgenic birds, one day the production of resistant animals maybe even more cost effective than the use of standard vaccine programs. Traditional vaccine programs have associated costs of transportation, logistics and infrastructure to maintain a cold chain, labor costs to administer vaccines and the cost of lost birds due to ineffective vaccines. In addition, the use of miRNA NDV resistant birds in economically impoverished countries and rural areas where vaccines are not readily available would be potentially paradigm changing by providing food and financial security.",
