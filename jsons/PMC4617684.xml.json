The mouse Ly49 family of molecules is expressed on NK cells that recognize the \u03b11 and \u03b12 subunits of H-2D MHC class I molecules (Karlhofer, Ribaudo, & Yokoyama, 1992). Interestingly, MCMV-resistant mouse strains, but not MCMV-susceptible strains, express the activating receptor Ly49H, which also binds to m157 but initiates NK killing of the infected cells (Smith et al., 2002). This suggests that virus and host together have evolved to modulate signaling through this receptor. In fact, when MCMV is continuously passaged in Ly49H positive cells in culture, the virus will quickly generate mutations in m157 to avoid binding to the activating receptor (Voigt et al., 2003).",

            "text": "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) expresses the protein UL18, a homolog of MHC class I antigens (Cosman et al., 1997, Reyburn et al., 1997). MCMV also expresses m144, which also functions as a MHC class I mimic and is required for efficient viral replication in vivo (Farrell et al., 1997). Both UL18 and m144 form the three \u03b1 domains typical of MHC class I molecules and both can bind to \u03b22M (Farrell et al., 1997, Reyburn et al., 1997). UL18 can bind to both CD94/NKG2 and leukocyte inhibitory receptor (LIR)-1 and it is thought that m144 may interact similarly. The CD94/NKG2 receptors recognize the nonclassical MHC class I molecules human HLA-E and mouse Qa1 (Brooks et al., 1999, Houchins et al., 1997, Lee et al., 1998, Vance et al., 1998), which are expressed on all cell types except red blood cells (Kuroki, Furukawa, & Maenaka, 2012). Human LIR-1 recognizes epitopes shared by most MHC class I molecules through interactions with the \u03b13 and \u03b22M domains (Chapman et al., 1999, Willcox et al., 2003). In fact, LIR-1 binds to UL18 more tightly than host class I molecules (Chapman et al., 1999), indicating that this receptor may have evolved specifically to bind to UL18. Furthermore, the leader sequence of the HCMV protein UL40 is identical to the MHC class I, HLA-E associated peptide HLA-Cw03. CD94/NKG2A will recognize HCMV-infected cells as self based on presentation of the HLA-E-like peptide and will not kill them (Ulbrecht et al., 2000).",

The inhibitory receptor NKR-P1B, expressed mainly on NK cells (Voigt et al., 2007), recognizes Clr-b as a ligand, which is expressed on almost all hematopoietic cells (Carlyle et al., 2004). Following infection with RCMV, there is a rapid upregulation of RCTL, which counteracts downregulation of Clr-b expression by host cells in response to infection. Through a non-MHC class I recognition mechanism, RCTL inhibits NK cell-mediated lysis by directly interacting with NKR-P1B. Furthermore, RCTL-deficient virus exhibits decreased virulence and is more easily cleared from the host by NK cells (Voigt et al., 2007). Interestingly, the activation receptor NKR-P1A also recognizes RCTL, indicating that host defenses have evolved to counteract the ability of RCTL to evade recognition.",

SIRP\u03b1, expressed mainly on myeloid cells and neurons (Adams et al., 1998, Alblas et al., 2005), binds to CD47 to regulate leukocyte chemotaxis and proinflammatory cytokine production (Cameron, Barrett, Mann, et al., 2005).

The activating receptor, SIRP\u03b2 does not bind to CD47, and its ligand is unknown, but may have evolved to counteract pathogen infections and/or recognize pathogen-infected cells (Arase and Lanier, 2004, Barclay and Brown, 2006).",

Instead, human CD200R1 contains three cytoplasmic tyrosine residues, Y291, Y294, and Y302 (Y286, Y289, and Y297 in the mouse), one of which, Y302/Y297, is located within a phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain recognition motif (NPxY). Stimulation by CD200 leads to the phosphorylation of these tyrosines by Src kinases, which recruit the adapter protein downstream of tyrosine kinase (Dok) 2 through its PTB domain (Mihrshahi et al., 2009, Mihrshahi and Brown, 2010, Zhang et al., 2004). Y302/Y297 and to a lesser extent Y291/Y286 are the major tyrosine residues required for CD200R1 association with Dok2 (Mihrshahi et al., 2009, Zhang and Phillips, 2006). Dok2 serves as the major initiator of signaling through CD200R1, beginning with binding to Ras-GTPase activating protein (RasGAP) and is required for CD200R1 function (Mihrshahi et al., 2009). This is in contrast to ITIM containing inhibitory receptors, which utilize SHPs and SHIP-1 as the major initiator proteins and Dok proteins as secondary modulators of downstream signaling (Daeron et al., 2008, Mihrshahi et al., 2009).",

In CD200 KO mice, microglial cells exhibited increased proliferation, activation, and higher expression of MHC II, tumor necrosis factor (TNF\u03b1), and iNOS during infection in chronic T. gondii encephalitis. CD200 KO mice also exhibited decreased parasite burden and decreased mortality compared to WT mice following chronic infection. This is likely due to the fact that CD200 KO mice exhibit an increased inflammatory phenotype in response to the TLR ligands, including significantly higher IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 release and I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation (Costello et al., 2011). It is known that T. gondii stimulation of mouse TLR11 induces IL-12, which is key for the survival of the host (Yarovinsky et al., 2005). TLRs 2 and 4 have also been implicated in the inflammatory response to T. gondii (Debierre-Grockiego et al., 2007). These data show that in the case of Toxoplasmosis, increased inflammatory responses, likely through TLR signaling, are detrimental to the pathogen.",

Upregulation of CD200 was essential for replication and development of systemic Leishmaniasis as L. amazonensis replication and virulence are significantly decreased in CD200 KO mice. Virulence of L. amazonensis can be restored by treatment with soluble CD200-Fc. Not all species of Leishmania have evolved this mechanism, as L. major, which causes cutaneous but not systemic disease, does not induce CD200. However, CD200-Fc treatment in L. major-infected WT mice shifts its virulence to that of L. amazonensis (Cortez et al., 2011). L. amazonensis has evolved to utilize CD200 expression as a mechanism for inhibiting both NO production and induction of iNOS during infection. This was confirmed by treatment of macrophages with an iNOS inhibitor, which, in turn, lead to increased replication of L. major. Interestingly, L. amazonensis increased CD200 expression on macrophages. Macrophages have generally been found to express CD200R1, which can then interact with nonmyeloid cells expressing CD200. These findings suggest that, at least in the case of L. amazonensis, macrophages can inhibit neighboring macrophages by expressing both CD200R1 and CD200. Macrophages infected with intracellular pathogens can release exosomes, small vesicles containing various membrane proteins, which can provide signals to na\u00efve macrophages (Bhatnagar, Shinagawa, Castellino, & Schorey, 2007). It may be that these exosomes contain CD200, which can then bind to CD200R1 on nearby macrophages. Whether or how this would occur is not clear, though it is certainly an interesting possibility. Alternatively, macrophages expressing CD200 may interact with activated T-cells expressing CD200R1.",

Furthermore, CD200 expression is upregulated in bone marrow macrophages following infection with N. meningitidis. This is likely due to recognition of Neisserial LPS by TLR4, since TLR ligation can increase CD200 surface expression in macrophages (Mukhopadhyay et al., 2010). These data suggest that in WT mice, CD200:CD200R1 signaling plays a role in regulating the response to N. meningitidis, but does not necessarily affect the survival of the pathogen. Therefore, increased mortality in this model is mediated by uncontrolled inflammation, not uncontrolled pathogen replication.",

Furthermore, in patients chronically infected with Schistosoma haematobium, there was a correlation between CD200R1 expression and parasite load and almost all IL-4 secreting CD4 T-cells were CD200R1 positive.

Furthermore, there are three enhancer sites (cis-elements) upstream of the CD200 transcriptional start site, a NF-\u03baB binding site, an IFN\u03b3-activation site (GAS), and an IFN-stimulatory response element-2, that are important for inducible CD200 expression. NF-\u03baB, STAT1, and IFN regulator factor-1 bind to these enhancer elements, respectively (Chen et al., 2009). Furthermore, it was determined that the NF-\u03baB transcription factor, c-Rel, was required for TLR-induced upregulation of CD200 (Mukhopadhyay et al., 2010). Perhaps pathogens utilize these enhancer sites and transcription factors to induce CD200 expression following TLR recognition. CD200 is also a target of p53 and is upregulated on apoptotic cells to decrease responsiveness to self-antigen (Rosenblum et al., 2004).",

These mice demonstrated more weight loss and increased mortality in response to influenza than WT mice (Karnam et al., 2012, Snelgrove et al., 2008), even though viral clearance was similar in both strains. CD200 KO mice also had higher levels of NO in lung homogenates, as well as increased levels of IL-6, TNF\u03b1, IFN\u03b3, and macrophage inflammatory protein 1\u03b1 in lavage fluids. Furthermore, the administration of CD200-Fc or anti-CD200R1 agonist was able to partially reverse the phenotype of CD200 KO mice, leading to less weight loss and lower cellularity than untreated CD200 KO mice following infection (Snelgrove et al., 2008). In WT mice, alveolar macrophages exhibit increased expression of CD200R1, which would serve to limit inflammatory responses to the virus, and thus, limit immunopathology (Snelgrove et al., 2008). In this case, the role of the CD200:CD200R1 axis is to protect the host from cytokine storm, which is the major cause of morbidity and mortality.",

This is thought to occur because during the resolution phase of an influenza infection, apoptotic monocytes/macrophages in the lung express CD200 on their surface while alveolar macrophages upregulate CD200R1 surface expression. This leads to decreased alveolar macrophage responsiveness and increased susceptibility to bacterial superinfections. Interestingly, CD200R1 KO mice exhibit decreased viral pathogenesis and pathology in response to influenza infection (Goulding et al., 2011). These results seem counter-intuitive compared to the previous findings with CD200 KO mice. However, the authors suggest that this may be due to the limited expression of the receptor, compared to the broad expression of the ligand, but further studies need to be performed in order to prove this. Nonetheless, the increased inflammatory response seen in CD200R1 KO mice provides protection to the host in terms of a bacterial superinfection.",

A variety of cell types, including myeloid cells, upregulate CD200R1 on their surface following ocular HSV-1 infection (Sarangi et al., 2009). CD200-Fc treatment of ocular HSV-1 infected mice caused decreased CD11b + immune cells in the cornea, decreased inflammatory lesions, and decreased angiogenesis. These mice also had decreased cellularity in the spleen and draining lymph nodes and this was associated with a decrease in IFN\u03b3-producing T-cells and an increase in FoxP3 + T-regulatory cells both in lymphoid tissue and the cornea. Treatment also mildly reduced lesions in chronically infected mice, though this would need to be combined with another drug to prove efficacious. These results indicate that CD200:CD200R1 signaling plays a key role in modulating inflammation during a viral infection and provides further evidence that decreasing the inflammatory milieu following a viral infection can actually have a beneficial role for unwanted immunopathology.",

            "text": "We have recently examined the role of the CD200:CD200R1 axis in the mouse model of HSV-1 encephalitis (Soberman et al., 2012). A significant component of the morbidity and mortality in this model is the release of cytokines and chemokines triggered by the interaction of HSV-1 with macrophages and resident microglial cells through TLR2 (Kurt-Jones et al., 2004). Therefore, we predicted that CD200R1 KO mice would show increased morbidity and mortality in response to HSV-1 infection. However, CD200R1 KO mice were markedly protected against infection and exhibited a decrease in viral titers and HSV-1 glycoprotein expression in the brain. Furthermore, the levels of IFN\u03b2 were decreased in both the serum and brain, suggesting that the main driving force in survival was decreased viral replication (Soberman et al., 2012). Whether decreased viral titers are due to increased antipathogenic defenses in CD200R1 KO mice or due to a direct effect of CD200R1 on viral replication remains to be determined. When we examined the interaction of HSV-1 with thioglycollate-induced peritoneal macrophages we uncovered a potentially far more complex relationship between CD200R1 and cell signaling by TLR2. Rather than show an amplified generation of IL-6 in response to HSV-1, the cytokine response was blunted by 80%. This was not seen in response to LPS, a TLR4 ligand. Furthermore, the surface expression of TLR2 following HSV-1 infection of macrophages was not upregulated (Soberman et al., 2012).",

Although vOX2 shares 36\u201340% identity with human CD200, both vOX2 and CD200 bind to CD200R1 with equivalent affinity and avidity (Foster-Cuevas et al., 2004, Misstear et al., 2012). In vitro, vOX2 can downregulate TNF\u03b1, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 release from macrophages activated with IFN\u03b3 and LPS (Foster-Cuevas et al., 2004). When comparing the function of CD200 and vOX2, Misstear et al. (2012) found that APCs (cell lines that express native HLA-A2 and HLA-B8) transduced to express either CD200 or vOX2 suppressed T-cell IFN\u03b3 secretion, ERK1/2 and AKT phosphorylation, and mobilization of CD107a. CD200 and vOX2 also contributes to maintenance of the homeostasis of antigen-specific T-cell responses in vivo by negatively regulating their activity in a manner similar to CTLA-4 and PDL-1/2 (Misstear et al., 2012). Human herpesviruses 6 and 7 also express CD200 orthologs that bind to human CD200R1 (Shiratori et al., 2005), though their function is not as well characterized.",

With approximately 56% identity to the host CD200 protein, e127 binds to CD200R1 with equivalent affinity, however, it does not significantly affect viral replication or myeloid activity in vitro or in vivo (Foster-Cuevas et al., 2011). This suggests that although CD200 mimics provide an evolutionary advantage to a variety of pathogens, its role may not be entirely the same in each infection and its effect upon binding to CD200R1 may differ.",

Understanding how these infectious agents use the CD200:CD200R1 axis to downregulate host defenses can potentially be exploited in clinical settings.

This drug could also be used to treat pathogenic infections that are impacted by CD200:CD200R1 signaling. In addition to utilizing currently available therapeutics for the treatment of viral infections, it is an intriguing possibility to target viral CD200 orthologs to stimulate viral clearance, as opposed to blocking all signaling through targeting the host CD200 or CD200R1. This virus-specific targeting strategy would allow normal host immune response regulation to continue, avoiding potential immunopathology, while blocking the ability of a virus to replicate unchecked.",

Viral infections in renal transplant recipients, for example, remain a significant problem (Weikert & Blumberg, 2008). In situations where they become difficult to control with antiviral therapy, the major option is to decrease immunosuppressive therapy and restore host antiviral defenses. Viruses most commonly associated with transplant tolerance include CMV, HSV-1, HHV8, Epstein\u2013Barr, Varicella Zoster, BK, and PC viruses (Weikert & Blumberg, 2008). Though pretransplant screening combined with prophylactic treatment with antiviral therapy has been very effective in limiting morbidity caused by these infectious agents, there are times when this is not sufficient, especially with BK and PC viruses. Since some of these viruses target the CD200:CD200R1 signaling pathway, and likely more, blocking the interaction of CD200 with CD200R1 using an antibody or small molecule approach could support more efficient viral clearance while preserving immunosuppression.",

            "text": "There are still many questions about how CD200R1 regulates inflammatory responses in myeloid cells and T-cells. Only a few studies have looked at the signaling molecules within cells that associate with the cytoplasmic domain of CD200R1 following ligation with CD200. Furthermore, our recent findings that CD200R1 plays an immunomodulatory role in TLR2 surface expression and signaling add another level of complexity to an already multifunctional signaling interaction. The concept that inhibitory receptors can be multifunctional and may be required for proinflammatory signaling has emerged. For example, the T- and B-cell coreceptor CD150 contains a motif in its cytoplasmic tail, called the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motif (ITSM), that can recruit either inhibitory or activating molecules (Shlapatska et al., 2001). Additionally, the NK cell receptor 2B4 can induce either inhibitory or activating signals depending on the level of expression, amount of receptor cross-linking, and availability of adaptor molecules (Chlewicki, Velikovsky, Balakrishnan, Mariuzza, & Kumar, 2008). Although CD200R1 has neither an ITIM nor an ITSM domain, it is possible that an alternative domain in the cytoplasmic tail can modulate anti- or proinflammatory signals. This is the case for the inhibitory receptors CTLA-4, Tim-3, Lag-3, and CD160, none of which contain ITIM or ITSM motifs (Odorizzi & Wherry, 2012).",
