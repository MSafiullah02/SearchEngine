In many parts of the world, particularly in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere such as the United States and Europe, the etiologic agents associated with ILI have been well characterized. In much of Latin America, however, the epidemiology and etiology of ILI are poorly understood. ILI can be attributed to a wide range of respiratory viruses, including influenza viruses, adenoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), enteroviruses, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), and parainfluenza viruses. Adenovirus, RSV, and parainfluenza viruses can cause severe disease particularly in children, accounting for a considerable proportion of childhood morbidity and mortality [1], [2]. Enteroviruses and HSV have been isolated from patients with acute respiratory infections and these viruses may also cause infections such as pharyngitis [3], [4]. Patients infected by these diverse viral pathogens present with widely overlapping symptomology, which render clinical diagnosis unreliable and severely limits etio-epidemiological studies.",

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that globally there are 3\u20135 million severe cases and 250,000\u2013500,000 deaths globally [5] due to influenza every year, with most deaths occurring among elderly populations. Influenza viruses are genetically labile and are thus able to adapt and elude the host immune response, leading to regular seasonal influenza circulation and occasional pandemic events [5]\u2013[7]. Vaccination is considered the best transmission prevention method; however, the vaccine must be updated annually to match the circulating influenza strains [8]. Through an international influenza surveillance network, the WHO identifies the viral strains that are to be included in the vaccine for the following transmission period in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres [9]\u2013[11]. Selecting the appropriate antigens for the annual vaccine requires surveillance systems to be in place worldwide to monitor circulating variants.",

In 2006, to strengthen the National Peruvian surveillance program, the MoH Sub-committee of Influenza Surveillance invited the US Naval Medical Research Center Detachment (NMRCD) in Lima, Peru to assist in increasing surveillance coverage by establishing new sentinel sites. Since then, NMRCD has augmented the existing program with support for obtaining and processing samples from new sentinel sites as well as providing data to the Epidemiology Directorate and the National Institute of Health of Peru. The objectives of the present study were to describe the clinical and epidemiological presentation of ILI in the study population, identify the etiologic agents associated with ILI, and molecularly characterize the influenza viruses isolated from patient specimens. Herein we present the data on the viral agents causing ILI in Peru from June 2006 through May 2008, based on results from NMRCD-MoH study sites in 13 cities across the country.",

As expected, influenza A (23.8% of the total cases) was the predominant diagnosis. During the period of the study, however, we also observed the introduction and emergence of influenza B viruses in these study sites. In addition, parainfluenza viruses, enteroviruses, adenoviruses, and HSV were isolated from patient specimens, which collectively contributed to 8.8% of all ILI cases in our study. The prevalences of influenza A and B viruses were significantly higher in ILI patients older than 5 years of age (p<0.001), while other viruses such as parainfluenza, adenovirus, enterovirus, HSV and RSV were more prevalent among participants younger than 5 years. These results are consistent with studies in other regions of South America [18], [19]. Taken together, these data demonstrate that a wide range of viruses need to be considered during the diagnosis of human respiratory illness.",

In addition to the respiratory symptoms, we found that 11 (6.2%) HSV-positive participants also had vesicular lesions on the lips, mouth or throat. Mc Millan [3], in a 16-month study of U.S. college students, found that 5.7% of patients with sore throats had HSV infection and, of those 34% had vesicular lesions and 71% had pharyngeal erithema. In our study, in the majority of cases where HSV was isolated, no other viral infection was detected. However, as HSV is a latent virus that may be reactivated during infections with other pathogens, we cannot conclude that HSV is the causative agent for the infections reported in this study. In addition, it should be noted that nearly 60% of total ILI cases were undiagnosed; suggesting that in HSV-positive cases where no other infection was detected as-of-yet unidentified pathogens may be responsible for the ILI symptoms. A control group without ILI symptoms will be needed to draw more definite conclusions on the role of HSV as a causative agent of ILI symptoms. Nevertheless these data suggest that in the future, HSV should be considered in diagnostic evaluations as a potential cause of ILI.",

However, it should be noted that almost all detected influenza strains and lineages were found in all study sites, suggesting that newly introduced viral strains will spread to all regions of the country. In addition, while two years is not sufficient time for an adequate description of the seasonal patterns of influenza transmission; we did observe trends in different regions. In the southern highlands, sunny days and dry weather are characteristic during the autumn and spring. It was during the winter season when temperatures fall to 3 to \u22125\u00b0C that an increased number of influenza A and B cases were detected in both 2006 and 2007. This is consistent with unpublished data from the MoH.

Additionally, we are unable to calculate incidence rates based on our study due to this bias and the lack of reliable population data. To address this shortcoming, we are establishing community-based active surveillance programs in several of these sites to better quantify the impact of ILIs on the population at large. One advantage of the present surveillance is the ability to identify increases in the number of patients seeking medical attention due to ILI symptoms and the diagnosis of the viruses related to such increases, while requiring fewer resources than would be necessary in a population-based study. Furthermore, we found similar influenza viruses present throughout the country, suggesting that a sentinel surveillance program is sufficient for detecting and describing currently circulating influenza lineages.",

These genotypes include isolates that circulated in Peru in 2006 but have not been detected since. It is unclear whether this genotype has become extinct or whether it continues to circulate at low levels in the Peruvian population. Importantly, our genetic analyses revealed that the recommended 2007 vaccine strain A/New Caledonia/20/99 does not group with the H1N1 strains that circulated in Peru in 2007, suggesting that the vaccine was not protective against the 2007 circulating strains.

In this study, 15% of the participants had received antibiotics prior to enrollment, and thus prior to a definitive diagnosis. A large percentage of these participants were found to have a viral agent associated with their illness. These data demonstrate that unnecessary antibiotic use is common for treatment of a patient with influenza-like illness, even without a definitive diagnosis of the etiologic agent [21]. For many of these participants the purchase of antibiotics combinated with paying for the clinic visit can be a major economic imposition thus, it is important to have a better understanding of the pathogens most commonly associated with ILI in the region for both diagnostic and economic purposes. In this study, RIT results were available at the time of enrollment, which helped decrease the unnecessary continual use of antibiotics and thus provided an additional economic benefit for the patients. Unfortunately our study design does not permit us to determine definitively what percentage of participants received antibiotics following a positive RIT result, as follow up interviews were not conducted. We also did not ask participants about use of antiviral drugs since viral inhibitors are not a commonly used treatment for influenza infection in Peru, mostly due to their high cost and low availability. It is interesting to note, nonetheless, that we found that a high percentage of circulating influenza A H3N2viruses are resistant to antiviral drugs such as Amantadine based on secondary analysis of these isolates [22].",
