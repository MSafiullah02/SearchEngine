Use of 10 mol% Pd2(dba)3/30 mol% L1 with either K3PO4 or Cs2CO3 in DME gave ca. 50% product yields (entries 10 and 11).

At 10 mol% Pd(OAc)2/15 mol% L2 an excellent 88% product yield was realized (entry 14), which decreased to 67% when the catalytic load was reduced by half (entry 15). When L2 was replaced with L3, the higher and lower catalyst load produced identical, good results (entries 16 and 17). On the basis of these experiments, substrate 2b was then investigated. At 10 mol% Pd(OAc)2/15 mol% L2, again an excellent 88% yield of aminated product was obtained (entry 18), which remained unaltered when the catalyst load was decreased (entry 19). Upon replacement of L2 with L3, some other differences emerged. Use of the higher 10 mol% Pd(OAc)2/15 mol% L3 resulted in an excellent 92% yield of product, but reduction of the catalytic load by half produced only a 74% yield (compare entries 20 and 21).

Good yields were obtained with 5 mol% Pd(OAc)2/7.5 mol% L3 (entries 1 and 2), and some improvement was attained with the increased catalyst load of 10 mol% Pd(OAc)2/15 mol% L3 (entries 3 and 4). More interestingly, chloropurine analogues 2a and 2b are also highly effective in these reactions and provide comparable product yields to the bromopurine nucleoside derivatives at the higher catalyst loading of 10 mol% Pd(OAc)2/15 mol% L3. Thus, contrary to prior results,29 our data indicate that it is unnecessary to involve the iodo nucleosides in Pd\u2010catalyzed syntheses of nucleoside dimers.",

Unfortunately, none showed specifically interesting activity at subtoxic concentrations as shown in Tables S2\u2013S5 of the Supporting Information. Instead, several compounds showed a mild cytostatic and/or cytotoxic activity against a variety of cell lines (CC50 or MIC in the 10 to 100 \u03bcg mL\u22121 range). Only the desilylated product from 4f was endowed with a marked cytostatic activity against CRFK cells (CC50: 4.32 \u03bcM). This compound should be further explored for its potential antiproliferative activity against a broad variety of tumor cell lines. Pd\u2010catalyzed C\u2014N and C\u2014C bond\u2010forming reactions have led to this diverse set of compounds for antiviral and cytostatic analysis that would otherwise not be available.",

Herein we show that 5 mol% Pd(OAc)2/7.5 mol% Xantphos is a generally effective catalyst in combination with Cs2CO3 in PhMe at 100 \u00b0C for reactions of 6\u2010bromopurine ribonucleosides as well as the 2\u2032\u2010deoxy analogues. Remarkably, the corresponding 6\u2010chloropurine nucleosides are also excellent substrates for such reactions, requiring 10 mol% Pd(OAc)2/15 mol% Xantphos, under otherwise comparable conditions. Finally, the method has been applied to the synthesis of deoxyadenosine\u2010deoxyadenosine and adenosine\u2010adenosine dimers. Bromo\u2010 as well as chloropurine ribo\u2010 and deoxyribonucleosides are effective substrates for reactions with protected 2\u2032\u2010deoxyadenosine and adenosine. Therefore, the methodology described appears to present broad generality and scope for nucleoside modification with both 6\u2010bromo and 6\u2010chloropurine nucleosides.",

Viral cytopathicity was recorded as soon as it reached completion in the control virus\u2010infected cell cultures that were not treated with the test compounds. The minimal cytotoxic concentration (MCC) of the compounds was defined as the compound concentration that caused a microscopically visible alteration of cell morphology. The CC50 was defined as the compound concentration that resulted in a 50% reduction of the MTT\u2010 or MTS\u2010directed (blue) viability staining of the (CRFK and MDCK) cell cultures. The methodology of the anti\u2010HIV assays was as follows: human lymphocyte MT\u20104 cells (ca. 3\u00d7105 cells/mL) were infected with 100 CCID50 of HIV(IIIB) or HIV\u20102(ROD)/mL and seeded in 200 \u03bcL wells of a microtiter plate containing appropriate dilutions of the test compounds.
