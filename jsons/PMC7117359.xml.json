Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) is a virulent biotype of feline enteric coronavirus (FECV), a low pathogenic FCoV that induces mild enteritis in kittens. The analysis of FIPV and FECV genomes suggests that FIPV may arise from FECV by a series of genomic mutations that provide the virus with the ability to replicate within cells of the monocytic lineage and thus to disseminate throughout the body (Vennema et al., 1998, Pedersen et al., 2009, Chang et al., 2010).",

Usually a predominantly humoral immunity response is considered ineffective in virus neutralization since the presence of antibodies could enhance the uptake of FCoVs by macrophages (Pedersen, 2009). In this type of immune response the deposition of macrophages and virus-antibody complexes around small venules leads to a pyogranulomatous vasculitis that is responsible for the formation of effusions typical of wet FIP.",

Conversely, if the cell-mediated response is weak and unable to reduce virus replication an intermediate response can also occur with a continuous release of virokines and chemokines that recruit neutrophils and macrophages into infection sites. This leads to the formation of pyogranulomas, typical of dry FIP. Dry FIP may also become effusive in the terminal stage of the disease when the immune system collapses. Thus, the development of FIP depends on the balance between humoral and cellular immune response (Pedersen, 2009). The cytokine interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) is one of the main modulators of cell mediated immunity (Berg et al., 2005). IFN-\u03b3 shifts the immune response from T-helper 2 to T-helper 1 with a consequent enhancement of immune cytotoxic activity due to the activation of macrophages and CD8+ T cells. This type of immunity can protect the host against the development of the disease or even more against the infection (Pedersen, 2009).",

A systematic approach based upon the synthesis and testing of large sets of overlapping peptides is very expensive. In contrast, bioinformatic prediction is extremely cheap and can be useful for selecting potentially immunogenic peptide regions, reducing the number of peptides to be screened. The strategy that combines the predictive power of these theoretical approaches with experimental in vitro or in vivo approaches allows a reliable and rapid identification of T cell stimulating epitopes (Schirle et al., 2001). Many web-based databases and prediction algorithms are now available and have been applied successfully to predict T-cell stimulating epitopes in infectious disease, cancer, autoimmunity and allergy.",

Experimental studies reported a low morbidity rate in cats inoculated with \u201cvirulent\u201d FCoVs formerly classified as FIPV (Pedersen, 1987, Kipar et al., 2001, Dean et al., 2003, Kiss et al., 2004). All these findings support the hypothesis that the development of FIP depends on a specific FCoV\u2013host interaction, mostly based on cell-mediated immunity (Pedersen, 1987, Pedersen, 2009). In turn, the strength of the immune response could be influenced by viral epitopes, since immune-modulating sequences have been found in the FCoV genome (Zhao et al., 2007). The resistance/susceptibility to FCoV infection could thus depend on a balance between individual factors referred to both the virus (type of immunomodulating peptides) and the host (cell response to specific epitopes).",

Some sequences were found both in cats with FIP and in faeces from clinically healthy cats and we thus designed these additional peptides that have been classified as \u201cmixed\u201d. Specifically, peptides corresponding to the residues 14, 182, 198 of protein N of FCoVs were selected using a bioinformatic approach. Immunomic tools have been largely applied in several species (De Groot et al., 2003, D\u00edaz et al., 2009), but not in cats. Thus, in this study, epitope mapping algorithms designed for human and mouse were used since the sequence analysis of feline MHC class I reveals a remarkable conservation of both nucleotide sequence and functional organization with human and mouse MHC loci (Yuhki et al., 1989). Obviously, a more classical approach using overlapping peptides from the N protein would have provided a more exhaustive determination of T-cell epitopes. However, the bioinformatic approach allowed us to save time and resources by selecting only those peptides with a high probability to be immunologically relevant.",

Unfortunately we do not have information about the IFN-\u03b3 concentration in the plasma of 6 cats, 5 of which had high level of IFN-\u03b3 in P0. Thus, we cannot definitely conclude whether this high level in P0 was due to an even higher concentration of IFN-\u03b3 in plasma (suggesting that cat #2 was hyper-responsive) or if their plasma values were normal (suggesting that in the majority of cats, including cat #2, the simple incubation activates IFN-\u03b3 production). The first hypothesis, however, is more likely, based on the results from cats in which both plasma and P0 values were analyzed and on RT-PCR results, that were negative in 3 out of 4 P0 samples consistently with that reported in a previous study (Gelain et al., 2006) on incubation of feline whole blood.",

Nevertheless in most cases the incubation with peptides further decreased the concentration of IFN-\u03b3 compared with P0, especially after incubation with the peptides designed around residues 14 and 182 and with the peptide designed on the \u201cvirulent\u201d sequence around residue 198. Moreover, in this case, the decreased IFN-\u03b3 concentration could be due to the degradation of pre-existing IFN-\u03b3 (possibly induced by the peptides itself) not associated with an equivalent IFN-\u03b3 production since RT-PCR did not suggest an increased mRNA expression compared with P0 after incubation with most of these peptides. Conversely, both the concentration of IFN-\u03b3 and mRNA expression increased in individual cats, especially after incubation with peptides designed on the basis of \u201cavirulent\u201d or \u201cmixed\u201d sequences of the residue 198 peptide.

The preliminary results about the responses to FCoV peptides are encouraging but further investigations on the possible role of protein N immunostimulating epitopes. Specifically, although biased by the low number of observations and by the high individual variability, these results suggest that some sequences of FCoV protein N from \u201cavirulent\u201d or \u201cmixed\u201d strains can stimulate cell-mediated immunity, especially in cats in which cell-mediated immunity is primed by chronic diseases.
