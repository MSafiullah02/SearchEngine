            "text": "It is estimated that 48.9% of practicing dermatologists are female (AAMC Data and Reports, 2017). Given that 48.8% of physicians under the age of 35 are female (American Medical Association, 2015), a significant portion of both female trainees and attending physicians are of childbearing age. In particular, dermatologists, pediatricians, and other health care workers (HCWs) in these offices routinely care for patients who present with infections with cutaneous manifestations. For pregnant HCWs, balancing patient care responsibilities and occupational safety can be challenging, especially when the risk of transmission in the clinical setting is unknown. To our knowledge, there is no comprehensive review of the literature that specifically identifies risk of transmission of common exanthematous diseases to pregnant HCWs. This review identifies various infectious exanthems that pregnant HCWs may be exposed to and summarizes current available evidence regarding risk of transmission. Specifically, we discuss parvovirus B19, hand, foot and mouth disease, mycoplasma-induced rash and mucositis, measles, herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, and pityriasis rosea. We also provide guidelines for each disease in order for pregnant HCWs and HCWs of reproductive potential to appropriately minimize risk and pursue work-up and treatment, if necessary, following exposure. Finally, given the ongoing global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), we also summarize available safety guidelines for pregnant HCWs who are working during this time.",

            "text": "A wide range of clinical manifestations have been associated with parvovirus B19 (PVB19) infection, including erythema infectiosum, arthropathy and aplastic crisis. Erythema infectiosum is the most common dermatologic manifestation of PVB19, presenting in children between the ages of 5 and 14 following a prodrome. The classic presentation involves a facial rash with a \u201cslapped-cheek\u201d appearance, followed by a morbilliform eruption on the extremities and trunk one to four days later. Once the rash appears, patients are no longer contagious (Servey et al., 2007). As such, while providers are at risk of infection during the PVB19 prodromal phase, they are likely protected if patients present with rash.",

            "text": "While the disease course itself is self-limiting, PVB19 infection during pregnancy has been attributed to several adverse fetal outcomes including intrauterine fetal demise, thrombocytopenia and hydrops fetalis. Transmission occurs primarily via exposure to droplets and fomites but can also occur via vertical transmission. The rate of baseline immunity to PVB19 in pregnant populations ranges from 35% to 65% (Gillespie et al., 1990, Gratac\u00f3s et al., 1995, Valeur-Jensen et al., 1999). The incidence of acute PVB19 infection in susceptible pregnant women is reported to be 1-2%, with an estimated vertical transmission rate of approximately 25-35% (Gratac\u00f3s et al., 1995, Neu et al., 2015). Risks for childcare workers, including school teachers and day-care center employees, is well documented in the literature (Riipinen et al., 2014). A population-based cohort study in Denmark of over 30,000 pregnant women found that working as a nursery school teacher and having more children in the household were among the greatest risk factors associated with acquiring parvovirus infection (Valeur-Jensen, et al., 1999).",

Individual cases of adult infection have been reported in the literature (Murase and Akiyama, 2018, Stewart et al., 2013). The Coxsackievirus A6 (CVA6) serotype has been linked to several HFMD outbreaks worldwide, affecting both adults and children (Kimmis et al., 2018, Ramirez-Fort et al., 2014). HFMD due to CVA6 differs in presentation from classic HFMD. Unlike in typical HFMD, adults with CVA6 HFMD are more likely to develop vesicular eruptions involving the dorsal hands and feet, as well as the face (Horsten et al., 2018). The lesions may also appear more purpuric than typical HFMD and can mimic secondary syphilis. Later in the disease process, the rash can desquamate and mimic fungal infection (Ramirez-Fort et al., 2014). Other features include widespread vesiculobullous and erosive lesions extending beyond the palms and soles, an eczema herpeticum-like eruption termed \u201ceczema coxsackium\u201d, and an eruption similar to Gianotti-Crosti in children (Mathes et al., 2013). There can also be occasional sparing of the oral mucosa (Second et al., 2017). Outbreaks of HFMD in adults that have been reported in the literature have typically occurred in adults following exposure to children with HFMD (CDC MMWR, 2012) or among college students (Buttery et al., 2015) and military trainees (Banta et al., 2016).",

One retrospective cohort analysis of 55 pregnant women with measles in Namibia showed increased risks for low birth weight, spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal death, and maternal death when compared with pregnancies without measles (Ogbuanu et al., 2014). In this study, 71% of the women developed measles-related complications, including diarrhea (60%), pneumonia (40%), and encephalitis (5%). Of the pregnancies with known outcomes, 60% had at least one adverse outcome, including maternal death in 12% of cases. Other studies comparing women with and without measles during pregnancy have shown increased frequency of prematurity, increased likelihood of neonatal intensive care unit admission, and longer intensive care unit stays among neonates born to mothers with gestational measles (Siegel and Fuerst, 1966; Ali and Albar, 1997). The rate of congenital defects does not appear to be higher among neonates born to mothers with measles than to uninfected mothers (Siegel, 1973; Ali and Albar, 1997). However, congenital measles can occur, with the severity ranging from mild to fatal (Gershon 2006). Congenital measles has been reported among neonates born to women who had measles within 10 days of delivery (Charlier et al., 2015). Measles is highly contagious, with up to 90% of susceptible individuals becoming infected upon exposure (McLean et al., 2013).

Primary HSV infection during pregnancy may rarely lead to life-threatening disseminated disease (Young et al., 1996; Sappenfield et al., 2013), but the greatest risk is vertical transmission. Intrauterine infection is rare, but its occurrence is associated with severe neurological, ophthalmologic, and cutaneous manifestations, as well as a high risk of intrauterine or postnatal death (Marquez et al., 2011). More commonly, transmission of HSV to the child is due to contact with virus shed from the genital or perianal region during labor and delivery. 50% to 80% of cases of neonatal HSV infection occur when genital HSV-1 or HSV-2 infection is acquired near term (Brown et al., 1997; Sullender et al., 1988). The risk is greatest when HSV is acquired within six weeks of delivery, when there is insufficient time for transplacental delivery of maternal antibodies (Brown et al., 1997). Transmission to the neonate is far less frequent among women who acquire genital herpes during early pregnancy or with histories of recurrent herpes, even if lesions are present at the time of delivery (Prober et al., 1987; Foley et al., 2014). Women with a history of HSV should be offered daily suppressive acyclovir or valacyclovir starting at 36 weeks\u2019 gestation to reduce the likelihood of clinical lesions and viral shedding at delivery (Money and Steben, 2017). Caesarean section is recommended for women with primary genital herpes during the third trimester and for women with histories of genital HSV and either active lesions or prodromal symptoms at the time of labor (Money and Steben, 2017; Foley et al., 2014). Pregnant women should take appropriate precautions to avoid acquiring genital HSV, especially during the third trimester.",

Varicella vaccine should be administered postpartum to nonimmune pregnant HCWs (Marin et al., 2007). Breastfeeding women may be vaccinated safely (Marin et al., 2007). Pregnant HCWs with no evidence of immunity, like all susceptible HCWs, should avoid contact with patients with confirmed or suspected varicella or herpes zoster (Siegel et al., 2007; Shefer et al., 2011; Chin et al., 2014, Kim et al., 2018). Immunized pregnant HCWs should follow airborne and contact precautions when caring for patients with varicella or disseminated herpes zoster; the same is true when caring for immunocompromised patients with localized zoster until disseminated infection has been ruled out. Because airborne transmission from immunocompetent patients with localized zoster is unlikely, it is sufficient for immunized HCWs to follow standard precautions and cover all lesions until dry and crusted. (Bolyard et al., 1998; Shefer et al., 2011).",

Susceptibility should be confirmed by serology prior to administration if possible. Careful monitoring for signs of infection despite passive immunization is essential. Nonimmune HCWs should be furloughed during days 8-28 after exposure (Shefer et al., 2011). If symptoms of varicella or disseminated zoster develop, HCWs should be placed on sick leave until all lesions have crusted over (Shefer et al., 2011; Chin et al., 2014, Kim et al., 2018). Fetal and maternal monitoring is crucial. Some experts recommend that pregnant women with uncomplicated varicella should receive oral acyclovir.

However, a large case series following 61 patients with gestational PR showed an association with adverse outcomes (Drago et al., 2008; Drago et al., 2014). The overall miscarriage rate among these cases was 13% but rose to 57% if PR developed during the first 15 weeks of gestation. The series suggested that viral reactivation of HHV-6 may have led to intrauterine transmission and subsequent fetal loss. Other unfavorable fetal outcomes reported included premature delivery and neonatal hypotonia. PR development before gestational week 15, the presence of enanthem, and high HHV-6 viral load were classified as major risk factors for poor outcomes. Constitutional symptoms and involvement of >50% of body surface area were considered minor risk factors (Drago et al., 2018). Atypical forms of PR may be associated with prolonged viral reactivation in the plasma and potential intrauterine transmission (Drago et al., 2016). The risk of maternal HHV-6 reactivation and intrauterine transmission has been described by others, but low rates of congenital infection (\u223c1%) were reported; furthermore, most congenital infections occurred due to chromosomal integration rather than transplacental infection (Caserta et al., 2007; Caserta et al., 2014).

In response to the overwhelming number of patients with the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) requiring hospitalization and ICU-level care, many medical providers who do not traditionally perform roles in these settings have been called to assist. The medical community\u2019s knowledge of COVID-19 continues to evolve rapidly. Information regarding any potential dermatologic manifestations of the disease, as well as the disease\u2019s impact on pregnancy, is limited as of April 2020. Pivotal data from patients in Wuhan, China have revealed that cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 are rare, with only 2% of over 1,000 patients having any type of documented rash (Guan et al., 2020). Both pregnant HCWs and patients have expressed concern regarding potential complications from COVID-19, although the disease appears to disproportionately affect men compared to women or the pediatric population. Two small retrospective analyses of pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia did not find evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission or elevated risk of neonatal or fetal complications (Chen et al., 2020; Schwartz 2020). Another cohort study of 17 pregnant patients, including three HCWs, also did not find conclusive evidence of vertical transmission (Khan et al., 2020). In a separate study of 13 pregnant patients with COVID-19, researchers did not find evidence of vertical transmission but did note that five patients required emergency cesarean section to avoid pregnancy-related complications (Liu et al., 2020). Although data on pregnant women from previous coronavirus pandemics are limited, it does not appear that pregnant women were more likely to acquire SARS-CoV-1 or MERS-CoV, other coronaviruses similar to SARS-CoV-2, which cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), respectively (Rasmussen et al., 2020). However, data from pregnant patients with SARS found that when pregnant women actually did acquire SARS-CoV-1, they tended to have more neonatal and maternal complications, including increased rates of ICU admission and mortality compared to non-pregnant patients (Lam et al. 2004; Wong et al., 2004).",

Pregnant HCWs should not provide any clinical care if they test positive for COVID-19. Any pregnant HCW who has symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 should self-isolate following testing for SARS-CoV-2 until results are available. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) recommends that female HCWs who are more than 28 weeks pregnant should avoid direct contact with all patients during the ongoing pandemic, even if the HCW is asymptomatic or has not had contact with known or suspected COVID-19 patients (Rimmer, 2020). Those who are less than 28 weeks pregnant, however, can continue to work in patient facing roles provided that they use proper personal protection equipment (PPE) (Rimmer, 2020). Some individual institutions have chosen to prohibit any pregnant HCW, whenever possible, from caring for patients with COVID-19. General principles regarding management of COVID-10 during pregnancy include early isolation, aggressive infection control procedures, testing for SARS-CoV-2 and coinfection, oxygen therapy as needed, avoidance of fluid overload, empiric antibiotics (due to secondary bacterial infection risk), fetal and uterine contraction monitoring, early mechanical ventilation for progressive respiratory failure, individualized delivery planning, and a team-based approach with multispecialty consultations (Rasmussen et al., 2020). Although breastfeeding is not currently contraindicated in patients with COVID-19, it is recommended that patients wear a face mask while breastfeeding to minimize risk of droplet transmission to the newborn (Dashraath et al., 2020). While SARS-CoV-2 has yet to be identified in breastmilk, newborns are still susceptible to transmission from contact with mothers or other family members, highlighting the importance of proper hand hygiene and social distancing measures.",

Large trials on outcomes in pregnant women, especially HCWs, are limited. As such, guidelines and recommendations for prevention for pregnant HCWs are limited. Here, we have reviewed and summarized recommendations from the literature. Further research is necessary to evaluate the impact of these measures on prevention. Recommendations should ensure adequate protection for HCWs while limiting unnecessary or cumbersome practices that would unnecessarily prevent pregnant HCWs from performing clinical duties. In addition, vaccination prior to pregnancy of preventable diseases, such as measles and varicella, is crucial. All clinicians should encourage women of childbearing potential to receive appropriate vaccinations prior to conceiving. Although the CDC provides vaccination recommendations for all HCWs (CDC MMWR, 2011), vaccination laws are typically determined by individual countries or, in the case of the United States, at the state level. The CDC\u2019s recommendations for the vaccination of HCWs are summarized in Table 3\n. Mandated vaccination requirements have been shown to be highly successful; for example, influenza vaccination rates in HCWs have significantly increased when healthcare institution-based mandates have been implemented in conjunction with government mandated vaccination requirements (Lin et al., 2016, Wang et al., 2017).
