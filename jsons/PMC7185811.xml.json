Exposure to bioaerosols may be associated with a wide range of adverse health effects to humans including allergies, lung impairments, asthma exacerbation, and infectious diseases [2], [3]. Recently, outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as \u201csevere acute respiratory syndrome\u201d (SARS) in 2003 and H1N1 influenza in 2009 have prompted global concerns about airborne biological exposure [4]. Bioaerosol exposure can occur in many different human working situations, including healthcare facilities, schools, office buildings, and restaurants [2]. Thus, it is of great importance to develop powerful bioaerosol control technologies to eliminate adverse health effects of bioaerosols to human.",

            "text": "Over the years, many studies have been conducted to develop bioaerosol control technologies [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. The technologies can be categorized into two main methods: adsorption and disinfection methods. In the adsorption method, filters, such as high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter, or adsorbent materials such as carbon nanotubes (CNT) or activated carbon can effectively trap microorganisms to eliminate them from the air stream [5], [6]. However, the trapped or adsorbed microorganisms are not inactivated and thus could reproduce under certain suitable conditions [11]. In the disinfection methods, typically UV irradiation and UV-induced photocatalysis (e.g., TiO2) are used to decompose organics leading to the death of the microorganism [7], [8], [12]. However, high-energy consumption and safety issues are the main problems concerning the use of UV irradiation. To overcome the disadvantages of using UV as excitation source, numerous strategies have been carried out to improve the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 as an effective photocatalyst under visible light irradiation [13], [14], [15], [16]. Among these strategies, metals or non-metals as doping agents to enhance the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 have been frequently used [17], [18], [19], [20], [21]. In our previous studies, we used Ag as a doping and sensitization to enhance the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 deposited on glass fiber [22], [23], [24]. The synthesized photocatalysts exhibited high photocatalytic disinfection activity in removing Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus (Staph) in bioaerosols under visible light. However, the glass fiber used as the substrate for the deposition of the enhanced TiO2 has a low surface area and low adsorption ability. Thus, the photocatalytic activity of the enhanced TiO2 was not maximally exhibited. Thus, a more suitable substrate, with properties such as higher adsorption capacity, strong adherence with the enhanced TiO2, non-degradation, and oxidative resistance during the photocatalytic process, is needed to replace the glass fiber substrate for the deposition of the enhanced TiO2.",

These results indicated that TiO2 was formed on the PU surface. In the FTIR spectra of the TiO2/PU and Ag\u2013TiO2/PU, the adsorption peaks of Si\u2013O\u2013Si, corresponding to the occurrence of SiO2 on the surface of the PU, were also observed.

These peaks indicated that the silanization process of titania to produce titanosiloxane occurred successfully based on the reaction between tetra isopropyl ortho titanate and \u03b3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane (reaction 1). Compared with the FTIR result of the activated PU, the FTIR peaks of TiO2/PU and Ag\u2013TiO2/PU showed strong increases in the N\u2013H and CO adsorption peaks, which are typical peaks of the urea group (\u2013NH\u2013CO\u2013NH\u2013) [36]. Additionally, the isocyanate peaks in the TiO2/PU and Ag\u2013TiO2/PU greatly decreased, compared with the activated PU. This indicates that urea linkage was formed successfully based on the reaction between the isocyanate groups in the activated PU and the amine groups of the titanosiloxane (reaction (2)). Thus, TiO2 was deposited successfully on the surface of PU in both TiO2/PU and Ag\u2013TiO2/PU based on bridge role of silicone, which bonds TiO2 and PU by a C\u2013Si\u2013O\u2013Ti link.",

The spectrum analysis indicated that the states of the Ag in Ag\u2013TiO2/PU were Ag0 and Ag+. The peaks observed at 374.1 and 368.1 eV are characteristic peaks of Ag metallic (Ag0) [37]. The formation of Ag0 could be due to photo-reduction and thermal decomposition of AgNO3 during the irradiation and calcination processes [17], [22]. The peaks observed at 373.3 and 367.3 eV are characteristic peaks of Ag+\n[38]. Atla et al. reported that Ag+ ions, which were adsorbed on TiO2 surface, could be anchored to the external-surface of TiO2 by Ti\u2013O\u2013Ag bonds via photo-deposition processes [17], [39]. Because the peak intensity and peak area of Ag0 peaks were much higher than those of Ag+ peaks, the concentration of Ag0 in Ag\u2013TiO2/PU was much higher than that of Ag+ (Fig. 5).",

Based on the Gaussian multi-peak shapes, the Si 2p peaks of silicon in TiO2/PU consisted of three different peaks, at 103.8, 102.7 and 101.9 eV, which were attributed to the binding energy of Si 2p in Si\u2013O\u2013Si, Si\u2013O\u2013Ti, and C\u2013Si\u2013O bonds, respectively [40], [41]. The peak of Si\u2013O\u2013Si bond was identified by the occurrence of SiO2 layer in TiO2/PU. The occurrence of Si\u2013O\u2013Ti and C\u2013Si\u2013O peaks confirmed the conclusion, from the FTIR analysis, that silicon acted as bridge element to bond TiO2 with the polyurethane substrate. Thus, the surface chemical composition of TiO2/PU could contain three main layers: a TiO2 layer, a SiO2 layer, and the PU substrate. The TiO2 layer could bond to PU substrate by C\u2013Si\u2013O\u2013Ti links (Fig. 7\n). The Si 2p peaks of silicon in Ag\u2013TiO2/PU also consisted of three different peaks \u2013 at 103.7, 102.4, and 101.9 eV \u2013 which were attributed to the binding energy of Si 2p in Si\u2013O\u2013Si, Si\u2013O\u2013Ti, and C\u2013Si\u2013O bonds, respectively. The peak position of the C\u2013Si\u2013O bond was still at 101.9 eV. However, the peak positions of Si\u2013O\u2013Si and Si\u2013O\u2013Ti bonds shifted 0.1 and 0.3 (eV) into the lower binding energy region, respectively (Fig. 6). These peak shifts could be due to Ag particles deposited on the surface of the TiO2 layer [22]. The electron clouds of silicon in Si\u2013O\u2013Si and Si\u2013O\u2013Ti bonds could be stretched due to plasmon resonance of Ag particles, leading to the shift of their typical peaks into the lower binding energy region. On other hand, the plasmon resonance of Ag may not be strong enough to stretch the electron cloud of silicon in the C\u2013Si\u2013O bond because the Ag particles are too far from the bond (Fig. 7).",

As compared with TiO2/PU and Ag\u2013TiO2/PU, PU did not exhibit noticeable light absorption ability in the visible range. The TiO2/PU seems to have inherited the light absorption properties of TiO2, with the absorption edge around 370 nm [43]. Compared with TiO2/PU, the Ag\u2013TiO2/PU exhibited a red shift of the absorption edge. In the visible region (400\u2013700 nm), the light adsorption ability of Ag\u2013TiO2/PU was also much higher than that of TiO2/PU. The result is explained by light absorption characteristic of the Ag particles, which were deposited on the TiO2 surface [18], [39]. The plasmon resonance of Ag could excite electrons to move out of the valence band of TiO2. Thus, the electrons in the valence band of TiO2 could be readily generated under certain excitation conditions, leading to the red shift of the absorption edge of the Ag\u2013TiO2/PU. Ag could act as an intermediate agent to transfer excited electrons from the valence band to the conduction band of TiO2\n[43]. Additionally, Ag particles could also act as electron sinks to prevent the recombination of the excited electrons in the conduction band and holes in the valence band of TiO2\n[22]. Therefore, the visible light absorption of the Ag\u2013TiO2/PU was significantly improved by the Ag particles. Because Ag\u2013TiO2/PU is easily excited by visible light and prevented from recombination of the electrons and holes, the photocatalytic activity is expected to increase even under visible-light irradiation.",

Under dark conditions, E. coli removal could be mainly attributed to the adsorption abilities of the PU, TiO2/PU, and Ag\u2013TiO2/PU adsorbents. The PU, TiO2/PU, and Ag\u2013TiO2/PU could act as adsorbents, leading to removal of E. coli from the aerosol. Such adsorption is based on interactions between the cells and the adsorbent surface including van der Waals forces, electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions [44]. These interactions depend greatly on the characteristics of the adsorbent surface, such as pore structure, surface area, roughness, surface charge, chemical structure, and hydrophobicity [44], [45]. It is clear that the maximum E. coli removal capacity by the PU, TiO2/PU, and Ag\u2013TiO2/PU were positively related to the specific surface area of the adsorbents. The identified specific surface areas of PU, TiO2/PU, and Ag\u2013TiO2/PU were 30.46, 110.93, and 186.56 m2/g, respectively. These results indicate that specific surface area would be a major factor contributing to the adsorption capacity of bacteria by the synthesized materials. However, the bacterial adsorption capacities were not exactly in proportion with the specific surface area of adsorbents, because of differences in the surface properties of the different adsorbents. Different surface properties of the adsorbents, such as the hydrophobicity of the PU, positive charged surface of the TiO2/PU and Ag\u2013TiO2/PU, and the surface roughness of the Ag\u2013TiO2/PU can lead to different interactions between bacterial cells and adsorbent surface, resulting in different bacterial adsorption capacities by different adsorbents. Tijing al el. reported that PU was a hydrophobic material [46]. Thus, a hydrophobic interaction between PU and bacteria could also contribute to the bacterial adsorption capacity of PU [47]. Several previous studies have reported that materials containing metal, TiO2, and SiO2 on the surface could have numerous positive charges on their surface [44], [46]. Thus, the electrostatic interactions between the negative charges on the cell wall of E. coli and the positive charges on the surface of TiO2/PU or Ag\u2013TiO2/PU could also contribute to the bacterial adsorption capacity of the adsorbents. In addition, the surface roughness of an adsorbent could promote bacterial adhesion, and thus the surface roughness of Ag\u2013TiO2/PU (Fig.  8C) could be another factor contributing to the increase in E. coli adsorption capacity of the material [48].",

The maximum E. coli removal capacity by PU and TiO2/PU under visible light condition did not exhibit any significant increase as compared with those under dark conditions. These results indicated that the PU and TiO2/PU exhibited only or almost only an adsorption capability to remove E. coli from the aerosol under visible light conditions. Because PU is non-photocatalytic and an inert material in visible light, it exhibits only adsorption properties to remove E. coli from the aerosol under visible light. Although TiO2/PU does inherit the photocatalytic properties of TiO2, the band gap energy of TiO2 is approximately 3.2 eV, which requires irradiation with a wavelength shorter than 388 nm to excite electrons for photocatalytic processes. Thus, visible light, which has wavelengths in range from 400 to 700 nm is not a sufficiently energetic light source to allow photocatalytic processes of TiO2. Thus, the visible light irradiation showed no noticeable effect on the E. coli removal capacity beyond its adsorption removal capacity for TiO2/PU.",

This increase could be due to the role of the Ag dopant that could enhance the photocatalytic activity of the TiO2. As explained in Section 3.1.4, the Ag dopant could enhance electron\u2013hole separation efficiency and separation capacity of TiO2. When the Ag\u2013TiO2/PU was irradiated even by visible light, the electron-hole pairs could be generated easily. Then, the photo-generated electron-hole pairs of Ag\u2013TiO2/PU could react with water and molecular oxygen adsorbed on the material surface, leading to the formation of oxy radicals, such as hydroxyl radicals (.OH) and superoxide radical anions (.O2\n\u2212), which are highly reactive. The generated oxy radicals could cause destruction of the outer cell wall and unsaturated phospholipids in the cell membrane of the bacteria, leading to significant disorder in cell permeability and decomposition of the cell walls, resulting in bacterial death [49]. Chen et al. reported that the oxy radicals could also oxidize intracellular coenzyme A (CoA), leading to inhibiting cell respiration and subsequently causing the death of the bacteria [8]. The generated oxy radicals could also decompose the nucleic acids, and affect the replication of DNA and many cellular functions, resulting in bacterial death [50]. Thus, the Ag\u2013TiO2/PU could exhibit photocatalytic activity even under visible light to generate highly oxidative radicals, which could participate in oxidation processes to decompose important organic components of bacteria, resulting in death or removal of the bacteria from the aerosol [22].",

Thus, this study identified that the Ag\u2013TiO2/PU showed greatly improved photocatalytic activity even under visible light to produce oxy radicals, which could decompose vital organic components of bacteria, leading to death or removal of bacterial from the aerosol. Thus, Ag\u2013TiO2/PU could be used effectively and economically for both adsorption and photo-oxidation removal of E. coli from an aerosol even under visible light irradiation.",
