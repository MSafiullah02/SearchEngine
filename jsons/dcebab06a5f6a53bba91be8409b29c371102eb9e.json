They also defined, on such hypergraphs, a normalized Laplace operator that generalizes the one introduced by Chung for graphs [2] and they investigated some properties of its spectrum. Furthermore, in a recent work [3] , the author together with Christian Kuehn and J\u00fcrgen Jost proposed an application of this theory to the study of dynamical systems on hypergraphs.",

Here we generalize (1) and (2) to the case of hypergraphs. The results presented here hold, in particular, for oriented hypergraphs, that is, chemical hypergraphs that do not include catalysts. Oriented hypergraphs have been introduced in [4] by Reff and Rusnak, who also introduced the non-normalized Laplacian and the adjacency matrix for such hypergraphs. The spectral properties of these operators have been widely investigated, see for instance [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] .",

Note that (8) tells us that, for graphs, we can characterize Q by looking at the characterization of \u03bb N in (3) and then replacing the L 2 -norm by the L 1 -norm both in the numerator and denominator. The reason why this is interesting is that something analogous happens to the classical graph Cheeger constant h. It is in fact well known that, for connected graphs, h bounds the first nonzero eigenvalue 2 \u03bb 2 both above and below and it can be characterized by first looking at a characterization of \u03bb 2 using the Rayleigh quotient and then replacing the L 2 -norm by the L 1 -norm both in the numerator and denominator [2] . Furthermore, the first Cheeger-like constant for the largest graph eigenvalue that has been introduced is the dual Cheeger constanth [15, 16] . What makes the two Cheeger-like constants conceptually different is the fact thath is related to the Cheeger-constant h [15] and it doesn't have a characterization analogous to the one of Q, in terms of the Rayleigh quotient.",
