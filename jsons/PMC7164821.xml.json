Underestimation of the number of community cases leads to overestimates of severity.12, 13 Heightened concern during a pandemic can change patient consultation thresholds and clinician recording and investigation behaviour, thus distorting surveillance information.14 Information on the community burden of influenza is key to informing control,15 but is not routinely collected. For example, influenza transmission models, which are widely used to consider the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of vaccines, antivirals, and non-pharmaceutical countermeasures, depend on valid epidemiological estimates of the community occurrence of disease. The available data for periods of seasonal influenza are largely derived historically from household cohort studies of families with children in communities in the USA between 1948 and 1981,16, 17, 18, 19 and a more recent study from rural Vietnam.20 There have also been some cohort studies reporting on the 2009 pandemic from Hong Kong, southeast Asia, and Mali21, 22, 23, 24, 25 as well as several cross-sectional serosurveys from this period.26 Case-ascertained household transmission studies can estimate the secondary attack proportion and effects of interventions within households; however, they are not designed to estimate community burden of influenza infection and disease.27, 28 The Flu Watch study is the first national community cohort study of influenza occurrence enrolling households with and without children, with the additional benefit of modern molecular diagnostic techniques.",

PCR-confirmation levels seemed to be lower in adults aged 65 years or older (9%, 95% CI 1\u201360) and for influenza B infections (5%, 1\u201328), although this was not statistically significant.",

For example, better measures of community disease burden will increase the validity of population models that are widely used to infer the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of countermeasures such as use of antivirals, vaccines, and behavioural interventions. On average influenza infected 18% of unvaccinated people each winter. Up to three-quarters of infections were asymptomatic and about a quarter of infections had PCR-confirmed disease. 17% of people with PCR-confirmed disease had medically attended illness. These data did not vary significantly when comparing pandemic with seasonal influenza. People infected with the 2009 pandemic strain had markedly less severe symptoms than those infected with seasonal H3N2.PanelResearch in context\nSystematic review\nWe searched published work to address four key questions relevant to our study: what proportion of the population have influenza infection each influenza season, what proportion of infections lead to illness, what are the symptom profiles and severity of these illnesses, and what proportion of these illnesses lead to consultation? We reviewed historical community cohort studies of respiratory infections such as the Tecumseh study,18 the methods of which were adapted for the Flu Watch study. These studies are summarised elsewhere.19 We also reviewed findings from more recent cohort studies using similar designs.20, 21, 22, 23 We then did three separate systematic literature searches in Embase, Global Health, and Medline databases (up to Aug 13, 2013) to identify community-level cohort studies of influenza with PCR or serological confirmation (search terms in appendix).To identify work relevant to establishing population-level influenza infection rates, we reviewed a recent review and meta-analysis of age-specific cumulative incidence for the 2009 influenza pandemic.26 We also searched published work for community-level cohort studies of influenza that collected paired sera (search terms in appendix). Studies were included in this review if they were community-level cohorts but excluded if they only focused on subsections of the population.To add to the work identified above, we did a further two systematic literature searches in the same databases to identify relevant community-level prospective cohort studies that had PCR confirmation of influenza illnesses (search terms in appendix). Studies were included if they were community-level cohorts with prospective follow-up of respiratory illnesses with swabbing for PCR confirmation of influenza. Studies were excluded if they only focused on subsections of the population or if they only did PCRs on a subset of illnesses (ie, only consulting illnesses or only those meeting a case definition which would exclude less severe influenza).\nInterpretation\nOur rates of infection and disease were similar to those found in historical cohort studies and in more recent, mostly pandemic, studies.18, 19, 20 Our finding that a high proportion of infections were asymptomatic was consistent with other research.35 Influenza A H3N2 has previously been reported as causing more severe symptoms than Influenza A H1N1.35 Others have also reported that a high proportion of people with influenza-like illness do not seek medical attention.14\n",

Weighted analyses ensured results represented the age and regional structure of the country. Weighted analyses of overall population rates of infection (but not illness or disease) assume the level of infection recorded in children younger than five years were similar to those in those aged 5\u201316 years. However, because children younger than 5 years represent only about 6% of the UK population the lack of serological analysis in this group will not have made a major difference to overall reported rates.

Participants were generally highly diligent at completing weekly illness reports and submitting nasal swabs during illness (>85% completion). That the proportion of infections judged symptomatic was very similar using two independent methods (proportion of seroconverters PCR-confirmed and attributable-rate of respiratory illness in seroconverters compared with non-seroconverters)35 suggests that the low proportion with PCR-confirmed disease is not simply a matter of low test sensitivity. Nasal swabs have similar sensitivity to the gold-standard nasopharyngeal aspirates.37, 38 Self-taken swabs have similar sensitivity to those taken by health-care workers.39 The extent of postal delay is not associated with likelihood of PCR positivity for influenza.40 After adjusting for time from symptom onset to swab date, a recent comparison showed similar levels of viral detection and viral load in primary-care samples from patients with influenza-like illness to those in postally submitted samples from patients consulting the National Pandemic Flu Service.41 Because of the high level of completion of weekly illness status reports, adjusting our attributable rates for the recorded level of under-reporting made minimal difference to our conclusions on the proportion of infections leading to illness. The attributable-rate method might underestimate the proportion of infections leading to illness if having influenza reduces the risk of other respiratory infections through viral interference,42 but we did not identify any evidence of this in our data.",

Surveillance does not aim to capture the totality of community cases, but low ascertainment means that changes in consultation and reporting behaviour during periods of increased concern can make interpretation of trends highly problematic. It is also likely that propensity to consult if ill might vary by country, making international comparisons difficult. Our findings show this during the summer wave of the pandemic, where comparison of disease rates with national surveillance suggest a much higher proportion of cases were identified with surveillance than at other times. This greater identification probably represents an increase in propensity for people to consult and be reported during periods of increased national concern; however, because only two confirmed cases were identified in the study during this summer period we cannot test this directly. From a population perspective there was little difference in burden of disease in the 2009 pandemic compared with seasonal influenza periods. Both seasonal and pandemic infections were common, especially in children, but most infection was asymptomatic and most symptomatic cases did not consult. The symptoms associated with 2009 pandemic influenza were substantially milder than those of seasonal H3N2. The completeness of return of weekly illness status reports did not alter during the pandemic, suggesting that change in reporting to the study was not a source of bias (appendix). Hospitalisation and death rates were very low with insufficient events to establish if this varied by strain type.",

This upwards age shift is probably explained by the fact that before this third wave, protective antibody titres were present in about three-quarters of children, but only about a third of working-age adults. However, it remains unclear why young adults were not more affected during earlier waves. The higher numbers of deaths and admissions noted nationally during the pandemic third wave were therefore probably due to increased numbers of cases in young adults rather than, as reported by others, increased severity.44 The occurrence of a third wave in the pandemic reinforces the value of investing in vaccine development even if vaccines are unlikely to be available sufficiently early to alter the course of early waves.",

Our finding that only 23% (95% CI 13\u201334) of infections are symptomatic is lower than is sometimes assumed, but is consistent with findings from other studies of seasonal influenza35 and human challenge studies.45 Measurement of the proportion of serologically confirmed infections that are asymptomatic should be an early priority for any emerging infection of pandemic potential. This provides an additional index of severity complementing population level data on admission to hospital and deaths. Our study was limited by our inability to identify virus shedding during asymptomatic infection because this would have needed frequent regular nasal swabbing throughout follow-up. Comparison of symptom profiles in community cases of an emerging infection with those noted with other viruses can also provide important information on severity, complementing population level data on numbers of admissions to hospital and deaths.",

Although A(H1N1)pdm09 infected most children and a high proportion of unvaccinated adults of all ages over three pandemic waves, infection and disease rates were similar to or lower than prepandemic periods. Symptoms due to infection with the 2009 pandemic strain were milder than those with seasonal influenza strains. Our findings are consistent with the very low case-fatality rates recorded during the pandemic. Whereas overall, pandemic illnesses were mild there was a shift in the age distribution of deaths leading to an increase in years of life lost during the 2009 pandemic compared with some seasonal periods.7 Despite its mild nature, the 2009 pandemic caused enormous international concern, expense, and disruption. We need to prepare for how to respond to both mild and severe pandemics. To do this we need more refined assessments of severity, including community studies to guide control measures early in the course of a pandemic and inform a proportionate response.",
