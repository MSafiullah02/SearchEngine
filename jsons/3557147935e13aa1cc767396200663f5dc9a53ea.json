American presidential candidates are currently debating whether US hospitals could successfully adapt if Medicare payment amounts applied to all patients. Prior research documents structural and operational sources of efficiency in modern Indian hospitals. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] Parsing inter-country cost differences to identify sources of cost advantage transferable to US hospitals requires accounting for the actual costs of a well-specified treatment meeting a common quality standard. 8, 9 Prevailing healthcare cost accounting systems use imprecise methods to measure the costs of treatment. 10 Other industries, such as financial services and retailing, use time-driven activity-based costing (TDABC) to measure the costs of their services more accurately. Until recently, TDABC has rarely been applied in healthcare. [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] To explore the transferability of modern Indian hospitals' cost advantages to US hospitals, we apply TDABC to support a case study of three hospitals with reputations for effective use of modern performance management methods.",

Financial challenges of the post-COVID-19 environment may encourage US hospitals to conduct more precise cost comparisons to revisit current standard operating procedures governing the use of personnel across the cardiovascular service line. Similar comparisons across hospitals have led to important improvements in clinical quality. 29, 30 Our study is subject to limitations beyond the inherent non-generalizability of case studies. We do not compare costs other than direct costs for personnel and space. Overhead costs are likely to be much higher in the US due to costs imposed by complexities of the US payment, regulatory and external reporting environment. Since the study examines CABG surgeries without complications, findings are not generalizable to CABG procedures resulting in complications or other hospital-based care.

Harvesting cost advantages from such concentration partly depends on extending elective surgical starts to early evenings and weekends rather than building new hospital capacity .

            "text": "Patients at NH spend two days on average in a low-cost pre-operative hospital unit. The resulting pool of pre-operative patients assures that last-minute surgical cancellations do not waste time of costly clinicians and ORs. NH also controls space costs with a simple, open hospital design and shared patient rooms.The site visit team at NH observed multiple illustrations of personnel downshifting geared to continuous assessment of peri-operative risk. For example, NH replaces a senior perfusionist with a student perfusionist during its off-pump CABG surgeries, which comprise 75% of NH CABG surgeries. Senior and junior perfusionists overseeing ORs rapidly replace student perfusionists if an off-pump case converts to on-pump case or if other unexpected highrisk events occur. Similarly, a senior anesthesiologist simultaneously monitors operations performed in five glass-windowed operating rooms by standing at the corner of a corridor and intervening quickly if perceived risk of complications rises.The site visit team observed that NH's use of detailed protocols for clinical tasks facilitates task downshifting by assigning narrowly-scoped tasks to less skilled personnel. NH's continuous patient risk stratification, detailed care protocols, and narrowed task assignments for lower-cost personnel illustrate the application of systems engineering tools, long encouraged by Academy of Medicine26 and the President's Council of Advisors on Science andTechnology.27 Counter-balancing the transferability of a lower skill mix are valid US hospital and clinician concerns about the more litigious US medical malpractice liability environment.India's more permissive hospital and professional licensing regulations facilitate NH's extensive task downshifting. After post--operative transfer to a floor bed, Indian regulations allow NH to delegate non-professional hospital tasks, such as observation of stable patients, bed linen maintenance, and feeding to patients' family members under nurse supervision. NH nurses feel such delegation builds family members' confidence and competence to care for patients after discharge. Patients and their families spend approximately 1200 minutes during the hospital stay being trained by physical therapists, dieticians, and diabetes educators. This is almost three times longer than such interactions at the two US hospitals. Greater engagement of families during post-surgical inpatient convalescence may explain why NH is able to discharge almost all patients directly home and experience a negligible rate of readmissions within 30 days of hospital discharge. Very low post-hospital use of post-acute facilities and professionals",

Most are likely unaware of secondary effects such as lower wage and job growth for workers in industries other than healthcare.31 To offset inertia, CMS and private sector purchasers of healthcare are encouraging physicians and hospital leaders to deliver the same or better care at lower cost through bundled payment and other forms of value-based purchasing. As public debate continues over whether US hospitals could adapt to a Medicare for All environment,32 estimates of its impact on hospital financial viability should include consideration of potentially transferable opportunities to improve American hospital efficiency such as those illuminated by this case study.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS:The study was supported by the Sue and Dick Levy Fund, an advised fund of the Silicon Valley Community Foundation.
