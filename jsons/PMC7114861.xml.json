Level of HA-MRSA infection rate was significantly decreased after intervention in total patients, and trend of infection rate was also changed after intervention. These findings suggested that pre-emptive contact precaution had beneficial effects on HA-MRSA infection rate. Analysis in total patients indicated that intubation was significantly associated with the increase in HA-MRSA infection. Segmented Poisson regression analysis showed that neither the level nor trend changed after intervention in non-intubated patients, whereas both the level and trend changed in intubated patients.

However, HA-MRSA transmission occurred in >20% of intubated patients in 2004, and about half of them developed HA-MRSA infection. Analysis of our surveillance data in 2004 revealed that intubated patients had an eight-fold higher risk of acquiring MRSA than did non-intubated patients. We considered this to be because the ICU staff administered more frequent intensive care such as tracheal aspiration and body position changes to intubated than to non-intubated patients, thus increasing the chance of MRSA transmission by medical staff or equipment to intubated patients. On the basis of this analysis, we hypothesised that the use of extensive (pre-emptive) contact precautions for all intubated patients could prevent HA-MRSA transmission and infection.",

Nevertheless, HA-MRSA transmission in intubated patients decreased in the 2nd period. HA-MRSA infection also significantly decreased in the 2nd period in both the intubated patients and in total ICU patients. These results indicate that pre-emptive contact precautions for all intubated patients helped to reduce HA-MRSA in intubated patients, which consequently prevented spreading and developing MRSA infection in all of the ICU patients. The percentage of patients who developed HA-MRSA decreased from 52.6% in the 1st period to 36.6% in the 2nd period. The percentage of patients who developed HA-MRSA infection decreased from 52.6% in the 1st period to 36.6% in the 2nd period. The detailed mechanism of this reduction was not clarified in this study. However, we noticed that transmission of MRSA to intubated patients was delayed slightly during the 2nd period, which might affect developing HA-MRSA infection.",

Yap et al. reported their intervention during outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, which comprised gloves and gowns used all the time when medical staff worked in their ICU.10 They showed an increase in the MRSA isolation rate in spite of their infection control policy, and considered that low compliance to the policy was the main reason for the adverse result. Their result suggested that it was important to formulate practicable infection control policy according to the individual healthcare setting. In the present study, we introduced the contact precaution only for the intubated patients based on our surveillance data and explained its significance to our ICU staff through the 2nd period, which we think may have made our intervention more successful. In Bearman et al.\u2019s study, efficacy of universal gloving was compared to standard and contact precaution of CDC guidelines.11, 12 The acquisition rate of MDRO was not different between the two phases (phase 1: standard and contact precaution; phase 2: universal gloving). They suspected that low compliance with hand hygiene might affect the transmission of MDRO, and that the short follow-up period was insufficient to reveal a statistically significant difference in HAI rate. We introduced pre-emptive contact precautions with gloves and apron for the intubated patients and followed its effect for three years. Although the compliance with apron and glove was not evaluated, we think the targeted precaution derived from local surveillance data could improve HAI control. Slaughter et al. reported the efficacy of universal use of gloves and gowns in comparison with that of glove use alone on acquisition of VRE in a medical ICU.13 In comparison with our study, the percentage of patients with VRE positive on admission was higher, and the number of patients included was smaller in their study. Barrier precaution bypass and contamination of equipment were also noted in their study, which could affect healthcare-associated transmission of VRE. Our study was not designed to determine the effect of apron and gloves in comparison with gloves alone, so further investigation is needed to clarify the effect of universal use of gloves together with gown or apron to prevent HAI.",

            "text": "In the 2nd period, more than 40% of the patients were intubated, so the number of targeted patients for pre-emptive contact precautions was high, which indicated higher cost for infection control. In regard to the efficacy of preventing MRSA transmission in the ICU, routine MRSA surveillance and infection control protocol are reported to result in marked reduction in the incidence of MRSA bacteraemia in ICU, non-ICU and hospital-wide.14 Because patients admitted to the ICU usually transfer out of the ICU when they no longer require critical care, target precautions to prevent MRSA transmission in the high risk unit could prevent a large number of MRSA infections not only in the ICU but also throughout the entire institution. In our calculation, the cost for infection control (gloves and aprons) on each patient-day was $12.0, which was $3.8 higher than the cost in the 1st period. The cost of antibiotics used to treat MRSA infection was reduced by $0.9 per patient-day in the 2nd period. Therefore, the total increase in cost was $2.9 per patient-day in the 2nd period. However, the attributable cost for a longer stay in ICU or evaluation and treatment of infection other than antibiotics was not taken into account in this calculation; we speculate that the cost reduction in the 2nd period would be much greater in the real clinical setting. Regarding the cost for infection control, the additional cost for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) was reported to be $10,019 per case, which included the cost for evaluation such as chest radiography, arterial blood gases and blood cultures, and the cost for administered antibiotics.15 Puzniak et al. performed a cost-benefit analysis of gown use in controlling VRE transmission: the annual net benefit of the gown policy was $419,346, and the cost-saving per case of averted VRE was $1,897.16 They concluded that infection control policies initially increase the cost of health service delivery, but that such policies can result in overall cost savings by averting HAIs and the costs of treatment. Considering the adverse effect and outcome of MRSA infection in critically ill patients, we also think that the cost for gloves and aprons to prevent MRSA transmission is well worth the price in this high risk care area.",

It is also possible that our ICU staff were more susceptible to MRSA transmission or infection during the 2nd period, as a result of the so-called Hawthorne effect. The differences in patient characteristics between the two periods such as age, percentage of intubated patients within 24 h of admission and the rate of MRSA-positive patients on admission might also have affected the results. Second, we did not present the infection rates by device days in urinary tract infection, central venous line-associated infection and VAP. Although total HAI rate per 1000 patient-days was significantly lower in the 2nd period, the incidence of each infection was too low to show a significant decrease in the 2nd period. Further study is required to determine the effect of pre-emptive contact precaution on each HAI. Third, our study was focused on critically ill patients in the ICU, so our strategy may not be applied directly to other institutions such as non-acute care facilities. As the CDC guidelines recommend, setting a flexible and individual strategy for each facility based on the local surveillance or risk assessment data is necessary to perform cost-effective infection control, and we suppose that educating and feeding these data back to the local medical staff may contribute to the promotion of more rigorous infection control.",
