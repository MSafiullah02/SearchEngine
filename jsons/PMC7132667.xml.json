Among the hospital toilets, 1 was dedicated to health care personnel and the other 4 were adjacent to patient rooms (3 from 2-bed rooms and 1 from a 4-bed room). For each toilet, at least 5 replicate sampling campaigns were conducted. In each campaign, 2 sets of samples were collected: 1 before and 1 after the application of a cleaning procedure. In each toilet and for each set of samples, 1 aerosol and 4 surface samples were collected. The surfaces were chosen to reflect the potential for hand contamination: the toilet seat and its cover, the flushing handle/button, and the internal door handle. In addition to air and surfaces, the water inside each toilet was also sampled as the possible source of the environment contamination. In total, 172 surfaces (108 and 64 for hospital and offices, respectively), 43 air (27 and 16 for hospital and offices, respectively), and 19 water (4 and 15 for hospital and offices, respectively) samples were collected.",

A possible explanation of this observation can be the different epidemiologic diffusion of these agents. In fact, both HAdV and TTV are normally eliminated by feces even in the absence of clinical disease and are very common in the population, as demonstrated by sewage monitoring,23 whereas the circulation of the other viruses we searched is more limited, more often linked to clinical cases, and dependent on alternative mechanisms of transmission based on the oral\u2013fecal route. During virologic monitoring, an epidemiologic surveillance of symptomatic infections, based on the observation of fever and diarrhea, did not show evident cases of simultaneous presence of target viruses in environment and patients samples (data not shown).",

This poses a problem particularly when virologic monitoring is used to verify the efficacy of disinfection procedures. Studies on HAdV survival in comparison with DNA persistence following chemical disinfection9 showed a difference of 1 log due to PCR detection of DNA originating from inactive virus. Moreover, when comparing the results of the virologic analysis of surfaces before and after disinfection, the HAdV positivity and titers seem to increase even if not significantly, whereas the values of TVBC decrease, mainly in the hospital. The reason for this contradiction seems to be the interference of dirtiness on PCR enzymes, as demonstrated by our experiments on artificially contaminated surfaces, as well as previous studies.27 Thus, before using molecular assays to verify the efficiency of disinfection measures, the sensitivity of analytical tests should be carefully evaluated in the presence of different concentrations of organic substances. From these data, we can conclude that molecular data on surfaces before disinfection are affected by underestimation due to interference by organic substances on PCR and data obtained after disinfection are affected by overestimation due to the detection of noninfective DNA. Thus, the validity of TVBC abatement for predicting virus removal should be assessed through further investigation.",
