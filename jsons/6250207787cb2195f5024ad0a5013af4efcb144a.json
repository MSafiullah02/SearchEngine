The latest research demonstrated that blood glucose was a representative indicator of multi-organ injury and earlier predictor for poor outcomes and death in COVID-19 patients [3] . Besides diabetes patients, severe cases of COVID-19 who received corticosteroid treatment were also faced with glucose challenges. According to the therapeutic experience of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, timely glucose monitoring and control may improve the prognosis of diabetes patients with coronavirus infection [4] . Therefore, intensive glucose monitoring may be necessary for COVID-19 patients, especially for those who has underlying diabetes, hyperglycemia (fasting blood glucose\u22657mmol/L) or receiving corticosteroid treatment.",

Frequent and invasive blood sampling means increased risk of occupational exposure for nurses when closely contacting with COVID-19 patients. In fact, high prevalence of infection in medical staffs who battled against this pandemic has already attracted greater attention. As was reported by National Health Commission of China, a total of 3,387 medical workers were infected with COVID-19 by 24 February 2020. In Lombardy, Italy, as of 12 March 2020, 20% of health care workers at intensive care 3 units suffered from coronavirus infection [5] . An investigation on clinical characteristics of 30 medical workers infected with COVID-19 indicated that close contact (within 1 meter) was the main transmission route under such circumstance [6] . Therefore, considering the increased risk of occupational exposures in traditional glucose monitoring, noninvasive operations and advanced devices which could reduce close contact and occupational exposures should be applied and promoted in hospital.",
