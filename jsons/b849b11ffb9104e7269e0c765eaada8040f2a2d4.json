Ever since these reports, there has been a surge of new discoveries in this research area, and as a result, new functional roles of nucleic acids have emerged, including their involvement in gene regulation (Breaker 2004 ). Many ribozymes have been found in biological systems catalyzing important biochemical reactions, which include splicing of mRNAs (Doudna and Cech 2002) and peptide bond formation at the core of the ribosome (Leung et al. 2011 ). Moreover, a number of ribozymes with a wide variety of functions have been discovered in the laboratory using an elegant test tube evolution method called in vitro selection (Joyce 2007) . These discoveries also shook the notion that not only proteins but also nucleic acids can function as catalysts with high precision and impressive rate enhancements. The ability of RNA to catalyze a particular reaction is aided by its propensity to fold and adopt defined 3D structures and thereby facilitate metal ion or cofactor-assisted catalysis (Lilley 2011) . After the discovery of ribozymes, the possibility of the existence of DNA catalysts based on singlestranded DNAs was speculated the mid-1980s (Kruger et al. 1982) , but no such catalysts have yet been found in any domains of life. In 1994, the first DNA catalyst was discovered in the laboratory using in vitro selection. Single-stranded DNA was shown to site-specifically cleave an RNA phosphodiester bond with the assistance of Pb 2+ ions (Breaker and Joyce 1994) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 225, "end": 245, "text": "(Kruger et al. 1982;", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 246, "end": 274, "text": "Guerrier-Takada et al. 1983)", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 484, "end": 497, "text": "(Breaker 2004", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 630, "end": 652, "text": "(Doudna and Cech 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 708, "end": 726, "text": "(Leung et al. 2011", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 904, "end": 916, "text": "(Joyce 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 1269, "end": 1282, "text": "(Lilley 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 1427, "end": 1447, "text": "(Kruger et al. 1982)", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1726, "end": 1750, "text": "(Breaker and Joyce 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The unique ability of single-stranded DNA to catalyze RNA cleavage prompted researchers to capitalize on the catalytic potential of DNA. Since DNA, unlike RNA, lacks a 2 0 -OH group and bears a 5-methyl group in uridine (i.e., thymidine), a question that remained to be answered was if DNA has the ability to achieve the catalytic diversity exhibited by ribozymes. Later in vitro selection experiments have shown ample evidence that DNA catalysis is not limited by the chemistry of the reaction but rather by the techniques involved to identify active DNA sequences. As a consequence, in addition to a series of RNA-cleaving enzymes, new DNA catalysts have been identified in a number of laboratories. These include DNA enzymes, which are capable of performing oxidative and hydrolytic cleavage of DNA (Carmi et al. 1998 , Chandra et al. 2009 ), DNA phosphorylation (Li and Breaker 1999) , DNA adenylation (Li et al. 2000b) , phosphoramidate cleavage (Burmeister et al. 1997) , peroxidation (Travascio et al. 1998) , thymine dimer cleavage (Chinnapen and Sen 2004) , porphyrin metalation (Li and Sen 1996) , formation of phosphorothioester linkage (Levy and Ellington 2001) , linear RNA ligation (formation both 2 0 -5 0 and 3 0 -5 0 linkages) (Purtha et al. 2005; Kost et al. 2008) , synthesis of 2 0 ,5 0 -branched nucleic acids (Coppins and Silverman 2004; Lee et al. 2011) , lariat RNA synthesis (Wang and Silverman 2005) , DNA depurination (Sheppard et al. 2000; H\u20ac obartner et al. 2007 ), formation of nucleopeptide linkages ) and nucleopeptides (Wong et al. 2011) , and C-C bond formation (Diels-Alder reaction) (Chandra and Silverman 2008) .

These enzymes find broad applications not only in the conventional laboratory settings to manipulate large RNAs (Pyle et al. 2000; Silverman and Baum 2009 ) but also in the field of chemical sensing (Willner et al. 2008 ) and in the therapeutic arena, where they have shown the potential to downregulate gene expression (Baum and Silverman 2008) . RNA-cleaving DNA enzymes offer specific advantages over RNA-cleaving ribozymes due to their chemical stability, easy accessibility by chemical solid-phase synthesis, and costeffectiveness. The two major classes of RNA-cleaving enzymes are 10-23 and 8-17, both of which have been widely used in the above-mentioned applications. Both of these enzymes have a short catalytic core of 13-15 nt and recognize the target RNA sequence with the binding arms through Watson-Crick base pairing. Both enzymes require mostly divalent metal cations such as Mg 2+ , Mn 2+ , Zn 2+ , Ca 2+ , etc., for achieving efficient catalysis. Under optimized conditions, the 10-23 DNA enzyme exhibits k cat /K m of 10 9 , which rivals the catalytic efficiency of ribozymes such as the hammerhead ribozyme and protein enzymes such as RNase A (Santoro and Joyce 1998) . This fact underscores the robustness of DNA catalysis and provides opportunities to harness the catalytic activities of DNA for practical applications. Herein we review in vitro selection techniques used to identify RNA-cleaving DNA enzymes and summarize kinetic and mechanistic insights on the RNA cleavage reaction revealed by various biochemical and biophysical studies.

The subtle difference between in vitro selection and in vitro evolution techniques should be noted. If the process involves the identification of enzymes from the initial library of sequences without introducing genetic diversity between individual rounds of selective amplification, the procedure is called in vitro selection. However, if additional diversity is introduced, for example, using error-prone PCR during the selection process or a reselection is carried out using partially randomized libraries (based on the sequence information emerged from the initial selection), the process is called in vitro evolution. The random library is usually constructed by solid-phase DNA synthesis using a mixture of all four phosphoramidites in appropriate ratios based on their coupling efficiency (T > G > C > A). The DNA pool is generally designed with two well-defined primer binding sites, which enable PCR amplification after the selection step, and a random region, which usually varies from 20 to 80 nt in length. The length of the random region defines the sequence space (i.e., all possible sequences for a random region of length n \u00bc 4 n ). For example, a random region of 40 nt has a sequence space of 4 40 \u00bc 10 24 sequences, which is impossible to sample experimentally due to practical limitations. To illustrate this, a 60-nt-long DNA pool containing 40 random nucleotides would require 1.6 mols of DNA, i.e., 30 kg, in order to achieve complete coverage of all 10 24 possible sequences. In practice, typically 0.2-2 nanomoles of DNA pool is used to initiate the selection. This accounts to 10 14 -10 15 different molecules, which offer a sampling of only 10 \u00c09 -10 \u00c010 (e.g., 10 14 /10 24 \u00bc 10 \u00c010 ) of the sequence space. Increasing the length of the random region therefore leads to a decrease in the coverage of sequence space [for a detailed discussion, see Silverman (2008) ]. A number of selection experiments have shown that a very large random region is not required to identify efficient DNA catalysts with a wide variety of functions (Silverman 2008; Schlosser and Li 2009a) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 153, "end": 165, "text": "(Joyce 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 2043, "end": 2059, "text": "Silverman (2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF101"}, {"start": 2225, "end": 2241, "text": "(Silverman 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF101"}, {"start": 2242, "end": 2265, "text": "Schlosser and Li 2009a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF91"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "In Vitro Selection Strategies"}, {"text": "Two strategies for the in vitro selection process employed to identify RNAcleaving DNA enzymes are shown in Fig. 1 , termed \"bead-based\" and \"gel-based\" strategies (Santoro and Joyce 1997; Cruz et al. 2004 ). One of the crucial steps in this process is the physical separation of active DNA molecules from inactive ones. In the bead-based approach, this is usually accomplished by the help of a biotin tag which assists in retaining the inactive sequences on a streptavidin column after cleavage of the target RNA in the selection step (Fig. 1a) . More stringent separations can be achieved in the gel-based approach, where the active enzymes are separated based on their different mobility in denaturing PAGE due to the size difference imparted during the cleavage step (Fig. 1b) . These methods demand that the substrate and the DNA pool are covalently joined together at the beginning of the selection experiment. Therefore, in the first step of a selection cycle, the DNA pool is attached to an RNA substrate (or to a DNA containing an embedded ribonucleotide) either by performing PCR using a biotinylated primer or by enzymatic ligation (using T4 DNA or T4 RNA ligase). This is followed by the selection step in which parameters such as buffer, pH, temperature, metal ion concentration, and incubation time are varied to set up different selection experiments in order to identify the most efficient DNA enzymes. The selection step is followed by fishing out the active DNA enzyme sequences using the methods described above. Then, the selected sequences are PCR amplified using appropriate primers. If the separation is carried out using the bead-based approach, the biotinylated primer will enable the capture of PCR product on the streptavidin column. A denaturation step is then performed to remove the undesired complementary strand of the double-stranded PCR product. If the separation involves a gel-based strategy, a reverse primer with an embedded ribonucleotide or a nonamplifiable linker is used. This provides the opportunity to generate a size difference in the amplified products required for PAGE-based separation of single-stranded DNA. This is achieved either by cleaving the ribonucleotide linkage or by utilizing the inherent difference in the size of the two strands. The selection and amplification steps are continued until no further increase in cleavage activity is observed. This typically requires between 5 and 15 round of in vitro selection. The individual sequences are then identified by the typical cloning and automated sequencing procedures. The cleavage activity of individual deoxyribozymes is analyzed by using solid-phase synthesized oligonucleotides that bind to the target RNA in a bimolecular format. This is usually referred to as \"in trans\" assay format, compared to the monomolecular \"in cis\" architecture used during selection.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 164, "end": 188, "text": "(Santoro and Joyce 1997;", "ref_id": "BIBREF88"}, {"start": 189, "end": 205, "text": "Cruz et al. 2004", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 108, "end": 114, "text": "Fig. 1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 536, "end": 545, "text": "(Fig. 1a)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 771, "end": 780, "text": "(Fig. 1b)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "In Vitro Selection Strategies"}, {"text": "The chemical reaction catalyzed by all known RNA-cleaving deoxyribozymes is the formation of a 2 0 ,3 0 -cyclic phosphate and a free 5 0 -hydroxyl terminus, originating from the nucleophilic attack of a 2 0 -hydroxyl group of the substrate random nt \"bead-based\" selection \"gel-based\" selection oligonucleotide on the adjacent phosphodiester bond (Fig. 2a) . In principle, such an intramolecular cleavage reaction can occur randomly upon incubation of RNA under alkaline conditions. Deoxyribozymes, however, specifically cleave RNA only at predefined internal positions under mild conditions. The site specificity is programmed via the Watson-Crick base-paired binding arms, which generally leave 1 nt at the target site unpaired. The considerable rate enhancements and extremely high selectivities for particular sites render deoxyribozymes attractive tools for various applications. The first reported deoxyribozyme catalyzed the cleavage of the phosphodiester bond on the 3 0 -side of single embedded ribonucleotide in a DNA substrate by using Pb 2+ as a divalent metal ion cofactor (Breaker and Joyce 1994) . At pH 7.0 and 23 C, in the presence of 1 mM Pb(OAc) 2 , the DNA catalyst was able to cut its substrate in a bimolecular fashion and showed impressive Michaelis-Menten behavior, with k cat of 1 min \u00c01 and K m of 2 mM, yielding ca. 30 turnovers per hour at a catalyst concentration of 0.01 mM and a substrate concentration of 1 mM. The rate enhancement over the uncatalyzed background reaction (10 \u00c04 min \u00c01 ) under comparable conditions amounts to 10 5 . Although this initially reported deoxyribozyme was not capable of cleaving an all-RNA substrate, this prototype DNA catalyst spurred the development of successor deoxyribozymes that now offer highly useful properties. The most prominent and most widely studied classes of RNA-cleaving deoxyribozymes are the 10-23 and 8-17 DNA catalysts (Fig. 2b, c) , which were first reported in 1997 (Santoro and Joyce 1997) . A large variety of other RNA-cleaving DNA catalysts has been isolated by in vitro selection under various conditions, including specific metal ions or pH conditions. For example, DNA enzymes have been characterized that cleave (fluorophore-labeled) chimeric RNA-DNA substrates under acidic conditions, ranging from pH 3 to pH 6 (Liu et al. 2003) . Others have been selected for the specific detection of uranium as uranyl ions UO 2 2+ ). An interesting RNA-cleaving deoxyribozyme has been generated from a binary nucleotide alphabet, which contains only guanosine and cytosine nucleotides, and still exhibits considerable Mn 2+ -dependent cleavage activity (Schlosser and Li 2009b ). An overview on selected examples of RNA-cleaving DNA enzymes and respective references can be found in Table 1 . Excellent reviews are available that describe the details of in vitro selection and characterization of these DNA catalysts (Silverman 2005; Baum and Silverman 2008; Schlosser and Li 2010) . In the following section, we focus on 10-23 and 8-17 DNA enzymes since most preclinical studies on DNA catalysts as therapeutic agents have been conducted with 10-23 deoxyribozymes, and 8-17 variants have found wide applications as components of biosensors.

The names are rather arbitrary and reflect the selection round and the clone number of the identified DNA. Both DNA enzymes turned out as useful catalysts to cleave all-RNA substrates with practically useful rate constants, ranging from 0.1 min \u00c01 under simulated physiological conditions (2 mM Mg 2+ ) and up to 10 min \u00c01 in the presence of high divalent metal ion concentrations (100 mM Mg 2+ ). Although the DNA enzymes have been biochemically characterized (Santoro and Joyce 1998) , the exact catalytic mechanism of RNA cleavage is not yet understood in detail. Currently, no structure of a deoxyribozyme in an active conformation is known. A small number of reports describe attempts to solve the X-ray crystal structure of the10-23 DNA in complex with an uncleavable substrate (Nowakowski et al. 1999 ). However, the crystals revealed a dimeric DNA structure in an unproductive conformation that resembled a Holliday junction structure. A preliminary report on NMR structural studies confirmed secondary structure formation between substrate and deoxyribozyme, but no follow-up studies on more detailed NMR structural data have yet been reported (Choi et al. 2000) . Below we summarize the reported results from biochemical and biophysical investigations on 10-23 and give a short overview on selected data on DNA folding studies of 8-17 deoxyribozymes [a recent comprehensive review on 8-17 DNA enzymes can be found in (Schlosser and Li 2010) ].", "cite_spans": [{"start": 197, "end": 221, "text": "(Santoro and Joyce 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF88"}, {"start": 685, "end": 709, "text": "(Santoro and Joyce 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF89"}, {"start": 1008, "end": 1031, "text": "(Nowakowski et al. 1999", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 1377, "end": 1395, "text": "(Choi et al. 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1651, "end": 1674, "text": "(Schlosser and Li 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF93"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "On Mechanism and Folding of 10-23 and 8-17 Deoxyribozymes"}, {"text": "The 10-23 deoxyribozyme generally cleaves an RNA substrate between a purine and a pyrimidine nucleotide (see Fig. 2b ) and is active in the presence of Mg 2+ , Mn 2+ , or Ca 2+ as divalent metal ion cofactor (Santoro and Joyce 1998) . A linear increase in k obs with a slope close to 1 was observed between pH 6.5 and 8.5, indicating that a single deprotonation event is part of the rate-determining step of RNA cleavage. Most likely, this reflects deprotonation of the 2 0 -OH group at the cleavage site, but it is not known if any of the core nucleotides could act as a general base to assists the deprotonation. In order to identify functionally relevant nucleotides in the catalytic core of the 10-23 DNA catalyst, a comprehensive mutation analysis was performed (Zaborowska et al. 2002) . All 15 nt in the catalytic core were individually replaced by each of the other three natural nucleotides. The activity of the 45 mutants was evaluated by single time-point measurements of the cleaved RNA fraction under single turnover conditions (37 C, 20 min, in 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 10 mM Mg 2+ ). Selected mutants were used for full kinetic measurements of k obs . A number of nucleotides were found to be important (summarized in Table 2 ): nucleotides G1, G2, T4, G6, and G14 could not be replaced by any other nucleotide without complete loss of catalytic activity. In contrast, nucleotides at positions 7-12 could mostly be exchanged to any other of the natural nucleotides. In addition, the exocyclic functional groups of certain nucleotides were investigated. For example, inosine ( Fig. 3) was comprehensively tested at all positions, and interesting results were found at positions C3 and C13. Based on the striking difference of adenosine and inosine substitution (adenosines were partially tolerated in place of cytidines, but inosines were detrimental), it was speculated that an exocyclic amino group is essential (originating from C or A). For position G6, the O 6 -carbonyl group was found to be the most important feature because activity was abolished with adenine, but inosine did not have any effect. At position G14, both the N 2 -amino and the O 6 -carbonyl groups were essential, as indicated by the intolerance for inosine and 2-aminopurine. Interestingly, at position A5, cytidine showed some activity, but inosine was detrimental, again pointing toward an important amino group. However, when A5 was changed to purine, no change in activity was observed, indicating that another functional group must be responsible for the observed effects.

Recently, combinatorial methods have been developed for the simultaneous assessment of all nucleotides in the catalytic core of DNA enzymes. Combinatorial mutation interference analysis (Wachowius et al. 2010 ) and nucleotide analog interference mapping of DNA (Wachowius and H\u20ac obartner 2011) were also applied to 10-23 and efficiently revealed essential residues that are largely comparable to the results from individual mutants (C. H\u20ac obartner, F. Wachowius, unpublished results). To further narrow down the features of the catalyst, another study addressed the deletion of individual nucleotides from the 10-23 core (Zaborowska et al. 2005) . It was found that C7 and T8 can be separately removed without severely affecting cleavage activity, but other tested deletions were detrimental. The double deletion of C7 and T8 resulted in about twofold reduced k obs compared to the unmodified DNA, but the shortened deoxyribozyme was not able to cleave long RNA substrates. The effect of deleting individual nucleobases (instead of entire nucleotides) was systematically examined by replacing every nucleotide with an abasic site analog (a tetrahydrofuran derivative, Fig. 3 . Additionally, every nucleotide was replaced by an acyclic C3 linker (Fig. 3) , which keeps the same number of atoms in the backbone chain, but confers much increased conformational flexibility to the DNA chain. The results from this study corroborated earlier findings on nucleotide requirements in the catalytic core and, in addition, defined the importance of structural preorganization of the DNA backbone by certain 2 0 -deoxyribose units. It is interesting to point out that substitution of T8 with an abasic site or the acyclic linker resulted in slightly increased deoxyribozyme activity compared to the parent DNA, whereas deletion of the entire nucleotide resulted in about twofold reduced k obs . However, it should be noted that the activity tests were done with a substrate containing a single embedded ribonucleotide, as opposed to the full RNA substrate used in the deletion and mutation analyses (Zaborowska et al. 2005) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 330, "end": 352, "text": "(Wachowius et al. 2010", "ref_id": "BIBREF125"}, {"start": 405, "end": 437, "text": "(Wachowius and H\u20ac obartner 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF125"}, {"start": 765, "end": 789, "text": "(Zaborowska et al. 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF134"}, {"start": 2232, "end": 2256, "text": "(Zaborowska et al. 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF134"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1312, "end": 1318, "text": "Fig. 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1389, "end": 1397, "text": "(Fig. 3)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "The 10-23 Deoxyribozyme"}, {"text": "In an earlier study, a 10-23 mutant was identified, which was 4 nt shorter than the parent DNA, and which showed high activity in the presence of Ca 2+ , but had very low activity in the presence of Mg 2+ (Sugimoto et al. 1999) .

In a comprehensive study reported in 2003, all loop nucleotides were systematically replaced by their 2 0 -OMe counterparts (Schubert et al. 2003) . The activity assay revealed that the 2 0 -OMe group was detrimental at 9 out of 15 loop positions. When the remaining 6 nt simultaneously contained the 2 0 -OMe modification, the k obs dropped by only twofold. A detailed discussion on the effect of 2 0 -OMe modifications can be found in Sect. 5.2. More recently, the influence of 2 0 -Cmethyl modified uridine nucleotides (Fig. 3) at positions 4 and 8 of the 10-23 core sequence was investigated (Robaldo et al. 2010) . The absolute configuration of the methyl group had a pronounced effect on the catalytic activity. This observation is most likely related to the different preferred sugar pucker conformations of 2 0 -(R)and 2 0 -(S)-CH 3 modified nucleosides. Interestingly, incorporation of the 2 0 -(S)-CH 3 derivative at position 8 had little effect, whereas the 2 0 -(R)-CH 3 derivative reduced the cleavage rate by tenfold, at different Mg 2+ concentrations between 0.5 and 10 mM. This is interesting with respect to the above-mentioned finding that nucleotide T8 can be deleted without significantly affecting DNA activity. Introducing the modification at position 4 resulted in mostly inactive DNA variants at low Mg 2+ concentrations. This 2 0 -C-methyl ribose modification is also appealing with respect to increased nuclease resistance of the modified DNA. Along the same lines, it should be mentioned that LNA nucleotides ( Fig. 4) were tested at positions T4 and T8 in the catalytic core of the deoxyribozyme (Robaldo et al. 2010 ). Although LNA-T was more or less tolerated at T4, the T8-modified and doublemodified derivatives exhibited drastically reduced catalytic activity, again indicating sensitivity to local structural changes induced by the conformationally restricted nucleotides. In contrast, LNA and 2 0 -OMe modifications were shown to be beneficial when introduced into the binding arms of 10-23 deoxyribozymes (Schubert et al. 2003; Donini et al. 2007 ).

Therefore, it is important to investigate functional and essential phosphate groups in the deoxyribozyme core region. In this respect, one nonbridging phosphate oxygen was systematically replaced by sulfur at every internucleotide phosphodiester bond of 10-23 (Nawrot et al. 2007 ). The cleavage kinetics were investigated in the presence of Mg 2+ and of Mn 2+ , in order to analyze the \"thio\" and \"rescue\" effects, following the hard and soft acids and bases (HSAB) principle. In the presence of Mg 2+ , a 16-fold reduction in k obs was observed when the phosphorothioate (PS) modification was placed at A5. This derivative also showed the largest rescue effect with Mn 2+ (k obs Mn/k obs Mg \u00bc 176). By a combination with 6-thioguanosine substitution at position G6, it was suggested that a likely metal ion binding site is formed involving the carbonyl group of G6 and the phosphodiester between T4 and A5. Additional indication for a potential metal ion interaction was observed for the phosphodiester between T8 and A9. At nucleotides 3, 6, 7, and 14 of the loop, the sulfur substitution was well tolerated, and at nucleotides 1 and 8, the phosphorothioate even enhanced catalytic activity. It should also be noted as an advantage that the phosphorothioate modification confers increased nuclease stability to the DNA. Improved activity combined with increased Fig. 4 Chemical modifications that have been introduced in RNA-cleaving DNA enzymes to impart drug-like properties stability provides interesting opportunities for biological or therapeutic applications (see also Sect. 5). In addition, the effect of phosphorothioate substitution at the scissile phosphate in the RNA substrate was investigated. Differential effects were found for the activity of 10-23 upon interaction with R p -and S p -phosphorothioatecontaining substrates (Nawrot et al. 2008; He et al. 2002) . While the S p thio analog was efficiently cleaved with only slightly reduced rates compared to the unmodified RNA substrate, the R p -configured phosphorothioate was resistant to cleavage by 10-23, even at high Mg 2+ concentrations (up to 100 mM). Interestingly, this severe thio effect could not be rescued by the more thiophilic Mn 2+ ions. These results suggest that the nonbridging oxygen atoms at the scissile phosphodiester bond are most likely not directly coordinated to metal ions, thus indicating that the catalytic mechanism does not involve metal-mediated charge neutralization at the nonbridging oxygen atoms. Rather, it is likely that metal ions directly coordinate to the 2 0 oxygen and 5 0 oxygen, facilitating deprotonation of the attacking 2 0 -OH group and neutralization of the developing charge at the 5 0 -phosphate terminus. Furthermore, it was hypothesized that the proton of the 2 0 -OH group migrates to the pro-R p oxygen of the phosphate. This is consistent with the inactive nature of the R p (S) substrate since the lower pK A of the phosphorothioate compared to an unmodified phosphate would render H-migration less plausible. Further studies are expected in the near future, taking advantage of recently reported methods to produce 3 0 -and 5 0 -phosphorothiolate substrates, that could be helpful for disentangling the metal ion contributions to DNA-catalyzed RNA cleavage, similar to strategies employed for the investigation of ribozyme catalysis (Frederiksen and Piccirilli 2009) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 386, "end": 405, "text": "(Nawrot et al. 2007", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 1968, "end": 1988, "text": "(Nawrot et al. 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 1989, "end": 2004, "text": "He et al. 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 3489, "end": 3522, "text": "(Frederiksen and Piccirilli 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1491, "end": 1497, "text": "Fig. 4", "ref_id": null}], "section": "The 10-23 Deoxyribozyme"}, {"text": "Although there are some striking similarities between DNA-catalyzed RNA cleavage and hammerhead ribozyme activity, some experimental results do not fit into the picture of superimposable mechanisms.

While the hammerhead ribozyme gives a bell-shaped curve of activity versus increasing La 3+concentrations (in a background of constant Mg 2+ concentration, i.e., activation at low [La 3+ ] and inhibition at high [La 3+ ]), the 10-23 DNA enzyme shows gradual inhibition (investigated between 0.5 and 10 mM LaCl 3 ) (He et al. 2002) . Lanthanide probes were also used for studying the RNA cleavage by a Pb 2+ -dependent deoxyribozyme (Geyer and Sen 1998) , which was found to tolerate lanthanide ions for phosphodiester cleavage. A single lanthanide ion was most likely directly interacting with the 2 0 -OH group at the cleavage site. Different lanthanides were tested, showing that the smaller lanthanides (Tb 3+ , Tm 3+ , Lu 3+ ) more efficiently supported DNA-catalyzed phosphodiester cleavage compared to larger ones (Eu 3+ , Nd 3+ , Ce 3+ , La 3+ ). These results were corroborated by Tb 3+ luminescence experiments involving unmodified and phosphorothioate-containing substrates, which showed that the 2 0 -OH group was required for efficient Tb 3+ binding, but the phosphate backbone at the cleavage site was likely not involved in direct metal ion contacts (Geyer and Sen 1998) .

Fluorescence anisotropy experiments at different Mg 2+ concentrations were also reported. The results showed that structural transitions in the DNA enzyme leading to a decreased end-to-end distance of the fluorophores occur at rather low Mg 2+ concentrations, at which the deoxyribozyme does not yet have full activity (i.e., the folding midpoint observed by FRET was at~2 mM Mg 2+ ). Since higher Mg 2+ resulted in improved cleavage activity, but no further reduction of the FRET distances was observed, it was suggested that structural transitions at low Mg 2+ concentrations are not sufficient for optimal catalytic activity. However, it is also conceivable that the single combination of fluorophores at terminal positions might not be ideal to observe subtle conformational changes required for activity.

Interestingly, this motif has been isolated more than five times from independent in vitro selection experiments in different laboratories (Li et al. 2000a; Peracchi 2000; Cruz et al. 2004; Schlosser et al. 2008a ). The recurrence of this small motif makes it an interesting subject for fundamental studies on DNA catalysis but also has a practical benefit as a small, cheap, stable, and versatile endoribonuclease.

These are confined to A6, G7, C13, and G14 (underlined in Fig. 2c ). Using deoxyribozyme analogs with modified nucleotides, the functional groups of these 4 nt essential for catalytic activity have been identified (Peracchi et al. 2005) . It was found that A6 and G7 are sensitive to sterically demanding substitutions since m 6 A (Fig. 3) had a larger impact on catalysis than purine at position A6, and s 6 G supported catalysis even less efficiently than 2-aminopurine at position G7, which slowed down the reaction by about 1,000-fold. These results suggested the presence of a functionally important hydrogen-bonding network involving various H-bonding donors and acceptors of these two purine nucleotides. The most critical functional group of G14 was found to be the exocyclic amino group. Interestingly, s 6 G ( Fig. 3 ) was well tolerated under standard reaction conditions, but activity was strongly inhibited by submillimolar concentrations of thiophilic Cd 2+ ions. This suggested that a strong direct metal coordination at this functional group does not support catalysis. On the contrary, the nucleotide at position 12 was found to modulate the metal ion cofactor requirements. While 8-17 with thymidine at position 12 is active with Mg 2+ , Mn 2+ , and Ca 2+ to similar extents, a DNA enzyme with inosine at position 12 used Ca 2+ fivefold more efficiently than the parent enzyme (activity with Mg 2+ and Mn 2+ was even slightly inhibited by the inosine mutation).

The bulk study used a fluorophore-labeled DNA enzyme in complex with an inactivated substrate, in which the ribonucleotide at the cleavage site was replaced by a deoxyribonucleotide (Kim et al. 2007a ). The DNA enzyme was found to fold into a pyramidal structure in the presence of Mg 2+ and Zn 2+ , but with Pb 2+ , no global folding transition was observed (although Pb 2+ is the most effective cofactor). A recent three-color bulk FRET study tried to correlate the metal-dependent folding with the identity of the dinucleotide junction in the substrate (Lam and Li 2010) . It was found that DNA enzyme-substrate complexes with purine-purine junctions folded at lower Mn 2+ concentrations than those containing pyrimidine-pyrimidine junctions, which is consistent with cleavage activity studies. Nevertheless, bulk studies with inactive substrates may be suboptimal to support strong conclusions on folding transitions. To exclude adverse effects of the inactive substrates which might change metal-binding properties, single-molecule FRET experiments were carried out which allow individual active deoxyribozymes to be studied with cleavable substrates. Moreover, smFRET can detect and distinguish less populated conformations that may be important for activity but that cannot be resolved in bulk FRET measurements. Using a total internal reflection (TIR) fluorescence microscope to observe fluorescently labeled, surface-bound deoxyribozymes, two distinct folding pathways that depend on the identity of the metal ion cofactor were confirmed (Kim et al. 2007b ). In the presence of Mg 2+ and Zn 2+ , a structural change occurs before the cleavage step. In contrast, Pb 2+ is accommodated in a prearranged conformation of the deoxyribozyme which directly leads to RNA cleavage. In another report, threecolor alternating-laser excitation (3c-ALEX) was used to study the branched structure of 8-17 at the single-molecule level in solution (Lee et al. 2007 ).

First of all, DNA enzymes do not require any cellular enzymes like RNase H (as for antisense strategies) or argonaute 2 (as for RNAi) to exhibit their cleavage activity on target RNAs. Compared to ribozymes, DNA enzymes are more target specific, and due to their versatility in target cleavage, identification of potential targets is relatively easy. Moreover, DNA is cheap and easy to synthesize compared to siRNAs or ribozymes. However, similar to other antisense technologies, the therapeutic utility of DNA enzyme is hampered by the present lack of efficient delivery agents. Therefore, although a plethora of reports is available in the literature on the use of DNA enzymes in in vitro settings and in animal models (Dass et al. 2008; Benson et al. 2008; Peracchi 2004) , no clinical trials have so far been reported for an RNA-cleaving DNA enzyme. The therapeutic targets of RNA-cleaving DNA enzymes can be broadly classified into cancer, cardiovascular, allergy-related, bacterial, and viral targets.

For a comprehensive outlook, readers are directed to the recent reviews available in the literature (Bhindi et al. 2007; Dass et al. 2008; Benson et al. 2008; Peracchi 2004; Achenbach et al. 2004 ). Here we focus on DNA enzyme-based strategies against bacteria and viruses.

ICL is an enzyme which plays an important role in the metabolism of M. tuberculosis in the latent state of infection in macrophages. Therefore, ICL is one of the emerging targets for antituberculosis therapy. In vitro cleavage assays on a 1,871-nt-long ICL transcript in the presence of 15 mM Mg 2+ (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0 at 37 C) revealed modest target attenuation by four out of five DNA enzymes tested. Under the same conditions, an analogous enzyme bearing mutations in the catalytic core was completely inactive. The DNA enzymes were tested to evaluate their ability to suppress the expression of ICL and thereby reduce the survival of M. tuberculosis in THP-1 cells. Since DNA enzymes were not capable of penetrating the cell wall of M. tuberculosis, suboptimal concentration of the antituberculosis drug isoniazid (INH) was used to soften the cell wall. After 4 and 7 days of treatment with DNA 100% RNA cleavage Schubert et al. (2004) expr. expression, mod. modification enzyme at 5 mM concentrations, the bacterial growth (CFU levels) was reduced to 55-60% in comparison with the untreated cells. Since this initial work, no further studies have been reported on ICL-targeting DNA enzymes. Tryptophan-aspartate-containing coat protein (TACO) plays a crucial role in the survival of M. tuberculosis in macrophages. Recently, researches have reported an efficient way to target this protein by generating 10-23 DNA enzymes in macrophages with the help of a single-stranded DNA expression vector based on Moloney mouse leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (MMLV-RT) . To enhance the expression efficiency, the MMLV-RT gene and the oligonucleotide sequences for generating the DNA enzymes were cloned into a single plasmid under the control of two separate promoters. The vector was designed to generate the 10-23 DNA enzyme, which targets the coding region of TACO-mRNA. Control plasmids expressing mutant enzymes were also constructed. The efficiency of the active DNA containing vector was verified in murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7. Semiquantitative RT-PCR assays revealed a 78% reduction of TACO-mRNA levels at 48 h posttransfection. The corresponding reduction of the TACO-protein revealed by Western blot was 75%. Mutant plasmids did not induce any reduction of the mRNA or the protein levels. Though these results are encouraging in terms of DNA enzyme delivery, the need to coexpress viral transcriptase might lead to adverse effects. Moreover, the usefulness of this approach to reduce M. tuberculosis infection has not yet been reported.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 130, "end": 146, "text": "(Li et al. 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 1070, "end": 1092, "text": "Schubert et al.

When tested in DH5apro cells, the single-stranded DNA expression vector was not only able to downregulate the ftsZ gene expression (revealed by Western blot) but was also able to repress bacterial cell proliferation. This was evident in the reduction (55-65%) of CFU levels and also in the formation of long filamentous cells.

One of the important targets in this class is b-lactamase mRNA since b-lactamase is responsible for bacterial resistance against b-lactam antibiotics. Two 10-23 DNA enzymes targeting the start codon as well as the coding region of b-lactamase mRNA were designed (Chen et al. 2004a) . A di-DNA enzyme was also designed by coupling two single DNA enzymes in tandem. In vitro cleavage kinetics using a short RNA substrate in the presence of 10 mM Mg 2+ (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6 at 37 C) revealed that the DNA enzyme targeting the coding region had higher catalytic efficiency [k cat /K m \u00bc 9.1 \u00c2 10 7 (mol/L) \u00c01 min \u00c01 ] than the enzyme targeting the start codon site [k cat /K m \u00bc 6.4 \u00c2 10 7 (mol/L) \u00c01 min \u00c01 ] and the di-DNA enzyme [k cat /K m \u00bc 3.1 \u00c2 10 7 (mol/L) \u00c01 min \u00c01 ]. This augmented catalytic efficiency of the enzyme against the coding region has been attributed to the increase in the target binding affinity (low K m ) due to high GC content in the binding arms. All the DNA enzymes were able to cleave a full-length b-lactamase RNA transcript (885 nt) with varying efficiencies (40-70% at 2 h). For in vivo studies, DNA enzymes have been delivered into ampicillin-resistant bacteria (TEM-1 and TEM-3) by electroporation. After 9 h, the growth inhibition assays and the b-lactamase activity measurement revealed that the di-DNA enzyme was most efficient in attenuating the drug-resistant mRNA. This is reflected in 58% growth inhibition for TEM-1 bacteria and 63% growth inhibition for TEM-3 bacteria. DNA enzymes bearing mutations in the catalytic core or in the binding arm did not show any activity. This underlines the specificity of the DNA enzymemediated approach to silence the b-lactamase mRNA. The enhanced in vivo activity of the di-DNA enzyme is intriguing, considering the complex structure of the DNA enzyme due to the presence of multiple catalytic loops and binding arms. To address the limitations of exogenous delivery of DNA enzymes to bacteria, researchers constructed a single-stranded DNA vector to express 10-23 DNA enzymes in vivo (Chen et al. 2004b ). Using an M13mp18 phage vector, two circular DNA enzymes which target the same start codon and coding region of b-lactamase mRNA were generated. The catalytic efficiency of circular DNA enzymes was reduced to 25-30% of the corresponding linear DNA enzymes. The circular enzymes were shown to replicate inside the TEM-1 and TEM-3 bacteria and also were shown to inhibit bacterial growth. The enzyme targeted to the translation initiation site leads to 46% growth inhibition (53% reduction in b-lactamase activity), while the enzyme targeted to the start codon region leads to 71% growth inhibition (67% reduction in b-lactamase activity). Though these results are encouraging, the viability of these approaches in macrophages has not been reported so far.

A 10-23 enzyme modified with phosphorothioate linkages (PS) (see Fig. 4 ) in its binding arms has been introduced into MRSA strain WHO-2 by electroporation.

Control experiments using unrelated DNA enzymes and a 14-mer oligonucleotide lacking the catalytic loop failed to induce any activity. This underlines the specificity of the DNA enzymes against CCR5.

One was used to target any AU cleavage site in all AUG codons, and the other one was designed to target any purine-pyrimidine junction in the HIV 1-GAG RNA. After an extensive target screening (10 mM MgCl 2 in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8 at 37 C) followed by primer extension analyses, the substrate binding sequences of two enzymes were identified which were able to cleave an AU junction (Dz-1836) and a GC junction (Dz-1810), respectively. However, in vitro cleavage assays using 220-nt transcripts revealed that the activity of both enzymes was suboptimal (<10% cleavage, 10 mM Mg 2+ ). Even under 50 mM Mg 2+ conditions, the cleavage ability of the Dz1810 was only less than 20%. The cleavage assays using 740-nt-long GAG RNA transcript in the presence of 10 mM Mg 2+ showed improved efficacy for Dz1810, while the Dz-1836 showed complete target cleavage. The RT-PCR analysis 48 h after transfection of COS-1 cells with GAG RNA expressing reporter and DNA enzymes revealed that Dz-1836 was able to suppress the GAG RNA levels tenfold, while the Dz-1810 enzyme was completely inactive. The anti-HIV activity of the Dz-1836 was further verified in COS-1 cells using a luciferase-based reporter assay in which~95% reduction in the luciferase activity was observed 48 h after transfection.

Using this approach, a 220-nt HIV-1 Gag transcript was cleaved by 10-23 and 8-17 DNA enzymes which were found to be inefficient without the use of antisense oligos.

Several 10-23 enzymes with 7-nt binding arms were designed against the loop regions of TAT or TAT/REV RNA and tested for the cleavage efficiency under different Mg 2+ concentrations. One 10-23 enzyme was able to cleave a 280-nt TAT RNA transcript efficiently in the presence of 1-5 mM Mg 2+ (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8 at 37 C). RT-PCR analysis of DNA enzyme-treated COS-1 cells revealed eight-to tenfold reduction in TAT expression. The mutant control failed to impart any target reduction, and this supports the specificity of the DNA enzyme-mediated approach to target important genes of HIV-1. It has also been demonstrated that many regions of TAT RNA which are predicted (by secondary structure analysis) to be single stranded are found to be completely inaccessible for DNA enzyme-mediated cleavage. The potency of RNA-cleaving DNA enzyme can also be increased by using them in combination with hammerhead ribozymes (Sood et al. 2007b; Unwalla et al. 2006) .

There was eightfold reduction of TAT RNA observed in RT-PCR assays, when guanosine-modified DNA enzymes were introduced into cells.

The cleavage efficiency was modest, and it varied from 22% to 31%. A 10-23 mutant enzyme failed to cleave the target. One of the enzymes could induce the target cleavage even in the absence of Mg 2+ albeit at very low efficiency. Nevertheless, this is one of the few reports of metal ion-independent cleavage by a 10-23 DNA enzyme. The reason for this unprecedented cleavage activity is not clear from the data available in the literature. The authors also demonstrated modest cleavage efficiency of the 10-23 DNA enzymes under simulated physiological conditions (2 mM Mg 2+ ).

In vitro cleavage assays using a short E6/E7 transcript in the presence of 10 mM Mg 2+ (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM spermidine at 37 C) revealed that the PS and 2 0 -OMe modifications in the catalytic core substantially reduced the cleavage activity compared to unmodified DNA enzymes.

The 3 0 -NCR plays a crucial role in the replication of JEV. Both unmodified and completely PS-modified enzymes were used in these studies.

The HRV14 is one of the viruses responsible for common cold. In vitro cleavage studies have been carried out using a 835-nt RNA transcript, which encodes the HRV14 genome. Both single turnover and multiple turnover experiments were performed in the presence of 10 mM Mg 2+ (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 at 37 C), and the respective rate constant (k obs ) and initial velocity (v init ) were determined to assess the catalytic potential. The cleavage assays revealed that DNA enzymes with 9-nt binding arms and four 2 0 -OMe or four LNA modifications on each binding arms were able to enhance the k obs by factors of 2 and 4, respectively. Under multiple turnover conditions, the 2 0 -OMe-modified enzyme exhibited a sixfold enhancement in initial velocity, while the LNA-modified enzyme had shown a severe deceleration. The adverse effects of LNA-modified enzyme have been attributed to the high target binding, which influences the product release. The presence of PS modification in the binding arms severely affected the target cleavage under single and multiple turnover conditions. This can be attributed to the poor target recognition capabilities of PS modification. When the binding arms were shortened to 7 nt, the k obs and v init were drastically increased to several fold for 2 0 -OMe-and LNA-modified enzymes. For example, an enzyme with 7-nt binding arms having five 2 0 -OMe modifications on each arm enhanced the cleavage activity by 20-fold (k obs \u00bc 0.5 min \u00c01 and v init \u00bc 4.7 nM min \u00c01 ) compared to the unmodified counterpart. Researchers also tried to evaluate the effect of 2 0 -OMe modification in the 15-nt catalytic core of the 10-23 DNA enzyme. Systematic replacement of each nucleotide in the catalytic core with 2 0 -OMe modification led to the identification of six positions (2, 7, 8, 11, 14, and 15) , which are amenable to the modifications without losing the cleavage efficiency. This is one of the very few reports in which chemical modifications have been successfully utilized in the catalytic core of 10-23 enzyme. To address the nuclease vulnerability of DNA enzymes in cellular environment, an optimized DNA enzyme with 7-nt binding arms containing five 2 0 -OMe modifications on each binding arm and six 2 0 -OMe modifications in the catalytic core has been designed. This highly engineered DNA enzyme had an impressive cleavage potential, which is indicated by a tenfold increase in the k obs (0.57 min \u00c01 ) and v init (2 nM min \u00c01 ) compared to the unmodified enzyme. The enzyme exhibited a half-life of 25 h in 10% fetal calf serum. Though these results are promising from the therapeutic point of view, unfortunately, the potential of this modified enzyme to cleave the RNA target of HRV14 in cellular systems is not reported in the literature. In a related study, researchers demonstrated the potential of using 2 0 -OMe or LNA modification on the binding arms of DNA enzymes to cleave inaccessible targets present in the 5 0 -UTR of coxsackievirus (CAV-21) (Schubert et al. 2004) . In spite of the fact that the target site in the CAV-21 shares sequence homology with the 5 0 -UTR of HRV-14, unmodified DNA enzyme in the presence of 10 mM Mg 2+ (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0 at 37 C) could not impart the cleavage of a 797-nt CAV-21 transcript. This shows that target sequences in HRV-14 and CAV-21 do not share similar accessibility features for DNA enzyme-promoted cleavage. However, when the 7-nt binding arms of the enzyme were modified with five 2 0 -OMe or three LNA moieties, complete cleavage of the target was observed under single turnover conditions.

Clearly, more biochemical and structural data are needed to disentangle the contributions of individual nucleotides, metal ions, and water molecules in the active sites of DNA catalysts.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions and Future Perspectives"}, {"text": "With respect to applications as therapeutic agents, the efficiency of DNA catalysts compares well with other nucleic acid-based strategies to downregulate protein expression, but, at the same time, faces similar difficulties as well. However, unlike in the case of other DNA-or RNA-based therapeutic agents, detailed pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies are yet to be conducted for RNAcleaving DNA enzymes. To increase the in vivo efficiency, promising developments can currently be found in recent in vitro selection attempts that strive to improve the tolerance for low divalent metal ion concentrations by expanding the chemical diversity of DNA nucleotides. Modified nucleotide modifications will also serve effectively for enhancing the lifetime of DNA enzymes under the demanding conditions encountered in biological environments. Together with modern strategies for delivery of modified DNA enzymes, it can be expected that deoxyribozymes may find their way to clinic in the near future. Even though RNAcleaving DNA enzymes have not yet made it to real-life therapeutic applications, they have been serving the scientific community as valuable research tools to address biochemical, biomedical, and bioanalytical problems.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions and Future Perspectives"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "DNAzymes: from
