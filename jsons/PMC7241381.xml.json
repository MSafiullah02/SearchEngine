After the declaration of national emergency in the USA (March 13th), and face-to-face encounters were reduced to minimal numbers by week 2 and more than 98% of outpatient care was provided via teleneurology. However, the total number of outpatient encounters was reduced almost by 40\u201350% in both health systems. At Yale School of Medicine such reduction in volume was secondary to reduction in the number of new patient evaluations. While a detailed breakdown report was not available from Johns Hopkins, a similar reason can be presumed. As tertiary medical centers, both institutions receive a significant number of referrals from a wide territory. Such referrals often demand detailed physical examinations and thorough scrutiny of previous records, and the former was not possible during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, resources from the outpatient clinic, including support staff, were relocated to more critical needs, which also may have affected the process of streamlining new appointments [5].",
