Impaired function of the immune system might lead to serious diseases which are often treated by immunomodulators. This chapter briefl y explores the physiology of an important part of the lymphatic system, the gutassociated lymphoid tissues (GALT). Currently used strategies for targeting GALT by immunomodulators for enhanced activity and/or decreased side effects are discussed. Strategies range from simple oral co-administration of immunomodulators with lipids to more advanced lipid-based formulations, polymer-based nanoparticle formulations and prodrugs. These targeting approaches successfully increase the concentration of immunomodulators achieved in the GALT and, more importantly, enhance immunomodulatory effects. Therefore, targeting immunomodulators to GALT represent a promising approach in the treatment of diseases where the immune system is actively involved.",

In the fourth century B.C., components of the lymph system, particularly the auxiliary lymph nodes, were fi rst described by Hippocrates as 'vessels containing white blood' [ 1 ] . However, it was not until the sixteenth century A.D. when the Italian physician Aselli succeeded to describe the lymphatic system in the gut of fed dogs. This discovery was made accidentally while trying to observe the diaphragm. He noticed a network of vessels containing milky white fl uid that he later named 'lacteal vessels'. However, Aselli suggested that these vessels deliver their contents to the liver. It took many decades until the French physician Pecquet identifi ed the thoracic ducts and proved that these ducts receive fl ow from the lacteals discovered by Aselli [ 1 -4 ] . More accurate anatomical descriptions were developed later, using wax injections to uncover parts of the system. This included the discovery of lymph nodules in the mucous membrane of the small intestine, Peyer's patches (PP), which were named after their discoverer Johann Conrad Peyer [ 1 , 3 ] .",

            "text": "Accurate functional description of the discovered structures was not proposed until the publication of William Hunter's research. It was suggested in this research that lymphatics and lacteals are structural units of one large system distributed in all remote parts of the body [ 1 -3 ] . Indeed, the lymphatic system was thought to be merely a drainage system for fl uids and proteins from interstitial space back to the blood [ 5 ] . Currently, however, the lymphatic system is considered to have a central role in the pathogenesis of several diseases such as cancers, viral infections, some parasitic infections and autoimmune disorders. In fact, it is the main pathway for the metastases of some epithelial origin solid tumours, such as those of the colon, breasts, lungs and prostate [ 6 ] . In addition, the lymphatic system is now recognised as a crucial part of the immune system. It is here where invader antigens are trapped, processed and presented to immune cells and consequently where immune responses are evoked [ 1 ] . These responses are important for the protection of the body from bacterial, viral, parasitic and fungal threats, as well as the growth of tumour cells [ 7 ] . Defi ciencies in the immune responses, whether inherited or acquired, weaken the body's defence mechanisms. On the other hand, over-reactive immune responses might cause life-threatening diseases, commonly called autoimmune diseases. Therefore, substances that can positively or negatively modify weak or over-reactive immune responses, respectively, provide a novel approach in the treatment of disorders where the immune system has a central role. These substances are collectively referred to as immunomodulators [ 8 ] .",

The fi rst step in the absorption of dietary lipids is their digestion and micellar solubilisation in the gastrointestinal lumen. This happens mainly by the action of pancreatic lipase/co-lipase complex and bile salts in the small intestine. Once digested, the products of lipid hydrolysis are then incorporated into mixed micelles, which promote the diffusion of digested lipids to the apical membrane of enterocytes [ 13 ] . Inside enterocytes, most of the long-chain triglycerides (LCT) are resynthesised from long-chain fatty acids and monoglycerides, mainly by the action of acyltransferases. LCT are then assembled with apolipoprotein B (Apo B), phospholipids, cholesterol and cholesterol esters to form large lipoproteins with a lipid core (chylomicrons, CM). Mature CM are then secreted by exocytosis through the basolateral membrane of enterocytes. Being large particles, CM cannot pass the walls of vascular capillaries but are absorbed to the lymph lacteals instead [ 14 -17 ] . Because of the presence of lipids in the form of CM, lymph fl uid following high-fat meal looks like a turbid emulsion which is commonly called 'chyle' [ 6 ] .",

GALT is also exposed to more antigens than any other part of the body, in the form of commensal bacteria and alimentary antigens, in addition to those from invasive pathogens. The intestinal immune system must therefore be able to distinguish antigens that require a protective immune response and to develop a state of immune hypo-responsiveness (oral tolerance) for those antigens that are harmless to the body [ 27 , 30 , 32 ] . The mechanism governing this process involves sampling of luminal antigens in the intestinal epithelium by DC. Antigens can cross the epithelium through M-cells that are found in the FAE of PP. The antigens can then interact with DC in the underlying subepithelial dome region. Antigens are then presented to local T-cells in PP by DC. DC can also migrate to the draining MLN where they present antigens to local lymphocytes [ 23 , 27 , 30 , 38 ] . Alternative pathways for antigen transport across the intestinal epithelial cells involve receptor-mediated transport, as well as direct sampling from the lumen by DC's projections. Antigen-loaded DC then migrate to the MLN through afferent lymphatics where they present antigens to T-cells. Subsequently, differentiated lymphocytes migrate from MLN through the thoracic duct and blood stream and eventually accumulate in the mucosa for an appropriate immune response ( Fig. 14. 1 ) [ 27 , 39 ] .",

The lymphatic system is a main pathway of intestinal tumour metastases; therefore, targeting cytotoxic drugs to the intestinal lymphatics could provide advantage in the treatment of tumour metastases [ 40 , 41 ] . Being the largest lymphatic organ, GALT provide a valid delivery target for antiviral agents, as some viruses spread and develop within the lymphatic system.

This primarily occurs as a result of enhancing micellar solubilisation of the drug in the small intestine and drug-CM association in enterocytes [ 43 ] . One important reason is that intestinal lymphatic transport avoids hepatic fi rst-pass metabolic loss by diverting the absorption of lipophilic drugs towards intestinal lymphatics rather than the portal vein, which is extremely important for drugs exhibiting signifi cant fi rst-pass metabolism [ 16 ] . \u2022 Intestinal lymphatic transport of lipophilic drugs results in delivery of the drug to the systemic circulation in CM-associated form, which might attenuate the pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic properties [ 41 , 44 ] .",

Miura et al. also demonstrated that the enhancement of lymphocyte fl ux was selective to the administration of the long-chain but not the medium-chain fatty acids. This in turn was secondary to the assembly of CM by enterocytes to enhance the absorption of orally administered long-chain fatty acids, as the co-administration of Pluronic l -81 (an inhibitor of intracellular CM transport and secretion) signifi cantly decreased lymphocyte transport (Fig. 14.2 ) . Moreover, the effect of long-chain fatty acids (particularly the monounsaturated fatty acids) was not limited to the augmentation of lymphocyte fl ux, but also stimulated lymphocyte proliferation. The precise mechanism governing these effects is unclear. However, a mechanism that involves the utilisation of CM's phospholipids and fatty acids has been suggested [ 37 , 45 ] . This view is supported by the observations by Calder et al. [ 46 ] who found that lymphocytes have lipoprotein lipase activities and are able to release fatty acids from triglycerides (TG) present in CM and very low-density lipoproteins. In addition, the study also showed that TG rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) such as linoleic acid are potent inhibitors of lymphocyte proliferation in vitro, while this effect was not observed when using the monounsaturated oleic acid. This can in part explain the clinical benefi ts of daily administration of vegetable oils containing linoleic acid to patients suffering from infl ammatory and autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and multiple sclerosis [ 46 , 47 ] . Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that targeting of immunomodulators to GALT could present a valid treatment strategy for a wide range of serious diseases.",

Bile acids are hydrophilic on one end and hydrophobic on the other, whereas phospholipids generally have one hydrophilic tail and two hydrophobic tails (two fatty acids). These amphiphilic surfactants emulsify the lipids to form a fi ne emulsion, which prevents the droplets from aggregating back into larger particles.

Due to the hydrophobic nature of this core, highly lipophilic drugs are very good candidates to be transported via this pathway.

This drug is an investigational lipophilic cannabinoid 2 (CB 2 ) receptor agonist that has immunomodulatory effects [ 58 ] and therapeutic benefi ts in animal model of multiple sclerosis [ 59 ] . Cannabinoids in general are a group of chemical compounds that act on cannabinoid receptors and have been reported to have immunomodulatory effects [ 60 ] . In a study by Trevaskis et al. [ 18 ] , the intestinal lymphatic transport and the recovery of JWH-015 in the collected lymph lymphocytes were assessed in mesenteric lymph duct-cannulated rats following intraduodenal infusion with oleic acid. In this study, JWH-015 was administered in lipid formulations containing either 4 or 40 mg oleic acid. The authors concluded that proportions of JWH-015 doses recovered in the mesenteric lymph and lymphocytes were signifi cantly higher (53 and 176 fold, respectively) following the administration of 40 compared to 4 mg oleic acid formulations. Although lymphocyte fl ux into the mesenteric lymph was elicited by as low as 4 mg oleic acid, high lipid formulation (40 mg oleic acid) increased lymphocyte fl ux up to fi vefold. Thus, in this study, co-administration of JWH-015 with long-chain fatty acids affected GALT's lymphocytes by three mechanisms: enhancement of drug absorption from the intestinal lumen, stimulation of the intestinal lymphatic transport of the drug and increase in lymphocyte fl ux to the area. Furthermore, Trevaskis et al. compared the lymphatic transport of JWH-015 to that of other model lipophilic molecules, namely, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), halofantrine, ciclosporin and diazepam which are insecticidal, antimalarial, immunosuppressant and central nervous system depressant drugs, respectively. The magnitude of the intestinal lymphatic transport correlated with the lipophilicity and TG solubility of these drugs. The results showed that the extent of intestinal lymphatic transport was enhanced when the drug was co-administered with 40 compared to 4 mg oleic acid for all drugs (Fig. 14.3 ) .",

However, ciclosporin has very low solubility in water (23 \u03bcg/mL at 20 \u00b0C) and is also extensively metabolised by cytochrome P-450 enzymes [ 68 -71 ] . Substantial research has been done about formulating ciclosporin into emulsions containing lipid microspheres [ 67 ] or milk fat globule membranes [ 65 ] . Since its approval for use, a number of different formulations of ciclosporin became commercially available, many of which are emulsions, the most common being Sandimmune \u00ae and its newer formulation Neoral \u00ae [ 65 ] . Ciclosporin is an important candidate for intestinal lymphatic transport, since it is highly metabolised in the liver into metabolites with lower immunosuppressive activity [ 69 , 70 ] . Sandimmune \u00ae , the original formulation of ciclosporin, vastly improved its bioavailability but had high inter-and intrapatient variability. Therefore, an optimised formulation consisting of dl-\u03b1tocopherol, corn oil derivatives and polyoxyl 40 hydrogenated castor oil, named Neoral \u00ae , was tested and resulted in more predictable pharmacokinetic profi les and more extensive drug absorption [ 65 , 72 , 73 ] .",

SNEDDS are made from very similar components to other emulsions but are distinct in that they are not thermodynamically stable (but kinetically stable), which means that emulsifi cation of SNEDDS is not as affected by temperature and dilution, but the emulsion will separate into different phases after prolonged storage [ 74 -76 ] . In their work, Zhang et al. conjugated a phospholipid complex to morin in addition to incorporation into SNEDDS to increase its intestinal permeability and examined the intestinal absorption and lymphatic transport of their SNEDDS compared to conjugated drug and free drug. The group showed that SNEDDS were found in the GALT after oral administration, particularly from the segments closer to the ileum, due to the presence of PP and M-cells [ 74 ] .",

The group went on to study gene expression in mice after oral administration of liposomes containing plasmid DNA encoding green fl uorescent protein and found that liposomal delivery of plasmid DNA yielded much higher gene expression in the draining mesenteric lymph nodes than mice given naked plasmid DNA. The authors concluded that liposomes could be useful agents in lymphatic delivery of DNA [ 94 ] .",

This can be achieved by a mechanism that involves the association of the prodrug with CM assembled in enterocytes. Therefore, a prodrug can be designed to have certain physicochemical properties, particularly log D 7.4 \u2265 5 and high lipid solubility [ 16 , 126 ] , so that its intestinal lymphatic transport is enhanced when the prodrug is co-administered orally with LCT. Alternatively, a prodrug can be structured to be incorporated in one of the biochemical steps of lipid digestion processes.

[ 128 ] described the synthesis of lipophilic prodrugs to promote the delivery of mycophenolic acid (MPA), a model immunomodulator, to the GALT after oral administration with oleic acid. The lipophilicity of MPA (log P 2.9) was increased by the synthesis of long-chain ester prodrug (MPA-C18E, log P 12.4) and long-chain amide prodrug (MPA-C18AM, log P 11.2). Oral administration of MPA-C18E and MPA-C18AM to mesenteric lymph duct-cannulated rats resulted in a 13-and 6-fold increase in lymphatic transport, respectively, compared to the parent compound. This approach enhanced the partitioning of alkyl chain prodrugs to CM and thereby promoted lymphatic transport. However, the least lipophilic medium-chain ester prodrug (MPA-C8E) did not increase the recovery of parent compound in lymph. In the same study, a TG-mimicking prodrug of MPA (2-MPA-TG, log P 17.8) was synthesised. The TG-mimicking prodrug leads to an 80-fold increase in lymphatic transport by a mechanism that involves the incorporation of the prodrug in TG hydrolysis-reacylation and CM assembly pathway. The authors suggested that metabolic instability and poor absorption were behind low lymphatic concentrations of alkyl prodrugs relative to TG-mimicking prodrug (Fig. 14.5 ).",

If delivered to the GALT, these immunomodulators have potential to signifi cantly improve future opportunities to treat these disorders. Examples of such molecules are statins which are widely used in clinical practice as cholesterol-lowering agents. Animal models of autoimmune diseases have shown that statins have therapeutic immunomodulatory effects in the treatment of multiple sclerosis [ 129 -131 ] , rheumatoid arthritis [ 132 , 133 ] , autoimmune myocarditis [ 134 ] and autoimmune uveitis [ 135 ] . However, doses of statins used in these experiments were higher than those usually used in humans. Thus, using an appropriate strategy to target GALT, statins might achieve suffi cient concentrations to produce therapeutic immunomodulatory effects while inducing less systemic adverse effects in off-target tissues. In fact, researchers have used lipid-based formulations like SEDDS [ 136 ] , SMEDDS [ 137 ] , SNEDDS [ 138 ] , SLN [ 139 ] and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC, mentioned below) [ 140 ] to improve the oral bioavailability of statins, yet neither intestinal lymphatic transport nor immunomodulatory effects were assessed upon the administration of these formulations. Therefore, it is tempting to suggest that statins might have new therapeutic applications if properly targeted to GALT in patients with autoimmune diseases.",

One worth mentioning is nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC). After the development and success of SLN, a number of problems were identifi ed. Using a single type of solid lipid in the core of SLN led to the formation of a crystalline lattice over time that potentially reduced drugloading capacity [ 100 ] . Gelation of SLN also occurred after prolonged storage [ 101 ] and NLC were created as a way to reduce these problems. NLC use a mixture of solid and liquid lipids to create an imperfect core environment so there is more space to accommodate drugs, while still maintaining a solid state [ 104 , 150 ] . It can therefore be said that NLC are a second-generation lipid-based nanoparticle formulation [ 100 ] . Due to the relatively new development of NLC, there has not been as extensive study into the targeting of NLC to the GALT, but research has begun in assessment for their targeting potential. One work studied the oral administration of NLC loaded with a lipophilic vasodilator [ 150 ] . The oral administration of these NLC resulted in a threefold increase in bioavailability of the loaded drug compared to an aqueous suspension. This suggests that NLC activated an alternative absorption pathway, possibly also avoiding fi rst-pass metabolism, a frequent cause of low oral bioavailability for many lipophilic drugs [ 151 ] . It is therefore conceivable that immunomodulators can be loaded in NLC and targeted towards the GALT in a similar fashion.",
