This observation has been supported by numerous animal- and human-based studies conducted using a variety of pathogens.49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75 The virulence of influenza, herpes simplex virus, and the Coxsackie virus, for example, is increased when mice are inoculated before or after being forced to swim or run to exhaustion.52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65 Equine respiratory disease, especially from the influenza virus, is a common infection requiring veterinary medical attention, and intense exercise has been linked to increased susceptibility to influenza disease among horses.71 Exhaustive exercise leading to increased morbidity and mortality from viral infection in animals has been linked to immune dysfunction, including a decrease in macrophage anti-viral resistance and antigen presentation, natural killer cell cytotoxicity, and neutrophil oxidative burst activity.54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65\n",

Clinical and autopsy records of 19 sudden cardiac deaths that occurred among Air Force recruits during basic training showed that the most frequent underlying etiology was myocarditis.74 Viral illness is endemic in barrack-residing recruits, and exertion may have exacerbated viral-induced subclinical cases of myocarditis. A study of 20 male soldiers in the Israel Defense Forces who had died suddenly and unexpectedly within 24 h of strenuous exertion also reasoned that febrile disease might have been a cause of death in some of the subjects.75\n",

When repeated in regular fashion, these transient, exercise-induced increases in anti-pathogenic leukocytes enhance immunosurveillance, reduce illness risk, and lower systemic inflammation. Thus, regular exercise training can be viewed as an immune system adjuvant and is of particular clinical value for obese individuals with comorbidities, as well as for older individuals.95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103\n",

These data indicate that physical fitness and frequency of aerobic exercise are important correlates of reduced days with acute respiratory illness and severity of symptoms during the winter and fall seasons, when common colds are more frequent.
