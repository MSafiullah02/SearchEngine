In this write-up, we will focus on the respiratory manifestations, progression and intensive care management of respiratory complications of COVID-19. As we learn more about the 2019-nCoV (novel coronavirus) and the impact this has had on the patients and health care workers (HCW) globally, the focus has shifted to safety of the HCW so that the patients can be treated appropriately and kept safe. This is based on the lessons learned from previous epidemics and mitigating steps to reduce risks to HCW. Most of the following suggestions are based on expert opinionon providing safe care in these challenging times.",

It is important to recognize the risk factors, categorize severity and provide early treatment. Use of high flow devices and non-invasive ventilation has been discouraged due to high chances of aerosol generation. Early intubation and mechanical ventilation areessential to prevent complications and worsening, especially in resource-limited settings with very few centers having expertise to manage critical cases. Hydrophobic viral filter in the ventilator circuit minimizes chances of transmission of virus. Strategies to manage ARDS in COVID-19 include low tidal volume ventilation with liberal sedation-analgesia. At the same time, prevention of transmission of the virus to healthcare workers is extremely important in the intensive care setting dealing with severe cases and requiring procedures generating aerosol. We, herein, provide guidance on non-invasive respiratory support, intubation and management of ARDS in a child with COVID-19.

At the same time there is paucity of literature regarding the use of NIV in respiratory pandemics. In a Chinese observational study in adults of the SARS outbreak, it was shown that NIV was effective in preventing the use of endotracheal intubation in 70% of patients because of early initiation of NIV. In this study, none of the HCW acquired SARS from the patients. This was attributed to NIV being applied in a negativepressure environment with strict PPE regime and close monitoring of the HCW involved [18] . In another study from Toronto during SARS, the use of NIV was discouraged after clinicians contracted the disease when a patient was intubated following NIV failure [19] . Therefore, some clinicians consider NIV is contra-indicated for acute respiratory failure due to airborne respiratory diseases unless it is used in a negative-pressure isolation room and strict precautions are taken [19] .",

Extubation should be performed if the patient is considered ready for extubating to nasal O2 as post-extubation NIV is avoided where possible.Aerosol precautions are essential during extubation. Few units practice extubating using a plastic bag over the face with a tight seal after inflating with oxygen ( Fig. 4) or some units use a transparent large plastic sheet over the face and chest to capture droplets from coughing and suctioning. Post-extubation, the need for HFNC or NIV can be assessed while reducing monitoring.",
