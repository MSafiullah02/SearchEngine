A further study also demonstrated a powerful association of viral infections with more severe exacerbations of asthma leading to hospital admissions, in both adults and children. There was also a strong relationship between the hospital admission rates in children and school attendance, with a peak in admissions in the first few weeks of each school term 5 \u2022 We have recently studied infants and children admitted to hospital with severe wheezing illness and <0 1997 Wlley-Liss, Inc.",

Detection rates for C. pneumoniae in reported and asymptomatic samples were similar (24% vs 28% respectively) and 47% of children were PCR positive for C. pneumoniae at some stage during the study 10 \u2022 Children positive on any one occasion were likely to be positive again if tested subsequently, suggesting chronic infection. C. pneumoniae-specific slgA antibodies in nasal aspirates were measured by amplified EIA and were seven times greater in subjects who reported 4 or more exacerbations in the study compared to those who reported just one (p<0.02). There was no evidence for a role for M pneumoniae in acute exacerbations of asthma. This study found an unexpectedly high rate of chronic C. pneumoniae infection, and immune responses to C. pneumoniae were positively associated with frequency of asthma exacerbations. The high prevalence of C. pneumoniae was confirmed in children admitted to hospital with bronchiolitis and wheezing illness. We found prevalences of C. pneumoniae infection varying from 18% in those aged less than 3 months, to 58% in those aged over 5 years (Johnston SL, Xie P, Johnson W, unpublished data). The very high prevalence in these children with severe disease also supports a possible pathogenic role for C. pneumoniae infection in asthma symptom severity. Further larger and carefully controlled studies are now required to investigate this possibility.",
