Renowned microbiologists Macfarlane Burnet and David White predicted in 1972 that \u201cthe most likely forecast about the future of infectious diseases is that it will be very dull.\u201d They further admitted that there was always a risk of \u201csome wholly unexpected emergence of a new and dangerous infectious disease\u201d (Burnet and White 1972). True to their prediction, in December 2019, a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause, linked to the local seafood market in Wuhan, capital of Hubei province in China heralded the now global pandemic of SARS-CoV-2, previous called the novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) (Wuhan Municipal Health Commission 2019). It was in February 2020 the Director-General of WHO, Dr. Tedros Ghebreyesus, christened it as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (World Health Organization 2020a). It was isolated from the human airway epithelial cells, and after the viral genomic sequencing was identified as the seventh member of the betacoronavirus family infecting humans, subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, order nidovirales and subgenus Sarbecovirus similar to the SARS virus but different clade with profound similarity to bat coronaviruses (Tan et al. 2020). It is a non-segmented, positive sense, single-stranded RNA virus. After the initial identification of the local cluster of cases in Wuhan, the epidemic peaked in China between late January and early February (WHO 2020a). The virus simultaneously spread rapidly worldwide by community transmission in Italy, Iran, Japan and South Korea and superspreading events affecting many nations across the globe causing the WHO to declare a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) on January 30th 2020 and a global pandemic on 12th March 2020 (WHO 2020b). Understanding of the disease is ever evolving since its emergence. SARS-CoV-2 is a pathogen with a naughty mix of virulence and contagiousness combined with human\u2013animal interaction, urban crowding, global trade and tourism has made it a potential threat to mankind worldwide. Rapid containment of this pandemic needs enhancement of our knowledge regarding its transmission, incubation period, reproducibility, pathogenicity and clinical signs and symptoms and the differential diagnosis.",

SARS-CoV-2 like SARS virus binds to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (hACE-2) located on type II alveolar and intestinal cells (Zhou et al. 2020a). Thus, the major mode of transmission is via airborne large droplets with a risk limited to ~6 ft from the patient (del Rio and Malani 2020). Due to large droplets borne transmission, infection can be prevented from spreading by using surgical face masks and airborne precautions. The other mode of person-to-person transmission is contact transmission via fomites, as the large droplets settle on surface and contaminate it, thus mandate decontamination of fomites and good hand hygiene.",

In the stage of adaptive immunity viral levels decline as immune system takes over, but the inflammatory cytokine storm leads to tissue destruction and clinical deterioration\u2014which explains the phenomenon where patients remain relatively well initially before deteriorating suddenly.

COVID-19 predominantly affects males (58.1%), in particular of Asian ethnicity; this might be due to increased expression of hACE-2 receptor in them and also due to higher rates of smoking which further leads to increased expression of hACE-2 receptor (Cai 2020). But these are just speculations and further studies worldwide involving other ethnicities are needed. The age group affected predominantly are the middle aged and elderly (Median: 47 years; Range: 30\u201379 years), with very few cases reported among children (0.9\u20132%).

Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and vomiting (5%) and diarrhoea (3.8%) were relatively uncommon. Most common symptoms in most cohorts of COVID-19 are fever and cough, and gastrointestinal symptoms are relatively uncommon which differentiates COVID-19 from SARS and MERS.

The median time to onset of dyspnoea from various cohorts was found to be 6 days following exposure. The median time to admission, development of ARDS and need for mechanical ventilation and ICU care was 8, 8.2 and 10 days, respectively. In a study (summarized in Table 6.2) by Zhou et al. (2020b) the median time to discharge from onset of illness was 22 days (IQR: 18\u201325 days), whereas the median time to death was 18\u00b75 days (15\u201322 days). The median duration of fever was 12 days (8\u201313 days) and cough persisted for 19 days (IQR: 12\u201323 days) in survivors. Complications such as bilateral pneumonia followed by ARDS, sepsis and septic shock, acute cardiac injury, acute kidney injury and secondary infection developed at a median of 12 days (8\u201315 days), 9 days (7\u201313 days), 15 days (10\u201317 days), 15 days (13\u201319 days) and 17 days (13\u201319 days). The median duration of viral shedding was 20 days (IQR 17\u201324 days) from illness onset in survivors (Fig. 6.3a) vs. non-survivors (Fig. 6.3b) who continued shedding virus till death. In patients who received anti-retroviral with a median time of 14 days to their initiation, the median duration of viral shedding was 22 days (18\u201324 days). The median duration of viral shedding was 19 days (17\u201322 days) and 24 days (22\u201330 days) in patients with severe disease and critical disease, respectively.\n\n\n\n",

Complications are more in severe disease vs. non-severe disease. In the study cohort of 1099 COVID-19 cases by Guan et al. (2020), bilateral pneumonia (91.1%) occurred most commonly followed by ARDS (3.4%), septic shock (1.1%), AKI (0.5%) and coagulopathy (0.1%). In this cohort 926 (84%) had non-severe and 173 (16%) had severe disease. Underlying co-morbidities were more common among patients with severe disease than among non-severe disease (38.7% vs. 21.0%). Outcomes were as follows: 55 (5%) were discharged, 15 (1.4%) died, 9 (0.8%) recovered and 1029 (93.6%) remain hospitalized as of March 6, 2020. Overall mortality associated with COVID as of March 1, 2020, as estimated by the WHO, is 3.6% in China and 1.5% outside China. The mortality of COVID-19 (Fig. 6.4) is much less than that of SARS (9.6%) and MERS (34%). Case fatality rate of COVID-19 ranges from 5.8% in Wuhan to 0.7% in China. It is higher in elderly >70 years (8\u201315%). Overall case fatality is 2.3% (WHO 2020c). In most of the people with COVID-19, almost >80% have mild illness (Wu and McGoogan 2020).\n",
