By examining the policy implications of the key narratives around public health, animal health and trade, it becomes possible to clarify the relationship between global understandings of infectious disease risk and their impact on the development of local responses to disease problems. We highlight the tensions that resource-constrained countries face in the nexus of animal health-public health and trade, including the perception that resource-constrained countries are both source and victims of potential infectious disease threats. Given this scenario, it is important to think about how developing countries, particularly those in Sub-Saharan Africa, can approach infectious disease risk management as it relates to pandemic scale threats such as avian and pandemic influenza. We outline some of the key considerations in defining and assessing disease risk using avian and pandemic influenza in Zambia as an example. We conclude that the key to the feasibility of the analysis of the risk of multi-sectoral affecting emerging infectious diseases such as zoonotic avian influenza is flexibility in how risk is framed across the public health, animal health and trade systems.",

The human-animal interface is the nexus that permits the cross-species transmission of infectious agents and is represented by a continuum of contacts between humans and animals, either directly or indirectly through their products and their shared environments.2 \u2018The human-animal interface\u20193 is thus a term that encompasses the wider socio-economic and biological influences of disease transmission and spread, elements which are fundamental to the examination of human-animal infectious disease management. It is the human-animal interface that has arbitrated the transmission of zoonotic diseases and the introduction of novel pathogens into new geographical areas and novel host species. However, while its role in disease transmission is not new, because of globalization, its current ecological dimensions are of a completely different order of magnitude.4 In essence, modern industrialized society is an important source of the expanded ecological pressure at the human-animal interface. The human-animal interface therefore provides an important conceptual framework for the examination of the public and animal health risks of animal-sourced epidemics, and through health policy, their relationship with risk enabling anthropogenic activities. These risk enabling activities include changes in land use, livestock production, chosen routes for economic growth and trade promotion; activities that both foster and enhance zoonosis transmission.5\n",

Health proponents argue that health compromises continue to be made. Meirianos and Peires,33 for example, maintain that the revised IHRs made trade-offs between national sovereignty and global health by attempting to guard against global disease spread with minimum interference to trade and travel.

Perhaps to nudge the animal health camp in particular to align more closely to public health propositions, it has been suggested that the OIE regulations, the animal health counterpart to the IHRs, require a similar revision to better align them with the present-day threats presented by trans-boundary diseases.34 No attempt has been made to overhaul the OIE regulations, but the international animal health community appears to be moving closer to health by adopting a global perspective on the control of zoonoses.35 Simultaneously, the international animal health community has taken an active pro-trade stance in their address of issues surrounding trade and health protection. The OIE has been setting international animal health standards for purposes of facilitating safe trade in livestock and livestock products of trade under the Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Agreement of the WTO in its Terrestrial Animal Health Code.36 Thus countries that are involved in livestock and livestock product trade are expected to comply with the SPS Agreement in order to reap the full benefits of international commerce.37 Pushing a free trade agenda, Zepeda et al.38 uphold (the SPS regulation) that public health measures to ensure food safety and to control plant or animal diseases should be based, as far as is appropriate, on international standards, presumably freeing them from having to justify their animal health policies through analyses of \u2018risk\u2019. The SPS Agreement espouses the view that measures to protect public health, animal health and plant health should only minimally interfere with trade. It is this \u2018clause\u2019, similarly adopted under the revised IHRs, that has been found to be problematic at national level.39 Pragmatically, this also demonstrates both the increasing interaction of different areas of international policy in fostering of commercial interests within international health and agriculture.",

However, when threats such as zoonotic diseases are global rather than local, the vagaries of context, institutions and culture play important roles in the construction of such events as risks, elements that are not exogenous to the technical-scientific processes of risk analysis. This empirical section is based on a policy study that examined the avian and pandemic influenza policy process in Zambia over the 2005\u20132009 period to suggest a pragmatic way of increasing the efficacy of risk analysis methodology in guiding livestock trade decisions and multi-sectoral disease risk management in resource-constrained contexts. Using the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) risk analysis framework as an illustration, we demonstrate how the cross-cutting and highly contingent nature of today\u2019s infectious disease threats provide learning points for re-conceptualizing the use of risk analysis to inform policy, to better account for the institutional and social phenomena that frame both risk perception and management.

For instance, Urlich Beck59 in his seminal book Risk Society introduces the theory of reflexive modernization in which the processes of modernity in industrialized societies are posited to be the cause of the emergence of unprecedented and indeterminate risks and hazards, including those presented by infectious diseases. Some of these modernization processes were alluded to earlier, when we discussed the factors that have led to the emergence of infectious diseases. Within this body of work, risk creation, construction and response are intrinsically linked to modernization, and knowledge and science are argued to play a constitutive and sometimes unexamined role in these processes. Beck\u2019s views share commonalities with those of another renown sociologist, Anthony Giddens.60 In Giddens\u201961 conception of reflexive modernization, the increasing dependence on society\u2019s \u2018experts\u2019 to determine what is and how to respond to \u2018risk\u2019 in societies, has brought with it risk\u2019s polar opposite, uncertainty. Risk analysis, for instance, is a process of creating scenarios of risk which are based on contingent scientific knowledge and is therefore subject to change. Uncertainty arises when risk cannot be precisely calculated, e.g. when the probability of occurrence of adverse events are unknown or inestimable.62 Uncertainty and surprise, in turn, have led to concerns over the validity of purely scientific responses to risk.63\n",

Another concern is a lack of robustness in this approach\u2019s dealing with the ambiguities of scientific uncertainty and surprise137 and, a failure to fully engage political processes and social choices in addressing risk.138 One solution is \u201cto develop a more holistic perspective\u201d of risk \u201cthat includes explicit consideration of the roles of policy, disease management, and feedbacks between ecosystems and societies.\u201d139\n",

However, as part of the OIE framework, the OIE\u2019s veterinary services evaluation process sets as a benchmark independence from political influence.145 This separation is impractical. Furthermore, the veterinary profession is potentially limited by this dependence on scientific or authoritative opinion and its exclusion of political and social phenomena.146 Political and contextual dimensions are just as important as the biological considerations when it comes to the multi-sectoral risk management of emerging, albeit limited zoonosis such as H5N1.147 As discussed in our case study on Zambia, there were differences in the understanding of risk among sectors at the interface of animal health, public health and trade.

This is hazard identification, defined by the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code as \u201cthe process of identifying the pathogenic agents which could potentially be introduced in the commodity149 considered for importation\u201d.150 A hazard is defined as \u201cany pathogenic agent that could produce adverse consequences on the importation of a commodity.\u201d151 This is the technical definition, but there is also a policy equivalent of hazard identification that could be factored into the risk analysis. In a policy sense, hazard identification is the framing of the problem. This is not simply how the agent, for instance, H5N1 avian influenza, is conceptualised, but also how it is perceived, as a problem, i.e. its social construction. Perceptions of H5N1 risk were constructed by different international and national policy agendas and evidence in Zambia. Cognisance of these sometimes conflicting interactions in perceptions of risk could potentially enhance the applicability of the OIE risk analysis framework in the context of a country such as Zambia.

These different animal health, trade and economy, and public health framings of the H5N1 problem formed the internal policy response, bringing specific actors to the policy process. The resulting policy framework then addressed four contiguous disease and disease management issues. First, there was the root consideration of H5N1 (or H5N1 emergency preparedness) second, there was the consideration of general avian influenzas, third, there was the aspect of human seasonal influenzas and fourth, there was the core policy issue of human influenza pandemic preparedness and capacity building.

In the context of Zambia and H5N1, at least, there were various technical and non-technical strands to the preparedness effort as it related to the management of H5N1 risk; the public health response, based on the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) framework; the animal health response, guided by a National Response Plan and also the omitted, but potentially important, trade response, based on their capacity to translate, support or implement trade agreements for the purpose of animal health, plant health or human health protection.173 It would be unrealistic to expect that \u2018risk managers\u2019 in these different policy communities would have \u201cthe appropriate level of technical background to communicate effectively with risk assessors.\u201d174\n",

Risk analysis\u2019 role in informing decision making would be enhanced if risk is considered across the entire policy spectrum and not just from one viewpoint. In this endeavor, a risk analyst should understand that in multi-sectoral settings, there are differences in priorities, norms and policy frameworks which can impact upon the development of a risk management policy. Such challenges include properly linking the risk management policy response to livestock trade and holistically addressing the various conceivable modes of disease introduction and routes for human exposure. The purpose of this exercise is to bring different stakeholders to view risk management in mutually inclusive ways. The risk management process should therefore draw both on multiple framings of risk and the resources of a wide pool of policy relevant stakeholders, to aid the process of assigning roles and resources more appropriately across sectors.",

The OIE Code defines risk communication as \u201cthe interactive transmission and exchange of information and opinions throughout the risk analysis process concerning risk, risk-related factors and risk perceptions among risk assessors, risk managers, risk communicators, the general public and other interested parties\u201d.175 For the OIE risk analysis to be useful, there has to be a consideration of who the policy relevant risk communicators are for a given risk problem in a given context. There is need to also think about how risk is communicated to, and by, different policy stakeholders, including the public, the media, farmers, medics, veterinarians, decision-makers across different sectors and even the donor community. Equally important is that in the process of risk communication, a context appropriate forum is used, allowing for as much dialogue and feedback in the risk analysis process as possible. Such a risk analysis process would derive most benefit if presented both on a forum capable of reaching the largest number of policy relevant stakeholders and in ways that engages the interests of each policy relevant stakeholder. This entails structuring risk in flexible and stakeholder inclusive ways across public health, animal health, trade and more widely. Such a forum and approach would provide an audit of the multi-sectoral zoonosis risk management policy, including the identification of the institutions, resources and policies available for risk management. More importantly, it would be able to mobilize the necessary resources and institutions to enforce and evaluate the risk management response.",

Therefore, the key to the feasibility of the analysis of the risk of multi-sectoral affecting emerging infectious diseases such as avian and pandemic influenza is flexibility in how risk is framed across the public health, animal health and trade systems. This requires taking explicit notice of multiple risk framings from a diverse cross-section of stakeholders, to better negotiate risk analysis and risk management. Based on the understanding that risk is socially constructed, we argued that in the process of hazard identification, it is the recognition of the various framing assumptions that construct the risk in each context that will help foster wider stakeholder inclusion. This, in turn, will take into account the multiple perspectives that exist in resource-constrained countries.",

Furthermore, by acknowledging these framing assumptions throughout the various stages of the risk analysis process, a better map of the local risk management context can be developed that examines both the scientific aspects of local configuration and the politics of policy processes.",

By analysing the feasibility of the applicability of the OIE risk analysis framework through a policy lens, this chapter attempted to demonstrate that given the interactions between local context, risk assessment and risk management policy, the relationship between policy and risk cannot be viewed as linear.
