The most recent estimates of the effects of the pandemic describe a scenario that none of us have ever seen: Demand for hospital beds in the United States will exceed capacity by 64 175 acute care beds and 17 309 intensive care beds; over the next 4 months, clinicians are projected to witness 81 114 deaths (1). These statistics, though, are merely a 30 000-foot view of the territory that clinicians are seeing now, as they grapple with patients and families on the ground about how to prepare, what is happening, and what to expect.",

Delivering serious news and discussing goals of care still work as heuristics for COVID-19 -related illness (2), although clinicians will face an extra measure of COVID-19related apprehension, uncertainty, and fear. But clinicians are also being confronted with new communication tasks that none of us have faced before, including proactive COVID-19 planning for patients who are already frail with other serious illnesses, facilitating virtual goodbyes between family members and dying patients with restricted access, and explaining decisions on why a particular patient will not receive a scarce resource.",

Our approach, which has shown positive outcomes in clinician behavior (4), patient quality of life (5), and patient trust (6), is based on 3 core principles. First, dealing with emotion is more important than giving lots of information. Unless we acknowledge the fear, sadness, and anxiety that patients and families experience, they will not absorb the information they need. Second, information is best delivered in small packets that start with a headline. When we embed bad news in a long, technical medical narrative, our patients lose the thread and miss the news.",

Under crisis standards, the ethical foundation shifts from individual values to population-based resource allocation that maximizes the most good for the largest number of people (7) . Clinicians should become familiar with their state standards, which differ somewhat across the United States. When systems and clinicians are operating under crisis standards, patients will not have some choices. Triage committees will make decisions for patients that may hasten death. In these circumstances, clinicians will need to shift away from the third principle. Instead of eliciting values that drive care, clinicians will need to explain the care that is possible, refrain from offering treatments or interventions that aren't available for that patient, and instead share what crisis standards mean for them (Figure) . This does not require that clinicians stop listening, stop talking about what's important, or stop empathizing-those skills will be more important than ever. But in a crisis, the third principle must yield.",

For us, the COVID-19 pandemic has evoked feelings that we haven't visited since the first phase of AIDS: huge uncertainty, deep vulnerability, and gruesome anecdotes. Yet back then, we were also humbled and inspired by clinicians who stepped up heroically to care for those first HIV-positive patients (9) , and that personal experience shaped much of the work in communication we do now. Our hope is that the attention we bring to the communication that lies at the heart of clinical care could enable us and our colleagues to emerge from this pandemic with more wisdom and kindness. For patients and families, we hope that care from a clinician who communicates their caring could mitigate a measure of the suspicion and mistrust that seems likely to be another legacy of COVID-19.",
