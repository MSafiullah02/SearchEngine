            "text": "While traditional microbiological methods continue to play an important role in determining the causes of respiratory tract infections, nucleic acid detection tests are now the diagnostic tools of choice for many respiratory pathogens. These advanced diagnostics offer several advantages over the traditional methods (Murdoch et al., 2012, Murdoch et al., 2010); they may be adapted to include additional targets as needed, can simultaneously detect multiple organisms, have the capacity to detect organisms that would be otherwise difficult to identify due to being fastidious, less viable or present only in very small amounts, can quantify the amount of organism in the sample, and can measure pathogen load (Bhat et al., 2012). Several commercial and in-house assays are now available that detect multiple pathogens, but there are limited published studies of head-to-head comparisons (Sakthivel et al, 2012). Here we present an evaluation of the commercial Fast-track Diagnostics\u00ae Respiratory 21 Kit (Fast-track Diagnostics, Luxembourg), a real-time multiplex PCR assay, and a TaqMan array card (TAC, formerly Taqman Low-Density Array or TLDA) (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), a real-time multiple uniplex PCR platform produced by the National Center for Respiratory Diseases, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (Kodani et al., 2011). The evaluation came about as part of an assessment for a diagnostic platform for the Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH), a large multi-center, standardized, case control study of the etiology of severe and very severe pneumonia in five African and two Asian countries (Adegbola and Levine, 2011).",

Because our ultimate goal was to evaluate the assays for their potential use in a large field based epidemiologic study, we also wished to assess their performance in the evaluation of true clinical specimens. Therefore, we also evaluated a set of specimens obtained from children with respiratory illnesses, as described below.",

Samples contained viruses of known quantities (samples 1\u201327, 37\u201342), known dilutions (samples 28\u201336), or both (samples 43\u201345) spiked in pooled nasal wash from healthy adults who had undergone physical examination demonstrating them to be free of respiratory symptoms and who were otherwise healthy as assessed by physical examination and screening laboratory tests. Sample concentration was confirmed by a combination of the following: use of a turbometer followed by confirmation with colony counts, plaque assays, and TCID50 methods. Five samples of nasal wash from healthy adults were not spiked with viruses and served as negative controls (samples 46\u201350). Part two of the panel (samples 51\u201381) included viruses, bacteria, and viral/bacterial mixtures of known quantities (samples 51\u201354, 62, 72, 73), dilutions (samples 55\u201361), or both (samples 68\u201371, 74\u201381) spiked into phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and an additional five negative controls consisting of PBS alone (samples 63\u201367). The panel was designed to evaluate the sensitivity of the assays within a range of pathogen concentrations commonly found in clinical specimens, and to assess potential inhibition due to matrix effects in nasal wash specimens. Panel design also took into consideration the limits of detection previously published for TAC (Kodani et al., 2011) as we well as those reported by the Fast Track manufacturer (ranging from 102 to 104\n copies/mL, with an average limit of detection of 5.20 \u00d7 103\n copies/mL). Samples containing combinations of 2 or 3 pathogens were included in the second part of the panel to simulate mixed infections. In total, the panel contained 48 single pathogen samples, 23 mixed pathogen samples, and 10 negative controls.",

It was demonstrated that both platforms could reliably detect clinically relevant concentrations of bacterial and viral pathogens spiked in nasal wash or buffer as well as individual pathogens present in mixed samples. Inter-assay agreement did not vary significantly when different nucleic acid extraction methods were used in comparison to the clinical specimen evaluation where nucleic acid extraction was held constant. Most importantly, the head-to-head evaluation described here provided a direct comparison of the two platforms that were unavailable elsewhere, and confirmed that either platform would be appropriate for detecting important pathogens from respiratory specimens. Since the time of this evaluation, both platforms have been adapted to include additional pathogen targets and both have been adopted for use in multi-center field based etiology studies among infants and children. The TAC platform has some operational advantages in that individual reactions can be updated without having to optimize multiplexed panels, there is a low sample volume requirement, and minimal pipetting steps are involved. An advantage of the FTD platform is the ability to use less specialized and more widely available real-time PCR equipment.",
