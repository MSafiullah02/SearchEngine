The adoption of social distancing and heavy lockdown measures is posing a heavy burden on the population and the economy. The timing of the measures has crucial policy-making implications. Using publicly available data for the pandemic progression in Italy, we quantitatively assess the effect of the intervention time on the pandemic expansion, with a methodology that combines a generalized susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model together with statistical learning methods. The modeling shows that the lockdown has strongly deviated the pandemic trajectory in Italy. However, the difference between the forecasts and real data up to 20 April 2020 can be explained only by the existence of a time lag between the actual issuance date and the full effect of the measures. To understand the relative importance of intervention with respect to other factors, a thorough uncertainty quantification of the model predictions is performed. Global sensitivity indices show that the the time of intervention is 4 times more relevant than quarantine, and eight times more important than intrinsic features of the pandemic such as protection and infection rates. The relevance of their interactions is also quantified and studied. * The authors contributed equally to this work.",

            "text": "The COVID-19 epidemic initially developed in the Chinese region of Wuhan [1] before becoming a pandemic. As of public records on 21 April 2020, 2,478,634 people have been affected internationally, and more than 26% of the world population is involved in some form of shelter-in-place or lockdown order. In the public political debate and in the scientific debate as well, great attention is posed on the effectiveness of intervention measures. Time-wise, Italy has been one of the first Countries, after China and Iran, significantly hit by the pandemic and then forced to resort to the implementation of strictly increasing quarantine measures by an exponential increase in the COVID-19 infection. The situation in Italy up to the first half of March is well described in [2, 3] . Embracing the recommendations of the scientific experts (see also the considerations in [2] concerning the exponential growth of the epidemic at the beginning of March 2020), since March 08 and March 09 2020 the local (Lombardy) and national (Italy) governments have imposed severe containment measures (lockdown, for simplicity, henceforth). The measures have, indeed, impacted the progression of the epidemic and avoided the exponential growth. On 20 April 2020 Italy counts a total of 181,228 confirmed individuals, with 24,114 deaths and a number of currently infected individuals equal to 108,237. [4] poses the question of how country-based mitigation measures may influence the course of the COVID-19 epidemic world wide. We have seen alternative attitudes internationally, with some countries intervening with strict lockdown measures within a short amount of time since the insurgence of the epidemics, and other adopting a more stage-phased approach.",

A the same time, the intervention time is not be the sole factor explaining a change in the pandemic time progression.

The graphs represents the dynamic evolution of the pandemic comparing real data (circles) against the generalized SEIR model forecast (continuous line). The first graph report the results obtained for the case in which the intervention is modeled as fully active in the first day. We register a poor fit (R 2 = 0.3861), with the forecast largely underestimating the number of totally infected individuals (the root mean squared error (RMSE) is RM SE = 1.7416 \u00d7 10 4 ). The second graph shows reports the comparison in the case the intervention is assumed to have effect 1 day later than the official issuance date. We register better fit, confirmed by an increase of R 2 from 0.3861 to 0.5726 (the RMSE is now 1.4611 \u00d7 10 4 , with a decrease of 16%). Then, graphs (c) to (f) show the effect of simulating the intervention with one additional day of delay per graph. Note that by simulating the intervention as starting 5 days later than the actual issuance date, the fitting performance improves notably. We register R 2 = 0.9912 and RM SE = 2.1365 \u00d7 10 3 , with a decrease of 87.73% with respect to graph (a).",

Our search did not lead to satisfactory results, signaling the intervention time as the main source of discrepancy. To confirm the relevance of the intervention time, we performed further analyses via global sensitivity measures. Figure 3 shows that time to intervention (Interv.) is the key-driver in the variability of model predictions according to all the sensitivity measures used, i.e., variance-based total indices (T i ), first order indices (S i ) and the distribution-based sensitivity measure (\u03b2 Ku ) (see the supplementary quantitative appendix A for further details on the definition of these indices and the motivation for their simultaneous utilization.) It is followed by quarantine rate, number of initially infected individuals (I 0 ) and infection rate (\u03b2). On a relative scale time to intervention is (depending on the sensitivity measure) 4.70 to 6.18 times more important than the quarantine rate. In turn, the quarantine rate is 1.50 to 2.20 times more important than the initial number of affected individuals, which, in turn, is 1.30 to 1.60 times more important than the infection rate. Protection rate, infection rate and average latent time play an even minor role. Figure 4 displays the conditional regression plots estimated from a subsample of size 500,000. Interaction Quantification Figure 5 displays the magnitude of the interaction effects among the factors. The highest recorded interactions (the first six bars are individual effects) are among \u03b4, I 0 and the intervention time, namely the three most important factors. In terms of overall relevance, interaction effects account for less than 8% of the variance of the affected individuals. The mean dimension is 1.1683 (see Appendix A for the mathematical definitions). This means interactions have a low overall effect, although the effect is not entirely negligible. In fact, the highest interaction (between intervention time and \u03b4) is 17.86% of the highest individual effect. Aside this interaction, we register a non-negligible interaction between intervention time and initial number of infected individuals (I 0 ). Note that these three factors are also the ones identified as most influential by the global sensitivity measures.",

The investigation has evidenced a time-lag between the moment interventions have been issued and the moment in which their effect has actually taken place changing the pandemic path. Indeed this result seem to reflect a physical mechanism. While shelter-in-place measures are officially established on a given date, it is unlikely that they have an immediate effect. For instance, individuals might not be able to interrupt all contacts immediately, they do not have instantaneous access to masks or other protecting equipment. Moreover, some activities cannot shutdown immediately due to technical reasons, and certain industrial compartments have to remain open to keep delivering essential services to the population. ). The first six bars concern the individual factor effects, the next 15 represent the average magnitudes of the second order effects, the next 20 bars refer to third order effects, etc.. factors relate to social distancing measures.

Figure 6 displays the number of total, quarantined, recovered, deceased individuals as a function of time, as per the publicly available data from 24 February till 20 April. The vertical lines display the dates of 09 March 2020, at which the lockdown measures were officially deployed. Fitting the generalized SEIR model discussed above on the data from 24 February to 08 March (13 days) for Italy, we obtain the pre-lockdown parameter estimates. Then, fitting the same model on the data from 09 March to 20 April (42 days), we obtain the after-lockdown parameter estimates reported in Table 1 . Note that the after-parameters estimates are significantly different from the pre-lockdown estimates. For instance, the protection rate \u03b1 increases by over 2,000 times; The average latent time increases by over 6.5 times; the quarantine rate \u03b4 decreases by 37%. Uncertainty quantification To further understand the results, we have let the model undergo an uncertainty quantification in order to be able to compute global sensitivity measures. We used the parameter distribution assignments displayed in Table 2 (see also [9] ) and generated a random Monte Carlo sample of size N = 1, 000, 000. Table 2 : Uncertainty quantification: the after lockdown parametric values of \u03b1, \u03b2, (\u03b3) \u22121 and \u03b4 are assigned distributions as per the data of [9] .

Also, we have calculated importance indices that go under the name of global sensitivity measures to determine the quantitatively the relative importance of the inputs [See Supplementary Appendix A]. Specifically, we have used the first and total order global sensitivity measures based on variance contribution and a sensitivity measures based on the distance between cumulative distribution functions. The rationale of the choice is as follows. Regarding importance, the total order as well as the distribution-based sensitivity measure possess the properties that they are null if and only if the model output is probabilistically independent of the input of interest. Thus, their null value reassures us that the input is, indeed, not influential. Regarding interaction quantification, the difference between the first and the total order indices provides information about the relevance of interactions, giving insights on whether a factor's influence is due to its individual action or due to interactions with other factors. This insight, however, is an overall insight and does not reveal which interactions (if any) are important. Towards this understanding we use a sample of size 20,000, replicating a full factorial design and decomposing the output changes via a finite difference operation (see Appendix A fpor further details). The scheme allows us to compute a total of 20,000 first order effects for each input, 20,000 second order interaction indices for all pairs, and 20,000 interaction indices of order 3, 4, and 5 and 6, enabling interactions to be thoroughly studied.",

We just recall the key intuition here. Let X i a subset of the reals that represents the support of model input x i . Then, consider a partition of X i into M bins, such that \u222a M m=1 X m i = X i and X m i \u2229 X r i = \u2205 for r, m = 1, 2, ..., M , r = m. The intuition of a given-data estimation is then that of substituting the condition X i = x i (that is X i is exactly at x i ) with the bin condition X i \u2208 X m i . Intuitively, this condition asks that X i is in a suitably defined interval around x i . With this intuition, one obtaines the estimate",

Then, one links the partition size (M) to the sample size (N ), so that as N increases the parition size tends to zero and the limiting partition is X i itself. [27] prove that, under mild assumptions, (the continuity of the operator d(\u00b7, \u00b7) in both its arguments and the Riemann-Stieltjes integrability of d(F Y , F Y |Xi )), \u03be i converges to \u03be i as the sample size increases; that is, \u03be i is an asymptotically consistent estimator of \u03be i . These calculations are implemented in the subroutine betaKS3.m. Finally, the conditional regression functions r i (x i ) = E[Y |X i = x i ] have been estimated using the subroutine cosi.m. Both subroutines are developed by Elmar Plischke and available at https://zenodo.org/record/885332#.XpnB44gzZGM (see [30] and [31] for details).",

The empirical density is skewed, with a mean of 1.7769 \u00d7 10 5 individuals, standard deviation of 9.0035 \u00d7 10 4 , 95 upper quantile on 3.5032 \u00d7 10 5 . Thus, the model foresees an expected number of infected individuals between 0.6216 \u00d7 10 5 and 3.9163 \u00d7 10 5 , which is consistent with actual data (red vertical line). The empirical density is computed on a sample of 1,000,000 realizations of the forecasts of total infected individuals. Uncertainty in the model predictions is the result of uncertainty in six factors acting as parameters of the generalized SEIR model: protection rate (\u03b1), infection rate (\u03b2), average latent time (\u03b3 \u22121 ), average quarantine rate (\u03b4), the number of initial infected people (I 0 ) and the intervention time (Interv.). The distributions are discussed in Section 4. From these distributions uncertainty is propagated in the model through Monte Carlo simulation.Factor Importance From the previous Monte Carlo sample, we have calculated global sensitivity measures that determine quantitatively the relative importance of the inputs [See Supplementary Appendix A].Figure 3shows the results.",

For instance, the expected total number of infected individuals is linearly and monotonically decreasing in the protection rate (\u03b1). Similarly, we expect a decrease associated with an increase in latent time and quarantine rate, but an increase associated with infection rate (\u03b2), in the number of initially infected individuals (I 0 ) and with the time of intervention (Interv.). These qualitative results are in accordance with intuition. The only difference is that the conditional regression function shows a (still decreasing) non-linear behaviour for the total number of infected individuals as a function of the quarantine rate. The last graph can be used to obtain a quantitative indication: when the intervention time is delayed by 7 days, the median total number of infected people would be expected to increase by around 300%.
