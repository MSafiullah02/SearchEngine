The influenza A viruses are divided into subtypes and influenza B viruses into lineages based on their antigenic structure. The influenza A subtypes are differentiated based on characteristics of the haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) surface antigens.

The emergence of a pandemic influenza strain is unpredictable and can occur through two mechanisms. Firstly, a host could be simultaneously infected with two different influenza virus subtypes which could allow for exchange of genetic material or reassortment and the emergence of a new subtype. For example this could occur if a pig were infected by both a human and avian origin influenza subtype simultaneously with genetic exchange leading to the emergence of a virus adapted to spread in humans, but with HA and/or NA not currently circulating in humans. The second way that novel subtypes can emerge is if avian or other animal adapted subtypes are directly transmitted to humans and then undergo adaptation to allow transmission between humans. Currently some avian influenza virus subtypes such as influenza A(H5N2) can be transmitted to humans, usually following close contact with poultry, and cause severe infections.
