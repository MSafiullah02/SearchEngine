The sensitivity of the basic reproduction number R\n0 with respect to the parameters of the system model is given in Section 4. The usefulness of our model is then illustrated in Section 5 of numerical simulations, where we use real data from Wuhan. We end with Section 6 of conclusions, discussion, and future research.",

Moreover, we consider a fatality compartment, related to death due to the virus infection. In doing so, the constant total population size N is subdivided into eight epidemiological classes: susceptible class (S), exposed class (E), symptomatic and infectious class (I), super-spreaders class (P), infectious but asymptomatic class (A), hospitalized (H), recovery class (R), and fatality class (F). The model takes the following form:(1){dSdt=\u2212\u03b2INS\u2212l\u03b2HNS\u2212\u03b2\u2032PNS,dEdt=\u03b2INS+l\u03b2HNS+\u03b2\u2032PNS\u2212\u03baE,dIdt=\u03ba\u03c11E\u2212(\u03b3a+\u03b3i)I\u2212\u03b4iI,dPdt=\u03ba\u03c12E\u2212(\u03b3a+\u03b3i)P\u2212\u03b4pP,dAdt=\u03ba(1\u2212\u03c11\u2212\u03c12)E,dHdt=\u03b3a(I+P)\u2212\u03b3rH\u2212\u03b4hH,dRdt=\u03b3i(I+P)+\u03b3rH,dFdt=\u03b4iI(t)+\u03b4pP(t)+\u03b4hH(t), with \u03b2 quantifying the human-to-human transmission coefficient per unit time (days) per person, \u03b2\u2032 quantifies a high transmission coefficient due to super-spreaders, and l quantifies the relative transmissibility of hospitalized patients. Here \u03ba is the rate at which an individual leaves the exposed class by becoming infectious (symptomatic, super-spreaders or asymptomatic); \u03c1\n1 is the proportion of progression from exposed class E to symptomatic infectious class I; \u03c1\n2 is a relative very low rate at which exposed individuals become super-spreaders while 1\u2212\u03c11\u2212\u03c12 is the progression from exposed to asymptomatic class; \u03b3a is the average rate at which symptomatic and super-spreaders individuals become hospitalized; \u03b3i is the recovery rate without being hospitalized; \u03b3r is the recovery rate of hospitalized patients; and \u03b4i, \u03b4p, and \u03b4h are the disease induced death rates due to infected, super-spreaders, and hospitalized individuals, respectively. At each instant of time,(2)D(t):=\u03b4iI(t)+\u03b4pP(t)+\u03b4hH(t)=dF(t)dt gives the number of death due to the disease. The transmissibility from asymptomatic individuals has been modeled in this way since it was not apparent their behavior. Indeed, at present, this question is a controversial issue for epidemiologists. A flowchart of model (1) is presented in Figure 1\n.",

The sensitivity analysis for the endemic threshold (4) tells us how important each parameter is to disease transmission. This information is crucial not only for experimental design, but also to data assimilation and reduction of complex models [16]. Sensitivity analysis is commonly used to determine the robustness of model predictions to parameter values, since there are usually errors in collected data and presumed parameter values. It is used to discover parameters that have a high impact on the threshold R\n0 and should be targeted by intervention strategies. More accurately, sensitivity indices\u2019 allows us to measure the relative change in a variable when a parameter changes. For that purpose, we use the normalized forward sensitivity index of a variable with respect to a given parameter, which is defined as the ratio of the relative change in the variable to the relative change in the parameter. If such variable is differentiable with respect to the parameter, then the sensitivity index is defined as follows.Definition 1.1See [17], [18]The normalized forward sensitivity index of R\n0, which is differentiable with respect to a given parameter \u03b8, is defined by\u03a5\u03b8R0=\u2202R0\u2202\u03b8\u03b8R0.\n\n",

In the future, we can develop further this prototype. Even with these shortcomings, the model can be useful due to the high relevance of the topic. Finally, we suggest new directions for further research:1.the transmissibility from asymptomatic individuals;2.compare, in the near future, our results with other models;3.consider sub-populations related to age, gender, etc.;4.introduce preventive measures in this COVID-19 epidemic and for future viruses;5.integrate into the model some imprecise data by using fuzzy differential equations;6.include the viral load of the infectious into the model.\n",
