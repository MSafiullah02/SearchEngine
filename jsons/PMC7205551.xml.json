However, we are encountering several challenges. First, we noticed an initial decrease in older adults\u2019 use of mental health services since lockdown was officially announced by authorities on March 15 (Lebanon-News, 2020). This phenomenon gradually improved with the patients adapting progressively to telepsychiatry services. From a therapeutic perspective, there has been a recent shift in the treatment modalities opted by older patients: due to contamination fear, most older patients and their caregivers have been avoiding inpatient treatment, even when needed. Also, electroconvulsive therapy, which is often indicated in this population for treatment-resistant or psychotic depression, was discontinued by most.",

            "text": "Considering the new realities imposed by this pandemic, several solutions are already being implemented and more are being considered. First, the practice of telepsychiatry has become very popular and is imposing itself as an effective and practical alternative to face-to-face psychiatric interviews even beyond the pandemic, given the scarcity of geriatric psychiatrists in Lebanon, and challenges related to transportation of frail, bedridden or institutionalized older adults. Although most older patients are showing initial resistance to change, they are progressively becoming accustomed to it, especially with the assistance of a caregiver. In the past few years, older Lebanese have increasingly become active users of social media and communication applications (especially WhatsApp). For the aim of staying connected with their loved ones within this pandemic, this phenomenon has further increased. For the convenience of older adults, most psychiatrists have been using the same applications they are familiar with to conduct psychiatric interviews rather than imposing on them novel technologies. However, telepsychiatry practice is not without any limitations, especially in specific populations such as the eldest old (aged 85 years and more) with a low level of education and those who live in remote areas with poor internet service. In these instances, regular phone consultations (on a fixed line) are being performed. Either way, psychiatrists have been recommending to their patients to keep socially connected using any available mean of communication to minimize the impact of social isolation shown to be the most significant predictor of developing mental disorders in Lebanese seniors (Karam, 2016). Additionally, we have been relying on the primary caregivers (family member or nurse at the nursing home) to describe abnormal movements, or to bring the camera closer to check for a patient\u2019s tremor for instance, to assure a \u201cvirtual\u201d physical exam.",

Additionally, a hotline handled by a geriatric nurse at the AAL is provided to caregivers of patients with dementia to answer their urgent questions during this difficult period. Also, the Institute for Development, Research, Advocacy and Applied Care (IDRAAC) has been holding weekly public webinars about mental disorders potentially exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The attendance of these webinars and support groups has been increased by the fact that people are confined at home, raising awareness about mental illness on a large scale, which will most likely translate into better care of themselves and the older individuals they are taking care of. This unexpected positive outcome is encouraging these organizations to keep conducting online support groups and webinars on a regular basis, beyond the pandemic.",

            "text": "An important challenge to address in the future is setting the infrastructure for establishing advance directives among older Lebanese, in order to better preserve their autonomy should their decision-making capacity becomes altered by an acute serious illness. This pandemic shed light on the imminent need of the elderly to establish a living will as well as designate a legally authorized representative for medical-related decisions at an early age (<50 years old). Additionally, the British Medical Association discussed in its latest guidelines the issue of prioritizing mechanical ventilation for younger healthier patients over older patients with COVID-19 complications (British Medical Association, 2020), which application is raising ethical concerns around the globe, especially in LMIC countries where the number of ventilators can be limited. Although such a dilemma has not occurred yet in Lebanon, these recommendations incite our government and policy makers to revisit the construct of our ethical, social, and medico-legal systems. An ethical committee needs to be established to anticipate and address any future challenges related to sick older adults on a national level. Other future avenues involve developing and piloting technological applications that are elderly-friendly to fulfill their mental and social needs, as well as offer reliable information and tips in times of crisis. Mediterranean countries have recently shown a trend toward supporting innovative models of socio-ethical care, designed to benefit dependent older adults who lack standard social/family support: the European Union under the European Neighborhood Instrument, Cross-Border Cooperation, Mediterranean Sea Basin Program (ENI-CBC-MED) is currently funding a new project entitled \u201cDevelopment of a Transcultural social-ethical-care model for dependent population in Mediterra basin\u201d (TEC-MED) (ENIC-CBC-MED, 2020). The aim of this project is to develop an innovative yet cost-effective socio-ethical care intervention framework which will adapt and improve social care policies in the aging population. A new organizational model involving public institutions and social care actors will be designed and validated in different Mediterranean countries, including Lebanon (under the direct supervision of author GK); the goal being to protect older adults from social isolation.",
