            "text": "Viral gastroenteritis represents a significant economic and public health burden, causing high morbidity and mortality rates, mainly in the poorest countries (Das et al., 2014). Human rotaviruses (HRoV) are a major cause of severe diarrheal disease in infants and young children are the second most common cause of death in children less than 5 years old (Marcotte and Hammarstr\u00f6m, 2016). Because no specific antiviral drug is available, conventional treatment for HRoV acute gastroenteritis is largely symptomatic and involves fluid and electrolyte replacement and maintenance of nutrition. Despite the introduction of oral HRoV vaccines that have significantly reduced the incidence of the disease in developed countries (Payne et al., 2013), the impact of this active prophylaxis on global estimates of HRoV mortality has been limited (Tate et al., 2016). This is mainly due to inadequate immunization coverage in lower income countries, where the burden of diarrheal disease is higher and vaccines are mostly needed. In fact, oral vaccines are less immunogenic when given to infants in low-income countries compared with high-income countries for a number of reasons, including transplacental maternally acquired antibodies, breastfeeding, histo blood group antigens, malnutrition, microbiota dysbiosis, and environmental enteropathy. Moreover, the scarce availability of vaccines in these areas, along with their contraindications in immunodeficient patients (Babji and Kang, 2012; Binder et al., 2014; Gaspar et al., 2014; Glass et al., 2014), leave between one-third and one-half of children unprotected from severe HRoV disease (Babji and Kang, 2012). These hindrances, together with the suboptimal use of therapeutic oral rehydration solutions, justify the development of effective alternative prophylactic and therapeutic approaches to prevent and control HRoV gastroenteritis disease, especially for immunocompromised hosts.",

In particular, bovine colostrum (BC) has evolved into a highly effective host defense mechanism (Rainard and Riollet, 2006). In ruminants, no transplacental exchange of immune factors occurs in utero; therefore, colostrum and, to a lesser extent, mature milk provide protection through a high immunoglobulin content, without which the newborn would not survive (Larson et al., 1980). The immunoglobulins present in BC are IgG1, IgG2, IgA, and IgM (Ogra and Ogra, 1978). The abundance of different immunoglobulin classes in colostrum and milk varies among species, with IgA being predominant in human mammary secretions. In contrast, in BC, IgG1 is the most represented (Barrington et al., 1997), whereas IgA and IgM are present at much lower concentrations. The BC immunoglobulins, in conjunction with the ability of the ruminant neonatal gut to allow unrestricted passage of the large immunoglobulin molecules, provide the young animal with passive immunization (Bush and Staley, 1980; Moore et al., 2005).",

To date, HBC containing HRoV-specific, neutralizing IgG has been produced by immunizing pregnant cows with HRoV and harvesting colostrum after delivery. However, the additional costs and regulatory and safety issues arising from the use of an HRoV vaccine make it impossible to generate HBC on a large scale. The alternative use of BC from nonimmunized cows (NHBC) may bypass these limits but, as expected, the literature has shown that NHBC has significantly lower anti-HRoV efficacy (Inagaki et al., 2010). In this study, we present proof-of-concept data showing a protective effect of HBC from cows vaccinated with a conventional bovine rotavirus strain (BRoV) against different HRoV genotypes.",

The results summarized in Table 2\nshow that neither NHBC nor HBC had antiviral activity against human pathogens, including HSV-1, HCMV, or HRhV. Although HBC showed a weak antiviral activity against HSV-2, nevertheless it was not able to inhibit viral infectivity to 100%. As expected, NHBC was effective against bovine pathogens such as BRoV NCDV (EC50 = 61.5 \u00b5g of protein/mL) and VSV (EC50 = 64 \u00b5g of protein/mL; Table 2). Of note, NHBC had non-strain-restricted antiviral efficacy against the HRoV strains Wa (EC50 = 2.3 \u00b5g of protein/mL), HRV248 (EC50 = 4.2 \u00b5g of protein/mL), and HRV408 (EC50 = 12.6 \u00b5g of protein/mL) with percentages of inhibition up to 100% (Figure 4\n). To test the hypothesis that colostrum from cows immunized with a veterinary anti-BRoV vaccine may exert a higher anti-HRoV activity than that from nonimmunized cows, we performed a second set of antiviral assays. As expected, HBC exerted significantly (P < 0.0001; F test) higher antiviral activity against BRoV NCDV (EC50 = 5.5 \u00b5g of protein/mL), compared with colostrum of nonimmunized cows (Table 2). This result indicates that vaccination elicited an anti-BRoV immune response. Notably, HBC was also significantly (0.0001 < P < 0.0005; F test) more effective than NHBC against Wa (EC50 = 0.3 \u00b5g of protein/mL), HRV248 (EC50 = 1.6 \u00b5g of protein/mL), and HRV408 (EC50 = 2.1 \u00b5g of protein/mL; Table 2), suggesting a high titer of cross-reactive IgG in HBC. Therefore, we performed a third set of experiments to test the presence of anti-HRoV IgG in HBC-derived IgG. The results shown in Table 3\nand Figure 5\ndemonstrate that these IgG inhibit the infectivity of BRoV strain NCDV (EC50 = 6.2 \u00b5g of protein/mL) but, more interestingly, also have strong antiviral activity against HRoV strains Wa (EC50 = 1.9 \u00b5g of protein/mL), HRV248 (EC50 = 0.7 \u00b5g of protein/mL), and HRV408 (EC50 = 1.8 \u00b5g of protein/mL) with percentages of inhibition up to 100%. As a negative control for IgG antiviral assays, we treated cells with equal volumes of IgG-depleted AS supernatant; results shown in Table 3 and Figure 5 show that the IgG-depleted AS supernatant did not have significant antiviral activity. Notably, treatment of the different cell lines with NHBC, HBC, and IgG did not affect cell viability, even at high concentrations, showing that the antiviral activity we observed was not caused by nonspecific cytotoxic effects.",

            "text": "Boosting the natural concentrations of immune components in colostrum and milk by vaccinating cows offers great potential for their use as prophylactic or therapeutic products in humans. Hyperimmune BC from cows vaccinated with HRoV was an effective therapeutic approach to reduce the duration and severity of RoV-caused diarrhea in a double-blind controlled clinical study with infants of 6 to 24 mo of age (Mitra et al., 1995). In a second study, Davidson et al. (1989) produced HBC by introducing a vaccine containing 4 HRoV into pregnant Friesian cows. They demonstrated that this HBC administered orally mediated protection by preventing HRoV infection. Efficacy of passive immunization with HBC-derived IgG is documented in the literature. Hilpert et al. (1987) treated infants hospitalized with acute diarrhea with anti-rotavirus immunoglobulin concentrate without observing a significant decrease in duration of diarrhea or excretion of virus. Turner and Kelsey (1993) demonstrated a reduction in incidence and duration of diarrhea in treated infants. Sarker et al. (1998) produced HBC by immunizing pregnant cows with HRoV strains Wa, RV3, RV5, and ST3 (representing serotypes 1 to 4, respectively). The HBC-purified IgG were then administered in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial to children with diagnosed HRoV diarrhea. Children who received HBC-IgG had significantly less daily and total stool output and frequency and required less oral rehydration solution than did children who received placebo. However, it is difficult to generate large-scale amounts of HBC by immunizing cows with an unconventional HRoV vaccine; indeed, the yield is insufficient to cover the global requirement because over 500,000 deaths occur worldwide every year due to rotavirus-induced diarrhea (Bagwe et al., 2015). To overcome these limitations, we proposed and tested the hypothesis that HBC from cows immunized with a conventional veterinary vaccine against BRoV would exert a higher anti-HRoV activity than NHBC due to a high titer of cross-reactive anti-HRoV IgG. Indeed, our results confirm this hypothesis and indicate an easier and cheaper approach for the production of anti-HRoV HBC or IgG in cows. We demonstrated an in vitro HRoV inhibition efficacy (i.e., EC50) of HBC comparable to that of Inagaki and colleagues, who treated MA104 cells with skimmed and concentrated bovine late colostrum from HRoV-immunized cows (Inagaki et al., 2010, 2013). We demonstrated that HBC and its IgG can inhibit the infectivity of 4 RoV with 4 different GP genotypes (Table 1), suggesting that vaccination with BRoV stimulates the production of cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies.",
