Procedure Medical records of cats diagnosed with endogenous uveitis at North Carolina State University's College of Veterinary Medicine (NCSU-CVM) or Animal Eye Care Associates of Cary, NC between 2003 and 2015 were reviewed. Inclusion criteria were cats that had complete diagnostic workups, including clinical, clinicopathological, serological, and histopathological data, as well as imaging modalities. Serology was consistently completed for feline leukemia virus (FeLV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), feline coronavirus (FCoV), Toxoplasma gondii, and Bartonella spp. Results One hundred and twenty cats met the inclusion criteria. Seroprevalence of FeLV (2.7%), FIV (7.3%), FCoV (34.7%), T. gondii (23.7%), and Bartonella spp. (43.2%) was observed, with a combined seroprevalence of 59.2%. Nineteen cats (15.8%) were diagnosed with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) based on clinical, hematological, serological, histopathological, and necropsy findings. The average age of all cases was 7.62 years, while the average age of cats diagnosed with FIP was 1.82 years. Neoplasia was diagnosed in six cats (5.0%).

This may be due to improved diagnostic capabilities or that cats with infectious disease were more likely to be referred. Because of the high prevalence of FIP, young cats with uveitis should be evaluated for hyperglobulinemia and FCoV serology should be performed as minimal diagnostics.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Feline uveitis, which is a common ocular condition, is usually divided into exogenous and endogenous causes. 1 Exogenous causes are commonly identified by a thorough ocular examination and include trauma, corneal ulcers, and lens luxations. Endogenous causes, which are the most common cause of uveitis in cats, tend to be divided into large categories, including infectious, neoplastic, and immune-mediated or idiopathic. 2 The most commonly reported infectious agents associated with feline endogenous uveitis are feline leukemia virus (FeLV), 3, 4 feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), 5, 6 feline coronavirus (FCoV) causing feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), 4, 7 bartonellosis, 8, 9 toxoplasmosis, 10, 11 and systemic fungal infections, including cryptococcosis, 12, 13 histoplasmosis, 14 blastomycosis, 15 and coccidioidomycosis. 16, 17 The most common primary neoplastic cause of uveitis is iris melanoma, followed by trauma associated sarcoma, while the most common metastatic neoplasia is lymphoma. 2, 18 Determining the specific etiologic agent causing uveitis can be difficult due to a similar clinical presentation of most endogenous causes. While neoplasia may be diagnosed based on appearance and confirmed with cytology of aqueous humor or biopsies, aqueous humor cytology is generally not as beneficial in definitively diagnosing infectious agents. 19 Therefore, a thorough physical examination, complete blood cell count, serum biochemistry profile, urinalysis, thoracic radiographs, abdominal ultrasound, and select serological titers are recommended in many cases of endogenous uveitis to narrow down the differential list. 20 In addition, despite their inability to definitively diagnose the cause of endogenous uveitis, aqueous humor serology and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are still methods used to investigate possible causes, including Bartonella spp, T. gondii, FCoV, and feline herpesvirus-1 (FHV-1). Aqueous humor serology and PCR results, as well as serum serology, must be interpreted carefully, as serology usually indicates exposure, not active infection, and the high sensitivity of PCR can make it difficult to determine whether an infection is active. 21 Retrospective studies investigating the causes of feline uveitis were completed in the early 1990s, and diagnoses relied heavily on results of serologic tests [22] [23] [24] or histopathology. 4 These studies found that between 16-20% 23, 24 and 70% 22 of cases had no evidence of a systemic cause or infection. A more recent study investigating the diagnostic quality of aqueous humor serology, found similar results, in that 40% of cats with uveitis had serum that was serologically negative for FeLV, FIV, Toxoplasma, and Bartonella spp. 21 One study published in 1991, that focused specifically on cats presenting to ophthalmologists in North Carolina, found infectious agents caused 15% of uveitis cases, neoplasia caused 13%, and systemic hypertension caused 2%. The remaining 70% of cases were deemed idiopathic. 22 With the advance of new diagnostic tests and a greater awareness of possible etiologic agents, the purpose of this study was to investigate the causes of feline endogenous uveitis in North Carolina by reviewing the medical records of cats diagnosed with endogenous uveitis at referral ophthalmology clinics in North Carolina.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 109, "end": 110, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 423, "end": 424, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 546, "end": 548, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 549, "end": 550, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 588, "end": 590, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 591, "end": 592, "text": "6", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 664, "end": 666, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 667, "end": 668, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 684, "end": 686, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 687, "end": 688, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 704, "end": 707, "text": "10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 708, "end": 710, "text": "11", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 769, "end": 772, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 773, "end": 775, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 792, "end": 794, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 810, "end": 812, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 837, "end": 840, "text": "16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 841, "end": 843, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1009, "end": 1011, "text": "2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1012, "end": 1014, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1366, "end": 1368, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1644, "end": 1646, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2192, "end": 2194, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2354, "end": 2358, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2359, "end": 2363, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2364, "end": 2368, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2388, "end": 2389, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 2430, "end": 2433, "text": "23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2434, "end": 2436, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2736, "end": 2738, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 3015, "end": 3017, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Medical records of cats that were presented to the Ophthalmology Service at the NCSU-CVM or Animal Eye Care Associates of Cary, North Carolina, between 2003 and 2015 were reviewed.

While many cases did have a definitive diagnosis, toxoplasmosis and bartonellosis cannot be diagnosed as causes of uveitis based solely on the presence of seropositivity. 10, 11, 21, 29, 30 In addition, there are no pathognomonic ocular lesions for bartonellosis or toxoplasmosis. Toxoplasmosis can only be definitively diagnosed with histopathology. 31 However, while organisms are commonly found in the eyes in patients with disseminated toxoplasmosis, it is rare to find the organism in the eyes of cats whose only manifestation of T. gondii is ocular disease. 4, 29 In addition, while studies have found that PCR 32,33 and serology 10 for T. gondii reveal positive results when performed on the aqueous humor of cats with uveitis, these same studies also found positive results in the eyes of clinically normal cats. This makes diagnosing T. gondii as the cause of uveitis in patients with only ocular disease very difficult. While serology cannot definitively diagnose an active toxoplasmosis infection due to the fact that IgG titers can remain elevated for two years or longer following infection, 34 a fourfold rise in IgG titers over two to five weeks, or an IgM titer greater than 1:64 has been associated with active toxoplasmosis infections. 35 If these factors were used to evaluate the T. gondii titers of the cats in this study, it would indicate that there were no cases of uveitis caused by active T. gondii infections, although only three animals had paired titers (see Table 2 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 276, "end": 279, "text": "10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 280, "end": 283, "text": "11,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 284, "end": 287, "text": "21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 288, "end": 291, "text": "29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 292, "end": 294, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 456, "end": 458, "text": "31", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 669, "end": 671, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 672, "end": 674, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1359, "end": 1361, "text": "35", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1593, "end": 1600, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In a population setting, however, serological testing can still be beneficial to investigate the prevalence of T. gondii. Worldwide, the estimated seroprevalence of T. gondii is 30-40%, 36, 37 but this varies with location, as it has been reported as high as 97% in Egypt. 38 Seroprevalence within the United States ranges from 8 to 80%. 39 The seropositivity specifically in cats with uveitis has been documented to be between 74 and 78%, which is considerably higher than the seroprevalence in healthy cats in those same areas at 42.9% and 49.4%. 10, 23 The total seroprevalence of T. gondii in patients included in this study was lower at only 23.7%. This is consistent with more recent studies, in which 18.3% of cats with uveitis were seropositive in a nation-wide study performed in 2010, 21 and 34% of healthy cats were found to be seropositive in a nearby geographic area of this present study in Randolph County, North Carolina. 40 Similar to T. gondii, it can be difficult to diagnose bartonellosis as the causative agent of uveitis. The gold standard for diagnosing bartonellosis is isolation of the bacteria, but even this is nonconfirmatory as healthy cats in endemic areas can be bacteremic. 41 Like T. gondii, using aqueous humor for PCR or serology can help strengthen a presumed diagnosis of bartonellosis, but cannot be used for definitive diagnosis. 9, 21 Serology must be interpreted very carefully, as previous studies have documented a higher seroprevalence for Bartonella spp. in healthy cats, than those with uveitis. 21, 30 Although this could be due to the high flea prevalence of the healthy cats included in these studies, a recent study from 2010 also found that there was no association between feline patients with uveitis and seropositivity for Bartonella spp. 42 Therefore, like T. gondii, serology for Bartonella spp. can be helpful to rule out bartonellosis, as its negative predictive value is 89-97%; however, it is not very helpful in diagnosing the cause of uveitis in individual cases. 43 On a population level, Bartonella spp. seroprevalence can still reveal valuable information. Like T. gondii, seroprevalence for Bartonella spp. varies with geography, and additionally, it is associated with flea populations. 44 In general, seroprevalence can range from 10 to 80% in apparently healthy cats, 43 and a study completed in Randolph County, North Carolina, found 75% of healthy cats were seropositive for B. henselae. 40 This present study, which was completed in a similar geographic area to that study, found Bartonella spp. seroprevalence for cats diagnosed with uveitis was only 43.2%.
