These defects are not unique to HIV infection, and a number of viral infections have been associated with impaired neutrophil function [35] . A wide range of functional defects exist, including defects in chemotaxis, phagocytosis, the respiratory (oxidative) burst, and microbicidal capacity [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] . Neutrophils isolated from HIV-infected patients have a profound defect in chemotaxis in response to interleukin (IL)-8 and bacterial chemoattractant peptides, such as f-met-leu-phe (fMLP), and the degree of impairment correlates with the degree of CD4 + T-cell depletion. Other physiologic functions related to recruitment to sites of infection, rolling, adhesion, and emigration are also affected, as shown in a feline leukemia virus (FIV) infection model. Evidence that this may be due to a maturation defect is decreased granularity of neutrophils from the blood and bone marrow of FIVinfected animals. The results of different studies of neutrophil function in HIV infection are at times conflicting and can be explained by different assays, different conditions, and differences in the patient populations studied. The most important clinical variable is the stage of HIV disease as evidenced by absolute CD4 + T-cell count.",

A number of investigators have shown that neutrophils are activated in vivo throughout the course of HIV infection, even in the absence of any clinical signs of secondary infectious complications [46] . Early in the course of HIV infection in vivo, activation or priming may actually result in enhanced function. This in vivo activation continues throughout the course of HIV infection, but eventually the functional capacity of the neutrophil begins to decrease significantly.

            "text": "Our studies of neutrophil chemiluminescence suggest that immune system activation may contribute to neutrophil dysfunction [42] . Maximum opsonin receptor expression (MOR) is achieved by exposing neutrophil to quantities of proinflammatory mediators (primers: fMLP, complement fragment C5a, and platelet-activating factor) to induce a maximal number of CD11b (C3bi receptor) and CD35 (C3b receptor or complement receptor 1) on the neutrophil surface. Priming may also enhance oxidative responses to a second stimulus by increasing the affinity of opsonin receptors for their particular ligand or enhancing intracellular signaling. Our experiments showed increases in the ratio of the chemiluminescence unprimed neutrophil at circulating opsonin receptor expression (COR) to chemiluminescence with MOR, i.e., an increased COR/MOR ratio. By whatever mechanism, neutrophils from HIV-infected patients behave as if they have been primed or activated by proinflammatory mediators in vivo. Opsonin receptor-independent NADPH-oxidase and myeloperoxidase activities, basal and stimulated, were significantly increased for HIV-infected patients, especially those with advanced disease with CD4 + lymphocyte count <200 cells/mm 3 . The increase in enzyme activities of NADPH-oxidase and myeloperoxidase may also be the result of in vivo activation. The decrease in myeloperoxidase activity for patients with very advanced HIV infection with CD4 + lymphocyte count <100 cells/mm 3 , although significantly higher than values seen in control subjects without HIV infection, may be due to degranulation resulting from in vivo activation. This chronic in vivo activation may lead to metabolic exhaustion or \"burnout,\" and contributes to impaired neutrophil oxidative responses in HIV-infected patients at advanced stages of disease.",

Neutrophils isolated from patients with advanced HIV disease undergo accelerated apoptosis or programmed cell death. We studied apoptosis of neutrophils isolated from ten individuals with advanced HIV infection and seven control subjects [48] . Ex vivo apoptosis was examined morphologically by fluorescent microscopy after dual staining with acridine orange and ethidium bromide, fluorescent stains that intercalate DNA. Acridine orange stains the nucleus bright green and allows visualization of the nuclear chromatin pattern, while ethidium bromide identifies nonviable cells by staining the nucleus orange. Little apoptosis was evident immediately after isolation, but over time, apoptosis was observed and the proportion of apoptotic cells was significantly higher for the patients with advanced HIV infection at 3, 6, and 18 h (Fig. 1 ). Apoptotic cells eventually die, and at 18 h there was a significant decrease in viability for the HIV patient's neutrophils due to an increased number of nonviable, apoptotic cells. As neutrophils become apoptotic, they become functionally impaired, and the accelerated apoptosis of neutrophils may in part explain the impairment of neutrophil function seen in this patient population, as well as neutropenia. A number of possible mechanisms for accelerated apoptosis exist, including increased levels of proinflammatory mediators that may accelerate the process. Other mechanisms may also be involved, including direct effects of viral proteins. HIV protease can directly induce apoptosis of a variety of leukocyte populations [49] . Alternatively, growth factor deficiency could result in accelerated apoptosis.",

Both HIV and cytomegalovirus (CMV) can infect bone marrow stromal cells and impair production of endogenous colony-stimulating factors such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) [51, 52] . Altered cytokine secretion may result in abnormal neutrophil maturation. G-CSF is a key growth factor important in maintaining the normal number of circulating neutrophils. Although several growth factors can stimulate myelopoiesis, studies of G-CSF-deficient knock-out mice indicate G-CSF is a cytokine necessary to maintain normal neutrophil counts [53] . Evidence is accumulating that HIV infection results in a state of endogenous G-CSF deficiency [54, 55] . Patients with HIV have lower serum levels of endogenous G-CSF for a given degree of neutropenia compared with patients with neutropenia from other etiologies, such as aplastic anemia and cancer chemotherapy. The low levels of G-CSF may not only impair myelopoiesis and The principle way growth factors cause clonal expansion of different bone marrow precursors is by inhibiting apoptosis of these cells [56] .

T17 cells develop as a result of a unique set of cytokines secreted by effector cells of the innate immune system (e.g., neutrophils) and additive effects of IL-1b and tumor-necrosis factor (TNF)-a. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-b and IL-6 are crucial factors in the generation of Th17 cells from naive T-cells. The functional capacity of Th17 cells depends on the additional cytokines IL-23 and IL-1.",

The activity of IL-17A and IL-17F is defined by induction of increased production of a number of proinflammatory mediators, including IL-1, IL-6, CXC chemokines, TNF-a, G-CSF, and GM-CSF by epithelial and endothelial cells, macrophages, and other stromal cells. IL-17A also promotes stem-cell factor (SCF)-and G-CSF-mediated granulopoiesis [60] . It has been controversial as to whether or not neutrophils directly respond to IL-17A or IL-17F, but the downstream production of cytokines induced by IL-17A and IL-17F leads to granulopoiesis, neutrophil recruitment, and neutrophil activation. Substantial evidence exists of cross-talk between neutrophils and Th17 CD4 + T-cells [61] . Purified human neutrophils produce chemokines that attract Th1 and Th17 cells, while Th17 cells produce CXCL8, a potent chemoattractant for neutrophils.",

Depletion of Th17 cells in the gut has been associated with decreased microbial barrier function of the gut and persistent immune activation due to gut translocation [66] .

At that time, it was unknown how rHuG-CSF affected T-cell function or production of a lymphocyte growth factor. In retrospect, neutrophil activation may lead to IL-6 release, subsequent Th17 differentiation, and IL-17 production. An inverse relationship exists between Treg and Th17 cells, so an increase in Th17-inducing cytokines may lead to a decrease in Tregs that mediate immunosuppression. Furthermore, T-cells are not only the source but also the target of IL-17. IL-17 can modulate Th1 cell polarization both in vitro and in vivo by directly acting on CD4 + T-cells [69] . Overall, however, the effects of rHuG-CSF on CD4 + lymphocyte counts have been variable [70, 71] .",

Farber et al., in one of the first studies to examine the risk of infection, retrospectively examined the records of 30 HIV-infected patients with ANC <1.0 \u00c2 10 9 /L and CD4 + lymphocyte count <200 cells/mm 3 , comparing infection rates during neutropenic periods and non-neutropenic periods and comparing infection rates in these patients with 37 patients with hematologic malignancies as controls. In that study, no difference was found between infection rates in HIV patients during neutropenic periods compared with non-neutropenic periods [72] . Piliero et al., in reviewing blood culture data from 38 HIV-infected patients with ANC <0.5 \u00c2 10 9 /L and 1,071 non-neutropenic HIV patients, found that the presence of a central venous catheter, but not neutropenia, was a risk factor for positive blood cultures in a multiple logistic regression model [73] .",

Shaunik and Bartlett, in an era when zidovudine monotherapy dosed at 1,200 mg/day was the standard of care for HIV treatment (compared with the dose of 600 mg/day used in current HAART regimens), found in a study of 30 patients that an ANC <0.5 \u00c2 10 9 /L was associated with an incidence of bacterial infection that was 600% higher than the incidence observed when ANC was >1.0 \u00c2 10 9 /L [74] . Keizer et al. performed a case-control study comparing 29 HIV-infected patients followed from 1991 to 1993 with two consecutive measured ANC <1.0 \u00c2 10 9 /L with 29 HIV-infected controls without history of neutropenia matched for age, sex, CD4 + lymphocyte count, and month of entry into the clinic. An incidence of 12.6 episodes of bacteremia per 100 patient-months was observed in the patients with a history of neutropenia compared with an incidence of 0.87 episodes of bacteremia per 100 patient-months observed in the controls, a statistically significant difference (p \u00bc 0.0027). In a multiple logistic regression model, neutropenia (OR \u00bc 22.7) and the presence of a central venous catheter (OR \u00bc 8.5) were independent predictors of the development of bacteremia [75] . Hambleton et al. compared the outcomes of HIV-infected inpatients who developed neutropenia after treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy and those who developed neutropenia for other reasons from 1987 to 1990. In their cohort, few patients received filgrastim, and most patients were white men who had sex with men. They found no statistically significant difference in the rates of bacteremia or mortality between the two groups in both bivariate analysis and in multiple logistic regression models [70] . At the same center, but examining a different time period (1992-1993), Jacobsen et al. examined the rates of hospitalization for HIV-infected outpatients stratified by ANC, using ICD-9 codes to evaluate for the presence of infection. A total of 2047 outpatients were analyzed for this study. A progressive and statistically significant increase in the risk of hospitalization was noted as the nadir ANC decreased. The number of days hospitalized per 10,000 days of risk increased from 61 for patients whose ANC was always >0.5 \u00c2 10 9 /L during the study period to 487 for patients with ANC nadir <0.3 \u00c2 10 9 /L [71] .",

Subsequently, 177 neutropenic patients from this cohort were compared with 177 non-neutropenic controls matched for initial CD4 + lymphocyte count and duration of follow-up. Although, in unadjusted analysis, neutropenia was associated with increased odds of developing infection (OR 3.29), this association disappeared in a multiple logistic regression model which also included clinical stage of AIDS and hemoglobin concentration [80] .",

Although no randomized trial specifically has addressed the use of filgrastim in HIV-associated malignancy, several nonrandomized comparative studies looking at the benefits of adding rHuG-CSF to a chemotherapy regimen in patients with HIV-associated lymphoma have been published. In a pre-and postintervention trial where 65 HIV-infected patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) either received a dose-reduced variant of the CHOP regimen (chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) or full-dose CHOP augmented by filgrastim, grade 3 or 4 neutropenia occurred in fewer patients receiving full-dose CHOP with filgrastim (13% vs. 25%), a nonsignificant difference. The study was neither intended to nor powered to measure the effect of filgrastim independently [100] . A similar, nonrandomized study by Rossi found that HIV-positive patients receiving rHuG-CSF during chemotherapy were more likely than those who did not to receive full doses of chemotherapy and to receive cycles without delays, although the likelihood of complete response was actually lower in those who received rHuG-CSF [101] . A third study, also nonrandomized, compared the outcomes of HIV-positive patients undergoing chemotherapy for NHL, finding a decrease in mean duration of treatment delays between cycles from 9d to 4d (p \u00bc 0.01). Again, however, mean duration of survival was worse in the group receiving rHuG-CSF, which also trended toward having more advanced HIV [102] . Further discussion of the role of rHuG-CSF in HIV-associated malignancies is beyond the scope of this chapter; a review of the use of hematopoietic growth factors in HIV-associated malignancies has been previously published [103] .",

Although generally safe, filgrastim usage in HIV patients has been associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation [105] , hepatitis, and pancreatitis [106] . In non-HIV patients, a review of case reports of adverse effects of filgrastim noted a number of rare adverse events, many of which were attributed to increased inflammation (ARDS, shock, worsening autoimmune disease) or leukostasis (arterial thrombosis or myocardial infarction, interstitial nephritis, bone marrow necrosis) [107] . Nevertheless, the adverse effect of filgrastim that serves as the biggest barrier to its use is its cost. However, filgrastim may be effective in HIV-infected patients at doses lower than those traditionally used for patients with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia [108] . One center developed a clinical pharmacist-driven protocol for dosing filgrastim in HIV-infected inpatients based on ANC; subsequently, the quarterly cost for filgrastim for the HIV service decreased from US$90,000 to US$22,000 [109] .",
