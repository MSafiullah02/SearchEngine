The relationship between the presence of infection (bacterial and/or viral) and the intensity of airway inflammation was also investigated. Sputum levels of IL\u20108 and TNF\u2010\u03b1 were assessed because of their likely important roles in modulating/mediating neutrophilic inflammation in COPD, and sputum concentrations of secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) were measured because of its protective function in the airway against harmful products of polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) activation, and its potential role in facilitating the resolution of inflammation in COPD.\n2\n, \n11\n, \n12\n, \n13\n, \n14\n\n",

This was accompanied by a highly significant improvement in airway anti\u2010protease defences, as indicated by the increase in SLPI levels. There was little further improvement in these sputum inflammatory indices after 48 h. The rapid decrease in sputum neutrophils may suggest a direct effect of CS, perhaps mediated by downregulation of chemokines, such as IL\u20108 and inhibition of PMN\u2010related adhesion molecule expression on pulmonary blood vessels.\n25\n, \n26\n Arguing against the first of these explanations was the poor relationship between changes in sputum IL\u20108 and PMN numbers. However, there was a positive relationship between changes in sputum PMN numbers and TNF\u2010\u03b1 levels. Airway epithelial cells produce TNF\u2010\u03b1 in response to a variety of stimuli, including bacterial infection.\n27\n The expression of key neutrophil\u2010related adhesion molecules such as intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)\u20101 and E\u2010selectin on vascular endothelial cells is upregulated by TNF\u2010\u03b1, and potential inhibition by CS of TNF\u2010\u03b1 production may be one of the ways in which neutrophils are cleared from the airway during the acute phase of AECOPD, but this needs further study.\n28\n, \n29\n, \n30\n, \n31\n\n",

This was particularly so in current smokers experiencing an AECOPD, suggesting that the expected upregulation of airway anti\u2010protease defences in response to acute inflammation was either deficient or that consumption by the products of neutrophil activation exceeded the capacity of the airways to compensate. The inverse relationship between SLPI and sputum neutrophils on admission would support the latter explanation. However, the increase in sputum SLPI levels over 48 h was not directly related to the accompanying reduction in sputum neutrophil numbers. One explanation for this may be that CS therapy directly upregulates SLPI production by airway epithelial cells, as has been demonstrated in vitro in epithelial cell cultures.\n32\n\n",

Indeed, on reviewing the decision\u2010making process for discharge of these patients, it was quite evident that lung function was not a factor\u2014as it would be, for example, in acute asthma.

Although this may have allowed a more comprehensive analysis, there was nevertheless a very strong indication that infection with bacterial pathogens at the time of exacerbation was associated with a more intense innate immune response. There are suggestions that the key determinant of the local host immune response in the airways of COPD patients who are chronically colonized with bacteria, is the burden of infection, that is, the bacterial load.\n7\n, \n8\n, \n33\n, \n34\n Whether expression of bacterial virulence factors is also important, especially at the time of an AECOPD, requires further investigation.\n35\n Ideally, patients should also have been assessed before they were treated with CS or antibiotics; however, the vast majority of patients in this study had received both these treatments before admission. Prospective studies of individuals with COPD in the expectation that they will experience an exacerbation are logistically difficult and require large numbers and lengthy follow up to ensure adequate numbers of patients actually experience an exacerbation.
