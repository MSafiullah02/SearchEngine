Human mobility and relevant production and consumption activities have since decreased significantly. As a likely side effect of this decrease, many regions have recorded significant reductions in air pollution. We employed daily air pollution data and Intracity Migration Index (IMI) data form Baidu between 1 January and 21 March 2020 for 44 cities in northern China to examine whether, how, and to what extent travel restrictions affected air quality. On the basis of this quantitative analysis, we reached the following conclusions: (1) The reduction of air pollution was strongly associated with travel restrictions during this pandemic-on average, the air quality index (AQI) decreased by 7.80%, and five air pollutants (i.e., SO 2 , PM 2.5 , PM 10 , NO 2 , and CO) decreased by 6.76%, 5.93%, 13.66%, 24.67%, and 4.58%, respectively. (2) Mechanism analysis illustrated that the lockdowns of 44 cities reduced human movements by 69.85%, and a reduction in the AQI , PM 2.5 , and CO was partially mediated by human mobility, and SO 2 , PM 10 , and NO 2 were completely mediated. (3) Our findings highlight the importance of understanding the role of green production and consumption.",

This context provides us with a unique opportunity to examine the effects of human-related activities on air quality. Although satellite data have offered suggestive evidence of significant drops in air pollution concentration during lockdowns, it is insufficient to understand the pollution reduction effects of the unprecedented quarantine resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak. Questions remain as to whether, how, and to what extent these interventions affected air quality. Instead, this work employs daily air pollution data (including air quality index [AQI] , SO 2 , PM 2.5 , PM 10 , NO 2 , and CO), daily weather data, real-time human mobility data, and lockdown time lines of 44 cities in north China from a span of 1 January and 21 March 2020 (covered 81 days) to estimate the effects of travel restrictions on air pollutants concentration. Particularly, we first employ Least Square J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f lockdowns. We also estimate the mediating effect of human mobility, measured by IMI index from Baidu, on the relationship between the lockdowns and air pollution.",

This result indicated that after the government implemented travel bans, human mobility dropped by 69.85%. From model (2), we found that the coefficient of Ln_hunman_mobility was 0.0885, which was significantly positive at the 1% level, which suggested that the higher the human mobility was associated with heavier air pollution. The results in models (4), (6), (8), (10), and (12) also provided similar evidence. We next observed the results when the mediator (human mobility) was controlled. As illustrated in Table 6 , we found substantial evidence for the mediating role of human mobility in the relationship between travel restrictions and air pollution concentration. In particular, we noticed that the coefficient of lnaqi dropped from 0.0780 in Table 1 to 0.0429 in Table 6 , combined with a decrease in the significance level (from 99% in Table 1 to 95% in Table 6 ). lnpm25 and lnco showed analogous evidence with lnaqi, which indicated that the effects of the travel ban on the reduction in AQI and the concentrations of PM 2.5 and CO were partially mediated by the sharp decline of the volume of individual movements. Surprisingly, we also J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f found that the coefficients of lnso2, lnpm10, and lnno2 became insignificant statistically compared with the results in Table 1 , demonstrating that the impact of transmission control measures on the decrease in concentrations of SO 2 , PM 10 , and NO 2 was completely mediated by human movement.

We further calculated the average of Intracity Migration Index (IMI) of 44 cities and employed Stata 16.0 software to graphically portray the variations of IMI index as a visual demonstration (see Fig. 5), To save the space, we additionally present city-specific IMI index variation figures in Appendix A.

An interesting pattern revealed inFig. 5is that the human mobility within cities had a clear tendency toward the establishment of the cordon sanitaire. More specifically, before implementing quarantine measures for citizens or visitors, we observed a similar trend between 2019 and 2020, and the degree of traveling in 2020 was a little higher than that in 2019. In contrast, once cities imposed travel restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the downward trend in the IMI index for 2020 became particularly apparent compared with 2019. As illustrated inFig. 5, human mobility rapidly decreased to almost no movement after the implementation of the shutdown.
