            "text": "Self-assembly is the process by which components are spontaneously organized into ordered structures without external intervention (Whitesides and Grzybowski, 2002). Self-assembly phenomena are ubiquitous in nature, especially in biological systems including peptides, proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids (Whitesides and Grzybowski, 2002, Zhang, 2003). Inspired by nature, molecular self-assembly processes are intensively exploited to create novel nanoscale biomaterials. Drexler (1981) first proposed that engineered proteins could be used as monomeric building blocks to fabricate devices through self-assembly approaches. Since then peptides and proteins have become abundant and versatile building blocks (Gazit, 2007, Rajagopal and Schneider, 2004, Subramani et al., 2008, Toks\u00f6z and Guler, 2009, Tsai et al., 2007, Yang et al., 2009, Zhang, 2002, Zhang et al., 2002). They are now used to engineer nanorings (Carlson et al., 2006), nanotubes (Scanlon and Aggeli, 2008), nanofibrils (Yang et al., 2009, Zhang, 2002, Zhang, 2003, Zhang et al., 2002), nanoparticles (Kaba et al., 2009, Raman et al., 2006, Raman et al., 2009) and other ordered structures at the nanoscale (Carlson et al., 2006). They can also form mesoscopic and macroscopic structures with nanoscale order (Whitesides and Boncheva, 2002), such as monolayers (Rapaport et al., 2000), hydrogels (Petka et al., 1998) and three-dimensional scaffolds (Holmes, 2002, Zhang et al., 2005). Peptides and proteins possess many advantages, such as biocompatibility, chemical diversity and bioactivity. Thus, self-assembling peptides and proteins have enormous potential applications in the field of nano-biotechnology.",

Some well-known examples are the coiled-coil domains of the GCN4 leucine zipper (O\u2019Shea et al., 1991), fibritin (Tao et al., 1997), tetrabrachion (Stetefeld et al., 2000), and the cartilage oligomerization matrix protein (COMP) (Malashkevich et al., 1996), which represent dimeric, trimeric, tetrameric, and pentameric coiled coils, respectively. \u03b1-Helical coiled coils are convenient building blocks for the design of self-assembling nanostructures. We have designed a novel type of self-assembling polypeptide nanoparticle (SAPN) with well-defined size and shape using the slightly modified pentameric coiled-coil domain of COMP and a de novo-designed trimeric coiled-coil domain in which the two oligomerization domains are joined by a two-glycine residue linker (Raman et al., 2006). The design was based on an icosahedral model (Padilla et al., 2001, Raman et al., 2006) in which the two rotational symmetry axes from the pentameric and trimeric coiled-coil domains are superpositioned onto the fivefold and threefold symmetry axes of the icosahedron. Upon formation of the coiled coils from the two oligomerization domains, the peptides self-assemble into nanoparticles. Ideally the SAPN would have icosahedral symmetry and accommodate 60 peptide chains per particle in a T\n = 1 icosahedron (Fig. 1D, top), or 180 chains in a T\n = 3-like icosahedron (Fig. 1\nD, bottom).",

Peptide epitopes can easily be engineered at either end of the peptide sequence of the SAPN, which results in the repetitive display of epitopes, which in turn is able to generate a strong immune response (Fehr et al., 1998). For example such SAPNs have been used as a platform to present the tandem repeat of the B cell immunodominant repeat epitope (DPPPPNPN)2D of the circumsporozoite protein of the malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei (Kaba et al., 2009), the HRC1 epitope of the spike protein from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (Pimentel et al., 2009), and the hydrophobic loop of actin (Schroeder et al., 2009). All of these studies have demonstrated that specific immune responses towards the projected epitopes were elicited by the repetitive display of the epitopes on the surface of the SAPNs, indicating the potential of the SAPN as an antigen display system in the design of novel vaccines.",

To obtain further information, quantitative dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) was employed to measure the molecular masses of the SAPNs. This single molecule technique determines the mass of individual particles from images of unstained samples by integrating the electron scattering with appropriate background subtraction (see Section 2). Further, the images allow mass to be directly linked to particle shape. The mass of over 300 P6c SAPNs was determined (Fig. 4\nA). The resulting histogram indicates the presence of one major and several minor particle populations. Accordingly, most of the SAPNs (63.5%) have a mass of 2.23 (\u00b10.46) MDa (SE, \u00b10.03 MDa; overall uncertainty, \u00b10.12 MDa), and with few exceptions, almost circular projections (Fig. 4B). The smaller particle populations have masses of 3.76, 4.41 and 6.76 (\u00b10.46) MDa, respectively and their projections are larger, generally elongated and sometimes clearly arise from particle association. The results indicate that most SAPNs are indeed almost spherical in shape. Deviations might be due to the presence of the N-terminal sequence of 22 amino acids containing the His-tag. This sequence does not form a coiled coil but rather is a flexible peptide at the surface of the SAPN. SAPNs with a particle mass of 2.23 MDa must be formed by approximately 180 peptide chains (177 \u00b1 10 considering the overall uncertainty), which would correspond to a T\n = 3 icosahedron-like structure. The small population with a particle mass of 3.76 MDa (SE, \u00b10.07 MDa; overall uncertainty, \u00b10.20 MDa) indicated by the second histogram peak must comprise approximately 300 peptide chains, which is in accordance with their somewhat elongated structure; this might be a unique structure or, as evident for some of the projections, arise from the association of two lower mass SAPNs. The SAPNs in the third and fourth peaks have more irregular shapes and appear to be aggregated particles of roughly the same size as those giving rise to peak 1.",

The influence of additional salt at various concentrations on the self-assembly process of the P6c peptide was examined first, using buffers containing 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5 and 5% glycerol and various NaCl concentrations. The SAPNs formed were quite homogeneous and, as judged from their almost circular projections on TEM images, spherical in buffers with NaCl concentrations up to 300 mM (Fig. 5\nA\u2013F). At 500 mM NaCl the SAPNs were less homogeneous and were prone to aggregate (Fig. 5G). Overall, the average size of the SAPNs determined by DLS and TEM increased with increasing salt concentration. The average hydrodynamic size of the SAPNs formed changed from 20 nm (width 7.5 nm) to 35 nm (width 17.7 nm), when the NaCl concentration increased from 0 to 500 mM (Fig. 5H). This was corroborated by the particle dimensions measured by TEM; the average particle diameter increased from 19 \u00b1 3 nm (n\n = 145) at 0 mM NaCl to 31 \u00b1 7 nm (n\n = 69) at 500 mM NaCl (Fig. 5I).

The P6c peptide was refolded in five different buffers ranging from pH 7.0 to pH 9.0 (see Section 2). As judged from the almost circular projections on TEM images, the peptide self-assembled into the nicest spherical SAPNs at pH 7.5\u20138.0 (Fig. 6\nB\u2013C). Aggregation occurred at pH 7.0 (Fig. 6A). At pH 8.5 (Fig. 6D) SAPN morphology changed slightly and there was a background of smaller particles possibly because self-assembly was not so efficient. There was again aggregation at pH 9.0 (Fig. 6E). As might be expected from these images, analysis by DLS showed that the SAPNs formed at pH 7.5, 8.0 and 8.5 had similar average hydrodynamic sizes of about 30 nm. The average hydrodynamic sizes were larger at pH 7.0 (80 nm) and at pH 9.0 (37 nm) (Fig. 6F, G). The size distribution of the SAPNs at pH 7.0 and 9.0 was broader than at pH 7.5\u20138.5 most likely due to the onset of aggregation.

Many of the SAPNs have elongated shapes at low glycerol concentrations of 0% and 2.5% and form rope-like structures (Fig. 7\nA and B). From the almost circular projections on TEM images, spherical and discrete SAPNs are formed at the intermediate glycerol concentrations of 5% and 10% (Fig. 7C and D), while at higher glycerol concentration (15%) the SAPNs have irregular shapes and start to aggregate (Fig. 7E). According to DLS experiments the smallest average hydrodynamic size of the SAPNs, 28 nm, was obtained at 5% glycerol (Fig. 7F and G). The size distribution of the SAPNs was also narrowest at 5% glycerol.

The hydrophobic interactions along the coiled-coil interface are the main driving force for coiled-coil formation. Many other factors also contribute to their stability. For example, coiled coils can be stabilized by a complex network of inter- and intrahelical salt bridges (Burkhard et al., 2000a, Burkhard et al., 2002, Meier and Burkhard, 2006, Meier et al., 2010). Indeed, removing a single interhelical salt bridge can even abolish coiled-coil formation (Meier et al., 2002). The geometry between the pentameric and trimeric coiled coils formed on P6c oligomerization is important for SAPN formation (Fig. 1). This geometry is constrained by the conformation of the residues around the two-glycine residue linker (Fig 1B) and influenced by interactions with the neighboring coiled coils as SAPNs form, which can be hydrophobic, electrostatic, hydrogen bonding and Van der Waals in nature. All of these non-covalent interactions are affected by the buffer conditions employed such as salt concentration, pH, temperature, and co-solvents e.g., glycerol. Glycerol is a very commonly used co-solvent, and is thought to decrease the diffusivity and the partial molar volume of proteins inhibiting aggregation (Meng et al., 2001). The large increases in solvent viscosity it causes are accompanied by relatively small changes of the pH and dielectric constant (Schein, 1990).",

If formed by P6c as predicted, SAPNs with the T\n = 1 icosahedral symmetry (Fig. 1D, top; Raman et al., 2006) would have a diameter of 20 nm and accommodate 60 peptides. In the original design, two cystein residues present (Fig. 1A) either formed intramolecular disulfide bonds giving the SAPNs a degree of angular rigidity (Raman et al., 2006, Zandi et al., 2004) or, as experiment showed, intermolecular disulfide bonds leading to aggregation (Raman et al., 2006). Replacement of these two residues by alanine in P6c significantly reduced particle aggregation under close to native conditions (compare Fig. 3A with Fig. 3A of Raman et al., 2006). However, some particle heterogeneity was still visible on TEM images. This may be due to residual aggregation and/or be because the P6c SAPNs do not always have strict icosahedral symmetry. The increased flexibility of the two-glycine residue linker in the P6c peptide chain in the absence of the disulfide bridge, could make the latter possible; in P6c the two coiled-coil domains are no longer restrained, their relative angular orientation can vary and, as a consequence, the SAPNs can incorporate different numbers of peptide chains per particle leading to different nanoparticle sizes. These two scenarios, simple nanoparticle aggregation (i.e., two, three or more particles sticking together) versus a size increase because the geometry and stoichiometry of the nanoparticles changes (i.e., elongated structures formed), will give very similar results in some biophysical analyzes, e.g., in DLS experiments. Thus, the DLS measurements made in the present work to obtain the overall average hydrodynamic radius of the nanoparticles present in the P6c under different conditions, were complemented by electron micrsoscopy. Negative stain TEM generally sufficed; SAPNs formed in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, i.e., under close to physiological conditions, were also examined by STEM. As illustrated by Fig. 4, STEM is a powerful method to directly correlate the measured molecular weight of a particle to its shape. The main peak at 2.2 (\u00b10.5) MDa in the mass-distribution clearly corresponds to relatively uniform spherical particles, while the smaller less well-defined peaks at higher molecular weights frequently arise from multiple nanoparticles sticking together (Fig. 4). Accordingly, the mass values of peaks 3 and 4 are also close multiples of 2.23 MDa. SAPNs with a particle mass of 2.23 MDa must be formed by approximately 180 peptide chains, implying that they have a T\n = 3 icosahedron-like structure with a predicted diameter of 25 nm (Fig 1D, bottom). This is in good agreement with the 27 or 28 nm average diameter indicated by TEM and DLS for SAPNS under close to physiological conditions. The second peak in the mass-distribution, 3.8 (\u00b10.5) MDa, implies the presence of particles with approximately 300 peptide chains, which may explain the somewhat elongated structure of some SAPNs. This might be an infrequent unique structure or, as evident for some of the projections, arise from the association of two lower mass SAPNs. It should be noted that the various species documented by STEM were necessarily measured together in the bulk DLS experiment, which will have broadened the single peak obtained and increased the estimated average hydrodynamic size.",

            "text": "The TEM and DLS analyzes of P6c SAPNs formed under different conditions revealed some clear trends and showed that the size distribution of the various species in the samples is influenced by the refolding conditions. The effect of salt concentration was particularly marked indicating that the ionic strength of the buffer solution is important (Fig. 5); larger SAPNs are favored at higher salt concentrations (up to 300 mM NaCl) and above a given ionic strength (between 300 and 500 mM NaCl) particle aggregation becomes more pronounced. The observed size and shape variability of the single nanoparticles probably reflects changes in the geometric packing of the trimeric and pentameric coiled coils of P6c under the different conditions. In the absence of the disulfide bridge of the original construct (compare Fig. 1A and B), the relative angular orientation of these coiled coils will be more sensitive to changes in the interactions within the SAPN (see above). This would explain why the size of the nanoparticles varies and why under certain conditions they appear to be slightly elongated. Both, the stoichiometry and the spacing between coiled-coil neighbors could vary or just one of them. High stoichiometry coupled to decreased coiled-coil spacing would result in the highest possible density of epitopes on SAPN decoration. The SAPNs assembled under close to physiological conditions and in many of the other experiments were larger than expected from the proposed T\n = 1 icosahedral model (Fig. 1D, top). In agreement, as mentioned above STEM indicated three times the expected stoichiometry, 180 peptide chains rather than 60, compatible with a T\n = 3 icosahedal SAPN structure (Fig. 1D, bottom). This will be reflected by the number of epitopes displayed on decoration. Even though the diameter of the particle is larger, the net epitope density at the surface will be higher than the density predicted by the T\n = 1 icosahedral model.",
