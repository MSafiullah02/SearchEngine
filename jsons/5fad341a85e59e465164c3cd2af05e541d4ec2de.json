The aminopeptidase-N activity of BBMVs was measured as the hydrolysis of L-leucine p-nitroanilide. The specific activity was 35 units/mg protein. The BBMV preparation also showed low level of alkaline phosphatase activity. Zn \u03e9\u03e9 chelating agents 2,2\u0408-dipyridyl and 1,10-phenanthroline inhibited aminopeptidase activity at 10 mM concentration, indicating the presence of zinc-dependent aminopeptidase in the brush border of H. armigera. The aminopeptidase activity was increased with increasing concentration of \u2426-endotoxin. The purified 120-kDa binding protein was N-terminally sequenced.

When these ICPs are ingested by the susceptible insect, they are first solubilized in the alkaline and reducing environment of the insect midgut and then processed by the midgut proteases to form the activated toxin. The activated toxin binds to receptors on the surface of the midgut epithelial cells of a susceptible insect and results in the rapid inhibition of K \u03e9 -dependent amino acid transport [18] . Changes in the permeability of the midgut membrane [9] and eventually lysis of the midgut cells result in death of the insect [15] . Brush border membrane vesicles are used to study the receptor binding and mode of action of Bt toxin in vitro [27] . It has been shown that B. thuringiensis toxins bind with high affinity to specific binding molecules present in the brush border membranes of susceptible insects [22] . In H. armigera the target of Bt insecticidal crystal protein is the brush border membrane of midgut cells. The bound toxin disrupts the midgut epithelial cells causing lysis [10] . Lepidoptcran insects have one or more toxin binding proteins. Cry lAc binding protein of 120 kDa and a Cry lAb binding protein of 205 kDa were shown in Manduca sexta [6, 23] . Heliothis virescens has toxin-binding proteins ranging from 45 to 170 kDa [4, 6, 12, 16] . The receptor for B. thuringiensis Cry lAc \u2426-endotoxin in the brush border membrane of the lepidoptera Manduca sexta was shown to be the metalloprotease aminopeptidase-N [11] .",

The enzymatic properties of this receptor protein were studied by the aminopeptidase assay. The specific activity of the purified protein was found to be 35 units/mg protein. The BBMV preparation showed alkaline phosphatase activity as well. The level of alkaline phosphatase activity was 5 units/mg protein. The purified protein did not show alkaline phosphatase activity [ Table  1 ]. The effect of Zn \u03e9\u03e9 chelating agents on the activity of aminopeptidase from BBMV was studied. The Zn \u03e9\u03e9 chelating agents 2,2-dipyridyl and 1,10-phenanthroline inhibited 42 and 51% aminopeptidase activity respectively at 1 mM concentration. At 10 mM concentration of these inhibitors, there was complete inhibition of aminopeptidase activity [ Table 2 ]. The 120-kDa protein has the characteristics of aminopeptidase-N. Aminopeptidase-N is a Zn \u03e9\u03e9 -dependent dependent ectoenzyme existing in relatively high abundance in the brush border of many animals. Mammalian forms of intestinal aminopepti- dase-N occur as monomers of 120 -140 kDa proteins, which are associated with 95, 66, and 45 kDa breakdown products [17] . It was reported that toxin-binding protein acts by increasing the toxin concentration at the membrane surface microenvironment, resulting in pore formation at low concentration of toxin [5, 11] . The effect of Cry1Ac \u2426-endotoxin on the aminopeptidase activity was studied by adding increasing concentrations of \u2426-en-dotoxin in the assay system. The aminopeptidase activity was increased with increasing concentrations of \u2426-endotoxin up to 60 g, but further concentrations lowered the enzyme activity to its original level. \u2426-Endotoxin by itself does not have aminopeptidase activity. Those \u2426-endotoxin which bind to the receptor enhance aminopeptidase activity. Inactive toxin did not show any increase in aminopeptidase activity [Fig. 3 ].",

Aminopeptidase catalyzes the removal of N-terminal neutral amino acids [8] . Aminopeptidase is a common component of lepidoptera larval midgut and is used as a marker enzyme to assess the purity of BBMVs from insect larval guts [26] . Correlation between toxicity and binding ability of BBMV to the Bt toxin was also reported [2] . The generally accepted theory for the mode of action of B. thuringiensis \u2426-endotoxin postulates that, after binding to a receptor in the insect midgut, the toxin undergoes a conformational change and inserts into the membrane to form a pore [11] .
