As such, there is an increased probability for critical care providers to encounter cancer patients within the intensive care unit (ICU). Furthermore, oncologic patients require increased utilization of resources in the ICU due to diseaserelated complications and/or treatment-related adverse events [124] . Metabolic complications present difficult challenges in the management of critically ill cancer patients [72] . Immunosuppression, secondary to the cancer itself or cancer-related therapies (e.g., chemotherapy, corticosteroids, hematopoietic cell transplant, etc.), places patients at an increased risk for infection. In addition, many new chemotherapy and targeted therapies have numerous adverse effects that not only increase the risk for ICU admission but require multiple other therapies to help manage these side effects.",

Accordingly, avoidance and detection of drug-drug interactions and overlapping adverse effect profiles is of high concern. The intent of this chapter is to provide critical care practitioners with an overview of non-chemotherapy medications that are frequently encountered during the care of a critically ill cancer patient in hopes of increasing awareness of such therapy. It should be emphasized that this chapter is not all-inclusive in respect to the medications discussed and details provided, and clinicians are advised to seek additional information as applicable.

While initial therapy of patients with febrile neutropenia may not require coverage for MRSA, empiric antibiotic regimens for all patients progressing to sepsis or septic shock or those patients with additional risk factors should be broadened to include an agent targeting aerobic gram positive cocci [102] . For MRSA, consider early addition of vancomycin, linezolid, or daptomycin. For VRE, consider early addition of linezolid or daptomycin. Selection of a specific agent should be based on patient-specific (e.g., end organ function) as well as an infection-specific factors (e.g., source of infection). As mentioned in Table 2 , use of linezolid may compromise bone marrow function; this does not preclude use of linezolid in patients with pancytopenia or thrombocytopenia, but it does justify a risk-benefit analysis inclusive of alternative options prior to therapy initiation [126] . Consider an infectious diseases (ID) consult if MRSA or VRE is isolated in the context of systemic infection [11, 43] . Discontinuation of MRSA and/or VRE therapy should be considered if a pathogen is not identified within 48-72 h of obtaining all pertinent cultures.",

Initial empiric coverage of extended spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) organisms and carbapenem resistant enterobacteraciae (CRE) should be based on patient-specific factors including prior exposure of antipseudomonal prophylaxis for febrile neutropenia patients and prior infections or microbiologic culture results. Double antipseudomonal gram-negative coverage may be warranted in patients with a history of P. aeruginosa or other MDR organism colonization or in hemodynamically unstable patients. Combination therapy with an aminoglycoside should be preferred in patients recently treated with fluoroquinolone prophylaxis ( Table 2 ) [11] .

Infection with herpes simplex (HSV), herpes zoster (HZ), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and respiratory viruses (e.g., respiratory syncytial virus [RSV] ) are of prominent concern. A review of the pharmacologic options for management of these infections is presented in Table 3 . Many oncology patients admitted in the ICU may already be receiving antiviral prophylaxis against herpes simplex virus (HSV) and herpes zoster (HZ) with acyclovir or valacyclovir. In addition to HSV/HZ, another common pathogen observed in patients with hematologic malignancy/post-HCT is cytomegalovirus (CMV). CMV is a beta herpes virus with a seroprevalence in the United States (US) of around 60% [130] . Typically, most people are asymptomatic when primary infection with CMV occurs and then the virus enters a latent infectious state in mononuclear leukocytes. Reactivation can occur in many instances, but in relation to the oncology patient population, this can be seen during times of immunosuppression (e.g., chemotherapy administration) and critical illness as well as in the elderly [34] . Prophylaxis against CMV is not routine, given the toxicity profile of traditional anti-CMV therapy (i.e., ganciclovir and foscarnet); rather a strategy of pre-emptive monitoring has been adopted with treatment reserved for patients with presumed or documented infection [136] . Recently, the Federal Drug Agency (FDA) approved letermovir for CMV prophylaxis in HCT CMV seropositive recipients. Given the more acceptable toxicity profile of this agent and the morbidity/mortality associated with CMV infection, use of letermovir will likely increase in hopes of preventing CMV reactivation [84] .",

Posaconazole or voriconazole are often utilized for prophylaxis against invasive aspergillosis in high-risk patients [29, 139, 146] . In the absence of contraindications (i.e., organ dysfunction, adverse effects) or development of a breakthrough infection, antifungal prophylactic regimens should be continued following ICU admission. For patients who develop breakthrough invasive aspergillosis while receiving prophylactic azole therapy, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) should be performed to assess adequacy of the current regimen, if available; however, the patient will likely need to be switched to another class of medications. Voriconazole remains the treatment of choice for Aspergillus infections (Table 4 ). However, if the patient is unable to tolerate voriconazole therapy, isavuconazonium or the liposomal formulation of Amphotericin B (AmB) are [101] .",

Selection of an antiepileptic drug (AED) warrants special consideration in the oncologic patient due to interactions with chemotherapy, side effects, and unique mechanisms of certain brain tumors. Enzyme inducing anticonvulsants such as phenytoin may lead to insufficient serum levels of concomitantly administered chemotherapy. Conversely, enzyme inhibiting anticonvulsants such as valproate may lead to toxic levels of chemotherapy [17] . AEDs that are substrates for P-gp (phenobarbital, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, topiramate, and felbamate) may result in insufficient intraparenchymal levels [88] . Patients with brain tumors are more prone to refractory epilepsy, requiring the use of multiple AEDs with different mechanisms. With the introduction of more well-tolerated AEDs, many practitioners are avoiding enzyme inducers as first-line agents [88] . While non-CYP-450 enzyme-inducing AEDs such as levetiracetam, gabapentin, and lamotrigine may be preferable in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, levetiracetam may be preferred as an initial option in the ICU as it is available for IV administration, does not appear to be affected by P-gp expression, and has favorable pharmacokinetic properties (Table 6 ) [57, 142] .",

Severe SOS is associated with a mortality rate greater than 80% [27] . SOS is characterized by a prothrombotic, hypofibrinolytic state as a result of endothelial damage and hepatocellular injury to sinusoidal endothelial cells. Hallmark symptoms include weight gain, painful hepatomegaly, fluid retention/ascites, and hyperbilirubinemia; the reported incidence varies in part due to variable definitions and evaluated populations [36] . SOS is a complication that occurs typically within 3 weeks of a myeloablative HCT but can also be observed in patients with risk factors of pre-existing liver disease, total body irradiation or abdominal/liver radiation, or exposure to certain hepatotoxic drugs, such as inotuzumab or gemtuzumab (list of VOD/SOS risk factors is not all-inclusive) [27, 36] . Defibrotide was FDA approved in the United States in 2016 for the treatment of severe hepatic SOS after publication of a pivotal phase III trial [117] . Its proposed mechanism of action is to reduce endothelial cell activation and injury and promote restoration of the thrombo-fibrinolytic balance [116] . Due to the severity of illness associated with SOS, many patients are transferred to the ICU for continued management and administration of defibrotide (Table 9 ).",
