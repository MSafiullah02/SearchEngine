Until April 14 th , 2020, COVID-19 has affected ~1,950,000 patients in 210 countries and territories around the world and 2 international conveyances and caused ~122,000 deaths in 162 countries/territories 1 . However, the epidemiologic data differs across countries. Although China showed the first case and a higher rate of morbidity and mortality than other sites, the number of new cases per day in China has been less than that elsewhere since February 26, 2020. Further studies and continued monitoring are needed to better understand the underlying mechanism of COVID-19. In addition, United States of America (USA) exceeded the number of cases observed in China on March 28 th , 2020 with more than 590,000 COVID-19 patients and ~24,000 deaths, followed by Spain (~172,000 patients and ~18,000 deaths), Italy (~160,000 patients and ~20,000 deaths), France (~137,000 patients and ~15,000 deaths), Germany (~130,000 patients and ~3,000 deaths), United Kingdom (~94,000 patients and ~12,000 deaths) and Iran (~75,000 patients and ~4,700 deaths) by April 14 th , 2020. Several effective measures including restricting travel from China, controlling the distribution of masks, extensive research of COVID-19 spread, and government efforts to inform and educate the public were aggressively conducted in Taiwan 2 . This is probably the reason why there were only 39 cases (until February 29 th , 2020) with a daily cumulative index of one case per day in Taiwan, which was much lower than that of nearby countries, such as Republic of Korea and Japan 2 .",

As discussed by the authors, some conditions are closely related to the Italian situation such as the size of the aged population (23.1% of citizens from Italy versus 13.5% in Brazil), the presence of concomitant serious diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ischemic heart disease, smoking habit, number of intensive care units (ICUs) beds and sub intensive care beds along with the quality of the health service.

All regions in Brazil have already seen COVID-19 cases and there is no medical support for all which takes into consideration particular state characteristics. In addition, Brazil does not have formal data on ICU beds and sub intensive care beds; besides that, the number of beds is distributed between private and public health systems. The number of patients needing the public health system is higher than for private health care. In the early stages of COVID-19 disease, before community infection, the number of hospitalizations in the private system was higher than in public health system conforming with the disease origin and type of infection and its placement. Between the Influenza virus subtype (H1N1) pandemic (2009) and COVID-19, Brazil lost ~34,500 hospital beds.

The undiagnosed patients relate to a higher index of infection and dissemination within the population which negatively affects disease control, postpones quarantine, and has further negative effects on the economy. The use of realtime PCR to confirm the disease may be the best choice for isolating confirmed patients and giving time to treat severe patients at UTIs. In this context, the main issue in treating COVID-19 is when to start the treatment and to isolate the patients with positive real-time PCR even in the absence of clinical symptoms such as fever and cough. The country is not able to treat all patients correctly at the same time and due to that, Brazil is going through the first stages of the infection. Health professionals are worried about the next steps since the country is recording higher numbers of cases every day. Also, during the month of March and April, emerging new cases of bronchiolitis at pediatric age which need treatment, interventions and hospitalizations; in addition, the H1N1 and Dengue, both are a continuous health problem; for the public about the pandemic. Moreover, the population has a low adhesion to quarantine and Ministry Health recommendations. This may contribute to higher infection rates, high demand for ITUs and general collapse in health with many deaths that could be avoided.

There were some official declarations after a presidential visit to the American President Donald Trump accompanied by 20 individuals from Brazilian delegation, who were later diagnosed positive to COVID-19. At that time, some public demonstrations took place in favor of the Federal Government behavior. Despite that opportunity, members of the government did not agree with quarantine and greeted voters in front of the Republican Palace. On March 29 th , 2020, members of the government visited public places mitigating the measures stipulated by the Ministry of Health. Also, the Government included as a campaign measure the hashtag #OBrasilN\u00e3oPodeParar (#BrazilCannotStop). The campaign was removed from official media and the Government denied the disclosure of the advertisement. The discordance between the members of government's speeches including the follow main issues: the efficacy of Hydroxychloroquine and Chloroquine and its use to treat COVID-19, the need to quarantine all citizens instead of restrictions for risk groups only, the severity of the COVID-19 disease and its capacity for dispersion among people, the beliefs about the exclusively affecting patients above 60 years old or with a comorbidity, quarantine as a measure to postpone the number of infected patients vs. avoiding the infection.
