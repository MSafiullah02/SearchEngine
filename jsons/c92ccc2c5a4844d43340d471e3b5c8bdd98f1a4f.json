The prefusion trimer forms a tightly packed structure with three receptor-binding domains clamped down by a segment adjacent to the fusion peptide, significantly different from recently published structures of a stabilized S ectodomain trimer. The postfusion conformation is a rigid tower-like trimer, but decorated by N-linked glycans along its long axis with almost even spacing, suggesting possible involvement in a mechanism protecting the virus from host immune responses and harsh external conditions. These findings advance our understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 enters a host cell and may guide development of vaccines and therapeutics.",

            "text": "The current coronavirus outbreak has become a pandemic reaching nearly every country on the planet, with a high case-fatality rate and devastating social and economic consequences. Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped positive-stranded RNA viruses, including the two that caused previous outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), both with significant fatalities 1-3 , as well as several endemic common-cold viruses 4 . With a large number of similar viruses circulating in bats and camels [5] [6] [7] [8] For all enveloped viruses, membrane fusion is a key early step for entering host cells and establishing infection 10 . Although an energetically favorable process, membrane fusion has high kinetic barriers when two membranes approach each other, mainly due to repulsive hydration forces 11, 12 . For viral membrane fusion, free energy to overcome these kinetic barriers comes from refolding of virus-encoded fusion proteins from a primed, metastable prefusion conformational state to a stable, postfusion state [13] [14] [15] . The fusion protein for CoV is its spike (S) protein that decorates the virion surface as an extensive crown (hence, \"corona\"). The protein also induces neutralizing antibody responses and is therefore an important target for vaccine development 16 . The S protein is a heavily glycosylated type I membrane protein anchored in the viral membrane. It is first produced as a precursor that trimerizes and possibly undergoes cleavage, potentially by a furin-like protease, into two fragments: the receptor-binding fragment S1 and the fusion fragment S2 ( Fig. 1A ; ref 17 ). Binding through the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in S1 to a host cell receptor (e.g., angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) and further proteolytic cleavage at a second site in S2 (S2' site), by a serine protease TMPRSS2 18 or endosomal cysteine proteases cathepsins B and L (CatB/L), are believed to trigger possible dissociation of S1 and irreversible refolding of S2 into a postfusion conformation -a trimeric hairpin structure formed by heptad repeat 1 (HR1) and heptad repeat 2 (HR2) 19, 20 . These large structural rearrangements can bring together the viral and cellular membranes, ultimately leading to fusion of the two bilayers.",

            "text": "Since the first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was released 21 , several structures have been reported for S protein fragments, including its ectodomain stabilized in the prefusion conformation 22, 23 and RBD-ACE2 complexes [24] [25] [26] (Fig. S1 ), largely building upon the previous success of the structural biology of S proteins from other CoVs 20 . The stabilized S ectodomain of the new virus adopts an architecture almost identical to that of the SARS-CoV ectodomain, with S1 folding into four domains -NTD (N-terminal domain), RBD, and two CTDs (C-terminal domains) and protecting the prefusion conformation of S2 with HR1 bending back towards the viral membrane ( Fig. S1A and S1B). The RBD samples two distinct conformations -\"up\" representing a receptoraccessible state and \"down\" representing a receptor-inaccessible state. The structures of RBD-ACE2 complexes show that the RBD folds around a five-stranded \u03b2 sheet and presents a gently concave surface, which cradles the N-terminal lobe of ACE2, with a large interface mediated primarily by hydrophilic interactions (Fig. S1C and S1D). Other related structures representing the postfusion state of S2, exemplified by one derived from mouse hepatitis virus (Fig. S1E ) and a lower-resolution one from SARS-CoV ( Fig.   S1F ), suggest how the proposed structural rearrangements of S2 may proceed to promote membrane fusion and viral entry 27, 28 . Comparison of the pre-and post-fusion states reveals that HR1 undergoes a \"jack-knife\" transition that can insert the fusion peptide (FP) into the target cell membrane. Folding back of HR2 places the FP and transmembrane (TM) segments at the same end of the molecule; this proximity causes the membranes with which they interact to bend toward each other, effectively leading to membrane fusion. In the previous structures, the regions near the viral membrane are either not present or disordered, and yet they all appear to play critical structural and functional roles 29-33 . In the work reported here, we have expressed, in HEK293 cells, and purified a fulllength, fully wild-type form of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and determined two cryo-EM structures representing its prefusion and postfusion states, both derived from a single preparation solubilized in detergent. The prefusion structure is in the all-\"down\" configuration, and local differences from the structure of the soluble, stabilized ectodomain suggest that the latter may have antigenic properties that differ from those of the virion-borne spike. Spontaneous rearrangement to the postfusion conformation, documented here in the absence of any receptor, may also occur on the virion surface.",

These cells fused efficiently with cells transfected with an intact human ACE2 construct, even without addition of any extra proteases (Fig. S2) , suggesting that the S protein expressed on the cell surfaces is fully functional for membrane fusion. The fusion efficiency was not affected by the C-terminal strep-tag. To purify the full-length S protein, we lysed the cells and solubilized all membrane-bound proteins in detergent NP-40. The strep-tagged S protein was then captured on strep-tactin resin. The purified S protein eluted from a size-exclusion column as three distinct peaks (Fig. 1B) . When the peak fractions were analyzed by Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1C) , peak 1 contained both the uncleaved S precursor and the cleaved S1/S2 complex; peak 2 had primarily the cleaved but dissociated S2 fragment; and peak 3 included mainly the dissociated S1 fragment, as judged by N-terminal sequencing and western blot. Analysis by negative stain EM confirmed that particles resembling the prefusion S trimer dominated the peak 1 sample; those similar to the postfusion S2 were the major component of the peak 2 sample; and those in peak 3 had the size expected for a monomeric S1 (Fig. 1C) . Protein from all three peaks showed binding to soluble ACE2 ( Fig. S3) , as each species was not well separated from the others by gel filtration chromatography, but peak 1 showed the strongest binding, comparable to that for the purified soluble S ectodomain trimer, while peak 2 showed the weakest binding, since it contained mainly the S2 fragment. Binding by protein from peak 3 was weaker than that of protein from peak 1, suggesting that the ability of monomeric S1 to bind ACE2 is somewhat weakened as compared to the S trimer. While the cleavage at the S1/S2 (furin) site is clearly demonstrated by protein sequencing of the N-terminus of the S2 fragment in peak 2, cleavage at the S2' site is not obvious. We observed in some preparations a band around 20 kDa, a size expected for the S1/S2-S2' fragment ( Fig. 1C) . We obtained a similar gel filtration profile when another detergent (DDM) was used to solubilize the S protein, although the peaks were less well resolved than the NP-40 preparation (Fig. S4) , suggesting that the S protein dissociation is not triggered by any specific detergent.",

Our new structure appears to be more stable, however, because the N-terminus, several peripheral loops and glycans are ordered ( Fig.   2A and 2B), although invisible in those soluble trimer structures. As described previously, the S1 fragment has four domains, including NTD, RBD, CTD1 and CTD2 -which all wrap around the three-fold axis, covering the S2 fragment underneath. Since the furin cleavage site at the S1/S2 boundary is in a surface-exposed and disordered loop ( Fig. 2B) , we do not know whether this structure represents the uncleaved or cleaved trimer, although the sample clearly contains the both forms (Fig. 1C) . Nevertheless, the location of the furin site suggests that the cleavage may have little impact on the rest of the trimer structure, other than ultimately allowing complete dissociation of S1 fragment, which may be a key event that enables S2 refolding and membrane fusion. Likewise, the S2 fragment has a conformation nearly identical to that in the previous trimer structures, with most of the polypeptide chain packed around a central three-stranded coiled coil formed by CH, including the connector domain (CD), which links CH and the C-terminal HR2 through an additional linker region. Major differences between our new structure and the published trimer structures are that a ~25-residue segment in S2 immediately downstream of the fusion peptide is ordered and S density at the C-terminus extends further to Pro1162 before fading away. The remaining segments, including HR2, TM and CT, are still not visible, at least in the high resolution maps.",

It is not obvious why the FPPR is also not visible in the published, closed S ectodomain structure with all three RBDs in the down conformation 23 .

We do not know whether the S'2 site is cleaved or not in our structure since it is in a disordered region spanning 142 residues (Fig. 4B) , as in the MHV S2 structure. Nevertheless, the S1/S2-S2' fragment is an integral part of the postfusion structure and would not dissociate, regardless of cleavage at the S2' site. The N-terminal region of HR2 adopts a one-turn helical conformation and also packs against the groove of the HR1 coiled-coil; the C-terminal region of HR2 forms a longer helix that makes up the second six-helix bundle structure with the rest of the HR1 coiled-coil (6HB-2 in Fig.   4B ). Thus, the long central coiled-coil is reinforced multiple times along its long axis, making it a very rigid structure, as evident even from 2D class averages of particles in the cryo images (Fig. S7 ).",

If these glycosylation sites are fully occupied by branched sugars, they may shield most surfaces of the postfusion S2 trimer. A similar pattern has been recently described in a paper posted in ChinaXiv (http://www.chinaxiv.org/user/download.htm?id=30394) for a SARS-CoV S2 preparation derived from a soluble S ectodomain construct produced in insect cells and triggered by proteolysis and low pH.

Moreover, S protein has no obvious cellular homologs and functions by a unique mechanism, and it is thus a more probable target for inhibitors with high specificity but fewer side effects than inhibitors of the viral enzymes.

The smaller class gave a reconstruction at 3.4\u00c5 resolution while the large class led to a map at 3.5 \u00c5. The particles from the smaller class were subjected to CTF refinement and Bayesian polishing, followed by another round of 3D refinement, resulting in a reconstruction at 3.1\u00c5 resolution, which was used for structural interpretation. The particles from the larger class were reclassified without C3",

It would be important to confirm whether this region is folded in these constructs or simply poorly defined by density, despite a disulfide bond, particularly if they are widely used for vaccine studies.Second, another disulfide containing segment (residues 828-853), immediately downstream of the fusion peptide is also absent from the structures of the soluble ectodomain, but ordered in our new structure(Fig. 3B). We designate it as the fusion-peptide proximal region (FPPR). The FPPR is disordered in both the closed and one RBD-up conformations of the stabilized soluble S trimer. In our new structure of the full-length protein, it packs rather tightly around an internal disulfide bond between Cys840 and Cys851, further reinforced by a salt bridge between Lys835 and Asp848, as well as by an extensive hydrogen bond network. When compared with the RBD-up conformation by superposition of the rest of S2, the FPPR clashes with CTD1, which rotates outwards with RBD in the flipping-up transition. Thus, a structured FPPR,",

Whether or not this observation relates directly to efficient membrane fusion or infection, and perhaps effective transmission from human to human leading to the current pandemic, will require further investigation. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that the postfusion S2 trimer not only has a very stable and rigid structure, but also that it is strategically decorated with N-linked glycans along its long axis with almost even spacing, as if under selective pressure for functions other than as the end-ofmission (postfusion) stage in the membrane fusion process. Although some have suggested that viral fusion proteins may further oligomerize in their postfusion conformation to facilitate fusion pore formation37 , the protruding surface glycans of the SARS-CoV-2 S2 make this scenario unlikely. A more plausible possibility is a protective role that the S2 postfusion structure could play if it is also present on the surface of an infectious and mature virion. It may induce nonneutralizing antibody responses to evade the host immune system; it may also shield the more vulnerable prefusion S1/S2 trimers under conditions outside the host by decorating the viral surface with interspersed rigid spikes(Fig. 5A). Several recent reports have provided some evidence supporting this possibility. First, EM images of a \u03b2-propiolactone inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus preparation, purified by a potassium tartrate-glycerol density gradient, appeared to have lost all S1 subunits, leaving only the postfusion S2 on the virion surfaces38 . Likewise, EM images of a \u03b2-propiolactone inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus vaccine candidate (PiCoVacc) also showed needle-like spikes on its surfaces39 . Second, there are elongated spikes on the surfaces of live viruses in the images released to the news media (http://nmdc.cn/#/nCoV). Third, there are significantly higher antibody binding titers",

            "text": "of position due to intrinsic protein dynamics, allowing RBDs to sample the up conformation. A fluctuation of this kind would loosen the entire S trimer, as observed in modified soluble S trimer constructs22,23 . Once an RBD is fixed in the up position by binding to ACE2 on the surface of a target cell, a flexible FPPR may enable exposure of the S2' cleavage site immediately upstream of the adjacent fusion peptide. Cleavage at the S2' site releases the structural constraints on the fusion peptide, which may initiate a cascade of refolding events in S2, including formation of the long central three stranded coiled-coil, folding back of HR2 and ultimately membrane fusion. Cleavage at the S1/S2 site allows complete dissociation of S1, which may also facilitate S2 refolding.Puzzles regarding membrane fusion remain, as the regions near the viral membrane are still not visible in the reconstructions, even in our structures obtained using a full-length S construct. Yet these regions all play critical structural and functional roles. For example, the conserved hydrophobic region immediately preceding the TM domain, and possibly the TM itself, have been shown to be crucial for S protein trimerization and membrane fusion29 . The cytoplasmic tail, containing a palmitoylated cysteine-rich region, is believed to be involved in viral assembly and cell-cell fusion[30][31][32][33] . The HR2 is unlikely to be disordered on the surface of virion since most spikes appear to stand straightrelative to the viral membrane from the EM images of the virus. Whether other viral proteins, such M protein, may help stabilize the spike by interacting with the HR2 remains an interesting question. Thus, we still need a high-resolution structure of an intact S protein in the context of the membrane and other viral components to answer the various open questions.Considerations for vaccine developmentA safe and effective vaccine is the only medical option to reduce or eliminate the constant threat posed by SARS-CoV-2. The first round of vaccine candidates with various forms of the spike (S) protein of the virus, largely modeled on those designed against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV 1,16 , are passing rapidly through preclinical studies in animal models and clinical trials in humans. Our study raises several potential concerns about the current vaccine strategies. First, vaccines using the full-length wildtype sequence of S protein may produce the various forms in vivo that we have observed here. The postfusion conformations could expose immunodominant, nonneutralizing epitopes that distract the host immune system, as documented for other viruses, such as HIV-1 and RSV 41,42 . Second, the approach to stabilize the prefusion conformation by introducing proline mutations at residues 986 and 987 may not be optimal, as the K986P mutation may break a salt bridge between protomers that contributes to the trimer stability. The resulting S trimer structure with a relaxed apex may induce antibodies that could not efficiently recognize S trimer spikes on the virus. Third, in light of the possibility that the postfusion S2 is present on infectious virions, vaccines using \u03b2-propiolactone inactivated viruses may require additional quality control tests. Although the PiCoVacc appears to provide protection against challenges in nonhuman primates after three immunizations 39 , it is unclear how to minimize the number of the postfusion S2 trimers to avoid batch variations, because another preparation of \u03b2-propiolactone inactivated viruses has only the postfusion S2 on the surfaces, which may not elicit sufficient protective antibody responses. Furthermore, sobering lessons from development of SARS-CoV vaccines",
