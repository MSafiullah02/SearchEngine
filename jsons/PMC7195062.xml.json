            "text": "Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), which can provide effective respiratory or cardiac support, has been regarded as a rescue therapy for severe ARDS. ECMO therapy during the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic in 2009 appeared to benefit, with ECMO-treated patients with H1N1-related ARDS achieving a mortality of 21%, which greatly increased interest in its use (The Australia and New Zealand Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation, 2009). Another cohort study by using ECMO database of patients with H1N1-related ARDS showed that hospital mortality rate was 23.7% for ECMO-referred patients vs 52.5% for non-ECMO-referred patients (RR, 0.45 [95% CI, 0.26-0.79]; P = 0.006) when individual matching was used; 24.0% vs 46.7%, respectively (RR, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.31-0.81]; P = 0.008) when propensity score matching was used; and 24.0% vs 50.7%, respectively (RR, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.31-0.72]; P = 0.001) when GenMatch matching was used. These suggested that for patients with H1N1-related ARDS, ECMO-referred patients were associated with significantly lower hospital mortality compared with matched non-ECMO-referred patients (Noah et al., 2011). A clinical trial, named as CESAR, was encouraging as well (Peek et al., 2009). However, EOLIA Clinical Trial showed that 60\u00adday mortality with very severe ARDS patients was not significantly lower, yet was largely reduced in the ECMO group compared with the conventional mechanical ventilation group (35% vs 46%; RR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.55-1.04]; P = 0.09), but there was a 28% crossover to ECMO for failure of conventional mechanical ventilation, suggesting a lack of clinical equipoise (Combes et al., 2018). Otherwise, a post hoc Bayesian analysis of EOLIA with various assumptions of prior belief and knowledge about ECMO efficacy in ARDS had shown the posterior probability of a mortality reduction with ECMO in the EOLIA trial (Goligher et al., 2018). In 2018, a retrospectively study on middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) patients with refractory respiratory failure indicated that ECMO should be used as a rescue therapy, and ECMO group was associated with lower mortality in MERS patients with refractory hypoxemia compared with the conventional group (65 vs 100%, P = 0.02)(Alshahrani et al., 2018) (Table 1\n).",

However, there is little experience with using ECMO to support SARS-CoV-2-infected patients (Wang et al., 2020, Yang et al., 2020, Guqin et al., 2020, Guan et al., 2020, Huang et al., 2020). Most of studies didn\u2019t report the clinical outcomes of ECMO use except for two studies. In the retrospective study conducted by Yang et al., 52 critically ill adult patients were identified with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU), among them, 31 patients had died at 28 days. 6 patients were received ECMO, and 5 of them died and 1 patient was still on ECMO at the endpoint (Yang et al., 2020). Another retrospective study implemented by Guqin et al. included 221 patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 48 of severe patients developed ARDS, and 10 of them received invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and ECMO support. 2 patients had clinical benefits and had been discharged and 3 of them were non-survivors. The rest 5 patients were still on ECMO at the endpoint (Guqin et al., 2020) (Table 2\n). Given lacking of clinical trial of ECMO on COVID-19, we could not conclude whether SARS-CoV-2-infected patients have benefited from ECMO at this time. But our concern may be settled by the ongoing trials in China (ChiCTR2000030744 and ChiCTR2000029804).",

Alternatively, after lung protective ventilation (tidal volume 6 ml/kg, PEEP\u226510cmH2O) was adopted and combined with lung recruitment maneuver, prone position ventilation, and high-frequency oscillation ventilation, patients are still under the condition of pure oxygen inhalation, in these situations, ECMO should be considered for ARDS as rescue therapy when meeting one of the following criteria: (1) PaO2/FiO2<100 mmHg; (2) P(A-a)O2>600 mmHg; (3) pH < 7.2 and plateau pressure >30cmH2O with respiratory rate more than 35 breaths per minute; (4) Age<65 years old; (5) Mechanical ventilation<7d; (6) Absence of contraindications (Critical Care Medicine Committee of the Chinese Association of Chest Physicians, 2019). Besides, for the patients with a harmful potential of ventilator-induced lung injury, lower ventilation and volumes and pressures may lead to hypercapnic acidosis, in this situation, extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO2R) can be an important tool by providing direct removal of CO2 from blood (Brodie et al., 2019).",

Early evaluation, rapid assembly, and cannulation timely are important. Regardless of the efficacy of ECMO, under the special situation of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, we should also pay more attention to the safety of medical staff since they get infected easily when manipulating ECMO. Some approaches, such as intubation, ventilator venting, and sputum suction pose a high risk of infection to medical staff. Therefore, all related staff should be supplied with sufficient protection and be restricted in the independent area. As the pandemic spread, a shortage of ECMO consoles may be another problem to be solved due to a surge of critically ill patients worldwide. Furthermore, trained staff and isolation rooms should be in full preparedness to meet the coming challenges.",
