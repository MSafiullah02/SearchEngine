Easy to implement, predictive multiscale modeling frameworks to integrate the wide variety of clinical and research datasets into actionable insights, which could inform therapeutic regime strategies are lacking. We present a multiscale, multicellular, spatiotemporal model of the infection of epithelial tissue by a generic virus, a simplified cellular immune response and viral and immune-induced tissue damage. Our initial model is built of modular components to allow it to be easily extended and adapted in a collaborative fashion to describe specific viral infections, tissue types and immune responses. The model allows us to define three parameter regimes: where viral infection coincides with a massive cytopathic effect, where the immune system rapidly controls the virus and where the immune system controls the virus but extensive tissue damage occurs. We use the model in a proof-of-concept application to evaluate a number of drug therapy concepts. Inhibition of viral internalization and faster immune-cell recruitment lead to containment of infection. Fast viral internalization and slower immune response lead to uncontrolled spread of infection. Simulation of a drug, whose mode of action is to reduce production of viral RNAs, shows that a relatively limited reduction of viral replication at the beginning of infection greatly decreases the total area of tissue damage and maximal viral load, while even a treatment that greatly reduces the rate of genomic replication rapidly loses efficacy as the infection progresses. A number of simulation conditions lead to stochastically variable outcomes, with some replicas clearing or controlling the virus, while others see virus-induced damage sweep the simulated lung patch. The model is open-source and modular, allowing rapid development and extension of its components by groups working in parallel.",

            "text": "Emerging outbreaks of infectious disease require the ability to rapidly identify the mechanisms of disease initiation and progression and critical factors to prevent, contain and therapeutically treat infected individuals. The current global outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2), the causative agent of COVID-19, has reinforced the need for integrating and applying the wide variety of data and knowledge available concerning infection by other viruses like influenza with the more limited data specifically for coronavirus like SARS-CoV and MERS and the emerging data on SARS-CoV-2 into actionable insights for understanding disease mechanisms and developing therapies. Some key questions that arise during epidemics or pandemics include: What mechanisms lead a virus to produce different clinical outcomes when infecting a population? What types of underlying health conditions contribute to more severe infections or lead to death? How can virus heterogeneity contribute to these outcomes? When should different types of therapies be administered to an individual to maximize their efficacy and provide the best chance for a complete recovery? Could prophylactic use of a medication be beneficial or is it likely to cause excessive side effects from toxicity? How can medications be combined to increase efficacy and reduce toxicity or to respond to the specific health state of individual patients (personalization) ? We can address these types of questions and related ones using multiscale modeling and simulations to rapidly understand key disease and host response mechanisms, their parameters and how they affect clinical outcomes. Being able to integrate and make connections between biomolecular data, and cellular, tissue, and whole-body scales provides a powerful tool for researchers and clinicians to gain insights and understanding into the origins of different clinical outcomes after infection and to optimize potential treatment regimes.",

            "text": "Viruses have been responsible for many deadly global pandemics including the Spanish [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Each of these viruses shares some common characteristics of infection, replication, disease progression and transmission. Infectious agents enter the body by one of three common routes: respiratory (inhalation or contact with contaminated surfaces and touching eyes, nose or mouth), bloodborne (flea, tick, or mosquito vector borne, breach in skin) or oral-fecal (ingesting) [6] . A hallmark of acute viral infections is rapid onset and short disease duration that can be mild or severe. The time course of disease progression varies with each virus, although the stages include a latency period during which individuals are contagious, but asymptomatic, followed by onset of outward symptoms and finally recovery. The body's earliest, non-specific response to pathogens is through the innate immune response system. This system responds within hours of infection and is triggered upon the detection of viral genome release within the cytoplasm of host cells, or display of foreign viral structural protein fragments or genetic material on the surface of infected host cells known collectively as pathogen associated molecular patterns ( PAMP s) [7] . Phagocytic cells like macrophages and dendritic cells have pattern recognition receptors ( PRR s) on their cell surface that detect the PAMPs on infected cells, Toll-like receptors ( TLR ) are one example of PRRs [8] . Multiple complex signaling pathways are initiated that produce proinflammatory interferon type 1 ( IL1 ), other cytokines and chemokines to stimulate growth and recruitment of immune cells; these molecular signals are associated with early clinical symptoms of viral infection such as fever, fatigue, and cough [9, 10] . Immune cells targeted by early activation of the innate immune response are dendritic cells, macrophages, neutrophils, mast cells, basophils, eosinophils, leukocytes, and natural killer ( NK ) cells [11] . Type 1 interferons stimulate the expression of genes responsible for preventing critical steps in the viral infection process [12] . Macrophages and dendritic cells that have engulfed and degraded viral pathogens travel to nearby lymph nodes and serve as viral antigen presenting cells ( APC s) to naive T-cells thereby activating the pathogen-specific adaptive immune response within days of infection resulting in the production of antibodies and memory B-cell lymphocytes that provide long term immunity [13] .",

The body-wide distribution of the host-cell receptors could contribute to the extent of viral infection and differences in patient outcomes.

Epithelial tissue lines the outer surface of organs and blood vessels throughout the body [20] , as well as the inner surface of cavities in many internal organs including the lungs [11] . Mammalian respiratory passageways from the naval cavity through the bronchi are lined by ciliated, columnar epithelium [11] . While lung alveoli are lined by a thin layer of simple squamous epithelium [21] . In the lung, epithelial cells seperate the airways and potentially harmful materials within them from the bloodstream, while allowing for the free diffusion of carbon dioxide and oxygen [11, 21] . After virus capsid glycoproteins bind to host epithelial cells, via endocytosis, virus particle uncoating and viral genome entry into the host cell occurs [22] [23] [24] . Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 can infect host cells by two different modes of entry 1) binding to the host cell surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), triggering pH-dependent proteolytic activation of S2 domain of spike protein by cathepsin L resulting in endocytosis of the viral particle or by 2) binding to the ACE2 receptor and triggering pH-independent proteolytic activation of the S2 domain of spike protein by the transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2 that often resides near the ACE2 receptor on the host cell surface resulting in host cell-viral membrane fusion [16, [25] [26] [27] .",

SARS-CoV-2 and other enveloped single stranded positive-sense RNA viruses occur within the cytoplasm of host epithelial cells where their genome can be used directly as an mRNA template; in contrast the influenza viruses, are negative ssRNA genomes that must be imported into the host cell nucleus for genome replication [28, 29] . From the positive-sense ssRNA genome, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is first translated into protein and subsequently used to produce a complementary negative strand of RNA that will be used as a template to manufacture many more copies of positive-sense ssRNA genomes and smaller positive strand subgenomic sequences [30] . The copies of positive ssRNA strand genomes will later be packaged into new virions and the subgenomic sequences are translated to produce viral proteins [30] . After replication inside the host, viral positive RNA strands and viral capsid proteins spontaneously assemble to form new virions and are transported to the cell membrane for release into the extracellular environment through the continuous process of viral budding [31] [32] [33] [34] . The yield for newly produced virions is not clearly defined in SARS-CoV-2 as it is with lytic viruses [35] . The main regulation of the viral replication process occurs at the replication stage because the balance between replication and translation must be carefully maintained [32, 33] .",

Here we present our framework for modular multiscale spatiotemporal modeling of viral infection and immune response. In this paper our framework is implemented using CompuCell3D, a user-friendly multiscale modeling program [36] .

We represent the complexity of viral replication by defining four broad stages: unpacking, replication, translation and assembly. The subcellular kinetics of virus replication then determines the release of new viral particles into the extracellular environment that contribute to the further spreading of the virus in host tissue.

            "text": "Cytokines were chosen to represent the larger group of small molecule signals that include chemokines, interferons, and RNAi. We functionally represented the complexity of immune signaling by using a single diffusive cytokine field in the extracellular environment. The cytokine field produces local immune effects such as activation of immune cells by exposure to cytokine for a period of time. The cytokine field also produces long range immune effects by recruiting immune cells to the locale of the simulation through long-distance signaling in the lymphatic system. We represent the transport of cytokines through the lymphatic system and bloodstream by introducing delay to the recruitment of immune cells by cytokine signaling. Cell death also occurs in our model due to two mechanisms associated with host immune response. Immune cells identify infected cells on contact by antigen presentation and induce apoptosis. In sufficiently high cytokine, immune cells indiscriminately kill epithelial cells by secretion of an oxidative agent. Simulations were initialized with a sheet of uninfected epithelial cells, devoid of any diffusive virus, cytokine, and immune cells (active or inactive). Infection began with a single infected epithelial cell at the center point of the epithelial sheet ( Figure 2A ). We established a baseline set of parameters (Table 1 ) from which widespread infection occurs over the course of a simulation from this initial configuration. In simulation of the baseline set of parameters, resident immune cells ( Figure 2B Table 1 . Code to execute this specific simulation for these parameter values in CompuCell3D is available at https://github.com/covid-tissue-models/covid-tissue-response-models/tree/cc3d_first_model_v0_ cand/CC3D/Models/BiocIU/SARSCoV2MultiscaleVTM/interesting-results/Preliminary%20Set%2 01/simimg . By varying the model parameters and comparing the resulting cell count time series we see that there are several critical parameters in the model which control outcomes of the simulation. In Figure 3 we present time series for different values of the virus-receptors association affinity , a parameter that controls the internalization of extracellular viral k on particles into epithelial cells (see Equation (3) in Models and methods ). We see that an increase in decreased virus-receptors association affinity drives the system toward quantitatively distinct simulation outcomes ( Figure 3 ). We compared simulation outcomes using the baseline virus-receptors association affinity value (shown in Figure 2 ) and a 100-fold decrease from the baseline. Decreased virus-receptors association affinity shows a low number of infected and dead cells at the end of the simulation ( Figure 3A , left columns). Increasing virus-receptors association affinity (to the value used in Figure 2 ) results in an increased number of infected cells during the simulation and corresponding increase in the number of final dead cells ( Figure  3A , right columns). Increasing virus-receptors association affinity also results in complete cell death in nine out of ten simulations (749 total number of dead cells for one simulation). Total cell death at the end of simulation time varies for decreased virus-receptors association affinity ( Figure 3B ): ten simulations using the decreased virus-receptors association affinity produced final total numbers of dead cells in the range of 1 and 150 (mean 71.6, standard deviation 53.8 for ten simulations). By performing a multidimensional parameter sweep in Figure 4 we see that variations in immune response delay coefficient (a parameter that controls the responsiveness of \u03b2 delay immune cell recruitment to local diffusive cytokine in the simulation domain, see Equations (12)- (14) in Models and methods .) and virus-receptors association affinity parameters drive the system toward two distinct simulation outcomes: containment and widespread infection (which are denoted as green and orange shaded regions respectively). We generated simulations using baseline values for virus-receptors association affinity and immune response delay coefficient (from Figure 2 ) and compared results with simulations generated using 10-fold and 100-fold increase and decrease from the baseline values (shown in Figure 4 ). These parameter variations produce distinctive qualitative outcomes in the number of dead cells ( Figure 4A ). Baseline values of parameters result in propagation of the infection through the tissue and widespread death of epithelial cells ( Figure 4A , center panel). Increasing virus-receptors association affinity and decreasing immune response delay coefficient drives the system towards widespread infection and cell death with small variability between simulation replicated ( Figure 4A , red shaded panels). In this region, decreasing immune response delay coefficient decreases the rate of cell death as shown by the inflection points on the number of dead cells occurring earlier for smaller values of immune response delay coefficient.",

In these regions, immune response delay coefficient controls the clearance rate of the extracellular virus as shown by the rapid decay with increasing values of immune response delay coefficient. The time scales of viral growth in the extracellular environment is faster than the rate of cell death, as shown by maxima in the extracellular environment occurring before maxima in the number of dead cells. The phase space for key metrics reveals that decreasing viral internalization and increasing immune response consistently drives the system towards containment of the infection ( Figure 5 ). High viral internalization is generally correlated with high number of final dead cells ( Figure 5A ), high number of maximum viruses ( Figure 5B ) and high number of maximum cytokine levels ( Figure 5C ). In general, values for each of these metrics increases proportionally with increased internalization, with the lowest value providing the lower bound and the highest value providing the upper bound. A noticeable exception is the maximum cytokine level, where at least one of the lower viral internalization values (0.1) produces a high number of cytokines ( Figure 5C ).",

Reduction at the 500th simulation step (500/30 hours) produces containment for reduction factors below 0.375.

In this regime,variability between simulation replicates increases with decreasing reduction factor and time delay of application. can also be seen in the total diffusive r max virus in the environment (Figure 7) . For the cases where the infection is contained, viral load peaks either at or shortly after the replication rate reduction event, after which the total virus in the environment decreases (Figure 7 green shaded region). When the replication rate reduction event happens at the beginning of the simulation and the replication rate is sufficiently reduced, very small amounts of viral particles are released to the extracellular environment.

In the baseline simulation cell death occurred far from the initial site of infection by 200 MCSs (200/30 hours), indicating cytotoxic killing by the immune cells (as secondary infection has occurred by this point but not enough time has passed for virally induced apoptosis to occur in the subsequently infected epithelial cells). We also showed that recruitment of immune cells can continue even after most epithelial cells have died. The model makes this possible by representing both a resident immune cell population ( e.g. , 5 or so early immune cells for all parameter sets) and additions to that population due to recruitment by long-distance signaling ( e.g. , large numbers of immune cells seen during widespread infection).",

We also showed that multiple model outcomes can result from the same set of parameters for simulation replicates (with different realizations of the random number sequence), owing to stochasticity of the processes and the ability of even a single infected epithelial cell to (re)ignite the infection cycle ( i.e. , internalization, replication, secretion).

The incorporation of these proof-of-concept modules serves two purposes: to facilitate the integration of previously developed models ( e.g. , viral replication) into a stable, working modeling and simulation environment of spatiotemporal dynamics, and to provide functional outlines for incorporating supportable and improved versions of individual modules. Modules that are readily accessible for improvement include viral internalization, viral replication and immune response.

We are working to implement these nonspatial models of viral infection and immune response, and to replace specific scalar-represented objects in these models ( e.g. , viral production, cytokine secretion or tissue damage) with the appropriate spatial components of our model. By starting with a validated model that uses ordinary differential equations and adding spatial components gradually, we can calibrate our spatial models and validate our results. We can also conduct simultaneous validation by building multiple implementations of the conceptual and quantitative models independently and simultaneously. We are currently performing cross-platform validation of the conceptual model originally presented here (and originally implemented in CompuCell3D) with working implementations in Chaste [59, 60] and Morpheus [61] multicellular modeling platforms. This near-simultaneous model replication and its lessons for model design and implementation will be the subject of a future study.",

Viral replication hijacks some of the host metabolic pathways and is limited by the availability of resources in the host cell. We assume we can model the rate-limiting effect of resource availability as regulation at the replicating step. After replication, newly synthesized viral genetic material is translated into new capsid protein and assembled into new viral particles.

Significant immune cell recruitment was apparent (Figure 2B) between 400 and 800 MSCs (between 400/30 and 800/30 hours): the number of immune cells more than doubled between 200 MCSs (200/30 hours) and 400 MCSs (400/30 hours). However, infection spread uncontrollably before peak recruitment in the baseline simulation. From approximately 400 MCSs (400/30 hours) onward, massive cell death centered around the initial site of infection occurred, and the virus spread outwards. Infection reached the boundary of the simulation domain by 600 MCSs (600/30 hours), indicating total spread of the infection. Immune cells continued to be recruited, even to 800 MCSs (800/30 hours), though few living cells remained. By time 1,000 MCSs (1000/30 hours), all epithelial cells died, and many immune cells exited the simulation. The number of infected cells was maximal at 700 MCSs (700/30 hours), the amount of extracellular virus was maximal at 860 MCSs (860/30 hours). The extracellular cytokine level was maximal at 740 MCSs (740/30 hours). As the number of live cells decreased, the amount of extracellular virus and the amount of extracellular proinflammatory cytokine decreased. The immune recruitment signal peaked at 740 MCSs (740/30 hours), leading to infiltration of immune cells too late to contain the spread of infection (maximal number of immune cells at 870 MCSs, (870/30 hours).
