Eighty percent of this highly marginalized population is concentrated in Bolivia, Guatemala, Mexico and Peru. Health care services for these ethnic groups face distinct challenges in view of their high levels of marginalization and cultural differences from the majority. Drawing on 30 years of work on the responses of health systems in the indigenous communities of Latin America, our group of researchers believes that countries in the region must be prepared to combat the epidemic in indigenous settings marked by deprivation and social disparity. We discuss four main challenges that need to be addressed by governments to guarantee the health and lives of those at the bottom of the social structure: the indigenous peoples in the region. More than an analysis, our work provides a practical guide for designing and implementing a response to COVID-19 in indigenous communities.",

Eighty percent of this highly marginalized population is concentrated in Bolivia, Guatemala, Mexico and Peru. Rural indigenous peoples have historically encountered the steepest barriers to health services and endured profound discrimination based on ethnicity, poverty and language. Severe cases of COVID-19 are expected to sweep through these communities given their precarious health and living conditions. Malnutrition, infectious diseases and chronic illnesses characterize their epidemiological profile and are compounded by high fertility levels. The attack rate of the epidemic in Latin America has been estimated at 0.2%. Of the 84,000 expected patients, approximately 60,000 will seek health care, 8400 will require hospitalization and 3600 will be classified as critical. Governments have focused their responses primarily on urban populations speaking the dominant languages: Spanish and Portuguese. However, they have shown little interest in crafting strategies targeted specifically for the rural and indigenous communities.",
