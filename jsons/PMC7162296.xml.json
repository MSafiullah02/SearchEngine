Although this is true for many pathogens with density\u2010dependent transmission, these well\u2010defined thresholds are often nonexistent for host\u2013parasite systems with more nuanced transmission structures (Getz & Pickering 1983). Complications include free\u2010living parasite stages, endangered hosts sharing parasites with abundant reservoir populations, and systems with frequency\u2010dependent transmission (Lafferty & Gerber 2002; Lafferty et al. 2015). Consequently, managers are tasked with mitigating wildlife disease in systems of varying complexity. Yet, elimination of harmful parasites remains elusive due to logistical challenges of reaching adequate proportions of wildlife, limited monetary and veterinary resources, and insufficient understanding of the numerous drivers underlying host disease state.",

This is particularly important when managing endangered populations threatened by generalist parasites. Under these scenarios, multihost transmission can be the difference between population persistence and local extinction. For example, disease remains a primary threat to endangered Ethiopian wolves (Canis simensis) (Randall et al. 2004; Gordon et al. 2015). Though their population is too small to sustain pathogens such as canine distemper virus and rabies, the large population of dogs nearby is consistently identified as the source of disease outbreaks through viral sequencing.

Avian influenza, for example, undergoes frequent mutation to sequentially infect the host respiratory tract and avoid sites of infection that limit transmission (Reperant et al. 2012). For Mycoplasma gallisepticum, the bacterial pathogen that causes conjunctivitis in House Finches (Haemorhous mexicanus), quantitative genetic tools paired with disease phenotype data suggest rapid evolution of increased transmission potential and virulence upon emergence in a new host population (Hawley et al. 2013).",

This represents a promising direction in chytridiomycosis research because parasite variability has been implicated in driving disease outcomes in hosts. Similar analyses of Plasmodium spp. suggest mechanisms of immune evasion in mosquito vectors (Molina\u2010Cruz et al. 2015) and have identified loci associated with antimalarial drug resistance under positive selection (Shen et al. 2017). Genetic tools have also located hotspots of polygenomic malaria infection, where hosts harbor multiple parasite strains simultaneously (Rice et al. 2016). Considered together, this information enables better monitoring where malaria transmission and polygenomic infection rates are high and suggests possible molecular mechanisms for disease control.",

Host fitness is intimately coupled with these traits and forms a significant component of their underlying mechanistic and molecular processes. In both cases, the prevailing paradigm is based on the assumption that genetic diversity at immune loci buffers hosts from disease risk.

In 1 example, Ellison et al. (2014) compared transcriptome data from 4 sympatric frog species with different Bd susceptibility. When exposed to a pathogenic strain of Bd, resistant species exhibited downregulation of skin inflammatory pathways and upregulation of genes pertaining to skin\u2010barrier integrity and cell\u2010mediated immune responses. These patterns suggests that resistant hosts maintain skin and immune functioning during infection.

            "text": "Perhaps the strongest example of an integrative genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenetic approach to understanding disease pathogenesis occurs at the intersection of cancer and infectious disease with DFTD. Although genomic analyses revealed insights about host diversity and disease transmission, they have not elucidated specific mechanisms underlying emergence and immune evasion of this transmissible cancer. To address these questions, Murchison et al. (2010) considered functional variation alongside traditional genetic markers. Host and parasite genetics confirmed that tumors were genetically distinct from hosts and clonal in origin. Analyses of devil and tumor transcriptomes suggest that DFTD first arose in a mutated Schwann cell. Even though these cells function in local immunity, the Schwann cell origin of DFTD does not sufficiently explain the capacity of tumor cells to evade the immune system. More likely mechanisms appeared in analysis of expression profiles, which revealed upregulation in molecules associated with immune evasion and downregulation in molecules associated with tumor suppression. Considered alongside MHC\u2010based and genomic analyses (Grueber et al. 2015; Morris et al. 2015), it seems that low immunogenetic diversity in hosts decreases the immune system's probability of detecting tumors that fail to display MHC class I molecules on their cell surfaces (Siddle et al. 2007, 2013). This failure appears to result from epigenetic changes that induce downregulation of antigen\u2010processing genes in cancerous cells, which then allows tumor cells to slip under the immune system's radar. Critically, this may be reversible through epigenetic or immunological manipulation, which suggests a promising new direction for treatment (Siddle et al. 2013).",

Recent evidence suggests that epigenetic mechanisms interact with commensal microbial communities inhabiting hosts, thus participating in regulatory cross\u2010talk between the immune system, epigenome, and microbiome (Levy et al. 2015; Celluzzi & Masotti 2016).

Many primarily seek to characterize microbiome structure in healthy individuals. For example, Cheng et al. (2015) sequenced microbial communities from wild and captive Tasmanian devils and noted distinct differences between them. This establishes a baseline for comparison with communities disrupted by captivity and DFTD. In other systems, such as chytridiomycosis, research has moved away from descriptive studies toward manipulative experiments seeking novel treatment options. Many amphibian species naturally harbor skin bacteria known to secrete metabolites harmful to Bd. Commensal microbial communities have therefore been associated with differing disease outcomes in host populations (Jani et al. 2017). In an effort to commandeer this phenomenon for disease management, treatment of Rana muscosa with Bd\u2010resistant bacteria drastically decreased mortality in experimental trials (Harris et al. 2009). Similar results were reported for experimental manipulations of Anaxyrus boreas microbial communities, where the loss of Bd\u2010inhibitory bacteria increased infection rates and the application of resistant bacteria increased survival (Kueneman et al. 2016). However, probiotic bioaugmentation may not be universally applicable as frog species harbor unique communities that differ in response to manipulation (Kueneman et al. 2014; K\u00fcng et al. 2014).

            "text": "When multiple questions arise and resources allow, applying an integrative molecular approach represents an exciting new frontier in wildlife disease ecology. Concurrent examination of interconnected factors within molecular diversity can elucidate patterns and processes relevant to complex wildlife disease systems. As evidenced in case studies of DFTD and chytriodiomycosis, analysis of genetic, gene regulatory, and microbial variation provides important insight into pathology, transmission dynamics, and novel avenues of treatment. For DFTD, genetic and transcriptomic analyses were needed to distinguish host from parasite, confirm allograft transmission and Schwann cell origin of the disease, and discover means of immune evasion through suppression of immune signaling amid minimal immunogenetic diversity in hosts. These insights have since informed management strategies, including ongoing treatment development and management of captive insurance populations (Pye et al. 2016). In the case of chytriodiomycosis, genetic and transcriptomic analyses have furthered understanding of immune processes involved in species\u2010specific resistance to fungal infection, and microbial analyses have provided promising new treatment options through bioaugmentation with naturally Bd\u2010resistant microbes (Bletz et al. 2013; Woodhams et al. 2016).",

            "text": "Overall, application of molecular methods will enable more effective monitoring and management of at\u2010risk populations. Depending on questions and data types examined (Fig. 2), understanding of wildlife disease prevalence, pathology, and persistence can be improved. Parasite genetics can refine diagnostic techniques, reconstruct transmission pathways, and identify genes underlying virulence. Similar analyses in hosts can characterize host population structure, patterns of immunogenetic diversity, and specific genes associated with resistance and tolerance strategies. Further examination of gene regulatory diversity can identify specific mechanisms underlying successful parasite invasion and host morbidity that may serve as targets for epigenetic intervention. Finally, commensal microbial analyses can elucidate patterns of dysbiosis associated with host disease state and suggest probiotic bioaugmentation as a novel treatment strategy. Especially when considered alongside other drivers of disease state (Fig. 1), molecular analyses present innumerable opportunities to advance management of wildlife disease and mitigate threats posed to human and domestic animal health, agricultural systems, and wildlife populations. From examination of the human literature, it is evident that the technology for molecular analyses exists. The urgency of many conservation problems suggests that it is time these methods are applied to studies of wildlife disease.",
