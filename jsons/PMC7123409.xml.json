It comprises initiatives in five main areas:Expanding the coverage and benefit of health insurance schemes in urban and rural areasEstablishing a national essential medicines scheme to ensure the availability of affordable medicines and reduce the ability of health providers to profit from the sale of drugsImproving basic service availability and quality while also reducing referrals to specialist care and hospitalsEnsuring the availability of basic public health services for all populationsPiloting public hospital reform, particularly in order to separate hospital management and clinical service provision",

The Reform is planned to continue to 2020, with gradual achievement of its overarching objectives on universal and equitable access to health services; the second phase (2012\u20132015) was announced in early 2012 (Ministry of Health 2012a), and a major additional pronouncement on county hospital reform was made in early 2014 (State Council 2014). Monitoring and evaluation of the Reform is slated to prioritize its different hierarchical elements (Figs. 2 and 3), although detailed plans for such evaluation have not been released.",

It again commits to expanding insurance benefits and introduces priority to unifying China\u2019s several health insurance schemes; it encourages development of commercial insurance and the introduction of capitation and other payment reforms to separate doctors from the financial management of hospitals; it suggests that the private sector should manage 20% of health services by 2015; family general practice is promoted alongside expanding community and public health services, and the drug production, prescription, and pricing will be further consolidated and regulated; performance-based funding of health staff is also mentioned.

This vagueness hints at a major problem for China\u2019s health sector, the reliance on local government support for the national equity objective (Hipgrave et al. 2012). Another major problem remains the difficulty of reforming hospital management, effectively undoing the private, for-profit system that evolved over recent decades. As a result, China\u2019s HSR has not yet reduced the proportional financial burden of healthcare on households or their risk of catastrophic expenditure on health (Meng et al. 2012).",

In the past, when the health sector was of low priority, this severely limited the implementation of national laws relevant to the health sector. For example, the 1989 Law on Control of Infectious Diseases conferred on local government\u2019s responsibility for various forms of reporting and action, but was weakly implemented, culminating in the wake-up call of SARS in 2003, redrafting of the law and major reform of CDC (Hipgrave 2011a; Wang et al. 2008a). Initiatives depending on countrywide uptake such as the 2010 national measles vaccination campaign still rely heavily on local funding and prioritization; recent environmental degradation and food and drug safety scandals are further evidence of the lack of cross-sectoral priority given to the health sector in China. The partial rollback of the one-child policy announced at national level in 2013 remains subject to interpretation and optional implementation by provincial governments. Despite its evident high priority (Tang et al. 2014a), many aspects of the HSR itself are dependent on the same support and follow-up by provincial and even county governments (Hipgrave et al. 2012; Brixi et al. 2012).",

In some provinces, a few key HSR targets such as health insurance coverage were incorporated into subnational officials\u2019 performance evaluation criteria, which has been effective in ensuring progress. However, in other, more complicated reform areas, such as strengthening primary healthcare, public hospital reforms, and others, ensuring progress has been more difficult. Indeed, the reform of public hospitals suffers from a lack of consensus or clear national guidance on direction, limiting its prioritization and implementation outside pilot areas, particularly at low levels.",

While there are promising moves to make local government generally more accountable to the public (such as measurement of \u201cgreen gross domestic product (GDP)\u201d and independent surveys of public opinion on local government performance in some provinces), the main motivation for subnational authorities remains economic development and revenue generation (Zhou 2010b). Moreover, while banking, communications, etc. are carefully regulated and monitored from above, like most social sectors, health services are largely organized and monitored at the local level. It is too costly for China\u2019s undermanned central government to independently monitor and evaluate subnational health performance (Wong 2010; Zhou 2010b). These circumstances explain the limited ability of national health officials to ensure the HSR is fully pursued at grassroots level.",

However, many Congress members are unelected (in the western democratic sense) appointees, and the People\u2019s Congress generally rubber-stamps the documents presented. However, with the increasing attention of the Party and government in China to public comment through social media, albeit increasingly censored (Osnos 2014), and local protests, there is growing acknowledgment of their answerability to the general public. Therefore, while during local planning there is almost no formal process for the public to make input, there are opportunities for the general population to voice concerns through the courts, social media, petitions, protests, etc., especially when issues affect a significant proportion of a community. Although the process is usually slow (the HSR took many years to be formalized (Tang et al. 2014a)), there is usually gradual recognition and acknowledgment of the need to act. On the other hand, implementation of plans usually requires higher-level pressure on the various lower tiers of government, and this pressure progressively dissipates further down the hierarchy; it may be ignored for issues that don\u2019t have high-level and cross-sectoral support and the support of local government. Hence, targets for insurance coverage and drug price control are accepted, but controlling the environmental impact of local industry is often ignored (Human Rights Watch 2011). In this process, public influence is rather indirect and can be ignored if local economic, political, or vested interests override it.",

There is no ombudsman or independent regulator in China\u2019s health system, and senior appointments are normally approved by the ruling Party organization. However, since launching the HSR, government is learning that empowering patients and regularly collecting their feedback on key parameters such as service prices and quality strengthens accountability across the government levels and can help achieve the overall goals of the reform (State Council 2014). Patient satisfaction and feedback is increasingly incorporated into the performance evaluation framework for HSR implementation (Ma 2013).

China does not have a tradition of locally representative, population-based surveys on health outcomes; those which are undertaken are almost never independent. The disaggregated impact of health initiatives and local health status remains unknown except at crude (regional and urban-rural) levels (Meng et al. 2012; Ministry of Health Centre for Health Statistics and Information 2009). This lack of data reduces the ability of governments to allocate resources according to local demography and disease epidemiology (which are changing rapidly with urbanization). In this context, quality implementation of new HMIS initiatives (Hipgrave 2011b) will be critical; however, again these are national initiatives reliant on local funding. The HMIS is mentioned as a priority for the second phase of the HSR (Ministry of Health 2012a), but in general the monitoring and evaluation of China\u2019s health sector remains weak and non-independent and is not prioritized at subnational level.",

For example, the number of hospital beds per 1000 population in 2011 was around 4, among the lowest in the world (Ministry of Health 2012b). Health infrastructure in China also suffered from a major urban-rural divide in the earlier stages of social and economic development. Not only did urban health infrastructure enjoy greater public financial support, it attracted loans and other financial instruments because it was profitable and boosted the local economy. For many years, rural facilities received very limited government subsidy and relied on collective funding among farmers. Rural health infrastructure lagged seriously, in terms of both the basic condition of health facilities (buildings, beds, etc.) and the equipment, while big urban hospitals acquired technical equipment of high quality. In 2005, there were 3.6 hospital beds per 1000 urban residents, but only 0.78 in rural townships (Ministry of Health 2007). This inequity was recognized by national government, and in 2006 the majority of a national bond issue was used to finance a project earmarked for rural health, specifically to finance the rebuilding, renovation, and updating of medical equipment for rural providers, including primary health facilities such as CDC and MCH institutions. The NDRC and its local branches approved the funding proposals for physical health infrastructure. More recently, the 2009 HSR allocated large sums to further improve physical health sector infrastructure (focusing on rural remote rural areas, but also urban community health centers). Progress on this aspect of the Reform has been very positive (Yip et al. 2012).",

As a result, doctors worked where they could be assured of income, patients became disillusioned with the care at rural clinics, self-referral to urban clinics increased, and the distribution of doctors, nurses, and health facilities was heavily biased to urban areas (Yip et al. 2012; UNDP China and China Institute for Reform and Development 2008; Youlong et al. 1997; Anand et al. 2008) (Table 2). Residents of urban areas in China, particularly in the large eastern cities, enjoy physical access to health services to the same level as in most developed nations. However, like many other Asian nations, China has trained more doctors than nurses or midwives, and there are progressively fewer staff with formal health training in progressively poorer rural areas (Youlong et al. 1997; Anand et al. 2008) (Table 3). China includes TCM practitioners (13%) in headcounts of health staff (Anand et al. 2008).",

One of the main objectives of China\u2019s HSR is to regulate the remuneration of doctors and to separate their income from choices on clinical care. However, while China has reduced the level of out-of-pocket expenditure on health to around 35% through increases in public funding and insurance initiatives (Yip et al. 2012), household health expenditure has not decreased either numerically or as a proportion of total household expenditure (Meng et al. 2012). Although there is indirect evidence of increased non-health expenditure by insured households in comparison to before the schemes were introduced (Bai and Wu 2014), this objective of the HSR is proving to be the most difficult to achieve. China\u2019s THE is increasing at around 17% per year, and a large proportion of the increase is due to payment of health facilities, doctors, and other providers by individuals or insurers. As patient expectations rise but out-of-pocket expenses remain numerically high, an increasing number of assaults of doctors by patients\u2019 families are being reported.",

Public health authorities were left to raise their own income through charging fees for services, including vaccination (for which fees were only completely dropped in 2007) and various inspections and screening. Community approaches to disease control were abandoned in favor of vertical programs reliant on national or external funding, and disease surveillance was poor.",

At village or neighborhood level, public or (mostly) private facilities provide basic outpatient care, usually with an attached dispensary and possibly with links to a laboratory or radiology service.

As a result, hospitals in China tend to provide care for all level of illness, resulting in inefficiency and overcrowding. Expenditure on hospital-based care as a proportion of THE in China far exceeds that in many OECD nations (Barber et al. 2014), resulting in the high priority given to improving primary care, community general practice, and lower-level facilities in the HSR (Yip et al. 2012; Ministry of Health 2012a) and to moving outpatient care in particular from hospitals to primary care facilities (Barber et al. 2014).",

The Scheme covers drug production, pricing, distribution, procurement, prescribing, and payment (Hu 2010) and a new National Essential Drugs List (NEDL) for primary healthcare institutions. The 2012 NEDL comprises 317 western drugs and 203 TCM commodities (increased from 205 western and 102 in 2009) for storage and use by grassroots facilities. Bidding prices for 296 NEDL drugs were capped (Schatz and Nowlin 2010), and a \u201czero markup\u201d (no profit) policy was introduced, although markups remain allowed at county-level and higher facilities. By late January 2012, 99.8% of township hospitals and 58.1% of village clinics had implemented the policy (Ministry of Health 2012d). In addition, most (urban) districts and (rural) counties had made NEDL medicines reimbursable by the various health insurance schemes, with higher reimbursement rates than for nonessential medicines (Ministry of Health 2011c). Finally, to regulate the pharmaceutical market and distribution of essential drugs, the NEMS introduced province-wise, collective, internet-based public bidding and procurement for NEDL medicines.",

However, the official HSR documents encourage local adaptation of the broad design (Ho 2010), including the NEDL (which has indeed been widely augmented (Guan et al. 2011; Shi et al. 2011)) and strategies to compensate providers for the zero markup policy. Few evaluations of the impact of the Scheme have emerged. Very early indications suggested little change in prescribing practices (Yip et al. 2012), but a small field evaluation found that while drug procurement has been systematized and the cost of care had declined coincident with reduced drug prices, manufacturers have not uniformly supported the changes, and some drug prices have actually increased. Provider compensation for reduced income was mostly ineffective, forcing some to seek alternative sources of income within and outside the health sector. Rational drug prescribing had improved in this study. The loss of drug income had forced health facilities to rely more on public financing, and providers complained of higher workload and lower incomes (Yang et al. 2013a). Similar issues were found in another study in different locations (Xiao et al. 2013).",

Reports indicated that private health providers can offer services at a cheaper price and shorter physical distance and waiting time for patients (Deng et al. 2013) and are highly active in the provision of healthcare in China. However, most private facilities are small and poorly equipped, and collectively they only employed 17.5% of the total labor force, owned 9.7% of total medical beds, and received 9.1% of total patient hospital visits (Ministry of Health 2012b).

This accounts for common challenges in the private sector, i.e., lack of technical capacity, poor infrastructure, and thus compromised service quality.

            "text": "While China\u2019s progress on major health indicators during the 30 years immediately following the foundation of the PRC is unparalleled (Jamison et al. 1984), marketization and the unaffordability of healthcare for a large proportion of the population stymied progress in the 1980s and 1990s. There are even suggestions that child mortality rates in China actually rose in the 1980s (Banister and Hill 2000), with the breakup of the commune-based health cooperatives. Moreover, improvement in certain indicators has been slow. For example, urban maternal mortality has been slow to fall, almost certainly because reductions in maternity risk for urban residents have been diluted by the much higher risk of death in pregnancy among urban migrants (Fig. 12) (Zhang et al. 2014). Geographic disparities also remain great, particularly between eastern and western provinces (Wang et al. 2012). In general, the priority given to China\u2019s recent HSR acknowledges that progress in its population\u2019s health status was less than could have occurred, given the nation\u2019s economic growth since the 1980s (Yip et al. 2012). Acknowledgement of this is the government target of a one-year increase in life expectancy by 2015 (Ministry of Health 2012a). The most comprehensive analysis of the causes of death and disability in China, published in mid-2013, highlighted the dramatic evolution of its demographic transition, with NCDs now making up all but two of the top 30 causes of lost life years, and most infectious diseases having fallen precipitously. The report also noted the contribution of air and household pollution to mortality and morbidity and the need for cross-sectoral action to tackle the major causes of ill-health in China (Yang et al. 2013b).",

These figures compare favorably with other developing countries, and China\u2019s performance in reducing rural maternal and neonatal mortality has been outstanding (Feng et al. 2010b, 2011). China has already achieved all the health targets in MDGs 4, 5, and 6 and achieved the target on reducing child underweight in the early 2000s. Urban-rural disparity in under-five and particularly maternal mortality has declined since 1990, but remains high for child underweight and stunting and especially for child micronutrient deficiency (UNICEF China, unpublished data; (Hipgrave et al. 2014)).",
