An increased risk of VTE has recently been suggested in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with COVID-19 infection despite adequate thromboprophylaxis [5]. Whether incidence of VTE is higher in patients with COVID-19 is still an issue of debate, and some authors are suggesting increased doses of thromboprophylaxis in these patients.",

Quantitative variables are presented by the mean and the standard deviation (SD) in case they have a normal distribution, or median and the interquartile range (IQR) if they have a non-normal distribution. The association between qualitative variables was studied with Chi-squared Test and Fisher's Exact. For numerical variables, the t-test or the Mann-Whitney U test was used, depending on the normality of the variable. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was generated to determine the accuracy and optimal threshold of D-dimer for DVT diagnosis. Several cutoff points of the D-dimer were chosen arbitrarily by the researchers from different coordinates of the ROC curve to know the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of these cut points. In this sense, a cutoff point with higher sensitivity, another with more specificity and another intermediate were obtained. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis were used for predicting the risk of DVT based on the D-dimer levels (estimation of the odds ratio [OR]) and to determine the independence from other factors includings age, presence of active cancer, sex and body mass index. A logarithmic transformation of the variables that did not present a normal distribution was made prior to their inclusion in the logistic regression model. A comparison of the predicted and observed rate of DVT was performed using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test. A two-tailed p-value < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant for all analyses. IBM SPSS Statistics for Mac, Version 26. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp. was used for all calculations.",

This patient was diagnosed with proximal DVT and thus excluded of the study. Thus, the study comprised 156 patients. All but three patients received standard doses of thromboprophylaxis. These three patients had high bleeding risk, and they received intermittent pneumatic compression. Mean age of the sample was 68.1 (SD 14.5) and 65.4% were male. Median days of hospitalization until CCUS was 9 (IQR 5\u201317). The baseline characteristics of the sample are summarized in Table 1\n.

The study did not provide data about the use of thromboprophylaxis or the VTE events [10]. In a retrospective study, the incidence of VTE was 25% among 81 patients with severe COVID-19 admitted to ICU. Of note, none of the patients had received thromboprophylaxis [11]. A multicenter study of 184 patients with severe COVID-19 from the Netherlands reported 28 (15.2%) episodes of VTE, estimating a VTE cumulative incidence of 27% (95% CI 17\u201337%). All patients received thromboprophylaxis [5]. Another study reported a high incidence of symptomatic VTE in ICU patients (28%), while it was lower in ward patients (3.3%) [9].

These hemostatic changes, together with the higher rate of mortality associated with them, indicate some form of coagulopathy that may predispose to thrombotic events, although the cause is uncertain [6]. D-dimer can be elevated in various conditions, such as pregnancy, postoperative state, malignancy, and sepsis, which lowers its specificity [17]. In combination with a low pretest probability for VTE, a normal D-dimer has been shown to rule out VTE due to its high sensitivity (80%\u2013100%) and NPV up to 100% [18].",

Thus, the index of suspicion for VTE should be high in the case typical DVT symptoms, hypoxemia disproportionate to known respiratory pathologies, or acute unexplained right ventricular dysfunction [6]. Validated diagnostic algorithms in patients with suspected PE, like the YEARS clinical decision rule, incorporate different D-dimer cutoff values at presentation to increase the specificity when compared to the fixed threshold of 500 ng/mL (van der Hulle). In this respect, a recent prospective study showed that a combination of a low clinical pretest probability and a d-dimer level < 1000 ng/mL in outpatients allows to rule out PE (Kearon C). Only one previous study has retrospectively assessed the role of D-dimer for the diagnosis of VTE in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. A single center study from China included 81 critically ill patients and suggested that D-dimer levels > 1500 ng/mL had a sensitivity of 85.0%, a specificity of 88.5% and a NPV of 94.7% for detecting VTE events. However, the study was limited by small sample size and lack of validation [8]. Therefore, we prospectively searched for the optimal D-dimer cutoff point to exclude DVT, resulting in 1570 ng/mL with a NPV of 97.5%, similar results to the previously reported.",
