            "text": "Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is present in the US and other countries worldwide [1]. BVDV are classified as biotypes based on presence or absence of visible cytopathic effects in infected cell cultures: cytopathic (CP) or noncytopathic (NCP) [1]. There are also genotypic and antigenic differences which separate the BVDV into types 1 and 2 with further differentiation into subtypes 1a and 1b [2], [3], [4]. BVDV is responsible for numerous clinical syndromes, including acute infections, as well as conditions associated with immunosuppressive effects of the viral infection [1]. Fetal infections may occur when the susceptible cows/heifers develop a viremia after the initial acute infection. There are several outcomes of the fetal infections depending on gestational stages when the fetus is exposed. In utero infections of bovine fetuses with NCP BVDV between Days 42 and 125 may cause persistent infections (PI) of the fetus which then remain immunotolerant to the infecting BVDV [5]. The fetuses are carried to term, remain seronegative to the infecting virus, and shed the BVDV throughout their lifetime. The PI calves are considered a principal reservoir to expose susceptible cattle [1].",

The present study is unique in that these above cited studies were performed without the BVDV strain of the PI calves identified as to type/subtype. The studies using genetic differences detected by PCR and sequencing were not reported until the 1990s [2], [3], [4]. McClurkin et al. [5] reported that the 7443, NY-1, VM, and MC strains induced PI calves in susceptible fetuses. The subtypes for each of the strains were later subtyped as: 7443, BVDV1b; NY-1, BVDV1b; and VM, BVDV1a. The BVDV subtype for MC the strain is not known. PI calves in that study developed antibodies to other viral and bacterial agents. In that study [5], four PI bulls exposed to BHV-1 and PI-3V developed neutralizing antibodies to each virus ranging from <1:4 to >1:128. None of six PI bulls injected intravenously with their homologous BVDV developed BVDV antibodies. Bolin et al. [20] vaccinated two-year-old steers PI with the BVDV Nebraska strain (later to be determined as 1b), with each of three vaccines: MLV BVDV CP NADL (later to be determined as 1a); MLV BVDV CP Singer (later to be determined as 1a); and a killed vaccine with BVDV Singer. No clinical signs of MD were observed after six weeks of vaccination. However, MD developed when the PI calves were exposed to a CP BVDV strain, TGAC (later to be determined as 1b). Most serums collected at necropsy from the nine PI animals indicated that the PI animals remained seronegative to the PI strain, Nebraska BVDV (later to be determined as 1b). There were calves with titers to the 7443 strain, BVDV (later to be determined as 1a), and calves with titers to the Singer strain, BVDV (later to be determined as 1a). In another study Bolin [21] reported that three cows PI with the Nebraska BVDV (later to be determined as 1b) strain were vaccinated with MLV vaccine containing CP BVDV NADL strain (later to be determined as 1a). The samples collected three weeks postvaccination from the PI animals had antibody titers to BVDV 5960 strain (later to be determined as 1a) and BVDV Singer strain (later to be determined as 1a). The PI BVDV1b calves remained seronegative to the Nebraska, NY-1, and TGAN (later to be determined as 1b). The studies [5], [20], [21] were performed without knowledge of the BVDV/subtype status for any of the strains: the PI, vaccine, or challenge strains. Current knowledge of the various BVDV subtypes allows interpretation of the results of these prior studies [5], [20], [21] particularly relating to serum antibody response to heterologous BVDV strains in PI animals.",

The BVDV isolates were subsequently found to be BVDV2 based on PCR. These calves were later found to have been vaccinated with a MLV vaccine containing BVDV1a NADL strain [24]. In another study, a PI calf with the BVDV1b strain developed BVDV1a serum antibodies to the Singer strain following vaccination with MLV BVDV1a Singer vaccine [25].

            "text": "Bovine respiratory diseases (BRD) including \u201cShipping Fever\u201d are bacterial pneumonias caused by M. haemolytica, P. multocida, and occasionally by Haemophilus somnus. These bacterial pneumonias are associated with stress and may often be predisposed by viruses such as BHV-1, BVDV1a, BVDV1b, BVDV2, PI-3V, BRSV, bovine coronaviruses, and bovine adenoviruses [12], [17]. The PI BVDV animals shedding virus may render the contact cattle more susceptible to bacterial infections [12] as BVDV is immunosuppressive with reduced lymphocyte, neutrophil, and macrophage functions [1]. Pneumonia may also be found in PI BVDV calves at necropsy [23], [26]. In a study of PI calves from a single herd moved to a feedlot and observed over time, 25% of the PI calves had gross pneumonic lesions at necropsy, with no or only mild MD lesions [23]. McClurkin et al. [5] also reported that when PI calves were exposed to M. haemolytica by aerosol, one of four calves died of acute pasteurellosis within three days, and the other three calves became febrile with eventual recovery and increasing M. haemolytica antibody titers. The reduced immune response to the M. haemolytica immunogens in this study suggest that the PI calf may be more susceptible to virulent M. haemolytica or other bacterial respiratory pathogens.",
