            "text": "Cryptococcosis is an infectious disease with a wide range of clinical presentations caused by pathogenic encapsulated yeasts in the genus Cryptococcus. Currently, there are two species of these fungi that commonly cause disease in humans: Cryptococcus neoformans, which causes cryptococcosis in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised hosts, and Cryptococcus gattii, which is primarily a pathogen in apparently immunocompetent patients but can also cause disease in the immunocompromised. C. neoformans was first identified as a human pathogen in 1894 by two German physicians, Otto Busse and Abraham Buschke, when they described a circular yeast-like microorganism in a lesion on the tibia of a woman; the microorganism was initially named Saccharomyces hominis [1]. The name C. neoformans has been consistently adopted in both the mycology and medical literature since 1950 [2]. In the mid-1970s, when Kwon-Chung discovered two mating types of C. neoformans that produced fertile basidiospores, the organisms were subsequently separated into two varieties, var. neoformans (serotypes A and D) and var. gattii (serotypes B and C). These two varieties were recently separated into two species, C. neoformans and C. gattii, based on their genetic background and phylogenetic diversity, as proposed by Kwon-Chung in 2002 [3]. It is possible, as more molecular information is gathered from genome sequencing, that C. neoformans var. neoformans (serotype D) and C. neoformans var. grubii (serotype A) will be divided into separate species as well as other cryptic species.",

Early case reports of cryptococcal infections were primarily associated with cancer, autoimmune diseases, organ transplantation, and receipt of corticosteroids as these immunocompromised populations expanded [4]. A major surge in new cases of cryptococcosis occurred during the first two decades of the HIV pandemic, when cryptococcal infection was an important opportunistic infection (OI) in all parts of the world. Furthermore, around 2000, C. gattii strains (previously geographically restricted to tropical and subtropical regions) caused a localized outbreak of cryptococcosis in apparently immunocompetent individuals on Vancouver Island [5]. This has increased recognition that these fungi can exploit new geographical environments and cause disease in both immunocompromised and apparently immunocompetent hosts. Despite the development of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), which has decreased the rate of HIV-related cryptococcosis in developed countries, the burden of cryptococcal infection is still very high in developing countries and in those individuals without access to health care. It has been estimated that there are a million cases per year with more than 600,000 deaths due to cryptococcosis worldwide [6].",

Both cryptococcal species will grow readily on most fungal culture media without cycloheximide at 30\u201337 \u00b0C in aerobic conditions. However, C. neoformans is generally more thermotolerant than C. gattii, and, within this species, serotype A is generally more tolerant than serotype D strains. In addition to their ability to grow at 37 \u00b0C, the yeast produce a thick shedding polysaccharide capsule, melanin pigments, and the enzymes urease and phospholipase, which allow Cryptococcus to be readily identified from other yeasts. These are also considered to be yeast virulence factors.",

Beginning in the early 1980s, the incidence of cryptococcosis increased significantly and between 6 and 10 % of persons with AIDS developed cryptococcosis [7, 8]. In fact, HIV/AIDS was found to be associated with 80 % of cryptococcosis cases worldwide. Cryptococcal infection is a major OI in HIV-infected patients as the CD4+ cell count falls below 100 cells/\u00b5l. Following widespread implementation of HAART, the incidence of cryptococcosis among patients with HIV/AIDS has fallen significantly in most developed nations. The incidence of cryptococcal infection in persons not infected with HIV has remained stable during this time. Moreover, in developing nations with limited access to HAART, the prevalence of and morbidity and mortality associated with cryptococcosis remains unacceptably high, accounting for up to 600,000 deaths per year. Besides HIV infection, other risk factors for acquiring cryptococcal infections include many conditions that result in an immunocompromised status (Table 15.2). Although both C. neoformans and C. gattii can cause cryptococcosis in apparently normal hosts, the percentage of C. gattii infections causing disease in such patients is significantly higher than for C. neoformans.\n",

Recently, there has been a strong link between the C. gattii outbreak in humans on Vancouver Island and common environmental yeast exposures.

Direct inoculation into tissue due to trauma can be a portal of entry in occasional cases and, potentially, yeast may enter through the gastrointestinal tract. After the yeasts are inhaled into the lungs of a susceptible host, they encounter alveolar macrophages, and other inflammatory cells are recruited through release of cytokines and chemokines such as interleukin (IL)-12, IL-18, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1\u03b1. Cryptococcal infection primarily involves granulomatous inflammation, which is a result of a helper T cell (Th1) response with cytokines including tumor necrosis factor, interferon-\u03b3, and IL-2 [12]. In many circumstances, the yeasts remain dormant (yet viable) in hilar lymph nodes or pulmonary foci of an asymptomatic individual for years and then disseminate outside those complexes when local immunity is suppressed, similar to that which is observed in cases of reactivation tuberculosis or histoplasmosis [10]. In a patient with severely compromised cellular immunity, the yeasts reactivate and proliferate at the site of infection and then disseminate to other sites causing progressive clinical symptoms.",

The three classical virulence factors of C. neoformans include: capsule formation, melanin pigment production, and the ability to grow well at 37 \u00b0C [9, 12]. The prominent antiphagocytic polysaccharide capsule, which is composed of glucuronoxylomannan (GXM), is unique to Cryptococcus species and is considered an essential virulence factor that has multiple effects on host immunity. In addition, C. neoformans possesses an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of diphenolic compounds to form melanin, which may have a biological role to protect the yeasts from host oxidative stresses and which may partially explain the organism\u2019s neurotropism. Finally, its ability to grow at 37 \u00b0C is a basic part of the virulence composite for most of the human pathogenic fungi including Cryptococcus, as molecular studies have linked high-temperature growth with certain signaling pathways and enzymes that this yeast has acquired or adapted over time in order to enhance its pathogenicity.

In a normal host with cryptococcal infection, asymptomatic pulmonary cryptococcosis can occur in about one third of patients with pulmonary infection and patients may present to care with only an abnormal chest radiograph. The most common radiologic findings of cryptococcosis include well-defined single or multiple noncalcified nodules (Fig. 15.1) and pulmonary infiltrates (Fig. 15.2), but other less frequent radiographic findings include pleural effusions, hilar lymphadenopathy, and lung cavitation. Patients with pulmonary cryptococcosis can present with symptoms of acute onset of fever, productive cough, respiratory distress, chest pain, and weight loss [14]. The outbreak of C. gattii infections in Vancouver Island included several cases of severe symptomatic pulmonary cryptococcosis in apparently immunocompetent individuals. In an immunocompromised patient, especially those with HIV infection, cryptococcal pneumonia is usually symptomatic and can progress rapidly to ARDS, even in the absence of CNS involvement. Most immunocompromised patients with cryptococcal infection, however, present with CNS rather than pulmonary symptoms. In fact, more than 90 % of HIV/AIDS patients with cryptococcal infection already have CNS cryptococcosis at the time of diagnosis, many of whom will have a paucity of respiratory complaints. The findings in chest radiographs of immunocompromised patients with pulmonary cryptococcosis are the same as those in immunocompetent patients, but alveolar and interstitial infiltrates tend to be more frequent and imaging can mimic Pneumocystis pneumonia. Accelerated presentations of cryptococcal pneumonia are more common among immunocompromised patients. In pulmonary cryptococcosis, if the infection is confined to the lung, serum cryptococcal polysaccharide antigen is usually negative. However, while a positive serum polysaccharide antigen may indicate the dissemination of the yeast from the lung, it does not confirm CNS involvement. In immunocompromised individuals with pulmonary cryptococcosis, a lumbar puncture to rule out CNS disease should be considered regardless of the patient\u2019s symptoms or serum polysaccharide antigen test results. The only setting in which screening a lumbar puncture may not necessarily need to be performed in a patient with Cryptococcus isolated from the lung is in the asymptomatic, immunocompetent patient with disease that appears to be limited to the lungs.\n\n",

However, on some occasions, patients can present more acutely or lack typical features including headache.

One common skin lesion is a papule or maculopapular rash with central ulceration that may be described as \u201cmolluscum contagiosum-like.\u201d These lesions are indistinguishable from those due to other fungal infections including Histoplasma capsulatum, Coccidioides immitis, and Penicillium marneffei. Other cutaneous lesions of cryptococcosis include acneiform lesions, purpura, vesicles, nodules, abscesses, ulcers (Fig. 15.4), granulomas, pustules, plaques, draining sinus, and cellulitis. Because there are many skin manifestations in cryptococcosis that mimic other infectious as well as malignant conditions, skin biopsy with culture and histopathology are essential for definitive diagnosis. Skin lesions of cryptococcosis usually represent disseminated cryptococcal infection. Primary cutaneous cryptococcosis is very rare and is usually associated with skin injury and direct inoculation of the yeasts. Solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients on tacrolimus seem to be more likely to develop skin, soft-tissue, and osteoarticular infections due to Cryptococcus [15]. Tacrolimus has anti-cryptococcal activity at high temperatures, but loses this activity as environmental temperatures decrease; this may in part explain the increased frequency of cutaneous cryptococcosis in these patients. Despite this series of patients, however, the most common site of disseminated infection in SOT recipients still remains the CNS, including patients receiving tacrolimus.\n",

Furthermore, catastrophic loss of vision without evidence for endophthalmitis has also been reported [20]. Visual loss may be due to one of two pathogenic processes. The first is caused by infiltration of the optic nerve with the yeasts, producing rapid visual loss with few effective treatments. The second is due to increased ICP and compression of the ophthalmic artery. In this setting, patients have slower visual loss and treatment with serial lumbar punctures or ventricular shunts can prevent or slow down visual loss.",

The sensitivity of the India ink preparation technique is 30\u201350 % in non-AIDS-related cryptococcal meningitis and up to 80 % in AIDS-related disease. Some false-positive results can be found from intact lymphocytes, myelin globules, fat droplets, and other tissue cells. Also, dead yeast cells can remain in the CSF and be visualized by India ink preparation for varying periods of time during and after appropriate antifungal treatment.

Several stains can identify the polysaccharide capsular material surrounding the yeasts. These stains can be especially useful in presumptively identifying Cryptococcus when the organism does not grow or cultures are not obtained. They include Mayer\u2019s mucicarmine, periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), and alcian blue stains [2]. The Fontana-Masson stain appears to identify melanin in the yeast cell wall. The fungus is observed as a yeast that reproduces by formation of narrow-based budding with a prominent capsule. Gram stain is not optimal for identification of this yeast, but may show C. neoformans as a poorly stained gram-positive budding yeast (Fig. 15.7) [2]. The recognition of C. neoformans in gram-stained smears of purulent exudates may be hampered by the presence of the large gelatinous capsule that apparently prevents definitive staining of the yeast-like cells.\n\n",

Use of serum cryptococcal antibodies for diagnosis of cryptococcosis has not been adopted. In contrast, detection of cryptococcal capsular polysaccharide antigen in serum or body fluids by a latex agglutination (LA) technique has been robust in its performance and is considered the gold standard diagnostic test for serological diagnosis of cryptococcosis. This test uses latex particles coated with polyclonal cryptococcal capsular antibodies or anti-GXM monoclonal antibodies and has overall sensitivities and specificities of 93\u2013100 % and 93\u201398 %, respectively [28, 29]. The false-positive rate of cryptococcal capsular polysaccharide antigen testing is 0\u20130.4 % [30]. The majority of false-positive results can be explained by technical error (improper boiling/treatment), presence of rheumatoid factor or interference proteins, and infections with Trichosporon beigelii [31] or some bacterial species [32]. However, most of the false-positive results of LA testing for cryptococcal polysaccharide antigen have initial reciprocal titers of 8 or less [28]. Therefore, results of such low titers must be carefully interpreted within the clinical context. False-negative results of the LA test for cryptococcal polysaccharide antigen in cryptococcal meningitis are unusual but can be seen due to a prozone effect, and, therefore, high-risk negative specimens should be diluted and retested [33]. Low fungal burden, as in chronic low-grade cryptococcal meningitis or in the very early stages of cryptococcal infection, and improper storage of patient sera can also cause false-negative results in LA cryptococcal polysaccharide antigen tests [34].",

This assay has good performance across a broad range of clinical settings, including resource-limited settings and among cohorts with low burden of HIV infection and high rates of C. gattii infection, for which some EIA and LA tests are known to be insensitive [36\u201340]. The satisfactory performance of LFA combined with established cost-effectiveness and practical advantages of this approach support its use as a point-of-care testing (including preemptive screening of high-risk patients) in resource-limited settings [36, 37, 41].",

Generally speaking, detectable cryptococcal antigen in serum should make clinicians consider that infection is now also located outside the lung. In a high-risk patient with clinical symptoms suggestive of meningitis, identification of cryptococcal antigen in CSF or serum is rapid, specific, noninvasive, and virtually diagnostic of meningoencephalitis or disseminated cryptococcosis even when the India ink examination or culture is negative [42, 43]. The LA test for serum cryptococcal polysaccharide antigen is widely used for detecting cryptococcal infection in patients with AIDS, as an initial screening test for those with fever of unclear etiologies or neurological symptoms. In some patients, it may represent the only means of achieving an etiologic diagnosis of invasive cryptococcosis or early diagnosis prior to CNS involvement.",

After initiation of systemic antifungal therapy, patients may respond to treatment and titers of cryptococcal polysaccharide antigen fall. Similarly, a rise in CSF cryptococcal polysaccharide antigen titers during suppressive therapy has been associated with relapse [49]. However, it is important to emphasize that the use of changing antigen titers to make therapeutic decision should be done with caution, as titers may not be equivalent across different serological modalities [39].

A standard induction dose of 0.7\u20131 mg/kg/day is recommended. Liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome) at 3\u20136 mg/kg/day has become a preferred alternative treatment with similar outcomes to that of AmBd but with less nephrotoxicity and is specifically recommended for primary induction in organ transplant patients as well as patients at risk for renal dysfunction [62\u201364]. Higher doses of AmBd have been shown to be more rapidly fungicidal [65, 66]. Flucytosine (5-FC) is primarily used in combination therapy with AmBd for first-line therapy in cryptococcal meningitis or severe pulmonary cryptococcosis at a dosage of 100 mg/kg/day in divided doses in patients with normal renal function [67, 68]. The combination of AmBd and 5-FC represents the most potent fungicidal regimen with more rapid sterilization of CSF cultures at 2 weeks as demonstrated by multiple studies [66, 67, 69]. Early studies from HIV infection demonstrated increased rates of CSF sterilization and fewer relapses with the combination of AmBd and 5-FC followed by itraconazole maintenance [67]. This initial combination regimen has since been compared against multiple alternatives, with the superiority of its fungicidal activity consistently confirmed [69]. Similar results have been observed among the most severe cases of cryptococcal infection [66, 70]. Early mycological failure (as defined by persistently positive CSF cultures at day 14) has for many years been associated with late treatment failure and poor outcome [71], and lack of 5-FC has been independently associated with both early [72] and late [70] mycological failure. The improved fungicidal activity of combination therapy with AmBd plus 5-FC has been shown to translate into a direct survival benefit compared with AmBd monotherapy, with improved survival at 10 weeks lasting up to 6 months [66]. 5-FC should be dose-adjusted for renal dysfunction, with therapeutic monitoring performed 3\u20135 days after initiation of therapy, to maintain 2-h post-dose levels under 100 \u00b5g/mL (goal 30\u201380), to reduce its primary side effect of bone marrow suppression [73].",

Alternative combination therapies have been investigated, the most efficacious of which has been AmBd (0.7 mg/kg/day) plus fluconazole (800 mg/day), which has demonstrated improved rates of a composite end point of CSF culture negativity, neurological improvement, and survival compared with AmBd alone or in combination with lower doses of fluconazole [74]. Fluconazole (at doses of 800\u20131200 mg/day) in combination with AmBd (standard dosing) has been shown to demonstrate similar rates of fungal clearance from CSF as standard AmBd plus 5-FC in a randomized study performed in HIV-infected patients in South Africa [75] and offers a potential viable option for effective initial therapy in settings where access to 5-FC is limited. Whether the survival benefit observed with AmBd plus 5-FC will be observed with this regimen remains uncertain. Additional alternative regimens for primary therapy are available in the guidelines but their use is not encouraged based on limited data on the success of these regimens [76]. Use of fluconazole in the absence of a polyene is not recommended given the fungistatic nature of this drug, poor success, higher relapse rates, and increased resistance in relapse when used as monotherapy for induction [62, 77]. However, in areas without access to AmBd, high doses (1200 mg/day) of fluconazole should be commenced.",

However, given concerns regarding immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), the optimum timing for HAART initiation in the setting of OIs has been a subject of much debate. Early retrospective studies suggested an increased risk of IRIS among HIV-infected patients initiated on HAART early after the diagnosis of an OI [85, 86]. More contemporary studies have demonstrated conflicting results regarding outcomes of cryptococcal infection based on timing of HAART initiation [87\u201391]. The Cryptococcal Optimal ART Timing (COAT) study provides the best evidence for current recommendations regarding timing of HAART initiation in patients with cryptococcal meningitis [92]. HAART-na\u00efve patients were randomized to receive immediate (within 48 h) or deferred (greater than four weeks) HAART following a minimum of 7 days of antifungal therapy with AmBd and high-dose fluconazole. This trial was stopped early after interim analyses suggested poorer early survival among patients receiving immediate HAART (55 % vs. 70 %, p = 0.03), particularly among patients with altered mentation and low CSF white blood cell count. Although a trend toward increased rates of and earlier IRIS was observed in the immediate HAART group, this was not statistically significant.",

The principles of induction, consolidation, and maintenance therapy remain the same. Repeat CSF sampling at 2 weeks is recommended in this population and a longer course of induction therapy should be pursued if CSF cultures remain positive at 2 weeks, as this scenario is associated with increased 6-month mortality [94]. Unlike HIV-infected patients, relapse rates among organ transplant recipients are quite low (~ 1.3 %), such that a shorter course of maintenance therapy with fluconazole (6\u201312 months) can be pursued following standard consolidation [62, 94]. Drug interactions between fluconazole and immunosuppressive agents should be anticipated due to fluconazole-induced CYP3A4 inhibition, and preemptive adjustment (reduction) in calcineurin inhibitors should be made. Management of immunosuppression in the setting of cryptococcal infection requires recognition of the increased risk of IRIS associated with abrupt withdrawal or reduction of immunosuppression in organ transplant recipients with increased rates of allograft loss reported in some patients [95\u201397]. Stepwise reduction in immunosuppression is recommended, though the approach should be individualized for each patient.",

Very little prospective data are available on the management of cryptococcal infection among this heterogeneous group of \u201capparently immunocompetent\u201d patients lacking classical risk factors for cryptococcosis. What is known is based on early studies that included a heterogeneous mix of patients and were performed prior to acceptance of the standard algorithm of induction, consolidation, and maintenance therapy and higher-dose polyene therapy [68]. Recommendations for longer induction therapy (4 weeks or more) in this population are based on the recognition of poorer outcomes and higher mortality rates in this group of patients in both early [68, 98] and contemporary [99] studies. An additional 2 weeks of therapy should be considered if 5-FC is not included in the induction regimen [62]. Recommendations for consolidation and maintenance parallel those for HIV-infected and transplant patients, and reflect early reports of relapse rates approaching 30 % within the 1st year prior to introduction of consolidation and maintenance antifungal therapy [62, 68]. Criteria for stopping treatment in these patients include resolution of symptoms, generally following at least 1 year of suppressive therapy. Patients may have prolonged positive cryptococcal polysaccharide antigen tests and/or slightly abnormal CSF findings for months during successful therapy, and if there are concerns about cure, follow-up CSF culture should be considered.",

            "text": "Just as host factors influence management approaches for cryptococcal infection, site of infection also matters. Airway colonization in a nonimmunosuppressed individual poses a low risk for invasive pulmonary infection (and dissemination) and treatment can be deferred. Some experts would still favor treatment with fluconazole in this scenario, given the relative benign nature of this therapy. However, among immunocompromised patients with isolated pulmonary cryptococcosis, treatment is recommended to prevent dissemination [62]. It should be emphasized that a thorough evaluation to rule out systemic disease/dissemination is warranted in this group of patients to provide optimal treatment. This includes blood and CSF cultures as well as serum and CSF cryptococcal antigen testing. If the results of the above evaluation are negative, symptoms are mild, and there is no evidence of diffuse pulmonary infiltrates or ARDS, oral fluconazole (400 mg/day) is recommended for 6\u201312 months. However, in any patient in whom cryptococcemia is identified, symptoms are severe, ARDS is present, or CSF examination reveals asymptomatic CNS involvement, treatment for cryptococcal meningitis is recommended [62]. Cerebral cryptococcomas often can be managed with prolonged antifungal therapy without need for surgical removal unless mass effect or other evidence of obstruction is identified. At least 6 weeks of induction therapy with AmBd plus 5-FC, followed by 6\u201318 months of consolidation therapy with fluconazole (400\u2013800 mg/day), is recommended for management. Surgery should be considered for large lesions (> 3 cm) or the presence of obstructive hydrocephalus [62]. Localized infection of extrapulmonary nonmeningeal sites can occasionally occur with direct inoculation, but more commonly represents disseminated infection. Suspicion for the latter must be maintained when Cryptococcus is identified from a sterile body site, as management strategies will differ if disseminated disease is present. Consultation with ophthalmology is indicated in cases of cryptococcal eye disease [62].",

The differential diagnosis includes progressive disease due to persistent immune deficiency, failure of antimicrobial therapy (due to resistance or nonadherence), coinfection with other OIs, and drug toxicity. A high index of suspicion is necessary for recognizing atypical presentations or manifestations at distant sites. Nevertheless, distinguishing between disease progression related to ongoing immune deficiency and clinical deterioration due to restoration of host immunity has important management implications. CSF analyses and biomarkers may be useful in distinguishing between relapse and IRIS. Prospective studies have demonstrated that CSF opening pressure [89] and WBC count [100, 105] at the time of an IRIS event are significantly higher than baseline values for individual patients, and higher CSF opening pressures can distinguish IRIS from relapsed infection [102].",

Implicit in management is ensuring the efficacy of antifungal therapy, particularly in settings where access to AmBd may be limited and fluconazole resistance may account for recurrent meningitis episodes [120, 121]. In the absence of disease relapse or direct antifungal resistance, modification of antimicrobial therapy is not indicated [62]. Once the diagnosis of IRIS is suspected, consideration of disease severity is warranted. A significant proportion of minor cases will improve without specific treatment [86, 88, 108]. Corticosteroids have been shown to reduce the need for hospitalization and to improve short-term quality of life and functional status without increased risk of complications in paradoxical tuberculosis (TB)-associated IRIS [122]; the role of corticosteroids in cryptococcal IRIS, however, is not as well established and should be reserved for life-threatening cases, particularly in light of their association with increased mortality in one study [123]. Other anti-inflammatory agents have been used in cryptococcal IRIS, but the number of patients treated with any of these agents is too small to draw substantive conclusions [86, 124, 125]. Other management strategies, including therapeutic lumbar drainage in the setting of intracranial hypertension [62, 122, 126] and, at times, surgical drainage of suppurative lymph nodes [116, 117], are important adjunctive therapies that may be considered in severe disease.",

It is generally recognized that primary antifungal resistance to most agents is rare, although reduced susceptibility to 5-FC has been observed in untreated patients [128] and echinocandins have no reliable activity against this yeast. Reduced susceptibility to fluconazole has been described in cases of culture-positive relapsed cryptococcal meningitis associated with prior fluconazole therapy [77, 129, 130] (Table 15.6).",

            "text": "Along with the optimization of antifungal therapy, management of increased ICP is critically important. Elevated ICP is correlated with overall fungal burden, and is thought to be due to CSF outflow obstruction by clumped yeast forms [131]. An ICP of 250 mm H2O or greater is considered elevated and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality [123]. Persistently elevated ICP after 2 weeks of treatment is associated with poorer clinical responses among patients with HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis [62]. Intracranial imaging should be performed prior to lumbar puncture if impaired mentation or focal neurologic deficits are present. A baseline measurement of CSF pressure should be obtained in all patients with suspected cryptococcal meningitis. Aggressive attempts to control increased ICP should occur, if elevated and if there are signs/symptoms to suggest increased ICP (headache, mental status changes, and new focal neurological findings). Treatment options for managing acutely elevated ICP include repeated lumbar punctures (daily until pressure and symptoms are stable for > 2 days), lumbar drain insertion, ventriculostomy, or ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt (Table 15.7) [123]. Medical treatments such as corticosteroids (unless there is a component of IRIS), mannitol, and acetazolamide have been used in some cases, but are generally not recommended for use in management of increased ICP in cryptococcal meningitis [132]. Some patients may develop symptoms of obstructive hydrocephalus necessitating the placement of a permanent VP shunt during the first 1\u20132 years of treatment, and occasionally at initial presentation. Sterilization of CSF is not required prior to placement of a VP shunt, which can be inserted once a patient is receiving the appropriate antifungal therapy [133].\n",
