This event triggers a molecular triage, where the affected cell must make a decision on the fate of mRNA that is released from polysomes: decay or silencing (Anderson and Kedersha, 2008). For these events, cells have elaborated different classes of RNA granules named processing P-bodies (PBs) or stress granules (SGs) that contribute to the regulation and lifecycle of mRNAs. Both PBs and SGs contain share proteins and are assembled in cells subjected to stress, but differ in: (i) only PBs are observed in unstressed cells, (ii) SG assembly typically requires phosphorylation of translation initiation factor eIF2\u03b1, but not PB assembly (Fig. 1\n), and (iii) PBs contain proteins involved in mRNA decay, whereas SGs contain proteins of translation initiation complex (Eulalio et al., 2007).",

PBs were discovered by Bashkirov et al. (1997) and they showed that XRN1, a 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 exoribonuclease, was localized in small granular structures within the cytoplasm. Other proteins related to mRNA degradation were also found to localize to this granules, such as a deadenylase (CCR4), decapping enzymes Dcp1 and Dcp2 as well as the activators of decapping Dhh1/p54/Rck/DDX6, Pat1, Scd6/RAP55, Edc3, Hedls and Lsm1\u20137 complex (Eulalio et al., 2007, Ingelfinger et al., 2002, van Dijk et al., 2002). Moreover, PBs can contain mRNAs and proteins involved in Nonsense-Mediated Decay (NMD) (e.g., SMG5, SMG7, and UPF1) (Fukuhara et al., 2005, Unterholzner and Izaurralde, 2004) and components of the RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISC) (e.g., argonaute, microRNA and GW182) (Liu et al., 2005, Rehwinkel et al., 2005) (Fig. 2\n).",

            "text": "During a stress response, cells induce a shut-off of cellular protein synthesis and subsequently promote SG assembly (Anderson and Kedersha, 2009). Different pathways in SG assembly have been described. The most popular pathway is the phosphorylation of the critical translation initiation factor, eIF2\u03b1 by a family of four serine/threonine kinases HRI, PKR, PERK/PEK and GCN2. HRI (eIF2\u03b1K1) is activated in heme deprivation and oxidative stress (Han et al., 2001); PKR (eIF2\u03b1K2) is activated by viral infection (Williams, 2001); PERK/PEK (eIF2\u03b1K3) is activated in the presence of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and during hypoxia (Harding et al., 2000); and GCN2 (eIF2\u03b1K4) is activated during amino acid starvation and UV irradiation (Jiang and Wek, 2005). Each kinase causes the phosphorylation of the \u03b1-subunit of eIF2 at Ser52, which implies the tight binding with eIF2B, inhibiting the exchange of GDP for GTP (Fig. 1). Therefore, there is a decrease in translation tertiary complex assembly (eIF2/GTP/Met-tRNA) which suppresses the initiation of translation and promotes SG assembly (Fig. 2, step i) (Kedersha et al., 2002). Other mechanisms independent of the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 have also been explored. Hippuristanol and Pateamine A, drugs that inhibit the helicase activity of eIF4A, are able to induce the assembly of SGs (Fig. 2, step ii) (Dang et al., 2006, Mazroui et al., 2006). As well, the overexpression of SG markers (Anderson and Kedersha, 2008), such as TIA1 (Kedersha et al., 1999) or G3BP-1 (Tourriere et al., 2003), can trigger the assembly of SGs (Fig. 2, step iii).",

Moreover, some viral proteins can bind eIF4A (Aoyagi et al., 2010, Page and Read, 2010). All of these mechanisms induce SG assembly (i.e., shut-off of cellular protein synthesis), but the viruses have found ways to bypass the hostile environment generated by the cell to ensure their survival. In the last decade, several studies have also demonstrated that the assembly of SGs can be dramatically influenced by viruses: the induction and blockage of SG assembly mediated by viral infections have both been described as means to promote virus replication (Beckham and Parker, 2008, Montero and Trujillo-Alonso, 2011, White and Lloyd, 2012). In this review we will summarize the current understanding that exists between different virus families and the regulation of stress granules.",

Li et al. showed that the negative strand 3\u2032 terminal stem\u2013loop structure present in the genome of West-Nile Virus (WNV) interacts with two SG markers, TIA-1 and TIAR (Li et al., 2002). In support of the necessity for these virus\u2013host interactions, WNV replication was reduced when TIAR\u2212/\u2212 cells were infected (Li et al., 2002). WNV is a neurotropic flavivirus responsible for viral meningoencephalitis which has an enzootic cycle between mosquitoes and birds, but can infect amphibians, reptiles, horses and humans (Dauphin et al., 2004). Moreover, Emara et al. expanded these observations to other members of the same viral flaviviridae family, where TIA-1/TIAR were shown to co-localize with viral replication complexes (dsRNA and NS3) in both WNV- and dengue virus-infected cells (Emara and Brinton, 2007). SGs can be induced in mammalian cells by several drugs (Kedersha and Anderson, 2007), apparently as a consequence of the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1. In order to determine if viral infection would have any effect on SG assembly, Baby Hamster Kidney (BHK) cells were infected with wild-type WNV and subjected to arsenite-mediated oxidative stress. Infected cells were found to be resistant to SG induction (Emara and Brinton, 2007). However, recent studies showed that chimeric WNV produces high levels of an early viral RNA (W956IC), allowing PKR activation and subsequent induction of SG, likely due to translational arrest (Courtney et al., 2012).",

This blockade to SG assembly was found to be due to an interaction between G3BP-1 and the HCV non-structural protein, (NS)5B and the 5\u2032 end of the HCV minus-strand RNA (Yi et al., 2011).

Pelletier et al. discovered that the translation of the uncapped picornaviral mRNA is mediated by an RNA structure known as the internal ribosome entry site, IRES, at the 5\u2032 end of the viral RNA (Pelletier et al., 1988). Infection by poliovirus (PV), the etiologic agent of paralytic disease known as poliomyelitis, induces the inhibition of cap-dependent translation initiation by the cleavage of the translation initiation factors eIF4GI, eIF4GII, and PABP mediated by viral proteinases (Gradi et al., 1998, Kuyumcu-Martinez et al., 2002). SG assembly is induced at a very early time post-PV infection (at approximately 2\u20134 h), but later, SGs disappear because the same viral 3C proteinase (3Cpro) cleaves G3BP-1, but not TIA-1 or TIAR, and thereby prevents SG assembly (White et al., 2007). The SGs found in PV-infected cells contain viral RNA and TIA-1, but are compositionally distinct since they exclude well-described SG components such as G3BP-1, PABP, and eIF4G, all of which are eventually cleaved by 3Cpro (Piotrowska et al., 2010, White and Lloyd, 2011). Furthermore, PV infection also disrupts the assembly of PBs. Also during PV infection, Xrn1, Dcp1a and Pan3, three factors involved in mRNA decapping, degradation and deadenylation, respectively, undergo degradation or cleavage by the viral 3Cpro (Dougherty et al., 2011).",

PABP, that is bound to poly (A) 3\u2032 tail, interacts with eIF4GI at the 5\u2032, causing circularization of the mRNA by linking the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 mRNA ends, increasing the binding of eIF4E to the cap (Lopez-Lastra et al., 2010). Rotavirus, the causative agent of a common infantile gastroenteritis, subverts the host translation machinery at this step. Because rotavirus mRNAs are capped but lack poly(A) tails, the virus-encoded protein, non-structural (NS) P3, binds to a consensus RNA sequence in the 3\u2032 end of viral mRNA, enabling mRNA circularization by interaction with eIF4GI (Piron et al., 1998). As a consequence, a shut-off of host protein synthesis ensues and thereby provides an advantage for viral protein synthesis. In infected cells, Montero et al. found that eIF2\u03b1 is phosphorylated during the entire virus replication cycle but this does not have an impact in the formation of viroplasms (cytoplasmic viral factories found in rotavirus-infected cells) or viral replication and surprisingly, SG assembly was not induced. One possibility for explain this observation may be due to PABP, a component of SG (Table 1), is able to translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in rotavirus infected cells in a NSP3-dependent manner (Montero et al., 2008).",

Rather, when JUNV-infected cells were treated with hippuristanol, an eIF4A-helicase activity inhibitor that induces SGs in an eIF2\u03b1-independent manner (Mazroui et al., 2006), SG assembly was observed in 100% of cells indicating that JUNV affects an unidentified event downstream of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation or the integrity of viral mRNAs on polysomes (Linero et al., 2011).",

            "text": "Another virus that efficiently shuts off host protein synthesis is influenza A virus (IAV) (Kash et al., 2006). IAV is an animal pathogen that causes severe respiratory disease and pandemics in humans around the world. Viral transcription involves a cap-snatching mechanism during which a nucleotide sequence between 10 and 20 nt, including the 5\u2032 cap structure, is cleaved from the 5\u2032 end of cellular mRNAs. This sequence is used to prime transcription on the viral genome and is ultimately used during translation initiation of viral mRNAs (Lopez-Lastra et al., 2010). Additionally, IAV encodes cap-binding proteins that are able to preferentially recognize capped viral mRNAs. The influenza non-structural protein 1 (NS1) binds eIF4GI and PABP-1, thus stimulating the assembly of the translation initiation complex on capped IAV mRNAs (Lopez-Lastra et al., 2010). IAV actively suppresses SG assembly during viral infection, thereby allowing translation of viral mRNAs. Complete inhibition of SG assembly is dependent on the function of NS1 and its ability to inhibit PKR, the double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (Khaperskyy et al., 2011).",

            "text": "Recently, retroviruses such as the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) and human T-cell lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1) were shown to impose a blockade to SG assembly in infected cells. Recent work from the authors\u2019 laboratory showed that HIV-1 preferably assembles ribonucleoprotein complexes to which Staufen1, the viral genomic RNA and the structural protein Gag are recruited, called Staufen1 HIV-1-dependent RNPs (SHRNPs). These were compositionally different than SGs since they did not contain many of the classical SG marker proteins G3BP-1, eIF3, TIA-1, TIAR, HuR, PABP-1, but contained Staufen1. The assembly SHRNPs during the late stages of viral replication is believed to impose a blockade to the assembly of SGs but to favor the encapsidation of HIV-1 genomic RNA into assembling virus (Abrahamyan et al., 2010, White and Lloyd, 2012). Follow-up work, reported at the last International Nucleocapsid (NC) Meeting in Barcelona, Spain in September 2011, now demonstrates that the viral Gag protein controls the kinetics of SG assembly and interferes with the cellular stress response pathway (Valiente-Echeverr\u00eda et al., unpublished). The oncoretrovirus, HTLV-1 elicits a blockade to SG assembly in a different manner and this was found to be mediated by the viral regulatory protein, Tax. Legros et al. observed that Tax relocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in response to environmental stress. While Tax is present in the cytoplasm, it interacts with histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), a critical component of SGs (Kwon et al., 2007), and thereby impairs SG assembly (Legros et al., 2011). While the details on the mechanisms by which viruses elicit favorable environments in which to replicate will require further work, the sequestration of critical factors for the induction of SGs by viral proteins appears to be an increasingly studied area of research and should yield important new information on how viruses gain control over host cell biology.",

            "text": "While all of the examples described above belong to RNA viruses, Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) are the only members of the DNA virus family that have been shown to regulate SG assembly. HSV-1 causes a shut-off of host cell protein synthesis by the virion host shutoff (Vhs) protein and subsequently induces degradation of cellular RNAs (Kwong and Frenkel, 1987). Several Adenosine\u2013Uracil (AU)-rich binding proteins that promote mRNA stability, such as TIA-1/TIAR, and TTP (Bevilacqua et al., 2003), were upregulated in HSV-1 infected cells (Esclatine et al., 2004). TTP and TIA-1/TIAR were activated during the infection and accumulated in the cytoplasm, but only TTP was able to interact with Vhs. As a consequence, SGs were not observed after infection (Esclatine et al., 2004). More recently, Finnen et al. have shown that HSV-2 infection blocks SG accumulation in cells exposed to arsenite-mediated oxidative stress, but not in cells exposed to Pateamine A, a drug that induces SG assembly in an eIF2\u03b1-independent manner (Finnen et al., 2012). These results were similar to those found in JUNV infected cells described above (Linero et al., 2011). On the other hand, HCMV infection induces an unfolded protein response (UPR), activates PERK, but eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation levels were limited and viral RNA translation was maintained (Isler et al., 2005b). Likewise, the same group showed that SG assembly was suppressed in HCMV infected cells treated with the ER stressor, thapsigargin (Isler et al., 2005a). As discussed in the previous section, viruses have chosen different mechanisms to inhibit the SG assembly to ensure efficient and unmitigated replication.",

            "text": "The role of the stress response involving SGs in the Reoviridiae family of viruses has been shown to be implicated in viral replication. Mammalian orthoreovirus (MRV) infection in humans is usually asymptomatic or associated with symptoms of a common cold. During the early stages of infection, MRV induces SG assembly and the expression of ATF4, a transcription factor, through eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation (Smith et al., 2006). The assembly of SGs creates a competitive advantage for the viral mRNA to be translated because cellular mRNAs are sequestered in SG. When ATF4 is expressed in MRV infected cells, viral production increases by up to 100-fold (Smith et al., 2006). A later study implicated a role for SG assembly in viral replication since SG formation occurs after viral uncoating but before viral mRNA transcription (Qin et al., 2009). Qin et al. (2011) found that viral mRNAs escape translational inhibition when SGs are disrupted and viral translation occurs in the presence of high levels of phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 in a manner that is independent of PKR inhibition. This study also mentions that MRV-infected Cos7 cells are able to block the assembly of SGs induced by arsenite-mediated oxidative stress later in infection (Qin et al., 2011). The implication of these findings is that the stress response and the resulting assembly of SGs must be involved in the early stages of the viral replication cycle but is ultimately detrimental to the virus if it is not able to disassemble SG during later stages of infection.",

The mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV), which is closely related to the SARS coronavirus, has been shown to subvert the host translation machinery through eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation (Raaben et al., 2007). eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation also leads to the assembly of SG and PB. A genome wide microarray analysis of regulated mRNAs in MHV-infected LR7 cells revealed the decrease in the expression of many cellular mRNAs, which may be due to an increase in PBs activity and function (Raaben et al., 2007). Likewise, viral RNAs transcripts make up 40% of total RNA in the cell, so the virus may be overloading the host cell cytoplasm to ensure that its transcripts will be translated (Raaben et al., 2007). However, the authors come to the conclusion that the inhibition of cellular translation is not beneficial to the virus since in systems lacking the ability to inhibit cellular translation, viral production did not change and thus, the assembly of SG in MHV-infected cells does not appear to dramatically favor viral replication (Raaben et al., 2007).",

These aggregates differ from typical SG because they do not contain proteins such as PABP and TIA-1 (Table 1). RUBV is a positive strand RNA where viral replication is mediated for intermediary double stranded RNA (dsRNA). Matthews et al. found that G3BP-1 does not overlap with dsRNA, but rather colocalizes with viral ssRNA in perinuclear clusters (Matthews and Frey, 2012), suggesting that these may represent sites of encapsidation (Beatch and Hobman, 2000).",

            "text": "Despite an intensifying research focus to understand the relationships between the cytoplasmic RNPs called SG and virus replication (refer to Table 2\n), many questions remain to be answered in this growing field of virology. The roles for many SG components (Table 1) that have been found to participate in viral replication either by inclusion or exclusion still remain incompletely defined in host cell biology. As well, the literature has only touched the surface as to how viruses hijack and commandeer SG components. In several cases in which SG assembly is shown to be inhibited, it remains unclear if viruses block the assembly or induce the disassembly of SG. There is also a need to determine at what level viruses are hijacking or co-opting the host cell stress responses that exhibit SG. There is also a need to understand how SG may lead to deleterious effects if they remain present during viral infection. Indeed, further characterization of a virus\u2019 ability to overcome the inhibition of SG assembly or induce their assembly to prevent translation of host mRNAs may be beneficial in developing new anti-viral drugs that could be useful against multiple viruses. Anti-cancer drugs such as etoposide, bortezomib and doxorubicin, do induce SG assembly, however their roles as anti-virals are not known (Arimoto et al., 2008, Fournier et al., 2010, Morita et al., 2012). The many mechanisms by which viruses inhibit or induce SG may pose a problem to developing a broad anti-viral drug targeting SG. Viruses such as PV, which inhibit SG formation through cleavage, would likely be unaffected by drugs that activate the stress response upstream of these cleaved factors. Another caveat to the potential use of these drugs is that SG formation may help the replication of certain viruses which induce SG to create a better environment for viral replication. The knowledge gained on the biology of SG and how it is influenced by viral infections will play a role in further characterizing innate responses to infection and how this system can be taken advantage of to curb viral infections.",
