Subsequently, with nearly 6 million South Africans living with HIV or AIDS, it remains the nation with the largest number of people living with HIV in the global community.

Therefore, with ongoing advances in preventing, diagnosing, treating, and supporting persons living with HIV or AIDS, including those affected, it is critical to support lifelong learning through capacity building or in-service programs. Again, as in preservice education, these competencies can serve as a framework to health care organizations validating the competencies of nurses in relation to HIV and AIDS or to capacity building programs funded to enhance the ability of nursing to comprehensively address the complex issues related to the HIV and AIDS epidemics.",
