At home, China has experienced unprecedented material improvements, doubling its gross domestic product per capita, for example, between 2002 and 2006. What are the major challenges for the health of the Chinese people? What are the implications for global health? The authors of the papers in this special issue of The Lancet on China's health system were invited to address these questions as China's global engagement continues to expand in the opening decade of the 21st century.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18\n",

Health transitions that took nearly a century in other richer countries have taken place in a few decades in China.3, 4 Third, China's unique national history and ecology have resulted in great diversity in health conditions and responses. Many aspects of health in China will demonstrate both commonality and exceptionalism within the country and among nation states. An example is medical ethics and human rights, in which China has been moving towards universal norms while at the same time contributing a unique tradition of Chinese philosophy and values.16 And fourth, China increasingly has the economic capacity to make profound advances in health. China's spectacular economic growth enables it to augment its investments in health substantially.",
