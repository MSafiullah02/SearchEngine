They have a single-stranded DNA genome which encodes two capsid proteins (VP1 and VP2) and two non-structural proteins (NS1 and NS2). The CPV-2 emerged from a FPLV or a closely related virus as a novel pathogen in the late 1970s (Shackelton et al., 2005) and rapidly spread worldwide. Within a few years, the virus underwent a rapid evolution and, new antigenic types, termed CPV-2a, CPV-2b and CPV-2c (Buonavoglia et al., 2001, Parrish et al., 1985, Parrish et al., 1988), replaced the original type CPV-2 (Truyen, 2006).",

            "text": "Clinical diagnosis of CPV-2 infection can be inconclusive, since several other pathogens may cause diarrhea in dogs. For this reason, a clinical diagnosis should always be confirmed by laboratory tests. For FPLV, which can cause anorexia, weight loss, vomiting and diarrhea, even the finding of severe leucopenia with compatible clinical signs is presumptive without laboratorial confirmation tests. Several methods have been developed for the laboratory diagnosis of CPV-2 or FPLV infection. Usually, feces from diarrheic cats and dogs are screened using ELISA or hemagglutination (HA) tests, but these techniques are affected by relatively low sensitivity (Mochizuki et al., 1993, Uwatoko et al., 1995). Additionally, the HA method depends upon the antigenic structures in the virus capsid. Virus mutants with amino acid changes in regions determining the antigenicity may exhibit altered hemagglutination capacity (Strassheim et al., 1993). Virus isolation in cell lines can also be used; however the technique requires a time period of at least 3\u20134 days, and, some strains do not produce clear cytopathic effects in the cell culture (Decaro et al., 2005). Molecular methods to detect CPV-2 and FPLV have been described, mostly based upon the polymerase chain reaction for the detection of the parvovirus in feces of dogs and cats (Buonavoglia et al., 2001, Hirasawa et al., 1996, Schunck et al., 1995). In the last ten years, several methods to detect CPV-2 were reported applying the real-time PCR technology. The comparison of the conventional PCR with the real-time PCR demonstrated a greater sensitivity for the latter one (Decaro et al., 2005, Kumar and Nandi, 2010), progressively replacing the virus isolation and HA as the standard procedure for virus surveillance and virus diagnosis. However, a technique able to detect the virus in feces of clinical compromised animals and to quantify the virus in body fluids from sick and healthy animals was not described. Additionally, with the increased number of novel strains (containing new nucleotide substitution), an upgrade in the used primers becomes important. Based upon this, the aim of the present study was to develop a qPCR method applying the TaqMan technology for the detection and quantitation of CPV-2 and FPLV in serum and fecal samples.",

In total 503 sequences of the VP2 gene were obtained for both viruses. The dataset was aligned by applying the ClustalW method in the MEGA 4 software (Tamura et al., 2007). Several primers and probes were designed by using the software Primer 3 v. 0.4.0 (http://primer3.sourceforge.net/). The chosen primers and probes were selected by matching them with the alignment. The nucleotide sequences were: Primer Forward 5\u2032-TGGAACTAGTGGCACACCAA (nucleotide position number 3456\u20133473, according the reference canine parvovirus strains CPV-N, GenBank accession number: M19296), Primer Reverse 5\u2032-AAATGGTGGTAAGCCCAATG (3636\u20133655) and the Probe 5\u2032-CAGGTGATGAATTTGCTACAGG (3555\u20133576). Potential hairpins and self dimerization were calculated using OligoCalc software (Kibbe, 2007). Primers and probe were obtained from TIB MOLBIOL Syntheselabor (Berlin, Germany).

            "text": "Real-time PCR is an attractive alternative to conventional PCR for the study of the virus load with low inter-assay and intra-assay variability (Mackay et al., 2002). The analytical sensitivity of the real-time PCR is equivalent or greater compared with traditional virus culture, immunofluorescence, conventional single-round PCR and nested-PCR (Mackay et al., 2002). Such methods may demand tissue culture to isolate the virus or serological methods to determine the identity of the isolate, are known to be highly time and labor consumptive. In contrast, the real-time PCR method facilitates a large increase in the throughput, enables simultaneous processing of several samples and provides the possibility of computer based data analysis of the results.",

            "text": "The real-time PCR approach described above has high sensitivity in both matrices tested (feces and sera) and was able to detect as few as 18 copies of DNA per microliter in every test round. This is in accordance with other quantitative methods for the detection of CPV-2 based upon the real-time PCR (Decaro et al., 2005, Kumar and Nandi, 2010), highlighting the excellent suitability of the real-time PCR method for canine and feline parvovirosis diagnosis. When the method was used for samples collected for clinical purposes, a higher sensitivity compared to the IF technique and conventional PCR could clearly be observed. This sensitivity may permit insights in the time course of viral loads in serum samples, even in the complete absence of clinical symptoms. This can represent an advantage for vaccine development tests or vaccine efficacy tests, when even low amounts of DNA are important to be measured. As additional advantage, this method was designed to detect both canine and feline parvoviruses. Therefore in cats, that may be infected by both viruses, only one diagnostic test is needed to confirm the diagnosis. Notably, it has been observed that canine and feline parvoviruses displays high evolutionary rates (Shackelton et al., 2005), and for this reason, nucleotide substitutions are a frequent finding. In the present study, the high number of sequences used to select the primers provides an upgraded method for the detection of those viruses and reduces the probability of false-negative detection due to new viral mutations.",
