Notes 1, A vast range of MAbs to viral antigens are available commerctally and through other channels, but very few of these are likely to be suitable for diagnostic purposes. Some currently available MAbs or MAb pools designed for antigen detection in clinical material are listed m Table 1 . Also noteworthy are the polyvalent pools of antibodies to RSV, the mfluenzavtruses, the paramfluenza vnuses, and adenoviruses produced by some manufacturers. These allow one-test screenmg Toms for significant respiratory virus pathogens, reducing the costly screening of negative samples against multiple type specific reagents. 2.

It is always advisable to titrate new antibody preparations in your laboratory. Normally, testing preparattons fivefold either side of the recommended dtlutton on known positive control material will suffice. 10 . For cell culture preparations, in which nonspecific stainmg is less troublesome, 5-min soaks will suffice. 11. In the direct test the controls should Include: a. A cell preparation similar to the test specimen but known to be negative for the virus m question and stamed m parallel with the test specimen. b. A duplicate preparation of the test specrmen stained with a negative control comugated antibody as similar as possible to the virus-spectfic comugated antibody to be employed. Where a polyclonal antibody from an animal has been purified and comugated, the most suitable control would be the preimmune serum from the same animal similarly purltied and conjugated. Where such is not available, a similar conjugated anttserum from the same species but specific for an antigen known to be absent from the test specimen will suffice. Where conjugated MAbs are employed, a conjugated MAb of the same immunoglobulin class but specific for an antigen known to be absent from the test specimen should be used. The specificity of fluorescent staining can be confirmed m a subsequent blocking test. Here, preparations of the test specrmen are preincubated with either unconJugated virus-specrfic antrbody or UnconJugated negative-control antibody. On subsequent staining with ConJugated antibody, specific fluorescent staining will be blocked by the latter but not the former 12.
