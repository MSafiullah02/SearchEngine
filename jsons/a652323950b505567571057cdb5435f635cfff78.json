This enzyme is a promising target for the treatment of prostate carcinoma, since it is crucial in the biosynthesis of androgens, which stimulate the proliferation of cancer cells. Fluorine not only interacts directly with nearby amino acid residues (Arg 109, Lys 231 and His 235) in a multipolar manner, but also influences the molecular electrostatic potentials of the molecule. This leads to improved T-stacking between the A-ring and Phe 114 and strengthens the sp2 N\u00c0Fe coordination. For more information, see the Full Paper by R. W. Hartmann et al. on p. 899 ff.",
