Nevertheless life threatening infections are not always prevented and the annual mortality rate is estimated at around 5%, with invasive aspergillosis being the most common cause of death [2]. Furthermore complications arise from granuloma formation leading to organ obstruction and restrictive pulmonary function. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from matched sibling donors (MSD) has been successfully performed for a number of years [3]. If no MSD is available, HSCT from a matched unrelated donor (MUD) has become an alternative, but so far there are only few cases published. Here, we report our recent experience of HSCT in CGD which includes nine cases undergoing this treatment from MUD.",

Other complications included lymph node or liver abscesses (n = 9), osteomyelitis (n = 2) and granuloma formation involving the lungs (n = 5) and the central nervous system (n = 1). Notably lung function prior to HSCT was normal in only five individuals. Conditioning regimens differed (Table 2). The three patients transplanted from MSD received busulfan (16 mg/kg) and cyclophosphamide (200 mg/kg). Six of the patients transplanted from MUD received busulfan (16 mg/kg), cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg) and fludarabine (160 mg/m2) in addition to antithymocyte globuline or anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody. Two patients were conditioned with fludarabine (160 mg/m2), melphalane (70 mg/m2) in addition to treatment with radioimmunotherapy (UPN 614, 621). The one remaining patient was conditioned with total body irradiation and fludarabine (UPN 544). Three of nine children tranplanted from a MUD (UPN 508, 494, 513) received granulocyte transfusions in aplasia as infectious prophylaxis.\n\n",

Another patient grafted from MSD died from systemic BK virus infection at 8 weeks post HSCT (UPN 521). The third patient suffered from therapy-resistant chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). He succumbed to the sequelae of an encephalitis with cerebrovascular stroke 18 months after HSCT from a MUD (UPN 513). Chimerism is complete in 8 of 9 surviving patients (Table 3). Graft failure occurred in 2 patients, both transplanted from a MUD. One of these patients rejected the first transplant early and engrafted after receiving a second transplant on day +35, but died from chronic GvHD (UPN 513). The other patient who was conditioned with RIT in addition to fludarabine melphalane and ATG had progressive graft failure with recurrence of disease (UPN 614). He is scheduled for retransplantion. Two patients developed chronic GvHD of whom one died (UPN 513) and the other requires intermittent oxygen for GvHD of the lungs (UPN 461). At present lung function remains pathologic in two individuals, while two patients recovered normal lung function (Table 2).\n\n",

Both infections and granuloma formation often result in permanent lung damage. Control of chronic inflammation by granulomas requires long-term systemic immunosuppression which often aggravates growth failure in CGD patients. With the introduction of antibiotic prophylaxis, survival improved to over 90% in patients under the age of 10 years [5]. Despite an increase in the mean age of survivors from 8 to 16 years, in a Japanese cohort the overall mortality remained unchanged at around 20% [6]. Survival data of the United States CGD registry indicate that mortality in patients with XL-CGD is about 5% per year [2]. One-third of deaths in this registry were due to aspergillus infection. Other reasons for this limited prognosis are due to progressive pulmonary restriction and also non-compliance with medication in adolescents.",
