However, few hospitals and health care institutions offer universal bereavement care to all families of patients who die. The current COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted this gap and created a sense of urgency, from a public health perspective, for institutions to provide support to bereaved family members. In this article, drawing upon the palliative care and bereavement literature, we offer suggestions about how to incorporate palliative care tools and psychological strategies into bereavement care for families during this pandemic.",

In-person patient and family meetings, conversations at the bedside, and efforts to discharge patients to home or to hospice have been replaced with remote conversations, isolation, and the very real possibility that patients will die alone, separated from their loved ones.",

            "text": "The death of a loved one is considered the most powerful stressor in everyday life with bereaved individuals at increased risk of adverse mental and physical health outcomes (1, 2) . How a person copes after the death of a significant loved one is influenced by personality and coping style, the relationship with the deceased, and the circumstances of the death (3). While the majority of bereaved individuals adjust to their loss without requiring professional intervention (4), public health models estimate that approximately 10% of bereaved individuals are at 'high risk' of developing complex grief reactions possibly requiring intervention from a mental health professional, and an additional 30% are considered at 'moderate risk' and might benefit from group support (5) . Risk factors for poor bereavement outcomes include a history of past psychiatric issues, lack of social support, a sudden or traumatic death, lack of preparation for the death, a hospital-based death, and a death in the ICU (2,6-8). Following a death in the ICU, specific risk factors for complicated grief reactions, such as prolonged grief disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder, include the patient dying while intubated, family members not able to say goodbye, and poor communication between physicians and the patient's family (9) . Clearly, some of these risk factors are heightened for any death during this pandemic, whether the death was a direct result of COVID-19 or not. Patients with COVID-19, however, can have a clinical course that increases these risks, including a precipitous decline and death or, conversely, a prolonged ICU stay.",

Similarly, in a bereavement study conducted at our cancer institute (15) , bereaved family members were asked what they wished the clinical team could have done prior to their loved one's death that would have helped them in dealing with their loss. The most common themes identified included providing more accurate information about prognosis, the endof-life period and the dying process, earlier referral to hospice and more caregiver support prior to the patient's death. Conversely, when asked what helped them in dealing with their loss, the family members reported compassionate care by the team, including communication that conveyed empathy, caring and concern for both the patient and caregiver. Bereavement outreach from the providers and the offering of condolences were also found to be helpful.",

Caring for families prior to the patient's death to facilitate post-loss adjustment Palliative care provides the framework for caring for patients and their families in the most difficult of circumstances. Even without full access to all of the palliative care tools used routinely to care for patients, there is still much we can do to help families prepare for their loved one's death.

The cognitive model provides a framework for identifying and challenging unhelpful thoughts or beliefs that might result in feelings of guilt, anger or blame (21).

Encourage bereaved individuals to follow a routine, pay attention to their self-care, including checking in with their doctor, and maintain social connections using technology. Suggest they consider holding a 'virtual celebration of life' with family and friends to reminisce, or writing their loved one a letter, telling them what they wish they could have said, especially if they weren't able to have a 'proper goodbye'. They can also consider planning a memorial event when able to at a later date. (15, 17, 21, 25) Challenge unhelpful thinking without dismissing the emotion Helps restructure unhelpful thinking. Within the context of a therapeutic relationship and drawing from CBT strategies, the bereaved is gently encouraged to express their thoughts and feelings, and identify and challenge those thoughts that are leading to guilt, blame or anger. A useful question to help shift perspective is: \"What would you say to a friend in the same situation?\" (3, 21, 25) Suggest support groups Helps provide social connections and normalization of grieving process. Support groups require careful screening of participants to assess appropriateness, readiness and timing for a group, especially given the extraordinary circumstances of the pandemic.
