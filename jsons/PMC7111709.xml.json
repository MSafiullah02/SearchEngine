It belongs to one of the three superfamilies of peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases (PPIase) that binds to the immunosuppressive agent cyclosporine A with high affinity [1]. The member of Cyp was first identified in mammals, where first human Cyp was identified as a specific cytosolic binding protein for the immunosuppressive cyclosporin A (CsA) drug [2]. Both Cyclosporine and Cyclophilin A make a complex (CypA-Cs) that bind to and inhibit the calcineurin and protein phosphatase activity, which further lead to the prevention of T-cell activation in mammals [3,4]. Cyps are much conserved, ubiquitously distributed and is one of the most abundant proteins (about 0.1\u20130.4%) in the cytoplasm [[5], [6], [7]]. It plays an important role in diverse biological activities, i.e., transcriptional regulation, immunomodulation, cell signaling, protein folding, and trafficking [8,9].",

CypA was among the first identified cyclophilins, discovered independently by two researchers in 1984 [2,13]. Later in 1989, amino acid sequence analysis confirmed that these proteins were the same [14,15]. CypA increased the proliferation of human pancreatic and lung cancer cells by the activation of p38-MAPK and Extracellular signal-Regulated Kinase 1/2 (ERK 1/2) pathways [16]. The CypA has also acted against immune-mediated injuries, e.g., Acetaminophen liver toxicity [17]. It also induced the release of Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein- 1 (MCP-1), inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-8, MMP-2, and MMP-9), and cartilage destruction during rheumatoid arthritis [18,19]. Likewise, in hepatocellular carcinoma (SK-Hep-1) cell line, Cyp A upregulated the expression of many cytokine-related genes like IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL3 [20].",

            "text": "Nervous necrosis virus (Betanodavirus) is a small non-enveloped virus having a coat of icosahedral shape (T = 3). It causes viral nervous necrosis (VNN) or viral encephalopathy and retinopathy (VER) which primarily affect the brain and eyes of juveniles and hatchery-reared larvae of several marine fish species [21]. Its genome composes of two segmented positive single-stranded RNAs i.e., RNA1 & RNA2, which encodes RdRP (RNA dependent RNA polymerase) and Capsid genes, respectively [22]. In recent years, these viruses have attracted much attention because of their ecological and economic impacts on the aquaculture industry [[23], [24], [25]]. To date, numerous organisms Cyps are reported with its specific roles in regulating the life cycle and replication of several viruses such as in facilitating the virus replication that including HCV [26], HCMV [27], HIV-1 [28], HBV [29], Corona virus [30], Vaccinia virus [31], Vesicular stomatis virus [32] etc. Conversely, there are viruses reported to be inhibited by CypA comprising of Influenza virus [33] and Rota virus [34,35]. Thus, it is clear that CypA can able to regulate the stability between the host and a pathogen in either beneficial or destructive manner through different pathways. Since, its role in pathogenesis CypA is considered as a biomarker for disease and been an appealing target for preparation of therapeutic agents. Hence, it is important to reveal the critical role of Grouper fish CypA in the regulation of infectivity and replication of Red-spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV), and these results might offer insight into the complexity of the virus-host interactions also worth of proposing CypA as a target for anti-viral therapy for future.",

The complete nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acids lists are presented in Fig. 1\nA.

The figure highlights the secondary structure along with its confidence rate where 9 different color bands in the figure highlights the specific intensity of the confidence rate. The 3D structure of GF-CypA as shown in Fig. 1C was also predicted through Phyre2 online software. To further evaluate the molecular evolution of GF-CypA, a phylogenetic tree was constructed based on multiple sequence alignments species as mentioned earlier. As shown in Fig. 1D, the phylogenetic analysis clearly showed that CypA gene obtained from GF-1 cells was formed from the teleost, amphibian, arthropod, avian, and mammalian clade. To get information about the conserved domains of GF-CypA protein, amino acid sequence of 8 different species, including mammal (Homo sapiens), avian (Gallus gallus), amphibian (Xenopus laevis), arthropods (Penaeus monodon, Scylla paramamosain), mollusks (Azumapecten farreri) and Pisces (Ictalurus punctatus, Tachysurus fulvidraco) were aligned.

Knockdown of specific genes for 12 h and expression at the transcriptional level was measured by qRT-PCR analysis. Notably, 10 \u03bcM siRNA concentrations had significantly down-regulated the expression of Cyp-164-siRNA and Cyp-287-siRNA genes to about 80 and 70%, respectively, whereas no altered expression was seen in the control (NS-siRNA) cells (Fig. 4\nA). Conversely, the relative expression levels of RGNNV after 12 hpi in both 164-siRNA and 287-siRNA knockdown cells showed a remarkable comeback, compared with the cells transfected with NS-siRNA. Western blot results further confirmed the knockdown of cells and the down-regulation of CypA specific proteins, also, significant overcome of RGNNV protein expression levels compared with the NS-siRNA knockdown cells (Fig. 4B).",

In the current study, we measured the mRNA levels of several cytokines that including ISG-15, TNF-2, IL-1B, and TNF-\u03b1 at different time periods in GF-1 cells infected with RGNNV by qRT-PCR. The transcript levels in GF-1 cells before infection were set as 1. Fig. 5\nA shows the expression levels of ISG-15 that upregulated significantly at 3, 6, and 12 h and reached a peak at 24 hpi. However, we also observed a significant decrease in the expression of genes at 48 hpi. Similar gradual and significant increasing expression pattern was observed in IL-1B, and the expression was continued up to 48 hpi with RGNNV infection (Fig. 5B). While mRNA for TNF-2 analysis revealed a significant increase in 3 hpi and steadily decreased up to 12 hpi, still the second peak of expression could be observed at 24 hpi and again decreased at 48 hpi (Fig. 5C). Though, the TNF-\u03b1 gene expression was not significantly increased (0.25) at 3, where at 6 hpi significantly increased and a sudden increase was stalled at 12 hpi (4.0) then progressively dropped until 48 hpi with RGNNV (Fig. 5D).",

In this study, we discovered the grouper Cyclophilin A and named as GF-CypA after red spotted grouper fish. This is the first ever report of cloning and regulation study of Grouper fish Cyclophilin A. The full-length cDNA of GF-CypA was 743 bp, including an ORF of 495 bp encoding a polypeptide of 164 amino acids. These results are consistent with the sequence analysis of other known CypAs such as Pelteobagrus fulvidraco [37] and Penaeus monodon [38]. Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid sequences were compared with 10 animals in different taxa for molecular evolutionary studies of grouper CypA. The tree imprints classical taxonomy and phylogenetic transition from invertebrates to vertebrates, from aquatic to terrestrial, indicating that all Cyclophilins were evolved from a single clade, might have related biological functions and shared the same ancestral gene. Numerous reports have indicated that CypA was involved in various pathological conditions, including inflammation and infection [39,40]. Further to investigate the role of GF-CypA in defending infections, the expression of Cyclophilin A in GF-1 cells during RGNNV infection was measured by qRT-PCR. Interestingly, the expression of RGNNV and CypA were gradual and significantly increased in GF-1 cells till 12 hpi. However, the substantial decrease at 24 hpi remains unclear, further transcriptomic and gene expression investigations might reveal the exact immune mechanisms of GF-1 cells related to RGNNV infection, as observed by Pozo and colleagues in European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) and gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) head-kidney leucocytes (HKLs) infected with NNV [41]. The expression pattern of GF-CypA was added to the universality and the importance of the role-played by Cyclophilin A family. These results were in line with Liu and co-workers [42], they suggested that CypA expression level was up-regulated in response to avian H9N2 virus infection in human cells.",

In the current study, overexpression of Cyclophilin A down-regulated the RGNNV replication, while knocking down of CypA in GF-1 cells led to the overexpression of RGNNV. These results suggested that GF-CypA has a host inhibitory factor during RGNNV infection. In the previous study, overexpression of CypA was observed during the influenza virus infection in human gastric carcinoma (AGS) cell line [43]. It could be due to host antiviral response and CypA may play an essential role in the immune system of red spotted grouper. On the other hand, some researchers have reported that CypA was necessary for replication of HCV [44,45]. It is noteworthy that the CypA protein can play distinctive roles in different viruses. The peculiar contrivance of CypA during RGNNV infection may need to be elucidated in future studies.",
