            "text": "Immune-mediated adverse effects may occur in patients after a pharmaceutical product is administered to treat or diagnose a disease1\u20134. When such reactions occur minutes to hours after systemic, intravenous product administration, they are often called infusion reactions, hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis. However, there is no uniform terminology, and the use of these terms largely depends on the field of study (clinical oncology versus immunology, for example). The World Allergy Organization classifies hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) as immediate (occurring within minutes to hours of exposure) or delayed (requiring days before clinical manifestation)2,3. According to the World Allergy Organization Anaphylaxis Guideline, the term \u2018hypersensitivity\u2019 refers to reproducible symptoms occurring as the result of exposure to a defined stimulus; \u2018allergy\u2019 is defined as an HSR initiated by a specific immunological mechanism; and \u2018anaphylaxis\u2019 is classified as a severe, life-threatening, generalized or systemic HSR5. The European Society for Medical Oncology divides the reactions into anaphylactic and anaphylactoid, and proposes the term \u2018non-allergic anaphylaxis\u2019 instead of \u2018anaphylactoid\u2019 where there is a \u2018non-immunological cause\u20196. The European Network for Drug Allergy\u2019s definition is independent of the underlying immunological mechanism and categorizes the HSRs as immediate and non-immediate. Moreover, differences between European and American physicians exist in managing these reactions7. The National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events distinguishes between allergy, anaphylaxis and cytokine release syndrome (CRS) based on clinical manifestations8. The more commonly known Gell and Coombs classification is based on the underlying immunological mechanism and the time to manifestation, and includes four types: immediate/type I (developing within 15\u201330 minutes of exposure), type II (minutes to hours) and type III (3\u20138 hours); and delayed/type IV (48\u201372 hours)9.",

            "text": "Although many immune-mediated adverse effects exist, here we focus on IRs. These reactions are unintended and occur at therapeutic doses of various products4, including biological products (such as recombinant proteins and antibodies)10,11, therapeutic nucleic acids, low-molecular-weight drugs1,12, and complex nanotechnology-based formulations13\u201315 herein referred to as nanomedicines (Tables 1 and 2). Despite the difference in underlying mechanisms, IRs may have overlapping clinical manifestations. Patients with acute IRs experience various symptoms including, but not limited to, skin flushing or rash, chest and back pain, dyspnoea, wheezing, chills, fever and rigor (Tables 1 and 2). These adverse effects require timely and accurate assessment, and proper management to avoid severe and potentially fatal consequences. Severe IRs are rare and occur in less than 5% of patients4. The incidence may increase, however, when different drugs are used in combination (for example paclitaxel and carboplatin), when patients have a certain type of human leukocyte antigens (HLA; for example HLA-B*57:01 and abacavir) or when there is an underlying viral infection (for example Epstein\u2013Barr virus infection and penicillin)6,13. Despite decades of research suggesting that the incidence of IRs depends on both pharmacodynamics and pharmacogenetics, it is largely unknown why some patients develop these reactions while others do not. The lack of uniform terminology and classification of the reactions further complicates the issue. As such, acute IRs cause substantial stress among patients and their families as well as care providers and regulatory agencies16. Several world-leading health authorities (the World Health Organization, the United States Food and Drug Administration17 and the European Medicines Agency) agree on the noxious nature of these adverse effects and the need for improved prevention and management6. These improvements largely depend on an understanding of mechanisms, but the molecular and cellular processes causing IRs are incompletely understood. Therefore, IRs in patients are currently managed by systemic administration of immunosuppressive, anti-pyretic and anti-inflammatory medications before the infusion, during administration or both1,4,6.",

Type II HSR is cytotoxic hypersensitivity mediated by drug-specific antibodies (mainly IgG), the complement system and natural killer cells. Symptoms include pemphigus, nephritis, autoimmune haemolytic anaemia and Goodpasture\u2019s syndrome9,13. Type III HSRs are mediated by the immune complexes formed between a drug and an antibody (either IgM or IgG), and they involve complement activation. Clinical manifestations are serum sickness, fever, glomerulonephritis and vasculitis9,13. Type IV HSRs are mediated by T-helper cells and macrophages and manifest as erythema, induration, contact dermatitis, maculopapular rash and granuloma9,13.

            "text": "Type I\u2013III reactions and CARPA are commonly recognized mechanisms associated with drug-mediated HSRs. Platinum-based formulations are notorious for type I HSRs4,6, while CARPA is the best-studied reaction to nanomaterials18,19. CARPA has been described for liposomal drugs (Doxil and Ambisome), micelles (Taxol and Taxotere) and modified dextran-coated iron oxides (Feraheme), all of which are approved for clinical use and are marketed with a black box warning of potentially life-threatening IRs. Properties of nanomaterials commonly associated with CARPA are summarized in Fig. 1a. Uncontrolled release of cytokines resulting from excessive proinflammatory stimuli, inadequate regulation of inflammation or a combination thereof is responsible for severe CRS. The clinical manifestations of CRS include erythematous or pruritic rash, hypotension, fever, malaise, tachycardia, tachypnoea, generalized swelling, altered mental status, diffuse lymphadenopathy, and enlargement of the liver and spleen20. CRS created translation barriers for immunotherapies (for example CAR-T cells), biologics (for example TGN1412) and nanotechnology-formulated therapeutic nucleic acids (for example MRX34)10,21\u201323. The consequences were severe and, in some cases, fatal23. It is important to mention that in some cases (CAR-T therapy, for example), clinical CRS manifestations are not immediate and may take a week or more, which further complicates IR definition, diagnosis and intervention. Moreover, some infections (such as influenza virus and bacteraemia) may trigger cytokine release with symptoms indistinguishable from the drug-mediated CRS24. Although various nanoformulations can induce the release of cytokines both in vitro and in vivo25, the relevance of this mechanism to various types of nanomedicine-triggered IRs remains largely unknown.",

            "text": "The IRs to drugs are often heterogeneous and involve overlapping reactions and effector cells. For example, activation of the complement system, which occurs in CARPA, is also involved in the pathogenesis of type II and type III HSRs. Conversely, the macrophages may contribute both to type IV HSRs and to CARPA. Cytokines that are produced by leukocytes are involved in CRS and can contribute to various types of HSRs, including pseudo-allergy. An excellent demonstration of the complexity of frequently overlapping mechanisms that cause IRs to nanomedicines comes from the experiences with liposomes and lipid-based nanocarriers, which, according to a recent report by the US Food and Drug Administration, dominate the current landscape of nanomedicine26. Research groups worldwide have reported that lipid-based carriers are not immunologically inert25,27,28. Preferential clearance of these materials by macrophages, activation of proinflammatory cytokines and the complement system are well-established25,27,28. However, the cause\u2013effect relationship between the complement activation, cell uptake and cytokine release is far from being understood. Despite the general acceptance that IRs involve multiple cellular and biochemical processes, the controversy over the leading cause of this toxicity creates considerable hurdles and delays in the development of a unified strategy for predicting and overcoming the IRs to nanomedicines.",

            "text": "Activation of pulmonary intravascular macrophages (PIMs) by PEGylated liposomes (where PEG is polyethylene glycol) was suggested as a key effector arm of CARPA in pigs29. The proposed double-hit scenario in this mechanism implies that both the complement and macrophage activation trigger the IRs symptoms29. Recently, a study of polystyrene beads in the same model concluded that PIMs activation is the leading cause of HSRs to nanomaterials and challenged the role of the complement30. This mechanism caused robust debate31,32. On the one hand, there is ample evidence that the pig model is sensitive to the detection of nanomedicine-induced CARPA32,33. On the other hand, PIMs are not present in the lungs of humans and animals commonly used in preclinical research (mice, rats, dogs and non-human primates)34\u201336. In these animal species, the liver- and spleen-resident macrophages are primarily responsible for nanoparticle clearance. PIMs are induced in humans under certain pathological conditions, such as liver failure34,35. In contrast, PIMs are common in the lungs of pigs, sheep and horses, not broadly recognized as preclinical models34,35. Therefore, one area that requires close attention is the understanding of whether liver- and spleen-resident macrophages in humans play the same role as PIMs in pigs during IRs to nanomedicines. The hypothesis that hepatopulmonary macrophage migration triggers cardiorespiratory symptoms in humans exposed to nanomedicines37 is attractive but requires verification. The pivotal role of PIMs in nanoparticle-mediated IRs in the porcine model will benefit from confirmation by various research groups and with various types of nanomaterials. For example, a recent study demonstrated that during the infusion reaction triggered in pigs by carboxylated, hydrophobic, highly anionic polystyrene nanoparticles, complement activation-related opsonization coincided with the peak of pulmonary distress38. The relative contribution of the complement and PIMs, as well as the cause\u2013effect relationship, may vary between different types of nanoparticles. Therefore, studies with clinically relevant well-characterized nanomedicines (for example liposomes, micelles, iron-oxides) are essential, while research-grade nanomaterials with poorly understood physicochemical properties (such as polystyrene beads) may not provide clinically relevant answers unless these particles are thoroughly characterized. The nature of a condition (cancer versus inflammatory disorder, for example) treated with a nanodrug should also be considered when analysing the mechanism of IRs to the nanomedicine. Other recently proposed mechanisms, such as those involving platelets as an effector arm39,40, should also be fully investigated in the context of nanoparticle physicochemical properties and interaction with other mechanisms.",

A recent approach proposed for therapeutic antibody-mediated IRs based on the long usage of these products in the clinic could serve as a starting point for nanomedicines44. In this approach, clinical symptoms of IRs12, also called Sampson criteria44, are reviewed first to diagnose anaphylaxis44. Next, the assessment of drug-specific IgEs (a skin test and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, ELISA) and markers of mast cell degranulation (histamine and tryptase) are used to verify the anaphylactic nature of the reaction. Additionally, cytokines (for example interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-8, interferon \u03b3, tumour necrosis factor \u03b1, IL-2 and IL-10), complement split products (C3a, C5a, sC5b-9), and complement consumption (for example CH50) are used to verify IgE-independent pathogenesis of IRs44. Re-challenge or avoidance of the allergen is finally used to confirm the IR44. Because anaphylactoid reactions to proteins may also increase the levels of tryptase and cytokines, these biomarkers are debated as suboptimal for diagnosing anaphylaxis to protein-based therapeutics18.",

In pigs, thromboxane A2 is recognized as the main mediator of pulmonary symptoms commonly seen during IRs.

Although IgG and IgM have been implicated in type II and type III HSRs to proteins and low-molecular-weight drugs41, no data exist about such responses to nanomedicines. However, several studies described naturally existing IgM and IgG that can bind to various components commonly present in nanomedicines (cholesterol, phospholipids and PEG)45,46. The accelerated blood clearance of PEGylated liposomes due to the anti-PEG IgM was reported in animals47.

To verify their relevance to humans, one must compare the underlying mechanism(s) between these models and patients. Although several mechanisms of IRs have been proposed for nanomedicines, CARPA is the most well-studied and understood32. The relevance of other mechanisms to nanomedicines remains unclear, given the current lack of human data. This work, therefore, is critical and interdependent on biomarker selection.",

For example, a clinically approved C5 inhibitory antibody, eculizumab (Soliris); a plasma-derived C1 inhibitor (C1INH); and a small-molecule inhibitor of factor D could be used to understand the contribution of the complement in humans54. Because it is not yet known what inhibitor would work best for preventing nanoparticle-induced complement activation in patients, non-clinical-grade inhibitors of C3 convertase (compstatin, APT070 or APL-2), soluble complement receptors (sCD35) and decay accelerating factor (CD55), chimeric receptors (CAB-2) or their animal counterparts could be investigated in the animal models. For example, sCD35 was effective at inhibiting liposome-triggered IRs in the pig model of CARPA55.",

For example, indomethacin efficiently blocked liposome-mediated IRs in pigs, suggesting cooperation between macrophage- and complement-mediated mechanisms55. Special consideration should be given to the type of the nanomedicine tested (for example PEGylated liposome or dextran-coated iron oxides), and the category of human subjects enrolled in the clinical trial. For example, the consequences of administering a complement inhibitor to cancer patients prescribed with Doxil are uncertain because the implications of complement in tumour growth are poorly understood. Likewise, inhibiting complement in patients with chronic kidney disease who had been prescribed Feraheme may increase the risk of infections because the immune system in these patients is already weakened, and complement-mediated protection from pathogens is further reduced by the inhibitor. The administration of empty carriers in combination with complement inhibitors can be much less dangerous and more ethically justified in healthy volunteers.",
