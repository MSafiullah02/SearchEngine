As a follow-up to an in vitro study on the effect of oral antiseptics on Herpes simplex virus, Type 1, this study was undertaken to evaluate the in vivo effect of an essential oil containing oral antiseptic on the reduction of viral titer in saliva during active viral infection. Method: Patients were recruited and evaluated in a single visit protocol at the onset of a perioral outbreak, consistent historically and clinically with recurrent Herpes labialis. Direct immunofluorescence of cytological smears of the lesions/oral fluids was used to confirm Herpes simplex virus types I or II. Patients were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: (1) active ingredient and (2) sterile water control. The viral lesion was evaluated as to clinical stage according to standard protocol. Salivary fluid samples were taken: (1) at baseline; (2) immediately following a 30 s rinse; (3) 30 min. after the 30 s rinse; and (4) on the repeat trial, also at 60 min. after the 30 s rinse.

This project was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of Listerine s Antiseptic (LA, Morris Plains, NJ, USA) mouthrinse versus a sterile water control in the reduction of infectious viral levels in saliva during an active viral infection. The human Herpes simplex virus (HSV-1 or -2) was selected as the test virus in order to establish a model for showing reduction of infectious virions in saliva following a 30 s rinse as recommended by the manufacturer with an antiseptic mouthrinse containing essential oils. It is well established that viral shedding and hence recovery occurs at variable levels in human saliva from the prodromal period through at least the full vesicular stages of recurrent herpetic outbreaks (Arvin & Prober 1999) . This is primarily because of variations in clinical protocol in determining the stage of the lesion and in recovery techniques, which have not been standardized in every study. In previous work in our laboratories, five stages of clinical variation have been defined, see Table 1 . Other researchers have determined that early recurrent Herpes labialis lesions (Stage 1 and 2 in our clinical evaluation) represent the time when the greatest viral shedding will likely be occurring (Arvin & Prober 1999) . Since Stage 3 is a variable period with some new vesicle formation potentially still occurring, the degree to which infectious virions can be recov-ered from saliva or from lesions themselves is also variable.
