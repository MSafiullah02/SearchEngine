Several laboratory studies proposed vaccine candidates, based on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike (S) antigen, which induce neutralizing antibodies. These antibodies inhibit RBD from binding the host receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4; also known as CD26) [4], An alternative strategy is to use virus-specific therapeutic human antibodies that can be rapidly developed to neutralize the virus during infection. Indeed, some monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) cloned from humans using various platforms have shown considerable MERS-CoV-neutralizing potency along with therapeutic or prophylactic efficacies in animal models [5\u201312]. Additionally, nanobodies and camel/human hybrid antibodies have been suggested for treatment of viral infection [13, 14]. Most recently, a research group isolated mAbs from a MERS patient via B cell immortalization, which showed promising therapeutic and prophylactic potential against MERS-CoV infection in a mouse model [8]. Moreover, targeting multiple antigenic sites on spike might be advantageous, suggesting the possibility of combination therapy with RBD-specific antibodies for escape-mutant prevention [11, 15]. To date, two phase I human clinical trials of therapeutic antibody candidates, humanized mAbs (REGN3048, REGN3051) and human polyclonal anti-MERS immunoglobulin G (IgG; SAB-301) from transchromosomic cattle have been completed [16, 17]. The clinical trial result of SAB-301 shows that SAB-301 appears to be safe and well-tolerated in healthy individuals, encouraging expectations for the development of MERS therapeutics [16].",

Several strategies are available for the development of therapeutic human mAbs for viral infections; in the present study, we isolated single B cells from patients for development. A MERS-CoV S antigen trimer probe (S-2P) was designed to retain betacoronavirus S proteins in the prefusion conformation [20]. It increased antigenicity and affinity binding to hDPP4. It also elicited high titers of neutralizing antibodies in mice. Previous reports, including MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, HIV and RSV, showed that structure-designed stabilization of the viral surface protein by mutations induced greater neutralizing mAbs than postfusion proteins [20\u201323].Thus, we rationally designed a strategy to develop the potent neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV infection by using an S-2P. We directly isolated B cells from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of convalescent patients using an S-2P for cell sorting, cloned the IgG genes, and produced antibodies through cell culture [15]. We also evaluated the binding affinity for S protein and the RBD of the obtained mAbs and determined the neutralizing ability with a pseudovirus and plaque- reduction neutralizing assay (PRNT) in vitro. Finally, we examined the therapeutic efficacy of the mAb with the strongest neutralizing activity in transgenic (TG) mice challenged with a lethal dose of MERS-CoV. These results offer a new platform and antibody for prompt development toward clinical trials.",

The other five antibodies (KNIH90-A3, KNIH90-A9, KNIH90-B2, KNIH90-B7, and KNIH90-C4) bound to the S-2P trimer and S1 but not RBD; however, we identified no S2 domain-specific antibody, as this domain has relatively low immunogenicity as compared with the variable S1 domain. Only KNIH90-C4 bound to prefusion S trimer more strongly than S1 protein in ELISA (Fig 1B). Also, the specificity of mAbs were tested in immunofluorescence assay (IFA) with other coronaviruses, human coronavirus (HCoV)-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and SARS-CoV-2. All mAbs were specific for MERS-CoV. All mAbs showed no indication of binding to other coronavirus strains tested (S3 Fig).",

Among the 11 purified mAbs, the five S1 (non-RBD)-specific mAbs failed to inhibit pseudovirus particles, but five of the six RBD-specific mAbs showed high neutralization capacity, with KNIH90-E6 failing to reach 50% inhibition, even at the highest mAb concentration tested (Fig 2A). The IC50 values for the RBD-specific mAbs varied between 0.2173 \u03bcg/ml and 0.0089 \u03bcg/ml, with KNIH90-F1 demonstrating the most potent inhibition (Table 1, S1 Fig). Similar results were obtained in the PRNT assay using wild-type MERS-CoV (EMC) virus (Fig 2B). Therefore, we identified KNIH90-F1 as the most potent RBD-specific mAb against MERS-CoV (EMC and KNIH-002) in both the pseudovirus neutralization assay (IC50: 0.0135 \u03bcg/ml) and PRNT assay (IC50: 0.006 \u03bcg/ml) (Table 1, S1 Fig). However, in contrast to the pseudovirus neutralization assay, some S1-specific (non-RBD) mAbs (KNIH90-B2 and KNIH90-B7) also moderately inhibited the wild-type virus, although to a lesser extent than the RBD-specific mAbs (Fig 2B). Spike of the KNIH-002 strain has four amino acid changes (S137R, I529T, V530L, and R629H), compared to EMC strain [34]. Among them, I529T and V530L mutations were located in the RBD, but not at the RBD-DPP4 receptor interface [35]. Thus, we assumed that KNIH90-F1 would have similar neutralizing activities and affinities between MERS-CoV KNIH-002 strain and EMC strain. As we expected, this antibody showed potent neutralizing activity against both MERS-EMC and KNIH-002 strains.",

The RBD comprises seven \u03b1-helices (residues 385\u20139, 411\u20135, 430\u20135, 453\u20135, 463\u20138, 525\u20139, and 547\u20139) and 11 \u03b2-strands (residues 400\u20134, 407\u20139, 419\u201326, 438\u201347, 477\u201383, 497\u2013507, 513\u20135, 538\u201344, 553\u201361, 568\u201376, and 583\u20136). The variable-region structure model of KNIH90-F1 was generated from residues 20 to 149 of the heavy chain and residues 20 to 129 of the light chain. A 14-amino acid peptide sequence of the complementarity determining region H3 loop for KNIH90-F1 was predicted at position 124SYGSGSYYTHYYAM137 of the heavy chain (Fig 3A). Modeled structures were used as the starting structures for docking simulation. According to the SnugDock protocol, these two structures were located very close to each other but did not superpose. Determination of the RBD interaction with KNIH90-F1 was performed by the SnugDock algorithm based on computational modeling of KNIH90-F1 and RBD protein sequences (Fig 3B). SnugDock alignment indicated that the RBD N-terminus couples to the KNIH90-F1 variable region through four RBD-interfacing peptide sequences: 528SI529, 538GDYYRKQ544, 544QLSPL548, and 551GGW553. Another three individual amino acid sites (S508, D510, and W553) of the MERS-RBD molecule also aligned closely with the KNIH90-F1 variable region (Fig 3C). The RBD residues (510D, 538GDY540, and 553W) attached to the KNIH90-F1 antibody are the same sites that interact with DPP4 [35]. The several residues (508S, 510D, 538G, 543KQLS546, 548L, 551GG552) of binding interface in KNIH90-F1 mAb were expected as novel binding resides in comparison with those of other MERS-CoV antibodies [10, 36, 37]. Five of the simulated binding-interface residues (510D, 539D, 540Y, 542R, and 553W) showed strong hindrance of RBD\u2013hDPP4-receptor binding in the mAb m336 study [12]. These results indicated that KNIH90-F1 was capable of neutralizing MERS-CoV entry by preventing RBD attachment to DPP4.",

The previous report elucidated that the mice infected with MERS-CoV had shown the pathological changes, gross pathological changes, mononuclear cell infiltration and alveolar edema on day 4 and day 7 post-infection [13], we performed euthanasia on day 4 and 7 to analyze the therapeutic or prophylactic effect of mAbs. Histopathological changes, such as inflammatory cell infiltration, neurogenic necrosis, and perivascular inflammatory cell infiltration, were observed in lung and brain tissues of the untreated group, as described previously [13].

Since then, the importance of patient management, especially in hospitals, and preparedness against newly emerging infectious diseases has been emphasized from a public health perspective. Due to the absence of approved vaccines and virus-specific antiviral agents, an alternative antiviral-treatment guideline for MERS-CoV patients involving the triple administration of type I interferon, ribavirin, and lopinavir/ritonavir for 10 to 14 days was recommended in South Korea [38]. However, side effects of this triple administration and significantly low therapeutic efficacy of ribavirin and interferon for severe MERS cases have been reported [39\u201342]. Therefore, a virus-specific neutralizing antibody regimen could be proposed as an alternative treatment.",

Previous reports, including MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, HIV and RSV, showed that structure-designed stabilization of the viral surface protein by mutations or multivalent display induced greater neutralizing mAbs than postfusion proteins [20\u201323]. Accordingly, we reasoned that the prefusion S-2P probe could bind greater neutralizing antibodies on the surface of single B cells than wild S protein. Considering the duration from the isolation of single B cells to the purification of IgGs, we obtained total 11 mAbs rapidly within one month by using this antibody technology. All these mAbs had high specificity, bound to only the cells infected with MERS-CoV, not other coronaviruses in the IFA experiment.",

            "text": "Among the six RBD-specific mAbs obtained, the most potent neutralizing antibody was KNIH90-F1, which showed exceptional therapeutic efficacy in the mouse model. In line with other studies, the RBD-specific antibodies showed high neutralizing activity, whereas the IC50 values from the live-virus-based assay varied widely [6\u201310, 12, 43]. It is speculated that RBD-specific mAbs, such as LCA60 (IC50 = 0.110\u20130.279 \u03bcg/ml), MERS-GD27 (IC50 = 0.001 \u03bcg/ml) and KNIH90-F1 (IC50 = 0.006 \u03bcg/ml), generated directly from patient B cells repertoires are more potent and are thus more likely to neutralize wild-type viruses. However, among the S1 (non-RBD) mAbs, only KNIH90-B2 and KNIH90-B7 showed mild neutralizing ability against the live virus (failed to reach the IC50 value). The N-terminal domain (NTD) of S1 binds sialic acid of host cellular receptors [44], and non-RBD mAbs targeting the NTD of S1 also show neutralizing activity [5]. We assumed that KNIH90-B2 and KNIH90-B7 could bind to NTD of S1, resulting the mild neutralization via preventing the viral attachment to the sialic acid of cellular receptors. However, no S2-specific antibody was isolated from patient PBMCs in the present study. This might be attributed to the lower immunogenicity of the S2 than the S1 domain, as is the case for the influenza virus HA2 stalk domain [45]. The practical use of antibody cocktails has been used for Ebola virus [46, 47], hepatitis C virus [48], and MERS-CoV [17] to prevent the emergence of escape mutants as well as enhance the neutralization breadth. We suggest that combining RBD mAbs and non-RBD mAbs, targeting multiple antigenic sites on MERS-CoV spike, need to be implemented for treating future MERS-CoV infection.",

Additionally, the residual live-virus particles were not detected in the lungs by 4-days post-infection in both the therapeutic and prophylactic administration groups. Even with a significant amount of viral genome in the lungs, MERS-CoV infection rarely occurred through plaque assays. It was estimated that the KNIH90-F1 mAb administered to the animal model remained in the tissues or attached to the virus and neutralized its infectivity. Although there is substantial heterogeneity in drug disposition and pharmacokinetics of mAbs, the half-life of mAbs is generally 14 days (7\u201321 days) [49]. We sacrificed the mice administered with KNIH90-F1 mAb on the post-infection four days. Therefore, we assumed that a sufficient amount of mAb in the lungs could block the remained MERS-CoV infection in plaque assays.",

First, escape mutants are more likely to occur when cultured viruses are continuously exposed to RBD-specific antibodies [10, 15]. Because KNIH90-F1 recognizes similar RBD domains, the efficacy of combined therapy with non-RBD S1 antibodies or RBD antibodies targeting different epitopes on the RBD should be evaluated to reduce the potential for escape mutations. In addition to direct receptor inhibition, indirect Fc-receptor-mediated immune responses, such as antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity, should also be investigated. Second, due to the limited availability of TG mice, survival analysis following prophylactic administration was not completed. Only a pathogenic study that included measurements of viral titers in lung and brain tissues and histopathology were conducted. Therefore, additional animal experiments should be performed to assess complete prophylactic efficacy. Third, computer-assisted structural docking modeling suggested that the putative interacting residues on RBD are similar to those published previously [5, 8, 12]; however, more precise epitope mapping, such as that utilizing X-ray crystallography or RBD point-mutation analysis, is needed to resolve the exact epitope structure.",
