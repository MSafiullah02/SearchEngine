The RNAs were produced by in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase from the two PCR-amplified cDNAs containing the respective regions. The PCR was performed using the complete NV cDNA as template. The sense primer used in the PCR contained the bacteriophage T7 promoter sequence, while the antisense poly(A) primer was used for the addition of the 24 A to the 3\u2032UTR PCR product. The PCR was performed for 35 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 1 min, 42 \u00b0C for 1 min, and 75 \u00b0C for 30 s, using a Perkin\u2013Elmer Cetus DNA thermocycler. The resulting PCR products were purified by a QIAquiq gel extraction G-50 kit (Qiagen) before they were used as templates for RNA synthesis. After transcription reaction, the DNA template was removed by treating the samples with DNase RQ1 (Promega). Unincorporated nucleotides in the reaction mixture were removed by gel filtration.

A 10-fold molar excess of the unlabeled homologous 3\u2032UTR strongly reduced complexes I and II formation, while a 20-fold molar excess of the same competitor completely inhibited complex II formation. However, a 20-fold molar excess of unlabeled non-related heterologous RNA transcript was an inefficient competitor (Fig. 2D, lane 4).

Two main complexes, with similar migration patterns to the ones observed with the 3\u2032UTR, were detected (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 2, respectively). The complexes formed with both RNAs could be different since the poly(A) tail is a target for the binding of cellular proteins; however, RNP complexes were treated with RNAses, thus neither the poly(A) tail nor the complex formed with it, which were not labeled with [\u03b1-32P]UTP, can be detected by autoradiography. To visualize the complexes formed with the poly(A) tail, [\u03b1-32P]ATP was used to label both 3\u2032RNAs. Under these conditions, we could detect differences in the complex formation with both RNAs. The 3\u2032UTR and the 3\u2032UTR(A) were able to form five complexes (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 2, respectively); complexes I, III, and V formed with the 3\u2032UTR(A) had a similar migration pattern to complexes II, III, and V formed with the 3\u2032UTR, respectively (Fig. 3B, lanes 2 and 3, respectively). However, complex II formed with the 3\u2032UTR(A), which together with complex V are the most prominent complexes formed with this RNA, did not correspond to any complex formed with the 3\u2032UTR. Complexes III and IV were not consistently discernible in subsequent experiments. Complexes formed with the 3\u2032UTR were overexposed with respect to those formed with the 3\u2032UTR(A). These results suggest that the poly(A) tail may influence the formation of the RNA\u2013protein complexes either because it changes the size and conformation of the RNA and/or because it interacts with some other proteins present in the S10 HeLa cell extract.",

Moreover, the amount of radioactivity present in complex II was higher than the amount present in complex II formed without competitor RNAs (Fig. 4A, lanes 4 and 1, respectively). These results suggest that complex II contains proteins, which bind specifically to the poly(A) tail.

It has been reported that PABP can bind to the PV 3\u2032UTR with a poly(A) tail containing a minimum of eight nts and that its affinity increases as the poly(A) tail lengthens [12]. The poly(A) tail present in the 3\u2032UTR(A) is 24 nt long, therefore more than one PABP molecule can bind to this sequence. The two complexes observed after the RNAse could contain different defined amounts of rPABP. The expression and purification of the rPABP is described by Herold and Andino [12].",

Next, UV-cross-linking experiments were performed in an attempt to identify some of them. Ten proteins from HeLa cell extract, with apparent molecular masses of 110, 97, 85, 75, 68, 60, 52, 50, 39, and 33 kDa, bound to both RNAs (Fig. 5A\n, lanes 2 and 3, respectively).

It was not possible to detect any differences in the proteins crosslinked to both RNAs; however, a higher amount of radioactivity was observed in the 68 kDa protein crosslinked to the 3\u2032UTR(A) (7%), compared to the same band crosslinked to the 3\u2032UTR RNA. The increased amount of radioactivity in the 68-kDa band, could correspond to the PABP that binds to the poly(A) tail. To examine this possibility, a 50-fold molar excess of the homologous and the heterologous RNAs was used. A strong competition of all the proteins was observed with both RNAs (Fig. 5B, lanes 4 and 3, respectively); however, the 68-kDa protein competed only with the homologous unlabeled RNA (Fig. 5B, lane 4). These results suggest that the presence of the poly(A) tail was responsible for the competition of an extra band of 68-kDa, which co-migrates with the 68 kDa band bound to the [\u03b1-32P] ATP labeled 3\u2032UTR(A) RNA. The molecular mass of this protein co-relates with the PABP molecular mass. No competition was observed when the non-related heterologous RNA was used (Fig. 5B, lane 5).",

Under this condition, we detected the formation of five complexes with both RNAs, some of them with the same migration patterns, but complex II, formed with the 3\u2032UTR(A), did not correspond to any complex formed with the 3\u2032UTR. Then complex II could be formed by the poly(A) tail bound to proteins present in HeLa cell extract. Since the poly(A) tract is the target site for the PABP interaction, competition experiments of complexes formed with [\u03b1-32P]ATP labeled 3\u2032UTR(A) were performed. We could demonstrate that complex II contains proteins that specifically bind to the poly(A) tail, since this complex was not completed with the 3\u2032UTR RNA. Moreover, the presence of the PABP in complex II was confirmed in mobility gel supershift assays using anti-PABP antibodies. In addition, an rPABP was also able to specifically bind to the 3\u2032UTR(A) RNA; but it did not bind to the 3\u2032UTR RNA. The two bands in the mobility shift assay can be explained due to the presence of the 24 nts long tail that could permit the formation of a RNP complex with more than one PABP molecule [12]. Then RNAse treatment could generate two different complexes containing different defined amounts of rPABP.",

However, no difference between both patterns at the usual electrophoretic migration of PABP (68\u201372 kDa) was found. Even so, the 68 kDa band that crosslinks with the NV3\u2032UTR(A) contains more that one protein, since the competition experiments using an excess of homologous RNA competed completely with this band; while the heterologous RNA, which does not contain the poly(A) tail, only competed partially, suggesting that the 68 kDa band contains at least one protein that specifically binds to the poly(A) tail sequence. Experiments to identify the 97 and the 68-kDa protein (other than the PAPB) are currently being performed.",
