            "text": "Four standard mathematical methods were used to estimate R; details on the derivation of the formulas used in these methods are available elsewhere (9\u201311). These methods have been applied to assess measles transmissibility in several countries (9, 11\u201315) and to calculate R for a variety of other diseases (10, 16\u201318). Method 1 estimates R as 1 \u2212 P, where P is the proportion of cases that were imported. This method calculates the total number of cases arising from an importation as a geometric progression of cases per generation based on R. Methods 2 and 3 use a subcritical branching process that models the spread of an infection for a given value of R, and from which the expected distribution of chain sizes and durations can be calculated. One can then fit these models to the observed distribution of sizes (in method 2) and generations of spread (in method 3). The last formal assessment of measles transmissibility in the United States was performed for preelimination years 1997\u20131999 using these methods (9). Because public health response (e.g., quarantining, vaccination of susceptibles) can mitigate measles transmission and limit the number of secondary infections after importations and the size and duration of outbreaks, R as measured by the first 3 methods may be a reflection of both baseline immunity and control measures. Thus, we used a fourth estimation approach (method 4), originally developed to track changes in disease transmissibility over time (10), to assess transmissibility early during outbreaks, when public health interventions are unlikely to be in place. Specifically, we estimated the average number of secondary cases infected by the index case (i.e., the reproduction number of the index case (Rindex)), defined as the case with the earliest date of symptom onset in each cluster (16). Method 4 utilizes a likelihood-based estimation procedure that probabilistically infers \u201cwho infected whom\u201d from the observed dates of symptom onset, based on the known distribution of the serial interval (10). The serial interval is the time from symptom onset in a primary case to symptom onset in a secondary case infected by that primary case (19); based on household studies, the serial interval for measles is best described by a gamma probability distribution, with a mean of 11.1 days and a standard deviation of 2.47 days (20).",

Rindex was estimated as the probability-weighted average over all transmission trees of the number of cases that were in the second generation. We assigned Rindex = 0 in single cases (16).

Reassuringly, Rindex point estimates exceeded 1 only once across the study years (in 2013), indicating low measles transmissibility even before public health responses to measles cases were initiated.

In addition, in 4 of the last 7 years, the upper confidence limit for Rindex exceeded 1. These changes in R and Rindex are a reflection of the increasing number of US-acquired measles cases relative to the number of importations, the increasing size and duration of outbreaks, and the increasing spread from index cases\u2014all of which point to a potentially concerning trend in measles transmissibility in the United States, which warrants close monitoring. Although vaccination coverage rates at the national level have remained high, these do not capture the variability in vaccination rates at the community level (25, 26). The fact that the majority (>70%) of measles cases occur among unvaccinated individuals suggests that failure to vaccinate, rather than failure of vaccine performance (e.g., waning immunity) or selective pressure on measles viruses, is what is driving measles transmission. Together with the increase in transmissibility seen in recent years, these findings may suggest growing clusters of undervaccination. Although these clusters are unlikely to provide the critical mass necessary for measles transmission to be sustained between epidemics without reintroductions (the critical community size for sustained measles transmission is 250,000\u2013400,000) (26, 27), as R approaches 1, larger and more sustained outbreaks will be increasingly common. Broader and more durable propagation of disease imposes a significant economic burden on local health institutions (28) and increases the risk of measles being spread to infants too young to be vaccinated or to persons for whom vaccination is not recommended for medical reasons, as well as the risk of measles-associated deaths.",

First, the methods we used assume homogeneity of susceptibility and mixing in the population, and a degree of heterogeneity between subpopulations clearly exists in the United States (e.g., in levels of nonvaccination, sizes of unvaccinated clusters, settings of transmission, degrees of mixing outside a subpopulation, and density). Heterogeneity can be assessed by comparing the observed and theoretical distributions of outbreak sizes (11, 15). The observed outbreak sizes in this study did not follow the predicted distribution as well as in a previous evaluation (Web Figure 1) (9), suggesting pockets rather than an even distribution of susceptibility. Thus, our estimates of R and Rindex likely reflect attributes of the affected populations and overestimate transmission in the general population. This indication of heterogeneity supports the notion of growing pools of susceptibility, and does not detract from the fact that importations of measles into these communities can result in transmission and outbreaks. Due to the contagiousness of measles, measles outbreaks uniquely expose the deficiencies in immunization programs. Efforts to further understand transmission heterogeneity could help pinpoint opportunities for improved control in groups with the greatest transmission potential.",

In particular, R might underestimate transmission if infection control measures were instituted promptly. However, because of the delay between onset of infectiousness in the index case and implementation of control measures, Rindex is expected to be less affected by outbreak response (16). Interestingly, we demonstrated overall low transmission during the early stage of outbreaks, which confirms good baseline population immunity. This finding also points to a window of opportunity, before measles takes hold, in which transmission can be halted if cases are detected and reported early. Further studies are needed to disentangle the relative contributions of baseline measles-mumps-rubella vaccine coverage and infection control measures in avoiding large outbreaks.",

Transmission could appear to be increasing due to an increase in the number of importations\u2014from a surge of measles in countries visited by US travelers, for example. However, because calculations of R and Rindex are based on proportions and distributions (and not on the absolute number of cases), these estimates would not be affected by an increase in importations. Stochastic effects, such as introductions occurring randomly into areas with larger pockets of susceptibility in more recent years, could also give the impression of increased transmissibility. In particular, because one large measles outbreak in a highly unvaccinated population accounted for approximately 60% of measles cases during 2014, we also measured R and Rindex for that year after excluding this outbreak; we obtained similar results, that is, higher estimates in 2014 compared with early postelimination years. If observed changes in R and Rindex are sustained in future years, these data will support increased susceptibility to measles in the United States.",

Nevertheless, an accumulation of unvaccinated individuals may have driven an increase in measles transmissibility in recent years, which warrants continued monitoring. Because measles is still common in many areas of the world, imported cases of measles and limited spread continue to occur. The key factor for ongoing success is maintenance of high levels of vaccination across the population and minimizing pools of susceptibility. As such, health-care professionals play an important role in educating parents about the safety and benefits of immunizations (31), and they should continue to encourage timely measles vaccination of all eligible patients (26). Vaccination policies that support high coverage and research on optimal vaccination practices (e.g., vaccination as the default option) (32) remain critical (33).
