Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) have been developed for classical as well as newly emerging respiratory viruses and have been shown to be more sensitive and time efficient than DFA or culture. However, testing for all respiratory viral targets using individual PCRs is expensive and laborious. A conventional multiplex RT-PCR would be a very useful tool in resource limited settings. Therefore, multiplex PCR methods were developed with the aim of detecting different viruses simultaneously [Coiras et al., 2004; Bellau-Pujol et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2009; Choudhary et al., 2013a] .",

The xTAG respiratory virus panel (RVP) fast assay (Luminex Molecular Diagnostics Inc., Toronto, Canada) is a CE marked commercially available kit based on suspension microarray technology and enables the detection of large number of viruses in a single reaction [Krunic et al., 2007; Merante et al., 2007] . RVP fast assay has a simple protocol and shorter turnaround time than the original RVP assay and detects 19 different viruses or subtypes: influenza A (subtype: H1, H3), influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus A (RSV-A), RSV-B, parainfluenza virus 1 (PIV-1), PIV-2, PIV-3, PIV-4, human metapneumovirus, coronaviruses 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, rhinovirus/enterovirus (RhV/EV), adenovirus, and human bocavirus. Recent studies show that the RVP assay is more sensitive and specific compared with culture and antigen detection [Wong et al., 2009; Gadsby et al., 2010] . However a major disadvantage of RVP fast assay is the cost of the kit and the instrument. In this study, we compared the performance of an in-house developed conventional multiplex RT-PCR, monoplex real time RT-PCR and xTAG RVP fast assay for the detection of multiple respiratory viruses and their subtypes in clinical specimens.",

If the MS2 or lambda controls failed in the RVP fast assay, the test was repeated to obtain a valid result. A one step single tube multiplex RT-PCR was performed according to the xTAG RVP fast assay product insert instructions. PCR amplification was performed on a GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City) using the following cycling parameters: 1 preheating step (cDNA synthesis) at 50\u02daC for 20 min, 1 denaturing cycle at 95\u02daC for 15 min, followed by 34 amplification cycles at 95\u02daC for 30 sec, 59\u02daC for 30 sec, and 72\u02daC for 30 sec, ending with 1 cycle at 72\u02daC for 2 min and a hold at 4\u02daC until ready for use. All reagents, the xTAG RVP fast bead mix, reporter buffer, the xTAG streptavidin and phycoerythrin (SA-PE) conjugate were vortexed before use.

            "text": "In this study, the performance of the in-house developed conventional multiplex RT-PCR, with monoplex real time RT-PCR and Luminex xTAG 1 RVP fast assay was assessed by the retrospective testing of 310 respiratory clinical samples originally submitted for the diagnosis of influenza A/ H1N1pdm09 virus. The overall sensitivity was 96.9%, 87.9%, and 68.3% for mRT-PCR, rtRT-PCR, and xTAG 1 RVP fast assay respectively. Since bocavirus and adenovirus were not tested by multiplex RT-PCR and real time RT-PCR hence excluded for sensitivity calculation for these tests. In this study, we found that the xTAG 1 RVP fast assay is less sensitive than mRT-PCR and rtRT-PCR. The overall RVP fast assay sensitivity was 78.8% reported by Gadsby et. al. [2010] , 77.5% for all the targets reported by Pabbaraju et. al. [2011] , 87.2% reported by Kim et. al. [2013] while 33% reported by Raymaekers et. al. [2011] . Pabbaraju et. al. [2008] reported RVP assay sensitivity and specificity as 91.2% and 99.7% respectively when their in-house NAATs were considered as a gold standard. In another study, RVP fast assay showed a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 91% when compared with culture, while MultiCode-PLx showed 89% and 87% and ResPlex II showed 89% and 94%, respectively [Balada-Llasat et al., 2011] . Popowitch et al. [2013] re-] reported sensitivity and specificity for xTAG RVP fast as 84.4% and 99.9% respectively. In the present study, a lower sensitivity of RVP fast assay was observed compared to that reported in other studies. This may be due to the fact that in this study we have compared the RVP fast assay against well standardized and robust molecular assays using clinical samples whereas most of the other studies have compared the RVP fast assay against cultures/ DFA using isolates. Another reason may be the sequence variation in the primer-probe binding regions between viruses circulating in India and other parts of the world.",

The RVP fast v2 assay performed well with Quality Control for Molecular Diagnostic (QCMD) samples which had Ct values lower than 30. However for samples with Ct values higher than 30, a considerable drop in sensitivity was observed. To remedy this, PCR cycles were increased by 3 cycles (extended amplification) to increase sensitivity.

            "text": "The RVP fast assay mainly failed to detect influenza A, B, RSV A, B, and PIV-3 viruses. Concordance between mRT-PCR and rtRT-PCR for influenza A/H1N1pdm09, influenza B, RSV A and B was 100%. Influenza A samples missed by RVP fast assay had MFI (Median Fluorescent Intensity) values ranging between 150 and 300. The cut off value to consider positive for influenza A target was 300 MFI. It was observed that the discordant results of the RVP negative samples were associated with relatively high Ct values (mean Ct in RT-PCR 34). The limitation of xTAG RVP fast assay was that it does not subtype influenza A into H1N1pdm09 and the kit was not upgraded since the emergence of H1N1pdm09. Upgrading of the xTAG RVP fast assay to accommodate the subtyping of influenza A into H1N1pdm09 virus might increase the diagnostic value of the kit. The lower sensitivity of influenza B was also reported by Pabbaraju et al. [2011] and suggested sequence variation in the hemagglutinin gene of Flu B in the primer binding region. Gharabaghi et. al. [2011] reported influenza B sensitivity 64.9% for RVP fast assay. The sensitivity of RVP fast assay for RSV-A, RSV-B, and PIV-3 was 13.3%, 47.3%, and 44.4% respectively. Gharabaghi et. al. [2011] reported RSV-A sensitivity 85.5% and RSV-B 98.3%. Similar reports were published by other groups [Gadsby et al., 2010; Rand et al., 2011; Kim et al., 2013; Popowitch et al., 2013] . Low sensitivity of RSV in RVP assay attributed to the high Ct value in real time RT-PCR and may be due to the genetic variation of the virus. Pabbaraju et. al. [2008] also observed that their discordant RSVs were of low titer as well. The lower sensitivity in RVP fast assay for PIV-3 was also reported [Gharabaghi et al., 2011; Babady et al., 2012] .",

RVP fast assay and mRT-PCR have combined rhinovirus and enterovirus targets, these viruses clubbed together as RhV/EV to perform sensitivity of the tests. Real time RT-PCR sensitivity for rhinovirus was 66.2%, mRT-PCR and RVP fast assay 87.2% respectively. The reduced sensitivity may be because both mRT-PCR and RVP fast assay detect rhinovirus and enterovirus while rtRT-PCR specifically detected only rhinovirus. Sensitivity of RhV/EV in RVP fast assay was reported 93% by Popowitch et al. [2013] , 89.6% by Gadsby et al., [2010] . A total 48 rhinovirus/enterovirus positive samples were sequenced, out of which 42 (87.5%) were confirmed as rhinovirus and six (12.5%) as enterovirus by sequencing. Similar findings were also reported by others [Pabbaraju et al., 2008; Gadsby et al., 2010] . A relatively lower number of specimens were positive for coronaviruses, parainfluenza and metapneumovirus in our sample set. Two coronavirus OC43 positive samples missed by mRT-PCR had Ct values of 33 and 35 in the rtRT-PCR. A significant limitation in the present study was the absence of influenza A (H3N2) to evaluate the kit performance for detection of it. Therefore, a larger number of positive specimens are required in order to fully assess the sensitivity of the RVP fast assay for all targets.",

Similar observation for workflow and cost were reported for RVP fast assay by Rand et al. [2011] and Babady et al. [2012] . Luminex xTAG RVP fast assay has the advantage of strict quality control and manufacturing practices which minimizes errors during testing of the samples. Luminex xTAG RVP assay is an open PCR system and post amplification products are manipulated (hybridization), increasing the risk of potential laboratory contamination [Kim et. al., 2013] . mRT-PCR has disadvantage because it requires the visual inspection of products in gel and have a potential for amplicon contamination. Real time RT-PCR offers decreased contamination risk. More technical skill is required to perform xTAG RVP fast assay and rtRT-PCR than mRT-PCR. Limitation of the present study was that we have not tested prospective samples.",
