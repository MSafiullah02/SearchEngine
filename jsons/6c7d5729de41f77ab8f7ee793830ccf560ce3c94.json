Lymphopenia (83 of 115 patients; 72.2%) frequently occurred and then normalized on day 4 (IQR: 3 to 6) after admission in the survivors, with lung lesion absorbed gradually on day 8 (IQR: 6 to10) after onset (33 of 57 patients; 57.9%). The real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays for SARS-CoV-2 were positive in 78 (78/108; 72.2%) patients, and a false-negative RT-PCR occurred in 15 (13.9%) patients. Hypoxemia occurred in 94 (94/117; 80.3%) patients, and supplemental oxygen was given in 88 (72.7%) patients, and mon-invasive or invasive ventilation in 20 (16.5%) cases. Corticosteroid use might link to death. The case fatality rates were 4.4% (one of 23 patients), 29.3% (12/41), 22.8% (13/57) or 45% (9/20) for patients with moderate, severe, critical illness or on ventilator. The length of hospital stay was 14 (IQR: 10 to 20) days, and selfcare ability worsened in 21 patients (21/66; 31.8%) cases. Patients over 60 years were most likely to have poorer outcomes, and increasing in age by one-year increased risk for death by 18% (CI: 1.04-1.32). : medRxiv preprint 2 Conclusions In management of patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, especially the elderly with hypertension, close monitoring and appropriate supportive treatment should be taken earlier and aggressively to prevent from developing severe or critical illness. Corticosteroid use might link to death. Repeated RT-PCR tests or novel detection methods for SARS-CoV-2 should be adopted to improve diagnostic efficiency. : medRxiv preprint 3",

            "text": "In late December 2019, a cluster of atypical pneumonia of unknown cause was initially noticed and reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. 1 On Jan 7, 2020, a bat SARS-like coronavirus strain was identified from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples in three local patients by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, and the whole genome was sequenced and shared with the WHO. 2 By far, the novel coronavirus had caused severe infections and global circulation in humans, 3 and known as a member of betacoronavirus of the subgenus Sarbecovirus, with at least 79.5% of genetic sequence with SARS-CoV and 96.2% of homology to the coronavirus strain BatCov RaTG13. 4 Then, this SARS-like coronavirus was named as SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee for Taxonomy of Virus (ICTV), and the related infection as COVID-19 by the WHO on Feb 11, 2020. 5 6 The COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan could be traced back to Dec 1, 2019, 7 while a local resident was documented with respiratory symptoms and then confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, though any epidemical link was not found between the patient and other cases. From then on, the epidemic had rapidly grown, with a reported number of 41 suspected cases in Wuhan on Jan 3, 2020, 8 and then 1284 confirmed cases on Jan 24, 2020, the Eve of Chinese Lunar New Year. Thereafter, the curve of reported case was peaked and flattened on Feb 18, 2020 or so, with a total of 50, 633 confirmed cases in Wuhan and Hubei Province, 7, 253 from the other 30 provinces and regions, China. Meanwhile, 871 exported cases were reported from 25 countries across the world, a precursor of global pandemic. 8 9 The figure reported was just the tip of an iceberg, victims might be far beyond the known. 9 On Jan 23, 2020, traffic suspension was announced by Wuhan authorities, with community containment, to reduce movement of people and block virus transmission. As of Feb 28, 2020, forty-five designated and 12 temporary hospitals with more than 50,000 beds in Wuhan were urgently reconstructed, and more than 42,000 healthcare workers deployed across other areas of China, in response to the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Since Jan 26, 2020, as one of the firstly arrived medical assistance teams in Wuhan, we had been working at a COVID-19 ward in Hankou Hospital, one of the three firstly designated COVID-19 hospitals on Jan 3, 2020. Herein, given that the case fatality rates and death risk factors were not fully known for patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in the prodromal stage of the epidemic, and the knowledge pertaining to the progression of the disease was limited in the published cohort studies, 7 10-14 we reported a cases series with SARS-CoV-2 associated pneumonia, most of whom were severely and critically ill and treated in our COVID-19 ward, to describe the natural process of the disease and risk factors for critical illness or death.",

To our patients, negative RT-PCR could not completely rule out SARS-CoV-2 related pneumonia. 23 24 Firstly, RT-PCR testing was not available for our patients until in the late stage of the epidemic, and patients admitted before that time might be misdiagnosed. In 14 additional patients who were treated contemporarily in our ward and remained negative RT-PCR, serum IgM or IgG antibody specific for SARS-CoV-2 was tested positive in 12 (85.7%) cases on day 28 (interquartile range 10-40) after admission, meaning that they might have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 within weeks. Secondly, false-negative RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 had been reported. 23 24 Xu and co-workers reported that false-negative RT-PCR occurred in 691 (52.2%) of 1,324 outpatients with COVID-19 infection in their first test. 23 Xie and investigators reported five patients who had typical clinical and radiological manifestations but initial RT-PCR negative, retesting was positive 2-7 days after the first chest CT scan. 24 The authors argued that a chest CT image might be more sensitive to the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 related pneumonia. Our data showed that 15 patients (11.6%) whose initial RT-PCR were negative, retesting was positive during their hospital stay. Reasons for false-negative RT-PCR might be attributed to the sensitivity of the diagnostic test kits, inappropriate sampling and insufficient viral load of the specimens. Repeated tests or newly developed detection methods should be adopted to improve diagnostic efficiency. 24 Thirdly, our data shown that the time window of RT-PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 was 19 (interquartile range 14-34) days from illness onset, the viral load on nasal and throat swabs would be too trace to be detected after 18 days from onset. 25 Finally, all of our patients presented very similar epidemiological, clinical and radiographic features, and other probable causative agents was excluded, except 9 (7.8%) of 116 cases who shown weakly positive of serum IgM antibodies for influenza A or B, chlamydia or mycoplasma pneumoniae and mumps virus.

The treatment for our patients was largely supportive, except a few received Ribavirin or Chloroquine, while absorption of the lesions on chest CT images could be observed in 57.9% of patients on day 8 after onset, along with a remarkable increase in lymphocyte count in the survivors. Pan and coworkers reported 21 cases with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, the greatest lung involvement was achieved on day 10 after symptom onset, and the lesions gradually absorbed after 2 weeks. 26 Of note, an obvious discrepancy between symptom and the degree of hypoxemia was found in a considerable number of our patients, 94 of 117 patients (80.3%) had a PaO 2 /FiO 2 of less than 300 mm Hg on admission, but they did not present obvious dyspnea or tachycardia at rest, and the extent of lung involvement on their chest CT image was not always consistent with the degree of hypoxemia.

It was crucial to maintain the pulse oxygen saturation at an acceptable level through aggressive oxygen support, e.g., \u2265 93%, thus to prevent patients from developing severe respiratory distress. 27 If the patients could get through the acute phase of the illness, they were more likely to recover. Besides, Li and co-authors presumed that SARS-CoV-2 might have potential neuroinvasion by transsynaptic transfer, and be partially related to the aggravation of respiratory failure in the COVID-19 patients. Early use of inhaled antiviral agents might be useful to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 replication in the respiratory tracts and lung, and to prevent from its subsequent neuroinvasion. 31 Mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal life support seemed less effective on patients with refractory hypoxemic respiratory failure. In our study, invasive or noninvasive ventilation was adopted in 20 critically ill patients, nine (45%) of them died in 12 days. Zhou and colleagues analyzed retrospectively 191 cases with a median age of 56 years old, twenty-six patients had received non-invasive ventilation and thirty-two invasive ventilation, but fifty-five (94.8%) of whom died. ECMO therapy was used for three cases but all died. 33 Huang and co-investigators reported 41 cases who were confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and admitted in the earliest stage of the outbreak, invasive or non-invasive ventilation was required in ten of 13 critically ill patients, five (39%) of them died. 7 Although the case fatality rate of critically ill patient was lower than ours, their patients were younger, with a median age of 49 (interquartile range 41-58) years vs 59 (interquartile range 46-67) years, respectively. As of the final date of follow-up, seven cases were still hospitalized, and the case fatality rate was expected to increase. Yang and co-workers reported 52 critically ill cases, with an average age of 59.7 years old. 11 Mechanical ventilation was instituted in 37 cases, and 30 (81%) of whom died in 28 days. ECMO therapy was given in 6 patients, five of them died and one still on the machine as of day 28. The authors explained that the case fatality rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection was likely to be higher in critically ill patients than those of SARS (26%-43%), MERS (58%) and severe ARDS (50%). 11 Patients who were male sex, older (> 65 years) and complicated with the underlying disease were more likely to develop critical illness and death. The reason why mechanical ventilation and ECMO therapy were less effective on ARDS caused by SARS-CoV-2 might be explained by the pathological changes from a COVID-19 patient. 36 In mechanically ventilated patient, multiple organ dysfunction was common, 13 and the lung was more severely injured than previously described. [28] [29] [30] In the hemorrhagic area, the pulmonary pathology showed \"alveolar tamponade\", consisted of extensive fibrinoid exudates, together with a large number of red blood cell, type II alveolar epithelial cells, macrophages and tissue cells. In the nonhemorrhage area, massive \"thick mucus embolus\" plugged the dilated bronchioles and terminal bronchial lumens, and the fibrinoid exudates deposited on the walls of pulmonary small vessels and formed ground-glass appearance, causing stenosis and occlusion of the vascular lumen. This \"vasculopathy\" was different from that of \"typical ARDS\", which mainly manifested with \"capillary leakage\". 18 In a correspondence, 34 Henry proposed that ECMO therapy might induce potential harms to the COVID-19 patients by substantially reducing in the number and function of some populations of lymphocytes and elevating the serum level of IL-6 concentrations. The repletion of lymphocytes could be key to recovery from the COVID-19, and IL-6 have a potential damage to the lung parenchyma. When selecting candidates for ECMO, the immunological status of the patients should be considered.",

Although the time for viral clearance, lesion absorption on chest CT image and hospital stay did not differ significantly from those reported in the literature, 7 10-12 25 33 statistical analysis showed the use of corticosteroids might be a risk factor for death. Besides, Thymopentin, Cordyceps Sinensis (herbal medicine) and Immunoglobulin were prescribed to our patients with lymphopenia, and increases in blood lymphocyte count were observed in 4 days, along with the remission of the disease.",

Although no other probable etiologies were identified, it might still impose an influence on the reliability of the study. However, we tested 14 patients who had a negative RT-PCR, 12 (85.7%) were positive for serum IgM or IgG antibody specific for SARS-CoV-2, highly suggesting that they had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 within weeks. Therefore, more sensitive and novel detection methods should be adopted to improve the diagnostic efficiency. Second, sample size calculation was waived in our study, and the number of patients for each subset was small, thus the case fatality rates calculated might not reflect the actual deaths of the patients. Data from other studies on SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were needed to provide a case-fatality spectrum in patients with varied severities of illness. Third, for this single-center, retrospective cohort study, there might be existing potential sources of bias in selection of participants, groupings, comparability between the survivors and non-survivors, and data missing due to incomplete medical records, etc., all of these factors might have an impact on the power of statistics. The statistical results should be interpreted with caution, and large-scaled, prospective cohort studies were needed to justify the findings of this study in the future.",

The above indicators normalized gradually on day 4 (IQR: 3-6) after admission in the survivors, while those in the non-survivors remained unchanged or worsened over time. (Table 2). The serum IgM specific for influenza A was weakly positive in one (0.9%) of 116 patients, and influenza B in three (2.6%), chlamydia and mycoplasma pneumoniae in four (3.5%), and mumps virus in one (0.9%). Candida albicans were identified on the sputum culture in two (3.3%) of 60 specimens. Procalcitonin was mildly elevated in 81 (73.6%) of 110 patients, and high sensitivity of C reaction protein elevated significantly in 70 (90.9%) of 79 patients, both of which returned gradually to normal on day 4 (IQR: 3-6) after admission in the survivors, while those in the non-survivors remained unchanged or deteriorated over time. The RT-PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 was performed on the nasopharyngeal swab at least 2 times in 108 patients, 78 (72.2%) were positive, seven (6.5%) suspected and 23 (21.3%) negative. The time window from illness onset to a negative RT-PCR was 19 (IQR: 14-34) days in 43 cases who were initially tested positive. In 15 (13.9%) cases who had a negative RT-PCR or turned negative, retesting was positive during their hospital stay. Besides, in additional 14 patients with negative RT-PCR, 12 (85.7%) were tested positive for specific serum IgM or IgG antibody on day 28 (IQR: 10-40) after symptom onset, with a cutoff value of 2.04 (IQR: 0.18-5.13). (data available on request at the REDCap web database platform, the University of Oxford). A total of 116 chest CT images was obtained at the early stage of the disease. The typical radiographic findings were mixed multifocal mottling (80 patients; 69%), ground-glass opacities (73; 62.9%), consolidation (18; 15.5%) and subpleural parenchymal band (8; 6.9%), distributed in the lung periphery. Bilateral lung involvement was observed in 105 patients (66.4%), and left lung in five (4.3%) and right lung in six (5.2%). Abnormalities distributed in the lung periphery were detected in 87 (75%) patients, and diffused infiltration in 22 (19%). On day 8 (IQR: 6-10) after onset, 57 chest CT scans were repeated, and 33 (57.9%) patients showed lesion absorption, 18 (31.6%) extended, six (10.5%) unchanged and 12 (21.1%) parenchymal bands. Prior to discharge or death (day 17 after onset, IQR: 12.5-22.5), 81 chest CT images were obtained, and 66 (81.5%) patients showed lesion absorption with four (5%) cleared completely, six (7.4%) enlarged, eight (9.9%) unchanged and 59 (72.8%) residual parenchymal bands. A typical chest CT finding over time was showed in Figure 2.TreatmentOseltamivir was orally administered in 79 patients (65.3%), 75 mg twice daily for five days (interquartile range 5-5.5), and Ribavirin intravenously in six (5.0%), Lopinavir/ritonavir in one (0.8%) and Chloroquine in one (0.8%) for 5-7 days, respectively.
