Acute sore throat is one of the most common complaints associated with upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) that result in presentation at general practice surgeries (2) or local pharmacy stores for treatment. Approximately a quarter of the population in England and Wales will consult their physician each year because of a respiratory tract infection (3). Respiratory tract infections that include URTIs and lower respiratory tract infections are the reason for 60% of all antibiotic prescribing in general practice, resulting in significant costs to the healthcare system (4).",

            "text": "Over the years, our understanding of the aetiology of sore throat has diversified beyond bacterial causes. Contrary to commonly held historical beliefs, bacterial infections are not the most common cause of sore throats. The most common bacterial cause, group A \u03b2\u2010haemolytic streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes), only account for approximately 20% of all sore throats in adults and young children (5). In fact, up to 80% of sore throats in adults are caused by viruses (5, 6), such as influenza A, respiratory syncytial virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and rhinovirus (7). Thus, antibiotics are generally not suitable for the treatment of acute sore throats (8). Many country guidelines, including the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines in the UK, have advised against the use of antibiotics for minor ailments including acute sore throat, for fear of antibiotic resistance and unnecessary exposure to potential adverse effects (4). A no or delayed antibiotic prescribing strategy was recommended for adults and children, except for those patients who are at high risk of associated complications, such as quinsy (4). Therefore, the availability of over\u2010the\u2010counter (OTC) treatments is becoming increasingly important and plays an important role in the self\u2010management of acute sore throat, especially the availability of clinically efficacious, well\u2010tolerated, fast\u2010 and long\u2010acting products.",

Although medicated topical treatments act to relieve sore throats primarily by delivering the active ingredients directly to the areas affected, gargles are only able to deliver the active ingredients to the anterior oral cavity and not the palatine tonsils or the pharynx (9). Conversely, medicated throat lozenges have the added advantage over sprays and gargles of being slow\u2010releasing (10), ensuring continuous delivery of the active ingredients to all affected areas of the throat and over a prolonged period of time (11).",

The rapid analgesic effects were also supported by the patient questionnaire survey component of this study. Peak effects of all three variables were observed 75 min after the first dose, which suggests that the analgesic benefits provided by AMC/DCBA throat lozenges were not restricted to only the time that the lozenge was present in the mouth, and that relief benefits continued long after the lozenge had dissolved. As earlier studies have shown, the mean time for an AMC/DCBA throat lozenge to dissolve in the mouth is 6.77 \u00b1 2.01 min (10). Furthermore, release of the active ingredients AMC and DCBA into the mouth was demonstrated to begin almost immediately after the lozenge was administered, with measureable quantities present in the saliva at 1 min and peak salivary concentrations at 4 min, followed by a steady decline (10). This time\u2010course release of active ingredients coincides with the findings of this study, because significant analgesic effects on throat soreness and sore throat relief, as well as on difficulty in swallowing were observed at the 5\u2010min assessment timepoint; patients expressed a sense of relief from the moment they took a lozenge. More importantly, data from this study support the notion that AMC/DCBA throat lozenges have a faster onset of analgesic action than non\u2010medicated lozenges, as indicated by the greater than 80\u2010times shorter median time first to report of \u2018moderate\u2019 pain relief data.",

The greatest differences were observed at the end of Day 3, which suggests that continued use of AMC/DCBA throat lozenges over a 3\u2010day period can significantly benefit patients, with more patients likely to experience greater improvements in throat soreness, faster pain relief, greater easing of difficulty in swallowing and freedom from symptoms than those on non\u2010medicated lozenges.",

Therefore, the reduction in the severity of throat soreness induced by AMC/DCBA throat lozenges, as demonstrated in this study, is deemed clinically meaningful compared with non\u2010medicated lozenges. Patients experienced a clinically meaningful reduction of \u2265 1 in their sore throat score at 5 min after first dose, which continued to increase to \u22124.11 at the end of Day 3. As expected, a \u2018placebo effect\u2019 was observed with the non\u2010medicated lozenges, which reached \u22122.31 at the end of Day 3. This finding can be explained by the self\u2010limiting nature of acute sore throats, where patients naturally feel better over the course of time without any treatment. However, as results from this study show, treatment with AMC/DCBA throat lozenges provides added benefits to the patients that are over and above the demulcent properties of non\u2010medicated lozenges, enabling patients to feel better faster, to experience pain relief more quickly and to carry out everyday activities with greater ease.",

Whereas functional activity in the study by Weckx et al. was assessed using a categorical scale ranging from 0 (able to work and function normally in all activities) to 3 (working, studying or housekeeping activities severely impaired/unable to perform; and requiring bed rest) (26), this study utilised a different functional impairment scale that ranged from 0 = would not interfere at all to 10 = would completely interfere and assessed eight specific daily activities.
