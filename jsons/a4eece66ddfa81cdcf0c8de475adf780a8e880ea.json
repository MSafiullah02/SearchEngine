            "text": "Billions of cells undergo turnover and die via apoptosis throughout our lifetime. A prompt 25 clearance of these apoptotic cells and debris by phagocytic cells, a process known as 26 efferocytosis, is important in maintaining tissue homeostasis. Accordingly, impaired 27 efferocytosis due to the defective clearance and disrupted stages can lead to a growing 28 number of inflammation-and immune-related diseases. Although numerous studies have 29 shown the mechanisms of efferocytosis, its role in disorders, such as non-tumor and tumor 30 diseases, remains poorly understood. This review summarizes the processes and signal 31 molecules in efferocytosis, and efferocytosis-related functions in non-tumor (atherosclerosis, 32 lung diseases, etc.) and tumor diseases (breast cancer, prostate cancer, etc.), as well as 33 describes the role of involved cytokines. Of note, there is a dual role of efferocytosis in the 34 abovementioned disorders, and a paradoxical effect among non-tumor and tumor diseases in 35 terms of inflammation resolution, immune response, and disease progression. Briefly, intact 36 efferocytosis and cytokines promote tissue repair, while they contribute to tumor progression 37 via tumor microenvironment and macrophage politzerization. Additionally, this review 38 provides potential targets associated with TAM receptors and cytokines, such as tumor 39 necrosis factor \u03b1 -and CXCL5, suggesting potential novel therapeutic ways in treating 40 diseases. 41 42",

In addition, the lipid mediator, lysophosphatidylcholine, and the 78 lipid product, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), contribute to the recruitment of macrophages 79 and the inhibition of necrosis 8 . Particularly, the lysophosphatidylcholine 80 and G-protein-coupled receptor G2A system can attract phagocytes to ACs and prevent 81 autoimmunity in a \"keep calm\" mechanism 9 . Second, eat-me signals are mainly composed In conclusion, when apoptosis occurs, dying cells announce their presence to nearby 103 phagocytes by 'find-me' signals, and then recruit motile phagocytes to the place of death. 104 Meanwhile, ACs mark their outer leaflets with 'eat me' signals to allow themselves to be 105 5 recognized by phagocytes. Eat-me signals are usually retained on the inner leaflets of the 106 plasma membrane of healthy cells. Subsequently, phagocytes up-regulate the corresponding 107 cell surface receptors and bridging molecules to complete direct and indirect binding 108 between the apoptotic cells and phagocytes 13 . After combination, the Crk 109 II/Elmo-Dock180-Rac pathway is activated to promote cytoskeletal reorganization of 110 phagocytes, leading to corpse internalization 14, 15 . As a consequence (Figure 1) whether the effect of intact or impaired efferocytosis is beneficial for the body depends on 118 the diseases, which will be discussed as follows. 120 Recently, a large number of studies have identified the role of efferocytosis in non-tumor and 121 tumor diseases. The former primarily includes atherosclerosis, lung diseases, and wounds, 122 but the latter includes breast cancer, prostate cancer, and leukemia. This section focuses on 123 the relations of efferocytosis and those diseases. The next section will concentrate on the 124 association between released cytokines during efferocytosis and these mentioned disorders. Atherosclerosis and efferocytosis 130 6 When exposed to oxidized low-density lipoproteins (oxLDLs), there is a reduction of nitric 131 oxide bioavailability, leading to endothelial activation and monocyte chemotaxis.

Eat-me signals also consist of modified molecules, such as 84 intercellular adhesion molecule 3 and CD 31. Normally, PtdSer is confined to the inner 85 surface of the plasma membrane by the action of flippases that translocate PtdSer from the 86 outer leaflet. When cells undergo apoptosis, PtdSer translocates to the cell surface due to the 87 activation of scramblases and the inactivation of flippases 10 . Later,the PtdSer on ACs are 88 attachedby PtdSer receptors on phagocytes, including T cell immunoglobulin mucin receptor 89 4 (TIM4) and TIM1, stabilins and adhesion G protein-coupled receptor B1. ACs are engulfed 90 and progress to the next stage. Thirdly, bridging molecules are able to bind to both of the 91 apoptotic cells and the phagocytes with their receptor-binding domains. For instance, the 92 molecules associated with PtdSer include growth arrest-specific 6 (GAS6), protein S 93 (PROS1), and milk fat globule-epidermal growth factor 8 (MFG-E8) 5,11 , as well as the TAM 94 receptors (TYRO3, AXL, MERTK)), and the \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25 integrins 12 . Specifically, 95 MFG-E8 acts as a bridge linking apoptotic cells and macrophages via PtdSer and the \u03b1\u03b2/\u03b2 96 integrins to facilitate the tethering step, and then triggers a series of downstream signals to 97 clear ACs 3,6 . Fourthly, don't eat-me signals usually exist on non-apoptotic cells, and 98 prevents viable cells from being cleared by phagocytes. The most well-known don't eat-me 99 signal is CD47. Although CD47 can protect normal cells, it renders malignant cells resistant 100 to efferocytosis and promotes tumor progression, suggesting its contradictory role in 101 efferocytosis.",

            "text": "diseases have a closer relationship with efferocytosis. This is due to the greater number of175 phagocytic cell types (alveolar macrophages (AM\u00f8s), lung dendric cells (DCs), epithelial 176 cells and fibroblasts) and disease types (asthma, cystic fibrosis, acute lung injury (ALI) and 177 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)) involved in this process besides the 178 complex inflammatory and immune responses. Within ACs clearance, AM\u00f8s possess 179 multiple AC recognition receptors, such as TAM receptors and \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin 32,33 . CD103(+) 180 DCs have a role in acquiring and transporting ACs to the draining local lymph nodes, and 181 in presenting antigens to CD8 T cells 34 . Cultured human lung epithelial cells are reported to 182 ingest apoptotic eosinophils 35 . Additionally, with released molecules, such as vascular 183 endothelial growth factor (VEGF), effective efferocytosis promotes the maintenance of 184 normal airway and alveolar structures even in inflamed lung tissue 36,37 . 185 In contrast, defective efferocytosis increases the numbers of uncleared ACs, 186 contributing to the development of several lung diseases, especially chronic disorders. Aleksander M et al. indicated that deficiency of AXl receptor tyrosine kinase, 190 which is highly expressed on mouse airway macrophages, exaggerates lung inflammation 191 with extensive ACs in the airways in severe asthma 40 . Also, AM\u00f8s from COPD patients have 192 defective efferocytosis, especially in active smokers, and this defect is potentially linked to 193 the S1P system, particularly S1P receptor 5 41,42 . What's more, oxidant stress and proteolytic 194 events can amplify the alveolar destruction and aggravate lung damage 43 . 195 To summarize, efferocytosis plays a significant role in maintaining lung homeostasis, 196 and defective efferocytosis can cause acute and chronic lung injury due to extensive 197 inflammation (Figure 2B). Nevertheless, the mechanism by which the phagocytic cells work 198 together to have the utmost efficiency remains unknown. Furthermore, enhancers of 199 efferocytosis, which could benefit patients with combined lung diseases, also remain 200 unelucidated. These warrant thorough investigation to determine the extent of their potential 201 in clinical use. 202 Wounds and efferocytosis 203 Similar to the role of efferocytosis in atherosclerosis and lung diseases, efficient clearance of 204 ACs and reduced inflammation contribute to wound healing. Generally, wound healing 205 involves an intricate interplay between the immune system and phagocytic cells, which 206 include four phases: hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling. During wound 207 healing, there is an infiltration of abundant neutrophils. In addition, increased 208 pro-inflammatory cytokines activate endothelial cells and platelets to exert protective effects 209 44 . Of note, the timely clearance of apoptotic neutrophils is quite important for allowing 210 wound healing to enter into the proliferative phase from the inflammation phase 45,46 . 211 However, when efferocytosis fails due to mitochondrial dysfunction or reduced 212 stimulants, it will cause an overproduction of inflammatory mediators, including 213 degranulation and ROS 47-49 . Many studies demonstrate that the prolonged presence of 214 neutrophils and associated mediators in the wound milieu promotes the formation of chronic efficient neutrophil recruitment is important for wound healing, and prompt 221 efferocytosis assists in accelerating wound repair (Figure 2C). The most substantial aspect 222 that warrants investigation, is the time window of efferocytotic enhancement, especially in 223 the second stage of wound healing..224 Tumors and efferocytosis 225 Recently, TAM receptors have been shown to be overexpressed by cancer cells, but also 226 expressed by virtually all cells of the tumor microenvironment (TME) 53 . Particularly within 227 the TME, there lies an abundant cell type, known as tumor-associated macrophages 54 . 228 Upon those macrophages, the TAM receptors bind to PtsDer on ACs using Gas6 and Protein 229 S as bridging ligands to induce efferocytosis. However, they differ from non-cancer diseases, 230 as these macrophages are further polarized to a pro-tumor M2-like phenotype, followed by 231 an increased secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines, resulting in tumor progression 55 . 232 From this perspective, TAM receptor-directed therapies in preclinical studies and clinical 233 trials may have anti-cancer effects (details can be found in table 1 and table 2 in the review 234 by Kayla V. Myers et al. 56 ). Although efferocytosis-related mechanisms describing internal 235 relationships between tumor progression and efferocytosis are currently understudied, we 236 review articles about several tumors with a high global burden, such as breast cancer, 237 prostate cancer, and leukemia to show the strong connection between these tumors and 238 efferocytosis.",

Moreover, widespread cell death triggers efferocytosis-induced 247 wound-healing cytokines, such as IL-4, IL-10, IL-13, and transforming growth factor \u03b2 248 (TGF-\u03b2) in the TME to further promote metastatic tumor progression 58,59 . Herein, intact 249 efferocytosis enhances tumor progression, while defective efferocytosis promotes tumor 250 apoptosis and causes secondary necrosis, both of which are detrimental to the host. Likewise, 251 Thomas A. Werfel et al. pointed out that in lapatinib-treated HER2+ mammary tumors in 252 MMTV-Neu mice, efferocytosis cleared apoptotic tumor cells, while blockade of 253 efferocytosis induced secondary necrosis of ACs. However, the combined inhibition of 254 MERTK and indoleamine-2,3-dioxegenase (IDO1) blocked tumor metastasis and caused 255 tumor regression in 60% of MMTV-Neu mice. These results suggest that apoptotic and 256 necrotic tumor cells can exhibit their effects on tumors via efferocytosis and IDO1, 257 respectively. Therefore, inhibition of MERTK and IDO1 produces an anti-tumor effect, 258 which benefits the host 60,61 . 259 Both complete and impaired efferocytosis may have an unfavorable impact on hosts 260 with breast cancer (Figure 3); however, combining with other drugs may help solving the 261 adverse effects of efferocytosis inhibition (secondary necrosis). Thus, the combined 262 treatment may suppress tumor progression and contribute to the recovery of host following 263 chemotherapy, providing an innovative method of cancer treatment. 264 Prostate cancer and efferocytosis 265 Numerous studies have confirmed the role of macrophages in promoting tumor 266 progression in prostate cancer (PCa). Jones JD et al. identified an increased level of M2-like 267 macrophages in vitro during efferocytosis of apoptotic tumor cells than the M1-like 268 macrophages, with increased numbers of PC-3 PCa in vitro 62 . Also, Fabiana N. Soki et al. 269 suggested that MFG-E8-mediated efferocytosis can induce polarization of PCa-associated cancer cell growth. This mechanism is also confirmed by Roca H et al. who 274 found that there were increased CXCL5 serum levels and more active efferocytotic activities 275 existing in patients with PCa bone metastasis 64 . Since efferocytosis accelerates tumor 276 development, research aiming at impairing efferocytosis may suppress tumor progression. 277 For example, administration of Stat3 reduces skeletal metastatic tumor growth and decreases 278 skeletal tumor size, and CXCL5-deficient mice inhibit tumor progression, providing a clue 279 for designing additional successful therapies 62,64 . 280 Therefore, in metastatic cancers, affecting tumor-associated macrophages polarization 281 and TME via efferocytosis may limit the progression of local and metastatic lesions (Figure 282 4). Future research should be emphasized on produced cytokines, as they have a very 283 complex influence in disease. 284 Leukemia and efferocytosis 285 During the process of efferocytosis, MERTK and AXL have been implicated as promoters of 286 tumor cell survival in many hematopoietic malignancies, including acute leukemia, chronic 287 leukemia, and multiple myeloma. TAM receptors can also facilitate leukemic phenotypes by 288 interacting with other oncogenic proteins such as fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), 289 LCK/YES-Related Novel Protein Tyrosine Kinase (LYN), and fibroblast growth factor 290 receptor 3 (FGFR3) 65 . In particular, acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) is a Gas6-dependent 291 cancer, and AXL/GAS6 expression predicts poor prognosis in AML 66-68 . As an example, 292 AXL is activated in the presence of GAS6 in AML cell lines. This activation triggers the 293 downstream signaling through the AKT/PI3K and MAPK pathways, contributing to 294 oncogenic transformation 66 . Moreover, AXL physically interacts with proteins, such as FLT3, 295 FGFR, and TYRO3 to accelerate tumor cell migration and invasion 69 . In contrast, combined 296 treatment with subtherapeutic doses of doxorubicin and AXL inhibitor, BGB324, decreased 297 tumor growth in an AML xenograft model. Targeting the TAM receptors and inhibiting bone which have been confirmed to reduce tumor progression in vitro. However, 302 more in vivo studies and clinical research are still necessary 70 . Moreover, further studies are 303 still needed to uncover methods of severing connections between efferocytosis-related 304 molecules and other proteins derived from mutated genes, which may promote tumor 305 development. 306 Other tumors and efferocytosis 307 Although there are few studies that analyze the underlying mechanisms of efferocytosis in 308 tumors, Guiling Wu et al. summarized that GAS6 promotes tumor progression in various 309 tumors and systems (except intestinal tumor), including the circulatory system, locomotor 310 system, gastrointestinal system, nervous system, and urinary system 70,71 . Jing Wu et al. 311 suggested that treatment with MERTK suppression and fractionated radiation has a 312 therapeutic effect in glioblastoma. Naveed Ishaque et al. demonstrated that several mutated 313 non-coding elements have dual protagonists in metastasis and efferocytosis-/PD-L1 mediated 314 immunosuppression in colorectal cancer. Other researchers have indicated that 315 non-professional phagocytes require the recognition of PtdSer by receptor brain-specific 316 angiogenesis inhibitor 1 and actin cytoskeleton remodeling to engulf subcellular fragments in 317 human papillomavirus-positive cervical cancer 72-74 . Further mechanistic studies and 318 potential targeting are warranted. 319 INTERACTIVE ROLES OF CYTOKINES IN EFFEROCYTOSIS IN NON-TUMOR 320 AND TUMOR DISEASES 321 Cytokines are small molecule soluble polypeptide proteins secreted by immune cells and 322 tissue cells. They play a mutual regulatory role among cells to regulate cell growth, 323 differentiation, and immune responses. Biological agents that target cytokines have valuable 324 clinical application in the treatment of tumors, immune deficiency, and infection. are very complex. It has been observed that cytokines released during 329 efferocytosis may exert different effects on different disorders, making efferocytosis appear 330 contradictory. Herein, we review the types of cytokines related to efferocytosis in the 331 abovementioned six diseases, and summarize the main functions of cytokines in terms of 332 pro-and anti-inflammatory, as well as immunosuppressive functions for further study.",

            "text": "number of studies have shown several interleukins participating in efferocytosis 335 and disease regulation. We review the most frequently detected interleukins, including IL-10, have concluded that in atherosclerosis, interleukins such as IL-4, IL-13, IL-10 339 activate specific transcription factors (e.g., STATs 3 and 6, interferon regulatory factor 3, 340 peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3in macrophages to encourage inflammation 341 resolution 78 . This result has also been confirmed by many previous studies reviewed by Paul 342 N. Hopkins 79 . In recent years, Proto JD et al. indicated that Treg cell expansion could 343 improve efferocytosis in advanced atherosclerosis through a transcellular signaling pathway. 344 Treg cells secrete IL-13 to stimulate IL-10 production in macrophages, and 345 autocrine-paracrine signaling by IL-10 induced Vav1 in macrophages to activate Rac1 and 346 improve ACs engulfment 80 . Additionally, Manega CM et al. found higher 12-HETE serum 347 levels and lower IL-10 levels in patients with coronary artery disease than in healthy 348 individuals, but the 12(S)-HETE-mediated inflammatory effect can be counteracted by 349 Atorvastatin (0.1 \u00b5M) 31 . Therefore, IL-10 plays a role in the reduction of inflammation in 350 atherosclerosis. Additionally, recent strategies of Treg-cell-enhancement or Atorvastatin 351 administration may benefit people with advanced plaques, though more studies and clinical 352 trials are needed. within the host 83 . These contradictory effects of IL-10 in lung diseases 360 reveal a different perspective towards efferocytosis in infectious diseases. In wound healing 361 accompanied with increased IL-10, efferocytosis up-regulated cellular fatty acids to fuel 362 mitochondrial respiration and activate an NAD+-dependent signal transduction cascade to 363 induce an anti-inflammatory response. This anti-inflammatory reaction is also found in 364 another study, which implies that elevated macrophage miR-21 promotes efferocytosis and 365 silences target genes PTEN and PDCD4 49,84 . 366 In regards to tumors, there are few studies directly showing the role of IL-10. 367 Widespread cell death in breast cancer during postpartum involution triggers wound-healing 368 cytokines, including IL-4, IL-13, and IL-10 in the TME to promote metastatic tumor 369 progression. Other researchers exhibited upregulation of antiphagocytic genes, such as IL-10 370 and IL-18 in African American patient-derived PCa TME 58,85 . Whether IL-10 has crucial 371 functions in anti-inflammation or in tumor progression similar to that of non-tumor diseases, 372 and whether it is useful in inhibiting tumor development via reducing IL-10 in TME deserves 373 future explorations.374 IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 375 The role of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 seems contrary to that of IL-10. Accompanied by enhanced level 376 of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6, a deficiency of macrophage scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) and 377 macrophage LRP-1 increase cell death and inflammation in atherosclerosis. The mechanism 378 involves impaired efferocytosis via the Src/PI3K/Rac1 pathway, and inhibited Akt activation 379 86,87 . Similarly, a reduced efferocytotic ability of alveolar macrophage to ACs, with increased 380 IL-1\u03b2, encourages neutrophilic inflammation in bronchiectasis and asthma 88,89 . Of note, via various ways 90 . Although IL-1\u03b2 is found to promote inflammation in 386 non-tumor diseases, there is little evidence that elucidates the role of IL-1\u03b2 in tumors or factors (GF) refer to a group of cytokines that can promote the growth and 390 differentiation of corresponding cells. TGF-\u03b2 is the most well-researched GF, which plays a 391 role in anti-inflammation, similar to the role of IL-10 in efferocytosis, and how VEGF 392 sometimes participates in resolving wound inflammation and improving angiogenesis 45 . In 393 studies, M2 macrophages are found to secrete IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 to enhance 394 atherosclerosis regression. Two main signaling pathways, the Akt/mTORC/LXR pathway 395 and the JAK/STAT6 pathway, are associated with M2 polarization 86,91 . Similarly, TGF-\u03b2 has 396 an anti-inflammatory function in lung diseases and wounds. For instance, PPAR\u03b3 activation 397 can resolve lung inflammation and fibrosis, but inhibition of PPAR\u03b3 reversed these results by 398 inhibiting efferocytosis and decreasing the expression of TGF-\u03b2 and IL-10 92 . Additionally, 399 TGF-\u03b2 signaling can induce alternative macrophage activation, and defective T\u03b2RII 400 signaling downregulates interactions with other immune cells, such as T-cells, by inhibiting 401 M2 polarization. It is TGF-\u03b2 that results in attenuated anti-inflammation in the lung 93 . 402 Nevertheless, efferocytosis with increased TGF-\u03b2 and IL-10 secretion increased 403 Mycobacterium leprae survival in M\u03d51 cells from paucibacillary leprosy patients, and 404 contributed to the persistence and sustained infection of the mycobacterium 94 . Taken 405 together, TGF-\u03b2 contributes to macrophage polarization and inflammation attenuation in 406 non-tumor diseases. However, as there is always a accompanie changed level of IL-10, 407whether this protection is derived from IL-10 or from TGF-\u03b2 alone remains unclear. Whether 408 it is effective to treat diseases by inducing macrophage polarization through increasing 409 TGF-\u03b2 levels also remains to be determined.",

In postpartum tumors, there is increased TGF-\u03b2 in the clearance of dying tumor 415 cells, but TGF-\u03b2 blockade inhibited postpartum tumor metastasis 58 . Therefore, TGF-\u03b2 acts 416 as tumor contributor. However, studies are too few to draw this conclusion. The method by 417 which TGF-\u03b2 promotes tumor progression is not well described in studies. Finally, is this 418 function associated with anti-inflammation in TME? 419 Colony-stimulating factor 420 CSF is a group of factors that can stimulate the differentiation and proliferation of 421 pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells and hematopoietic progenitor cells at different 422 developmental stages. CSF mainly includes 423 granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF),M-CSF, erythropoietin (EPO).424In some experiments, they have been observed in the process of efferocytosis.Since 425 macrophages have been extensively used as a model for efferocytosis and 426 polarization, Ivanov S et al. revealed that mesothelial cells produce membrane-bound and 427 secreted CSF1 to sustain peritoneal macrophage growth in order to maintain tissue 428 homeostasis 96 . Kawano M et al. found that CSF treatments increased the percentage of 429 CD62L senescent neutrophils in the spleen of null mice, to prevent mice from developing a 430 lupus-like autoimmune disease. Other researchers observed that the delivery of recombinant 431 GM-CSF to the alveolar space restored the efferocytotic capability of AMs to protect against 432 pneumonia. Lai YS et al. concluded that murine bone marrow-derived macrophages induced 433 by M-CSF can be further polarized into the M2 phenotype by baicalin, to have an 434 anti-inflammatory effect 10,97-99 . In addition, EPO is involved in this process. Luo B et al. 435 indicated that PPAR\u03b3 was significantly decreased in obese mice and EPO increased 436 macrophage PPAR\u03b3 to promote efferocytosis in obese mice 100 . Moreover, EPO seems more 437 suitable than PPAR\u03b3 agonists in obesity-related inflammation regulation. The reason is that , CSF promotes tissue repair through inducing macrophage. However, 441 leukocyte depletion frequently occurs in patients with tumors, and GM-CSF is often used to 442 stimulate leukocyte growth during chemotherapy. Further clinical research is necessary to 443 determine whether GM-CSF enhances tumor progression through inspiring efferocytosis, 444 and how to control the adverse effects caused by GN-CSF. 445 Interferon 446 IFN is named for its interference with viral replication, and it has antiviral, anti-cell 447 proliferation, anti-tumor, and immune regulation effects. IFN is divided into type I and type 448 II IFN. Type I IFN includes IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2, and is produced by virus-infected cells. 449 However, Type II IFN, IFN\u03b3, is mainly produced by activated T cells and NK cells. Studies450 have proven that IFN is involved in efferocytosis. It was observed that IFN-\u03b3-induced 451 autophagy triggered the extracellular secretion of Annexin A2 (ANXA2) in lung epithelial 452 cells, leading to enhanced efferocytosis 102 . Other studies have suggested a positive role of 453 IFN to host. They identify IFN-\u03b2 as an effector cytokine, involved in resolving bacterial 454 inflammation, and they indicate that IFN-\u03b3 improved the responsiveness of macrophages to 455 Staphylococcus aureus (SA) 103,104 . 456 IFN also functions in tumors, showing an anti-tumor role of IFN\u03b3. Long-term activated 457 DCs fail to effectively activate alloreactive IFN\u03b3-responsive T cells, and they changed their 458 profile toward a non-functional and tumor-promoting phenotype 105 . What's more, in the last 459 step of efferocytosis, Larissa D. Cunha et al. showed that tumor-associated macrophages 460 with LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP) displayed M2 characteristics and reduced secretion 461 of IFN\u03b3, which suppressed the anti-tumor response. TAM lacking LAP exhibited M1 462 characteristics and increased stimulation of IFN genes (STING)-dependent type I IFN 463 production to promote IFN\u03b3, resulting in anti-tumor responses. It was the impairment of 464 LC3-associated phagocytosis in myeloid cells of TME that had anti-tumor effects 106 . 465 Although their studies support a role for LAP, these components possibly function in another puts forward a rationale that PS-targeting, anti-TAM receptor, and 471 anti-PD-L1-based therapeutics will have great advantages 107 . 472 Tumor necrosis factor 473 TNF was originally named for its ability to cause necrosis of tumor tissue, and there are two 474 main types in TNF family: TNF-\u03b1 and TNF\u03b2. TNF-\u03b1 is produced by activated monocytes or 475 macrophages, and TNF\u03b2 is mainly produced by activated T cells. The TNF family has a 476 crucial role in regulating immune responses, killing target cells, and inducing apoptosis. We 477 mainly review the function of released TNF in diseases, especially in tumors, to find 478 potential therapeutic ways associated with efferocytosis. In atherosclerosis, mechanistic 479 studies identify the TNF\u03b1 as a fundamental driver of impaired AC removal, accounting for 480 the activation of NF-IDO 1 and a compromised role of defective efferocytosis in vascular 481 disease 26,79,86 . However, the selective activation of cannabinoid type 2 receptor (CB2) by 482 JWH-133 and HU-308, with reduced levels of TNF\u03b1 and oxLDL-induced ROS, improves 483 efferocytosis of normal-cultured and oxLDL-loaded macrophages. This process promotes the 484 stability of atherosclerotic plaques 108 . The function of TNF\u03b1 is similar in wound healing 485 because the successful efferocytosis of ACs can suppress LPS-induced NF-\u03baB activation 486 andTNF\u03b1 expression 84 . However, there is a dual role of reduced TNF\u03b1 in lung diseases. On 487 one hand, it was observed that the CD73-A2a axis in macrophages causes reduction of TNF\u03b1, 488 linking early inflammatory events to subsequent immune responses to ACs 109 . On the other 489 hand, the reduced inflammatory response by fluticasone plus ACs through reducing TNF\u03b1, 490 CCL3, and CCL5 can increase the risk for CAP in COPD patients 110 . In a sense, reducing 491 TNF\u03b1 and suppressing inflammation is not always beneficial, and their effects vary among that illustrate the function of the TNF family in numerous tumors. For example, 496TNF-\u03b1 is an essential pro-inflammatory cytokine found in the TME of breast cancer patients.497TNF-\u03b1 is involved in all stages of breast cancer progression, including cell proliferation,498    survival motility, and acquired resistance to chemotherapy. TNF\u03b1 also mediated 499 pro-tumorigenic pathways through binding to TNFR1 and TNFR2. As a consequence, tumor 500 proliferation and migration are enhanced via several signaling pathways, such as the p42/p48 501 MAPK, PI3K/AKT, and p38/MAPK pathways in different breast cancer cell lines 111 .

There was 512 a reduction of more than 50% in the size of plaque lesions in the aortic root and the 513 abdominal aorta of Apoe\u2212/\u2212Ccr5\u2212/\u2212 mice[112][113][114][115] . Since it may be easier to detect mRNA 514 levels of the ligands CCL3, 4, and 5 in circulating leukocytes than chemokine receptors, the 515 ligands could serve as clinically relevant biomarkers115  .516    Recently, the role of chemokines in the lungs has drawn interest among researchers.517Different from the effect in atherosclerosis, genetic deletion of the CCL2 receptor in mice 518 with \u03b21 integrin-deficient type 2 alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) reduced AECs efferocytosis,519    and accelerated inflammation. This study indicates a necessary requirement for recruited 520 monocytes/macrophages in limiting lung injury 116 . However, COPD macrophages release resolve acute lung inflammation, chemokines that attract inflammation cells527 have a dual function 117 . It encouraged inflammatory responses to clear bacteria and 528 prevented further injury to the lung, and promoted tissue repair via enhanced efferocytosis. 529 On the other side, it induces inflammation and impairs efferocytosis, preventing effective 530 clearance of excessive inflammatory cells. There is a dynamic balance of inflammatory 531 response and a 'flexible' effect of chemokines and efferocytosis. Therefore, whether the 532 function of chemokines and efferocytosis is good or bad for the host varies depending upon 533 situations. In wound healing, the responses of a number of CXC and CX3C chemokines 534 temporarily recruit neutrophils to injured sites during the inflammatory phase, and accelerate 535 the clearance of necrotic neutrophils during the transition into the proliferative phase, 536 supporting a positive role of chemokines in the wound 44 .537In addition to non-tumor diseases, chemokines also have a position in tumors.538Researchers have observed that macrophage-driven efferocytosis of PCa in vitro activated 539 Stat3 and NF-\u03baB (p65) signaling to stimulate the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine, 540 CXCL5, whose deficiency reduced tumor progression. As CXCL5 mediated inflammation 541 and tumor growth in bone, it may serve as a potential target for cancer therapeutics 64 .542    Akalu YT et al. indicated that chemokines (e.g., CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CXCL9, and 543 CXCL10) allow effector T cells to migrate into the TME to mediate tumor destruction, but544 poor chemokine-mediated trafficking of T cells favors tumor growth 118-121 . Lacking evidence, 545 the source of released chemokines during efferocytosis in tumors remains unclear. Whether 546 there are other functions related to different chemokines in TME should be further studied.547What's more, is it possible to use chemokines to predict survival rate in patients with 548 tumors? 549 A summary of cytokines associated with efferocytosis in diseases dual functions, depending on the situation. According to numerous studies on 553 atherosclerosis, lung diseases, and on tumors, we conclude that IL-10, TGF-\u03b2, and IFN-\u03b3 554 contribute to the resolution of inflammation, and that CSF enhances tissue repair. IL-1\u03b2,555    TNF\u03b1, and certain chemokines promote inflammation in non-tumor diseases. In tumors, IL-4,556 IL-13, IL-10, TGF-\u03b2, and CXCL5 increases tumor cell growth and metastasis through 557 efferocytosis-induced cell clearance and macrophage polarization in TME. IFN-\u03b3 and other 558 cytokines, such as CCL2, 3 and CXCL9, 10 have anti-tumor roles. There is a dynamic 559 balance of efferocytosis related to inflammation and tissue repair or tumor progression. 560 Finding effective targets related to cytokines, such as CXCL5, and IL-1\u03b2, may shed light on 561 the above-mentioned diseases. 562 Regardless of the small amount of evidence showing TNF-\u03b1 and efferocytosis in tumors, 563 TNF-\u03b1 have important implications in the course of various diseases. For instance, studies 564 have exhibited a dual role of TNF-\u03b1 in treating breast cancer as a drug and a target. In animal 565 models, both TNF-\u03b1 intra-tumoral administration in combination with different conventional 566 therapies, and application of TNF-\u03b1 monoclonal antibodies decrease tumor growth and 567 metastatic potential of breast tumors 111 . Potential therapy through TNF-\u03b1 occurs in other 568 solid tumors, like PCa, in which the MiR-130b/TNF-\u03b1/NF-\u03baB/VEGFA loop 569 suppresses PCa angiogenesis 122 . In leukemia, TNF-\u03b1 contributes to tumorigenesis and 570 activates the suppressive functions of Treg. These improve tumor's ability to evade the 571 immune system, indicating a way to use anti-TNF therapy in leukemia 123 . Although the 572 clinical usage of TNF-\u03b1 has been limited by toxicity and side effects, using TNF-\u03b1 alone or 573 in combination with chemotherapy and radiotherapy as an adjuvant in cancer may offer great 574 promise for tumor treatment. Furthermore, employing nanoparticles or tumor-homing 575 peptides may be a more viable option 124 . 576 CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVES: WILL EFFEROCYTOSIS BE THE FUTURE diseases, and wound healing), solid tumors (especially breast cancer 581 and prostate cancer), and leukemia. With the combined information of recent articles and 582 reviews, we find a paradoxical effect of efferocytosis in non-tumor and tumor diseases and 583 some notable points of each type. 584 In atherosclerosis, effective efferocytosis in the early stages contributes to inflammation 585 resolution, but in the advanced stage, reducing oxLDL and inhibiting cleavage of MERTK 586 can suppress the impairment of efferocytosis. Additionally, increasing IL-10, IL-4, IL-13, 587 TGF-\u03b2, and reducing IL-1\u03b2, Il-6, TNF-\u03b1, CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5 can slow the progression 588 of atherosclerosis. Of note, some miRs participate in the early and later stages of 589 atherosclerosis by modulating endothelial activation, monocyte chemotaxis, and by 590 regulating foam cell accumulation and inflammatory responses, respectively. These miRs 591 may represent potential molecular targets for anti-atherosclerotic therapy, though the 592 selectivity of miR-based therapy delivery systems remains a major challenge in drug 593 development (see Figure 2 and Table 1 in 75 ). The main function of intact and defective 594 efferocytosis is similar in inflammation reduction and tissue repair in lung diseases. However, 595 there may be an adverse effect in bacterial pneumonia because of the decreased 596 inflammation as a result of improved efferocytosis cannot clear infected cells, but CCL2 can 597 enhance efferocytosis in murine pneumonia to promote lung repair, suggesting a dual 598 function of efferocytosis in certain lung diseases 110,117 . Moreover, there are various 599 macrophages exhibiting functions in different lung diseases, but the role of efferocytosis is 600 dependent upon the situation. As for wounds, valid efferocytosis and its cytokines have a 601 positive role in healing, similar to its function in atherosclerosis and lung diseases, but 602 improving the rate of ACs clearance is a key factor, as there is an inflammatory phase during 603 the repair process several days after injury 47 . In conclusion, apart from some opposite results 604 in several conditions, efferocytosis has benefits to hosts with non-tumor conditions. 605 Although intact efferocytosis shows anti-inflammation and immune suppression in 606 tumors, especially TME, it creates an environment suitable for tumor cell growth and escape from recognition 58,125 . Impairing efferocytosis to block the above 610 mechanisms seems possible. Additionally, targeting the TAM receptors and inhibiting the 611 bone marrow microenvironment may be useful in ameliorating leukemia 69 . Nevertheless, 612 inhibiting efferocytosis may not provide substantial benefits for the body because of the 613 effects caused by secondary necrosis, but suppressing efferocytosis and necrosis via 614 inhibition of MerTK and IDO1 may exhibit an anti-tumor effect without damage to the host 615 in breast cancer patients 60,61 . Furthermore, as cytokines can assist tumor progression, 616 targeting IL-4, IL-13, IL-10, TGF-\u03b2, and CXCL5 or enhancing IFN-\u03b3 and some chemokines 617 (e.g., CCL2,3 and CXCL9, 10) may inhibit tumor invasion and metastasis. A combination of 618 chemotherapy or radiotherapy may provide a novel therapeutic method for cancer treatment.619 The toxicity and efficacy of those drugs are under consideration. However, there is an 620 interesting point related to efferocytosis and anticancer drugs. When anticancer drugs cause 621 apoptosis-induced death of cancer cells, efferocytosis in TME is started, followed by 622 excessive anti-inflammatory cytokines (TGF\u03b2, PGE2, PAF and IL-10). This process leads a 623 silent antitumor response by the immune system. Activated efferocytosis facilitates tumor 624 progression, making the situation quite complicated. Drugs like doxorubicin may promote 625 the expression of eat-me signals on the surface of tumor. Therefore, a serious reconsideration 626 is expected on anticancer drugs and efferocytosis in treating tumors 5 . 627 For future studies, we propose four questions related to efferocytosis and hope to 628 provide an effective path for drug development. First, how can researchers efficiently delay 629 the progress of atherosclerosis and how can they effectively control the time window or 630 neutrophil recruitment to maximize the effects of efferocytosis in tissue repair or wound 631 healing? Second, how can one make full use of TAM receptors to promote illnesses, since 632 TAM receptors have crucial role in efferocytosis? Third, what methods can be used to 633 polarize involved macrophages into the necessary phenotype to modulate anti-inflammation 634 and immune system? Fourth, what can be done to combine efferocytosis and chemotherapy 635 to treat tumors without subjecting the host to any potential toxic effects? As there are few The process and mechanism of efferocytosis. The process of efferocytosis 946 involves four steps, including the recruitment of phagocytic cells, the recognition, 947 phagocytosis, and digestion of apoptotic cells. Roles and effects of the impaired efferocytosis in the most often studied 949 non-tumor diseases. A. In atherosclerosis, the impaired efferocytosis because of 950 exposure to oxLDLs and disturbed processes of recognition, such as MERTK cleavage and 951 CD47 up-regulation, leads to the formation of necrotic and plaque development. B. In lung 952 diseases, the inefficient efferocytosis leads to damaged airway and cell necrosis due to an 953 accumulation of neutrophils and released cytokines. As there are different types of 954 phagocytic cells, results of efferocytosis vary from specific lung diseases. C. During wound 955 healing, the defective efferocytosis cannot clear ACs promptly, resulting in enlarged wound. The dual function of intact and impaired efferocytosis in breast cancer. 957 Efficient efferocytosis is stimulated by SIAH2-NRF1 axis to trigger M2-like macrophage 958 polarization and cytokines (e.g., IL-10, TGF-\u03b2) release, to create a tolerogenic TME, leading 959 to increased tumor progression and migration. On the other hand, impairing efferocytosis 960 through inhibiting MERTK or NRF1 can lead to secondary necrosis, and bring 961 an unfavorable impact on hosts. However, co-inhibition of efferocytosis and necrosis via 962 MERTK inhibitor and IDO1 inhibitor can suppress tumor progression.",
