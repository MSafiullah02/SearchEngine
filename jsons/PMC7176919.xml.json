This lung injury can be the result of primary pulmonary parenchymal injury such as pneumonia or aspiration or from a systemic process such as sepsis or trauma. Increased capillary permeability leading to inflammation is the inciting factor for ARDS. Damage to the capillary endothelium and alveolar epithelium results in protein accumulation within the alveoli, activation of proinflammatory cytokines, and then pulmonary fibrosis. This cascade leads to loss of functional lung tissue. Chest radiography demonstrates bilateral opacities. As ARDS progresses, lung compliance decreases, hypoxemia ensues, and patients can progress to ventilator dependence (3,4).",

Mild ARDS, moderate ARDS, and severe ARDS are defined as a PaO2/FiO2 of 200 to 300, 100 to 200, and <100, respectively (5).",

Until more COVID-19\u2013specific evidence-based medicine is available, expert recommendations support adherence to these ventilatory strategies in patients with COVID-19 (6). Mechanical ventilation is recommended for patients with moderate or severe ARDS who remain hypoxemic or profoundly symptomatic despite supplemental oxygen. In mechanically ventilated patients, a lung-protective ventilation strategy should be employed to decrease ventilator-induced lung injury. When treating ARDS patients with mechanical ventilation, the target tidal volume is typically 6 ml/kg of predicted body weight with goal plateau pressure <30 cm H2O. One interesting finding in COVID-19 ARDS is that some patients are found to be severely hypoxemic, but with surprisingly good lung compliance. In these patients, more liberal tidal volume settings may be considered. PEEP should be adjusted based on FiO2, with consideration of higher PEEP (>10 cm H2O) in moderate and severe ARDS. Notably, lung protective ventilation (low tidal volume) allows permissive respiratory acidosis with maintenance of a pH \u22657.25. Relative hypoxemia with a PaO2 of 55 to 80 mm Hg or SpO2 of 88% to 95% may also be considered to limit high oxygen requirements (3). In patients with ARDS with PaO2/FiO2 \u2264150 mm Hg, consideration should be given to initiation of prone positioning. If significant ventilator dyssynchrony is present, neuromuscular blockade may also be considered (7).",

In the intensive care unit, most patients undergoing mechanical ventilation will have an endotracheal tube (ETT) in place. This is a polyvinylchloride tube that is placed between the vocal cords and into the trachea. ETTs have various internal diameters. Most adults will be intubated with a 7.0- to 8.0-mm ETT. The smaller the internal diameter, the higher the resistance to airflow, and the more the patient and/or the ventilator will have to work to overcome this resistance. ETTs have inflated cuffs (balloons) that occupy the space of the trachea, ensuring all gas exchange occurs via the ETT, while offering some protection to the lung from gastric and oral secretions. On chest radiography, the distal end of the ETT should be 4 \u00b1 2 cm above the level of the carina to ensure correct placement. After placement of the ETT, auscultation for bilateral breath sounds is imperative. A chest radiograph should be ordered immediately to further confirm correct tube location.",

Consider VC as the initial mode of mechanical ventilation. This ensures adequate tidal volume and minimizes the risk of volutrauma. In accordance with the ARDSnet (ARDS Network) study protocol, it is reasonable to choose an initial tidal volume of 6 ml/kg (predicted body weight). Begin with an initial FiO2 of 1.0, which may then be gradually decreased as tolerated, while monitoring pulse oximetry. It is advisable to reference the widely published ARDSnet protocol for guidance in determining appropriate PEEP for a given FiO2. Decisions regarding a lower versus higher PEEP strategy may be tailored based on underlying cardiac physiology. Initially, it is reasonable to consider a higher PEEP strategy. Initial respiratory rate should be set to approximate the patient\u2019s pre-intubation minute ventilation (usually 20 to 28 breaths/min); this may then be adjusted based on the patient\u2019s arterial pCO2 (Figure 1\n).",

One of the most common methods for doing this is careful monitoring of the plateau pressure (Figure 2\n). Although the peak inspiratory pressure represents the pressure to which the proximal large airways are exposed, the plateau pressure is representative of the pressure present in the alveoli at end inspiration, and thus is an indicator of transpulmonary pressure, lung overdistention, and ventilator-induced lung injury. Plateau pressure is measured after a 0.5- to 1.0-s inspiratory pause maneuver. If the plateau pressure is >30 cm H2O, consider further reducing the delivered tidal volume. It is also important to monitor the patient\u2019s driving pressure, or difference between the PEEP and plateau pressure, as increased driving pressures have been associated with higher mortality in ARDS (10).",
