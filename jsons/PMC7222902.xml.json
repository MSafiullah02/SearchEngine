            "text": "Patient satisfaction, as measured by post-hospitalization surveys, is a recognized quality metric that typically assesses satisfaction over the course of an entire hospital stay [1, 2]. However, the use of post-hospital surveys poses a problem for intensive care units, such as a neurointensive care unit (NICU). A NICU is a specialized unit that bridges the fields of neurology, neurosurgery, neuroradiology, neuroanesthesiology, and critical care medicine to care for critically ill patients with neurological illness and/or injury. Because of the interdisciplinary nature of the NICU, there are many teams involved in the care of the patient which can affect consistency of caregiver\u2013patient communication and, therefore, ultimately satisfaction [3\u20135]. In a study evaluating 124 critically ill patients at time of discharge, inconsistent caregiver\u2013patient communication was reported in 21.5% of patients, most within 48 h of admission [6]. 19.4% of those surveyed indicated that these inconsistent messages affected satisfaction, and 9.7% indicated that these inconsistencies also made decision making difficult [6].",

Shared medical decision making in the NICU is defined by the patient and/or their surrogate(s), the nurse, and the multiple medical teams working collaboratively to make decisions and come up with care plans while balancing risk stratification and patient preferences. Shared medical decision making requires regular, transparent meetings between the ICU team and surrogates and requires skills in communication, conflict resolution, and the ability to facilitate discourse [7, 9\u201312]. Thus, measurement of both satisfaction with care and satisfaction with decision making surrounding care is a key variable to measure in ICU quality improvement projects. The Family Satisfaction in the ICU (FS-ICU) survey is a validated survey consisting of 24 questions on these two areas [6]. The first fourteen questions focus on satisfaction with care, while the remaining ten questions focus on satisfaction with decision making [6].",

            "text": "Delivery of ICU care is evolving. There is an increased demand in efficiency and quality of care along with an aging population with chronic medical diseases [13, 14]. This places strain on the healthcare system, particularly with growing physician and nursing shortages [13]. The use of advanced practice providers (APPs) to assist healthcare teams in delivery of care is becoming more common [13]. An APP is a non-physician with a license to practice in collaboration with a physician in a variety of settings. In the critical care setting, APPs have been utilized in this collaborative fashion and, compared to other team models (such as trainee model using residents and/or fellows), length of stay and patient mortality were found to be similar [14]. Compliance with clinical practice guidelines was also found to be greater in APP-managed surgical intensive care units compared to other team models [15]. As a patient\u2019s length of stay rises in the NICU, the number of healthcare provider interactions also increases. However, little is known how unit staffing with hired and consistent APPs compares to care provided by rotating physician trainees with respect to overall ICU satisfaction and shared medical decision making.",

Patients had to be admitted for greater than 24 h in order for their respondent to participate in the survey. An attending physician identified eligible respondents twice a week in each unit and delivered a survey tablet device that directly inputted FS-ICU data into a REDCap electronic data capture tool hosted at our institution. REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is a secure, Web-based application designed to support data capture for research studies. Only one survey was completed per patient. Once the respondent completed a survey, the tablet was returned either to the nurse or to the health unit coordinator and subsequently sanitized. Due to the unknown duration in the length of stay for each individual patient, surveys were given to respondents as soon as possible after eligibility identification, and to ensure that only one survey was given per patient, they were not administered at the time of hospital discharge nor at longer-term intervals.

One unit is 14 beds and the other is 10 beds. The 14-bed unit is managed by a neurointensivist who collaborates with a rotation of 10 APPs. Each APP generally rotates on service for 2\u20133 straight days (6:30 am\u20136:30 pm) or 3 straight nights (6:30 pm\u20136:30am). The 10-bed unit is managed by a separate neurointensivist along with one of four neurocritical care fellows and two to three rotating resident physician trainees pooled from the Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Emergency Room residency programs. The neurocritical care fellow rotates on service for 2 weeks at a time either on a 12-h day shift (6:30 am\u20136:30 pm) or a 12-h night shift (6:30 am\u20136:30 pm). Neurology, emergency room, and neurosurgery residents rotate on service every 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 3 months, respectively. Residents remain on service for 5 to 6 days at a time and provide coverage only during the 12-hour day shift. The two units manage patients of similar type and severity as the allocation of admissions between the two units is solely based on nursing staff and bed availability. Bedsides, rounding structure is similar between the two units. Rounds are nurse-driven and are conducted from a rounding sheet using a systems-based approach. Family and surrogates, if available, are encouraged to participate in rounds. Both units have dedicated neuropharmacists and respiratory therapists that also actively participate in bedside rounds. If there are remaining unanswered questions or details regarding the patient\u2019s care that require further clarification, a separate family meeting is held after daily rounding is completed. Depending on the complexity of the family meetings, these are held by the APP or trainee alone, or in the presence of the attending physician.",

All possible two-way interaction terms with unit type were introduced to these models, to determine if there was a differential effect of this variable on outcomes.

It is not known why children of patients felt less satisfied with care. It is quite possible that outcomes may be poorer in older patients and/or there could be less communication with a family of an older patient compared to a younger patient [3].

Analyses found that improving the waiting room atmosphere did not lead to overall improvement in satisfaction and that treatment of the patient and communication with the patients and their families were the drivers of satisfaction scores.

This study was a single-center retrospective analysis of a prospective quality improvement program. Although several NICU models at academic centers incorporate a similar two-team format of separate APPs and trainees, this study is not generalizable to units that combine APPs and trainees. Although the FS-ICU is a validated scale, the Likert scale that it widely uses has some limitations such as a non-normative distribution of its response choices. The timing of the survey in our study also does not reflect the full stay of the patient, and satisfaction scores may be altered with changes that may have occurred through the hospital course of a patient with critical illness. This includes not having data on withdrawal of life sustaining therapy, in-hospital mortality, or follow-up outcomes (such as at 6 months). Although the response rate was higher than expected, there remains a challenge to connect with families at bedside. Clinicians were also knowledgeable about the collection of FS-ICU data, and although asked not to alter behaviors, it is possible that some teams or caregivers may have become hypervigilant. Despite the limitations of this study, we feel this study provides valuable information on family satisfaction between an APP and trainee neurocritical care unit. Future projects should assess FS-ICU with modification of rounding style (such as where rounding occurs) to improve patient\u2013caregiver communication and limit inconsistent messages.
