On the same day, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially named the disease caused by this virus as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Following the advice of the Emergency Committee, the WHO Director-General has declared the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak as a \u201cpublic health emergency of international concern\u201d and pandemic, for the reason that the virus might spread to countries that do not have robust health systems.3 As of April 2, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has caused 896,450 infections and 45,526 deaths worldwide, which is a tragic milestone.4\n",
