In such a scenario and given the experiences of various countries hit by the disease, it is expected that frontline health care providers (HP) would suffer from mental health consequences (Lai et al., 2020) . The impact of COVID-19 among the general population is also considerable as is evident across the world. In such a scenario, the role of a psychiatrist is likely to be important both in short and long-term (Banerjee, 2020) .

Treating doctors do not have solutions to these problems but patients have no one else to turn to. Possible solution: a background multi-disciplinary team can help. Development of tools/ Screening questionnaires to rapidly identify problem areas, getting on board local administration etc. can be possible solutions. 2 Stigma is an unexplored area. Patient stigma has been found to be a major cause of suppression of travel history and jumping quarantine. In all likelihood, discharged patients are also likely to face stigma and face difficulty in reintegration with their families and communities. Currently HP is not equipped to handle this issue.
