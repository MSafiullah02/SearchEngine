Such patients exhibit great diversity in conditions necessitating care in the ICU, age, underlying medical problems, and integrity of physiologic compensatory mechanisms. All these patients, however, share the need for optimized oxygen-carrying capacity and tissue perfusion. Ongoing blood loss resulting from injuries, surgical wounds, invasive monitoring equipment, and blood sampling requirements, coupled with inadequate marrow function and, in some, red cell destruction, makes red cell transfusion a necessity for many ICU patients. Additionally, many patients are susceptible to the development of hemostatic disorders requiring the administration of such blood components as plasma, cryoprecipitate, or platelet concentrates.",

The process of donor selection and screening has become increasingly stringent, an evolution that began in response to the well-defined risks of transfusion-transmitted hepatitis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Although the value of maximizing recipient safety is unarguable, increasing donor selectivity has its price. As more tests are added and more conditions placed on the donor, the number of usable donations has declined. This trend has led to occasional regional and seasonal blood shortages and, rarely, outright inability to provide certain blood components. Clinicians who prescribe blood components must be aware of these uncertainties in availability and contribute by using blood products appropriately while the national blood banking system seeks strategies to ensure an adequate, safe blood supply.",

Compensatory mechanisms for acute and chronic anemia are diverse and complex.16, 17 All work in concert to maintain oxygenation within the microcirculation. Cardiovascular adjustments leading to increased cardiac output include decreased afterload and increased preload resulting from changes in vascular tone, increased myocardial contractility, and elevated heart rate. Lowered blood viscosity permits improved flow of erythrocytes within capillaries. Blood flow is redistributed to favor critical organs with higher oxygen extraction. Pulmonary mechanisms, though contributing relatively little to short-term oxygenation demands, exert potent effects on related metabolic variables. Finally, the hemoglobin molecule can undergo biochemical and conformational changes to enhance unloading of oxygen at the capillary level. All these mechanisms contribute to an \u201coxygen reserve\u201d capacity that exceeds baseline requirements by approximately fourfold.16\n",

Mixed venous oxygen content (P\u03bdO2) and cardiac output can be measured in patients undergoing pulmonary artery catheterization; arterial oxygen content can also be measured directly. The oxygen extraction ratio (ER) can be calculated directly, and in the presence of normal or high cardiac output it is a measure of tissue oxygen extraction and, indirectly, the adequacy of tissue oxygen delivery. The total body ER at baseline is about 25%. A falling P\u03bdO2 and an ER increasing to greater than 50% have been proposed as indicators of the need for red cell transfusion.21\n",

At 30 days from randomization, the restrictive strategy was at least as good as, if not better than (P = .11) the liberal strategy, and overall hospital mortality was significantly lower in the restrictive strategy group (P = .05). For patients younger than 55 years and for patients with lower (<20) APACHE (Acute Physiology, Age, and Chronic Health Evaluation) II scores, the restrictive strategy was clearly superior. In addition, liberal transfusion was not associated with shorter ICU stays, less organ failure, or shorter hospital stays; longer mechanical ventilation times and cardiac events were more frequent in the liberal strategy group. A later subgroup analysis of patients with cardiovascular disease, though small enough to have statistical doubt, suggested that a more liberal transfusion strategy was probably appropriate for patients with severe ischemic coronary disease.23 This observation has some support in experimental studies of the effects of anemia in laboratory animals with coronary occlusion.24 The Canadian study has highlighted the many and complex issues involved in transfusion decision making in the ICU.",

The mean pretransfusion hemoglobin level was 8.4 g/dL. Corwin and colleagues26 studied 284 ICUs in the United States a year later and found great similarity: nearly 50% of patients received transfusions, and the mean threshold hemoglobin level was 8.6 g/dL. A single large Scottish teaching hospital reported a more parsimonious practice: the rate of transfusion was still 52% in its ICU patients, but the total volume of blood used was slightly smaller and the mean pretransfusion hemoglobin level was only 7.8 g/dL.27 All these authors have concluded that ICU practice has not fully embraced the guidelines of the Canadian clinical trial. In contrast, 18 hospitals in Australia and New Zealand have reported on transfusion in 1808 consecutive ICU admissions, and although the authors found a median pretransfusion hemoglobin concentration of 8.2 g/dL, the rate of transfusion was lower, at only 19.7% of patients, 60% of whom were bleeding.28 The \u201cinappropriate\u201d transfusion rate was 3%.

Alloimmunization is characterized by the development of anti-HLA or platelet-specific antibodies, with resultant immune platelet destruction. As many as 70% of patients receiving multiple red cell or platelet transfusions become immunized.45 Leukocyte depletion of transfused components can prevent or delay this phenomenon, but it is important to use leukoreduced components early in the course of transfusion therapy.45, 47 When patients fail to achieve expected increments after platelet transfusion, provision of ABO-specific platelet concentrates that are less than 48 hours old may improve the response. If no improvement is seen and the aforementioned medical conditions are excluded, the patient should be screened for HLA antibodies or be HLA typed and provided with HLA-compatible single-donor platelets. Alternatively, platelet crossmatching with the patient's serum can be carried out. There is no advantage to unmatched single-donor platelets in this situation.",

As little as 10% of the normal plasma concentration of several factors will effect hemostasis. Conversely, FFP treatment of acquired multiple deficiencies, as in hepatic failure, is often ineffective because many patients cannot tolerate the infusion volumes required to achieve hemostatic levels of coagulation factors, even transiently.57 The plasma half-life of transfused factor VII is only 2 to 6 hours. It may be impossible to administer sufficient FFP every few hours without encountering intravascular volume overload. Finally, in some instances, transfusion of seemingly adequate volumes may still fail to correct the coagulopathy.58 Careful documentation of both the need for FFP and the adequacy and outcomes of therapy is essential.59\n",

Clinical signs include fever, with or without chills, usually beginning 1 to 2 hours after the start of the transfusion but occasionally delayed up to 4 to 6 hours. Multiparous women and patients who are multiply transfused are particularly prone to FNHRs. The transfusion must be stopped and the appropriate transfusion reaction evaluation instituted. Antipyretics such as acetaminophen may be administered. Though commonly used, antihistamines such as diphenhydramine are neither preventive nor therapeutic. Once acute hemolysis is excluded, transfusion of a new unit may be instituted. Most patients will not experience a second such reaction.73 If repeated reactions become problematic, leukocyte-depleted blood components may be supplied. The implementation of ULR results in a reduction in the frequency of all fevers seen after transfusion by only about 12%.74\n",

Difficulties in analysis of human data arise because patients requiring blood transfusions have conditions that themselves induce immune changes. There is some evidence, bolstered by the results of two large clinical trials, to suggest that leukocyte reduction of blood components reduces or eliminates this immunosuppressive effect.90 Proponents of this viewpoint argue that for this reason, ULR would benefit most patients receiving blood transfusions and lead to fewer infections, tumor recurrences, and other related putative risks of transfusion, all potentially resulting in saving lives and cost.

Improved confidential donor screening appeared to decrease the risk of infectious units appearing in the donor pool.102, 103 The discovery that heat treatment reduced transmission resulted in a reduction in transmission by plasma products, especially to persons with hemophilia. Clinical AIDS developed in more than 90% of recipients of infected blood products, and the vast majority succumbed to the disease. Removal of donor units with seropositivity by ELISA was insufficient to prevent transmission of HIV-1; several hundred cases were reported annually after introduction of the ELISA test. Subsequent development of an assay for the p24 antigen and then NAT has lowered the risk of transfusion-associated HIV-1 infection to less than one in a million (see Table 80-3).",

This new agent was created for the treatment of hemophiliac patients with high titers of antibodies to factor VIII, which makes them unable to benefit from transfusion of recombinant factor VIII. Activated factor VII bypasses that problem by binding to tissue factor and directly activating thrombin and hence generating fibrin.117 It is extremely expensive, has a short half-life, and carries a risk of inducing pathologic thrombosis, with potentially grave consequences. Nevertheless, in numerous case reports, this new agent appears to potentially be beneficial if used early in the resuscitation of massively injured patients. Unfortunately, its unsupervised use has also resulted in thrombotic complications and relative lack of success, both of which suggest that carefully controlled clinical trials are appropriate.118\n",

If the hemolysis is brisk, patients may require red cell transfusion to support oxygen needs before medical management of the AIHA is effective. Hence, transfusion is difficult because agglutination during crossmatching interferes with proper definition of compatible units of RBCs and because the transfused RBCs are themselves subject to the same immune hemolysis as the host RBCs. Many blood banks have methods for depletion of autoantibodies from the recipient's plasma and elution of antibodies from RBCs to arrive at a proper crossmatch.127 Although such crossmatches are time consuming and not generally available on an emergency basis, they can be lifesaving.

Generally, alloimmunization occurs in approximately 1% of transfusions,68 but the prevalence of alloantibodies is higher in chronically transfused, relatively immunocompetent patients, especially African Americans, whose distribution of red cell antigens has significant variation from the white population. Alloimmunization rates of 30% or higher may be found in chronically transfused patients with hemoglobinopathies who have not received RBCs matched to potent minor antigens such as Kell, Duffy, and Lewis. Alloimmunization may present difficulties in crossmatching of blood, to the point that compatible blood must be obtained from rare-donor registries, if at all. Other patients present unresolved serologic problems in that the alloantibody is never precisely identified yet the majority of blood available for transfusion is incompatible. The delay engendered by working with multiple or unidentified antibodies may be unacceptable in some critical care situations in which the need for oxygen-carrying capacity leaves no choice but to transfuse incompatible blood. The behavior of these antibodies in the laboratory may assist in predicting the clinical outcome of the incompatible transfusion.128 Special procedures such as clearance studies,129 flow cytometry130 and in vivo crossmatching (cautious administration of a small aliquot of blood, with subsequent observation of serum and urine for evidence of hemolysis) are useful if time permits.",

A blood bank problem uniquely encountered in BMT is the need to switch the patient's ABO group because of an ABO-mismatched transplant, thus necessitating an exchange transfusion of red cells and plasma-containing products (i.e., platelet concentrates) of differing ABO type to avoid hemolysis of donor and recipient cells. BMT patients may also manifest an increased rate of delayed hemolytic reactions139 as donor \u201cpassenger\u201d lymphocytes recognize recipient or transfused red cell antigens.

Two or three volume exchanges remove 87% and 95%, respectively. Highly protein-bound, intravascularly concentrated substances are most efficiently removed, whereas substances with a large volume of distribution such as IgG, active synthesis, or large extravascular stores are removed at less than predicted rates. The usual short-term intense course of PE schedules five one-volume exchanges (approximately 3 L in normal-sized adults) over a 7-day period.

Appropriate blood component therapy requires that the specific blood product needed for a clear indication be prescribed, with avoidance of a formulaic approach.\u25aaRed blood cells should be transfused only to increase oxygen-carrying capacity. Transfusion decisions should be based on individual patient physiology. The majority of patients with hemoglobin levels greater than 60 or 70 g/L will not require transfusion unless they have limited cardiopulmonary reserve or active bleeding.\u25aaPlatelet transfusions are indicated for patients who are bleeding because of thrombocytopenia or functional platelet defects. Guidelines for platelet transfusion are also conservative. Prophylactic platelet transfusion remains controversial and is not warranted in many situations.\u25aaFresh frozen plasma is indicated for the repletion of coagulation factors in bleeding patients deficient in those factors or to provide specific plasma proteins that cannot be obtained from safer sources.\u25aaCryoprecipitate is a concentrated source of fibrinogen and selected coagulation factors. Cryoprecipitate may be more helpful in correcting the hypofibrinogenemia of dilutional or consumptive coagulopathy than fresh frozen plasma.\u25aaAdverse reactions to blood components occur in 1% to 2% of transfusion episodes. Adherence to routine protocols for the evaluation of transfusion reactions may save lives.\u25aaAcute hemolytic reactions are the leading cause of immediate transfusion fatalities. Prevention of these reactions requires strict adherence to transfusion and patient identification procedures.\u25aaTransmission of infectious agents by transfusion has been markedly reduced, and bacterial infection is now the most common infectious complication of transfusion.\u25aaAdverse effects unique to massive transfusion are likely to occur in the ICU and complicate the management of critically ill or severely injured patients. Component therapy for such patients should remain conservative. The emerging role of activated factor VII in the treatment of these patients requires further evaluation.\u25aaInformed consent for blood transfusion is a standard of practice. A competent adult has the legal right to refuse blood transfusion. Consent in critically ill patients remains subject to individual institution policies.\n\n",
