The Chordopoxvirinae is further divided into ten genera: nine mammalian genera and the Avipoxvirus genus, subject of the present study (Haller et al., 2014, Virus Taxonomy, 2013). Based on basic genomic analyses (restriction fragment length polymorphism), avipoxviruses (APV) are currently divided into ten virus species (http://ictvonline.org/) but more recent phylogenetic studies identified three major clades: canarypox-like viruses, fowlpox-like viruses, and psittacinepox-like viruses (Jarmin et al., 2006).",

Genus taxonomy had been based on this concept until recent studies showed that Otididae, Columbidae and Accipitridae can be infected by a large diversity of strains (Abdallah and Hassanin, 2013, Gyuranecz et al., 2013, Jarmin et al., 2006, Le Loc\u2019h et al., 2014). The age of divergence between the three main APV clades has not been estimated. So far, only three genes have been widely studied: fpv094/cnpv121 (locus P4b, hereafter \u201cP4b\u201d), fpv140/cnpv186 (hereafter \u201ccnpv186\u201d) and fpv167/cnpv240 (hereafter \u201cDNA polymerase\u201d) (Gyuranecz et al., 2013, Jarmin et al., 2006, Le Loc\u2019h et al., 2014). Besides, only four APV have been fully sequenced: one Fowlpox virus (Afonso et al., 2000), one Pigeonpox virus, one Penguinpox virus (Offerman et al., 2014), and one Canarypox virus (Tulman et al., 2004). Their analyses have shown large genomic rearrangements and suggest significant genomic diversity among APV.",

Although this codivergence seems more likely in the case of papillomaviruses (millions of years of association, (Bernard et al., 2006)), it is less probable or at least more recent in the case of newly emerging viruses (e.g. the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus evolution (Peiris et al., 2004)). The literature suggests that a short sampling time interval (as compared to the real evolution timescale) biases the calculations (Ho et al., 2007).",

The sampling date (at least year, month and day when available) was collected for each sequence. In case no information was available, the 1st of July of the year of sequence publication was then considered as sample collection date. Only the oldest sequence was kept when identical sequences were available. Table 1\nsummarizes the details of included APV sequences. For each gene, DNA sequences were translated to amino acid (aa) sequences using BioEdit 7.2.5 (Hall, 1999), the aa sequences were aligned with ClustalX 2.1 (Larkin et al., 2007), and the original BioEdit format aa sequences were aligned with the ClustalX aa aligned sequences before they were reverse-translated in an aligned nucleotide file using BioEdit. The sequence of the APV pigeon/CAPM V-101/CZE/1965 P4b gene (accession number: GU982736) was removed due to many deletions resulting in non-functional short proteins; the P4b sequences of APV isolates from Hawaii EL1.1H1900, APAP16.2H03, and HAAMB.07H02 (accession numbers EF568402 to EF568404) were also removed because they were too short (116 bp). In order to exclude recombinant sequences (as done in Firth et al., 2010) which can bias the calculation, possible recombinant sequences were searched with the Recombinant Identification Program (RIP) (www.hiv.lanl.gov). None were identified. Overall, we analyzed 81 P4b gene sequences (partial open reading frame, ORF: 426 nucleotides) from specimens collected between 1865 and 2014; 31 cnpv186 genes (complete ORF: 933 to 1020 nucleotides) from specimens collected between 1965 and 2014; and 47 DNA polymerase genes (partial ORF: 555 nucleotides) from specimens collected between 1980 and 2014 (Table 1).",

We used empirical base frequencies and three partitions into codon positions. Different combinations of demographic models and clock models were compared as suggested (Drummond and Rambaut, 2007): constant size or extended Bayesian skyline plot models, strict or relaxed (lognormal or exponential) clocks. At least 200 million MCMC iterations were run for each gene and each demographic model/clock model combination. Subsampling was performed every 10,000 generations to decrease autocorrelation between model parameter samples. The estimation of parameters and divergence time was carried out using Tracer (http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/Tracer). A correct mixing of MCMC was verified by effective sampling size (ESS) calculations available in Tracer. The best fitting model was also assessed using \u201cModel Comparison\u201d available in Tracer and choosing the lowest Akaike\u2019s information criterion (AICM) value. The dN/dS ratios (\u03c9) were calculated using the single-likelihood ancestor (SLAC) method available in the HyPhy package available on the http://www.datamonkey.org/ server (Kosakovsky Pond, 2005, Kosakovsky Pond and Frost, 2005).",

To assess both substitution rate per site per year and TMRCA, different combinations of demographic models and clock models were compared: constant size or extended Bayesian skyline plot models, strict or relaxed (lognormal or exponential) clocks. The lowest AICM values were obtained with a relaxed exponential clock and the extended Bayesian skyline plot model for both cnpv186 and the DNA polymerase genes (AICM values of 11,673.74 \u00b1 0.11 standard error (SE) and 7,316.26 \u00b1 0.12 SE for cnpv186 and DNA polymerase genes, respectively, Table 2\n). For the P4b gene, the AICM value was slightly lower with a strict clock and the Extended Bayesian Skyline Plot model than with a relaxed exponential clock and the extended Bayesian skyline plot model (AICM values of 8,492.42 \u00b1 0.21 SE and 8,493.49 \u00b1 0.44 SE, respectively). We however decided to use the same combination for our three genes for consistency: a relaxed exponential clock and the extended Bayesian skyline plot model (Table 2). Analyses were also performed using the General Time Reversible substitution model with gamma-distributed rate and invariant sites (GTR + G + I, best fitted model as per MrModeltest), which gave similar results (data not shown).",

DNA polymerase encodes a polymerase protein, cnpv186 an immunodominant protein, and P4b a core protein (Tulman et al., 2004). The slower evolution rate of P4b is therefore somewhat surprising: while viable DNA polymerase and cnpv186 mutants may be more difficult to generate, one could expect more flexibility on a core protein. The selection pressure may however be lower on P4b than on its counterparts. Esposito et al. showed that the genes coding for host range and virulence proteins vary the most for Smallpox Virus compared to genes involved in virus replication, suggesting that these genes are most targeted by selection pressure (Esposito, 2006). But the large confidence intervals (95% HPD) associated with the values we found (within the range of what had been calculated in previous studies) does not show a statistically significant difference (Table 2). Therefore, it is not possible to draw any conclusion. In addition, our analysis has a bias as it was carried out on three genes only: a very small fragment of avipoxvirus genomes (260\u2013306 kbp). Cnpv186, P4b and DNA polymerase genes were selected on the basis of available sequence data but might have a substitution rate different from the rest of the avipoxvirus genome. The molecular clock analyses of avipoxviruses will gain in precision when more sequence data (and more full genomes) become available. To run the analyses with as much data as possible, we extrapolated sampling years for some sequences. This also represents a bias. When excluding the sequence data for which no collection year was available, the substitution rates and TMRCA results for P4b and DNA polymerase genes were almost unchanged, but cnpv186 gene had a tenfold lower calculated substitution rate and a TMRCA of 2,274 years only.",

They observed positive selection for genes involved in virulence or for gene candidates for host\u2013pathogen interaction (McLysaght et al., 2003). Indeed, positive selection of viruses could also contribute to an increase of substitution rate, which can be observed either for viruses inducing a strong host immune response or for those which have been the object of vaccination or intervention campaigns (Firth et al., 2010). While the houbara bustards we focus on in our projects in Morocco, the United Arab Emirates, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are vaccinated annually (Le Loc\u2019h et al., 2015), APV vaccination is not systematic worldwide, thus making selection pressure assessment difficult. Our selection pressure analyses demonstrated a purifying selection of the three APV genes we studied with \u03c9 values ranging between 0.065 and 0.200, suggesting that a non-synonymous mutation has only 7\u201320% as much chance as a synonymous mutation of being fixed in the population. This finding might correlate with relatively weak vaccination/intervention pressure and may be linked with the low host specificity of avipoxviruses. Vaccination is likely not the sole factor driving potential selection pressure and ecological and epidemiological factors should be further investigated for a proper understanding of the observed selection phenomenon.",

In addition, it was shown that molecular evolution is artificially accelerated on short timescales (Ho et al., 2007). Indeed our datasets contain very recent sequences only (from 1865 to now) compared to the TMCRA of APV. Hence our results should be considered with caution. But Babkin and Shchelkunov estimated that Poxviridae evolve at a rate of 0.9\u20131.2 \u00d7 10\u20136\n substitutions/site/year. They calculated the ancestors of poxviruses, orthopoxviruses, and modern poxvirus species dated approximately 500,000, 300,000, and 14,000 years, respectively (Babkin and Shchelkunov, 2006). The evolution rate of APV estimated in the present study is therefore within the range of what was observed for poxviruses. The divergence between APV clades (canarypox-like viruses, fowlpox-like viruses, and psittacinepox-like viruses) is as old as the divergence among modern poxvirus species. Our results therefore suggest that APV may keep their \u201cGenus\u201d classification and not become a sub-family as proposed in the past (Jarmin et al., 2006), even if taxonomic classifications could not be based solely on the time of divergence. In addition, when Firth et al. tried to account for the specificity of double stranded DNA genomes in evolution calculations, their most robust virus model (with the different clock and demographic models tested) was Variola virus, suggesting that heterochronous phylogenetic modeling may be used for poxviruses evolution calculations (Firth et al., 2010). They however emphasized that the TMRCA calculated for Variola virus based on the high substitution rates observed were likely erroneous. Our TMRCA values should really be considered as first estimates and not overinterpretated.",
