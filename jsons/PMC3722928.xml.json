The direct lung injury type of ARDS was reported to occur during infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus 3 or the highly pathogenic avian influenza A/H5N1 virus 4,5, and following chemical or physical hazards such as bronchial aspiration of gastric contents or drowning 6. The serum levels of interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and interleukin (IL)-6 were elevated in fatal human A/H5N1 influenza virus infections 7, and several cytokine and chemokine levels including TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-8 were increased in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids in cases of acute-phase ARDS 8\u201310.",

Recently, we reported an animal model of severe ARDS that was established by sensitizing mice with \u03b1-galactosylceramide (\u03b1-GalCer), a potent activator of natural killer T (NK T) cells, followed by a challenge with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 13. In this model, all mice died rapidly and had diffuse alveolar damage in their lungs, which was accompanied by a large increase in IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 production.",

We also questioned whether or not rTM treatment improved the inflammatory response and clinical course in ARDS mice and, if so, how Treg cells contributed to the beneficial effect of this treatment. To address the hypothesis and questions, we examined the kinetics of HMGB1 secretion in the BAL fluids and assessed histologically the localization of HMGB1-expressing cells in the lungs of ARDS mice. We also examined the effect of rTM treatment on the survival and inflammatory responses in these mice. We found that pulmonary HMGB1 levels increased more in ARDS mice than in mice treated with LPS alone, and that rTM administration ameliorated the development of this pathological condition through increasing CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Treg cells in the lungs of ARDS mice.",

In the present study, HMGB1 levels in BAL fluids were higher in ARDS mice than those in mice with ALI caused by LPS alone, suggesting that robust secretion of HMGB1 may contribute to the severe lung injury and fatal outcome. It is known that activated NK T cells rapidly produce a large amount of IFN-\u03b3 39\u201341. Recently, we have shown that IFN-\u03b3 is secreted by NK T cells and that it plays a critical role during the development of severe lung injury in our model 13. In addition, IFN-\u03b3 was reported to induce HMGB1 release in in-vitro experiments 42. Thus, IFN-\u03b3 secreted by NK T cells may be an upstream mediator of HMGB1 release. In agreement with this possibility, our results showed that a large amount of IFN-\u03b3 was secreted in the lungs before HMGB1 levels increased in \u03b1-GalCer/LPS-treated mice compared to mice in other groups, and HMGB1 release was reduced to the basal level in NK T cell-deficient mice.",

In the present study, the proportion of Treg cells in the lungs was significantly lower in severe ARDS mice compared to that in mice treated with LPS alone as early as 6 h after exposure to LPS, and rTM increased Treg cells in the lungs of severe ARDS mice. Thus, these results strongly support the possible involvement of Treg cells in determining the outcome of lung injury; reduced Treg cells lead to development of severe ARDS, whereas such severe lung injury is ameliorated with an increased proportion of Treg cells. The increased level of Treg cells was detected at an innate phase of the immune response, suggesting the involvement of natural Treg cells 47,48 rather than induced Treg cells, which are developed from naive T cells upon antigenic stimulation 48, in the pathogenic mechanism of severe ARDS.

            "text": "In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that BAL fluid levels of HMGB1 secreted from the inflammatory leucocytes were associated with the severity of lung injury and that administration of rTM showed clinical effects protecting ARDS mice from severe lung injury and fatal outcome, which was associated with a reversal of the reduced Treg cell accumulation and ameliorated production of IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 in the lungs. These findings provide important information for the development of a novel therapeutic strategy through manipulating Treg cells in human ARDS, which has a high mortality rate in hospital intensive care units, and limited available therapeutic agents. However, the precise mechanism of how HMGB1 and Treg cells are involved in the progress of severe lung injury in ARDS has not yet been determined. Moreover, in clinical settings, patients with severe ARDS must receive proper treatments, including drugs and mechanical ventilation, which will affect the pathological condition; without these treatments the animal model may not reflect the pathological mechanism accurately. Further research with a focus on this issue is necessary for translating them into practical medicine.",
