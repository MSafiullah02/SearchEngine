FCV infections are associated with a range of clinical syndromes. They can be clinically inapparent or be seen as relatively mild oral and upper respiratory tract disease, with or without acute polyarthritis. Less commonly, sudden death, ulcerative dermatitis, limping, abortion, jaundice and severe pneumonia can occur (Greene, 2006). FCV has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of the feline chronic gingivo-stomatitis complex (FCGS), but its role remains uncertain (Knowles et al., 1991).",

Outbreaks have been associated with a high mortality rate (up to 50%); besides upper respiratory tract disease, affected cats showed a range of clinical signs of variable severity, including fever, cutaneous oedema, ulcerative dermatitis, anorexia and jaundice. VSD, initially termed haemorrhagic-like fever, shares some features with rabbit haemorrhagic disease caused by another calicivirus, the Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease Virus (RHDV). FCV-VSD strains are described as highly contagious, with marked tropism for endothelial and epithelial cells of the skin and parenchymal organs which explains the clinical manifestation of the disease. Adult cats are often more severely affected than kittens, and vaccination does not prevent VSD.",

The severe clinical course is typical and the pathological findings are within the reported scope.

Damage to these cells in various organs can be regarded as the cause for the range of changes observed in the present case: ulcerative glossitis, liver necrosis with haemoperitoneum and multifocal haemorrhage. Calicivirus infection was definitively confirmed by virus isolation and real-time PCR not only in the diseased cat \u201cOscar\u201d, but also in asymptomatic cats that lived in direct contact with him, confirming the presence of FCV in the shelter and its maintenance in the environment by carriers cats (Wardley, 1976).",

            "text": "It is generally speculated that genetic differences between FCV strains of low and high virulence account for the presence of local mild FCV infection or systemic infection in affected cats. Mutations within the viral genome may be responsible for the highly virulent phenotype. Since the FCV strains isolated in each outbreak of VSD were genetically distinct from each other, if viral mutations are required to cause the hyper-virulent phenotype, they must evolve independently in each outbreak. To our knowledge, no specific genetic markers for an increase in virulence have been identified, although previous reports showed that sequence differences in HVR_E lead to the acquisition of an additional glycosylation site in some VSD isolates (Foley et al., 2006, Abd-Eldaim et al., 2005). Changes in the glycosylation pattern of viral proteins could affect the host-virus interactions and represent a mechanism for immune evasion, as reported for other viruses, such as influenza virus (Vigerust and Sheperd, 2007). In the present study, we could identify only one additional glycosylation site in the 5\u2032 HVR_E sequences, in the Asn-459 residue, in all FCV isolates, but observed a high diversity in the 5\u2032 HVR_E region, which allowed the distinction between FCV isolated from the cat with VSD and asymptomatic cats in the present study. Although these mutations do not affect the viral glycosylation pattern, they might modify the antigenic profile of the HVR_E. The capsid protein of FCV is an important target for the immune response and molecular studies have mapped antigenic epitopes located in the HVR_E (Radford et al., 1999, Geissler et al., 2002). Since these amino acid differences occurred in a putatively neutralising region of HVR_E, the underlying mutations might represent a mechanism for FCV immune evasion and possibly also differences in viral pathogenicity (Henzel et al., 2012). The results of our phylogenetic analyses showed that clustering of reference viruses occurs independent of clinical signs; in particular VS-FCV associated with haemorrhagic disease are spread over different lineages of the phylogenetic tree. This result support the hypothesis of Hurley et al. (2004) who suggested that VSD can be associated with a range of FCV genotypes.",
