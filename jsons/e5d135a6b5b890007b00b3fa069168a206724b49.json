With the termination in 1969 of the longitudinal Junior Village study of infants and young children, which for 15 years had encompassed each of these goals, the emphasis of the Epidemiology Section of the LID turned to the study of the etiology of acute nonbacterial (viral) gastroenteritis. The Junior Village study generated seminal information on the epidemiology of respiratory and enteric infections and led to the discovery of many respiratory and enteric viruses [1] . Although nonbacterial diarrheal illnesses had occurred frequently in this study and many enteric viruses were readily recovered in tissue culture, none emerged as etiologic agents of diarrhea. The search for a viral etiologic agent for acute gastroenteritis began in the late 1960s and was intensified in the early 1970s. The search for a viral agent was based on the rationale that (1) the etiology of most episodes of infectious gastroenteritis among pediatric and adult populations was unknown [2, 3] ; (2) it was assumed that viruses were important in these outbreaks because bacteria were associated etiologically only infrequently [2, 3] ; (3) bacteria-free stool filtrates induced gastroenteritis in adult volunteer studies [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] ; and (4) new techniques, such as organ culture, that might enable the cultivation of a fastidious etiologic agent had become available.",

[4] induced gastroenteritis by administering aerosolized bacteria-free throat washings or fecal suspensions from persons in a gastroenteritis outbreak. Gordon et al. [5] induced an afebrile diarrheal illness following oral administration of pooled bacteria-free fecal filtrates or throat washings from patients in an outbreak at Marcy State Hospital (located near Utica, NY). This agent, the Marcy strain, was passaged serially seven additional times in volun-teers [5] [6] [7] [8] . Short-term (several weeks) and longer-term (9-15 months) immunity was described in rechallenge studies [5] [6] [7] [8] .",

These included the use of human embryonic nasal or tracheal organ culture, which preserved cells in their normal state of differentiation and architecture. Organ culture was used successfully for the discovery of several new respiratory coronaviruses that did not grow in conventional tissue cultures [13, 14] . The success in growing fastidious coronaviruses in organ culture stimulated renewed efforts to cultivate the elusive agents of \"viral\" gastroenteritis; human fetal intestinal organ cultures were established in an effort to find a method to support the growth of a heretofore noncultivatable gastroenteritis virus [15, 16] . However, the organ culture technique (as well as standard tissue-culture techniques) also failed to yield an etiologic agent [17] . Although the study specimens that were tested were derived from individuals with nonbacterial gastroenteritis, there was no practical way of knowing whether they contained infectious material that was capable of producing disease. It was possible that the inability to detect a virus resulted from the absence of an infectious agent in the test specimen. Fecal specimens of known infectivity from early volunteer studies described above could not be accessed because they were either not available at the time or had been exhausted.",

In 1970, fecal filtrates from four separate gastroenteritis outbreaks were studied in groups of 3-4 volunteers [18] . One of the four outbreaks took place in an elementary school in Norwalk, Ohio, in October 1968, and was investigated by the Centers for Disease Control [20] . During a 2-day period, 50% of the students and teachers (116/232) developed a gastrointestinal illness, and there was a secondary attack rate of 32% among contacts of primary cases. The incubation period was \u223c48 h, and the illness, which lasted \u223c24 h, was described as \"winter vomiting disease\" because it was reminiscent of the syndrome first described by Zahorsky in 1929 [21] . Indeed, the prominent clinical manifestations in the Norwalk outbreak were vomiting and nausea, although some of the patients developed diarrhea. Laboratory studies did not reveal an etiologic agent.",

This technique, a method defined as the direct observation of antigen-antibody interaction [23] , was not new-it had been described in 1941 in studies with tobacco mosaic virus [24, 25] . Even with the development of electron microscopes with increased resolving power and the introduction of negative-staining techniques, which greatly enhanced contrast, thus facilitating the recognition of viruses [26] , the application of IEM was underutilized. We examined human coronaviruses by IEM to visualize the formation of complement holes in the envelope following incubation with uninactivated serum, as previously described for an avian coronavirus [23] . We also examined rhinovirus preparations by IEM in an attempt to visualize these 27-nm viruses clearly because they did not grow to high titer, were of rather small size (even for a virus), and did not have a distinctive morphologic appearance [27] .",

The mixture was then centrifuged, and the pellet was reconstituted with distilled water and stained with phosphotungstic acid [27] . Examination of the control preparation revealed scattered, randomly distributed, 27-nm particles, some of which could not be identified conclusively as a virus (figure 1). However, in the virus-serum preparation, the 27-nm rhinovirus particles were no longer randomly distributed but appeared in the form of large and small aggregates coated with antibody and standing out clearly from the background, leaving no doubt that they were virus particles (figure 2). These observations had a major impact on the course of my future research as I realized that IEM might enable the detection of fastidious viruses that do not grow in tissue culture. Key to this concept was the realization that although hyperimmune serum would not be available for enabling the detection of a noncultivatable unknown agent, convalescent sera could be used for screening as it would provide the specificity needed to detect a putative viral agent.",

In June 1972, almost 20 months after beginning such studies, I examined a Norwalk agent stool filtrate (designated 8FIIa) derived from a volunteer who became ill after oral administration of the Norwalk agent [31] . This filtrate was known to contain an infectious agent because it had induced a diarrheal illness in 6 of 10 volunteers. Following incubation of the stool filtrate with a volunteer's convalescent serum and further preparation for electron microscopy, glistening aggregates of nonenveloped, antibody-coated 27-nm, virus-like particles, which resembled rhinoviruses, were visualized. A characteristic aggregate observed in early experiments is shown in figure 3A . The visualization of virus-like particles was very promising, but it was clear that further studies were needed to determine the significance of this finding.

We found that 3 of the 5 individuals who had become ill developed a significant antibody response to the 27-nm Norwalk particle. The 2 who did not develop such a response had a high level of antibody to the 27-nm particle in both acute and convalescent sera, most likely a reflection of the time of acquisition of the acute phase sera, probably several days after the onset of disease. In addition, the contact who did not become ill did not develop a seroresponse. The demonstration of an antibody response in 3 of 5 individuals who developed illness under natural conditions, independently of the responses observed in the challenged volunteers, was a major link in establishing the chain of causation. One of the 3 (\"J\") who developed a seroresponse was the donor of the orig- inal rectal swab specimen from which the 27-nm particle was derived. In addition, 1 of the 2 volunteers who became ill after challenge with the original rectal swab specimen developed a seroresponse and the other did not (data not shown) [31] . Although the evidence for an etiologic association was becoming quite convincing, there was an additional obstacle to consider. Was it possible that gastroenteritis induced a nonspecific antibody response, thereby negating the presumed importance of demonstrating a seroresponse to the 27-nm particle under experimental and natural conditions? We examined this possibility by examining serum specimens from volunteers who had become ill after challenge with stool filtrates derived from other outbreaks of gastroenteritis not related to the Norwalk outbreak-one in Hawaii and the other in Maryland (Montgomery County). We tested sequential sera from 2 volunteers who underwent three successive challenges. The first volunteer was challenged three times-the first and second times with the Hawaii agent and a third time with the Norwalk agent. This volunteer became ill after the first and third challenges, sug-gesting that the Hawaii and Norwalk agents were unrelated. Examination of 5 sequential serum samples by IEM revealed that this volunteer did not develop a seroresponse to the Norwalk virus after the first or second challenge with the Hawaii agent but did develop a seroresponse to the Norwalk virus after the third challenge [31] .",

This volunteer became ill after the first and third challenges also. Five sequential sera were tested by IEM as above. The volunteer developed a significant antibody response to the Norwalk virus after the first challenge but not after the second and developed a further increase in antibody to the Norwalk virus after the third challenge. The Norwalk virus and the Maryland agent appeared to be antigenically related. Thus, it appeared from these sequential challenges that antibody responses detected to the 27-nm Norwalk particle after experimentally or naturally induced infection were specific [31] . 2\u03e9 Contact who did not become ill (Norwalk outbreak) K 1 \u03e9 0 NOTE. Amount of antibody that coated particles was rated on 0-4\u03e9 scale, with 4\u03e9 being very heavy coating (almost obscuring particle), and 3\u03e9, 2\u03e9, or 1\u03e9 indicating lesser amounts of antibody. Difference of 1\u03e9 in antibody rating was significant seroresponse. Adapted from Kapikian et al. [31] . Figure 4 . Aggregate observed after incubation of 0.8 mL of Norwalk stool filtrate with 0.2 mL of 1 : 5 dilution of volunteer's prechallenge serum and further preparation for electron microscopy. Volunteer developed gastroenteritis after challenge with 2d-passage Norwalk filtrate, which had been heated for 30 min at 60\u040aC [22] . Quantity of antibody on particles in this aggregate was rated 1-2-2\u03e9, and prechallenge serum was given overall rating of 1-2\u03e9. Bar = 100 nm and applies to entire figure. B, Single particle. C, 3 single particles observed after incubating 0.8 mL of Norwalk stool filtrate with 0.2 mL of 1 : 5 dilution of same volunteer's convalescent serum and further preparation for electron microscopy. These particles are heavily coated with antibody. Quantity of antibody on these particles was rated 4\u03e9, and serum was given overall rating of 4\u03e9 also. Difference in quantity of antibody coating particles in prechallenge and postchallenge sera is clearly evident. (From Kapikian et al. [30] , bar added.) Because of the evidence outlined above, we were satisfied that the major obstacles to establishing an etiologic association between the Norwalk virus particle and the Norwalk outbreak had been addressed. Thus, we stated in our abstract of the original report that \"A 27 nm particle was observed by immune electron microscopy in an infectious stool filtrate derived from an outbreak in Norwalk, Ohio, of acute infectious nonbacterial gastroenteritis. Both experimentally and naturally infected individuals developed serological evidence of infection; this along with other evidence suggested that the particle was the etiological agent of Norwalk gastroenteritis\" [31] .",

For example, the density of the virus in CsCl [32] and the pattern of virus shedding during illness [33] was determined. In addition, IEM was used for the discovery of other 27-nm gastroenteritis vi-ruses, such as the Hawaii virus in 1977 [34] and the Snow Mountain virus in 1982 [35] . Moreover, in 1973, with a similar type of analysis, IEM was key for the discovery of the 27-nm hepatitis A virus [36] . Later, shortly after the discovery of rotavirus in Australia [37] , IEM was used to detect antibody responses to the 70-nm rotaviruses in infants hospitalized with diarrhea [38] . The technique of IEM, which has been so important in the study of gastroenteritis and hepatitis viruses, holds promise in the future to help elucidate the cause of diseases of unknown etiology including a substantial portion of diarrheal episodes [39] .",
