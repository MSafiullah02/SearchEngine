Further modification on the heterocyclic rings may sometimes be used on a preformed acyclonucleoside. Thus, the chloromethyl ether 266 was prepared from epichlorohydrin (264) by treatment with benzyl alcohol and aqueous NaOH to give 1,3-di-O-benzylglycerol 265\n(83JMC759). Alternatively, 265 was prepared from 1,3-dichloro-2-hydroxypropane 268\n(84CJC241). Chloromethylation of 265 gave 266, whose treatment with potassium acetate gave 2-O-(acetoxymethyl)-1, 3-di-O-benzylglycerol (267) (83JMC759). The choice of the hydroxy protecting groups must be made to avoid difficulties encountered with the removal of the benzyl groups during the subsequent steps, particularly in the cytosine series. Thus, the requisite acyclic chain 272 was prepared by commencing with 1,3-dichloro-2-propanol 268. Methoxymethylation of 268 gave 269, where this group served a dual purpose. It protected that position from a trans-acylation process in the subsequent step and furnished the backbone methyleneoxy unit whose methoxy group could be converted into the most suitable leaving group. Treatment of 269 with the desired acid salt in DMF gave 270, whose acetolysis gave 271, which converted it to the bromomethylester 272\n(88JMC144).",

Both mercuric cyanide and tetra-n-butylammonium iodide (TBAI) were frequently used as catalysts in the coupling reactions. The latter catalyst has the advantages that it is less toxic, is required in smaller quantities, and involves reactions that are generally easier to manipulate during workup. Lithium bromide/ TFA/MeCN was also used (88MI2). In the case of triazine derivatives, in addition to the major product, a minor quantity of the 4-alkylated isomer was obtained (91MI5). Direct or phase catalytic, hydrogenation of 273 gave 274, except in the presence of a halogen or nitro group when boron trichloride was used 84CJC16, 84CJC241, 85JMC358, 85JMC971, 87MI2, 93MI1. Attempted debenzylation with BBr3 gave a 2-methoxymethyl derivative because of complex formation between BBr3 and the C-2 oxygen. Nucleophilic substitution may have occurred at C-1\u2032 (N \u2014 CH2 \u2014 O) when the complex was quenched by the addition of MeOH (91MI5). However, the chlorine atom in position 6 of 6-chloro-Pu and 6-chloro-Gu could be hydrogenolyzed without any significant loss of the benzyl groups (84-CJC241).",

Treatment of compound 366 with sodium methoxide resulted in an internal SN2 displacement reaction, yielding (R)-benzyl-2,3-epoxypropyl ether 367 with inversion of configuration at carbon-2. Ring opening of the epoxide 367 with lithium azide afforded the other desired intermediate (S)-azido enantiomer 368.

Acetyl groups were subsequently removed from most of the protected analogs by treatment with ammonia in aqueous methanol, except in the case of 5-trifluoromethyluracil, which gave the 5-cyano derivative. Because fluoride ion is normally a poor leaving group in displacement and elimination reactions, direct displacement of fluoride by ammonia seemed unlikely, and a more plausible mechanism for this transformation involved initial attack of ammonia at C-6. 2,3-Bis(trimethylsilyloxy)-1,1-dimethoxypropane was used where subsequent removal of the O-trimethylsilyl groups under neutral aqueous conditions was required. Under the reaction conditions employed, condensation of bis-O-trimethylsilyl-5-nitrouracil and N,O-bis-trimethylsilyl-N-acetylcytosine with 1,3-diacetoxy-1-methoxypropane afforded, not only the 1-N alkylated products, but also the 1,3-disubstituted pyrimidines. The activity of these acyclonucleosides was studied toward influenza A, parainfluenza type 1, and herpes simplex type 1 viruses.",
