The most common symptoms are dyspnoea and a dry non-productive cough. High fever (the most common initial symptom of COVID-19) frequently occurs in patients presenting severe lung RP. No laboratory test can definitively identify RP. However, most patients will have a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (VES) or C-reactive protein and normal procalcitonin. Furthermore, high serum ferritin and D-Dimer are elevated in these patients due to cancer disease (5, 6) . In addition, lymphopenia (the most common laboratory finding in patients diagnosed with COVID-19) can be relatively frequent in RP as lymphocytes are known to be more radiosensitive and lymphocyte count reduction has been reported by a median of 67% in NSCLC patients undergoing CCRT (7).",

Firstly, acute symptomatic RP usually occurs within 3 months from the end of radiotherapy. In the Pacific trial in the placebo group, the median time to the onset of RP was 76.5 days (10) . Therefore, an interstitial pneumonia with high fever occurring several months after radiotherapy is unlikely to be radiation induced. Secondly, RP is usually unilateral and the distribution of chest CT abnormalities correspond to radiation treatment fields. It can, therefore, be helpful to correlate CT abnormalities with volumes of treatment and distribution of different doses to lungs. Thirdly, the onset of symptomatic RP is slower than COVID-19 disease, which can show an unfavourable clinical course with the onset of dyspnoea within 5 days and ARDS within 8 days (2).",
