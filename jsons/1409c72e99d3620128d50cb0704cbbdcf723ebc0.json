Lacking an effective vaccine or proven, pharmaceutical therapy, countries have enacted an unprecedented series of non-pharmaceutical interventions to combat this disease. However, the potential for variation in free-living virus survival to modulate the efficacy of these interventions remains unclear. Using an empirically determined understanding of SARS-CoV-2 natural history and detailed, country-level case data, we elucidate how variation in free-living virus survival influences key features of COVID-19 epidemics. Our findings suggest that COVID-19's basic reproductive number (\u211b0) and other key signatures of outbreak intensity are modulated by transmission between infected individuals and the environment. In addition, country-level outbreaks vary in the degree to which environmental transmission appears to modulate COVID-19 dynamics. Summarizing, we propose that informed models of \"sit and wait,\" environmental transmission are essential in emerging outbreaks, as they highlight how variation in environmental transmission may explain observed differences in disease dynamics from setting to setting, and can inform public health interventions.",

This framework includes parameters corresponding to the transmission of the virus from both presymptomatic/asymptomatic and clinical (symptomatic) carriers of SARS-CoV-2, and the possibility that susceptible hosts can acquire infection through environmental reservoirs. We examine how outbreak dynamics are influenced by differences in SARS-CoV-2 free-living survival that include values corresponding to empirical values for survival on various abiotic surfaces (e.g. plastic, copper, steel, cardboard) (12) .",

Specifically, we propose that environmental transmission-including the particulars of how free-living virus survives on different abiotic surfaces-should be a greater focus in emerging infectious disease outbreaks, as undertreatment of this route can obfuscate essential properties of how the disease is spreading and potential avenues for intervention.",

For example, models have been used to investigate the role of social distancing (2, 15) , social mixing (16) , the importance of undocumented infections (17) , the role of mobility in the early spread of disease in China (18) , and the potential for contact tracing as a solution (19) . Only a few notable models of SARS-CoV-2 transmission incorporate features of indirect or environmental transmission (13) (14) 19) , and none consider the dynamical properties of viral free-living survival in the environment. Such a model structure would provide an avenue towards exploring how variation in free-living survival influences disease outbreaks. Environmental transmission models are aplenty in the literature and serve as a theoretical foundation for exploring similar concepts in SARS-CoV-2 transmission (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) .",

Our model also deviates from the traditional SEIR form by splitting the infectious compartment into an IA-compartment (A for asymptomatic), and an IS-compartment (S for symptomatic). The former represents an initial infectious stage (following the non-infectious, exposed stage), from which individuals will either move on to recovery directly (representing those individuals who experienced mild to no symptoms) or move on to the IS-compartment (representing those with a more severe response). Finally, individuals in the IS-compartment will either move on to recovery or death due to the infection. This splitting of the traditional infectious compartment is motivated by mounting evidence of asymptomatic transmission of SARS CoV-2 (17, (33) (34) (35) (36) . Thus, we consider two trajectories for the course of the disease, similar to those employed by (15) : (1) E \u2192 IA \u2192 R and (2) E \u2192 IA \u2192 IS \u2192 R (or death). More precisely, once in the E state, an individual will transition to the infectious state IA, at a per-person rate of \u03b5. A proportion p will move from IA to the recovered state R (at a rate of p \u2375). A proportion (1p) of individuals in the IA state will develop more severe systems and transition to Is (at a rate of (1p) \u2375). Individuals in the Is state recover at a per-person rate of or die at a per-person rate \u03bcS. In each state, normal mortality of the individual occurs at the per-person rate \u03bc and newly susceptible (S) individuals enter the population at a rate \u03bcN. The important differences between these two trajectories are in how likely an individual is to move down one path or another, how infectious individuals are (both for people and for the environment), how long individuals spend in each trajectory, and how likely death is along each trajectory.",

Thus, A IA / N and S IS / N (where N is the total population of people) represent the daily fraction of the environment that interacts with asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals, respectively. Lastly, the additional factor of (1 -W) gives the fraction of surfaces/objects in the environment that have the potential for becoming infected, and so A IA\u00b7(1 -W) / N (and analogously for IS) gives the fraction of the environment that becomes infected by people each day.

Fixing constrains one of the two parameters, or \u2375, and the other can be fitted; we choose to fit and therefore constrain \u2375. The second fixed parameter , the normal death rate, was calculated by taking the reciprocal of the average life expectancy (in days) of the 17 countries sampled, weighted by population size. We calculated a value of 80.3 years, based on data from individual countries (39) . The third parameter S is the sum of the normal death rate and an additional death rate due to a more severe form of the infection. We assumed a death rate of 3.8% (38) and that death follows after initial symptoms between 3 and 4 weeks (38) . Thus S = + 0.038/(3.5 * 7), where we use the average of 3 and 4 weeks and we convert to days with the factor of 7. The fourth fixed parameter , the recovery rate once in the symptomatic state, was assumed to be the reciprocal of the average of 3 and 6 weeks (the range of recovery times) (4, 38) times the fraction of individuals in the symptomatic state that do not die, i.e. 1 -0.038, so = (1 -0.038)/(4.5 * 7). The fifth fixed parameter k, the rate of viral decay in the environment, is the reciprocal of the average time that SARS-CoV-2 is expected to survive in the environment across a set of physical surfaces, based on the survival times across a handful of materials (19) . The sixth fixed parameter p, the fraction of individuals in the IA state that move on to recovery without experiencing severe symptoms, was taken to be 0.956 (2) .

And, assuming 1 initial infected individual, the time to reach 10 cases for the former rate would be about 10.0 days (~log(10)/0.231) and the time for the latter would be 19.8 days (~log(10)/0.116). Thus, since recovery of symptomatic individuals, which takes between 3 and 6 weeks (36, 38) exceeds this interval, we expect that at the point when 10 cases have accumulated, all cases are still active.

Using the fitted parameters provided in Tables 1-3, and S1-S3, we calculate AIC values for the two mechanistic models: the standard SEIR model and the SEIR-W model. Table S4 displays the summary of the AIC values for each model-type fit to the first 30 days after the first day with total counts \u226510. In 10/17 countries (including 9/11 European countries), the SEIR-W model provided a better fit to the country data. In Figure 2 , we display the comparative individual country fit results for 4 of the countries with the fastest 30-day case growth rates-Spain, Italy, Iran, and Switzerland. The SEIR-W variant provides a better fit (significantly lower AIC score) than the standard SEIR model for all of these. Note that, as features of independent country epidemics are myriad and difficult to disentangle, several aspects independent of the model structure could explain the superior fit of the SEIR-W models.

Analysis of the \u211b0 and its subcomponents highlights that many aspects of outbreak dynamics are sensitive to the parameter associated with environmental decay rate (k in the model presented in this study). Analysis of hypothetical settings purely comprising substances of a certain kind (\"surface world\") fortifies the significance of free-living survival on physical surfaces and environmental transmission in outbreak dynamics. While our findings cannot speak to the outbreak dynamics in any particular setting in the real world, they do reveal that the surface composition of a setting can significantly influence the behavior of an outbreak. For example, The SARS-CoV-2 \u211b0 in the \"plastic world\" simulation (\u211b0 = 3.18) is over 1.3 times the \u211b0 in the \"copper world\" simulation (\u211b0 = 2.4). Many other differences between these outbreaks come as a consequence of the different \u211b0 values. For example, the \"plastic world\" simulation reaches a peak number of symptomatic infectious individuals almost 1.7 times faster than the \"copper world\" simulation, and kills over 30 times more people in the first 30 days (1,814 deaths in \"plastic world\" vs. 55 deaths in the \"plastic world\").",

A significant source of fear and speculation in the pandemic involves the plausibility that SARS-CoV-2 has undergone local adaptation in certain settings, translating to different epidemiological properties. While there is no currently convincing molecular or clinical support for local adaptation in SARS-CoV-2, our findings highlight how easy it is to conflate an environmental (or ecological) difference for a genetic one: the same virus, spreading in populations of identical size and behavior, differing only in the composition of physical surfaces where the virus can be transmitted through the environment, can have \u211b0 values between 2.4 and 3.18, with early death rates 30 times apart. These disparities may underlie the difficulty in predicting outbreaks of a single type from setting to setting, a property that has recently been captured by a concept called permutation entropy (43). Even more, settings composed of certain physical surfaces (plastic-like in our model) may be associated with phenomenon resembling a \"superspreading\" event, where individual variation in contagiousness can drive unusually large numbers of infections (44). Perhaps a better understanding of how, and on what surfaces, viral populations survive may one day improve the predictability of outbreak trajectories. Public Health Implications. Our findings suggest that the effect of social distancing in ameliorating pandemics can be amplified by limiting interactions between susceptible individuals and surfaces, rather than solely interactions between individuals. Said differently, it is not enough that individuals remain separated from other individuals during a pandemic like COVID-19, but also that individuals remain protected from other infectious individuals may have interacted.
