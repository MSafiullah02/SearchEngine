            "text": "Human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is the most important regulatory cytokine capable of stimulating the production of neutrophils from committed hematopoietic progenitor cells both in vitro and in vivo [1]. G-CSF not only increases neutrophil counts, but also enhances and primes many neutrophil functions. It is widely used in cancer patients to hasten recovery from chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and to mobilise peripheral blood progenitor cells for bone marrow transplantation [2, 3, 4, 5]. G-CSF has proved safe and effective when used for longer periods in patients with drug-induced neutropenia, particularly following solid organ transplantation [6]. The prevention or curtailing of cytotoxic drug-induced neutropenia is ascribable to quantitative stimulation of granulopoiesis by G-CSF. In patients with lymphoma and even leukaemia or solid tumours, G-CSF not only shortens the duration of neutropenia, thus providing higher complete remission rates and longer disease-free survival, but also reduces the incidence of infectious episodes ( about half reduction of febrile neutropenia) [7, 8]. Interestingly, cost-effectiveness analyses have suggested that the prophylactic therapy of patients with chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia with recombinant colony-stimulating factors may be justified if the expected risk of neutropenic fever is greater than 40%.",

            "text": "Because G-CSF increases both the number and the functions of neutrophils, it is an attractive candidate for biological immunotherapy in non-neutropenic patients with serious infections [9]. In this situation, benefits can be expected to arise from the qualitative effects of G-CSF, which enhance host defences by increasing neutrophil survival, proliferation, maturation, differentiation, adhesion, chemotaxis, respiratory burst, antibody-dependent cellular toxicity and intracellular microbial killing [10]. All these effects have been demonstrated mainly on blood neutrophils from healthy volunteers. G-CSF effects are mediated via specific receptors whose number on the neutrophil membrane is subjected to regulation by microbial products and cytokines [11, 12]. Furthermore, intracellular events induced by G-CSF [13] are modulated by the effects of other mediators. Consequently, G-CSF effects are probably influenced by the local environment (e.g., the pro-inflammatory/anti-inflammatory cytokine balance). Monocytes/macrophages also carry G-CSF receptors [14] and their functions, including cytokine synthesis, are sensitive to G-CSF. Few studies have investigated G-CSF effects on isolated monocytes/macrophages. A pro-inflammatory effect or an anti-inflammatory effect of G-CSF on monocytes has been suggested based on the influence of G-CSF on the cytokine balance [13]. These discrepancies may stem from differences across study populations (e.g., healthy individuals versus critically ill patients).",

Most patients with infection have high plasma levels of endogenous G-CSF, and those who do not seem to have a worse prognosis [15]. The main reason for using G-CSF in non-neutropenic critically ill patients is the acquired impairment of cellular immunity that affects both neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages in these patients [16, 17]. This immunoparalysis may delay the eradication of infection, despite appropriate antibiotic treatment, or increase the risk of subsequent nosocomial infection. Impairments in blood neutrophil functions were described many years ago in critically ill patients with severe infection [18]. They include reduced production of reactive oxygen species, reduced intracellular bacterial killing and impaired migration to infected sites [17, 19]. As expected, these impairments in neutrophil functions increase the risk of nosocomial infection [17]. Monocyte functions are also impaired: deactivation (impaired response to subsequent endotoxin challenge) has been demonstrated, as well as reduced HLA-DR expression responsible for the impaired recognition of foreign antigens [16, 20]. Macrophage functions have been less extensively studied, at least in humans. Experiments carried out using animal models of peritonitis have shown reduced CMH expression, impaired secretion of TNF-\u03b1 and nitric oxide, and reduced bactericidal properties [21].",

Investigations of several animal models of severe bacterial infection without neutropenia found that G-CSF, either alone or in combination with antibiotics, significantly enhanced host defences or improved survival rates [31]. This result was somewhat surprising, since it had been reported that bacterial antigens down-regulated the G-CSF receptors at the surface of granulocytes [12]. During canine bacterial pneumonia, G-CSF decreased plasma endotoxin and serum TNF-\u03b1 levels, attenuated sepsis-associated myocardial dysfunction and prolonged survival [32]. Similar results have been obtained in a rabbit model of Pasteurella multocida pneumonia [33], in a granulocytopenic mouse model of Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infection [34], in a model of Klebsiella pneumonia [35] and in models of pneumococcal pneumonia [36, 37]. G-CSF also has therapeutic effects in experimental Candida pneumonia [38].",

Preclinical experience with prophylactic G-CSF showed that the stimulatory effects on immune responses were potentially harmful, with worse lung injury and outcomes in some types of bacterial pneumonia [54, 55, 56, 57, 58]. G-CSF has been reported to exacerbate the pulmonary toxicity of cancer chemotherapy or acute lung injury related to an infectious process, during or after neutropenia recovery [58, 59, 60]. These facts raise concern regarding the use of G-CSF in mechanically ventilated ICU patients. However, in non-neutropenic patients given G-CSF, either at infection onset to prevent multiple organ dysfunction or later in the ICU stay to prevent nosocomial infection, no serious adverse pulmonary effects have been reported [22, 23, 24, 25, 28, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 49, 50] (Table 1). It should be borne in mind that the total number of non-neutropenic critically ill patients who have been treated with G-CSF is very small, as compared to the number of neutropenic patients. However, exacerbation of acute lung injury, which was the main concern based on theoretical grounds, has not been demonstrated and a thought-provoking finding is that G-CSF is the only therapeutic agent that has been associated with prevention of ARDS in human trials [28].",

These effects result directly from improved infection control and indirectly from attenuation of the overwhelming, damaging, pro-inflammatory response.",

The explanation probably lies in the wide variability of the biological response in ICU patients, which modulates G-CSF effects. Further studies in patients at high risk of hospital-acquired infection should assess whether a biological marker of G-CSF efficiency could be identified (i.e., endogenous G-CSF levels). Also, treatment schedules and dosages that are likely to be effective should be determined.",
