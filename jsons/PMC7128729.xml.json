However, since the 1950s, physicians have been faced with emerging and reemerging infectious diseases (EIDs), which have brought significant public health and financial challenges. As an example, in 2010, specialists struggled with a mysterious clinical picture that associated a severe inflammatory syndrome with vascular events such as venous thromboembolisms or transient ischemic attacks. At least ten cases were described, especially in patients with either autoimmune diseases or haematologic malignancies [2]. Despite multiple investigations, no microbiologic agent was identified, and no clinical improvement was observed on various antibiotic regimens until a eubacterial 16S RNA PCR followed by genome sequencing revealed the presence of Neoehrlichia mikurensis. This strict intracellular bacterium is related to Ehrlichia spp., the agent of human ehrlichiosis, and is emerging as a tick-borne zoonotic pathogen. Patients were subsequently switched to doxycycline therapy and rapidly improved.",

We decided to include only new genera and species belonging to a previously characterized genus only when it caused a clinical entity distinct from the other species in the genus (i.e. Chlamydia pneumoniae). The list is thus far from being complete, and it does not include all newly discovered pathogenic species. For example, before 1984, only eight species of the genus Rickettsia were known to be pathogenic in humans, two of the typhus group and six of the spotted fever group. Currently, at least 25 species of the spotted fever group are recognized, most of which are pathogenic to humans or strongly suspected to be [7], [8], [9], [10]. In addition, new virulent strains of known species have been discovered such as the enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (O104:H4), which caused a large outbreak of hemolytic uremic syndrome in 2011 in Germany and was associated with sprout consumption [11], [12].",

            "text": "Adjunction of specific antibiotics or selective substrates to broad-spectrum media, as well as optimization of culture duration and temperature, or preinoculation filtration and plate centrifugation, have significantly improved the efficiency of traditional culture [13]. Thus, prolongation of the incubation up to 12 weeks (instead of 6 weeks) allowed the recovery from patients' blood of various Mycobacterium, especially M. genavensae, that would otherwise remain undetected [14]. Additional examples of such improvements are the isolation of the enterohemorrhagic E. coli using a sorbitol\u2013MacConkey media [15] and the culture of Campylobacter spp. or Helicobacter spp. using a selective antibiotic-containing media [16], [17]. Similarly, specific media have also been developed, such as Kelly media allowing the culture of Borrelia spp. [18]. Finally, cell culture played a significant role in the identification of emerging bacteria, as many of the recently discovered species are strict intracellular bacteria. Historically, these bacteria were recovered using animal models or embryonated eggs. Various cell culture models can be used, including mammalian cells, such as HEL cell lines, which enabled the recovery of Tropheryma whipplei from a cardiac valve biopsy sample [19], and monocyte cell lines, which were used to isolate Ehrlichia spp. [20]. Nevertheless, because bacteria often present host restriction, nonmammalian cell models such as amoebae have been used. Amoebae are extremely useful to discover new microorganisms, either through amoebae co-culture or amoebal enrichment, especially in highly contaminated samples such as water or sputum [21]. Indeed, most amoebae feed on other bacteria, and amoebal co-culture are therefore less subject to contamination. This technique has enabled us to isolate various Chlamydia-related bacteria, such as Parachlamydia acanthamoebae\n[22], Estrella lausannensis\n[23], [24] and Criblamydia sequanensis\n[25]. Culture with arthropod cell lines is a promising model to help identify arthropod-transmitted zoonotic agents. In addition to allowing the recovery and identification of otherwise uncultivable bacteria, cell culture provides a higher sensitivity than traditional culture. For example, the isolation of Bartonella quintana from a skin biopsy sample was only possible by culture with endothelial cell lines [26].",

Such primers amplify most bacteria present in a clinical or environmental sample, and subsequent sequencing of the amplicons allows species determination. In addition, development of next-generation sequencing, based on pyrosequencing (Illumina; 454) or proton sequencing (Ion Torrent) [33] has largely facilitated broad sequencing of PCR products, offering a complete view of the microbiome present. PCR-based and direct metagenomics studies are now widely used to study flora modifications associated with diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and ecosystem modifications. As an example, a recent study analysed the gut flora of preterm babies with necrotizing enterocolitis and found a strong association with the presence of Clostridium butyricum\n[34].",

An excellent example is provided by the reemergence of cholera (Vibrio cholerae O1) in South America in 1991, which is thought to be linked to the bilge water dumped by an Asian merchant ship off the Peruvian coast, with subsequent infection of over 1.4 million people over 6 years [43].

In addition, warming also increases algae blooms, with which epidemics of cholera seem associated [53].

Over the last 30 years, there has been an increase in the number of patients with impaired immune systems. Recent medical advances partly contribute to this phenomenon by enabling higher survival rates of patients with cancer, with chronic diseases such as renal insufficiency and diabetes, or transplant therapies. Additional contributing factors include population ageing and, on the opposite end of the spectrum, a higher rate of preterm babies as well as, the HIV epidemic and common use of immunosuppressive therapy in the management of autoimmune diseases. Cases of invasive infections, such as sepsis or endocarditis, caused by non-diphtheria Corynebacterium spp. are additional illustrations [56], [57]. These bacteria are normal residents of the skin and mucosa and are therefore often thought of as being a contaminant when found in cultures, thus delaying diagnosis. This can further affect medical management, as many of these microorganisms, such as Corynebacterium amycolatum, are multidrug resistant [57], [58]. Additionally, such patients may be at risk of severe infections due to environmental bacteria, such as Capnocytophaga canimorsus, that has now emerged as a cause of septicaemia in splenectomized or cirrhotic patients bitten by dogs [59].",

            "text": "As mentioned, molecular studies have helped in identifying the causative agents of emerging diseases, especially for organisms with fastidious growth requirements, and one can ask whether culture is still required. However, PCR identifies both living and dead bacteria, as well as bacterial fragments. Moreover, as a result of its high sensitivity, it is subject to sample contamination during the processes of sampling, extraction or amplification. This aspect has already been questioned in studies evaluating the association between Chlamydia pneumoniae and atherosclerosis [66]. To overcome these limitations, Fredricks and Relman [63] have established some principles to guide the use of molecular studies (Table 2). However, the sole isolation of bacterial nucleic acids from a patient does not prove causation of the disease, and additional criteria are required. Indeed, though identification of E. chaffeensis was done by PCR, evidence of its pathogenic role was provided by the visualization of typical morulae within leucocytes as well as serologic evidence [67]. Similarly, excellent antibiotic response strongly supports the role of N. mikurensis in the cases described earlier. With that in mind, and with the criteria already proposed (Table 2), we recommend that the elements listed in Table 3\nbe taken into account to determine the pathogenic role of a recently isolated bacterium. However, as a result of the more complex nature of recent infectious diseases, it is hopeless to think that every criterion can be strictly met. We should not expect absolute comparisons such as \u2018absent\u2019 or \u2018present\u2019 but instead refer to relative differences that make epidemiologic sense. For example, the correlation between serology and direct identification of C. pneumoniae through PCR is not good [68] and might be explained by a delay (2\u20133 weeks) in the appearance of immunoglobulin (Ig) M [69]; the association between pneumonia and C. pneumoniae is nevertheless commonly accepted. Similarly, the very high proportion of the population exhibiting a positive serology to C. pneumoniae makes it impossible to use IgG for epidemiologic studies investigating possible long-term complications that may be associated with this new pathogen, such as asthma exacerbation or bronchial hyperactivity, as suspected by recent observations [70], [71], [72]. Finally, certain bacteria present some host restriction, and the development of an experimental animal model may not always be possible.",

However, efforts can be made to rapidly identify the epicenters of potential epidemics using new technologies such as social networks and media in order to prevent the uncontrolled spread of emerging diseases. The example provided by the Haitian cholera outbreak mapping, in 2010, based on social and media reports, is promising [73]. In addition, resources should be allocated to perform clinical studies of quality to precisely define the clinical relevance of recently discovered bacteria, to develop accurate diagnostic tools and to assess the benefits of antibiotic treatments to prevent inadequate antibiotic use. International collaborations are of the utmost importance because globalization has increased infectious disease dissemination; further, such collaborations will help researchers avoid low-powered studies that lead to inconclusive results. It should be emphasized that microbes are not only associated with infectious diseases but, as outlined above, also with noninfectious diseases such as asthma or cancer; therefore, research on emerging pathogens should not only focus on emerging infections but also more broadly on new pathologies that may be associated with these newly discovered bacterial agents. Finally, efforts should be made to increase the general population's knowledge of emerging diseases and to provide a scientifically validated message of the actual risks to ensure that people adequately seek medical care after exposure and comply with general preventive measures.",
