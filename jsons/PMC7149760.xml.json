However, as the twentieth century came to a close, the perceived difficulties in production, weaponization, and deployment of these biological weapons as well as a belief that moral restraints would preclude the use of these weapons gave many a false sense of security. Recently, a number of events have served to focus attention on the threat of terrorism and the potential for the use of biological, chemical, or nuclear weapons against the military, civilian populations, or agriculture for the purpose of causing illness, death, or economic loss. This possibility became a reality in October 2001 when someone sent spores of Bacillus anthracis to media companies in New York City and Boca Raton, Florida, resulting in five deaths, considerable panic throughout the United States and other countries, and raised the awareness of our vulnerability.",

Furthermore, terrorists can be distinguished from other types of criminals by their motivation and objective; however, criminals may also be driven by psychological pathologies and may use biological agents.

            "text": "The use of viral agents for biological warfare has a long history, which predates their recognition and isolation by culture. Their early use is consistent with what, at the time, was known about infectious diseases, particularly smallpox. In the sixteenth century, the Spanish explorer, Francisco Pizarro, presented the indigenous peoples of South America with variola-contaminated clothing, which resulted in widespread epidemics of smallpox. During the French and Indian War (1745\u201367), Sir Jeffrey Amherst, commander of the British forces in North America, suggested the deliberate use of smallpox to \u2018reduce\u2019 Native American tribes hostile to the British. Captain Ecuyer (one of Amherst's subordinates), fearing an attack on Ft. Pitt from Native Americans, acquired two variola-contaminated blankets and a handkerchief from a smallpox hospital and, in a gesture of good will, distributed them to the Native Americans. As a result, several outbreaks of smallpox occurred in various tribes in the Ohio River valley. In 1775, during the Revolutionary War, the British attempted to spread smallpox among the Continental forces by inoculating (variolation) civilians fleeing Boston. In the South, there is evidence that the British were going to distribute slaves who had escaped during hostilities, and were sick with smallpox, back to the rebel plantations in order to spread the disease.",

Allegations have been made by the government of Cuba that the CIA was responsible for the massive outbreaks of swine fever in 1971 and dengue fever in 1980 that ravaged the country. However, subsequent investigations have failed to find substantive proof of CIA involvement in these outbreaks. The Aum Shinrikyo, a religious cult responsible for the 1995 release of sarin gas in the Tokyo subway system, was also involved in biological warfare activity and sent a team of 40 people to Zaire to acquire Ebola virus. Fortunately, they were unsuccessful in this endeavor. In 1997, unknown farmers in New Zealand deliberately and illegally introduced rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (a calicivirus) onto the south island as an animal control tool to kill feral rabbits.",

            "text": "Over the past two decades, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been involved in a number of biocrimes. This most likely reflects the availability of HIV-contaminated blood as a source of this virus. For example, in 1990, Graham Farlow, an asymptomatic HIV-positive inmate at a prison in New South Wales, Australia, injected a guard with HIV-contaminated blood. The guard became infected with HIV; Farlow subsequently died of AIDS. In 1992, Brian T. Stewart, a phlebotomist at a St. Louis, MO hospital, injected his 11-month-old son with HIV-contaminated blood during a fight over payment of child support. In 1993, Iwan E. injected his former girlfriend with 2.5 ml of HIV-contaminated blood after she broke up with him. In 1994, Dr. Richard J. Schmidt, a married Louisiana gastroenterologist, injected a former lover with HIV-contaminated blood. Molecular typing of the HIV strains demonstrated that she contracted the same strain of HIV as found in one of Dr. Schmidt's patients. In perhaps the most famous case, Dr. David Acer, a Florida dentist infected with HIV, transmitted the disease to six of his patients between 1987 and 1990. The intentional infection of these patients is a possibility although there is no direct evidence. In spite of these incidents, HIV has not been included on lists of threat agents for public health bioterrorism preparedness. However, some contend that HIV has great weapon potential if the goal is to destabilize a society.",

In 1999, an article appeared suggesting that the CIA was investigating whether Iraq was responsible for causing the outbreak of West Nile fever in the New York City area. The story relied heavily on a previous story written by an Iraqi defector, claiming that Saddam Hussein planned to use West Nile virus strain SV 1417 to mount an attack. The investigation indicated that there was no known evidence of bioterrorism involved in the spread of West Nile virus. A fictional \u2018virus\u2019 was also involved in one of the largest bioterrorism hoaxes in 2000. According to e-mail messages widely circulated on the Internet, an organization known as the Klingerman Foundation was mailing blue envelopes containing sponges contaminated with a fictional pathogen called the \u2018Klingerman virus\u2019.

A report for the United Nations on chemical and biological weapons and the effects of their possible use gave estimates on the numbers of casualties produced by a hypothetical biological attack (Table 1\n). Three viruses (Rift Valley fever virus, Tick-borne encephalitis virus, and Venezuelan Equine Encephalomyelitis (VEE) virus) were evaluated in a scenario in which 50 kg of the agent was released by aircraft along a 2 km line upwind of a population center of 500 000. The viral agents produced fewer casualties and impacted a smaller area when compared with the bacterial agents used in this hypothetical model. Of note, smallpox was apparently not evaluated because it had not yet been eradicated and level of vaccine-induced immunity in the population was high.",

The Soviet Union reportedly conducted a live field test of Variola major virus on Vozrozhdeniye Island in the Aral Sea in the 1970s, in which 400 g of the virus was released into the atmosphere by explosion. Unfortunately, a laboratory technician who was collecting plankton samples from an oceanographic research vessel 15 km from the island became infected. It was reported that after returning home to Aralsk, she transmitted the infection to several people including children. All those infected died. A number of other viruses that infect humans (e.g., Ebola virus, Lassa fever virus, enterovirus 70) or livestock (e.g., foot and mouth disease virus, rinderpest, Newcastle disease virus) have also been studied for their offensive capabilities or for the development of medical and veterinary countermeasures.",

The filoviruses, Ebola and Marburg, can also be highly infectious by the airborne route. Humans are generally susceptible to infection with these viruses with fatality rates greater than 80%, and infection can be transmitted between humans through direct contact with virus-containing body fluids. There are five species of arenaviruses (Lassa fever, Junin, Machupo, Guanarito, and Sabia) that can cause viral hemorrhagic fevers with a case fatality rate of about 20%. Large quantities of these viruses can be produced by propagation in cell culture. Infection occurs via the respiratory pathway suggesting that dissemination via aerosol might be used by a terrorist. Human to human transmission has also been reported with aerosol transmission the most likely route for at least some of the secondary cases. The filoviruses and arenaviruses discussed above are BSL-4 agents and diagnostic capacities for infections caused by these viruses are limited.",

Instead, the ectromelia virus vector expressing IL-4 altered the host's immune response to this virus resulting in lethal infections in normally genetically resistant mice (e.g., C57BL/6). Additionally, this virus also caused lethal infections in mice previously immunized against infection with ectromelia virus.

Recently, the complete coding sequences of all eight viral RNA segments has been determined by using reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) to amplify the viral RNA sequences from formalin-fixed and frozen tissue samples from individuals who died during this pandemic in an effort to shed light on both the reasons for its extraordinary virulence and evolutionary origin. More recently, researchers reconstructed the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic virus using reverse genetics and observed that this reconstructed virus exhibited exceptional virulence in the model systems examined and that the 1918 hemaglutinin and polymerase genes were essential for optimal virulence.",

Viral agents are much more prone to genetic variation and mutation, and can be manipulated or created in the laboratory to take on desired characteristics. Differentiating between natural and intentional viral disease outbreaks can be challenging. Unlike bacterial diseases, many of which are treatable, there are fewer medical countermeasures to employ when dealing with viral infections.
