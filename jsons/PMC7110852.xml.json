The speed, accessibility and efficiency of air travel sets it well apart from land and sea travel with respect to the volume and speed at which people travel around the world [2]. Low airfares and a series of socioeconomic factors have made global air travel popular, with unprecedented volumes of passengers moving quickly from one side of the world to the other, in as little as 14 h [3]. The number of passengers has increased year on year from approximately 642 million in 1980 to just over four billion in January 2019 [4].",

In recent years, there have been many documented outbreaks of infectious diseases associated with the movement of humans via air or other forms of travel [5]. Regions including the Indo-Pacific, Africa and Latin America are highly popular travel destinations and bear particular challenges with respect to hyperendemic infectious diseases [6]. Recent outbreaks of Measles [7], Ebola [8], sexually transmitted infections (STIs) [9], influenza [10] and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [11] have been associated with human air travel. The large scale and rapid spread of many of these outbreaks is facilitated by high volumes of intercontinental air travel. Fuelling the outbreaks are transnational flight times that are shorter than the incubation periods for several infectious diseases, meaning that asymptomatic or prodromal infected travellers pass health screening measures and reach their destination undetected [12].",

Global travel to and from countries with poor sanitation and high rates of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) are particularly problematic [14]. Over 300 million travellers visit these high risk areas each year worldwide and more than 20% return as new carriers of resistant organisms [15]. The Western Pacific, Southeast Asia and Eastern Mediterranean regions have the highest burden of resistance, with more than 60% of AMR carriage occurring via Thailand and India [16]. These popular destinations, as well as the Middle East, have high rates of extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) resistance, one of the most commonly acquired resistance mechanisms worldwide [17]. The rapid emergence of drug-resistant Candida auris has gained international attention with outbreaks in healthcare facilities around the world, including in patients within Victoria and New South Wales in Australia who acquired the infection from overseas hospitals [18]. The human, societal, commercial and economic impacts of AMR and outbreaks of infectious disease is high, including airlines which suffer economic and reputational losses in the order of tens of millions of dollars [19].",

There is also an established body of literature and research regarding infection control and the prevention of the spread of infectious diseases via sea travel, including guidelines focusing on the containment and prevention of gastrointestinal [[25], [26], [27], [28]] and respiratory infectious diseases such as norovirus [29,30] and influenza [31,32], as well as other highly contagious infectious diseases [[33], [34], [35], [36], [37]]. There is however, by comparison, a dearth of corollary published literature and research on infection control and the prevention of infectious diseases associated with air travel [1]. While there is growing research exploring airborne spread of pathogens within aircraft [[38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44]], little of this appears to have been translated to passenger and staff health and wellbeing programs to contain and prevent the spread of infectious diseases. In 1997 Leggat argued that airline magazines were an underutilised source of traveller health advice [45]. Some studies have examined passenger's health information within commercial travel websites [46], travel agencies [47], and airline inflight magazines [48], which overall conclude an ongoing lack of the provision of health advice provided to passengers travelling by air particularly in respect to infectious diseases control and prevention.",

There were eight airline websites (11%) that contained information for passengers recommending immunisation for vaccine-preventable diseases, particularly Cholera and Yellow Fever. One Asian airline, namely Air China, directed individuals to seek information on vaccines against influenza, malaria, hepatitis B virus and epidemic encephalitis B. Two airline websites, South African Airways and HK Express, provided information about Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) for passengers who may have visited endemic areas, and included website links to official government advisory websites. Five airline websites (two from Japan, one from Great Britain, one from Middle East and one from South Africa) featured a list of common and highly contagious infections (including Influenza, Measles, Chicken Pox and Tuberculosis) and their respective transmission periods. The website for Thai Airways provided comprehensive advice on handwashing, advocating it as an effective way for passengers to prevent infectious diseases. The website for Jeju Air, a Korean airline, was the only one to feature information about Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV). This was presented in the form of a safety guide that featured advice on hand washing, mask use, cough etiquette, and contact details for a 24-h MERS-CoV hotline.

More than three billion passengers travel by air annually, with the majority of journeys occurring in less than 24 h [49]. This brings significant challenges for measures to minimise the spread of infectious diseases and to prevent and control infectious diseases outbreaks. Passengers are vectors for the spread of infectious issues, with well-documented cases of inflight and post-flight transmission of influenza [50], measles [51], meningococcal infections [52] and multi-drug resistant tuberculosis [53] among several other infectious agents [44,54]. Air travel has been a facilitator of the emergence or re-emergence of once eradicated infectious agents. A single case of imported measles by air travel in 2005, resulted in the re-emergence of this disease in the state of Indiana and USA [55]. South Korea has reported an increase in travel-related cases of dengue [56].",

Only 35 out of the 73 websites analysed featured some useful information about infection control and the prevention of infectious diseases. When there was information about infection control and the prevention of infectious diseases it was limited in nature and often reflected specific migration requirements for specific countries. The information provided was most commonly about passenger vaccination status prior to travel, passengers fitness to travel, with some suggestions to seek medical advice and clearance if the passenger thought they were unwell with an infectious disease. The airline websites did not feature systematic advice recommending passengers not to travel (or to defer their travel) if they self-suspected they had an infectious disease or were confirmed as being infected with an infectious disease by a healthcare professional.",

Thai Airways and Turkish Airlines websites did provide advice recommending the use of hand sanitiser and/or wipes for both hand hygiene and surface disinfection on board. It is well-documented that the use of disinfectant wipes to decontaminate the common-use and high touch surfaces (e.g. tray table, entertainment screen, remote control units and seatbelt buckles) within a passenger's local environment helps to break the chain of infection [[57], [58], [59]]. Only one airline website, Jeju Air from Korea, provided information about MERS-CoV. This may reflect national concerns following the outbreak of MERS-CoV in South Korea in 2015 which originated from a passenger who travelled by air from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia [60].",

            "text": "Existing research demonstrates that air travellers actively seek health advice with respect to the risk of infectious diseases and their travel destinations [61]. Leggat [45], in 1997, identified the need to do more regarding the availability of travel health advice provided by airlines using inflight magazines. Yet, more than 20 years later, the results of this study suggest that airlines have appeared to not take advantage of the opportunity to provide passengers with tailored and comprehensive advice regarding how they can protect themselves from infectious diseases. Such advice should be included among the other health and wellbeing advice provided to passengers in the pre-flight [62,63], inflight [45,64] and post-flight [65,66] periods of their journey. It may be argued that such advice can be found in official government websites, such as Australia's SmartTraveller\u2122, and that the travelling public should consult those sources of information. In this study there were very few airline websites that directed passengers to such sources of information based on the keyword search strategy used, which suggest missed opportunities to inform passengers of measures to reduce the risk of the spread of infectious disease and improve their overall travel experience. Our study found that in most cases where information regarding infection control and the prevention of infectious diseases was present it was not easy to locate. Only 50 of the 73 airline websites had a built-in search engine tool. The lack of a built-in search engine tool in the remaining 23 airline websites is a barrier to passengers wanting to search for information that a specific airline provides to its passengers about infectious diseases and how they can lower their risk. In this study we used a computational Python\u2122 script to search for the keywords of interest in websites that had no built-in search tool, which the everyday travelling public would not have access to. The availability, prominence and searchability of this kind of information may help inform and improve passengers' health-related behaviours, particularly those relating to infection control and the prevention of infectious diseases.",
