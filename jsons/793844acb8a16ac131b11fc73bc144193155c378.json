The age of the foal, history of passive transfer, parasite control and previous disease history are all important, as is information pertaining to any other clinically affected animals from the same environment and husbandry practices in the affected yard. A good history combined with a thorough physical examination is often enough to form a presumptive diagnosis, and is often all that is available at the initiation of treatment.",
