            "text": "Seasonal influenza is an acute infectious disease that may lead to severe illness and death, especially among young children, elderly people and those with chronic illnesses. The annual burden of seasonal influenza is estimated to be 3\u20135 million cases of severe illness and approximately 250,000\u2013500,000 deaths globally.1 In the United States, elderly people (aged \u226565 years) account for approximately 90% of influenza-associated deaths.2 Vaccination is recommended as the most effective way to prevent seasonal influenza by the World Health Organisation,1 the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention3 and the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention.4 These agencies urge elderly people to be vaccinated against influenza each year. Evidence suggests that the influenza vaccine has a moderate preventive effect among elderly people and that it significantly decreases the morbidity of influenza and pneumonia,5 respiratory or cardiovascular complications6 and risk of hospitalisation and death.7, 8, 9, 10 A Cochrane review11 confirmed the safety of the influenza vaccine but found no convincing evidence for its effectiveness. However, the use of inappropriate analytic techniques cast doubt on these findings. Beyer et al.12 reanalysed the same data using a biological and conceptual framework and found meaningful predictions for the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine that supported ongoing efforts to vaccinate elderly people.",

Researchers have criticised the HBM for neglecting the influence of social factors (i.e. social norms).25 Subjective norms in the TRA complemented this with individual behavioural perception under various cultural backgrounds. On the other hand, the TRA also has limitations, as it neglects the influence of emotions on behaviours, including threat and fear,26 which could be complemented with threat perception in the HBM. Therefore, the two theories have been integrated into one research framework in many studies.27, 28, 29 This review aimed to determine the factors influencing influenza vaccination behaviour among elderly people using an integrated framework derived from these two theories.",

However, further well-designed studies are required to explore inter-relationships accurately and comprehensively. Researchers or health providers could also apply the synthesis framework to practice. A good understanding of the influencing variables is needed to inform vaccination campaigns if they are to be effective.",
