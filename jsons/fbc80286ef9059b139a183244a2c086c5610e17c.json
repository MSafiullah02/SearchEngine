In this retrospective case series study, we describe the thoracic radiographic appearance of confirmed canine influenza virus in six dogs. Radiographic findings varied, but included abnormal unstructured interstitial (one) and unstructured interstitial and alveolar (five) pulmonary patterns, which were distributed cranioventral (four), diffuse (one), and caudodorsal (one). The right middle (five), left cranial (five), and right cranial (four) lung lobes were most commonly affected. Additionally, mild pleural effusion was present in one dog. Intrathoracic lymphadenopathy and cranial mediastinal widening/fluid accumulation were not detected in any dog. Canine influenza virus should be considered as a differential diagnosis for canine patients with respiratory signs and a cranioventral unstructured interstitial to alveolar pulmonary pattern.

The purpose of this report is to describe thoracic radiographic characteristics in a sample of dogs with confirmed canine influenza virus.",

Three-view (left-right lateral, right-left lateral, and ventrodorsal) thoracic radiographs obtained at the time of diagnosis were required to be included in the study. Dogs were excluded from the study if they were diagnosed with concurrent nonrespiratory thoracic disease or did not have diagnostic three-view thoracic radiographs available for review. For each dog, the signalment (age, breed, sex), history, and method of diagnosis were recorded from the medical record by board-certified veterinary radiologist (S.S.). The results of any additional respiratory diagnostics and Vet Radiol Ultrasound, Vol. 57, No. 5, 2016, pp 462-466. method of sample collection were also recorded. Thoracic radiographs were independently reviewed by two boardcertified veterinary radiologists (S.S., A.S.) using dedicated image-viewing software (Osirix, Pixmeo, Geneva, Switzerland). The results of independent reading sessions were compared and, where disagreement occurred, a consensus opinion was generated. Reviewers were aware of the patient's diagnosis and allowed to adjust contrast and brightness of the images as would be done in the clinical setting. Radiographic characteristics recorded were the following: presence of lymphadenopathy, pleural effusion, cranial mediastinal widening/fluid accumulation, and abnormal pulmonary patterns. If present, pleural effusion was graded as mild (minimal displacement the lung lobes), moderate (heart and diaphragm partially obscured), or severe (heart and diaphragm completely obscured). Abnormal pulmonary patterns were classified as unstructured interstitial, structured/nodular interstitial, bronchial, and alveolar. The distribution of the abnormal pulmonary patterns was recorded as cranioventral, perihilar, caudodorsal, or diffuse. If diffuse, the changes were further subclassified as symmetric or asymmetric. The specific lung lobes affected were also recorded.",

Four dogs had a history of recently visiting a boarding/daycare facility with two dogs having known direct contact with dogs subsequently diagnosed with canine influenza virus. In regards to additional respiratory diagnostics, three of six patients were diagnosed with concurrent Mycoplasma pneumonia based on a positive polymerase chain reaction via a transtracheal wash (1) or pharyngeal swab (2).

While none of the dogs had radiographically apparent lymphadenopathy or cranial mediastinal widening/effusion, one dog was identified with pleural effusion, which was graded as mild. This dog was also positive for Mycoplasma. One dog had an unstructured interstitial pattern, while the remaining five dogs had two pulmonary patterns present, unstructured interstitial and alveolar (Fig. 1) . No dog was identified with a structured interstitial or bronchial pattern. The distribution of the pulmonary patterns was cranioventral in four dogs, diffuse in one, and caudodorsal in one. None of the dogs had a perihilar distribution. The one dog with a diffuse pulmonary pattern was further classified as asymmetric being more severe in the right lung lobes (Fig. 2) . The dog with a caudodorsal distribution of an unstructured interstitial pattern had a cranioventral alveolar pattern on follow up thoracic radiographs 3 days later. No other dog had follow up radiographs for comparison. In all dogs, multiple lung lobes were affected. The left cranial, left caudal, right cranial, right middle, and right caudal lungs were affected in two dogs; one with a cranioventral distribution, and another with a diffuse distribution. Two dogs had abnormal pulmonary patterns in the right cranial, right middle, and left cranial lung lobes; both with a cranioventral distribution.

Secondary bacterial or mycoplasma infections have been documented in dogs with more severe canine influenza virus, 3, 4 however all dogs in this study survived to discharge consistent with the previously noted low mortality rate. 2 While a normal inhabitant of the canine upper respiratory tract, Mycoplasma spp. have been documented as a primary cause of pneumonia or as a coinfection. [5] [6] [7] [8] It is unknown if the positive polymerase chain reaction results for Mycoplasma in two of the three dogs in this study indicated true disease or normal flora based on sample location (pharyngeal). Thus possible effects of coinfection with Mycoplasma spp. on the radiographic findings in this sample of dogs remain unclear. A prior case series of 17 dogs with Mycoplasma spp. pneumonia identified a variety of radiographic changes including pleural effusion; tracheal collapse; and interstitial, bronchial, alveolar, and mixed pulmonary patterns. 5 Radiographically, lymphadenopathy, and mediastinal widening/effusion were not identified in any of the dogs. Mild pleural effusion was noted in one dog. While lymphadenopathy, mediastinal fluid/hemorrhage, and pleural effusion have been reported in dogs with pneumonia, it is unknown whether these findings are related to the underlying infectious agent, duration of infection or other patient factors. 5, 9 Pulmonary patterns identified in this study are consistent with prior studies that suggest interstitial and alveolar are the most common pulmonary patterns for both bacterial and viral pneumonia. 6, 9, 10, [12] [13] [14] It has been noted that pulmonary changes initially start as an interstitial pattern and, as the disease progresses, the pattern becomes alveolar. 10, 12 The progression of disease would explain why both interstitial and alveolar patterns were identified in all but one dog in this study. The one dog in this study with an initial unstructured interstitial pattern did however go on to develop an alveolar pattern on follow up radiographs 3 days later.",
