            "text": "Prompt detection of pathogens is a significant issue in diagnostic testing for both human and veterinary health. This is particularly relevant when slow-growing or fastidious organisms are involved and the limitations of some existing diagnostic tools are driving researchers to consider alternative methods, as demands on quantity and rapidity of testing methods are increasing [1]. Serological methods provide an indication of exposure to a pathogen and are best used for screening populations. However, they also require an adequate time post-infection/exposure for antibodies to develop and may be unable to distinguish between different strains or antigenic types of pathogen. Zoonotic pathogens make up the majority (75%) of emerging diseases and wildlife are a major source of these pathogens [2]. Early detection of pathogens in wild animals would be useful in identifying risk factors associated with disease transmission to humans or domestic animals, and this could help prevent a possible outbreak. It has also been suggested that prevention of disease, which could be aided by an effective surveillance system, is better than reacting to an outbreak, or to finding a cure [3]. Microarrays offer the advantage of testing large numbers of samples simultaneously, coupled with screening a single sample for multiple pathogens. Use of this technology would enable timely, accurate and inexpensive detection of pathogens, which could lead to more effective control of these infectious diseases, which has positive implications for public health [4]. There are a wide ranging number of potential applications for pathogen detection arrays; and have been used for the detection of novel pathogens, as in the case of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [5], simultaneous detection of Newcastle disease virus and avian influenza virus in birds [6] and detection of viruses that can cause vesicular or vesicular-like lesions in livestock [7].",

Alternatives to the glass slide microarray are the ArrayTube\u2122 (AT) and ArrayStrip\u2122 (AS) platforms from Alere Technologies GmbH (Jena, Germany). These are much less expensive, and can be used without highly specialised equipment [8]. The AT (up to 225 spots) and AS (up to 600 spots per well) platforms make the use of a small array surface of size 4 \u00d7 4 mm placed on the bottom of a plastic vial or well. Hybridisation and analysis are simple and rapid, using standard laboratory methods, and hybridisation signals are detected following an enzyme-catalysed precipitation reaction [9]. The use of plastic tube-integrated arrays and fast non-fluorescent labelling and hybridisation protocols results in a system that is cost-effective, time saving, and allows high sample throughput, in a 96 well format [1].",

A microarray was then developed to screen for the presence of these pathogens. Table 1\nshows the list of pathogens to be screened for, including the source of any reference material if available. Unfortunately, not all of the pathogens for which the array was designed to detect could be sourced. Therefore the probes for, Hepatitis E Virus, Bartonella, MRSA, Rickettsia typhi and Streptobacillus monilliformis were not evaluated. RNA from an infected Rattus norvegicus sample was supplied but several attempts at PCR proved unsuccessful and it was concluded that the RNA had degraded too much to be of use. A further literature search was conducted to identify particular genes or target regions which had been previously used for identification purposes in other diagnostic tests such as PCR. The DNA sequences were obtained from the NCBI database and aligned using ClustalX2 (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/phylogeny/clustalW2_phylogeny/help/faq.html#5) software. Oligonucleotide sequences (probes) were designed for each pathogen from regions targeted by species-specific or generic primers. Two freely available software packages were used for probe design: Unique Probe Selector (UPS) [10] and OligoWiz [11], [12]. Both types of software were used to compensate for any limitations in the other. OligoWiz, at present, can only be used to design probes for bacteria.",

The denatured sample (100 \u03bcl) was then pipetted into the AS well and allowed to hybridise for 30 min at 55 \u00b0C at 550 rpm. The sample solution was then removed and the AS was washed successively for 20 min at 60  C at 550 rpm with 150 \u03bcl wash buffer 1 (1x SSC, 0.2% SDS), wash buffer 2 (0.1x SSC, 0.2% SDS), and wash buffer 3 (0.1x SSC). This buffer was then removed and vacant binding sites on the microarray were blocked by incubation with a blocking solution (100 \u03bcl) of 2% biotin-free milk in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.1% Tween\u2122 20 for 60 min at 30 \u00b0C at 300 rpm. The blocking solution was replaced with 100 \u03bcl conjugation solution (Streptavidin Poly-Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) diluted 1:100 in the blocking solution), and the array incubated for 15 min at 30 \u00b0C at 300 rpm. Post-conjugation washes were performed using wash buffers 1\u20133 as described for the post-hybridisation washes. After removal of wash buffer 3, 100 \u03bcl of a tetramethylbenzidine (TMB)-hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) solution, in this instance TrueBlue\u2122 (Insight BioTechnology LTD, UK), was added and incubated for 10 min at 25 \u00b0C without shaking. After removing the solution, the AS was then inserted into the ArrayMate and the array image was recorded with raw data generated. The recorded image was analysed using Alere's integrated IconoClust software and analysis script. Iconoclust processes the signals and automatically normalises the signal value after an algorithm processes the average intensity of the spot and the local background noise. The output range of the signals was between 0 and 1, with 0 being negative and 1 being the maximal possible signal value. The normalised intensity of the spots was automatically calculated by subtracting the local background noise from the average intensity of the automatically recognised spot.",

During the evaluation stage, it was determined that sequence-independent amplification resulted in lower hybridisation signals on the array than sequence-dependent amplification. Some of the pathogens (e.g. Cowpox, Toxoplasma gondii and Campylobacter jejuni), when amplified by their specific primers produced good quality, detectable, hybridisation signals, but when random amplification was used, they showed no or weak hybridisation. A DNA sample of C. jejuni for example was amplified using sequence-independent PCR and the product was then hybridised onto the array. A measurable signal was seen with 26.6% of the C. jejuni probes on the array. With specific amplification there was 100% probe hybridisation at significantly higher signal strength (data not shown).",

It is also apparent that the cross-hybridising probes were only visible in the images which show samples that had been amplified using sequence independent-amplification (Fig. 1A\u2013F). The images which show hybridisation following sequence-specific amplification were much cleaner (Fig. 1G\u2013H), and had the expected hybridisation profile. The three spots indicated by the rectangular box in all images except Fig. 1G are probes that were designed to hybridise with a wide range of Salmonella species. Fig. 1H shows the amplification of S. typhimurium with a set of primers designed to amplify this region which is common to multiple Salmonella species. S. Gallinarum (Fig. 1A), S. Dublin (Fig. 1B), S. Pullorum (Fig. 1C), S. Enteritidis (Fig. 1D), S. Hadar (Fig. 1E), and S. typhimurium (Fig. 1F\u2013H) were tested on the array.

Table 4\nshows the pathogen detected in each lane from Fig. 2A. As can be seen from the figure, the majority of lanes had a strong band. The two bands in Lane 9 represent the specific S. typhimurium amplicons (663 bp) and the generic Salmonella amplicons (428 bp). This was expected, as the multi-pathogen primer mix had primers specific for S. typhimurium, and also had primers to amplify a region common to many Salmonella species. Fig. 2B shows the spots that hybridised after using the multiplex primer mix (with biotinylated primers) on a pooled nucleic acid sample from all pathogens for which reference samples were available. Although the band seen in Lane 12 for T. gondii was quite faint, careful analysis of the recorded image indicated that all of the pathogens in the sample, including T. gondii, hybridised with the expected specific probes on the array.",

            "text": "Variation within microarray experiments can still occur regardless of careful probe design. The typical sources of variation can be broadly divided into three main categories: variation within the biological sample, the performance of the technology itself, and finally, variation in the spot signal measurements. The majority of variance in microarray experiments is generally biological rather than technical [24]. Arrays are generally made in batches and variation can occur between batches. These can include different probe concentrations, which can lead to incorrect conclusions being drawn from data [25]. Variation at the array production stage can occur for a number of reasons including, for example the particular printing pin used, the humidity, and temperature during printing. These variables can lead to slight differences in the amount of probe that is deposited on the slide surface, the amount that remains on the array surface after processing, and the level of deviation from the expected spot location. All of these factors can have an impact on the amount of labelled target that can bind to the probe, and on the efficiency of subsequent spot finding and data extraction steps [19]. The level of deviation from the expected location can result in the array reader making inaccurate readings, the signals of neighbouring probes becoming merged, or the spot can become invalid and cannot be accurately detected by the analysis software. In order to reduce the variability that is inherent in all biological experiments, experimental replication is essential. One obvious form of technical replication is through array probe replication. It is advantageous to at least have duplicates, or preferably multiples, of all probes spotted on the same array, however this may not be possible due to spotting density constraints. The precision of particular probe measurements will be more reliable if the spot intensities of the replicate spots are averaged for each sample [26].",

            "text": "To achieve an efficient hybridisation step, it is important to have probes with a narrow melting temperature distribution, because the hybridisation step takes place at the same temperature for all probes on the array [27]. The algorithms used in both OligoWiz and UPS are able to make minor adjustments to the length of each probe so that a narrow melting temperature range is achieved. Determination of melting temperature thresholds is a difficult task as this determines the conditions under which probes will bind to the target sequence. Melting temperatures can cause loss of signal if too high, and non-specific signal if too low [28]. As a single temperature is used during the hybridisation step, it is advisable that the narrowest melting temperature range be used to maximise signal detection [29].",

            "text": "The chip presented here represents a prototype microarray identification system for zoonotic pathogens that can infect rodents. The probes used on the microarray were based on genes that are unique to the pathogens selected. These genes were selected following a literature search to identify gene sequences which have been previously used to identify these pathogens, and a BLAST analysis to see if the sequences selected had similarity to any other pathogen sequences on the database. This is also the first report of biotinylated primers used in a multiplex format with up to 24 primer pairs. There was no apparent difference in the hybridisation signal produced when only a single pathogen was present in single and multiplex PCR reactions. More work needs to be done to determine the limits of detection and the sensitivity of the array, but as a proof of concept the array has demonstrated potential. Further improvements to this array could be made by obtaining reference material for pathogens which were unavailable and evaluating the probes for these pathogens. Whilst reference material was available for SEOV during the evaluation stage, several attempts at PCR proved unsuccessful. However, a number of rodent samples (nucleic acid was extracted from liver, kidney and lung of R. rattus and R. norvegicus, an aliquot of which was then pooled and amplified by multiplex PCR followed by hybridisation with the microarray) were screened on the array and two of these were identified as SEOV positive. This was later verified by both PCR and sequencing.",

This can be achieved by designing probes at a genus level with additional probes designed for differentiating between species [30].",

This occurs because in most situations the host DNA is present in much higher amounts than the pathogen nucleic acid, which makes the pathogen more difficult to detect. The sensitivity of an array may be improved by the removal of host nucleic acid by DNAses, i.e. enriching pathogen-derived nucleic acid, using dedicated methods and kits for this purpose prior to PCR amplification [31]. The sensitivity on this array was less than that of real-time PCR, as has been previously demonstrated with other pathogen detecting microarrays [14], [32], this leads to a trade-off between sensitivity and cost-effectiveness. It would have been useful to have tested the array sensitivity for RNA pathogens as well. However, as mentioned earlier, there were no working RNA pathogens available during the evaluation stage. A critical step in the development of a microarray is sourcing reference samples with which the array can be evaluated.",

However, it is now becoming increasingly clear that when a careful design is followed, the results obtained with different platforms are likely to be comparable [19], [33], [34]. The user can decide whether to invest time and resources in developing their own arrays, utilise one of the commercial providers who can assist with array design and fabrication, or use off-the-shelf commercial arrays. The relatively low cost of screening for many pathogens simultaneously in a single sample is an economical and efficient approach for rapid and sensitive diagnostics.
