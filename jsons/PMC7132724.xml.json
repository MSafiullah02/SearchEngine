            "text": "The innate immune receptors, such as Toll-like receptors, C-type lectins receptors, and Nod-like receptors, probably play a crucial role in effective immune responses to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M tuberculosis) [1]. When the bacillus encounters the host, the specific pattern-recognition receptors on human macrophage and dendritic cell (DC) recognize the M tuberculosis and trigger phagocytic cell and then induce specific signaling pathways that lead to the induction of immune responses against the pathogens. Dendritic cell\u2013specific intracellular adhesion molecule\u20133\u2013grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN), encoded by CD209, is a C-type lectin that is primarily expressed on DC and alveolar macrophage [2], [3]. As a major recognition receptor on human DCs, DC-SIGN may influence the pathogenesis of tuberculosis. M tuberculosis interacts with DC-SIGN to activate an intracellular signaling pathway with a central role for the serine/threonine kinase Raf-1. The Raf-1-acetylation\u2013dependent signaling pathway, which induces specific gene transcription profiles, is involved in the regulation of adaptive immune response to tuberculosis [4], [5], [6].",

DC-SIGN might be a crucial part in host immunity to tuberculosis and one of the candidate genes for susceptibility to tuberculosis. In addition, it has been reported that the variants of DC-SIGN have been linked to susceptibility to several other infectious diseases, such as HIV-1 [7], Dengue [8], and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [9]. The research on DC-SIGN genetic variability and its association with tuberculosis mainly focused on two regions: promoter and neck. Particularly, the \u2212336A/G loci in promoter in African populations have been studied by several groups. Barrerio et al. first reported that -336A and -871G conferred protection against tuberculosis in South African cohort [10]. Vannberg et al. further observed that -336G allele had protective effect against tuberculosis in populations from four different sub-Saharan African countries [11]. In contrast, Olesen et al., in the north African city of Tunis and Ben-Alim in the west African city of Guinea-Bissau found no association of -336 SNP polymorphism with tuberculosis [12], [13]. In non-African individuals from northwestern Colombia, G\u00f3mez et al. reported that -336 SNP did not play a protective role against tuberculosis [14]. Some of these variants may affect the function of DC-SIGN. The variant \u2212336A/G in the DC-SIGN gene promoter region was found to regulate promoter activity by affecting a Sp1-like binding site [8].",

DC-SIGN is involved not only in various DC functions, such as differentiation, migration, antigen capture and T-cell priming, but also in induction of intracellular signaling pathways via several motifs [15], [16] that can cause extensive modulation of immune responses [6]. In addition, DC-SIGN recognizes several pathogens, such as viruses (HIV-1, dengue, West Nile virus, and measles virus) [17], [18], [19], [20], bacteria (Helicobacter pylori, Streptococcus pneumoniae) [15], [21], fungi (Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus) [22] and parasites (Leishmania and Schistosoma mansoni) [23] contributing to generation of pathogen-tailored immune responses [24], induces immunosuppressive response by disarming the MAPK pathway in DCs [25], and enhances TH1 differentiation.",

The two variants and haplotype of \u2212871A/G and \u2212336A/G in the DC-SIGN gene were not associated with the susceptibility to pulmonary tuberculosis in Chinese population, although the frequency of A allele in patients for both SNPs increased somewhat. The association between DC-SIGN polymorphisms and susceptibility to tuberculosis has been described in many studies, which showed positive association in South African and sub-Saharan African populations [10], [11], whereas no association was observed in the Tunisian and Colombian populations studied [12], [14]. The host genetic background might be an explanation for this discrepancy [26], [27]. Our results showed that the allelic distribution of DC-SIGN gene in Asian populations differed from that of African and Caucasian populations and the difference between African and Asian groups was more prominent. The highest -336G allelic frequency was found in African populations and lowest was observed in Asians. Of our 481 samples, the genotype -336 GG was detected only in 1 sample. In the control group, the frequency of the -336G allele was 7.3%, whereas a high frequency (35\u201345%) was observed in African populations. Similarly, the allele -871G was absent in sub-Saharan African populations, whereas it had a frequency of 23.4% in our study [8], [10], [28], [29]. Although the two SNPs might be associated with resistance to TB in Africans, we failed to duplicate this association in the Chinese population. We speculated that for the two SNPs to take effect, other genes or combination of genes need to be involved.",

Fever is a typical symptom of active tuberculosis. The potential role of DC-SIGN on fever tuberculosis disease is novel and warrants further investigation. M tuberculosis infection induces fever, and this symptom is attributed to an increased production of predominant endogenous pyrogen, such as interleukin (IL)\u20136, IL-1, and interferon (INF)\u2013\u03b3. Moreover, M tuberculosis Manose-dependent binding to CD209 leads to Raf-1\u2013dependent upregulation of IL-6 [15]. However, the DC-SIGN -336G variant affects a Sp1 binding site and decreases the expression of DC-SIGN resulting in less efficient cytokine and chemokine secretion [8], [30]. It is hypothesized that individuals homozygous for the -336G allele may, in part, be protected from expressing low levels of DC-SIGN and therefore less prone to the IL-6 secretion induced by Manose-dependent binding to DC-SIGN.",
