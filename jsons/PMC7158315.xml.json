The gerbil is usually non-aggressive and is one of the easiest rodents to maintain and handle. Its disposition, curious nature, relative freedom from naturally occurring infectious diseases, and adaptability to its environment have contributed to its popularity as a laboratory animal (Wagner and Farrar, 1987). It has several interesting anatomical and physiological characteristics that make it a useful model in biomedical research. Several other species of gerbils (e.g. Meriones libycus, Meriones crassus) have been used as experimental animals (Belhocine et al., 2010, Khokhlova et al., 2009). However, the Mongolian gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus), on which this chapter will focus, is the most common species of gerbil used in biomedical research (Schwentker, 1963).",

            "text": "It should be noted that mammalian taxonomy is a rapidly changing field. The following description outlines a classification of the Mongolian gerbil based on morphology as well as more recent molecular techniques. Gerbils are in the class Mammalia and order Rodentia. Rodents are divided into five major suborders (Musser and Carleton, 2005). Gerbils are part of the suborder Myomorpha, originally so named because the deep and lateral masseter muscles attach to the front of the muzzle, giving it a forward thrust. Myomorphs also lack premolar teeth (Hurst, 1999). Gerbils belong to the superfamily Muroidea, family Muridae, and subfamily Gerbillinae based on morphology and on evaluation of nuclear protein coding sequences of the Lecithin Cholesterol Acyl Transferase gene and the von Willebrand factor gene (Michaux et al., 2001, Robinson, 1975b). The genus Meriones was first described by Illiger in 1811, and Meriones unguiculatus was first identified in 1867 by Milne-Edwards (Robinson, 1975; Thiessen and Yahr, 1977). Chaworth-Musters and Ellerman (1947) provided a comprehensive description of the genus Meriones which was updated by Ellerman and Morrison-Scott (1951), Corbet (1978), and Pavlinov et al. (1990).",

They are native to northern Africa, India, Mongolia, southwestern and central Asia, northeastern China, and regions of Eastern Europe (Robinson, 1976). Because wild gerbils live in arid habitats they dig burrows that extend between 50 cm and 1.5 m below the surface so the temperature is relatively constant throughout the day and night. The burrows may be small and simple with one entrance or complex with eight to 14 entrances (Agren, 1986, Brain, 1999).",

They were found by a French missionary, Father Armand David, who traveled extensively in Mongolia and China in the 1860s. Some wild-caught stock were sent to Japan, where they were bred freely (Alderton, 1986). The Mongolian gerbils that are available today originated from 20 pairs of captured animals that were maintained in 1935 by Dr. C. Kasuga in a closed, random-bred colony at the Kitasato Institute in Japan. In 1949 a sub-colony of gerbils was established at the Central Laboratories for Experimental Animals in Tokyo by M. Nomura. In 1954 Dr. V. Schwentker imported 11 pairs from Japan. Five females and four males from this group were successfully bred and formed a foundation colony which produced gerbils for distribution throughout the United States (Robinson, 1979). This foundation colony was established at Tumblebrook Farm at Brant Lake, NY, founded by Dr. Schwentker. After his retirement in 1971, the Brant Lake facilities were phased out, and the Tumblebrook Farm gerbil production colony was relocated to new facilities in West Brookfield, MA under the ownership of D.G. Robinson. The name \u201cTumblebrook Farm\u201d was retained (Robinson, 1974). A sub-colony established from seven pairs of animals by Dr. J.H. Marston at the Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology in Shrewsbury, MA during 1961\u201362 was the origin of the sub-colony established at the University of Birmingham, England in 1964. This breeding stock produced the animals used in laboratories throughout the United Kingdom and Europe. Charles River Laboratories purchased Tumblebrook Farm in 1996 giving rise to the Crl:(MON)BR strain.",

Mongolian gerbils are attracted to saliva and use salivary cues to discriminate between siblings and non-siblings, and females use oral cues in the selection of sociosexual partners (Smith and Block, 1991). The Harderian gland functions as a potential site for immune response, serves as a part of the retinal\u2013pineal axis, acts to cushion the eyeball, secretes lubrication for the eye, and is a source for pheromones and thermoregulatory lipids (Johnston et al., 1983; Sakai, 1981). Harderian gland secretions, comprised of lipids, proteins, and protoporphyrin, are carried by an excretory duct to the medial aspect of the nictitating membrane. These secretions bathe the eye and conjunctival space and are transported down the nasolacrimal duct, exiting at the external nares. The Harderian secretions are mixed with saliva and spread over the pelage during grooming (Thiessen, 1977).",

Gerbils can obtain sufficient water from their diet and their kidneys have a highly efficient urine-concentrating capacity to ensure adequate hydration (Goyal et al., 1988). The ratio of long-loop nephrons to short-loop nephrons in gerbils is high. Ninety-six percent of their nephrons are long loop which allows them to efficiently concentrate their urine (Ichii et al., 2006). The digestive system is also very efficient at absorbing and retaining water, and water can be stored in fat cell layers. Gerbils produce and excrete a small amount of concentrated urine and dry feces per day (Alderton, 1986); therefore they require less frequent cage changing than other laboratory rodents.",

The thymus is persistent in adults (Wagner and Farrar, 1987). The adrenal gland weight when compared to the body weight is approximately three times the size of the adrenal gland in rats (Cullen et al., 1971, Holmes, 1985). The significance of these anatomically enlarged structures is not known (Schwentker, 1963), although the enlarged adrenal glands are thought to contribute to their unique water conservation ability (Wagner and Farrar, 1987). The adrenal cortex produces equal amounts of corticosterone and 19-hydroxycorticosterone (Drummond et al., 1988). Unlike a rat, an adrenalectomized gerbil cannot be maintained by providing supplemental sodium (Cullen et al., 1971).",

Ruhren (1965), Mays (1969), Dillon and Glomski (1975), and Gattermann (1979) conducted studies and reported original data in gerbils. The blood volume of a Mongolian gerbil is approximately 7.7 ml/100 g. The red blood cell half life is approximately 9.9 days, which is short in comparison with that of other rodents (Womack, 1972). Young gerbils can have up to a 40% increase in circulating, stippled red blood cells and reticulocytes compared to adults (Ruhren, 1965, Smith et al., 1976). Gerbils have lower hematocrit values than mice, and have higher blood lipid values than rats (Mays, 1969). Sexual dimorphism in hematocrit, hemoglobin, total leukocyte count, and lymphocytes has been reported (Dillon and Glomski, 1975; Mays, 1969). Mays (1969) demonstrated that there were significant differences between males and females in phosphorus and uric acid levels. Serum cholesterol levels are higher than other rodents, even when gerbils are fed diets containing normal levels of fat (Roscoe and Fahrenbach, 1962).",

In nature, gerbils live in family groups in complex burrows. Their compulsive burrowing behavior extends into the laboratory setting as well, and in many cases they will scratch at the sides and bottoms of cages in their attempts to burrow (Brain, 1999, Field and Sibold, 1999). Other normal activities include gnawing, making nests, and nibbling on food continually to support their bursts of energy (Bradley and Pence, 1995). While primarily nocturnal, they are active during daylight hours, too, alternating periods of intense activity with sleep or rest (Brain, 1999; Thiessen and Yahr, 1977). They do not hibernate, but may exhibit estivation, depending on the species (Bradley and Pence, 1995).",

This enlarged, specialized gland is under the control of gonadal hormones (Glenn and Gray, 1965). Animals of both sexes which have higher androgen levels are more frequent markers and have an advantage in hostile encounters (Swanson et al., 1978; Thiessen et al., 1968a). In males, the gonadal androgens act on the medial preoptic area of the brain (Commins and Yahr, 1984, Thiessen and Yahr, 1970). In the female there is contradictory information regarding the influence of estrogen and progesterone on marking behavior (Thiessen and Lindzey, 1970, Wallace et al., 1973, Whitsett and Thiessen, 1972). Male gerbils scent mark more frequently than females (Lindzey and Carbonell, 1968) and gerbils with black coat color tend to mark more often than those with brown coat color (Turner and Carbonell, 1984). Marking behavior in males is used for exploration, establishing social dominance, and identifying territory (Thiessen and Yahr, 1970). In females, scent marking is used for exploration and is also important for identification and for the attraction between mother and young (Dagg and Windsor, 1971; Wallace et al., 1973). Males also urinate and defecate to mark their territory. Only groups of males that are raised together are compatible as adults and will defend their territory as a group. Once a family unit (male and female, or parents with a litter) is established, the gerbils will viciously attack intruders.",

A 12-h light: 12-h dark cycle is appropriate for general housing, but a longer 14-h light: 10-h dark cycle is desirable for breeding colonies (Field and Sibold, 1999, Moore, 1995). Cold temperatures and/or short light cycles (e.g. 5\u00b0C, 8-h light: 16-h dark) may elicit physiological changes related to winter survival mechanisms such as increased basal metabolic rate and non-shivering thermogenesis (Li and Wang, 2005). Relative humidity should be maintained at 30\u201370% RH; however, rough hair coats have been reported to occur at humidity levels greater than 50% RH (Field and Sibold, 1999; Harkness and Wagner, 1983; Moore, 1995). Housing areas should be kept quiet, because sudden noises may elicit epileptic seizures.

However, it has been suggested that providing shelters may result in differences in behavior, maturation rate, and adrenal weights (Moore, 1995). Nesting material is used readily but may be chewed and incorporated into the cage bedding. Heavier material such as thick cardboard tubing can provide shelter and a chewing substrate which will last longer than other nesting materials (Batchelder, personal communication). Naturalistic environmental enrichment such as sand and stones has been recommended. Sand or deep bedding allow expression of the animals\u2019 burrowing behaviors (Field and Sibold, 1999).

Diets should contain at least 16% protein. Harkness and Wagner (1983) recommend 22% protein and 2\u20135% dietary fat. Gerbils appear to have a higher need for magnesium than rats, as levels below 1 g/kg diet may result in alopecia and increased susceptibility to seizures; 1.5 g/kg diet is recommended. Gerbils are also susceptible to developing elevated blood and liver cholesterol when fed an excess of fat or cholesterol in the diet (Brain, 1999, Subcommittee on Laboratory Animal Nutrition, 1995).

The male is distinguished by its longer anogenital distance, prominent genital papilla, and pigmented scrotum (Figure 52.2). Gerbils become sexually mature at 9\u201312 weeks of age. Females have a 4\u20136-day estrous cycle and are spontaneous ovulators. They are sexually receptive for 12\u201315 hours, and mating often occurs several times. Males thump their feet as a courtship display. A vaginal plug is present after ejaculation, but usually disappears by the following morning (Brain, 1999). Gestation is 24\u201326 days, and litter size averages five pups (range 1\u201312). Larger litters may necessitate fostering some of the pups to another lactating female gerbil or even to a lactating rat (Brain, 1999, Moore, 1995). Both parents participate in building a nest and caring for the young, although during post-partum estrus the male may be more interested in mating than in child-rearing (Prates and Guerra, 2005). Arrington et al. (1973) reported that 47% of females become pregnant at this time. As in mice, gestation during lactation may be prolonged due to delayed implantation (Brain, 1999; Norris and Adams, 1981). Pups are about 2.5 g at birth, are altricial, begin eating solid food at about 14 days of age, and are weaned when they reach 21\u201324 days of age. Handling and cage changing should be minimized during the breeding and peri-partum periods to reduce the chance of females abandoning their pups.",

After the loss of one mate, it may be difficult to introduce a new one to the survivor (Norris and Adams, 1972a). Pairs are usually established at about 6\u20137 weeks of age (Moore, 1995), although Brain (1999) suggests animals reproduce sooner if paired at 2\u20133 months of age. Animals may fight or fail to mate if they were not previously housed together. Females which mature earlier (vaginal opening before 25 days of age) have been reported to be more productive breeders than later-maturing females (Brain, 1999). Female gerbils housed as a single-sex group show decreased incidence of estrus whereas pairing with a male will result in estrus by day 3 in 44% of females (Meckley and Ginther, 1974). Pseudopregnancy has been known to occur, lasting a shorter period (14\u201318 days) than pregnancy (Brain, 1999). Gerbils have a relatively high incidence of cystic ovaries which may affect breeding production (Norris and Adams, 1972b).

This structure provides for alternate blood flow to the brain in case one artery becomes occluded. Levine and Payan (1966) first identified gerbils as having an anatomical anomaly of the circle of Willis with no communication between the posterior cerebral arteries. This has been termed an incomplete circle of Willis. Researchers found that ligating the left carotid artery of the gerbil caused acute cerebral ischemia much more consistently than when performing the same ligation in the rat (Wexler, 1972). In 1974, Levy and Brierley performed a study on gerbils to assess the cerebrovascular anatomy and communications in the gerbil brain by injecting colored dye into the aorta. Based on evaluating ten male gerbils from an unspecified source, these authors concluded that each of the gerbil\u2019s carotid arteries is divided into an anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral artery. They found that the basilar artery communicated with the carotid artery in all gerbils, that the posterior cerebral artery was a branch of the carotid, and that there was no single posterior communicating artery.",

Gerbils are also commonly used for studies of infectious otitis media. In the induced model the gerbils are usually infected with Streptococcus pneumoniae (Soriano et al., 2000), although Haemophilus influenza (Ponte et al., 1999) and Moraxella catarrhallis (Fulghum and Marrow, 1996) have also been used.",
