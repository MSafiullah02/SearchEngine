            "text": "Additionally, most of the previous research has focused on continuous modeling. In this research, we will adopt discrete-time modeling where statistical data are collected at a discrete-time (day, week, month, and year). Treatment and vaccination of some patients are also given at a discrete-time. Therefore, it is more direct, more convenient, and more accurate to describe a phenomena using discrete time modeling compared to continuous time modeling. The use of discrete-time models may avoid some mathematical complications such as the choice of the area of function and uniformity of the solution. Thus, difference equations appear as a more natural way to describe epidemiological models. Moreover, numerical solutions are used for discretionary differential equations and this encourages us to employ the difference equations directly. The numerical exploration of discrete time models is easy, and therefore can be easily implemented by mathematicians [7, 15\u201318].",

Throughout this research, we seek to find the optimal strategies to minimize the number of the exposed humans, the infected humans and the infected animals and also to maximize the number of the exposed humans who will join quarantine centers. In order to achieve this purpose, we use optimal control strategies associated with four types of controls: the first represents awareness campaigns in region j that aim at introducing health measures to protect individuals from being infected by the virus. The second represents security campaigns and health measures to prevent the movement of individuals from one region to another. The third represents the effort to encourage the exposed humans to join quarantine centers. The forth control represents the disposal of the infected animals.",

The strategies that we introduced include four controls: the first represents awareness programs, the second represents health measures and security campaigns, the third represents the effort to encourage the exposed individuals and the infected individuals to join quarantine centers and the forth control represents the disposal of the infected animals. Pontryagin\u2019s maximum principle in discrete time was used to characterize the optimal controls and the optimality system was solved by an iterative method. The numerical simulation was carried out using Matlab. Numerically, the optimal control strategies that include protectiing individuals from being infected by the virus, security campaigns and health measures to prevent the movement of individuals from one region to another, encouraging the individuals to join quarantine centers and the disposal of infected animals (Strategies 1, 2, 3 and 4) showed significant differences in the number of the exposed humans, infected humans, quarantined humans and infected animals compared to the case where controls are not used. Using cost-effectiveness analysis, we showed that strategy 3 (protecting susceptible individuals, preventing their contact with the infected individuals and encouraging the exposed individuals to join quarantine centers) is the optimal and the most effective strategies.",
