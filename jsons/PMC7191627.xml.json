The only treatment of COVID-19 is supportive (51), and registered clinical trials are ongoing. The mechanisms for high morbidity and mortality of patients with comorbidities are unknown. The existence of significantly increased fibrin degradation products (FDPs) and reduced platelets in severe COVID-19 patients is consistent with the presence of hyperfibrinolysis. This opinion is supported by the presence of hemorrhage in multiple organs and a positive correlation between fibrinolysis and mortality. Plasmin, a key player in fibrinolysis, enhances the virulence and pathogenicity of viruses containing a furin site in their envelope proteins, as is the case with the SARS-CoV-2. The purpose of this review is to summarize the clinical and preclinical evidence for the existence of elevated plasmin(ogen) in these comorbid conditions of COVID-19 and to highlight the importance of plasmin-induced proteolytic cleavage of the SARS-COV-2 S protein and fibrin in the development of COVID-19.",

Many patients with COVID-19 develop multi-organ failure (MOF). The leading causes of deaths are ARDS, septic shock with MOF, hemorrhage/coagulopathy (disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, DIC), acute heart/liver/kidney injury, and secondary bacterial infections (97, 101). Elevated FDPs and D-dimers were detected predominantly in patients with severe disease (11, 24, 31, 43, 45, 79, 85). Multivariate regression further suggests that age and D-dimer levels (>1 mg/L) are two independent risk factors for mortality (89, 101). This in addition to other factors, such as compromised immune response, may contribute to the increased morbidity and mortality of patients with COVID-19 who are older than 60 years.",

In the early stages of infection, puncture lung biopsies reveal the presence of pneumonia, edema, proteinaceous exudate with globules and focal hyperplasia of alveolar epithelial cells associated with patchy inflammatory infiltrates, and multinucleated giant cells (81). At the later stages, diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) is observed in addition to hemorrhage and some areas of interstitial fibrosis (48). Fibrotic clots and gelatinous mucus in the small airways and disseminated intravascular coagulation are also present (44, 93). Consistent with clinical observations, the lungs are the most injured organs, followed by moderate injury in the heart, liver, kidney, and brain. Systemic microthrombi in the circulatory system and hemorrhage in the affected organs result from noncoordinated responses between the coagulation and fibrinolysis systems. Although COVID-19 is characterized by hyperfibrinolysis, as evidenced by elevated levels of D-dimer, studies attempting to restore fibrinolytic function have not been reported. Elevated plasmin(ogen) in patients with preexisting conditions may be a mechanism contributing to enhanced susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and fatality.",

This increases the ability of the viruses to enter host cells (13, 34, 56). Proteolysis at a conventional \u201cXXXR/S\u201d motif in the S2 region of the Spike protein may facilitate the entry of respiratory infectious viruses (such as RSV and influenza) into airway and alveolar epithelial cells (94). Both SARS and MERS have evolved an unusual two-step furin activation for fusion, suggestive of a role during the process of emergence into the human population (55). Amidst the cluster of the furin-cleaved viruses, SARS S protein is cleaved by airway proteases (trypsin, plasmin, and TMPRSS11a), expressed in human bronchial epithelial cells, subsequently enhancing pseudovirus entry via binding host ACE2 receptors (37). The protease cleavage sites are R667 in the S1 fragment and R797 in the S2 fragment of SARS virus. These two cleavage sites are preserved in other coronaviruses, HIV, human and avian influenza virus, human CMV and RSV, yellow fever virus, and Zika virus (13).",

Plasminogen is also expressed in endothelial cells. Cytosolic furin is enriched in the Golgi apparatus. The possibility for non-furin proteases to cleave viral envelope proteins is supported by the evidence that in furin-defective LoVo cells, the cleavage-dependent process of HIV gp160 is as efficient as in normal cell lines (60). We have demonstrated that plasmin is capable of cleaving furin sites in the \u03b3 subunit of human epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) (99).",

Acidification of the endosome promotes viral membrane fusion and activates the M2 ion channel, which pumps protons (H1) into the interior of the viral core to initiate uncoating of the M1 protein. Nuclear replication occurs, and viral gene products are transported to the plasma membrane for assembly. The fibrinolytic zymogen plasminogen (activated by urokinase or tissue-like plasminogen activator to generate plasmin) has been shown to cleave the influenza HA proteins (40, 75, 83). The HA cleavage site of A/WSN/1933 H1N1 influenza virus governs virus spread in a plasmin-dependent manner (75). Mini-plasmin, a plasmin fragment, is distributed predominantly in the epithelial cells of the bronchioles and potentiates the replication of both plasmin-sensitive and plasmin-insensitive influenza A virus strains, suggesting a pivotal role of plasmin in the spread and pathogenicity of the influenza virus (57). Additionally, kallikreins cleave and activate HA of the influenza virus H1, H2, and H3 subtypes (27). Similar to coronavirus and influenza viruses, plasmin, trypsin, thrombin, and furin enhance RSV-induced cytopathology (17). Local fibrin and clot formation are implicated in host defense against influenza virus infections (5), thus plasminogen may affect lung injury and repair by interfering with these processes (1).",

In general, uPA is responsible for the plasmin in body fluid (BAL, urine, tear, pleural effusion, etc.), while circulating tPA proteolytically cleaves plasminogen in the plasma. The most frequent comorbidity observed in COVID-19 patients is hypertension followed by diabetes, chronic cardiovascular conditions, cerebrovascular diseases, COPD, and chronic kidney illnesses (80, 101). The plasminogen system is a druggable target in renal hypertension (76). Plasmin, a potent protease, cleaves up to 16 sites, including the cleavage sites for trypsin, chymotrypsin, prostasin, and elastases, of the human \u03b3 ENaC subunit (99). Elevated renal plasmin results in hypertension by cleaving ENaC in the collecting tubule, which increases salt retention, causing expanded circulating volume. Urinary excretion of plasmin(ogen) and urokinase directly correlates with urine albumin in hypertensive subjects (2). On the other hand, amiloride, an inhibitor of ENaC, lowers blood pressure and urine plasminogen excretion (61). ENaC proteins are located in the apical membranes of tight epithelia, and they are the major pathways for the entry of Na+. As such, they play an important role in maintaining the proper depth of airway and alveolar lining fluids, the reabsorption of edema fluid in injured lungs, and the regulation of salt retention in the collecting tubules (6, 14, 18, 28, 38, 39, 50, 64). Proteolysis is an important regulatory mechanism of ENaC function (36, 63, 65, 67, 70, 99). Decreased ENaC function will result in increased fluid in body cavities (e.g., lung edema in the airspaces and increased blood volume), while increased function will cause dehydration of luminal fluid, as it occurs in cystic fibrosis (CF) and most likely dry eye syndrome.",

Elevated urine plasmin(ogen) levels, accompanied by increased exosomal \u03b1 ENaC fragments, have been detected in pregnant women (59), a population susceptible to influenza (22). Endogenous channel-activating proteases, as well as proteases released by inflammatory cells (trypsin, elastase), activate ENaC either by cleaving critical amino acids in \u03b1 and \u03b3 ENaC subunits, or by activating signaling pathways (66, 72). Aprotinin, a potent and reversible Kunitz-type inhibitor of several serine proteases, including trypsin, plasmin, and kallikreins, has been reported to inhibit sodium transport among a variety of epithelial cells (66). Other Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitors, such as hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor (HAI)-1 and HAI-2 (placental bikunin), have also been demonstrated to inhibit prostasin and ENaC activity (77). Finally, a1-antitrypsin, an acute-phase glycoprotein and a member of the serine protease inhibitor (SERPIN) superfamily, inhibits ENaC in vitro and in vivo by decreasing protease activity (41). Of note, SARS S protein inhibits ENaC via the protein kinase C signaling pathway (35). It is worth noting that high plasmin levels may contribute to the development of comorbid bacteremia and sepsis (26, 74). Interestingly, azithromycin, a common antibiotic for suppressing infection in the CF airways when combined with hydroxychloroquine, turns COVID-19 to SARS-CoV-2 negative in 5 days (21).",

In addition to lung injury, patients with ARDS may develop MOF with a hallmark of excess D-dimer and other FDPs presenting in both BAL and blood biopsies. Soluble D-dimer and D-monomer are predominately produced from the proteolytic cleavage of cross-linked fibrin and fibrinogen/non-cross-linked fibrin, respectively, by plasmin (fibrinolysis). Plasmin activity in BAL is detected in healthy subjects (71). Both D-dimer and D-monomer levels are significantly increased up to 17-fold in undiluted edema fluid in patients with ARDS (68). Significant increase in both plasminogen and cleaved plasmin protein in the BAL of ARDS patients (32) and an animal model of DAD (33) have been reported. Augmented plasmin activity contributes to elevated D-dimer in the BAL of infected lungs in a time-dependent manner during the development of ARDS (20, 87). This is further validated by the observation that plasmin-mediated fibrinolytic activity could be inhibited by 50% with \u03b12-antiplasmin antibody (32). Kallikrein and neutrophil elastase may contribute to the residual proteolytic activity in BAL of ARDS (53). Also, radiation-induced lung injury in mesothelioma patients is accompanied by a significant elevation in BAL plasminogen and plasmin-associated fibrinolytic activity (49).",

Some patients have more than one, even up to five preexisting conditions. Multivariate regression further links hypertension with increased incidence and fatality (85, 89, 101). Hyperfibrinolysis, reflected by elevated serum D-dimer levels, was present in 97% of COVID-19 patients at admission and increased further in all patients before death (TABLE 2) (97). FDPs were significantly increased as well (79). This is accompanied by a prolonged prothrombin time particularly in non-survivors (31, 79, 97, 101). Platelet counts were decreased significantly in severe and dead patients (79, 97, 101). 71.4% of non-survivors meet the criteria of the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) for DIC, suggesting the coexistence of coagulation activation and hyperfibrinolysis in patients with severe COVID-19 infection (78, 85). In contrast, D-dimer levels decreased to control levels in survivors or non-ARDS patients.",

Increased levels of \u03b12-antiplasmin and other antiproteases may not completely shield the proteolytic triad of plasmin in the complexes, suggesting that either their efficacy is inadequate or that plasmin is still able to cut fibrin to produce D-dimers and FDPs in ARDS patients. The soluble complexes of the plasmin-antiplasmin in BAL may facilitate physical interactions with the vast deposition of fibrin at the luminal surface of alveoli. Based on the pathology and laboratory results, dynamic hypercoagulation occurs as evidenced by microthrombi throughout the blood vessels of multiple organs, accompanied with extremely reduced platelets in COVID-19 patients (TABLE 2). On the other hand, hemorrhage and markedly elevated degraded fibrin products result from plasmin-associated hyperproteolysis. Whether patchy hemorrhage coexists with areas infected by SARS-CoV-2 is not known. Administration of anti-proteases may prove beneficial.",

Elevated plasmin(ogen) levels are a common feature in COVID-19 patients with underlying medical conditions. The elevated plasmin(ogen) could be an independent factor for risk stratification of patients with COVID-19. Measurements of plasmin(ogen) levels and its enzymatic activity may be important biomarkers of disease severity in addition to resultant D-dimer. The administration of antiproteases to suppress plasmin activity in the respiratory system may prevent, or at least decrease, SARS-CoV-2 entry into respiratory cells and improve the clinical outcome of patients with COVID-19. As demonstrated in vitro, a serine protease inhibitor for TMPRSS2 blocks SARS-CoV-2 S protein-driven entry into cells (30). Clinical trials conducted in China are testing various protease inhibitors (29). Currently there are no proper animal models of COVID-19 with underlying medical conditions to test new therapeutic agents. Healthy mice and monkeys infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop either mild lung injury or show no symptoms of disease (8). It remains to be seen whether mice and monkeys with preexisting comorbid conditions and higher plasmin levels develop COVID-19 when infected with SARS-CoV-2. Targeting hyperfibrinolysis with a broad spectrum or specific anti-plasmin compounds may prove to be a promising strategy for improving the clinical outcome of patients with comorbid conditions.",

Plasmin proteolytically breaks down excess fibrin to elevate D-dimer and other fibrin degradation products in both bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and plasma, which decreases platelets and results in hemorrhage. Plasmin also cleaves epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) subunits, located at the apical membranes of epithelial cells in the airway, lung, and kidney.
