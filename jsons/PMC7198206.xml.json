These findings are similar to those reported during the SARS outbreak (Cheng, Wong, Tsang, & Wong, 2004) and in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic (Rubin, Aml\u00f4t, Page, & Wessely, 2009). Studies of previous epidemics and pandemics show that anxiety, or the lack thereof, is an important driver of behavior (Taylor, 2019). People with too little anxiety about a viral outbreak are less likely to engage in hygiene behaviors (e.g., handwashing), less likely to adhere to physical distancing mandates, and are less likely to get vaccinated if a vaccine is available (Taylor, 2019). On the other hand, people with excessive anxiety are more likely to engage in socially disruptive behaviors, such as panic buying and surging unnecessarily into hospitals and clinics when they misinterpret their minor ailments as signs of serious infection (Asmundson & Taylor, 2020a, 2020b).",

To date, there has been little empirical attention devoted to this issue; indeed, while several measures of COVID-19-related fears have recently emerged (e.g., Ahorsu et al., 2020), they tend to be unidimensional (i.e., focused on general fear aspects of COVID-19) and are based on limited psychometric evaluation. There is a pressing need to develop an empirically-sound measure of COVID-19-related stress and anxiety-related symptoms.",

The COVID-19 Stress Scales (CSS) were developed to measure the aforementioned features as well as to better understand and assess COVID-19-related psychopathology. The scales were intentionally designed so they could be readily adapted for future pandemics. In the present study we examined the factor structure, reliability as internal consistency, and convergent and discriminant validity of the CSS. To determine the robustness (replicability) of the findings, results from a Canadian sample were replicated in an American sample.",

Participation was solicited by Qualtrics using sampling of web-panels to meet quotas based on age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and geographic region within each country in order to obtain a population representative sample. Filters were used to eliminate data from careless or incomplete responders. The final sample comprised 6,854 adults (United States: 3,375; Canada: 3,479). Respondents were aged 18-94 years (M = 49.8 years, SD = 16.2). Almost half (47%) were female and most (52.3%) were employed full- or part-time. A total of 10.1% were on leave or unemployed, 25.0% were retired, 4.3% were homemakers, and 4.4% were students. Most (78.8%) had completed full or partial college, 17.6% had only completed high school or equivalent, and 2.9% did not graduate from high school. Most (68.1%) were Caucasian, with the remainder being Asian (11.5%), African American/Black (9.4%), Latino/Hispanic (6.4%), Native American/Indigenous (1.4%), or other (3.2%).",

That is, Maximum Likelihood using robust standard errors. RML was used because it is robust to departures from normality in the data distribution. For each scale, parallel analysis (Patil, Singh, Mishra, & Donavan, 2017) indicated a single factor. That is, each scale had a single underlying factor. For the factor for each scale, the items with the six highest loadings were retained. This resulted in the creation of six 6-item scales. Six items were selected because we had previously found, in studies of other anxiety-related phenomena, that 6-item subscales provided a good balance between brevity and reliability (Taylor et al., 2007). Item selection was replicated across countries; that is, for each scale, the items with the top six loadings in the Canadian sample were the same as the items with the top six loadings in the United States sample (see supplement).",

A stable 5-factor solution was identified, corresponding to five scales assessing COVID-19 stress and anxiety symptoms: (1) COVID danger and contamination fears, (2) COVID fears about economic consequences, (3) COVID xenophobia, (4) COVID compulsive checking, and (5) COVID traumatic stress symptoms. The scales performed well on various indices of reliability and validity. The scales were intercorrelated, loading on a single higher-order factor, thereby providing evidence of a COVID-19 Stress Syndrome. The scales offer promise as tools for better understanding the psychopathology associated with COVID-19 and for identifying people in need of mental health services. The CSS can also be used in studies to predict which people are most likely to engage in safety behaviors. For example, the CSS could be used to investigate which people are most likely to engage in hygiene behaviors, social distancing, and the uptake of a vaccine, when one becomes available.",

These predictions are based on prior pandemics, where anxiety, depression, and traumatic reactions were observed (such as following quarantine due to SARS; Hawryluck et al., 2004; Taylor, 2019). Accordingly, the development of a pandemic-specific measure such as the CSS can serve to aid in identifying individuals at risk for adverse emotional reactions both during and post-pandemic. This can then aid public health officials in allocating resources for mental health interventions. The measure can also be further investigated for its predictive utility for returning to functioning post-pandemic. This is also, to our knowledge, the first assessment of pandemic-related emotional responses that includes specific evaluation of xenophobia as a contributory factor in fear and avoidance. This is an important consideration in any preparation for public health officials in addressing emotional and behavioral responses to potential pandemics. The role of xenophobic reactions, in conjunction with other emotional indicators such as those identified in the CSS (i.e., COVID danger and contamination, COVID socioeconomic consequences, COVID traumatic stress, and COVID checking and reassurance seeking) deserves additional investigation, such as with individuals at risk for post-pandemic adverse reactions.",

It would be predicted that scores on the CSS would be higher in people with current anxiety-related disorders (e.g., generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder), as compared to nonclinical controls. Future research is needed to investigate this issue. A further limitation was that we were unable to compare the CSS to other COVID-related anxiety measures (e.g., Mertens et al., in press), because the latter scales had not been published when we were conducting our study. Despite these limitations, the present findings provide encouraging support for the CSS as a brief, multidimensional measure of COVID-related stress and anxiety.",

Additional research involving expanded breadth of content may provide incremental increases in the validity of the CSS. Likewise, additional methods of assessment, such as interviews to evaluate the scope of avoidance and the inclusion of new safety behaviors, may reveal additional indicators of emotional responses to pandemic response. Notwithstanding these limitations, the introduction of a robust instrument to assess COVOD-19-related stress reactions, developed and evaluated with a large bi-national community sample during the peak period of COVID-19, is of considerable importance. It is expected that the CSS will lead to important new empirical findings on the nature of reactions to COVID-19 in particular and future pandemics in general.",
