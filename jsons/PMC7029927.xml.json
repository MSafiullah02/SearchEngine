Among ecological forces shaping such ecosystems, pathogen\u2013pathogen interactions have drawn increasing attention during recent years owing to their population-level impact and public health consequences. Recent advances in serological tests and genotyping techniques have improved our reconstruction of pathogen populations where multiple strains co-circulate, often competing owing to cross-protection or mutual exclusion. Examples include tuberculosis [1,2], Plasmodium falciparum [3], Streptococcus pneumoniae [4,5] and Staphylococcus aureus [6,7]. Polymorphic strains can also interact in more complex ways, with both competition and cooperation acting simultaneously, as observed in co-circulating dengue serotypes [8]. While interfering with each other, strains also interact with other pathogens co-circulating in the same population. Tuberculosis [1], human papillomavirus (HPV) [9] and P. falciparum [10], for example, appear to be facilitated by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), whereas Str. pneumoniae benefits from some bacterial infections, e.g. Moraxella catarrhalis, and is negatively associated with others such as Sta. aureus [11,12]. Competition, cooperation and their co-occurrence may fundamentally alter pathogen persistence and diversity, thus calling for a deep understanding of these forces and their quantitative effects on spreading processes.",

            "text": "Mathematical models represent a powerful tool to assess the validity and impact of mechanistic hypotheses about interactions between pathogens or pathogenic strains [13,14]. The literature on competitive interactions is centred on pathogen dominance and coexistence. Several factors were found to affect the ecological outcome of the competition, including co-infection mechanisms [15\u201318], host age structure [19,20], contact network [21\u201332] and spatial organization [33\u201338]. At the same time, models investigating cooperative interactions have driven many research efforts during recent years [39\u201345]. Cooperation has been found to trigger abrupt transitions between disease extinction and large scale outbreaks along with hysteresis phenomena where the eradication threshold is lower than the epidemic threshold [39,40,43]. These findings were related to the high burden of synergistic infections, e.g. the HIV and tuberculosis co-circulation in many parts of the world. Despite considerable mathematical and computationally heavy research on interacting pathogens, competition and cooperation have been studied mostly separately. Nevertheless, current understandings about these mechanisms taken in isolation may fail to describe the dynamics arising from their joint interplay, where heterogeneous interactions may shape the phase diagram of coexistence/dominance outcome, along with the epidemic prevalence.",

A and B cooperate in a symmetric way through increased susceptibility, i.e. a primary infection by one of the two increases the susceptibility to a secondary infection by the other pathogen. We assumed that the cooperative interaction does not affect infectivity, thus doubly infected individuals, i.e. infected with both A and B, transmit both diseases at their respective infection rates. B is structured in two strains, B1 and B2, that compete through mutual exclusion (co-infection with B1 and B2 is impossible) and differ in epidemiological traits. Specifically, we denoted the infection rates for pathogens A and Bi with \u03b1 and \u03b2i (i = 1, 2), respectively. We introduced the parameters ci > 1 to represent the increased susceptibility after a primary infection. In summary, individuals can be in either one of six states: susceptible (S), singly infected (A, Bi) and doubly infected with both A and Bi. The latter status is denoted by Di.\n",

Finally, we will apply the proposed model to contact networks, where nodes represent individuals and transmission occurs through links, and consider transmission and recovery as stochastic processes. Two types of networks will be tested: Erd\u0151s\u2013R\u00e9nyi and random modular networks (figure 1d).",

Results that are obtained for other parameter values are reported in the electronic supplementary material, figure S1. No coexistence was found between B1 and B2. In principle, equations (2.1) admit a coexistence equilibrium [A&B1&B2]. However, this coexistence was always found to be unstable in the numerical simulations. Persistence of A is only possible together with one of the B strains. The equilibrium solution [A] is unfeasible for \u03b1 < 1 and unstable for \u03b1 > 1, unless both reproductive ratios, \u03b2i, are below the epidemic threshold. Because of the assumption \u03b4\u03b2 > 0, B2 outcompetes B1 in absence of A, in agreement with the principle of competitive exclusion. Therefore, the final state [B1] is always unstable, and persistence of B1 is possible only in co-circulation with A. On the other hand, B2 can spread either alone or together with A. Specifically, the [B2] configuration is feasible for \u03b22 > 1. It is stable if and only if \u03b1 < \u03b1c, with3.1\u03b1c=\u03b22c2(\u03b22\u22121)+1.This provides a sufficient condition for the persistence of A.

As a consequence, for a fixed \u03b4\u03b2, a first transition from the [A&B2] state to [A&B1] is found for small \u03b4c values. An increase of \u03b4c leads to a second boundary with a bistable region, where the dominance of B1 over B2 depends on initial conditions. The transition for small \u03b4c is expected: by increasing B1\u2019s advantage in cooperation, a point is reached beyond which B1\u2019s disadvantage in transmissibility is overcome. On the other hand, the second threshold appears to be counterintuitive. We investigated it more in depth for the case depicted in figure 2a. We plotted the infectious population curves as a function of time for each infectious compartment. We compared \u03b4c = 0.5, which corresponds to the [A&B1] stable state (figure 2c top), and \u03b4c = 1.5, which leads to a bistable region (figure 2c bottom), where all other parameters are as in figure 2a. Figure 2c shows that B1 loses the competition at the beginning. However, when B2 is sufficiently cooperative with A (top), the rise of B2 leads to a rise in A that ultimately drives B1 to dominate. For higher \u03b4c, the strength of cooperation between B2 and A is not sufficient. The indirect beneficial effect of B2 over B1 is not present (bottom), and B1 can dominate only if initial conditions are favourable.",

While a mathematical analysis is complicated owing to the multi-dimensionality of the problem, we gained insights into the basins of attraction by numerically integrating equation (2.1) while exploring different combinations of Bi(t = 0) and A(t = 0). For the bistability between the regions of B1 and B2 dominance, we considered the parameter combination of figure 2a and shown in figure 3a the states that are reached starting from Bi(t = 0) = 0.001 and A(t = 0) = 0.01. The bundle of curves with different shades of red (from light to dark) indicates the boundary of the [A&B1] equilibrium when B1(t = 0) and B2(t = 0) are equally increased. We found that an increase in B1\u2019s initial infected densities favours the [A&B1] state, as expected. Interestingly, however, an increase in B1(t = 0) results in the [A&B1] region expanding even when B2\u2019s density increases at the same level. Figure 3b shows that a similar behaviour is found when parameters are as in figure 2b. In this case, the region [A&B2] expands together with the [A&B1] one. Thus, increased initial frequencies promote co-circulation between B and A. In the electronic supplementary material, figure S2, we present a deeper exploration of initial conditions, considering the parameter combination of figure 2a as an example. We found that an increase in the initial level of A also favours B1. However, the initial advantage (either in B1(0) or A(0)) that is necessary for B1 to win against B2 increases as \u03b4\u03b2 increases.\n",

Figure 5b,c show that the incidence of A remains close to zero, until the incidence of B1 is sufficiently high. With B2 seeded on a different community (community 2), the direct interaction between the two strains is delayed by the time necessary for B2 to reach the community of B1. For high \u03b5, the delay is short and B2 reaches community 1 before A incidence starts to rise (figure 5a). On the other hand, for lower \u03b5, B1 has enough time to build up a cooperative protection before the arrival of B2. This makes it resistant to the invader. At intermediate \u03b5, B1 becomes able to overcome B2 in community 2. For small \u03b5, strains spread in their origin community independently from one another.\n",

Possible individual states are still the same as in the mean-field formulation, and infection can spread only between neighbouring nodes. We first considered an Erd\u0151s\u2013R\u00e9nyi graph, where the mixing is homogeneous across nodes. Denoting N the number of nodes and k\u00af the average degree, the network was built by connecting any two nodes with probability k\u00af/(N\u22121). We run stochastic simulations of the dynamics. In order to see the effect of multi-pathogen interactions, we minimized the chance of initial stochastic extinction by infecting a relatively high number of nodes at the beginning: 100 infected for each infectious agent. We then computed the fraction of stochastic simulations ending up in any final state, the average prevalence for each strain (X1, X2) in the final state and the average coexistence time.

Three final states are possible, i.e. [B2], [A&B1] and [A&B2] (figure 6a). Here, however, the same initial conditions and parameter values can lead to different stochastic trajectories and stationary states. For instance, the red region in the figure corresponds to the case in which the final state [A&B1] is reached very frequently; however, the dynamic trajectories can also end up in the [A&B2] or in the [B2] states. The transitions across the different regions of the diagrams can be very different, as demonstrated by figure 6b\u2013j. Figure 6b\u2013d shows the effect of varying \u03b4c at a fixed \u03b4\u03b2. The transition between [A&B2] and [A&B1] on the left is sharp. Both the probability of one strain winning over the other and the equilibrium prevalence change abruptly for a critical value of \u03b4c. Here, the spreading is super-critical for all pathogens: \u03b21, \u03b22 > 1 and c1, c2 are sufficiently high to sustain the spread of A. The transition is owing to the trade-off between B1 and B2 growth rates. Conversely, the probability of ending up in the [B2] state rises slowly, driving the gradual transition from the red to the light blue region on the right. This region appears in correspondence of the bistable region of the continuous/deterministic diagram: figure 2. Here, A undergoes a transition from persistence to extinction, driven by the drop in c2 (electronic supplementary material, figure S6). This critical regime is characterized by enhanced stochastic fluctuations. When \u03b4c is fixed and \u03b4\u03b2 varies, we found a sharp transition (figure 6e\u2013g) and a hybrid transition, where the final state probability varies gradually and the equilibrium prevalence (X1) varies abruptly (figure 6h\u2013j).\n",

The dynamical mechanisms underlying this outcome are complex. We analysed a case with a small difference in cooperativity, and we found that the more transmissible strain, by spreading initially faster, creates the bulk of A infections that in turn favour its competitor. In other words, direct competition for susceptible hosts is not the only force acting between strains: an indirect, beneficial interaction is also at play, mediated by the other pathogen. The dominance outcome is thus the result of the trade-off between these two forces. When the difference in cooperation is higher, two or more stationary configurations are possible. In this scenario, the final outcome is also determined by the initial frequency of each pathogen/strain. We found that, in certain situations, an initial advantage of one strain is able to drive it to dominance. This is in contrast with simpler models of competition, where the final outcome is determined solely by the epidemiological traits. The outcome, however, is also governed by pathogen A that favours the more cooperative strain. Previous works have analysed multistability in two-pathogen models with cooperation in relation to the hysteresis phenomenon, where the eradication threshold is lower than the epidemic one [39,42,43]. A similar mechanism could be at play here. However, the identification of hysteresis loops requires a better reconstruction of the attraction basins. While the numerical work presented here provided some preliminary understanding, a deeper mathematical analysis would be needed in this direction. Multistability is, instead, not present in two-pathogen models with a complete mutual exclusion. This dynamical feature emerges, however, in the more general case where strains are allowed to interact upon co-infection [15].",

In this case, strains can minimize competition for hosts through segregation. Importantly, spatial separation alone is not sufficient to enable coexistence between two strains, when complete mutual exclusion is assumed. This was already known from previous works which showed that community structure must be combined with some level of heterogeneity across communities to enable coexistence, e.g. a strain-specific adaptation to a population or environment to create an ecological niche [35,37,46\u201348]. Here, communities are homogeneous and coexistence is the result of the interplay between community structure and presence of the cooperative pathogen. When the two strains are seeded in different communities, their interaction occurs after the time lag necessary for one strain to invade the other community. We found that this interval may allow the resident strain to reach the bulk of infections necessary to fend off the invasion. This mechanism is rooted again in the effect of pathogens\u2019 frequencies on strain selective advantage. The drivers of strains\u2019 coexistence remain an important problem in disease ecology with applications to both vaccination and emergence of anti-microbial resistance. Within-host and population factors have been studied in the past by several modelling investigations. Notably, while coexistence is not possible in models with complete mutual exclusion, this may be enabled in co-infection models [15\u201318,49]. Other models have addressed environmental and host population features, such as age structure, contact dynamics and spatial organization [19\u201321,36]. However, little attention has been dedicated to the effect of an additional co-circulating pathogen. Cobey et al. studied the interaction between Haemophilus influenzae and Str. pneumoniae co-circulating strains [50]. Despite the numerous differences between our model and theirs, their work provides results consistent with ours. Namely, the multi-strain dynamics can be affected by another pathogen.",

The discrete/stochastic framework, however, allows for observation of the nature of the phase transitions. Several works recently studied the nature of the epidemic transition for two cooperating pathogens, highlighting differences with the single-pathogen case. Cooperation was found to cause discontinuous transitions where the probability of an outbreak and prevalence change abruptly around a critical value of the transmission rate [40,43], akin to other complex contagion mechanisms such as the ones found in social contagion [51,52]. This phenomenon, however, is sensitive to the network topology, with continuous, discontinuous and hybrid, i.e. continuous in the outbreak probability and discontinuous in the prevalence, transitions observed according to the topology of the network [39,40,42,43,53\u201355]. Here we found rich dynamics as the impact of stochastic effects. These effects were less important when the difference between strains\u2019 epidemiological traits was small. Conversely, for a higher difference in cooperative factor, different outcomes are equally probable. Results presented here are preliminary and limited to two network configurations. Future work should investigate additional network topologies, e.g. a power-law degree distribution, and further values of the network parameters. In addition, more sophisticated numerical analysis (e.g. scaling analysis) would be needed to better classify the nature of the phase transitions.",

            "text": "Concurrence of inter-species cooperation and intra-species competition is present in many epidemiological situations. Currently, around 90 distinct Str. pneumoniae serotypes are known to co-circulate worldwide, despite indirect competition mediated by host immune response [4]. The emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains and the development of vaccines able to target only a subset of strains has motivated extensive research on the drivers of Str. pneumoniae ecology [4,5,20]. Strain circulation is facilitated by respiratory infections, e.g. influenza [56,57] and some bacterial infections [11,12]. Cooperative behaviour has also been observed between HIV and infections such as HPV, tuberculosis and malaria [1,9,10,58,59]. This increases the burden of these pathogens and causes public health concern. At the same time, there is evidence that different strains of tuberculosis [2,60], malaria [3] and HPV [61\u201363] may compete. In particular, multidrug-resistant strains of tuberculosis (MDR-TB) are widely spread, although the acquisition of resistance seems to be associated with a fitness cost [59,64]. The synergistic interaction with HIV could play a role in this emergence and surveillance data suggest a possible convergence between HIV and MDR-TB epidemics in several countries [59]. Our theoretical work highlights ecological mechanisms potentially relevant to these examples. In this regard, an essential aspect of our model is the trade-off between transmissibility and cooperativity in determining strain advantage. Although differences in transmissibility across strains have been documented, e.g. fitness cost of resistance [65], gathering information on strain-specific cooperative advantage remains difficult. The theoretical results illustrated here show the importance of quantifying this component for better describing pathogen ecosystems.",

Patterns of competitive and cooperative interactions could be at play, for instance, among recently emerged pathogens such as Zika virus [66]. Zika virus has emerged in regions where Dengue and Chikungunya viruses are endemic. Observed patterns of sequential monodominance by one arbovirus at a time at a given location suggest competition between these pathogens [67]. Also, considerable effort is currently devoted to characterizing possible positive interactions between Zika virus and HIV [66]. In some cases, different strains of the same pathogen can interact both competitively and cooperatively, as in the case of Dengue [8,14]. Primary Dengue infections are characterized by mild symptoms and grant short-term cross-protection against other serotypes. As cross-immunity wanes over time, however, secondary Dengue infections not only become possible but are also associated with severe illness and with increased virulence.",

We decided here to consider two SIS pathogens and the results cannot be readily extended to other models, because the dynamics of disease unfolding alters the outcome of strain interactions. It is important to note, however, that several dynamical properties of competitive and cooperative interactions, such as dominance vs. coexistence [27] and abrupt transitions [68\u201370], hold for both SIS and SIR.",

All pathogens are assumed to have the same recovery rate; moreover, cooperation acts in both directions and the same factors ci quantify the enhancement in susceptibility when A infection occurs before Bi infection and vice versa. These assumptions may not hold for many synergistic pathogens, especially when cooperative benefits are based on different biological mechanisms. For instance, while HIV increases susceptibility against P. falciparum, the latter increases HIV\u2019s viral load, thus increasing HIV\u2019s virulence rather than host susceptibility to HIV [10,58]. It is likely that, by relaxing these assumptions, our model could exhibit even more complex phase diagrams. Eventually, other aspects of the disease-specific mechanisms and multi-pathogen interactions could affect the results presented here and should be addressed in future works. These include latent infections, which are characteristic, for instance, of tuberculosis [2], partial mutual exclusion among strains [2,6,15,16] or interaction mechanisms other than the ones introduced here (e.g. affecting the infectious period [24]).",

We found that a less transmissible and more cooperative strain may dominate; however, the conditions on the parameters for this to happen are non-trivial (non-monotonic) and the outcome critically depends on initial conditions and stochastic effects. When coupled with population structure, the presence of a cooperative pathogen may create the conditions for multi-strain coexistence by dynamically breaking the spatial symmetry and creating ecological niches. These results provide novel ecological insights and suggest mechanisms that may potentially affect the dynamics of interacting epidemics that are of public health concern.",
