Understand the critical aspects of transmission dynamics in a different age, sex, and clusters with various activities. Methods. We conducted a retrospective observational study with 3,127 confirmed cases' contact tracing data from the Center for Disease and Prevention (CDC) of South Korea. We investigated network property concerning infected persons' demographics and different infection clusters. Findings. Overall, women had higher centrality scores than men after week four, when the confirmed cases rapidly increased. Older adults have higher centrality than young/middle-aged adults after week 9. In the infection clusters, young/middle-aged adults' infection clusters (such as religious gatherings and gym facilities) have higher average path lengths and diameter than older adult's nursing home infection clusters. Interpretation. Some women had higher reproduction numbers and bridged successive transmission than men when the confirmed cases rapidly increased. Similarly, some older adults (who were not residents of nursing homes) had higher reproduction numbers and bridged successive transmission than young/middle-aged adults after the peak has passed. The young/middle-aged adults' religious gatherings and group workout have caused long successive transmissions. In contrast, the older adults' nursing homes were a small world where the transmissions within a few steps can reach out to many persons.",

These papers have provided an evolving epidemiology and transmission dynamics via estimated reproduction number. However, most of them have focused on the entire system in one location and there was no comparison between transmission dynamics of different clusters. Added value of this study: This study, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to compare the transmission dynamics of different cluster infections. We present the transmission dynamic with varying levels of granularity: entire country vs cluster infections as a longitudinal view. From the whole country-level analysis, we found that females have higher centrality (degree or betweenness) than males. From the cluster infection view, we found that young/middle-aged adults' infection clusters (such as religious gatherings and gym facilities) have higher average path lengths and diameter than older adult's nursing home infection clusters. Implications of all the available evidence: This study sheds light on different transmission dynamics concerning demographics (age and sex) and diverse behavior in cluster infections. These findings are essential for planning tailored policies to diverse communities. Our analysis code is publicly available to adapt to newly reported cases.",

(2) The contact tracing and testing allow us to investigate different transmission dynamics into various local communities. Person-to-person transmissions can be represented as a transmission network, and this network facilitates investigation of topological dynamics in disease transmission and detection of super-spreaders. (4, 5) Also, the transmission network can be divided into individual infection clusters that have different characteristics in terms of demographics and network topology. The network analysis has been widely studied in various infectious diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), (4, 5) Several Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS),(6)(6,7) tuberculosis, (8, 9) and cholera.(10) Some COVID-19 studies have revealed evolving person-to-person transmission dynamics in China in a longitudinal view. (11, 12) A genomic mutation study has investigated country-to-country transmission dynamics on a global scale. (13) A piece of critical missing knowledge is how person-to-person transmission differs across different demographics and also different super-spreading environments in cluster infections.",

Betweenness is the extent to which a node lies on the shortest paths between other nodes.(15) Nodes with high betweenness may have high control over transmission passing between nodes. We used betweenness to measure how much a patient contributed to the transmission as intermediate hosts. We defined a super-spreading person as a person with a degree > 3.5 for degree or top 5% betweenness values.(16) Note that the node degree was calculated based on all accumulated transmissions (whereas the reproduction number is generally calculated within the observation period). -Path length can measure how far the transmission chain of successive cases can go. The path length is the number of nodes or steps in the shortest path from a source node to a target node. The average path length is the average value of the shortest path lengths between all pairs of nodes in the network. The longest path length (also known as diameter) is the maximum amount of the shortest path length.",

We also presented the network property of the transmission network. The transmission network had a mean degree of 1.88 after aggregating all time windows. The system was getting sparse as new confirmed cases exponentially increased with unknown transmission paths (complete network visualization in Supplement 1). The centrality of individual patients. We further investigated the distribution of the network centrality concerning infected persons' sex and race (animated plot in Supplement 2). We computed the statistical significance on the difference of centrality distribution using the Mann-Whitney-U test.

The main observation includes: i) In early days until week four most confirmed positives were imported cases who were male in their 40s; ii) women were more than 50% of newly confirmed cases after week 4; iii) there were more female-to-female transmissions than male-to-male transmissions; iv) children and adolescents infected their parents; and v) older adults infected other older adults. Further investigation is needed to obtain statistical power. We expect these observations can provide situational awareness to future contact tracing efforts.",

The transmission network was getting sparse as the number of newly confirmed cases rapidly increased. The sparsity limitation was inherited from the contact tracing containing the increasing number of unknown transmission paths in local communities. Thus our estimate on network property (degree, betweenness, diameter, and path length) should be interpreted as a lower bound.",

A possible explanation might be that men are more likely to die or critically ill than women, and consequently men have less opportunity to shed the virus.

This observation may imply that the active behavior (e.g., physically close gatherings in church, active group workout in closed facilities) of young/middle-aged adults can spread further away to other communities. Thus, restricting trips to other cities would be an adequate policy to prevent the spread effectively.",

Among the three nursing homes, Cheongdo Daenam Hospital Psychiatric Ward had the highest fatality, 31.82%. This closed psychiatric ward has many long-term patients with underlying diseases.

The mean age of the imported patients was 42 years old at week two and consistently decreased to 35.6 years old until week 11. Men took more than 50% of the imported cases for all observation periods (from 71% to 59% at week two and week 11).",
