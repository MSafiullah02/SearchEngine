In humans there are 18 \u03b1 and 8 \u03b2 subunits which form 24 different heterodimers [reviewed by 1]. Large extracellular domains of integrins mediate interactions with extracellular ligands, while the cytoplasmic domains mediate communications with the cytoskeleton and signaling molecules [reviewed by 2]. Based on the crystal structure resolution of the av\u03b23 integrin extracellular domain, ligand recognition is mainly mediated by a cationic binding site on the \u03b2 subunit adjacent to the exposed \u03b1 subunit [3, 4]. In addition, half of the 18 \u03b1 subunits contain a 20 0-amino acid inserted (I) domain which contributes to ligand recognition and specificity [2, 5].",

            "text": "During the last decade, the role of integrins in interactions of various cells with their microenvironment has become a focus of intensive research. Recent studies on monocytes, neutrophils, platelets, fibroblasts, endothelial, and pulmonary as well as intestinal epithelial cells (EC) demonstrated integrin involvement in regulation of virtually all vital cellular functions, including cell survival, proliferation, differentiation, migration, and cytokine production [reviewed by 1, 6, 7]. Upon binding their extracellular ligands, integrins transmit outside-in signals that regulate various cellular functions. In addition, integrins are able to provide inside-out signaling regulating the affinity of integrin binding to its ligand, and such signaling can be induced by cellular activation with chemokines or cytokines. Hence, integrins act as bidirectional signaling molecules [1]. Several signaling pathways activated by integrin engagement were identified, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) pathways [8, 9]. Integrins are involved in focal adhesion complexes comprising over 20 signaling and adaptor proteins, regulating actin cytoskeleton rearrangement and cell motility [10]. Binding of an integrin receptor to its ligand results in largescale conformational changes such as separation of the cytoplasmic domains of the a and \u03b2 subunits which causes cytoskeletal rearrangements and activation of downstream signaling [11]. According to the current concept, integrins act as specific sensors for dynamic changes in the microenvironment that occur during tissue development, inflammation, and tumorigenesis, and modulate cellular responses to these changes [6, 7, 9].",

Congenital deficiency in \u03b22 integrins (i.e. the leukocyte adhesion deficiency) is characterized by recurrent, severe bacterial infections that are eventually fatal [12]. Recent studies have emphasized the importance of leukocyte integrins in the cross talk with immunoreceptors, including T cell receptor and Fc receptors, for immune responses [13]. However, the role of epithelial integrins in innate immune and inflammatory responses in mucosal tissues, such as pulmonary epithelium, remains poorly understood.",

Pulmonary EC express an array of innate immune receptors, such as Toll-like receptors (TLR), as well as cytokine, growth factor and histamine receptors, involved in the regulation of dynamic interactions of the epithelium with the environment. Integrin receptors are significantly represented in pulmonary epithelium. Eight different integrin heterodimers are expressed in airway EC, i.e. \u03b12\u03b21, \u03b13\u03b21, \u03b16\u03b24, \u03b19\u03b21, \u03b15\u03b21, \u03b1v\u03b25, \u03b1v\u03b26, \u03b1v\u03b28 [7]. These heterodimers recognize a range of ECM proteins: collagen I, tenascin C, laminins 5, 10, 11, osteopontin, fibronectin (Fn), vitronectin (Vn), and others [7]. It is known that lung epithelial integrins are critical for maintaining epithelial integrity, repair of damaged cells, and regulation of cell differentiation and proliferation [7, 15]. The expression of integrin receptors in the respiratory epithelium is tightly regulated, and rapid increase in \u03b15\u03b21 integrin level in response to injury has been demonstrated [16]. Accordingly, integrin receptor ligands such as Fn, Vn, tenascin C, and osteopontin are rapidly induced at sites of epithelial damage or injury [7].",

Lung epithelial integrins are known to provide co-stimulatory signals towards growth factor receptors, regulating cell survival and proliferation [reviewed by 7]. However, the co-stimulatory functions of pulmonary integrins appear to be wider and involve the cross talk with other receptors. We have recently found that \u03b21 integrins in human bronchial EC provide costimulatory signals that increase TNF-induced proinflammatory responses [17]. Interestingly, integrin-mediated responses in these cells involved activation of the nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) Syk recently discovered in the respiratory epithelium [17].",

This is an elegant example of a bacterial interference with the adhesion/invasion cell machinery during the later stages of infection, when it may be advantageous for the pathogen to seek out new infectious targets [42]. Although the molecular mechanisms of interactions between S. aureus \u03b1-toxin and integrin receptors remain undefined, a recent study suggests a possibility of a direct binding of the \u03b1-toxin to \u03b15\u03b21 integrin in lung EC [43]. Such interactions can be potentially involved in the pathogenesis of staphylococcal pneumonia as the \u03b1-toxin-induced death of EC was found to be partially mediated by \u03b15\u03b21 integrin [43].",

PTKs, which can be found in integrin-associated signaling complexes, are activated by the engagement of \u03b21 integrins and involved in S. aureus internalization [45]. More specifically, it is the signaling via the Src family of PTKs that is necessary, since Src inhibitors and certain Src-deficient cell lines show decreased S. aureus uptake [46, 47]. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is another PTK whose inhibition results in decreased S. aureus invasion, suggesting a role of FAK as a signaling intermediate between integrins and Src [48]. The serine-threonine protein kinase integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is attached to the actin cytoskeleton, and is also necessary for S. aureus uptake, emphasizing the importance of actin remodeling for the internalization of bacteria [49]. In addition, S. aureus binding to integrins via FnBP can activate actin remodeling that results in increased bacterial motility on the cell surface preceding the internalization [50]. Hence, binding of S. aureus to \u03b15\u03b21 integrin via FnBP activates signaling pathways that can mediate host responses to the pathogen.",

S. pyogenes can cause severe pneumonia, as well as wound infections, septicemia, and endocarditis [52]. It has been known since the 1980s that S. pyogenes is capable of binding Fn, and that the attachment to ECM proteins may be important in invasion of the epithelium [53, 54]. This is now understood to be due to numerous FnBPs present on the surface of S. pyogenes, particularly M1 protein and PrtF1/SfbI [55]. Cue et al. [56] found that S. pyogenes binding of Fn via M1 protein was critical for invasion of EC, and that this process was abrogated by antibodies to \u03b15\u03b21 integrin. Using integrin inhibitors, it was demonstrated that the invasion of EC by streptococci was mediated by formation of integrin \u03b15\u03b21-Fn-M1 protein complexes [57]. However, M1-/SfbI+ strains of S. pyogenes are also capable of invading EC in an integrin-mediated fashion suggesting the redundancy in the mechanisms of bacterial pathogenesis [58, 59]. More recent studies have demonstrated that blocking of ILK, a key molecule in integrin-mediated signaling, abolished S. pyogenes uptake [49]. Downstream of ILK, phosphorylation of the adaptor protein paxillin has been shown to be crucial in M1+ S. pyogenes internalization [60]. These findings provide clear evidence that S. pyogenes utilize integrins as receptors during EC invasion.",

Indeed, during infection of lung EC with S. pyogenes, gene transcription of \u03b15 integrin and Fn greatly increased and was followed by an increase in both \u03b15 integrin and Fn protein expression by EC [61]. Moreover, S. pyogenes are able to induce active transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21 production in human tonsil fibroblasts, and TGF-\u03b21 in turn upregulates the expression of both \u03b15 integrin and Fn [62]. As a result of an increased \u03b15\u03b21 integrin expression, a subsequent increase in streptococcal invasion occurred, this time in an FnBP-dependent manner [62]. The latter study also suggested that S. pyogenes-infected fibroblasts can represent chronic sources of TGF-\u03b21 in vivo, causing upregulation of integrins in the surrounding epithelium. Interestingly, there appears to be a reciprocal interaction between TGF-\u03b2 and integrin receptors, as \u03b1v\u03b26 integrin can bind TGF-\u03b2 latency-associated peptide and activate TGF-\u03b2 [63]. This study suggested that the complex interplay involving TGF-\u03b2 and integrin \u03b1v\u03b26 in lung EC initiated by microbial compounds is critical in lung innate immune defense [63].",

The bacterium is thus able to exploit integrins using a positive feedback loop, resulting in increased survival and persistence at the site of infection. In addition, B. pertussis produces a repeat in toxin (RTX) adenylate cyclase toxin called CyaA, which further exploits \u03b1M\u03b22 integrins in macrophages by binding them and subsequently converting cellular ATP to cAMP, suppressing the bactericidal activities of these cells [reviewed by 85]. Recent studies demonstrated that via interaction with \u03b1M\u03b22 integrins, the adenylate cyclase toxin also induces cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) in macrophages. The latter protein can then significantly contribute to the inflammatory responses caused by B. pertussis [86].",

The major virulence factor of H. influenzae is the polysaccharide capsule. Encapsulated strains of H. influenzae are designated as types a, b, c, d, e, and f according to their capsular antigens, type b being the most important clinically and causing severe invasive diseases, i.e. meningitis, epiglottitis, and septicemia. H. influenzae that lack capsular polysaccharides are referred to as nontypeable and are less virulent. Many clinical isolates of nontypeable H. influenzae are able to bind ECM proteins [90]. For example Hap, an ubiquitous nonpilus adhesin of H. influenzae, specifically binds to Fn, laminin and collagen IV, and such interactions mediate bacterial adhesion to the ECM [91]. These data suggest that H. influenzae can indirectly bind integrin receptors representing the natural ligands for these ECM proteins in the respiratory epithelium, i.e. \u03b15\u03b21, \u03b13\u03b21, \u03b1v\u03b26 [7]. However, integrin involvement in adherence of H. influenzae to the respiratory epithelium has not been directly explored. Nevertheless, the uptake of nontypeable H. influenzae by M cells in the intestinal epithelium was mediated by \u03b15\u03b21 integrin along with TLR-4 and platelet-activating factor receptor, as demonstrated by the blocking of translocation of bacteria into M cells in the presence of specific receptor inhibitors [92].",

Such viruses directly bind to a variety of integrins present in the respiratory epithelium, e.g. \u03b12\u03b21, \u03b13\u03b21, \u03b15\u03b21, \u03b1v\u03b25, \u03b1v\u03b26, and use them as receptors to attach to the cells and enter them.

Several viruses, e.g. Coxsackieviruses, foot-and-mouth disease viruses, human parechoviruses, and echoviruses possess a functional RGD motif in one of their capsid proteins that allow viruses to bind integrins, i.e. \u03b1v\u03b23 or \u03b1v\u03b26 [101].

Among the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), TLRs are key molecules that sense the invasion of pathogens based on their typical molecular structures, such as LPS, peptidoglycans, flagella, single-stranded or double-stranded RNA, CpG DNA, etc. [103]. Such structures are unique to microorganisms in contrast to metazoans, and therefore allow for discrimination between self and nonself that is essential for immune defense [103]. Upon their activation, TLRs induce signal transduction leading to inflammatory responses and eventually to elimination of the invader. However, microorganisms are capable of binding various receptors of host cells resulting in complex cellular responses. It has now been recognized that there exists a huge diversity in innate immune receptors, in addition to the best-studied TLRs. The importance of non-TLR PRRs, such as Nod-like receptors, C-type lectins, scavenger receptors, or protease-activated receptors, as integral components of innate immune recognition, has been recently discussed in several excellent reviews [104, 105, 106]. The role of integrins as PRRs is still unclear, although leukocyte integrins serving as complement receptors, e.g. Mac-1, are recognized as PRRs for certain pathogens [107]. The role of epithelial integrins in innate immunity is even less understood, despite the fact that these receptors are highly expressed in mucosal surfaces, such as airway EC.",

Like TLR, integrin receptors are germline-encoded and highly conserved in the evolution, present in all metazoans including invertebrates, e.g. ascidians, nematode worms and Drosophila [108]. As outlined above, integrins are able to bind a wide variety of microorganisms, including both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that integrin receptors are able to sense diverse pathogen-associated molecular structures, although many of the specific ligands involved in such pathogen-host interactions are still unknown. Interestingly, a variety of microorganisms, i.e. S. aureus, S. pyogenes, mycobacteria, S. pneumoniae, possess various Fn-binding proteins allowing interactions with integrin heterodimers using Fn as a molecular bridge. Remarkably, the subsequent cellular responses are different from those elicited by Fn alone. Some other pathogens bind directly to integrins, forgoing the use of ECM proteins. For example, Y. pseudotuberculosis invasin interacts directly with \u03b21 integrins, as does B. pertussis FHA [18, 81, 83]. Interestingly, FHA binds to integrins via an RGD domain like the interaction between integrin receptors and their natural ECM ligands (fig. 1).",

Indeed, internalized bacteria may be cleared due to inflammatory signaling initiated by intracellular Nod-like receptors and endosome-located TLRs, or as a result of apoptosis of infected cells. Furthermore, internalization may be critical in activation of adaptive immunity because infected cells, including mucosal EC, are able to present microbial antigens to lymphocytes [115, 116].

Although these studies did not investigate infectious processes, they demonstrated the feasibility of employing integrin inhibitors in vivo to suppress lung inflammation. Would it be possible to use integrin inhibitors to interfere with bacteria-host interactions to alleviate potentially detrimental integrin-mediated cellular responses? Although more studies into the mechanisms of pathogen-integrin interactions are required before this question can be answered, the inhibition of integrins may represent a promising new tool to combat pulmonary infections.",
