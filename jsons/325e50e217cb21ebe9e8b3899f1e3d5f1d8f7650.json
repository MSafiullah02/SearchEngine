Limitation for leucine, which is encoded precisely at the frameshift site, dramatically increased the frequency of leftward frameshifting. Limitation for phenylaianine or arginine, which are encoded just before and just after the frameshift, did not significantly affect frameshifting. Protein sequence analysis demonstrated the occurrence of two closeiy related frameshift mechanisms. In the first, ribosomes appear to bind leucyl-tRNA at the frameshift site and then slip leftward. This is the 'simultaneous siippage' mechanism. In the second, ribosomes appear to slip beiore binding aminoacyl-tRNA, and then bind phenylaianyl-tRNA, which is encoded in the left-shifted reading frame. This mechanism is identicai to the 'overlapping reading' we have demonstrated at other bacterial frameshift sites. The HIV-1 sequence is prone to frameshifting by both mechanisms in E. coH.",

Our purpose was to discover whether the ribosomal frameshifting directed by a very short sequence in HiV-1 could be reproduced by E coli ribosomes in vivo, and, if so, whether we could alter the rate of frameshifting by regimens that change the relative abundance of key aminoacyl tRNAs encoded at or near the frameshift site. Weiss etal. (1989) have also reported that a 52 nucleotide fragment from HIV-1 is sufficient to direct ribosomal frameshifting in an E. coli system. In this report we present evidence that a much shorter 15-17 nucleotide sequence derived from HIV-1 is sufficient to direct the same ribosomal frameshift event in E. coli as in eukaryotes. We also show that in E. coli the rate of ribosomal frameshifting on that sequence can be increased by limitation for leucine, the amino acid encoded at the frameshift site. Protein sequence analysis of the product indicates the occurrence of two siightiy different mechanisms of shifting.",

Asn-Phe-Leu-Arg (Jacks et al., 1988b) , where Leu is encoded by positions 5-7 and Arg is encoded by positions 7-9.

Figure 1 shows the sequence of the translated strand from the region of our constructs that reproduces the gag-pol frameshift signal from HIV-1. The /acZ frameshift alieles carried on plasmids pi^iV13 and pHIV201 are constructed so that a shift to the left by one base, as in the expression of the gag-po/fusion of HIV, is required to generate active enzyme. The two constructs both carry a short sequence identical to the region around the frameshift site in the gag-po/overlap of HiV-1 for 15 nucleotides in pHIV13 and 17 nucleotides in pHIV201 (see Fig. 1 ); they differ slightly from one another severai bases downstream of the frameshift site. Host ceils carrying either of these piasmids produce active enzyme at about 1% of the efficiency of cells carrying a control lacZ* plasmid (Table 1) . This basal value is close to the value (1.8%) observed by Weiss et al. (1989) for frameshifting on a much longer HIV-derived sequence in a similar p-galactosidase reporter. It is also much higher than the frequency of leftward frameshifting (0.03-0.2%) we observed previously at sequences unrelated to HIV (Gailant and Lindsiey, 1992) . The presence of the HIV sequence in our reporter thus leads to an unusually high frequency of leftward frameshifting.",

The figure presents the sum of three independent sequencing runs, one performed at Illinois and two at Riverside. In every cyle, the most abundant PTHamino acid released predominates over others by at least a factor of two, affording a clear signal of the primary sequence. Secondary signals reflect a variety of artefacts. One is minor peaks which anticipate the next cycle (for example, F in cycle 8, R in cycle 10, E in cycle 11, and G in cycle 12}, presumably owing to a minority of the protein that is one amino acid shorter on the /V-terminus than the bulk of the material.

As an additional control, therefore, we tested 201-U7, a construct that is identicai to 201 except for the conversion of the leucine UUA codon to UUU (see Fig. 1 ). In this construct, ieucine limitation did not stimulate enzyme synthesis as in 201, but ratfier reduced it, as it did in the wiid type (Table 4) . The reduction was a good deal less than in the wiid type, suggesting that some frameshifting at various positions still occurs in 201-U7, so as to offset partly the effect of reduced lacZ expression. However, the difference between tine response of 201 and that of 201-U7 demonstrates that the leucine codon eliminated in the latter must be a major determinant of frameshifting induced by leucine limitation.",

The entries show growth rates and differential rates of enzyme synthesis relative to the control leucine culture, expressed as mean values i^ standard error (number replicate experiments). The mean control differential rates in these experiments were 2.3 \u00b1 0.16 (6} for pHIV201 and 191 \u00b1 44 (4) forpBWIIOO. Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 . In order to normalize to the same number of picamoles, all the values for the leucine-starved protein were multiplied by the ratio (unstarved/ starved) of the sums of the predominant peaks (N in cycle 8, F in 9, R in 11, and E in 12). The ratios of leucine to phenylaianine in cycle 10 of the two sets of data were as follows. For the unstarved case, the ratios in three runs were 2.55, 1.9, and 3.5, yielding an average of 2,65 with a standard error of 0.46. For the ieucine-starved case, the ratios in four runs were 0.52, 0.58, 0.68, and 0.51, yielding an average of 0.57 with a standard error ot 0.039. The difference is highly significant (P less than 0.005) by the la test (Crow et ai.. 1969) . The nucleotide sequence in the region of interest is shown below the cycle bar plot, with the expected amino acids read in the initial (0) reading frame shown above the nucleotide sequence, and the expected amino acids read in the leftward reading frame shown below. Solid bars = HIV-201 unstarved (+Leu); open bars = HIV--201 stan/ed (+LME) normalized to unstarved values. Fig. 3 . The protein sequence Is very similar to that of the protein from unstarved cells (Fig. 2) , with one significant exception. For the first nine cycles, the initial T-M-i-T-P-S-S-N-F sequence of the noimal (0) reading frame is clear, as It was in the protein from unstarved ceils. From cycle 11 onwards the signature of the leftward reading frame, R-E-G-i-P-G, is equaily clear. The one difference between the starved and unstarved proteins is at cycle 10, the position of the leucine codon. The predominant amino acid in the starved protein is F (phenyialanine) rather than L at this position.",

First, the data in every cycle have been corrected for carryover by means of the Applied Biosystems lagcorrection aigorithm (Huni^apiller, 1986) . The effectiveness (3) Exponential cells carrying plasmid pHIV201-U7 were treated as in Table 3 . The mean control differential rate was 4.7 \u00b1 0.20 (3). of this correction can be seen in the very low levels of carryover throughout the cycle bar plots of Figs 2 and 3, and of our earlier publications (Peter et ai, 1992; Gallant and Lindsiey, 1992) . Second, amino acids differ in their susceptibility to carryover from one cycle to the next (proline, for example, being notoriously bad), and it is carryover of F that we need to assess in considering these data. In fact. Figs 6 and 7 of Gallant and Lindsiey (1992) present exactly the needed controi: F was the amino acid present in cycle 7 of both sequences, and cycle 8 corresponded to a 'hungry' codon, just as in the present case. In those two sets of data, which represent the average of four independent sequencing runs in each case, carryover of F from cycle 7 to the next cycle averaged 8.3% (standard error = 2.8%), far less than the relative ievel of F found in cycle 10 of the present cycle bar plots.",

Beta-galactosidase activity was measured by incubating up to 50 MI of extract with 250 iil ONPG (0.8mgml ' in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer. pH 7.0) at room temperature, and monitoring the accumulation of o-nitrophenol at A420 using a continuously recording Gilford 2400-2 spectrophotomer. One enzyme unit is defined as the amount of enzyme required to produce a change in absorbance of one per minute. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (1951) using egg albumin as a protein standard. Differential rates in enzyme units per mg of protein were computed for the period of Induction (approximately one doubling in 2mM IPTG, 2.5 mM cAMP) with or without growth limitation (as indicated).",
