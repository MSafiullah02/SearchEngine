Moreover, molecular and cellular studies have shown that APN is localized to the abluminal membrane of vessels, and more precisely at the level of astrocytic feet and pericytes which surround the microvessels (Barnes et al., 1994, Kunz et al., 1994). A dense labeling was also observed at the level of meninges in brain and spinal cord, which form a barrier protecting both organs. The occurrence of an aminopeptidase-like activity in rat meninges was already reported (Zajac et al., 1987) and confirmed by the specific APN labeling observed in the present study. Enzymatic activities at the levels of microvessels and meninges could represent a clearing system for regulatory peptides, and the presence of APN with other peptidases such as angiotensin converting enzyme and NEP (Zajac et al., 1987) seems to support this hypothesis. Moreover, these enzymes could prevent the access of potentially harmful peptides to the brain or spinal cord. The aminopeptidase activity found in microvessels may also have physiological functions. Thus, it has been shown that APN rapidly hydrolyzes a number of vasoactive peptides at physiological pH (Palmieri et al., 1985), and may play a role in modulating their levels in the circulation and/or within the wall of the blood vessel. For instance, endogenous opioid peptides enkephalins are present in the human plasma (Pert et al., 1976) where they are probably degraded by both endothelial NEP (Soleilhac et al., 1996) and APN (review in Roques et al., 1993). Moreover, in the microvessels APN may play an important role in immune functions, as opioid receptors are localized on immune cells (review in Bhargava, 1990, Sharp et al., 1998).",

In the brain, APN has been found to be involved in the degradation of neuropeptides, particularly the endogenous opioid peptides, enkephalins (Waksman et al., 1985) in association with NEP, another zinc metallopeptidase (review in Roques et al., 1993). A moderate APN concentration was observed in the caudate\u2013putamen where a dense labeling of NEP was shown to be present (Waksman et al., 1986). Thus, the distribution of both enzymes and enkephalin peptides (Mansour and Watson, 1993) occurred in this structure. This co-localization of APN, NEP and enkephalins is in agreement with the well-admitted interruption of the messages conveyed by these peptides (Daug\u00e9 et al., 1996, review in Roques et al., 1993, Waksman et al., 1985). In addition to enkephalin fibers, the caudate\u2013putamen of the rat contains scattered dynorphin-positive fibers, another opioid peptide degraded by APN (Safavi and Hersh, 1995), which may thus play a role in the regulatory mechanisms controlling the activity of this neuropeptide.",

Unilateral lesions of the inferior colliculus produced sound localization deficits (Jenkins and Masterton, 1982). The presence of APN in this region has not been associated until now with any functional effect. Nevertheless, NEP and enkephalins have previously been visualized in this brain area (review in Roques et al., 1993). Co-localization of these peptides and their metabolizing enzymes, NEP and APN, suggests that enkephalins could have several roles, in addition to nociception, such as the regulation of auditory functions. Thus, APN has been shown to be involved in the metabolism of a heptadecapeptide, nociceptin (Montiel et al., 1997, Noble and Roques, 1997), which is abundant in the inferior colliculus (Houtani et al., 1996), where this peptide was reported to participate in the control of the auditory system. Accordingly, Nishi et al. (1997) have found defects in hearing recovery in mice lacking the nociceptin receptor and submitted to intense sound.",

The very high concentration of APN in both the pituitary gland and PVN suggests that this peptidase may have an important role in the HPA axis regulation. APN may regulate the endogenous enkephalins levels in these brain areas which exert a negative control on the HPA axis. Thus, it has been shown that blockade of opioidergic inhibitory input to corticotropin-releasing hormone-containing neurons of the PVN by the opioid antagonist, naloxone, induced an increase in plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol (Wand and Schumann, 1998). A functional deficiency of endogenous opioidergic inhibitory tone may be involved in depression, a disease marked by hyperactivity of the HPA axis (reviews in Arborelius et al., 1999, Kathol et al., 1989), or in the pathophysiology of drug addiction (Culpepper-Morgan and Kreek, 1997, Gonzalvez et al., 1991, Schluger et al., 1998).",

APN is anchored to the microvillar membrane via an uncleaved signal for membrane insertion. The physiological function of APN at this level could be to participate in the final steps of digestion, by cleaving peptides into their constituent amino acids. Moreover, the tonic participation of endogenous enkephalins at different levels of the gastrointestinal tract has been demonstrated using NEP inhibitor (reviews in Checler, 1991, Roques et al., 1993). Thus, a naloxone-antagonized antidiarrheal effect of the NEP inhibitor thiorphan has been reported (Mar\u00e7ais-Collado et al., 1987). It is due to the antisecretory action resulting from the stimulation of peripheral delta opioid receptors by the endogenous enkephalins tonically released from the submucosal plexus neurons (Kachur et al., 1980). Given these results and because both NEP and APN are present in the gastrointestinal tract, it would be interesting to test the effects of orally administered mixed inhibitor (Roques et al., 1993).",

For instance, the present study demonstrates the co-localization of APN, NEP, enkephalins and opioid receptors in several regions, a result which was expected from numerous studies carried out with dual inhibitors, but not demonstrated until now. Nevertheless, APN, which preferably removes NH2-terminal neutral amino acids from peptides, has certainly other biologically active peptides as substrates. However, the possible physiological relevance of the degradation of these peptides, which remain to be characterized in vivo, is critically dependent on the extent of their tonic release. This might be investigated through appropriate behavioral experiments, provided that the receptor(s) of the peptide substrate should be characterized and the responses blocked by selective antagonists, as shown in the case of opioid system. Moreover, despite the relative broad specificities of APN, an in vivo selectivity is certainly achieved by the presence of the enzyme in brain areas where both the peptide and its receptors are co-localized.",

This radioiodinated compound could also be used to study the in vivo distribution of APN in various parts of the body after systemic administration, as already shown for NEP (Sales et al., 1991). Finally, the possibility to follow directly by competition the bioavailability of selective or dual NEP/APN inhibitors administered by different routes as already shown in the case of NEP and angiotensin converting enzyme (Fourni\u00e9-Zaluski et al., 1994, Jackson et al., 1986) is important considering the potential clinical application of these molecules (review in Roques et al., 1993).",
