            "text": "Influenza is a common seasonal viral infection that affects large numbers of people annually, with the highest mortality seen in the elderly. In April 2009 health authorities in Mexico reported increased numbers of people admitted to their hospitals with severe respiratory failure following an influenza-like illness. Many of these people were young. Furthermore, an increased mortality rate was observed. A novel strain of influenza A was identified and subtyped as H1N1 2009 (H1N1). The virus spread rapidly around the world from Mexico, made possible by the large volume of air travel. In March\u2013April approximately 2.35 million passengers departed from Mexico to travel to more than 1000 cities in 164 countries around the world (Khan et al., 2009). By June 2009, the World Heath Organisation (World Health Organisation, 2009) upgraded the epidemic to pandemic status due to the rapid spread and lack of immunity in the global population. The 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus was genetically mapped as an avian strain that crossed from the host carrier pigs into humans (Gatherer, 2009). The viral antigenicity and the high level of person-to-person transmission combined to create the optimal setting for the pandemic. Because influenza is triggered during winter months by cooler temperatures, increased cloud cover and rainfall, countries in the Southern Hemisphere entering their winter season had to rapidly prepare for an increased number of people with severe respiratory failure related to H1N1.",

The H1N1 virus was confirmed by means of a polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) assay. Initially testing was challenging as the standard test, PCR, used for throat and nose swabs, had a reduced sensitivity to detect the virus in patients with severe respiratory disease. Detection improved by testing sputum and bronchial lavage specimens using nucleic acid detection tests. Recent influenza A infection was also confirmed by the presence of high antibody titres in respiratory serology tests.

            "text": "As the severity of the level of respiratory failure became apparent, several modes of therapy were considered including ECMO (Box 1\n) and airway pressure release ventilation\u2013APRV (Box 2\n) (Downs and Stock, 1987, Stock et al., 1987). Seven patients were externally referred for ECMO. One pregnant woman had refractory hypoxia and a PaO2 of 49 mm Hg (6.5 kPa). Initially she was managed on APRV with inspired oxygen concentration of 100%, Pressure High (Continuous Positive Airway pressure [CPAP] high) 28 cm H2O and Pressure Low (CPAP low) of zero. The patient was placed on a Pressure low of zero as this allowed the patient to expire without any impedance to expiratory flow (the patient's breathing) from the ventilator and therefore facilitated CO2 excretion. Her inspiratory time was set at 4 seconds and her expiratory time 0.6 seconds which gave her a frequency of 12 breaths per minute, preventing complete alveolar collapse. The intrinsic positive end expiratory pressure (Auto PEEP) of 10 cm H2O was set at an alveolar level and therefore it did not impede expiration. When PEEP is set on the ventilator, it impedes the expiratory gas flow from the patient and consequently the CO2 clearance. By removing the ventilator-set PEEP, there is no impedance to the gas flow from the patient and enables CO2 clearance. In APRV, the setting for time low is short. This deliberately causes air trapping that results in intrinsic PEEP equivalent to the amount generated by the ventilator but this is at alveolar level (in the lungs) and not at ventilator level. The intrinsic PEEP does not cause impedance to gas flow from the patient. Provided acceptable pH, PaCO2 and lactate levels were maintained by the patient, a PaO2 of 50\u201360 mm Hg (6.7\u20138.0 kPa) was accepted. Utilising this mode of ventilation the patient avoided ECMO and made a full recovery with a viable pregnancy.Box 1Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO)Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) is an historical name for extracorporeal life support (ECLS) that uses cardiopulmonary bypass technology to provide gas exchange in patients with severe, potentially reversible acute respiratory failure. An external artificial circulation carries deoxygenated blood from the patient to a gas exchange device (oxygenator) and blood becomes enriched with oxygen and carbon dioxide is removed. The blood then re-enters the patient's circulation. Circuit flow may be achieved using a pump (centrifugal or roller) or by the patient's arterio-venous pressure gradient (pumpless). There are two forms of ECMO\u2014veno-venous ECMO and veno-arterial ECMO. ECMO enables ventilator settings to be reduced to provide time for treatment and recovery to occur.Box 2Airway pressure release ventilation (APRV)Airway pressure release ventilation or APRV is a protective lung strategy that uses pressure-controlled mode of ventilation to maintain plateau pressures to no greater than 30 cm H2O. It has the advantage that the patient is able to spontaneously breathe during the time-high interval, which limits the adverse effects of ventilation (e.g. haemodynamic instability) and potentially redirects ventilation to the more perfused area of the lungs (primarily from diaphragmatic plate movement). This mode of ventilation also has the advantage of slow lung recruitment over 12 hours enabling the FiO2 to be titrated down to a safer level. Time-low is kept at a relatively short period of time (0.6 seconds) to prevent de-recruitment of the lung at end exhalation and is manipulated to provide the required PEEP (positive end expiratory pressure) for the patient.",

It enabled the patient to breathe spontaneously during the \u2018time-high\u2019 interval, which limits the adverse effects of ventilation (e.g. haemodynamic instability) and potentially redirects ventilation to better perfused areas of the lung base.

Seven patients received APRV and three of these also received nitric oxide as rescue therapy, two of who died in ICU. A further example of this ventilatory approach is contained in Box 3\n.Box 3Example of the ventilatory approach using airway pressure release ventilation (APRV)A teenager presented with a flu-like illness and was ventilated on APRV with an upper pressure limit of 26 cm H2O, PEEP of 7.5 cm H2O and FiO2 of 0.8. Her PaO2 was 70 mm Hg (9.3 kPa) with an oxygen saturation of 94%. She was positioned right side up and commenced on Tamiflu on arrival. Her haemodynamic instability required vasopressor support to maintain her mean arterial pressure greater than 65 mm Hg. Her urine output was 50 mL per hour. Oxygen saturation was maintained at 95% but her PaO2 was only 68 mm Hg (9.1 kPa). When attempting to lower her FiO2 and upper pressure limit, her PaO2 decreased to 48 mm Hg (6.4 kPa) and her FiO2 was increased to 0.8. She was ventilated on APRV for 3 days and weaned to pressure support ventilation (PSV) on day 4. However, after 8 hours on PSV she deteriorated, with PaCO2 retention. She was put back onto APRV and her PaCO2 was maintained at around 50 mm Hg (6.7 kPa). The next day she was put onto PSV, but failed to wean and her APRV was recommenced for a further two days. She was weaned to PSV on day 8 but again failed after 16 hours and went back to APRV at similar levels to prior to PSV. She received a tracheostomy at this time. On day 10 she was trialled on PSV and over the next 3 days she was weaned to be successfully decannulated on day 13.",

The extra workload lasted for several weeks, consistent with reports from other centres in Australia and New Zealand (ANZIC Influenza Investigators, 2009).

Preparedness for a pandemic by the Australian Government (Horvath et al., 2006) included the manufacture of sufficient vaccine for the entire Australian population on confirmation of a pandemic, but several months were required before it was available. During this lag time, adherence to infection control practices, particularly aerosol precautions was vital. The ICU was proactive in implementing strict infection control measures early to protect patients and staff. Nevertheless there was significant confusion, inconsistency and concern about risks to staff and appropriate precautions in the early stages of the index admission. Patients were placed into isolation with full aerosol precautions although the criteria to remove these precautions were inconsistent. Antiviral therapy was also commenced as soon as possible which is crucial in reducing illness among patients with seasonal influenza (Harper et al., 2009).",
