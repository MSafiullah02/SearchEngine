Early detection and timely treatment are the keys to survival from arrhythmia. The electrocardiogram (ECG) plays a pivotal role in arrhythmia diagnosis since it captures heart rate, rhythm, and vital information regarding the electrical heart activities and related conditions. However, the manual interpretation of ECG recordings is time-consuming and error-prone, especially for the long-term ECG recording which is essential to capture the sporadically occurred arrhythmia [17]. Therefore, an automated method to assist clinicians in detecting arrhythmia heartbeats from ECG is highly demanded.",

As reported by the Association for Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) [2], heartbeats can be categorized into five super classes: Normal (N), Supraventricular (S) ectopic, Ventricular (V) ectopic, Fusion (F) and Unknown (Q). In particular, problematic arrhythmias are mostly found in S-type and V-type heartbeats [6]. Figure 1 shows several ECG samples of different heartbeat types. We can see that the V-type heartbeat exhibits a huge morphological difference against other heartbeats, while the normal and the S-type heartbeats are similar in shape. It is less likely to accurately identify S-type heartbeats from normal ones merely based on morphology. In clinical practice, special rhythm information between two heartbeats, known as the RR-interval, is needed to help identify S-type heartbeats because S-type heartbeats are premature and they normally have shorter previous-RR-intervals than normal heartbeats. However, the inter- and intra-patients variations existing in the heart rhythms still impose great challenges to detection tasks. Besides, the sporadic occurrence of S-type heartbeats can also be an issue that tends to bias an automated heartbeat classification method.\n",

However, pattern-based classification models often experience difficulties in achieving satisfactory performance on abnormal heartbeat detection, especially when S-type arrhythmia heartbeats are involved. Besides, the effectiveness of extracted features, the mutual-influences among features, and the compatibility between the feature distribution and the classifiers [5] are three major factors that lead to a solid upper-bound on model performance.",

In consideration of the sporadic occurrence of S-type heartbeats, which imposes a great challenge to DNN training, many DNN-based studies use synthetic heartbeats for model training and evaluation [1, 8, 9, 15, 16]. However, these efforts suffer from data leakage because, after augmentation, data is not partitioned patient-wise into training and test sets. So that beats from the same patient may appear in both training and test data. The deep learning algorithms may learn patient-specific characteristics during training and gain a nearly-perfect classification performance on test data. Additionally, the over-optimistic results obtained from data leakage have hided a potential limitation of these DNN models in which only the ECG segmented heartbeats are accepted as inputs. The inter-heartbeat rhythm information, like RR-intervals, is not well considered in these models. Without such information, a high misclassification rate is probably obtained on S-type heartbeats. The problem is still open.",

            "text": "Contributions: In this work, we propose a two-step deep neural network-based heartbeat classification framework. Due to the observed difficulty of detecting S-type heartbeats from N-type heartbeats, the proposed framework trains a deep dual-channel convolutional neural network (DDCNN) which accepts segmented heartbeats as input in the first step to classify V-type, F-type and Q-type heartbeats. At this stage, S-type and N-type heartbeats are not the targets, so they are put into one bundle to be studied in the next step. In the second step, a central-towards LSTM supportive model (CLSM) is specially designed to distinguish S-type heartbeats from N-type ones. The RR-intervals of a heartbeat and its neighbors are arranged in sequence form, serving as the input to CLSM. In particular, CLSM learns and extracts hidden temporal dependency between heartbeats by processing the input RR-interval sequence in central-towards directions. Instead of using raw individual RR-intervals, the abstractive, mutual-connected temporal information provides stronger and more stable support for identifying the problematic S-type heartbeats. Besides, as an improvement as well as a necessary driver for activating the CLSM, a rule-based data augmentation method is also proposed to supply high-quality synthetic samples for the under-represented S-type RR-interval sequences. To avoid data leakage, the benchmark dataset is split into training and test sets at patient level following the well-recognized inter-patient division paradigm proposed in [6]. The synthetic training samples are generated from the training set only.",

The network accepts segmented ECG heartbeats (modified limb lead II, sampled at 360 Hz) as input, and outputs a prediction of probabilities of the N&S-bundle, V, F and Q classes. DDCNN is designed as a dual-channel convolutional neural network, with the small filter channel Conv(8, 32) capturing subtle fluctuations and the larger filter channel Conv(64, 32) handling wave patterns in ECG heartbeats. Information from the two channels are added together before the pooling operation. The entire DDCNN contains 18 convolutional layers, a pooling layer, a concat layer, a dense layer, and a softmax output layer. Specifically, the concat layer is designed to concatenate rhythm information (RR-intervals) to assist heartbeat classification. Each convolution operation is followed by a batch normalization and a ReLU activation. Every three convolutional layers of each channel are packed into a residual block and bypassed by a shortcut connection. The stacked residual blocks design reduces the network degradation risk and accelerate the training process.\n",

The result confirms that, without considerations of heart rhythm, a DNN is less likely to identify S-type heartbeats. Zhang et al. [17] and Mariano et al. [10] achieve close recall rates of S-type heartbeats as our framework, but they sacrifice S-type heartbeats precision rates (36.0% and 41%, respectively) and normal heartbeats recall rates (88.9% and 78.0%, respectively). This implies that both these two works misclassify a large portion of normal heartbeats as S-type heartbeats. In clinical practice, the erroneous misclassification of normal heartbeats as disease heartbeats leads to unnecessary additional tests, unnecessary patient treatments, expensive costs, and risks for patients.",

The result is denoted as DDCNN Only (without Concat). It is clear that, without the proposed CLSM, both standalone DDCNNs can hardly detect S-type heartbeats. The DDCNN with the concat layer performs better on both S-type and V-type heartbeats than the DDCNN without the concat layer. The outcome indicates that RR-intervals help to identify problematic heartbeats, especially for S-type heartbeats, but the assistance of raw RR-intervals is limited because they are likely to be influenced by the intra- and inter-patients variations.

The default value for NeRan is 25. In our experiment, we try different NeRan values from 2 to 35. The results show a growing trend of CLSM performance with NeRan increasing from 2 to 16. CLSM stably maintains in its optimal performance when NeRan is greater than 20. This means an input previous-RR-interval sequence of approximately 35 s is the minimum requirement for CLSM to accurately capture useful information from heart rhythm.",

The framework consists of a deep dual-channel convolutional neural network (DDCNN) and a central-towards LSTM supportive model (CLSM). In step-1, DDCNN incorporates both temporal and frequent patterns to identify V, F and Q-type heartbeats. In step-2, CLSM distinguishes S-type heartbeats from normal ones by taking advantage of the central-towards LSTMs to learn and abstract hidden temporal information of each heartbeat. The experimental results obtained on three real-world databases show that the proposed framework has the potential to make a substantial clinical impact.",
