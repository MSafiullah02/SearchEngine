Even though the B-CSF barrier is more accessible than the BBB for many foreign invaders, the BBB has received more attention regarding CNS pathology. Nevertheless, there is a growing body of evidence showing that the B-CSF barrier plays a crucial role in the spread of inflammatory reactions from the periphery to the CNS and contributes to the pathogenesis and progression of various neurological disorders [4\u20137]. If the B-CSF barrier allows blood-borne pathogenic components to enter the CSF, they would contribute to neurotoxicity and neuronal dysfunction. On the other hand, reduction in the efflux of waste products (and the consequent presence of neurotoxic residues inside the brain), could interfere with neurotransmission, and lead to various disorders. The mechanism(s) by which a dysfunctioning B-CSF barrier contributes to pathogenesis is still poorly understood. Therefore, we aim to review recent knowledge of the changes and regulation of the B-CSF barrier in different diseases. A better understanding of the role played by the B-CSF barrier in CNS diseases can shed light on identifying therapeutic targets in neuropathology.",

Much literature has been produced pointing to the likelihood that indeed the CP may produce more than 50% of total CSF [17\u201323]. The remaining CSF is derived from the interstitial fluid of the brain which is produced by the BBB and the ependymal cells lining the ventricles [18, 24\u201326]. The total volume of CSF in humans is about 140 ml, and every day about 600 ml CSF is produced [27].",

Based on experimental findings, it seems that AQP1 contributes to the production of 20\u201325% of the CSF [42]. AQP4 is expressed in the cytoplasm but not in the apical or basolateral membrane of CP epithelial cells. Diffuse cytoplasmic distribution of AQP4 and AQP5 suggests their possible expression in the membranes of intracellular organelles. Evidence of AQP7 in the apical membrane of the CP cells suggests a possible cooperation of AQP7 with AQP1 in CSF secretion [38, 43\u201345]. It was also suggested that GLUT1 may increase the permeability of the basal membrane of CP epithelial cells to water [19, 38].",

They are crucial for the exchange of metabolites and xenobiotics between blood and CSF. These transporters mainly belong to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter and solute carrier (SLC) super-families [21]. Two main types of ATP-biding cassette (ABC) transporters are expressed in the CP; the multidrug resistance-related proteins (MRPs) and multidrug transporters P-glycoprotein (PgP) [53]. The MRPs are selectively expressed on the apical or basolateral side of the epithelial cells, and move metabolic waste products and harmful molecules out of the CNS. The MRP1 protein transporter contributes to the protection of the B-CSF barrier against heavy metal ions, toxins, and various xenobiotics [54\u201356]. On the other hand, PgP is localized on the apical side of CP epithelial cells, where if anything, might aid the entry of harmful molecules into the CSF as was described for Taxol and 99mTc-sestamibi [57, 58]. The CP PgPs are shown to have a different pumping function than those in the BBB [4, 59\u201364]. SLC transporters also play significant roles in the neuroprotective machinery of the B-CSF barrier. The organic cation transporter SLC29A4 removes serotonin, dopamine and histamine from the CSF, and thus may be involved in the termination of neurotransmitter signaling [21].",

The regulation of B-CSF barrier permeability and integrity is the fundamental role of apical tight junctions (TJs) of CP epithelial cells\u2014they are responsible for regulating paracellular diffusion of water-soluble molecules through this barrier [71, 72]. Moreover, TJs maintain electrical resistance across the epithelial layer of the CP [72, 73]. The TJs are composed of proteins associated with the inner and outer leaflets of the cell membrane [74], whereas occludin and claudins are the main transmembrane molecules mediating epithelial contact [75]. The first integral protein of TJ to be described in CP was occludin [76, 77]. There is evidence that occludin seals the TJs, as decreased occludin levels lead to disruption of TJ permeability [78]. The group of TJ proteins called claudins are divided into several subtypes and CP epithelial cells express claudin 1\u20136, 9\u201312, 19 and 22 [77, 79, 80]. They are integral proteins responsible for limiting the throughput of TJ [81, 82].",

The acute phase of the CP reaction leads to increased expression of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 1 h after LPS application while prostaglandin D2 synthase (LPTGDS) that mediates both pro- and anti-inflammatory actions was detected between 6 and 24 h after LPS administration [102]. The protein lipocalin 2 (LCN2) was found exclusively in CP epithelial cells, peaking after 12 h and returning to basal levels 72 h after LPS administration [103, 104]. LCN2 binds a negatively charged ferric siderophore and exerts a bacteriostatic effect by sequestering iron [105, 106]. It seems that limiting iron availability to microorganisms is an important strategy to prevent translocation of microorganisms into the CNS. This suggestion is supported by overexpression of iron-related genes like hepcidin (Hamp), ceruloplasmin, ferritin heavy chain 1 (Fth1), and other genes encoding for upstream regulators of Hamp expression like Stat3, Smad4, Tfr2, and IL-6 in the CP epithelial cells after LPS administration [107].",

Studies showed that systemic injection of LPS resulted in upregulation of TLR1, TLR3, TLR4, CD14, COX-2, I\u03baB\u03b1 in the CP cells which may lead to decreased expression of occludin [110\u2013116]. In addition, there is evidence that activation of NF-\u03baB upregulates matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) production and induces claudin-5 degradation leading to alteration of the B-CSF barrier [117]. The expression of both MMP-8 and MMP-9 is upregulated 4 h after LPS application. Nevertheless, MMP-8 probably acts via collagen I cleavage, which affects the composition of the basal lamina of the CP and influences epithelial cell morphology and barrier integrity [118].",

Streptococcus suis infection induces disruption of epithelial integrity through the rearrangement of the TJ proteins occludin, ZO-1 and claudin-1. They then start to appear throughout the lateral membrane of the cells and within the cytoplasm of CP epithelial cells. These changes include shift of the perijunctional actin belt to the basal segment of the lateral membranes, flattening of cells, and \u201cbundles\u201d of actin stress fibers appearing in the basolateral cell compartment indicating restructuring of polarized F-actin. Occludin was not localized at the perijunctional actin belt, whereas a subset of actin fibers remained colocalized with ZO-1 [128]. In CP epithelial cells, the gene coding for claudin-2 was strongly down-regulated by Streptococcus suis. On the other hand, some genes in the CP epithelial cells were highly up-regulated including genes encoding adhesion molecules like ICAM-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), MMP-3, the NF-\u03bab and MAPK inflammatory cascades, inflammatory molecules like TNF\u03b1, IL1-\u00df, IL-6, IL-8 as well as the anti-inflammatory leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Moreover, infection by Streptococcus suis induces up-regulation of genes encoding proteins that participate in arginine-metabolism (ARG1, ARG2, NOS2). In addition, up-regulation of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase that contributes to antimicrobial defense in the CP by depleting tryptophan was observed [129\u2013131]. Moreover, Streptococcus suis induces cell death in CP epithelial cells by apoptosis and necrosis. Intensified cell death in the CP could lead to alteration in the B-CSF barrier function and facilitate penetration of bacteria and leukocytes into the CSF of the ventricular system reaching up to the brain parenchyma [132]. Another mechanism by which Streptococcus suis may enter the CSF involves invasion from the basolateral side of CP epithelial cells, transport within endocytic vacuoles to the apical side and exocytosis on the apical membrane. It has been shown that downregulation of PI3K effector molecules including the protein kinase Akt and members of the protein kinase C family participate in this transcellular migration of pathogens like Streptococcus suis [133].",

However, most CP vessels contained bacteria interacting with endothelial cells. The high level of tip-located adhesin proteins PilC1 and PilC2 of these bacteria implies a role in enhanced adhesiveness to the CP [149]. It was also found that Neisseria meningitidis can induce increased expression of IL-6, CCL20, CXCL1-3 and Nfkbiz (encoding the nuclear I\u03baB protein I\u03baB\u03b6), as well as granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte\u2013macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in CP epithelial cells.

In addition, microvascular endothelial cells may be another reservoir for the virus and may also facilitate virus entry across the B-CSF barrier [159].

It is known that degradation of blood components like heme, fibrinogen and intracellular structures creates damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that trigger inflammatory signaling cascades [178, 179]. One possible inflammatory reaction that is triggered by DAMPs is activation of TLRs that play a key role in the innate immune reaction [180, 181]. In a model of IVH, DAMPs led to activation of TLR4 in CP epithelial cells resulting in hypersecretion of CSF. It seems that this hypersecretion is dependent on TLR4/NF\u03baB signaling, activation of Ste20-related proline alanine-rich kinase (SPAK) and Na+/K+/2Cl\u2212 co-transporter 1 involved in CSF secretion [182]. It appears that upregulation of the transcription factor NF-\u03baB and chemoattractant molecules like CCL2, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF\u03b1, in CP epithelial cells support monocyte trafficking into the CP [183].",

            "text": "It has been found that subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) increases the number of macrophages in the epiplexus position of the CP, but the type of macrophages was not specified [184]. We described that SAH induces an immune reaction in the CP resulting in an increase in the number of M1 (ED1+ , CCR7+) and M2 (ED2+ , CD206+) macrophages as well as MHC-II+ antigen presenting cells in the epiplexus position. Moreover, we also found that increased intracranial pressure due to artificial CSF application induced both an immune reaction and increased proliferation of epiplexus cells in the CP. These findings indicate that increased intracranial pressure, and not just blood, contributes to cellular changes in the CP following SAH [185]. A recent study showed that SAH induces an increased number of ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 immunopositive (Iba-1+) cells and activated (CD68+) epiplexus cells [186]. Accumulation of immune cells in the CP after SAH or IVH triggers inflammation, alteration of TJ proteins and hypersecretion of CSF. This pathophysiological cascade may contribute to the development of post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus\u2014one of the main complications after hemorrhagic stroke [182, 187, 188]. It was believed that development of posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus is due to obstruction of CSF circulation, inhibition of CSF drainage in the arachnoid villi or meningeal fibrosis [189]. In contrast, other results suggest that CSF hypersecretion can also potentiate post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus after SAH or IVH. A possible mechanism may be via upregulation of Na+/K+/2Cl\u2212 co-transporter 1 in the cuboidal epithelial cells [190]. Hypersecretion of CSF may also be induced by stimulation of glossopharyngeal and vagus nerve endings that innervate the CP epithelium and arteries. An increase of cytoplasmic water vesicles in the acute phase of SAH is probably due to irritation of both nerves [191\u2013193]. Moreover, a recent study suggests that AQP1 may also contribute to hypersecretion of CSF and post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus. A significantly higher expression of AQP1 was found in the apical and basolateral membrane of CP epithelial cells from 1 to 14 days peaking at day 3 following the induction of SAH [194].",

Overall severity of ischemic insult is lower in the model of focal cerebral ischemia using middle cerebral artery occlusion as was proved by finding apoptotic cells characterized by nuclear DNA fragmentation only in the CP of the lateral ventricle in the ischemic hemisphere 6 h after middle cerebral artery occlusion [201]. MRI examination of B-CSF barrier integrity showed accumulation of contrast medium in the CP and the wall of the lateral ventricle on the ischemic side 6 h after middle cerebral artery occlusion. This was probably caused by apoptosis in the CP and leakage of contrast medium through the altered B-CSF barrier [207].

This is supported by decreased expression of AQP1 in CP epithelial cells up to 24 h, probably as a result of necrosis after global cerebral ischemia, but between 24 and 48 h the expression of AQP1 expression increased. This phenomenon could be explained by CP epithelial cell replenishment and restoration of the B-CSF barrier [209]. Interestingly, a more prolonged healing of the CP following global cerebral ischemia using the bilateral common carotid occlusion model was reported. These changes are related to CP endothelial cells that are detectable up to 7 days after the induction of global cerebral ischemia [210].",

This suggests that CP epithelial cells have also neural stem cell characteristics with the ability to express neuronal nuclear protein (NeuN) and glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) after mild to severe ischemia [215]. The mechanism by which the B-CSF barrier is stabilized is probably based on physical displacement of CP epithelial cells along the basal lamina. It was suggested that viable CP epithelium may \u201cfill in gaps\u201d caused by necrotic cells that undergo compression to render a full complement of cells covering each villus [206]. CP repair processes are probably accelerated by autocrine and paracrine mechanisms including expression of TGF\u03b21, BDNF and other growth factors [216]. Cytoplasmic fragments released from damaged epithelial cells following hypoxic exposure probably induces an immunological response with increased number of ED1+ macrophages, upregulation of C3 receptors and increased expression of MHC I and MHC II antigens. These pro-inflammatory changes are enhanced by overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), eNOS and iNOS, which promote the adhesion of leukocytes to vascular walls [217, 218]. It was proposed that CP plays a major role as the invasion route for T-cells into the ischemic brain following a stroke. The mechanism of migration is probably based on a potential chemokine gradient between the CP and the cortical ischemic lesion [219]. A similar mechanism was found in monocyte-derived macrophages that were increased in the CP and CSF during the first week after ischemic insult. Gene expression of adhesion molecules and chemokines like VCAM-1, MAdCAM-1, C3CL1, and Nt5e were transiently upregulated during the same time period [220].",

The initial phase, known as primary injury, involves mechanical damage acquired at the moment of trauma. The CP of rats exposed to a non-penetrative impact developed ultrastructural changes expressed as widening of the intercellular spaces between adjacent epithelial cells [225]. Such widened spaces are likely to be involved in enhanced transepithelial transport of materials and secretion into the CSF. A breakdown of the B-CSF barrier induced by TBI was confirmed by uptake of serum albumin by CP epithelial cells [226]. Furthermore, increased numbers of macrophages in the epiplexus position associated with widened spaces between the CP epithelial cells were found after non-penetrative injury [227]. This surplus of epiplexal cells is related to increased levels of cytokines and chemokines in the CP [228]. It was also found that TBI in humans is associated with elevated levels of cytokines and chemokines in microdialysis perfusates [229]. In addition, elevated levels of the chemokine CCL2 was detected in the CSF of patients. An experimental mice model of TBI confirmed increased levels of CCL2 in the CSF along with a better TBI outcome in CCL2 knock-out mice pointing to the deleterious effect of this chemokine [230]. Hemodynamic changes following primary injury induce secondary damage of the CP that is similar to ischemic stroke.",

The level of soluble megalin secreted from the CP epithelium decreases in CSF in AD patients suggesting a possible contribution to \u03b2-amyloid accumulation in brain tissue [239]. \u03b2-amyloid accumulation also occurs via increased expression of transporter proteins such as PgP and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 [11, 240\u2013243]. Transthyretin (TTR) secreted by the CP has been described as the major \u03b2-amyloid binding protein in CSF. It plays a significant role in the clearance of excess \u03b2-amyloid from CSF and can inhibit \u03b2-amyloid aggregation and toxicity. Decreased expression of TTR in CP epithelial cells has been found in AD mice [244]. However, the level of TTR in CSF of AD patients is in the normal range [245]. Apart from the altered levels of transport proteins, mitochondrial activity deficit, oxidative stress, and morphological/structural changes in the CP also contribute to the decreased efficacy of \u03b2-amyloid clearance in the CP [234, 246].",

Inflammatory cells migrate through the brain barriers towards the CNS. Specifically, the CP is a site for lymphocyte entry to the CSF followed by increased synthesis of specific IgG antibodies [260]. In the CP of MS patients, lymphocytes were present in both the vessels and stroma. The presence of T-cells, especially CD4+ T-cells, was shown to regulate immune cell trafficking across the B-CSF barrier via the production of IFN-\u03b3. Local IFN-\u03b3 signaling subsequently upregulates adhesion molecules such as VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 [71, 261\u2013264]. Reboldi et al. [265] suggested that the migration of T-17 cells through the CP could be regulated by the chemokine receptor CCR-6. Recently, it was found that the CP upregulates chemokines (CCL5 and CXCL9\u201311) and cell adhesion molecules involved in T cell migration upon peripheral immune stimuli [266].

Significant morphological differences were found between normal CP and CP papilloma, but not between CP papilloma and CP carcinoma. These changes include villous hypertrophy and diffuse enlargement of the CP with normal histological appearance [278]. Recently, it has been suggested that epigenetic alterations could be associated with specific CP tumor phenotypes. Hypermethylation in the promoter region of several genes like adenylate kinase, period circadian clock 2 (PER2), and phospholipid scramblase 4 (PLSCR4) leads to downregulation at the mRNA level that is typical for CP carcinoma. This epigenetic signature can distinguish aggressive forms of CP tumors from benign ones such as CP papilloma [279].",

The expression of AQP1 was found only in low-grade CP epithelial tumors, while high-grade CP carcinomas do not express this protein. This finding may be among the reasons why there are no described cases of hypersecretive hydrocephalus associated with high-grade CP tumors [280]. However, there is evidence for CSF overproduction and consequent hydrocephalus in low-grade CP tumors (especially papillomas) that can be explained by the enlarged CP surface [281, 282]. Interestingly, hydrocephalus was also described in CP neuroepithelial cysts. The authors suggest that increased numbers of water-filled vesicles in the CP can contribute to CSF overproduction and the consequent development of hydrocephalus [283].",

Twist-related protein 1 (TWIST1) is highly expressed in CP papillomas and involved in cell proliferation and invasion. This gene probably inhibits differentiation, interferes with the p53 tumor suppressor pathway and increases cell survival [284, 285]. The Myc proto-oncogene is a transcription factor, and its overexpression alone is sufficient to induce the development of CP carcinoma [286]. It has been found that overexpression of c-Myc in the CP epithelium leads to inflammation-dependent CP papillomas. The inflammatory infiltrate is composed of CD3+ T-lymphocytes (predominantly CD4+ T-helper cells) and CD68+ macrophages [287]. Expression of several markers like cytokeratin AE1/AE3, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, \u03b2-catenin and GFAP is indicative of primary CP tumors [288\u2013290]. Despite bearing the general characteristics of primary CP tumors, they can be mistaken for metastatic carcinoma in biopsy samples (Table 4; [291].",

We may conclude that the major changes are in the production of different proteins by CP epithelial cells, expression of TJ and transporter proteins as well as immune cell trafficking (summarized in the tables). However, it is questionable if the CP responds to different diseases in the same way in all ventricles. A comprehensive understanding of the role(s) played by the CP in different diseases would be the key that leads to new approaches to therapy. Currently, gene manipulation using viral vectors is on the rise and the CP would be a promising target for this sort of treatment.",

The importance of the CP is in forming the barrier between the blood and CSF to prevent the entry of harmful substances into the CNS. How this barrier functions, and in what way are the expression of TJ and transport proteins changed in different disorders still needs to be elucidated in detail. Nonetheless, it is clear that this barrier function can be used for treatment. Increased B-CSF barrier permeability would be useful for drug delivery, while on the other hand, closure of the barrier would be beneficial in preventing access to the CNS for pathogens or immune cells that can cause disease. Such barrier modulation can also be achieved using viral vectors. This underlines the absolute necessity for further studies in order to develop new therapeutic tools.",

The main site of the barrier (b) is at the level of the cuboidal epithelial cells that are linked by tight junctions (TJ), adherent junctions (AJ) and gap junctions (GJ). TJs are required for strong cell\u2013cell adhesion and include transmembrane (occludin, claudins and JAMs) and cytoplasmic proteins (ZO). AJs are formed by E-cadherin, a transmembrane protein that intracellularly binds to actin through a variety of protein complexes, including catenin (p120, \u03b2-catenin, \u03b1-catenin). GJ protein complexes comprising nectin also play a role in adherence",

Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae) can migrate through CP epithelial cells. Neisseria meningitidis (N. meningitidis) crosses the B-CSF barrier and forms colonies at the apical side of CP epithelial cells. Polyomavirus JC (JCV) probably forms a reservoir in CP epithelial cells. HIV has been described in endothelial and stromal cells as well as in epiplexus monocytes. Echovirus 30 (EV30) may invade and replicate in CP epithelial cells. Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) crosses the B-CSF barrier using myeloid cells as well as via a paracellular route through the TJs.
