The findings also imply that the inactivated vaccine candidate may enhance the cellular immune response, including the increased production of IFN-\u03b3 in monkeys. The production of INF-\u03b3 can increases the activity of natural killer (NK) cells and inhibits replication of the virus. As observed in a previous study, in SARS patients, the appearance of chest radiographs improved but the viral loads decreased while interleukins and other proinflammatory cyokines increased [19]. Whether or not a specific cellular immune response can be also induced by this inactivated vaccine need further investigation.",
