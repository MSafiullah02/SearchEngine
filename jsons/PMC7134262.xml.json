The digital transformation may be categorized into three dimensions: the use of new digital technologies; the change of organizational processes or the creation of new business models; and influencing all aspects of human life [4]. The digital transformation has changed the phenomenon of the digital divide from a situation of access to acquiring sufficient skills to use information and communication technology (ICT) effectively [5, 6]. Based on the latest OECD report [7], digitalization, ICT and technical skills development are seen as key components for human well-being and social development. Nevertheless, a gender gap in the access, use, and ownership of digital transformation is still present in G20 economies [7]. This gap is defined as the digital gender divide. Based on the findings of OECD, the digitalization and fighting the digital gender divide offers opportunities, enhances women empowerment and holds promises for enhanced productivity growth. The digital gender divide is well recognized at the work-life balance: Women and girls with poor digital literacy skills will struggle to find jobs as technology advances and this is an urgent global problem [8]. It is argued that girls are less confident in their maths, science and IT abilities, often due to or fueled by societal and parental biases, and parents\u2019 expectations about the future of their teenagers by leading girls\u2019 lower engagement in science and ICTs [9]. The effective promotion of women\u00b4s digital adoption from the government, from the private sector and the civil society is proposed as one solution [10]. However, this is not enough. Also educational elements in fighting against the digital gender divide are needed. It is essential to understand the work-life reflections to be able to develop education. This paper aims to research the perceptions and reflections on gender equality in the context of ICT.",

The percentage of female graduates has been slightly diminishing; from the 1980s 48%, 1990s 33%, after that stayed at that level for the next two decades - 34% for the 2000 and 36% for the 2010s [11]. Unfortunately, this finding supports the northern gender-equality paradox in STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) education: Based on that idea the more equal the society, the fewer women are doing the STEM education [12].",

Therefore, one purpose to carry out an alumni survey is to support the employability of graduates by improving the curriculum of the university according to the industry requirements. The latest alumni survey was carried out in the spring 2019 and it included equality related questions. In this case study, we are analyzing these alumni responses and proposals against in-equality. The research question of this study is: What are the alumni experiences and perceptions towards equality in work in the context of ICT? Furthermore, we are interested in what proposals alumni will give to change the situation in the ICT context.",
