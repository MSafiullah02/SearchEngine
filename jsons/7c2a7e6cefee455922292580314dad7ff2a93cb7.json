Regulating and certifying agencies mandate organizational plans for threat management to include risk factor identification, threat mitigation, prevention (when possible), response to, and recovery from the event. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that natural disasters kill approximately 90,000 people annually and affect an additional 160 million people worldwide (WHO, 2019; WHO, 2011) . The Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018 developed improvements to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) by establishing a clearer framework for disaster management in both the preparation for and response to each event; pre-staging now occurs with incident command centers, resource mobilization, and search/recovery teams on standby, ready to act (FEMA, 2018; Reynolds & Knox, 2019) . The Joint Commission continually updates their expectations for organizations, uses information obtained through their post disaster organizational debriefing, and supports organizations by providing informational resources (Joint Commission, 2018) . The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) provides a number of resources to assist organizations in the creation of their individual disaster management plans (OSHA, 2015) . In 2011, a policy directive was developed to deal with all natural and manmade disasters, which evolved into The Hartford Consensus that addresses the loss of life and has a chief principle that no one should die from uncontrolled bleeding (Jacobs, Burns, Pons, & Gestring, 2017) .

Regardless of the event type, radiology will be affected in some manner. While no amount of preplanning can fully prepare any organization for the unpredictability of a catastrophic event, having a plan in place will provide for better response and care during any mass casualty incident (MCI), regardless of the type of catastrophe. Many radiology departments are now creating their own disaster management plan within their department: while the hospital may have an organizational plan, individual departments should be aware of the role they will need to play when a catastrophe occurs (Dargan, 2018; Haygood, 2018) .",

The WHO describes an MCI as any event that results in a greater number of people seeking assistance and support than what a local system can provide (WHO 2007) . MCIs are usually a sudden and dramatic event that cause a surge in patients or a change in normal business. Whether an act of violence or a natural disaster, the healthcare community must have an action plan that can be immediately implemented to provide safety and recovery to all people affected. Healthcare personnel by nature, are dedicated to responding to any event they are faced with: it is this dedication that drives them to figure out a back-up plan when the original disaster plan doesn't or can't work.",

This is most successful when responding services have preplanned and carried out robust, ongoing training and practice drills. Partnerships must be formed and maintained between all agencies that may be involved. Ongoing monitoring of activity that may appear suspicious can pre-empt some attacks. It is difficult to smuggle bombs into a country or to transport them, so some terror groups are sending their bomb making recipes to home grown terrorists in locations where an attack is scheduled to occur, and the bomb can be crafted close to where the attack will occur. To help combat this, the New York City Metropolitan Transportation Authority's Security Awareness Campaign introduced \"if you see something, say something\" in 2002, as a method to be able to report suspicious behavior or packages. In 2010, the Department of Homeland Security expanded this to be a nationwide campaign. (DHS, n.d.) In 2016, a terrorist drove a truck into a crowd of people in Nice, France. 86 people died, 458 were injured, and 202 people received care at local hospitals. Challenges included being able to properly identify patients as many were unconscious or did not speak French. One hospital that normally performed 15 CT scans during an average night, performed 42 CT scans on 42 patients in 2 hours. (Dargan, 2018; Amoretti, 2018) Mass Shootings:",

Each department, including radiology, should have their own threat assessment conducted including a map of the department, location of staff, patients, and visitors. Staff should be inserviced on policies, procedures, methods of communication, and behaviors that can preserve lives during such an emergency.

(Reynolds, 2019) Each healthcare organization must have an individualized plan that is fitting of the facility, the size, the patient populations, layout, security (onsite and also municipal). In addition to the organization's plan, each imaging department should have their own disaster management plan that works in concert with the organization's overall plan. Investing large amounts of capital into resilient infrastructure can be difficult to justify when there are competing projects that need to be completed in the immediate future. Until an organization has endured great hardship and loss as the result of a catastrophe, investing money into a project that may never be needed, is often pushed to the side.
