These zoonotic viruses may cause diseases and infections in several animals, generally pigs and poultry. These zoonotic viruses in particular adapt very poorly to humans, so they seldom cause human diseases, which are limited to outbreaks circumscribed in terms of time and population. Nevertheless, human cases of A H5N1 were observed in Hong Kong for the first time in 1997 and have continued being reported to date. More than 700 cases have been notified, all in Asia and Northern Africa, with 413 deaths. Most cases are isolated, with some intrafamilial clusters being described. Human-to-human transmission is rare, which reflects the poor ability of the virus to adapt to human respiratory mucosa. The persistence of the circulation of these viruses and the great genetic variability of the influenza A virus make us fear that the avian virus may adapt to humans, which would ease its transmission among the human population, potentially causing a pandemic: this is what happened with the H1N1 influenza A, which had a porcine origin and adapted to humans, creating a pandemic in 2009. The first cases of human infection caused by H7N9 influenza A were reported in China during 2013, and most of these were related in one way or another to contact with poultry, whether direct or environmental in markets where live birds are commercialized. By 2015 there had been 488 confirmed H7N9 influenza cases in China since the beginning of the outbreak, with 185 deaths. This virus does not seem to spread easily among humans, and there has been no proof of sustained human transmission, although its transmission potential seems to be more effective than that of the H5N1 influenza A virus. A couple of cases have been reported outside China: a traveler in Malaysia who stayed in China and a man and his wife who were diagnosed in Canada in January 2015 after traveling to China (WHO).

These viruses can be found in the lower and upper respiratory tract of immunocompetent as well as immunocompromised patients. Their pathogenic role is not completely clear, because they usually occur at low frequency, have a low viral load, and are related to pathogens whose morbidity is better characterized. Diagnosis requires molecular techniques (real-time PCR), whose inclusion in future research will allow us to better characterize the epidemiology and clinical spectrum of the infections caused by these agents.",
