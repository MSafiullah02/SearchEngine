The older adult population is at high risk of negative outcomes from a COVID infection. In fact, the CDC estimates that 8 out of 10 deaths reported in the U.S. have been in adults 65 years old and older 1 . This makes the task of caring for this population on an inpatient psychiatry unit especially challenging. Inpatient psychiatry units are ambulatory units that are designed to promote recovery through socialization and milieu therapy, and thus, there exists an increased risk of person-toperson transmission. Mental healthcare workers find themselves questioning standard treatment protocols and face daily ethical and logistical challenges they have never faced before. The cases below describe specific challenges we have faced in delivering care.",

She was medically asymptomatic on assessment in the Emergency Department and on the admitting physical exam on the inpatient psychiatry unit. She screened negative for any mood or psychotic disorders, had longstanding insomnia and was cognitively intact. She declined to start medications for insomnia. On day 2 of admission, patient was noted to have a dry cough, denied any recent sick contact within the SNF, chills, shortness of breath, or phlegm production. She insisted that she felt \"well\" and initially declined to have her vitals taken. She was found to have capacity to refuse vitals, but her decision immediately raised an ethical dilemma for the team. We decided to start isolation precautions and defer vitals to ensure safety of staff. She later agreed to have her vitals taken, and they were found to be within normal limits. Droplet precautions were continued, nonetheless. Medicine was consulted: x-ray was not suggestive of airway disease, and a complete blood count showed chronic stable anemia and no leukopenia or leukocytosis. At this point, contact and droplet precautions were discontinued. Twelve hours later, the patient was found to have a temperature of 99.2F, which climbed rapidly to 100.7F within 3 hours. She was then transferred to medicine for COVID rule out and was confirmed to be COVID positive shortly after.",

He continued to struggle with mood lability, agitation, intermittent biting and scratching of staff. He also had longstanding pooling of saliva with spitting behaviors, that did not respond to any behavioral interventions (a cup, toweling) and was likely worsened by antipsychotics. After patient A was confirmed to be COVID positive, we became concerned that patient B was a carrier as he had been on the unit at the same time.

We considered intrabuccal atropine or intrabuccal ipratropium as treatments, but staff felt that they did not have sufficient access at the time to personal protective equipment (PPE) needed to administer these treatments.

Staff that is needed for direct patient care should be screened prior to entering the unit (sick contacts, exposure, symptoms, fever).

In our specific case, universal maskwearing had been implemented throughout the hospital prior to these events.

However, viral spread to and from nursing facilities and group homes is important for health systems to recognize and take steps to prevent. Patients and loved ones who live in these settings are among the highest risk for morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 due to advanced age or underlying medical conditions. As we saw at the King County, Washington long-term care facility in late February 2020, the virus can be deadly for residents and visitors 7 . As we learn more about the virus, no age group or demographic is \"immune\" to its complications, but in the King County facility episode, no deaths occurred among staff members. Reported symptom onset dates for facility residents and staff members ranged from February 16 to March 5, 2020. The median patient age was 81 years To best prevent the spread of COVID-19 from person to person and facility to facility, we must recognize the previous gaps and issues in the system, protocol, and training.

What becomes of the threshold for capacity if patients on the inpatient service refuse necessary tests or vitals to rule out COVID-19? What was once a decision about one's own health becomes a public health question with the risk of spread of a deadly infectious virus. These questions are especially pertinent in the treatment of older adults. One reason is that capacity to make medical decisions is commonly assessed in the setting of disorders of the elderly such as neurocognitive impairment and delirium. Another reason is that as noted by the CDC, older adults are at higher risk of complications from COVID-19, and a decision by one impacts the entire milieu and has consequences for other patients, literally creating a \"toxic environment.\" If the threshold for capacity were to take public health into account, and thus this patient was deemed not to have capacity, is it ethical to obtain the vitals?

Consults to outside services should only be done if absolutely necessary to protect patient safety. As well, consulting teams should include the minimum amount of staff necessary to complete the consult. Follow-up rounding for consults should be done only when absolutely necessary and \"tele-rounding\" performed if possible, as was implemented in France 4 . We instituted this approach in both the Emergency Department and Consultation Liaison services, with positive reception by staff and patients. Staff mobile phones can also harbor infectious agents. In one study performed by Bodena et al. 2019, it was revealed that 94.2% of the mobile phones of health professionals were contaminated with bacteria 5 . Needless to say, phones could also transport COVID-19 and regular phone sanitization could help reduce transmission. Antiseptic wipes should be placed in all staff work areas with reminders to sanitize phones and frequently touched devices. Patients entering the inpatient unit, whether from the emergency department, another hospital floor, or from an outside facility should all follow standardized COVID-19 screening procedures. Patients should be monitored daily for the classic symptoms of cough, shortness of breath, and fever. But as we discuss below, geriatric patients may not show a typical infectious presentation and should be screened following modified guidelines. Suspension of group activities, social distancing, and single patient rooms (if possible) can be effective in decreasing transmission. Despite implementing these measures, there is always a risk that a newly admitted patient is actually COVID-19 positive but asymptomatic. Precautions to address this possibility could include universal mask use by all patients and staff. In addition, newly admitted patients could be placed in a single room for observation for up to five days, but such policies may not be feasible to implement, and five days may be an insufficient time period to identify everyone with an underlying infection. Given the recent findings from Lauer et al. 2020, the median incubation period was estimated to be 5.1 days (95% CI, 4.5 to 5.8 days), and 97.5% of those who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days (CI, 8.2 to 15.6 days) of infection 6 . Ideally, inpatient psychiatric censuses and new admissions should be kept low and limited to only the most psychiatrically ill who are in need of immediate care. This can help reduce infectious spread. While we could not place patients in observation rooms, having a low census allowed for single patient rooms. If COVID-positive patients",

Overall, 56.8% of residents, 35.7% of visitors, and 5.9% of staff members with COVID-19 were hospitalized. Preliminary case fatality rates among residents and visitors as of March 9, 2020 were 27.2% and 7.1%, respectively. The most common chronic underlying conditions among facility residents were hypertension (69.1%), cardiac disease (56.8%), renal disease (43.2%), diabetes (37.0%), obesity (33.3%), and pulmonary disease (32.1%). Six residents and one visitor had hypertension as their only chronic underlying condition.
