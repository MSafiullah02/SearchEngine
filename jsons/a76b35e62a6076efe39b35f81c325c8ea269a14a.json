It demonstrates that the detection rate of respiratory viruses was strongly associated with a low CRP level and influenza-like symptoms on presentation. When comparing the POWH AECOPD data to that of the wider health district (SESLHD) over a similar time period, some interesting observations can be drawn. The microbiological profile of viruses identified between the adults groups was similar, revealing Influenza A to be the most common virus isolated regardless of underlying COPD followed by rhinovirus, RSV and coronaviridae. It would be informative to establish the proportion of patients with COPD in the POWH group that had received the annual influenza vaccination prior to their presentation, but this information was rarely recorded in the medical record. Compared to the general population captured in the SESLHD data, one would expect this at risk group to have more protection against influenza through greater vaccination rates. Viral and bacterial infections trigger AECOPD in up to 80% of cases. 10 Co-infection with bacteria and viruses, as in 22% of our patients, suggests that both classes of organisms play a role. In studies of asthma exacerbations, it appears likely that respiratory viruses are the principal initiating infections, with initial bacterial infections being of lesser importance. While the reason behind lower rates of viral detection in exacerbations of COPD compared to asthma is unclear, the overall detection rate of 55% in this study is slightly higher than other similar studies. 2,3 It would appear likely that viral infections disrupt the airway epithelium, reducing the innate immunity and allowing bacterial secondary infection to occur, as has been previously described. 11 Surrogate markers to discriminate viral and non-viral AECOPD were reviewed in this audit and both symptoms and inflammatory markers were found to be potentially useful indicators. The current guidelines regarding influenza-like symptoms was found to be strongly associated with positive viral results and thus appear to support this clinical assessment as a key aspect of the history obtained on presentation for triage. Further studies associating influenza-like symptoms and rates of droplet precaution isolation with proven viral infection would determine the necessity of an isolation protocol for such patients and be of public health interest to prevent in-hospital spread.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1252, "end": 1254, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1959, "end": 1961, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Previous studies of AECOPD have shown that in patients who have increased sputum purulence, the pattern of increase in CRP is similar to that seen in patients with pneumonia. 12 This suggests that CRP may be used as a marker of significant bacterial infection and may have a role in determining whether antimicrobials should be prescribed.

First, viral infection may have been missed in up to onethird of patients who were not tested on presentation, presumably due to lack of influenza-like symptoms. As viral shedding can occur for several weeks after postinfection, routine testing of all subjects may have affected the study's findings including the associations of symptoms and inflammatory markers. Second, potential selection bias relating to the indication for viral testing exists between the two cohorts limiting the capacity to compare data sets. The AECOPD cohort was a highly selected group of patients, many of whom had symptoms suggestive of a viral infection to prompt testing. In comparison, the indication for testing in the SESLHD cohort is unknown and likely to be variable, including some screening for infection control. In the future, prospective studies could address whether CRP, and perhaps pro-calcitonin, could be used in addition to clinical acumen to guide empirical antimicrobial use in AECOPD.
