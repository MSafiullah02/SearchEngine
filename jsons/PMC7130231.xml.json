However, the diagnosis of SARS in the latter two series was based on the case definitions alone. The common symptoms noted in all three series were fever, nonproductive cough, and myalgia. Fever has been found to be almost universally present in patients with SARS. An intriguing finding in the cohort of Liu et al is that the fever in 51 of the 53 patients preceded cough. For the two patients in whom cough occurred first, the patients had a history of chronic cough. By comparison, Booth et al11 reported that 74% of SARS patients had fever as their first symptom, but 9% of patients had cough or dyspnea alone as the first symptom. However, as the diagnosis of SARS in this series was solely based on case definition, there may have been inclusion of patients without the disease. Both studies suffer from the problems of a retrospective evaluation relying on proper documentation and patient recall. Lee et al10 (Hong Kong) did not report when symptoms first occurred, simply the frequency in which they were reported. If fever preceding cough were a consistent finding in patients with SARS, it could be used along with other findings as a clue in initially assessing a patient's risk for having SARS.",

Thus, the key to controlling SARS is the rapid identification of its presence. Unfortunately, to date no specific clinical, laboratory, or radiologic findings can distinguish with certainty SARS Co-V infection. Even RT-PCR for SARS-CoV presence is fraught with a much higher risk of false-positive results occurring during periods when there is an absence of known person-to-person spread of SARS-CoV infection. Thus, at this time, we are left with using a combination of clinical and epidemiologic factors that suggest this infection. Such factors include the predilection for systemic symptoms (especially fever) to occur prior to respiratory symptoms, for infiltrates on chest radiography to be peripheral and for lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia as well as elevated LFT results to be present. Obviously, a cluster of patients with such findings and no other explanation should raise suspicion for this disease. Clearly, travel history as well as known exposure to SARS-CoV infected patients is also vitally important. Confirmation of the disease will require laboratory testing that includes rapid RT-PCR and antibody testing using enzyme immunoassay. The antibody testing can only be performed later in the patient course.",
