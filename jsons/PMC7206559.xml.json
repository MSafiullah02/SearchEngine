Amplification of the ISR was performed on 107 tuf PCR-positive specimens tested in 2017 and 2018, subsequent to the initial set of 71 specimens used to estimate diagnostic performance in 2016. Visualization of the ISR PCR products revealed that 89 tuf PCR-positive specimens yielded a single ISR band at the 457-bp size expected for the M. cynos genome. The remaining 18 tuf PCR-positive specimens yielded 2 bands; one at the size expected for the M. cynos genome and a second smaller band (Fig. 3). Ninety-four PCR products were purified and were directly sequenced (91 of the amplicon size expected for M. cynos and 3 smaller). Of the 91 amplicon sequences expected to be M. cynos, NCBI BLAST revealed that 82 were \u2265 99.6% identical to the M. cynos ISR sequence, 1 sequence shared high identity with M. mucosicanis ISR sequence, and the remaining 8 had poor sequence quality that prevented definitive identification of the Mycoplasma species present in the specimen.

On the OA platform, reaction efficiencies were high compared to typical benchmarks for the 7500 platform given the fact that samples were pre-amplified and visualized using a white LED excitation source.

The sequence confirmation data, supported by phylogenetic analysis, provided robust support for the specificity of the tuf PCR assay. The discrepant results identified between ISR sequencing and the new tuf assay, including the identification of M. mucosicanis in a tuf PCR-positive specimen, suggest instances of mixed Mycoplasma infections. This was supported by the visualization of multiple bands upon ISR amplification, with 16.8% of tuf PCR-positive specimens producing 2 distinct ISR amplicons.

Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA X, and the tree was inferred using the neighbor-joining method.14,22 The bootstrap test with 1,000 replicates was used to determine the percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered, and these values are shown next to the branches.9 Phylogenetic clustering of Mycoplasma strains is distinguished by color; sequences determined in our work by PCR amplicon sequencing are denoted by \u201cCornell ISR\u201d prefix. Sequences identified multiple times are indicated by (#) following the name, with \u2018#\u2019 reflecting the number of times that sequence was obtained. Sequences determined by whole genome sequencing of ATCC type strains in our laboratory are indicated by the text \u201ctype strain.\u201d The ISR sequence of Acholeplasma laidlawii was included as an outgroup. Sequences obtained from GenBank include A. laidlawii (CP000896) and the following Mycoplasma species: M. arginini (AY737013), M. bovigenitalium (AP017902), M. bovis (CP002513), M. canadense (AY800341), M. canis (AF443605), M. cynos (NC_019949), M. edwardii (AF443607), M. felis (AF443608), M. gateae (AF443609), M. maculosum (AF443610), M. mucosicanis (FM180556), M. opalescens (AF443612), M. spumans (AF538684), and M. synoviae (AJ781002).",
