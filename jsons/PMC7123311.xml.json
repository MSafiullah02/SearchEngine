            "text": "The prevalence of most infectious diseases is often assumed to emerge from person-to-person interactions among a population of individuals who are considered homogeneous with respect to contact, transmission, and recovery behavior. However, it is more realistic to assume that diseases spread among a heterogeneous population. Host heterogeneity may be due to physiological, behavioral, or immunological differences [33]. Behavioral differences may also be related to the environmental setting [33]. For example, some individuals are at a higher risk for spreading the disease due to increased contact with susceptible persons or longer length of infection. This has been observed in the spread of sexually transmitted and vector-borne diseases, where high-risk individuals are characterized by the \u201c20/80\u201d rule, in which 20% of the infected individuals are responsible for 80% of the disease transmission [21, 41]. The 2002\u20132003 SARS epidemic highlighted the role of superspreaders (SS), defined as people who infect a large number of individuals, in comparison to nonsuperspreaders (NS) who transmit the disease to few or none [6, 15, 30, 40]. However, the exact characteristics of SS and their impact on disease dynamics are difficult to define. Lloyd et al. studied the effects of heterogeneity in infectiousness and then found that the proportion of SS contributed to high levels of heterogeneity for several infectious diseases (e.g., SARS, measles, influenza, rubella, smallpox, Ebola, and other diseases) [26]. Currently, there are no well-known methods for identifying SS in the population or control efforts to reduce the disease transmission at the individual or population levels based on SS. We consider two infectious diseases, Ebola and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), that are associated with certain cultural and health behaviors for which contact patterns may be traceable. Focusing on these two epidemic cases, we will provide insight into disease patterns associated with superspreading events.",

            "text": "Ebola virus was first discovered in 1976 in Africa, in the country now named the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near the Ebola river. Ebola virus can persist in the environment through animal-to-animal transmission, e.g., bats can transmit the virus to apes, monkeys, antelopes, and other animals. The virus can also be transmitted to humans through contact with infected animals in the environment during hunting, meat preparation, or from an animal bite. Infection can be transmitted to other humans through contact with bodily fluids, such as blood, secretions, and organs of sick or diseased individuals, or with contaminated objects, such as bedding and clothes. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the 2014\u20132016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa had the most cases and deaths of any Ebola outbreak to date [38]. This spread might have been increased due to infected health-care workers\u2019 close contact with susceptible individuals. Additionally, burial ceremonies may increase contact with infectious deceased bodies that contain the virus. The incubation period, defined as the time of infection to onset of symptoms, ranges from 2 to 21 days [38]. Individuals can recover from Ebola; however, mortality rates range from 25 to 90%. In 2016, the WHO announced that the first vaccine trial implemented in Guinea was 100% effective [17, 37]. The recent preventive measures announced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) include: reducing contacts with infected animals or bodily fluids of infected individuals, isolating infected and deceased individuals, early detection of infected individuals, and maintaining a clean environment [8].",

However, most cases are not due to camel-to-human infections. MERS outbreaks among humans arise from human-to-human interactions, where many cases occur in healthcare settings with poor health prevention and control practices. In 2015, an outbreak of MERS in South Korea was driven by three SS, initiated with one SS contracting MERS during international travel. The first SS was responsible for 29 secondary infections through various clinical visits. Two subsequently infected individuals were responsible for 106 tertiary infections [39, 40]. Individuals infected with MERS can be asymptomatic, while others may experience the following symptoms: fever, coughs, shortness of breath, diarrhea, and pneumonia. Nearly, 35% of MERS cases resulted in death. While no vaccine or treatments are available, individuals are advised to maintain good hygiene when coming into contact with animals, particularly camels, such as washing hands and avoiding contact with sick animals. Additional prevention strategies include consuming thoroughly cooked and prepared animal products [39].",

Additional classes for asymptomatic, hospitalized, or isolated individuals were also included in MERS models [11, 23]. Time-dependent transmission parameters accounted for superspreading events (e.g., [22\u201324]). Superspreading events have also been investigated with multitype branching processes by including individual heterogeneity in offspring generating functions [18, 26]. All of these models have contributed to a better understanding of the role of superspreaders in disease outbreaks. Our models incorporate the compartmental framework and apply stochastic simulations with theory from branching processes to further elucidate the role of superspreaders in disease dynamics.",

Specifically, we aim to study the disease dynamics in a heterogeneous population consisting of SS and NS individuals, and develop a deterministic model based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs) which is expanded to a stochastic model that is implemented as a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) system and approximated by a multitype branching process [1, 2]. We incorporate estimated parameter values from published data of prior MERS and Ebola epidemics into our models. Next, we compute the basic reproduction number for the ODE model, and perform sensitivity analysis using Latin hypercube sampling and partial rank correlation. By varying the initial size of SS and model parameters of the CTMC model, we derive and verify analytical estimates obtained using multitype branching process approximations with model simulations to predict the probability of an epidemic outbreak. In further numerical simulations of the CTMC model, we compute sample paths, probability of outbreak, number of deaths, time to outbreak, time to peak infection, and peak number of infectious individuals. Our analyses and numerical simulations reveal how SS influence the dynamics of epidemic outbreaks, which may provide useful insight for public health interventions.",

It has been used to approximate the dynamics of the CTMC model near the DFE and the stochastic threshold for a disease outbreak [1\u20133, 36]. In fact, the stochastic threshold (i.e., probability of a disease outbreak) is directly related to the basic reproduction number as defined in the corresponding deterministic model (2.1) (see [3, 36]). More specifically, if the basic reproduction is less than unity, then disease extinction occurs with probability one. In this case, the branching process is called subcritical. However, if the basic reproduction number is greater than unity, the probability of disease extinction is less than one (probability of outbreak is greater than zero) and the process is referred to as supercritical.",

We include this calculation in Appendix 2.

Specifically, if \u03c1(M) < 1, q\n1 = \u22ef = q\n6 = 1, then the extinction probability is one; if \u03c1(M) > 1, then there exists a unique fixed point (q\n1, \u22ef , q\n6) \u2208 (0, 1)6, and hence the extinction probability is strictly less than one. By the Threshold Theorem of reference [3], it follows that the spectral radius of the matrix M is strictly less than one if and only if the basic reproduction number is strictly less than one. Analogous statements hold whenever the spectral radius of M is equal to one or is strictly greater than one.",

Latin hypercube sampling (LHS), first developed by McKay et al. [29], with the statistical sensitivity measure partial rank correlation coefficient (PRCC), performs a sensitivity analysis that explores a defined parameter space of the model. The parameter space considered is defined by the parameter intervals depicted in Table 2. Rather than simply exploring one parameter at a time with other parameters held fixed at baseline values, the LHS/PRCC sensitivity analysis method globally explores multidimensional parameter space. LHS is a stratified Monte Carlo sampling without replacement technique that allows an unbiased estimate of the average model output with limited samples. The PRCC sensitivity analysis technique works well for parameters that have a nonlinear and monotonic relationship with the output measure. PRCC shows how the output measure is influenced by changes in a specific parameter value when the linear effects of other parameter values are removed. The PRCC values were calculated as Spearman (rank) partial correlations using the partialcorr function in MATLAB 2016. Their significances, uncorrelated p-values, were also determined. The PRCC values vary between \u22121 and 1, where negative values indicate that the parameter is inversely proportional to the output measure. Following Marino et al. [27], we performed a z-test on transformed PRCC values to rank significant model parameters in terms of relative sensitivity. According to the z-test, parameters with larger magnitude PRCC values had a stronger effect on the output measures.",

Monotonicity was observed for all parameters except \u03bc\nI2 with total SS deaths, which exhibited two monotonic ranges [0.02, 0.0278] and [0.0278, 0.14]. For non-monotonic trends, alternative methods based on decomposition of model output variances such as eFAST (extended Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test) can be used instead of PRCC [27]; however, since all other parameters were monotonic, we use PRCC and just consider the two monotonic ranges of \u03bc\nI2 separately. PRCC analysis of these two ranges produces similar results. For an analysis of the monotonicity, refer to Appendix 3. Once meeting the monotonicity requirements, we proceed to utilize LHS with PRCC for both MERS and Ebola parameters. For each disease, we calculate the PRCC for the following output measures: total NS cases, total SS cases, total NS deaths, and total SS deaths. The number of total cases refers to the total number of transmission events where susceptible individuals become exposed (latently infected) individuals. For the outputs of NS/SS cases, the PRCC results were similar in both Ebola and MERS. According to the PRCC values, the \u03b2\n2 and \u03bc\nI2 are significant in the model for MERS. Meanwhile, in the Ebola model, both transmission parameters are significant in the model (see Fig. 2).

The statistical significance of the difference between NS- and SS-initiated epidemics is confirmed with a Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test (p < 0.001) [28]. It is clear that the distributions are bimodal. This is due to the fact that there may be only a minor outbreak (with probability q\n3 or q\n6) with none or a few deaths or a major outbreak (with probability 1 \u2212 q\n3 or 1 \u2212 q\n6) with a significant number of deaths.\n",

For each fraction of the population initially infected, there are 1000 points, one point from each of the 1000 sample paths, representing the total number of deaths over a 150-day time period. As expected, we find that as the number of initially infected NS individuals increases, the expected number of deaths increases as well (Fig. 6). Interestingly, we find a threshold response as the fraction of initially infected SS individuals increases. As the fraction of initially infected SS individuals increases beyond 0.005 for MERS (Fig. 6b) and 0.0075 for Ebola (Fig. 6d), we find that the simulation always gives rise to an outbreak, resulting in a maximal number of around 1000 deaths over a 150-day simulated period. We also note that there is a decrease in the variability in the number of deaths when the outbreak is initiated by an SS rather than an NS, which contributes to this threshold response. The seemingly binary response in the number of deaths resulting from a MERS or Ebola epidemic initiated by infected SS individuals who only contribute to 0.5\u20130.75% of the starting population is a good indication that by tracking the number of deaths in an epidemic, the presence of an SS may be predicted. Thus, while the observation that an outbreak has occurred does not necessarily suggest the existence of SS individuals in the population, the severity of the outbreak in terms of lives lost may be more suggestive of the presence of an SS, especially when the number of known initial infections is low.\n",

To investigate this, we calculated mean (\u00b1 SD) of time to peak infection (in days) for MERS and Ebola, where the percent of SS varied in the susceptible population (see Fig. 9a\u2013b). Mean differences between the introduction of 1 infected NS (black) compared to 1 infected SS (white) were assessed separately as the percent of SS varied (e.g., 5%, 25%, and 50%) using t-tests where statistical significance was accepted when p < 0.05. For MERS, time to peak infection was slightly significantly lower for SS when 5% and 25% of the susceptible population was SS, but not significant when 50% of the population was SS (Fig. 9a). For Ebola, time to peak infection was significantly lower for SS regardless of changes in the percent of SS in the susceptible population (Fig. 9b). Hence, while the differences in mean time to peak infection between SS and NS-initiated epidemics are only modestly different, we find their difference to be statistically significant (Fig. 9a\u2013b). Thus, this confirmed that epidemics initiated by infected SS individuals reaches its peak value more quickly.\n",

For example, the 2003 outbreak of the respiratory infection SARS in Beijing found that SS had higher mortality rates, higher attack rates, and greater number of contacts in comparison to NS [40]. From a public health perspective, as SS events will be observed more frequently, intervention/prevention methods must have rapid response to reduce disease severity. For example, Wong et al. [40] suggested that several community-based efforts could have been made to reduce the number of MERS and Ebola cases in Guinea and Sierra Leone, such as tracking contacts, earlier diagnosis, treatment strategies, and community education. Effective responses to control superspreading events and reduce disease transmission in MERS and Ebola outbreaks included: \u201cearly discovery, diagnosis, intervention, and quarantine of confirmed cases.\u201d [40]. Other epidemics that are more likely to occur in hospital settings, e.g., SARS, could be controlled through hospital administrative strategies, such as reducing contact between the infected patient and healthcare workers, visitors, or other patients whose immune system may be comprised due to other infections [32]. Thus, a rapid response is needed to reduce disease severity of SS events.",

We applied our models to emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, MERS and Ebola, where the models were parameterized with data from the literature but with a fixed initial population size of 2000. There are a number of extensions and generalizations that we will consider in the future work. We assumed homogeneous mixing and only two types of classifications of individuals (NS/SS) for the entire population. Generalizing this model to include heterogeneous mixing and spatial components are key features that can provide insight on how a superspreaders can be classified. In our model, we considered inter-host variability, which naturally leads to constructing a model with intra-host variability utilizing stochastic differential equations or other types of models. In addition, variability of the pathogen on epidemic dynamics can be explored. Additionally, we will validate our models\u2019 findings against time series data, test our models\u2019 abilities to detect the presence of SS, and interpret the results for public health implementation. Finding answers to these problems will lead to our ultimate goal of constructing novel ways to quantify, characterize, and identify an SS during the initiation of an outbreak.",
