            "text": "Primers were designed and tested for their ability to distinguish rhinoviruses from enteroviruses. A primer set derived from the 5'-UTRNP coding region junction was able to amplify all the rhinovirus serotypes tested. Enteroviruses were either not amplified by these primer pairs or produced a band of larger size that could easily be discriminated from the rhinovirus-specific product. In contrast, primers embedded in the 5'-UTR region alone were able to amplify both rhinovirus and enterovirus RNA. It is shown that rhinoviruses could be specifically typed by sequencing the amplicon derived from this 5'-UTR set. The sequences of the 5'-UTR region of ten previously unsequenced rhinoviruses were derived. The sequences obtained cluster into two groups: l B , 41, 15,30,63,31, 56, and 44; and 17, 69, and 70. Amplicons from serotypes 17,69, and 70 also group by sequence with the equivalent region of HRV14 from the genetic database, while the others group with 2 and 89. o",

            "text": "There are more than 100 rhinovirus serotypes within the family Picornaviridae IGwaltney et al., 19891 . Rhinoviruses infect the upper respiratory tract, cause typical common cold illness, and are implicated in other respiratory conditions [Balfour-Lynn et al., 19921 . Rhinoviruses are traditionally distinguished from other members of the Picornaviridae by their acid lability, and can be typed by neutralisation with specific antisera after growth in tissue culture. Some are untypeable and probably represent new serotypes [Couch, 19921. Improved means of characterising the rhinoviruses should help specific diagnosis and contribute to research into the common cold. Such methods should also clarify the number of viruses in the genus. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) genetic amplification provides an obvious way of investigating respiratory virus infections and has already been described for adenoviruses, coronaviruses, influenza viruses, parainfluenza virus, and respiratory synctial virus lBecker and Darai, 1992; Persing et al., 19931 . Several groups have described assays for rhinovirus RNA using primers from conserved sequences within the 5'-untranslated region (UTR) of the genome [Arruda and Hayden, 1993; Bruce et al., 1990; Gama et al., 1988 Gama et al., , 1989 Hyypia et al., 1989; Olive et al., 19901. The 5'-UTR of the picornaviruses contains the internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) and the conserved sequences are probably essential for this function [Jang et al., 19901 . The length of the UTR differs between the enteroviruses and the rhinoviruses [Agol, 19911 and thus provides a means of differentiating the 5' PCR amplicons of these viruses [Olive et al., 19901 . While a set of PCR primers that amplifies the cDNA of all enteroviruses and rhinoviruses is useful, it would also be useful to be able to detect the two groups of viruses separately. We have attempted to do this by designing and testing sets of rhinovirus-specific primers from other (coding) regions of the genome. In addition we have investigated sequencing of the PCR products as a means of typing the virus from which the amplified RNA originated. This can only be successful for those viruses for which sequence information is available. At the time of writing, the sequences of the 5' end of 11 enteroviruses (PV1, 2, 3; CAV9, 21, 24; CBV1, 3, 4, 5; EV70) and 4 rhinoviruses (HRVlB, 2, 14, 89) are available in the genetic databases (GenBank and EMBL). We have sequenced the 5' amplicons of 10 previously unsequenced rhinoviruses (HRV15, 17, 30, 31, 41, 44, 56, 63, 69, 70) and 1, HRVlB, that was previously sequenced to demonstrate the usefulness of this technique as a means of virus identification. This work extends knowledge of the genomic sequence diversity of this group of viruses.",

Of the primer sets chosen to be specific for the rhinoviruses, both sets 1 and 2 were able to amplify all the serotypes tested (Figs. 2, 3) . Because of the slightly better efficiency of set 2 and the larger size of its amplicon (185 vs 76 bp), these primers were chosen to be tested against a range of enteroviruses. Specific amplification was not observed for any of them (Fig. 3) . Thus, the set 2 primers may allow for differentiation between enterovirus and rhinovirus RNA merely by the presence or absence of a band of correct size on a gel. As we were not able to test all members of the Picornaviridae with these primers their full usefulness remains to be determined, and it may also be necessary to have a sequence confirmation for any ethidium bromide-stained band. Notwithstanding these reservations, the set 2 primers should provide a useful screening assay for rhinovirus RNA.",

The extent to which this can be done will depend on the sequences of appropriate PCR target regions being determined for cultured viruses of known serotype. (Assuming that the cloning and sequencing of the entire genome of all known picornavirus serotypes will not be performed in the near future.) The choice of an appropriate amplicon to sequence is determined by its size and the extent to which the primers can be expected to be conserved among the different serotypes of the virus genus and family. Obviously, the amplicons of primer sets 3 and 4 would not be appropriate as this study has shown their primers are insufficiently conserved. Although the sequence amplified by the set 2 primers would seem a good choice for rhinovirus genomic typing, the amplicon could be considered to be a little too short, at 185 bp, to generate sufficient information. We therefore chose to investigate the sequence divergence of the amplicon produced by the 5'-UTR primers. This is just under 300 bp, depending on the specific virus target and the primers used, and is thus an ideal size for sequence determination on an average gel. Also, this sequence can be amplified with the same primers for both the enteroviruses and the rhinoviruses. When, ultimately, there is a database of the 5'-UTR sequences of all the members of the Picornaviridae it will allow typing by the PCR and sequencing method described in this work.",
