Face masks, for example, were unavailable for many weeks and have fueled a disreputable black market. Moreover, there were no exact provisions for physicians who were following patients at home. In Palermo, a metropolitan city of Southern Italy, in March the requests of home care assistance doubled compared to the same period of the previous year, putting stressed teams accustomed to following fewer patients. This was due to a reduced possibility of hospitalization and the shortage of beds for patients with cancer or noncancer chronic diseases. Ironically, some patients refused the visits for fear of contagion (3).",

The government issued increasingly stringent decrees to limit the conduct of daily life with the aim of preventing contagion. Irrespective of the obligations for health personnel, serious restrictions have also been introduced for relatives, with limitations or prohibitions on visits. They too were forced to use personal protective equipment. All this caused a surreal atmosphere for palliative care in which the presence of a family member next to the patient is essential. Patients remain alone all the day without support, except that provided by the health workers. It is well known that family support in a Mediterranean country is of paramount importance. In response some patients can ask to be discharged earlier than necessary. Sadly, some others die without any final contact with relatives or say good-bye before being admitted to hospice.",

Indeed, some hospices stopped their activities. To partially overcome these issues we have been adopted \"WhatsApp\" to get family members to participate in clinical rounds (4) .

Two relatives refused, six had their loved one unable to communicate. One patient did not agree with the relatives' interview. In such cases information was given by telephone. Thus, sixteen family members were interviewed. Seven patients did not have a smart telephone or an e-Paid. In these cases, a smart phone was offered by the team. The characteristics of patients and family members who agreed with the interview and scores regarding the questionnaire are reported in Table 1 . Most family members were happy to virtually attend the visit: \"I was happy to see him and you while talking about the treatment\"; \"It was a pleasure to note the smart atmosphere surrounding my loved one you created \"; \"I was happy to be updated on the results of the investigations and treatment you proposed, explaining the reasons for such decisions\"; \"I liked to share your information about the treatments and the next follow-up, albeit at a distance\". \"I was happily surprised by this initiative\". However, most of relatives also added: \"I recognize the actual situation is regulated by law, but no technology can provide the same effects experienced by my presence\" or \"It could be the last time I see him/her\". Thus, some of the problems related to government restrictions, could be overcome with simple technology available to most population, proposing a temporary, hopefully, communication model of adaptation to this crisis.",
