            "text": "The immune response against central nervous system (CNS) infection requires a delicate balance between efficient pathogen clearance and the preservation of sensitive, nonrenewable neural cells. It is becoming evident that following CNS insult and acute inflammation, the brain does not return to its preinfection state; animal models of neurodegenerative disease, multiple sclerosis, stroke, and brain infection each show prolonged activation of resident microglia and sustained presence of memory T\u2010cells. Overactive and persistent immune activation within the brain can be detrimental to sensitive neuronal cells resulting in focal neuropathology and, correspondingly, memory deficits (Armien et al., 2010). Thus, suppression of persistent brain inflammation is critical to limiting bystander tissue damage and preserving neurological function.",

            "text": "Microglia are the resident immune cells of the brain and have been traditionally thought to be proinflammatory. Recent studies, however, suggest they play additional roles as immune regulators. Microglia limit CNS pathology by suppressing proinflammatory cytokine production from brain\u2010infiltrating T\u2010cells through activation of the programmed death receptor\u20101 (PD\u20101): programmed death ligand\u20101 (PD\u2010L1) pathway. PD\u2010L1 (CD274, B7\u2010H1), a co\u2010inhibitory molecule expressed on antigen presenting cells, which plays a crucial role in the functional suppression of T\u2010cell responses (Latchman et al., 2004). Engagement of PD\u20101 on activated CD4+ and CD8+ T\u2010cells by PD\u2010L1 has been shown as a mechanism for suppression of T\u2010cell function, commonly referred to as T\u2010cell exhaustion. In the absence of PD\u2010L1 (PD\u2010L1\u2212/\u2212 mice), coronavirus infection of the brain resulted in a heightened inflammatory response, ultimately leading to the more rapid clearance of virus from the CNS (Phares et al., 2013). This comes at a cost however, PD\u2010L1\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited quicker onset of clinical symptoms and a higher rate of mortality, demonstrating the importance of this pathway in negatively regulating neuroinflammation in the brain. PD\u2010L1 expression on microglia, as well as on astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, has been shown to decrease T\u2010cell activation in models of multiple sclerosis, as well as during acute viral encephalitis (Duncan and Miller, 2011; Magnus et al., 2005; Phares et al., 2009). However, little is known about the immunoregulatory role of microglia during chronic, persistent neuroinflammation in animals that recover from viral brain infection.",

            "text": "Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) brain infection is the most significant cause of neurological disorders related to intrauterine infection in humans and is also a major cause of encephalitis during acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (Cheeran et al., 2009a). Using a mouse model of murine (M) CMV infection, we have previously shown that, in the aftermath of a nonlethal acute viral infection, the CNS is maintained in a state of chronic neuroinflammation. Sustained immune activation within the brain is a key feature of herpesvirus pathogenicity (Armien et al., 2010), along with the establishment of latency after clearance of acute infection and the potential for virus reactivation (Fields, 2007). Prolonged immune responses within the brain following MCMV infection are characterized by persistence of antibody\u2010producing B\u2010cells, chronic microglial cell activation, and retention of MCMV\u2010specific effector\u2010memory CD8+ T\u2010cells (Mutnal et al., 2011b; Mutnal et al., 2012). Although CD8+ T\u2010cells play an important role in controlling acute brain infection (Reddehase et al., 1987, 1985), the chronic presence of these IFN\u2010\u03b3\u2010producing T\u2010cells may be damaging to the brain. Although retention of antigen\u2010specific CD8+ T\u2010cells following MCMV infection helps to protect against virus reactivation, they are also responsible for long\u2010term activation of microglia throughout the brain (Mutnal et al., 2011b). Cytotoxic CD8 T\u2010lymphocytes have been shown responsible for the destruction of healthy bystander neurons in the retina (McPherson et al., 2006). Thus, maintaining CD8+ T\u2010cells in a functionally suppressed state in the brain may enable both adequate neuroprotection from subsequent infection or reactivation, while also limiting unnecessary bystander neurotoxicity.",

This infection is rapidly cleared through the action of microglia, the resident CNS immune sentinels, and the recruitment of innate and adaptive immune cells from the periphery. We have previously shown that this acute and controlled viral brain infection results in chronic neuroinflammation that can persist for at least 30 d following viral clearance (Mutnal et al., 2011b). Isolation and flow cytometry of brain mononuclear cells (BMNCs), including microglia and CNS\u2010infiltrating leukocytes, from MCMV\u2010infected mice showed that microglia upregulate the surrogate activation marker, MHC Class II, during the acute phase of infection and continue to chronically express this protein on their surface (Mutnal et al., 2011b). MHC Class II expression on microglia is notably absent in sham\u2010, mock\u2010, and uninfected mice. In this study, we first confirmed this widespread and prolonged expression of MHC Class II on microglia using immunohistochemistry.

It is not known whether similar mechanisms are involved in the inhibition of T\u2010cells persisting within the CNS during chronic neuroinflammation in the absence of active viral replication. Using our MCMV brain infection model, we first examined the kinetics of PD\u2010L1 expression on microglia from the acute, productive phase of infection (7 dpi) into the chronic neuroinflammatory, postviral clearance phase (30 dpi). Resting microglia, which are identified by flow cytometry as the CD45intCD11b+ population, in uninfected mice expressed low levels of PD\u2010L1. In contrast, during the acute phase of viral infection PD\u2010L1 surface expression on microglia increased dramatically (control = 19.7% vs. MCMV\u2010infected = 90.6%) and remained elevated during persistent neuroinflammation (29.4%; Fig. 1B).",

Using primary microglial cells, we directly examined the inhibitory effects of microglial PD\u2010L1 on CD8+ T\u2010cell activation. First, we confirmed the activation and upregulation of PD\u2010L1 on cultured microglial in response to IFN\u2010\u03b3, TNF\u03b1, and IL\u20101\u03b2, proinflammatory cytokines found during acute and chronic infection (Armien et al., 2010; Marques et al., 2008; Mutnal et al., 2011b). IFN\u2010\u03b3, TNF\u03b1, or IL\u20101\u03b2 stimulation for 24 h resulted in a four\u2010fold increase in PD\u2010L1 mRNA expression in microglia, compared with unstimulated controls (Fig. 3A).

These data confirmed previous reports that resting microglia express low levels of PD\u2010L1 (Magnus et al., 2005).

Astrocytes were stimulated with IFN\u2010\u03b3 for 24 h before being co\u2010cultured with the CD8+ T\u2010cells. Co\u2010cultures of unstimulated CD8+ T\u2010cells with astrocytes produced negligible levels of IFN\u2010\u03b3 and IL\u20102 in the culture supernatant (Fig. 7A,B). As expected, anti\u2010CD3\u2010stimulated CD8+ T\u2010cells resulted in a significant increase in IFN\u2010\u03b3 (P < 0.001) and IL\u20102 (P < 0.001). Blockade of PD\u2010L1 on astrocytes using an anti\u2010PD\u2010L1 neutralizing antibody enhanced CD8+ T\u2010cell IFN\u2010\u03b3 (P < 0.001) and IL\u20102 (P = 0.003) production.

Observations in animal models of brain infection and disease show that chronic neuroinflammation typically consists of the retention of CD8+ T\u2010cells and heightened activation of MHC Class II on resident microglia. A similar profile for chronic brain inflammation is reported in this study, where immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry show that approximately 30% of microglia continue to express the surrogate marker for glial cell activation, MHC Class II, at 30 dpi (Fig. 1), long past clearance of active viral replication in the brain. We also confirmed previous findings that, as MCMV brain infection progressed from the productive phase into the chronic persistent phase, the percent of CD8+ T\u2010cells within the CD45+CD11blow leukocyte population increased from 30% (7 dpi) to 65% (30 dpi; Fig. 2), making CD8+ T\u2010cells the predominant brain\u2010infiltrating immune cell type following viral encephalitis. Furthermore, to our knowledge, this study is the first to report the upregulation and maintained expression of MHC Class II on astrocytes during MCMV\u2010infection (Fig. 6).",

PD\u20101 binding with the negative co\u2010stimulatory molecule PD\u2010L1, which is upregulated on antigen presenting cells, is a well\u2010known mechanism for suppression of CD8+ T\u2010cell proliferation and function (Dong et al., 1999; Kobata et al., 2000; Sharpe and Freeman, 2002). Microglia are the foremost antigen presenting cells of the brain, as evidenced through their expression of MHC Class I and II in response to brain infection (Neumann, 2001; Sedgwick et al., 1993). As previously reported (Magnus et al., 2005), we found low basal expression of PD\u2010L1 on microglia, approximately 20% of cells in uninfected mice expressed surface PD\u2010L1 (Fig. 1). PD\u2010L1 expression on microglia increased robustly during the acute stage of infection, coinciding with the infiltration of IFN\u2010\u03b3\u2010secreting CD8+ T\u2010cells and increased CNS TNF\u03b1 (Cheeran et al., 2007). Similarly, IFN\u2010\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 treatment increased PD\u2010L1 on in vitro cultured microglia, confirming the role of those cytokines in PD\u2010L1 upregulation (Fig. 3). Furthermore, we found that blockade of the PD\u20101 pathway with either PD\u20101 or PD\u2010L1 neutralizing antibody, both in vitro and in ex vivo brain leukocyte extracts, resulted in increased CD8+ T\u2010cell IFN\u2010\u03b3 and IL\u20102 production. These data demonstrate that microglia suppress CD8+ T\u2010cell function, as indicated by IFN\u2010\u03b3 and IL\u20102 production, through the PD\u20101: PD\u2010L1 pathway.",

Similarly, Duncan et al. showed that microglia in the CNS during active Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) infection, which is used as a model for multiple sclerosis, upregulate PD\u2010L1. Using neutralizing antibody to PD\u2010L1, they showed that ex vivo microglia suppressed CD4+ and CD8+ T\u2010cell cytokine production through engagement of the T\u2010cell PD\u20101 receptor. In vivo blockade of PD\u2010L1, again using neutralizing antibody, resulted in decreased viral loads, but also caused an increase in mortality, presumably through exacerbated immune\u2010mediated damage to the nervous system (Duncan and Miller, 2011). Although these previous studies have primarily focused on PD\u2010L1 in managing T\u2010cell function during acute viral CNS infection, the present study shows the involvement of this negative regulatory pathway in inhibiting persistent CD8+ T\u2010cell function during postviral encephalitic chronic neuroinflammation. Specifically, treatment of isolated BMNCs, consisting of microglia and brain\u2010infiltrating leukocytes, with PD\u2010L1 neutralizing antibody increased the production of IFN\u2010\u03b3 and IL\u20102 from MCMV\u2010IE1168\u2013176\u2010stimulated memory CD8+ T\u2010cells (Fig. 5). These experiments were performed on cells extracted from MCMV\u2010infected brains at 14 dpi, approximately 1 week following the clearance of active viral infection. To our knowledge, this is the first experiment demonstrating the role of microglial PD\u2010L1 on inhibiting brain CD8+ T\u2010cells during chronic neuroinflammation and in the absence of productive viral infection.",

In this study, we corroborate previous findings that IFN\u2010\u03b3 robustly upregulates MHC Class II expression on purified cultures of murine astrocytes. In addition, we report that IFN\u2010\u03b3 stimulation\u2010induced PD\u2010L1 upregulation on purified astrocytes in vitro, suggesting the involvement of astrocytes as an additional immunosuppressive cell type. Indeed, Pittet et al. have previously shown that IFN\u2010\u03b3 stimulation of purified cultures of human astrocytes\u2010induced surface PD\u2010L1 expression, which suppress T\u2010lymphocytes via engagement of PD\u20101 on the surface of CD8 cells (Pittet et al., 2011). Furthermore, we confirmed that astrocytes regulate T\u2010cells by inhibiting CD8+ T\u2010cell cytokine production through the physical engagement of T\u2010cell\u2010expressed PD\u20101 and glial\u2010expressed PD\u2010L1 (Gold et al., 1996). As techniques for isolating and culturing astrocytes from the brains of adult mice become available, ex vivo verification of T\u2010cell suppression by astrocytes by this pathway will be required. Multiple studies have clearly shown that, in relation to effector T\u2010cell stimulation, microglia are superior to astrocytes. IFN\u03b3 induces microglia expression of T\u2010cell co\u2010stimulatory molecules (CD80 and CD86) that are necessary second\u2010signals for glia to functionally activate T\u2010cells (Aloisi, 2001). To our knowledge, there have been no reports of astrocytes either expressing these co\u2010stimulatory molecules or being able to effectively activate T\u2010cells (Cross and Ku, 2000). Studies by Magnus et al., suggest that while astrocytes and microglia both inhibit T\u2010cell function, the effect is more pronounced in the latter cell type (Magnus et al., 2005). Our in vitro studies show that PD\u2010L1 neutralization resulted in more potent recovery of CD8+ T\u2010cell IFN\u2010\u03b3 production in astrocyte co\u2010cultures (2.4\u2010fold increase) compared with microglia co\u2010cultures (1.5\u2010fold). PD\u2010L1 neutralization had comparable effects on IL\u20102 production in both microglia and astrocyte co\u2010cultures. These data suggest a more potent role for astrocytes in CD8+ T\u2010cell suppression in the brain. Such conclusions, however, cannot be drawn from the experiments conducted in this study because of our inability to assess the percentage of PD\u2010L1 expression on astrocytes in the postencephalitic brain or to evaluate the effect of PD\u2010L1 neutralization on astrocytes using ex vivo glial: BMNC co\u2010cultures.",

Conversely, maintaining an antigen\u2010specific CD8+ T\u2010cell population in the brain would aide in the rapid clearance of reactivated virus from latently infected neurons (Mutnal et al., 2012; Tsutsui et al., 1995).

Astrocyte cultures were pretreated for 8 h with IFN\u2010\u03b3 (200 U/mL) to stimulated PD\u2010L1 expression. CD8+ T\u2010cells were added at a 10:1 CD8: Glial cell ratio. Prior to CD8+ T\u2010cell addition, astrocyte cultures were left untreated (control) or treated for 2 h with \u03b1\u2010PD\u2010L1, \u03b1\u2010PD\u2010L2, or \u03b1\u2010PD\u20101 neutralizing antibody. Treatment with rat IgG2a was used as an isotype antibody control. Supernatants were collected at 24 h and ELISA run for IFN\u2010\u03b3 (A) and IL\u20102 (B). Histograms are representative of three separate experiments. *P \u2264 0.01, **P \u2264 0.001.",
