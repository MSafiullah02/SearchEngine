However, achieving comprehensive sequencing of viruses-similar to the use of microarrays for differential detection [14] [15] [16] -is challenging owing to the enormous diversity of viral genomes. A recent study used a probe set to target a large panel of viral species simultaneously but did not attempt to cover strain diversity in the probe design 17 . Other studies have designed probe sets to more comprehensively target viral diversity and tested their performance 18, 19 . These overcome the primary limitation of singlevirus enrichment methods, that is, having to know a priori the taxon of interest. However, these existing probe sets that target viral diversity have been designed with ad hoc approaches and are not publicly available.",

This typically represents all known genomic diversity of one or more species. CATCH designs a set of sequences for oligonucleotide probes using a model for determining whether a probe hybridizes to a region of target sequence (Methods and Supplementary Fig. 1a ); the probes designed by CATCH include guarantees concerning the capture of input diversity under this model. CATCH searches for an optimal probe set given a desired number of oligonucleotides to output, which might be determined by factors such as cost or synthesis constraints. The input to CATCH is one or more datasets, each composed of sequences of any length, that need not be aligned to one another. In this study, each dataset consists of genomes from one species, or closely related taxa, that we seek to target. CATCH incorporates various parameters that govern hybridization ( Supplementary Fig. 1b) , such as sequence complementarity between probe and target, and accepts different values for each dataset (Supplementary Fig. 1c ). This allows, for example, more diverse datasets to be assigned less stringent conditions than others. Assume we have a function s(d, \u03b8 d ) that gives a probe set for a single dataset d using hybridization parameters \u03b8 d , and let S({\u03b8 d }) represent the union of s(d, \u03b8 d ) across all datasets d where {\u03b8 d } is the collection of parameters across all datasets. CATCH calculates S({\u03b8 d }), or the final probe set, by minimizing a loss function over {\u03b8 d } while ensuring that the number of probes in S({\u03b8 d }) falls within the specified number of oligonucleotides (Fig. 1a) .",

Our approach treats this problem as an instance of the well-studied set cover problem 25, 26 , the solution to which is s(d, \u03b8 d ) ( Fig. 1a and Methods).

            "text": "CATCH's framework offers considerable flexibility in designing probes for various applications. For example, a user can customize the model of hybridization that CATCH uses to determine whether a candidate probe will hybridize to and capture a particular target sequence. Also, a user can design probe sets for capturing only a specified fraction of each target genome and, relatedly, for targeting regions of the genome that distinguish similar but distinct subtypes. CATCH also offers an option to blacklist sequences, for example, highly abundant ribosomal RNA sequences, so that output probes are unlikely to capture them. CATCH can use locality-sensitive hashing 27, 28 , if desired, to reduce the number of candidate probes that are explored, improving runtime and memory usage on especially large numbers of input sequences. We implemented CATCH in a Python package that is publicly available at https://github.com/ broadinstitute/catch. Probe sets to capture viral diversity. We used CATCH to design a probe set that targets all viral species reported to infect humans (V ALL ), which could be used to achieve more sensitive metagenomic sequencing of viruses from human samples. V ALL encompasses 356 species (86 genera, 31 families), and we designed it using genomes available from NCBI GenBank 29, 30 (Supplementary Table 1 ). We constrained the number of probes to 350,000, significantly fewer than the number used in studies with comparable goals 18, 19 , reducing the cost of synthesizing probes that target diversity across hundreds of viral species. The design output by CATCH contained 349,998 probes (Fig. 1c) . This design represents comprehensive coverage of the input sequence diversity under conservative choices of parameter values, for example, tolerating few mismatches between probe and target sequences (Fig. 1d) . To compare the performance of V ALL against probe sets with lower complexity, we separately designed three focused probe sets for commonly co-circulating viral infections: measles and mumps viruses (V MM ; 6,219 probes), Zika and chikungunya viruses (V ZC ; 6,171 probes), and a panel of 23 species (16 genera, 12 families) circulating in West Africa (V WAFR ; 44,995 probes) (Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 1) .",

To evaluate the enrichment efficiency of V ALL , we prepared sequencing libraries from 30 patient and environmental samples containing at least one of eight different viruses: dengue virus (DENV), GB virus C (GBV-C), hepatitis C virus (HCV), HIV-1, influenza A virus (IAV), Lassa virus (LASV), mumps virus (MuV), and Zika virus (ZIKV) (Supplementary Table 2 ). These eight viruses together reflect a range of typical viral titers in biological samples, including ones that have extremely low levels, such as ZIKV 6, 7 . The samples encompass a range of source materials: plasma, serum, buccal swabs, urine, avian swabs, and mosquito pools. We performed capture on these libraries and sequenced them both before and after capture. To compare enrichment of viral content across sequencing runs, we downsampled raw read data from each sample to the same number of reads (200,000) before further analysis. Downsampling to correct for differences in sequencing depth, rather than the more common use of a normalized count such as reads per million, is useful for two reasons. First, it allows us to compare our ability to assemble genomes (for example, due to capture) in samples that were sequenced to different depths. Second, downsampling helps to correct for differences in sequencing depth in the presence of a high frequency of PCR duplicate reads (Methods), as observed in captured libraries. We removed duplicate reads during analyses so that we could measure enrichment of viral information (that is, unique viral content) rather than measure an artifactual enrichment arising from PCR amplification.",

For samples that had incomplete genome assemblies (< 90%) before capture, we found that application of V ALL allowed us to assemble a greater fraction of the genome in all cases (Fig. 2c) . Importantly, of the 14 samples from which we were unable to assemble any contig before capture, we were able to assemble 11 at least partial genomes (> 50%) using V ALL , of which 4 were complete genomes (> 90%). Many of the viruses we tested, such as HCV and HIV-1, are known to have high within-species diversity, yet the Then it determines a profile of where each candidate probe will hybridize (the genomes and regions within them) under a model with parameters \u03b8 d (see Supplementary Fig. 1b for details). Using these coverage profiles, it approximates the smallest collection of probes that fully captures all input genomes (described in the text as s(d, \u03b8 d )). Given a constraint on the total number of probes (N) and a loss function over \u03b8 d , it searches for the optimal \u03b8 d for all d. b, Number of probes required to fully capture increasing numbers of HCV genomes. Approaches shown are simple tiling (gray), a clustering-based approach at two levels of stringency (red), and CATCH with three choices of parameter values specifying varying levels of stringency (blue). See Supplementary Note 2 for details regarding parameter choices. Previous approaches for targeting viral diversity use clustering in probe set design. The shaded regions around each line are 95% pointwise confidence bands calculated across randomly sampled input genomes. c, Number of probes designed by CATCH for each dataset (of 296 datasets in total) among all 349,998 probes in the V ALL probe set.

The label and size of each bubble indicate the number of datasets that were assigned a particular combination of values. Species included in our sample testing are labeled in black, and outlier species not included in our testing are in gray. In general, more diverse viruses (for example, HCV and HIV-1) are assigned more relaxed parameter values (here, high values) than less diverse viruses, but still require a relatively large number of probes in the design to cover known diversity (see c).

We also explored the impact of capture on the complete metagenomic diversity within each sample. Metagenomic sequencing generates reads from the host genome as well as background contaminants 32 , and capture should reduce the abundance of these taxa. Following capture with V ALL , the fraction of sequence classified as human decreased in patient samples while viral species with a wide range of pre-capture abundances were strongly enriched (Fig. 2d) . Moreover, we observed a reduction in the overall number of species detected after capture ( Supplementary Fig. 6a ), suggesting that capture indeed reduces non-targeted taxa. Lastly, analysis of these metagenomic data identified a number of other enriched viral species present in these samples (Supplementary Table 4 ). For example, one HIV-1 sample showed strong evidence of HCV co-infection, an observation consistent with clinical PCR testing. At each position across a genome, the post-capture read depth is divided by the pre-capture depth, and the plotted curve is the empirical cumulative distribution of the log of these fold-change values.

We saw the least enrichment in segment 6 (N), which had the least identity between probe sequence and the H4N4 sequence, as we did not include any sequences of the N4 subtypes in the probe designs. Interestingly, V ALL did show limited positive enrichment of segment 6, as well as of segment 4 (H); these enrichments were lower than those of the less divergent segments. But this was not the case for segment 4 when using V WAFR , suggesting a greater target affinity of V WAFR capture when there is some degree of divergence between probes and target sequence (Fig. 3b) , potentially due to this probe set's longer, ssRNA probes. For both probe sets, we observed no clear inter-segment differences in enrichment across the remaining segments, whose sequences have high identity with probe sequences (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 9 ).

At equivalent pre-and post-capture sequencing depths (200,000 reads), use of V ALL improved our ability to detect and assemble LASV. Capture considerably increased the amount of unique LASV material detected in all 23 samples (in 4 samples, by more than 100\u00d7 ), and in 7 samples it enabled detection when there were no LASV reads pre-capture (Supplementary Fig.  10a and Supplementary Table 7 ). This in turn improved genome assembly. Whereas pre-capture we could not assemble any portion of a genome in 22 samples (in the remaining sample, 2% of a genome could be assembled) at this depth, following use of V ALL we could assemble a partial genome in 22 of the 23 samples ( Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 10b) ; most were small portions of a genome, although in 7 samples we assembled > 50% of a genome. Assembly results with V ALL were comparable without downsampling ( Supplementary Fig. 10c ), likely because we saturated unique content with V ALL even at low sequencing depths ( Supplementary Fig.  7b,c) . These results illustrate how V ALL can be used to improve viral detection and genome assembly in an outbreak, especially at the low sequencing depths that may be desired or required in these settings.",

Also, quantifying the sensitivity and specificity of capture with comprehensive probe sets is challenging-as it is for metagenomic sequencing more broadly-owing to the need to obtain viral genomes for the hundreds of targeted species and the risk of false positives from components of sequencing and classification that are unrelated to capture (for example, contamination in sample processing or read misclassifications). Targeted amplicon approaches may be faster and more sensitive 7 for sequencing ultra-low-titer samples, but the suitability of these approaches is limited by genome size, sequence heterogeneity, and the need for prior knowledge of the target species 1, 43, 44 . Similarly, for molecular diagnostics of particular pathogens, many commonly used assays such as qRT-PCR and rapid antigen tests are likely to be faster and less expensive than metagenomic sequencing. Capture does increase the preparation cost and time per sample as compared to unbiased metagenomic sequencing, but this is offset by reduced sequencing costs through increased sample pooling and/or lower-depth sequencing 1 (Supplementary Table 9 ).",

Beyond microbes, CATCH could benefit studies in other areas that use capture-based approaches, such as the detection of previously characterized fetal and tumor DNA from cell-free material 49,50 , in which known targets of interest may represent a small fraction of all material and for which it may be useful to rapidly design new probe sets for enrichment as novel targets are discovered.

We first describe how CATCH determines a probe set that covers input sequences under some selection of parameters. That is, the input is a collection of (unaligned) sequences d and parameters \u03b8 d describing hybridization, and the goal is to compute a set of probes s(d, \u03b8 d ). For example, d commonly encompasses the strain diversity of one or more species and \u03b8 d includes the number of mismatches that we should tolerate when determining whether a probe hybridizes to a sequence. CATCH produces a set of candidate probes from the input sequences in d by stepping along them according to a specified stride (Fig. 1a) . Optionally, CATCH uses locality-sensitive hashing 27, 28 (LSH) to reduce the number of candidate probes, which is particularly useful when the input is a large number of highly similar sequences. CATCH supports two LSH families: one under Hamming distance 27 and another using the MinHash technique 28, 51 , which has been used in metagenomic applications 52, 53 . It detects near-duplicate candidate probes by performing approximate near-neighbor search 28 using a specified family and distance threshold. CATCH constructs hash tables containing the candidate probes and then queries each (in descending order of multiplicity) to find and collapse near-duplicates. Because LSH reduces the space of candidate probes, it may remove candidate probes that would otherwise be selected in the steps described below, thereby increasing the size of the output probe set. Use of LSH to reduce the number of candidate probes is optional in our implementation of CATCH; we did not use it to produce the probe sets in this work. The approach of detecting near-duplicates among probes (and subsequently mapping them onto sequences, described below) bears some similarity to the use of P clouds for clustering related oligonucleotides to identify diverse repetitive regions in the human genome 54, 55 .",

We excluded samples where one or more conditions had fewer than 100,000 raw reads for reasons of comparability. Excluded samples are highlighted in red in Supplementary Table 3 .",

We assembled a genome of this sample both pre-capture and following capture with V ALL to verify concordance; we used the V ALL sequence for further analysis here because it was more complete. We aligned depleted reads to this genome as described above (with BWA using the 'align_and_plot_coverage' function of viral-ngs and the following parameters: '-m 50000 --excludeDuplicates --aligner_ options \"-k 12 -B 2 -O 3\" --minScoreToFilter 60'). For a window in the genome, we calculated the fold change in depth to be the fold change of the mean depth post-capture against the mean depth pre-capture within the window. Here we used windows of length 150 nt, sliding with a stride of 25 nt. We aligned all probe sequences in V ALL and V WAFR designs to this genome using BWA-MEM 71 with the following options: '-a -M -k 8 -A 1 -B 1 -O 2 -E 1 -L 2 -T 20'; these sensitive parameters should account for most possible hybridizations and include a low softclipping penalty to allow us to model a portion of a probe hybridizing to a target while the remainder hangs off. We counted the number of bases that matched between a probe and target sequence using each alignment's MD tag (this does not count soft-clipped ends) and defined the identity between a probe and target sequence to be this number of matching bases divided by the probe length. We defined the identity between probes and a window of the target genome as follows: we considered all mapped probe sequences that had at least half their alignment within the window and took the mean of the top 25% of identity values between these probes and the target sequence. In Fig. 3b , we plot a point for each window. We did this separately with probes from the V ALL and V WAFR designs.",

We ran kraken through viral-ngs and separately ran kraken-filter with a threshold of 0.1 for classification. For samples where two independent libraries had been prepared and used for V ALL and V WAFR , or where the same pre-capture library had been sequenced more than once, we merged the raw sequence files before downsampling. To account for laboratory contaminants, we also ran kraken on water controls; we first merged all water controls together and classified reads as described above. We evaluated the presence and enrichment of viral and other taxa using the cumulative species-level counts, as above. To do so, we calculated two measures: abundance, which was calculated by dividing pre-capture read counts for each species by counts in pooled water controls, and enrichment, which was calculated by dividing post-capture read counts for each species by pre-capture read counts in the same sample. For our uncharacterized mosquito pools and human plasma samples from Nigeria and Sierra Leone, after capture with V ALL we searched for viral species with more than ten matched reads and a read count greater than twofold higher than in the pooled water control after capture with V ALL .

The probe set pooled across datasets is then S({\u03b8 d }*). It is possible that CATCH cannot find a choice of {\u03b8 d } such that |S({\u03b8 d })| \u2264 N. This might be the case, for example, if the grid of \u03b8 d values over which a user precomputes s(d, \u03b8 d ) has too small a range to satisfy the constraint. That is, one or more of the parameter values may need to be relaxed (across one or more datasets) to obtain \u2264 N probes. When this happens, our implementation of CATCH raises an error and suggests that the user provide less stringent choices of parameter values. Design of viral probe sets presented here.

In addition, some samples from Kenema Government Hospital and Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital were collected under waivers of consent to facilitate rapid public health response during the Ebola outbreak and also because the research involved no more than minimal risk to the subjects. The Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology IRBs, as well as the Office of Research Subject Protection at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, provided approval for sequencing and secondary analysis of samples collected by the aforementioned institutions.For all clinical and environmental samples, including samples from the 2018 Lassa outbreak, we extracted RNA using the Qiagen QIAamp viral mini kit, except in cases where samples were provided for secondary use as extracted RNA directly from the source or following passage. Extractions were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions from 140 \u03bc l of biological material inactivated in 560 \u03bc l of buffer AVL.Mock co-infection samples were generated by spiking equal volumes of RNA isolated from 2, 4, 6, or 8 viral seed stocks (dengue virus, Ebola virus, influenza A virus, Lassa virus, Marburg virus, measles virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and Nipah virus) into RNA isolated from the plasma of a healthy human donor, purchased from Research Blood Components. Ebola virus dilution series were generated by adding 1 to 10 6 copies of Ebola virus (Makona) to 30 ng or 300 ng of human K562 RNA. All dilutions were prepared and sequenced in duplicate. For samples where the microbial content was uncharacterized-26 mosquito pools from the United States, human plasma from 25 individuals with acute non-Lassa virus fevers from Nigeria, and human plasma from 25 individuals with suspected Lassa and Ebola virus infections from Sierra Leone-we created sample pools by combining equal volumes of extracted RNA for five samples per pool (one mosquito pool contained six), resulting in 15 final pools (5 mosquito, 5 Nigeria, and 5 Sierra Leone).",
