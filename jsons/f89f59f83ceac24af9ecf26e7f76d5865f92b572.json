He then spent two years in the USA, mostly at Harvard with John Murphy and Alwin Pappenheimer working on a new diphtheria vaccine based on a non-toxic mutant of diphtheria toxin which has since become the basis for conjugate vaccines against haemophilus, meningococcus, and pneumococcal infections, before returning to the Sclavo Research Center where he developed an acellular vaccine based on a mutant pertussis toxin. With many achievements in vaccine development to his credit, he is now Global Head of Vaccines Research and Development for Novartis Vaccines in Siena, and has most recently pioneered reverse vaccinology, in which the genome of the pathogen is screened for candidate antigenic and immunogenic vaccine components. We spoke to him about the potential for outbreaks of the kind we are now seeing with Ebolavirus in West Africa, and what can be done to prevent them.",

I remember for example when SARS came in 2003/2004 we made a vaccine pretty quickly and brought it to the stage where it was ready to go to phase 1, but when we got to phase 1 the disease had gone away, there was no interest, no incentive to bring it even to phase 1, so we dropped it. For Ebola I think that the technology to make a vaccine has been there for many years, but nobody wanted to invest in it because there was no market, no demand.",

I hope that this humanitarian and health disaster is going to help us to become a little bit smarter in planning the future. I see these emerging infectious diseases as a constant threat. They pose a risk, just as in other areas we have a risk of earthquakes, we have a risk when we drive a car of car accidents, when we buy a house there is a risk of burning the house, and so on -and for all of those risks we prepare ahead of time. We have insurance for cars or we have insurance for houses and we build buildings that are earthquake-resistant. It looks as though the only place where we are not able to make investments ahead of time is health -we always have to wait for the disaster to happen and then we rush and usually with the vaccine we come too late and when the disease is no longer there then everyone forgets and we go from one disaster to another.",

Under very accelerated circumstances, like those we have now for Ebola, you can take advantage of previous studies that have been done and try to rush the development of the vaccine, but we do take risks with safety and efficacy when we accelerate so much, so I think we will be wise to develop those vaccines ahead of time.",

I believe that it is extremely unlikely. This virus has been there for a long time in the wild in Africa and it has never done it. It has had many opportunities to do it. I don't think that a small exposure to mankind right now is going to do it and the preliminary data from the genetics and genomics of the virus show very good stability so I don't think this is a risk in the short term.",

It will not be in the news and there will be other news about another emerging infection and we will rush into the new one, and instead of doing that I think it would be nice to be able to plan ahead of time. I think we have technologies today by which we could prepare multiple vaccine platforms that could be tested for safety and efficacy against multiple diseases and where you could plug in an antigen from a new emerging infection quickly. We already effectively have this for influenza virus, for which as the virus mutates each year we just plug in the most prevalent haemagglutinin variants to the existing vaccine platform. If the regulatory authorities could approve platforms suitable for use against other pathogensthus already of proven safety and efficacywe could have a way of being as ready as possible for unexpected events.",
