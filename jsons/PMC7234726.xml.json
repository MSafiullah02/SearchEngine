In a 2017 BMJ article, Dr. Kyle Sue demonstrated the effect of sex hormones, estrogen and testosterone, on immune system response and engagement, resulting in a less robust immunologic response in males and subsequent increased morbidity and mortality from viral respiratory illnesses.6 In addition, the X chromosome carries the largest number of immune-related genes in the human genome, perhaps also contributing to female\u2019s superior immune response (as well as a female preponderance in autoimmune diseases).7",

In general, the prevalence of PTSD has been shown to be substantially higher in women.16 This has been re-substantiated in the setting of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China, where women scored significantly higher on the PCL-5 (DSM-5 self-report measure for PTSD) than men, including higher rates of re-experiencing and negative alterations in cognition or mood.17 Early recognition and effective treatment can ameliorate the burden of PTSD on both the individual and society, particularly for women who have been shown to have a modest advantage with regard to treatment response.18",
