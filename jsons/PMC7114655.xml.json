            "text": "Along with fish demands increase, it is critical to reduce losses from viral diseases that economically devastate the aquaculture industry (Balmer et al., 2017). Considered as one of the most serious viral threats for cyprinids, spring viraemia of carp (SVC) has caused large-scale deaths and serious economic losses in the aquaculture industry in the past decades (Ashraf et al., 2016). The causative agent of SVC is spring viraemia of carp virus (SVCV) which is classified as a member of the Rhabdoviridae family (Ashraf et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2019). SVCV is an enveloped, bullet-shaped RNA virus encoding a negative-sense, ssRNA genome. The virus has widely spread over Europe, Asia, North America and South America ever since its first detection in 1971 (Fijan, 1972; Dikkeboom et al., 2004; Garver et al., 2007). Young fish are especially susceptible to SVCV with up to 90% mortality (Baudouy et al., 1980; Ashraf et al., 2016). Given that SVC causes high mortality among cyprinids and large economic losses in aquaculture, it is imperative to develop effective measures to control the outbreaks of SVC.",

New DNA vaccines have been developed against SVCV and are evoking protection even after oral application (Emmenegger and Kurath, 2008; Cui et al., 2015; Embregts et al., 2019). However, there is no commercial vaccine currently available for the disease. In addition, some researches have been conducted to develop anti-SVCV drugs. Previous studies reported that several natural products and their derivatives showed a good anti-SVCV potential (Chen et al., 2018a, b; Liu et al., 2017, 2018; Liu et al., 2019; Shen et al., 2018a, b; Shen et al., 2019).

These metabolites mediate important host\u2013microbe and microbe\u2013microbe interactions and show plentiful biological activities (Wang et al., 2018). For instance, toxin oosporein from pathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana interacted with gut microbiota to accelerate mosquito mortality (Wei et al., 2017). Additionally, poly-g-glutamic acid, a polypeptide secreted by Bacillus sp. played an antiviral role on SARS coronavirus and hepatitis C virus (Lee et al., 2013). Anisomycin (Ani), a small bioactive drug produced by Streptomyces griseolus, had been verified to possess antiprotozoal and antiviral activities (Ramabhadran and Thach, 1980; Tang et al., 2012). Reportedly, Ani could inhibit the replication of encephalomyocarditis virus (Ramabhadran and Thach, 1980). However, its application to treat viral diseases in aquaculture has not yet been investigated.",

As a model organism, adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) are easily susceptible to SVCV. Thus it is to be considered as an ideal experimental model for studying the antiviral effect of Ani on SVCV in vivo.

However, the use of vaccine in aquaculture is still restricted due to the handling stress on fish, as well as high laboring and production costs (Life, 2008). In addition, effective drugs for controlling SVCV in aquaculture is still scarce up to now (Ashraf et al., 2016; Shen et al., 2019).

            "text": "Up to now, only a few studies have provided valuable insights into discovering antiviral agents against SVCV. Our recent studies reported that four synthesized coumarins inhibited SVCV with IC50 2,2, 3.2, 0.6 and 2.4 mg/L (Liu et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2018b; Shen et al., 2018b). In addition, arctigenin (IC50 = 0.29 mg/L) and its two derivatives (IC50 = 0.08 and 0.10 mg/L) were found with anti-SVCV activities (Chen et al., 2018a; Shen et al., 2018a). As natural products, bavachin and saikosaponin D showed efficient inhibition on SVCV infection with IC50 0.46 and 0.21 mg/L (Chen et al., 2018a; Shen et al., 2019). In the present study, the IC50 of Ani on SVCV G mRNA expression is only 21.79 nM (0.06 mg/L). Ani is more effective to inhibit SVCV infection in EPC cells, compared with the previously reported compounds. Previous study reported that Ani significantly inhibited the proliferation of T cells in mice (Xing et al., 2008), which indicated that Ani had a suppressive effect on specific cellular immunity. Several immunosuppressive agents have also been confirmed to possess antiviral activities. For instance, dexamethasone, a classic immunosuppressive agent, has been reported with antiviral activity against Human immunode\ufb01ciency virus and Parainfluenza virus (Bourinbaiar and Leehuang, 1995; Liliana et al., 2003). Rapamycin, the third-generation immunosuppressive agent, was found with antiviral activity against infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus, rift valley fever virus and so on (Bell et al., 2017; Ko et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2017). In addition, these immunosuppressive agents usually possess anti-inflammatory activity and can improve pathological features (Attur et al., 2000; Liliana et al., 2003; Song et al., 2015). Here, we speculated that the suppressive effect of Ani on specific cellular immunity might induce the anti-inflammatory activity and contribute to its protective effect on SVCV-infected zebrafish, which needs further studies.",

            "text": "Due to the highly efficient inhibition of SVCV replication mediated by Ani in vitro, we further explored whether Ani was also effective to SVCV infection in vivo. Based on the results of previous studies which performed an efficacy comparison between bath infection and intraperitoneal injection of viral infection (Sanders et al., 2003; Encinas et al., 2013), we chose the intraperitoneal injection as the way of SVCV infection. Our previous study indicated that SVCV replicated quickly in zebrafish within 2th and 5th dpi (Shen et al., 2018b). In accordance with this study, zebrafish died with a high speed within 3th and 5th dpi, which suggested SVCV replication sharply expanded in zebrafish within a short period. It should be noted that Ani could inhibit SVCV replication at 4th dpi. This indicated that Ani reduced SVCV replication in fish body to delay virus infection at the peak of virus replication. Thus, Ani as an antiviral agent showed an effective protection on SVCV-infected zebrafish. Take the example of our recently synthesized coumarin derivatives, statistics showed that they increased the survival rates of zebrafish by 17.5 and 22.5% and inhibited the G mRNA expression by about 50% in kidney and spleen at the first four days (Shen et al., 2018b; Liu et al., 2019). Compared with these two coumarin derivatives, Ani with an inhibitory percentage of >60% was more effective in the treatment of SVCV infection in zebrafish. Given the above, Ani has been identified with antiviral activity against SVCV in vivo and can be an alternative anti-SVCV agent in aquaculture.",
