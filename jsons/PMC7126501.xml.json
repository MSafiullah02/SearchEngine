All consecutive patients with CAAAs or TAAAs undergoing endovascular repair with custom-made fenestrated Zenith devices (Cook Medical, Bloomington, Ind) or PMSGs between January 2012 and November 2017 were included. CAAAs included juxtarenal and suprarenal aneurysms. Because PMSGs were designed on a Cook platform and fenestrated Anaconda (Vascutek/Terumo Aortic, Inchinnan, Scotland, United Kingdom) and Ventana (Endologix, Irvine, Calif) devices were limited to juxtarenal and pararenal aneurysms, patients treated with the fenestrated Anaconda device (n = 9) or the Ventana (n = 9) during the study period were excluded. TAAAs were classified according to the modified Crawford classification. Patients were considered for open, hybrid, or endovascular repair in a multidisciplinary weekly meeting. Patients were precluded from open or hybrid repair following a series of criteria including the patient's performance status (American Society of Anesthesiologists [ASA] class and metabolic equivalent of task score) and medical history (cardiac, renal, and pulmonary status). Indications for a PMSG were painful aneurysms, rapidly enlarging >70-mm aneurysms, saccular aneurysms, type I endoleaks after previous endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) associated with >70-mm aneurysms, threatening intramural hematoma, and visceral patch false aneurysm after TAAA open repair. Rapidly enlarging aneurysms were defined as growth >5 mm within 6 months. All patients underwent computed tomography (CT) scan preoperatively and within 1 month after the operation. The study was in agreement with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, and informed consent was obtained from all patients. According to our center's local regulations and French prevailing legislation (article L1121-1, Code de Sant\u00e9 Publique), Institutional Review Board approval was not required for this retrospective study. In consenting of patients, potential risks and benefits of PMSGs and CMSGs were discussed in detail. The theoretical increased risk of infection associated with PMSGs, the lack of standardization, and the lack of midterm and long-term data were clearly explained.",

More recently, the stent graft of choice was changed to Cook dissection endografts, which can be provided with an 8-mm tapering. A Valiant closed web device (Medtronic, Santa Rosa, Calif) was used in one case. Parallel grafts were used in combination with fenestrations in a few patients with difficult anatomies (ie, excessive aortic angulation at the visceral level, presence of a previous aortic stent graft with suprarenal bare-metal stents, or target vessel ostia too close together) for which successful target vessel cannulation through a fenestration was deemed unpredictable. Detailed planning and sizing steps, device preparation, and stent graft implantation were described in a previous publication from our group.12 For target vessel stenting, Advanta V12 balloon-expandable covered stents (Maquet, Rastatt, Germany) were used in both groups as bridging stents from 2012 to early 2015. Each stent was flared using Mustang 10-mm \u00d7 2-cm or 12-mm \u00d7 2-cm balloons (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, Mass). After 2015, we began to use LifeStream (Bard, Tempe, Ariz) and BeGraft (Bentley Innomed GmbH, Hechingen, Germany) covered stents along with V12 as bridging stents.",

The patients presenting with type I endoleak after EVAR had large aneurysms (respectively, 70 mm and 85 mm) and were considered to have a high risk of rupture. Another 77-year-old patient was admitted for an intramural hematoma of the thoracoabdominal aorta that was first treated medically. Persistent pain, presence of left pleural effusion, and onset of multiple ulcer-like projections on a control CT scan performed 3 days later led to emergent cervical debranching and thoracic graft stenting (Fig, A). One week after the operation, the patient had persisting abdominal pain. Another control CT scan showed growing ulcer-like projections at the abdominal level (Fig, B and C), which led to an emergent PMSG procedure (Fig, D-F). The patient with the visceral patch false aneurysm after open repair of a type IV TAAA performed 5 years earlier presented with a contained rupture that we considered emergent to treat. In the PMSG group, five patients presenting with large and asymptomatic TAAAs underwent a staged procedure. In four cases, an additional thoracic fenestration was created for temporary sac perfusion, which was successfully closed 2 to 4 weeks after PMSG implantation. No neurologic event was recorded during these planned reinterventions. One elderly patient with a painful TAAA involving the distal segment of the arch underwent a two-stage procedure. During the first stage, she underwent cervical debranching and stent grafting of the arch and thoracic aorta (with, respectively, Relay NBS [Vascutek/Terumo Aortic] and Cook Alpha). During the second stage 7 days later, the PMSG was deployed. Although she had thoracic pain, we thought she was too frail to cope with a long one-stage procedure.",

For asymptomatic large aneurysms, fenestrations are created in custom-made devices, which can be provided within 5 days with specific proximal and distal diameters, with a specific level of tapering, and without proximal barbs. When a proximal thoracic component is needed, distances are calculated to obtain a minimum of three stents of overlap with the fenestrated device (60-80 mm). For symptomatic aneurysms, we now use Zenith dissection stent grafts, which can be delivered within 24 hours with straight, 4-mm tapering, or 8-mm tapering designs. Devices with 8-mm tapering were particularly useful in painful juxtarenal and suprarenal aneurysms. The two proximal stents ensured good proximal sealing, whereas the tapering on the third stent allowed adequate fenestration positioning in the visceral aorta. However, because we did not use scallops, juxtarenal aneurysms were mainly treated with four-fenestration stent grafts, which could be considered unnecessary with custom-made fenestrated devices. Graft modifications for four fenestrations took us approximately 2 hours, which is too long in the setting of ruptured unstable aneurysms. Clearly, PMSG was not a good technique for ruptures. We also found that fenestration positioning and adequate graft deployment were difficult to predict in case of posterior takeoff of renal arteries, especially in small aortic diameters, where reducing ties have the effect of pulling fenestrations even more posteriorly. We now tend to avoid fenestrations when the left and right renal ostia are positioned between 4:30 and 6:00 and between 6:00 and 7:30, respectively.",
