She contacted her husband who visited the boxing stadium where the COVID-19 outbreak occurred and was diagnosed with COVID-19 infection 2 days before she developed symptoms. Her vital signs were normal without fever and physical examination was unremarkable. Nasopharyngeal and throat swabs were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays. Her investigations including complete blood count, renal function, serum electrolyte, liver function and urinalysis were within normal limits. Chest radiograph did not reveal any obvious active cardiopulmonary lesion. Rapid tests for influenza viruses and respiratory syncytial virus were negative.",

Nasopharyngeal and throat swab were conducted every two days. Her past antenatal history and ultrasonography from another hospital were unremarkable and amniocentesis was done one week before this admission due to high risk of aneuploidy by maternal age. Karyotype results which reported on the 10th day of admission demonstrated 47;XY,+21 and was diagnosed as fetal Down syndrome. Most published studies of COVID-19 in pregnancy are reported in the third trimester [1] . Currently, only two briefed cases of mild infection in the late second trimester [2] and one case of miscarriage in the early second trimester [3] were reported. In our report, the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in this early second trimester pregnancy are indifferent from reports of non-pregnant patients [4] . There are no obvious immediate effects to the fetus after prolonged maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection for three weeks in the second trimester which demonstrated by positive fetal heartbeat and unchanged ultrasonographic result. Pregnancyrelated adverse events did not occur during infection of this patient such as premature labor or premature rupture of membrane. Therefore, we observed that pregnancy did not aggravate COVID-19 and the prolonged infection did not cause pregnancy complications in this patient J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f as well. To eradicate infection, specific treatment was not essential in pregnant patients with mild symptoms similarly to non-pregnant patients with only addition of fetal monitoring.",
