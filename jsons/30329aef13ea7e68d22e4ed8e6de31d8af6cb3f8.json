This is associated with increased risk of acquiring fungal opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients which account for high morbidity and mortality rates, if left untreated. The conventional antifungal drugs to treat fungal diseases (mycoses) are increasingly becoming inadequate due to observed varied susceptibility of fungi and their recurrent resistance. RNA interference (RNAi), sequencespecific gene silencing, is emerging as a promising new therapeutic approach. This chapter discusses various aspects of RNAi, viz., the fundamental RNAi machinery present in fungi, in silico siRNA features, designing guidelines and tools, siRNA delivery, and validation of gene knockdown for therapeutics against mycoses. Target gene identification is a crucial step in designing of gene-specific siRNA in addition to efficient delivery strategies to bring about effective inhibition of fungi. Subsequently, designed siRNA can be delivered effectively in vitro either by soaking fungi with siRNA or by transforming inverted repeat transgene containing plasmid into fungi, which ultimately generates siRNA(s). Finally, fungal inhibition can be verified at the RNA and protein levels by blotting techniques, fluorescence imaging, and biochemical assays. Despite challenges, several such in vitro studies have spawned optimism around RNAi as a revolutionary new class of therapeutics against mycoses. But, pharmacokinetic parameters need to be evaluated from in vivo studies and clinical trials to recognize RNAi as a novel treatment approach for mycoses.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The last two decades have seen a rising trend in the immunocompromised patients (Richardson 1991; Krcmery 1996; Warnock and Richardson 1991; Ribes et al. 2000) , who are at a heightened risk for \"opportunistic\" fungal infections (mycoses). The fungal infections can affect any part of the body and cause superficial mycoses (affecting only the outermost layers of the skin and hair), cutaneous mycoses (extending deeper into the layers of the skin, hair, and nail), subcutaneous mycoses (involve the dermis, subcutaneous tissues, muscle, and fascia), or systemic mycoses (dissemination in the body). The fungal diseases (listed in Table 12 .1) are classified according to the three important phyla of the fungal taxonomy -Ascomycetes, Basidiomycetes, and Zygomycetes. These diseases turn out to be severe if disseminated, which is common in the immunosuppressed. Candidiasis is one of the highly frequent fungal infections in 90% of untreated, advanced HIV cases suffering from oropharyngeal candidiasis according to World Health Organization (WHO) 2010 statistics. Another study reported overall mortality rate of approximately 80% for zygomycosis (Ribes et al. 2000) and 80-90% in invasive aspergillosis of high-risk leukemia patients and allogeneic bone marrow transplant patients (Chamilos and Kontoyiannis 2005) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 80, "end": 97, "text": "(Richardson 1991;", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 98, "end": 111, "text": "Krcmery 1996;", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 112, "end": 140, "text": "Warnock and Richardson 1991;", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 141, "end": 159, "text": "Ribes et al. 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1149, "end": 1168, "text": "(Ribes et al. 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1284, "end": 1316, "text": "(Chamilos and Kontoyiannis 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 631, "end": 639, "text": "Table 12", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The existing fungal treatments require parallel approaches involving surgical intervention and antifungal therapy (Ribes et al. 2000) .

These drugs have drawbacks such as nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity as exhibited by liposomal amphotericin B, narrow spectrum of activity as shown by fluconazole, and itraconazole causes problems with absorption (Pauw and Picazo 2008) . Moreover, the fungi are acquiring resistance recurrently against novel antifungal agents (Rogers 2008) either due to defects in drug import and efflux of drugs, variations in intracellular drug processing, alterations in the enzymes of a target-specific biosynthetic pathway, or its competitive inhibition (Chamilos and Kontoyiannis 2005; Bhanderi et al. 2009 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 114, "end": 133, "text": "(Ribes et al. 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 381, "end": 404, "text": "(Mukherjee et al. 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 500, "end": 519, "text": "(Ribes et al. 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 735, "end": 757, "text": "(Pauw and Picazo 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 849, "end": 862, "text": "(Rogers 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 1066, "end": 1098, "text": "(Chamilos and Kontoyiannis 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1099, "end": 1119, "text": "Bhanderi et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The existing treatments are not effective due to varied susceptibility of fungi toward the drugs; hence, newer safe and effective therapeutic interventions are desired. There have been reports of the use of gene therapy, antisense oligonucleotides, ribozymes, DNAzymes, and RNAi therapy. RNAi scores several benefits over other techniques, for instance, its effective delivery into various organs at low concentrations, thereby increasing safety, its cost-effectiveness as compared to protein/enzymes, and its non-immunogenicity bypassing the interferon pathway (Ruddon 2007 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 562, "end": 574, "text": "(Ruddon 2007", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Gene cosuppression (RNAi-type phenomenon), which is more commonly known as \"quelling\" in fungi, was first discovered in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa by Romano and Macino (1992) . The significant aspect of RNAi was established in 1998 when Fire and Mello found out that dsRNA is 10-100 times more effective in triggering silencing as compared to ssRNA in Caenorhabditis elegans (Fire et al. 1998 ) for which they shared the Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology in 2006. RNAi naturally occurring \"sequence-specific gene silencing\" phenomenon and evolutionarily highly conserved mechanism are well developed in eukaryotic organisms, which is induced by double-stranded small noncoding RNA (dsRNA). These RNA-mediated gene silencing pathways have been comparatively thoroughly known and established in plant and animal system and are widely investigated in a variety of fungi, few of them are reported on opportunistic pathogenic fungi in human. The RNAi machinery in fungi shares similar mechanistic principles with other organisms where RNAi has been discovered which consists of dsRNA precursors, Dicer enzyme, RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex), and the target mRNA. The dsRNA is processed into short interfering RNA (siRNA) by two steps -the initiator step and the effector step. In the initiator step, the dsRNA is cleaved by the enzyme Dicer of the RNase III family (Jinek and Doudna 2009 ) into specific lengths of 21-25 nucleotides. In the effector step, the siRNA must segregate into \"competent\" single strands (the guide strands) which are guided through a ribonucleotide protein complex called the RISC (Siomi and Siomi 2009 ), a member of the Argonaute family of proteins (Song et al. 2004a, b; Leuschner et al. 2006; Fulci and Macino 2007) . Both Dicer and RISC complex require ATP for energy. The Argonaute has a N-terminal domain, PAZ domain, a middle domain, and a PIWI domain. It is the \"guide strand\" which is incorporated into RISC; the non-incorporated strand known as the \"passenger strand\" is also crucial for proper target mRNA cleavage. Until the passenger strand is not cleaved at ten nucleotides from the 5 0 phosphate of the guide strand, target mRNA cleavage is severely impaired (Leuschner et al. 2006) . The cleaved target mRNA is utilized by RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) generating more dsRNA that is further recognized and cleaved by Dicer to increase the number of siRNA molecules (Schepers 2005). Genes responsible for RNAi have been discovered in fungi such as qde-1 (quelling deficient-1) which was the first RNAi gene discovered in N. crassa which encodes a cellular RdRp. Simultaneously, qde-2 was cloned and found out to encode Argonaute protein. Further, partially redundant Dicer proteins DCL-1 (Dicer-like-1) and DCL-2 have been characterized from N. crassa by reverse genetics (Li et al. 2010) . So far, RNAi mechanism has not been observed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida guilliermondii, C. lusitaniae, C. tropicalis, and Ustilago maydis ; M\u00fcnsterk\u20ac otter and Mannhaupt 2008). In S.cerevisiae, it has been attributed to the absence of conserved components like Dicer-like RNases, Argonaute or PIWI-like components, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. However, RNAi was very recently discovered in S. castellii, which is closely related to S.cerevisiae, and also in C. albicans, a common human pathogen, by David P. Bartel's lab [22] (Drinnenberg et al. 2009 ). They found out that these species with noncanonical Dicer activity have RNase III domain containing gene to generate siRNA(s). This gene is orthologous to RNase III domains of other Argonaute-containing budding yeasts and is mostly enriched in long inverted repeats and transposable elements.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 164, "end": 188, "text": "Romano and Macino (1992)", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 389, "end": 406, "text": "(Fire et al. 1998", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1385, "end": 1407, "text": "(Jinek and Doudna 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1627, "end": 1648, "text": "(Siomi and Siomi 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1697, "end": 1719, "text": "(Song et al. 2004a, b;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1720, "end": 1742, "text": "Leuschner et al. 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1743, "end": 1765, "text": "Fulci and Macino 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2221, "end": 2244, "text": "(Leuschner et al. 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2840, "end": 2856, "text": "(Li et al. 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 3396, "end": 3400, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3401, "end": 3425, "text": "(Drinnenberg et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "RNA Interference in Fungi"}, {"text": "A significant facet of siRNA design involves identification and characterization of gene target which plays a key role in the survival of the organism such that suppression of the gene by inhibiting translation should limit the growth of the fungus. A particular fungal disease is often caused by more than one fungus, for instance, zygomycosis is caused by Rhizopus, Absidia, Mucor, and Rhizomucor. siRNA can be designed taking into consideration a conserved antifungal drug target present ubiquitously in the species, so that the drug discovery process becomes less intricate; but a crucial point to be taken care of is that the protein and its corresponding gene should not have similarities with the human genome, such that the human processes are not affected. For instance, cell wall is a very promising target in disease-causing fungi. The pathway for formation of cell wall is readily accessible (Moussian 2008) , and the KEGG database (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/) can be referred. Silencing a gene coding for a significant component of the cell wall biosynthesis pathway can delimit the formation of cell wall and hence restrain the growth of the pathogenic fungus. For instance, a study reported loss of a cell wall polysaccharide, \u03b1-(1,3) glucan synthase from the cell walls of Histoplasma capsulatum which led to decreased virulence and pathogenesis of the fungi (Rappleye et al. 2004) . Apart from the cell wall, targeting can be carried out against lipid biosynthesis pathways or at the translational or posttranslational levels. Previous studies have led to the confirmation of N-myristoyl transferase, lanosterol 14-\u03b1 demethylase, and geranylgeranyl transferase I as potential drug targets against which antifungal drugs benzofurans, azoles, and azaphilones have been designed, respectively (Kawasaki et al. 2003; Song et al. 2004; Singh et al. 2005 ).

Such constraints are often envisaged while designing effective siRNA against a fungal enzyme, as targeting only one out of many genes for a given enzyme target doesn't result in a very high efficacy for silencing (Yamada et al. 2007 ) silenced only one out of the three \u03b1-amylase genes in Aspergillus oryzae and found merely 10% silencing, which is not sufficient to enter the therapeutic phase. Hence, designing common siRNA for all the genes targeting an enzyme becomes a very arduous task. Chitin synthase is a wellaccepted antifungal drug target, yet it cannot be used to design siRNA(s) for R. oryzae because genome level analysis has revealed that 23 genes can encode chitin synthase (Ibrahim et al. 2009 ).

However, variability, often, has been observed in the gene silencing effect by dsRNA-producing transgenes depending on the target gene, the type of construct, site of integration, and transgene copy number. An IRT is constructed using a target gene sequence, which is incorporated in an organismspecific plasmid. The plasmid containing IRT is transformed into the organism that upon transcription forms a hairpin loop which is cleaved by endogenous Dicer to generate siRNA(s). The generated small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) cleave the endogenous mRNA(s) with the help of RISC.

But the transformation/cloning efficiency for long inverted repeats of a cDNA is very low, and the selection process is very time-consuming. The construction of lhRNA(s) is difficult as it involves several rounds of PCR and cloning steps, and moreover, it's necessary that vectors/ plasmids should be available for each species to carry out siRNA delivery. Generally the longer size of spacer helps in the easy cloning of the inverted repeat and improves the efficiency of RNAi. Here, the use of IR constructs containing a short spacer (20-50 bp) in the middle of an inverted repeat improves the cloning efficiency (Yu et al. 2004) . Moreover, the presence of introns as a spacer in the constructs also improves their effectiveness and enhances cloning efficiency [48. 49] (Wesley et al. 2001, Kalidas and Smith 2002) . Nevertheless, these strategies have been successfully used to trigger silencing in various fungal systems like Bipolaris oryzae (Moriwaki et al. 2007) in which an IRT was constructed consisting of sense and antisense polyketide synthase gene of 756 bp encoding for melanin production separated by a spacer of cutinase gene intron obtained from a study on Magnaporthe oryzae (Kadotani et al. 2003) , and this yielded melanin-deficient (white) phenotype in 70% transformants. Another study reported only 12% transformants of xlnR encoding xylanases and cellulases of A. niger (Oliveira et al. 2008) showing decreased activities compared to the control strain. The reason was attributed to either rearrangement in silencing constructs or apparent decrease in xylanolytic activities or may be absence of \"true\" co-transformants. Another prominent IRT successfully used in mammalian systems is the shorthairpin RNA (shRNA) which consists of a 19 bp siRNA sense and antisense sequence separated by a spacer of 9 nucleotides where the siRNA sequence should be 100% homologous to the target mRNA. The shRNA expression vectors available for mammalian systems require RNA polymerase III system as shown in Fig. 12.2.

Blotting techniques, fluorescence imaging, and biochemical assays are the further confirmatory tests which are used to analyze silencing at the RNA and protein levels. A study was carried out by Kadotani et al. (2003) in the blast fungus M. oryzae (Holen 2006) in which they investigated RNA silencing using enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP). Sense-sense, antisense-antisense, and sense-antisense IRT constructs of eGFP separated by a partial sequence of \u03b2-glucuronidase gene as internal spacer were employed. Significant silencing was induced only by sense-antisense IRT construct as detected by the loss of GFP fluorescence using an image analyzer. Several studies have employed Northern blot analysis for studying gene silencing in various fungi (Yamada et al. 2007; Kadotani et al. 2003; Hammond et al. 2007 Hammond et al. , 2008 Hammond and Keller 2005; Segers et al. 2006; Janus et al. 2007 ). The captured fluorescence images of plasmids (IRTs) containing fluorescence tags like GFP (Segers et al. 2006; Janus et al. 2007 ) assist in better understanding of protein localization, confirm the presence of plasmid in the cell, and also facilitate in differentiating the silenced from the non-silenced transformants. Real-time PCR and the reverse transcription PCR (Khatri and Rajam 2007; Oliveira et al. 2008; Janus et al. 2007; Liu et al. 2002) setup are also employed using appropriate genespecific primers to detect and quantify the gene transcript levels. Liu et al. conducted a study (Liu et al. 2002) on RNA silencing in the pathogenic fungus Cryptococcus neoformans where they constructed IRTs on genes related to capsule synthesis and adenine biosynthesis pathway. They observed 25% reduction in the gene expression imparting the transformants with dull and pink colonies, respectively, and silencing analyzed by employing reverse transcription PCR with genespecific primers and PCR product stained with SYBR Green I nucleic acid gel stain for analysis of DNA-associated fluorescence. Janus et al. investigated a reporter system DsRed to identify silencing transformants by cosilencing DsRed with the protein isopenicillin N synthase (pcbC) involved in cephalosporin C biosynthesis in the filamentous fungus Acremonium chrysogenum and employed immunoblotting using a polyclonal antibody against the isopenicillin N synthase to assess the downregulation of the pcbC gene (Janus et al. 2007 ). Biochemical assays can be performed as well which are specific for the enzyme/protein of interest to evaluate silencing of the target protein by specific siRNA(s). Hammond and Keller in 2005 executed the norsolorinic acid (NOR) analysis by thin-layer chromatography and observed whether the A. nidulans aflR IRTs can suppress NOR production (Hammond and Keller 2005) . Research discoveries in vitro need to be accompanied by establishment of the potentiality of siRNA as a therapeutic. The antifungal drug dosages within the therapeutic window have been tested and determined on animal models, mostly murine models (Ibrahim et al. 2008a, b) for fungal diseases like zygomycosis, aspergillosis, candidiasis, cryptococcosis; but no pharmacological studies have yet been conducted on animal models employing siRNA therapy for fungal infections. Thus, dedicated efforts are needed to assess siRNA therapy for mycoses in various animal models and further investigate in humans through clinical trials.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 421, "end": 443, "text": "Kadotani et al.

For instance, the past few decades have seen a rise in the opportunistic invasive fungal infections (mycoses) due to significant increase in the population of immunocompromised patients. The limitations of existing antifungal therapies have provided impetus toward exploring RNAi as a therapeutic option. N. crassa was the organism in which the first RNAi gene was discovered which was succeeded by numerous in vitro studies to achieve improved silencing in fungi and promising RNAi as a therapeutic tool. Identification of a potential target gene is necessitated against which siRNA is designed in silico, and recent whole-genome studies in fungi have greatly expedited the novel drug discovery process. Even though RNAi-related research discoveries have made rapid progress from in vitro to in vivo and clinical trials for neurodegenerative diseases and cancer, proper pharmacokinetic parameters of safety and efficacy for RNAi still remain to be answered for mycoses. RNAi as a therapeutic approach is relatively at a nascent stage, and uninterrupted probing should prove useful to drive it as a preferred option for the treatment of mycoses in the long run.",

Subsequently, it was marked the \"Breakthrough of the Year\" in 2002 by Science magazine. One of the recent developments in this field has been the FDA approval of siRNA (short interfering RNA) drug DGFi in 2008, developed by Quark Pharmaceuticals, Inc., for use in kidney transplantation. Another siRNA-based therapy, Sirna-027 originally developed by Sirna Therapeutics for the treatment of acute macular degeneration, is moving forward into phase II clinical trials. Hence, the vital relevance of innovative treatments like the siRNA therapy can be envisaged for antifungal infections. RNAi application has also been identified in functional genomics and therapeutics, viz., cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and multiple sclerosis besides fungal infection.
