There have been at least three lines of ACE2 knockout mice reported by various investigators [9] . Interestingly, there are significant differences in the phenotypes of these distinct lines, especially with regard to their cardiovascular physiology. ACE2 appears to have only modest effects on baseline cardiovascular functions and blood pressure control. These effects can be substantially modulated by genetic and, perhaps through environmental factors. In contrast, the activity of ACE2 may have more profound effects on susceptibility to pathological states, such as hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy.",

These mice exhibited a 50-fold increase in ACE2 expression in the heart. The mice then underwent occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery producing myocardial infarction. Nontransgenic control mice were subjected to the same procedure. Echocardiography and direct measurements of cardiac performance were performed. While ejection fraction plummeted by 59 % in normal mice, ACE2 overexpressing mice exhibited only a 21 % reduction in ejection fraction. The infarct size was also reduced by 50 %. The investigators then measured protein levels of ACE, ACE2, angiotensin II type-1 receptor (AT1R), angiotensin II type-2 receptor (AT2R), and the Mas receptor in the free wall of the left ventricles collected from normal shams, normal mice with infarction, and the corresponding ACE2 transgenic sham and infarcted mice. The ACE2 transgenic mice had the expected marked increase in ACE2 protein. The ACE protein increased in infarcted normal mice, but not in infarcted transgenic mice. AT1 receptor expression was little changed in the groups, while AT2 receptor protein was increased in the transgenic groups. The Mas receptor expression was increased in infarcted normal mice, but not in the corresponding transgenic group.",

More likely perhaps is an effect involving Ang1-7 and signaling through the Mas receptor. For instance, transactivation of ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases is inhibited by Ang1-7 via its Mas Receptor [12] . Mas, a G protein-coupled receptor, interacts with common heterotrimeric G proteins. Mas C-terminal tail interacting proteins have been identified by mass spectrometry and proteomics [13] .
