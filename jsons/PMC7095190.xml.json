The \u201cTime Out\u201d Day materials are ideal resources for a chapter presentation on medication safety.",

These are great resources for Perioperative Nurse Week when our \u201cVital to Care, Knowledge to Share\u201d theme will encourage chapter members to visit grade schools and spread the word about perioperative nursing. These resources also can be used for age-specific patient education in clinical sites, and they are available via a link from the AORN Online home page at http://www.aorn.org under \u201cWhat's New.\u201d The AORN Board and staff members are making a concerted effort to provide all of our members with the resources they need to maintain their education and competence and recruit and retain members and future perioperative nurses.",

            "text": "\n\u2022The Advanced Practice Issues Task Force is reviewing and revising the \u201cAORN position statement on the definition of perioperative advanced practice nurse\u201d2 and the \u201cPerioperative advanced practice nurse competency statements\u201d3 to include advanced practice RN first assistants.\u2022The Allied Health Care Providers and Assistive Personnel Task Force will review AORN's position statement on unlicensed assistive personnel4 and Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs standards and guidelines for accreditation of educational programs in surgical technology to create a position statement on the role of the RN in the education of students who will be assistive personnel.\u2022The Awards Committee is busy educating members about the new awards process and preparing for a creative new event at Congress that will recognize our award winners and highlight their award-winning initiatives. This new process will open the potential for winning awards to chapters that use diverse methods to get their message out. The process is restricted only by your imagination. I can't wait to see the results.\u2022The CMS Informed Consent Task Force was charged with soliciting input from members and developing specific examples of problems in implementing the new Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) guidelines on informed consent. They also will develop solutions that meet the spirit of what CMS is trying to accomplish. Our plan is to take these solutions to CMS for its consideration in light of its implementation of the current guidelines, which will be difficult to operationalize and maintain in hospitals and will place a definite burden on perioperative nurses.\u2022The Congress Education Planning Committee has selected the education sessions for our 2006 Congress, and committee members are busy processing Clinical Improvement/Innovation Poster submissions.\u2022The Emergency Management Task Force is charged with developing a guideline on how perioperative nurses can prepare to manage severe acute respiratory syndrome, avian flu, and other possible epidemics.\u2022The Environmental Task Force is developing a position and guidance statement on environmental responsibility in perioperative areas. They also will review the \u201cRecommended practices for surgical tissue banking.\u201d5\n\u2022International Resource Committee members serve as our advisors to support AORN in becoming the global leader in perioperative nursing. This group is collaborating on the two major international meetings for 2005, the World Conference in Barcelona, Spain, and the Americas Conference in Cancun, Mexico. This is a collaborative effort among AORN members and industry and international partners.\u2022The Legislative Committee is charged with facilitating the identification, implementation, and passage of efforts to add prescriptive language requiring an RN in the circulator role to the administrative or legislative codes of additional states. These initiatives will require active grassroots support in the identified bellwether states (ie, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Virginia, Washington).\u2022The Management Issues Task Force Just Culture will develop position and guidance statements on a just response to errors in the perioperative environment and creating a \u201cno-blame culture.\u201d\u2022The Members-at-Large (MAL) Task Force is evaluating the criteria for MAL membership so the Board can examine how this contingent of our membership will interface with the Association going forward.\u2022The Membership Committee is at the forefront of recruitment and retention initiatives. These group members are out there among you; they are the pulse of AORN. Then-Open House at Headquarters on the Friday night of the Leadership Conference was, as always, a real celebration of our members. Committee members also joined Board members in making presentations about practice issues at the conference and during the breakfast breakout sessions. You will see them at the First-Time Attendee Breakfast at Congress, as well as at the \u201cChapter Nuts and Bolts\u201d Pre-Congress session. They are everywhere. Look for them, ask questions, or give advice. They love it.\u2022The Mentoring Task Force introduced a new, formal Mentoring Program at the Leadership Conference that will connect potential leaders who are looking for a mentor with past AORN leaders for one-on-one guidance. We are wealthy with leaders who are willing to share their expansive wisdom and knowledge with future leaders. The Mentoring Program will facilitate this connection for interested members.\u2022The National Committee on Education (NCE) will be standardizing the format to address Perioperative Nursing Data Set (PNDS) terminology in the RN orientation position6 and guidance statements. The committee also will create position and guidance statements on orientation of novice to expert surgical technologists.\u2022The Next Generation Task Force has been instrumental in collaborating with the organization to assist in recognizing the needs of young nurses and in fostering their leadership skills. They will present a session at Congress on recruiting and retaining young perioperative nurses. This task force also is involved in the Extreme Chapter Makeover. The struggling Central Ohio chapter is working with Cynthia D'Amour, president and leadership coach of People Power Unlimited, Ann Arbor, Mich, to reengineer, reenergize, and completely change the look and feel of this chapter. D'Amour spoke at the 2001 AORN Leadership Conference where she gave us a long list of initiatives to recruit members and energize chapters. AORN of Central Ohio was losing members, attendance at meetings was declining rapidly, and participation had dwindled. They were in a downward spiral, and it was time to either do something drastic or disband. The results of this makeover will be available to all chapters at Congress so that we all may benefit from the lessons learned in Central Ohio. Get ready to use their model for your own chapter makeover.\u2022Nursing Practices Committee members are charged with reviewing and revising the AORN position statements on nurse-to-patient ratios7 and industry representatives8 and the guidance statement on reuse of single-use devices.9 They also anticipate collaborating with the NCE on review and revision of the competency statements in perioperative nursing.10\n\u2022The Nursing Research Committee and the PNDS Task Force are collaborating to develop a research study using the data collected from the electronic national benchmark database. If you want a preview of how the PNDS can be used, see the article that starts on page 51 of the July 2005 AORN Journal.11\n\u2022The On-Call Electronic Task Force will help the Board develop implementation strategies to facilitate the \u201cAORN position statement on safe work/on-call practices\u201d12 that was approved at Congress in 2005. At Congress, 23 members volunteered to work on this initiative.\u2022The Perioperative Nursing: Introduction at High School/Grade School Level Task Force will develop resources for chapters and members to use in schools for education on perioperative nursing. These resources will be available at http://www.aorn.org/about/nurseweek.htm. Get ready to use them during Perioperative Nurse Week. How many schools can we visit, and how many students can we touch? It is all up to us.\u2022The Perioperative Professional Excellence Criteria Task Force will develop criteria and measurement tools for perioperative professional excellence. Not all hospitals can be Magnet facilities, but we believe all perioperative services can be considered excellent if they meet specific criteria.\u2022The Presidential Commission on Patient Safety Task Force will concentrate on medication safety for adult and pediatric patients. The National \u201cTime Out\u201d Day campaign was an example of the resources that are available for our members to improve patient safety processes. Part of the commission's charge is to monitor the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations' National Patient Safety Goals and collaborate with other organizations, such as the American Society for Healthcare Risk Management.\u2022The Recommended Practices Committee continues to review and revise AORN recommended practices and develop strategies for moving the committee toward developing evidence-based practices and incorporating PNDS terminology. Their collaboration with members on the Presidential Commission on Patient Safety Task Force will result in recommended practices to prevent inadvertent hypothermia.\u2022The Specialty Assembly (SA) Futures Task Force is researching and developing a new model for the SAs. Research demonstrates that members of the younger generations do not want to participate in the organization through the traditional chapter model. We cannot afford to lose these members as future leaders who will drive the profession of perioperative nursing. We believe that the new SA model will attract them, and that was the purpose of offering a free SA membership through the Member Access proposal that was passed by the House of Delegates in 2005. The new web portals for the SAs were kicked off on July 1, 2005. This is step one in connecting all the members with the SAs and strengthening services to the specialty areas. Go online and take part in the energizing discussions. A leadership laboratory will be developed to support future growth of the organization.\u2022The Web Task Force is collaborating with AORN staff members to reengineer web services to members. These task force members serve as the members' voice regarding web strategy. They are in the process of implementing a listing of AORN committees and task forces with chair and member contact information and a method for members to communicate issues, needs, information, or discussion related to the work in progress.\u2022The Workplace Safety Task Force is researching and preparing to present a position statement and guidelines on ergonomically healthy workplace practices for the perioperative environment. This task force is collaborating with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and the American Nurses Association on the \u201cHandle With Care\u201d ergonomics campaign.13\n\n",
