            "text": "Skills Learning theory may provide strategies for learning retention of CPR skills. The learner needs to know what is expected during the acquisition of skills. For CPR training, this translates into demonstration of each component of the skill, as well as the entire skill sequence. The purpose of each of the components of CPR is necessary for the learner to know why it is in the skill sequence and what it provides (Lovell, 1980) . Sensory feedback from a learner's performance is vital to the success of learning the skill of CPR. Properly performed ventilations and compressions, look, feel and sound a specific way. Feedback is essential due to the complexity of the task. Simultaneous feedback is more effective than feedback at the end of performance. Feedback provided during the performance of CPR provides simultaneous feedback to correct any noted deficiencies. Practice of the skill is essential for ongoing performance to maintain competence (Lovell, 1980) . CPR Skill retention following cardiopulmonary resuscitation for health care providers has been documented over the past twenty years. Kaye (1990, 51) tested the retention of more than fifty house officers, discovering the knowledge base remained virtually unchanged after a period of five months, but that skills had declined significantly during the same amount of time. Moser and Coleman (1992, 372) agreed, determining knowledge is retained longer than the actual skill of CPR, but skills decline as quickly as two weeks post training, and are at pre-training levels by 1-2 years. Frequent skill updates may be appropriate in order to retain CPR skills. Woollard (2006, 237) examined optimal refresher intervals for laypersons who had initially sat through a four hour course. Some twenty four individuals received refresher classes at seven and twelve months or at the twelve month interval. Results concluded there was greater skill loss when the refresher course occurred at twelve months rather than seven months, leading to the conclusion refresher training should not exceed seven month intervals.",

More than one hundred subjects were randomized into two groups, one using a 30 minute course and the other the traditional heartsaver four hour course.

            "text": "Improvement measures for CPR skill retention have been studied, some proving to be more effective than others. Olasveengen (2007, 427) looked at providing performance feedback on CPR to ambulance services might improve overall skill performance. Eighty five out of hospital cardiac arrests were compared after performance evaluations were provided. No improvement was noted in the quality of basic life support was noted after providing performance evaluation as before the implementation of performance evaluation. Attempts to improve the quality of CPR were unsuccessful. Parnell (2007, 271) theorized poor performance in CPR may be due to poor instruction on the part of the teacher. Investigating a number of classes taught in New Zealand, it was noted approximately \u00be of the courses passed students although hand placement and depth compression was correct 57% of the time. Learners who are determined to be competent with inaccurate hand placement and depth compression will not be able to perform CPR effectively. Further, studies to determine if the learner is retaining CPR may not be deterioration in skills but rather a symptom of the student never being competent to begin with. Rittenberger (2006, 365) measured the ability of thirty six pre-hospital providers to manage the skills of ventilation, chest compressions and AED usage. Randomly assigning subjects to three different groups of skills, it was noted the more skills added to the scenario, the quality and quantity of basic life support diminishes. Providing ventilations was correct more often when provided alone than when in combination with chest compressions. More compressions were delivered with basic life support alone than when combined with the use of an AED. The use of a prompt or automatic device during the performance of CPR may improve basic life support during resuscitation.",

Hypothesizing that a bag valve mask device with pressure flow response valve would assist nursing personnel in appropriate ventilations, almost forty nurses were tested for initial skill levels, then trained with the feedback device vs the standard bag valve mask. At three months, there was very little variation in ability to ventilate the patient. By six months there was a marked difference between the two groups, noting the group trained with the feedback device was much more proficient in ventilations. This would appear to support the premise that a feedback device during ventilation compensates for the deterioration over time in ventilation skills.",

Randomizing the pre-hospital providers, each group performed three minutes of CPR on a VAM. During one round the VAM was turned on, and during one round the VAM was turned off. A general decay was initially noted in the compression depth over the three minute time frame, but with the use of the VAM, the decay was decreased. While the use of the VAM did not directly improve ventilation or compression quality or the rates, the use of the VAM did improve the gradual decay in compressions and ventilations by the pre-hospital provider. Isbye (2008, 73) used forty three medical students measured the difference in skill level between instructor facilitated training and an automated voice advisory mannequin. Two randomized groups were used to compare training between CPR and the use of a bag valve mask immediately after training and again at a three month interval. There was no statistical difference between the two groups in CPR skills immediately after training or three months later. The instructor facilitated group scored higher overall when the bag valve mask skill was added into the total score. Bag valve mask skills were performed better when an instructor facilitated the training. The authors concluded the retention of bag valve mask skills were better when an instructor facilitated the training than the use of an automated voice advisory mannequin.",

Half were provided a feedback device and the other half were not. Chest compressions were noted to be ineffective in 36% of the control group. With a few seconds of training with the feedback device, the compression depth improved to an acceptable level. Further study needs to be done to determine if the use of this particular feedback device during training would lead to an improvement in skill retention over time. Perkins (2005, 103) had virtually the same results the previously. Using twenty medical students and a manikin on a hospital bed, three minutes of CPR was performed.

Simulating cardiac arrests, eighty nurses were randomized into two groups. After three trials of simulated cardiac arrest, the quality of CPR was recorded using a sensing defibrillator that measures chest compression and depth, as well as delivers audiovisual feedback. Finding the debriefing only group improved compressions significantly (from 38%-68%), the combination of feedback and debriefing was noted to be more impressive. The number of individuals providing adequate rate and depth of compressions moved from 29% to 64%. Debriefing and feedback during CPR may improve rescuer training for cardiac arrest patients. Yang (2009, 490 ) performed a randomized controlled study with a scenario developed to simulate cardiac arrest in a public place. Using 96 adults without CPR training for at least five years were randomized to receive dispatch assistance on compressions with either voice instruction alone or interactive voice and video demonstration and feedback. It was determined the addition of interactive video communication to dispatcher-assisted chest compression-only CPR initially delayed the commencement of chest compressions, but subsequently improved the depth and rate of compressions.",

            "text": "Objective feedback improved acquisition and retention of chest compressions among healthcare students in a 2007 study by Spooner. The feedback group demonstrated better compression depth and more correct compressions at initial testing. Skill retention remained high for six weeks following the initial training, however, deteriorated significantly afterwards, which is consistent with other studies. Sutton (2007, 161 ) used a voice activated manikin system to compare immediate, standardized, corrective audio feedback training (VAM) to quality standardized instructor feedback during pediatric basic life support. Results concluded the VAM group provided more chest compressions and correct ventilations per minute, with an overall lower error rate, indicating the use of VAM during initial pediatric basic life support improves initial performance and skill acquisition. Wik (2001, 167) determined manikins which provide auditory feedback to an individual during the performance of CPR improved skills. Performance immediately improved when the prompt was activated and deteriorated when it was discontinued. The voice activated manikin (VAM) suggests this training tool minimizes the number of mistakes, never alters from the CPR guidelines and never misses inaccuracies during administration of CPR. The VAM may be an effective instruction tool. Wik (2002, 273) also tested the retention of CPR skills following training with a voice activated manikin (VAM). When baseline CPR skills were noted to be poor, within 20 minutes there was improvement noted in the VAM. Over training included thirty minute extra practice sessions in three minute sessions and were found to exhibit improved retention in chest compressions and adequate ventilations at six months, whereas the control group was no longer competent Wik (2005, 27 ) evaluated retention of CPR skills at twelve months using a VAM. Thirty five volunteers had individual training sessions on a VAM, with one third receiving another 30 minutes of instruction in three minute increments. Ventilation and compression variables were measured immediately after training, at the six month interval as well as at twelve months. There were virtually no variables in CPR skills when tested with active feedback 12 months post training, with some decline in the number of chest compressions being performed after 12 months in the group trained for 20 minutes. VAM can improve the performance of CPR skills on a manikin with no deterioration in performance after 12 months. Williamson (2005, 140) noted the use of AED audio prompts on CPR performance improved the quality of CPR in the untrained layperson. Using 24 subjects, all were asked to perform CPR on a manikin with and without the assistance of an audio prompt device. All subjects were trained in CPR, then retested eight weeks later. Untrained subjects were noted to perform poorly, but repeat performance after audio prompts resulted in significant improvements in compression rate and percentage of correct ventilations. After training, there was no difference in CPR performance with or without audio prompts, although \u00be of the subjects stated they felt more comfortable performing CPR with the prompts.",

            "text": "Prompt devices during CPR skill performance have been reviewed in a number of studies. Beckers (2007, 100) took first year medical students and examined their performance using CPREzy. Use of this device improved rate, depth, and correct depth of compression on manikins. Van Berkom (2008, 66) reviewed CPREzy device in terms of how much work was involved with the use of the device than without. While no additional force is required of the compressor, additional work was noted. Handley (2003, 57) determined the use of audible corrective instruction during CPR skill performance improved inflations and chest depth compressions. Jantti (2009, 453) determined the use of a metronome improved the rate of compressions, but had no effect on depth of compressions or ventilations. Monsieurs (2005, 41) utilized a public access resuscitator to improve CPR performance. Immediately after training BLS performance on the number of ventilations and compressions which mirrored the current guidelines. Chiang (2005, 297) determined audio prompts could improve adherence to CPR guidelines in the clinical setting by improving the hands off period for CPR with the use of an audio prompt device. Fletcher (2008, 127) and Boyle (2002, 63) concurred in separate studies. Niles (2009, 553) took an approach of measuring leaning on the chest in the pediatric population during compressions. Automated feedback during CPR decreased the amount of leaning with chest compressions. Milander (1995, 708) was an early study on animals, noting chest compressions and ETCO2 improved with audible tones during CPR. Berg (1994, 35) determined ETCO2 improved in children with an audio prompt during CPR. The improved ETCO2 suggested an overall improvement in the quality of CPR. In a two phase study by Williamson (2005, 140) one group improved with the use of audio prompts and the other showed no improvement. France (2006, 160) noted in a letter to Williamson a study which used prompts in some instances and not in others.
