This consists of the use of technological equipment that reliably imitates the sensation of touch that the operator may experience when in contact with real objects without coming into physical contact with them. In this way, haptic simulators are being applied in the field of endodontics, restorative dentistry and dental prostheses, among others.",

CBT has been proven effective for the treatment of psychiatric disorders, and has begun to be applied for psychosomatic problems in the dental patients. The prevalence of TMD in a community sample was almost 17.5% and the incidence even higher during the worldwide epidemic. Studies reported that CBT was more effective than no treatment. 1 Although CBTs were mainly conducted by psychologists, those conducted by trained dental hygienists were also found to be effective in reducing TMD pain and painrelated interference.",

Approximately 10-12% of the adult population suffer from dental anxiety. 3 A significant reduction in subjective anxiety was achieved by patients with CBT when compared to those who received no treatment or anaesthesia/sedation. This study suggests more attention needs to be paid to patients with psychosomatic problems caused by acute dental pain and other urgent conditions; accessibility to online consulting service systems should be further strengthened and improved, particularly for confirmed cases who are in self-quarantine.",

Furthermore, isolation at home for a long period of time, suspension of dental services and high risk of dental treatment due to aerosolised respiratory secretions and close doctor-patient contact may exacerbate existing mental conditions and produce new oral psychosomatic disorders such as temporomandibular disorders (TMD), burning mouth syndrome (BMS), dental anxiety and other oral complaints.",
