MHV infection of mice provides an excellent model for studying acute and chronic persistent diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) [2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. Certain strains of the MHV (such as A59 and JHM), produce a chronic demyelinating disease, probably due to immune mediated mechanisms, sharing many of the pathologic hallmarks with those of the human demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis (MS) [12, 13, 14].",

MHV infection of the CNS induces enhanced expression of MHC class I antigens on brain cells in vitro and in vivo [15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. However, the significance of MHC induction in mHV infection is still not clear. It can potentially enable cytotoxic phenomena on neural cells including oligodendrocytes, by CD8+ cells which require recognition by MHC class I antigens on the surface of the target cells. In SCID mice, in which the B- and T-cell immune components are nonfunctional, infection by MHV does not produce significant demyelination [20], suggesting that a subset of the affected immune cells in SCID mice are important for demyelination. The cells which affect the rate and quality of the demyelinating process were characterized as Thy1+ cells [21], presumably a subset of T cells.",

In order to examine whether CD8+ cells also affected demyelination, we previously studied the ability of MHV-A59 to produce demyelination in \u03b22-microglobulin \u2018knockout\u2019 (\u03b22M(-/-)) mice [24, 25]. Since the \u03b22-microglobulin is part of the MHC class I protein, disruption of \u03b22-microglobulin expression interferes with normal expression of MHC class I and the development of functional CD8+ cells in \u03b22M(-/-) mice [26]. We found that demyelination developed in some \u03b22M(-/-) mice following infection with a lethal dose of MHV-A59, thus CD8+ cells were not an absolute requirement for demyelination [24]. However, the pathogenesis of the disease and the reasons for the increased susceptibility of \u03b22M(/-) mice to MHV infection were still unknown. Thus, in the present study we investigated the effect of lack of CD8+ cells on organ pathology, and the cellular reservoirs for viral infection, in both acute and chronic MHV infection of \u03b22M(-/-) mice.",

Mice were produced by the combination of B6 and 129/J [24]. Additional \u03b22M(-/-) mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. The lethal dose of MHV-A59 that killed 50% of the mice (LD50 dose) was found to be 5 PFU/mouse, compared to 3,000 PFU in B6 mice [24]. Groups of 3-5 per time point, 4-week-old mice, were inoculated intracerebrally (IC) with 20 \u03bc of the viruses, and were sacrificed by methoxyflurane overdose at various intervals postinoculation (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15, 30 days postinoculation) and perfused intracardially with PBS and 10% phosphate-buffered formalin. Control mice were mock-infected with the same volume of sterile L2 cell lysate not containing virus. To ensure that the colony of \u03b22M(-/-) mice was truly deficient of CD8+ cells, random analyses of cells from the spleen and lymph nodes from uninfected \u03b22M(-/-) mice were carried out.

Disease in either B6 or 129/J mice was identical. Normal susceptible mice (B6) infected with 5,000 PFU/mouse (1-2 LD50 dose) of the neurotropic virus MHV-A59 developed both encephalitis and hepatitis. Following IC inoculation with 10 PFU of MHV-A59 (2 LD50), \u03b22M(-/-) mice developed clinical signs of acute disease including ruffled fur, hunched position, decreased motility and appetite, lethargy, limb weakness, and eventually death. These clinical signs were similar to the ones observed in B6 mice infected with 5,000 PFU of MHV-A59. Thus, \u03b22M(-/-) mice required 500-fold less virus than B6 mice to produce a similar mortality rate and clinical disease. Previous analysis of viral titers in organs of the two types of mice infected with MHV-A59 showed that \u03b22M(-/-) mice infected with 10 PFU had higher and more sustained titers of virus as compared to B6 mice infected with 5,000 PFU of MHV-A59 [24].

Four-week-old \u03b22M(-/-) mice were inoculated i.c. with MHV-2 and analyzed, at various intervals postinfection, for histopathology and viral titers in organs. Histology revealed both acute hepatitis and acute encephalitis. Acute encephalitis was observed in several periventricular areas especially the lateral and 4th ventricles. Mononuclear lymphocytic infiltration involved the choroid plexus, the ependyma and in the surrounding brain parenchyma especially in the brainstem (fig. 2). There was no involvement of other areas of the brain including areas that are typically involved in A59 infection of B6 mice. By contrast, B6 mice infected with MHV-2 showed mostly inflammation of the meninges and choroid plexus while brain parenchyma was only minimally involved. Sustained titers of infectious virus were detected by plaque assay were detected in both brains and livers of \u03b22M(-/-) mice infected with MHV-2. Titers peaked at 3 and 5 days after MHV-2 infection of B6 mice (fig. 3). Neither B6 mice nor 5 \u03b22M(-/-) mice sacrificed 30 days postinfection with 1 LD50 dose of MHV-2, showed any evidence of demyelination in Epon-embedded sections stained with toluidine blue.",

For example, \u03b22M(-/-) mice exhibited delayed clearance and increased mortality following influenza virus challenge [34]. Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection induced a chronic wasting disease in \u03b22M(-/-) mice [35].

During acute encephalitis in \u03b22M(-/-) mice there was slight change in the anatomical pattern of spread of the virus, in that the thalamus and basal ganglia had more extensive involvement. The amount of involvement of neuronal and glial cells infection was relatively similar in \u03b22M(-/-) mice and B6 mice. The main change in CNS disease in \u03b22M(-/-) mice was in additional cellular reservoirs of infectious virus in cell types that are not typically involved or only minimally infected in MHV-A59 infection of B6 mice. This included perivascular lymphocytes, microglia, and endothelial cells.

MHV-2 and MHV-A59 are closely related strains of MHV exhibiting over 80% homology in nucleotide sequences [Das Sarma et al., manuscript in preparation]. However, the two strains differ in the degree of CNS involvement. While MHV-A59 produces acute encephalitis and chronic demyelination, MHV-2 produced much less encephalitis and no demyelination. We asked whether mice lacking CD8+ show more parenchymal involvement in MHV-2 infection, in order to explore the possible role of CD8+ cells in brain invasion and demyelination. Our results demonstrated that MHV-2 infection in \u03b22M(-/-) mice produced significant brainstem encephalitis without demyelination, while parenchymal involvement in MHV-2-infected B6 mice was minimal. Thus, CD8+ cells may affect the spread of MHV within the brain, but have no effect on demyelination.",

The reduced rate of demyelination in \u03b22M(-/-) mice may be due to the lower dose of virus used and the finding that the lack of CD8+ cells did not affect the susceptibility of mice to demyelination, despite the increased susceptibility to hepatitis and encephalitis [32].",
