However, the large size of the molecules may hinder efficient tissue penetration. This obstacle can be overcome using Fab or single-chain Fv (scFv) fragments, as they are three to six times smaller than full-sized antibodies. However, cloning these fragments, consisting of heavy and light chain variable regions linked by disulfide bridges or a linker, is challenging and they are not always efficiently expressed [1].",

They combine the advantages of both immunoglobulins and small molecules and provide an alternative to conventional antibodies and binders derived from alternative scaffolds. Sharks also produce a unique heavy-chain only immunoglobulin that does not associate with light chains, referred to as IgNAR. V domains of IgNAR are often applied in biotechnological and biomedical fields (for a review [2]).",

They can thus be easily engineered, cloned, and expressed with high yields using various expression systems [15].-VHHs are highly soluble and stable, even under denaturing conditions or high temperatures [16].-The high variability of the length and sequence of VHHs allows them to recognize a variety of protein epitopes, located not only on the surface of a protein [17], but also buried deep in the clefts [18]. VHHs have been shown to recognize a wide range of epitope types, from small haptens [16,19] to the binding sites of enzymes [17,20], and can bind epitopes that cannot be recognized by conventional antibodies [21].-The small size and basic isolectric point of VHHs allows them to penetrate tissues, pass through barriers, such as the blood-brain barrier [[22], [23], [24], [25], [26]], and bind intracellular antigens.-VHHs can be efficiently functionalized [[27], [28], [29]] and are widely used for imaging [24,26,30].\n",

Trypanolytic VHH An46 disturbs the endocytic machinery of the parasite in the flagellar pocket of the parasite. Nontrypanolytic VHH An33 was made more potent by linking the nontoxic prodrug cephalosporin mustard (CCM) onto the highly toxic PDM at the surface of the parasite [61]. Linking this VHH to apolipoprotein l-I resulted in an immunotoxin that lyses almost all trypanosomes [18]. Another approach is to couple pentamidine, a first-line antitrypanosomiasis, to VHH An33 to effectively target the drug to the parasite. In vivo, a ten-fold lower dose than the minimal full curative dose of free pentamidin incorporated into this conjugate cured all infected mice, wheras a 100-fold lower dose cured 60% of them [62]. Parasite development in the tsetse fly and subsequent spread of the parasite can be controlled through the expression of trypanolytic VHHs in genetically modified tsetse fly symbionts [63]. In addition, VHHs that target the paraflagellar rod protein of varioius trypanosomes have been described, but are mainly useful as diagnostic markers of trypanosiomasis [64]. A VHH (Nb474) directed against T. congolese aldolase (TcoALD) has been developped for a sandwich immunoassay. This VHH is highly specific and did not recognize other trypanosomes such as T. brucei brucei, T. vivax and T. evansi [65,66].",

SIV and AIV are transmitted from pigs or birds to humans, respectively, mostly via direct contact with infected animals. The infection in humans ranges from mild self-limiting respiratory-like illness to death. However, pandemic outbreaks remain unpredictable, as illustrated by the 2009 H1N1 virus (also named Mexican flu) and H5N1 virus. Occasional zoonotic infections with these viruses and their high propensity to reassort with SIV have earmarked them as a major pandemic threat [67].",

These VHHs were fused to an anti-albumin VHH to extend its serum half-life and were able to neutralize the virus at picomolar doses [76]. A combined treatment based on VHH and vaccine (Rabipur, Novartis) acted synergistically to protect mice in an intranasal rabies infection model [77].

These VHHs can be engineered in various ways to improve their diagnostic and/or therapeutic properties and efficacy. In addition, VHHs readily and rapidly penetrate tissues, even the brain, and it is likely that specific VHH-based constructs will be developed that can neutralize agents involved in brain infections, such as influenza [68], Zika, or rabies virus. Overall, VHHs or VHH-based molecules are potentially valuable diagnostic and therapeutic reagents to treat ZDs.",
