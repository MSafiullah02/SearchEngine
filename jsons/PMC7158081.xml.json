            "text": "Sepsis is described as a serious organ dysfunction which results from response of dysregulated host to infection. This syndrome is an important healthcare problem that affects significant morbidity and mortality [1]. Early identification of sepsis and aggressive management in first hour are cornerstones for improving patient outcomes [2]. Delay in an initial appropriate antimicrobial therapy has been correlated with an increase in mortality [3]. The initial selection of appropriate antimicrobial is defined in terms of broad-spectrum and adequate dosing of selected antimicrobial for suspected pathogens [3]. However, appropriate antimicrobial dosing is challenging because of altered pharmacokinetics (PK) and increased multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms in critically ill patients [4]. A larger volume of distribution, which is caused by fluid resuscitation and capillary leak syndrome, culminates in subtherapeutic levels of antimicrobial [5]. The fluctuation of renal clearance, such as augmented renal clearance or acute kidney injury, could affect by increasing or decreasing antimicrobials concentrations [6]. In addition, Suwantarat et al. reported a high prevalence of MDR gram-negative bacteria in Thailand, including 28.7% for carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 45.2% for extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) producers, and 76.3% for carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii [7]. Due to the spread of antimicrobial-resistant organisms, as well as a decline in new antimicrobial developments, the exploration for effective antimicrobial activity based on PK and pharmacodynamic (PD) properties is the solution [4]. Moreover, the standard recommended dose of antibiotic, which was derived from (1) PK data from healthy volunteers or non-intensive care unit (ICU) patients, and (2) the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for non-resistant bacteria, may increase the risk of treatment failure [4]. Roberts et al. performed a PK study of 8 beta-lactam antibiotics in critically ill patients across 68 ICUs in 10 European countries. From a total of 248 patients, 16% of patients did not achieve 50% of the time of free antibiotic concentrations above the minimum inhibitory concentration (fT>MIC) of the pathogen, and these patients were less likely to complete a treatment course and achieve positive clinical outcome with the initially selected beta-lactam [8].",

The PD of meropenem is a time-dependent activity, similar to other beta-lactam antibiotics. At least 40% fT>MIC is required for carbapenems to achieve their bactericidal activity [4]. However, to achieve favorable microbiological and clinical outcomes for critically ill patients with severe infections, achievement of 100% fT>MIC is required, and prolonged infusion of meropenem is recommended [6, 9]. Additionally, the standard recommended dose of meropenem was not sufficient to achieve a higher PK/PD target in sepsis and septic shock patients [4, 10, 11]. Jaruratanasirikul et al. conducted a population PK study of meropenem in critically ill patients. They also indicated that the maximum recommended dose of 2 g of meropenem every 8 h may be needed for an early phase of sepsis and septic shock [12].",

In addition, each component of the SOFA score was not worsening in both of the standard-dose and the high-dose groups. The explanation of this comparable delta mSOFA between the standard-dose and the high-dose meropenem might be as follows. First, the pathophysiology of sepsis and septic shock starts from dysregulated host responses to infection. A combination of hemodynamic and cellular failures were then followed constantly [13]. Appropriate antibiotic therapy at an early point of sepsis diagnosis will help in reducing microbial load. Consequently, the burden from microbial toxin released or produced by bacteria will be terminated [14]. Inflammatory response leading to tissue injury would then be declined [14]. Since critically ill patients have substantially physiologic changes, the suboptimal concentration of antibiotics was reported [8, 15, 16]. Thus, high-dose antibiotics should be taken into consideration to achieve better clinical outcomes [6]. Nevertheless, cellular failure due to the individual dysregulated host responses to pro-inflammatory cytokine and alteration of cellular immune function may also progress and might not have been helped by the higher dose of antibacterial [13, 17]. Second, 44.7% of patients included in our study had a negative culture, which might have been from non-infectious causes, viruses, or fungal infection [18, 19]. In fact, supportive treatments such as fluid resuscitation, vasopressor therapy, and nursing care were appropriate in both of the standard-dose and the high-dose groups.",

Besides, even though there was a trend of higher ICU- and hospital-free days in the high-dose group, there was no statistical difference between the groups. The secondary outcomes\u2019 results might have been confounded by a persistent inflammation-immunosuppression and catabolism syndrome (PICS), and post-sepsis syndrome which are increasingly found in critically ill patients [20, 21].

This was because the higher concentration of meropenem at the site of infection was required in order to get a better microbiological cure [22, 23]. Regarding the meropenem concentration in our study, both regimens of meropenem achieved PD target of 40% of the time above the identified MIC. Considering suspected resistant bacteria, achieving the PD target of 40%T>MIC of 8 mg/L was higher in the high-dose group (9/10 patients, 90%) compared with the standard-dose group (5/8 patients, 62.5%). Likewise, achieving the PD target of 100%T>MIC was higher in the high-dose group (4/10 patients, 40%) compared to the standard-dose group (2/8 patients, 25%). Since there was a small number of blood samples collected, statistical differences were not found. Frippiat et al. performed Monte Carlo simulation to estimate meropenem concentration at epithelial lining fluid (ELF) for meropenem 2 g every 8 h and 1 g every 8 h. At MIC 0.5 mg/L, which was the most cut point MIC in our study, prolonged infusions of meropenem 2 g every 8 h demonstrated \u2265 90% probability of target attainment (PTA) of 100%T>MIC. While meropenem 1 g every 8 h demonstrated \u2265 90% PTA of 40%T>MIC [24]. Consequently, an increasing meropenem plasma concentration in the high-dose group might assumingly have an increasing trend in meropenem concentration in ELF, which was a target site in almost half of the patients in our study. Nevertheless, we still did not find statistically significant difference between the two groups regarding microbiological cure.",

Since this is the first study identifying different outcomes between two meropenem dosing regimens in ED, high-severity patients might get better outcomes from the higher dose of meropenem. The reason for better microbiological cure might be from higher tissue penetration and overall maintenance of plasma concentration in severe patients. Goncalves et al. found that critically ill patients with a greater baseline severity had a significant increase in the volume of distribution, leading to low meropenem concentrations. Decreased antibiotic concentration at the infection site was eventually found from reduced microvascular perfusion in critically ill patients [25, 26]. However, the high-dose meropenem did not demonstrate better clinical outcomes, delta mSOFA, mortality, vasopressor-free days, ventilator-free days, ICU-free days, and hospital-free days, in these 3 groups of patients.",

Therefore, the sample size might not have been enough to detect significances between the two dosing strategies. Second, the negative culture found in about 50% of patients in our study, impact on different meropenem dosing could not be assumed. Early differentiation of non-bacterial infection from bacterial infection before empirical therapy has not yet been easily done in our institution. Third, almost all of our patients\u2019 relatives experienced grief when confronted with a deteriorating phase of their love ones. Informed consent regarding blood sample collection was too difficult when there was a treatment limitation decision. For that reason, meropenem blood concentration collection was performed in only 5% of our recruited patients. Lastly, pathogens identified in this study had relatively low MICs. Narrowing the group of patients that might benefit from the high-dose group might be an option. Patient medical history, local antibiogram, and epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance in each area might be needed to modify inclusion criteria in order to specify the group of patients likely to be infected by higher MICs.",
