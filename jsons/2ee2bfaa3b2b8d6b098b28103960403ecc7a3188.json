It will include the prevalence of group A pharyngotonsillitis among children and adults worldwide and the selective tests employed for diagnosing group A streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis. Pharyngotonsillitis is one of the common reasons for visits to primary care clinics worldwide, and physicians tend to prescribe antibiotics according to the clinical symptoms, which leads to overprescribing antibiotics. This in turn may lead to serious health impacts and severe reactions and may promote antibiotic resistance. These significantly add on to the health care costs. The available information from health organisations and previous studies has indicated the need to manage the diagnosis of pharyngotonsillitis to improve prescribing habits in primary care clinics.",

Group A streptococcal (GAS) infection frequently causes significant morbidity and is associated with significant mortality rates worldwide. Around the world, more than 600 million cases annually have been diagnosed as pharyngotonsillitis (1) . Serious complications of pharyngotonsillitis caused by Streptococcus pyogenes (also known as group A streptococcus) are rheumatic fever, scarlet fever, toxic shock syndrome, and acute glomerulonephritis (2) . Streptococcus pyogenes is responsible for about 15%-30% and about 5%-10% of acute pharyngotonsillitis cases in children and adults, respectively (1) . Clinical signs and symptoms alone cannot be used to rule out or diagnose pharyngotonsillitis, as it can mimic other types of diagnosed infections (3) . Thus, diagnosis of pharyngotonsillitis has always been delayed. Ideally, the diagnosis of GAS pharyngotonsillitis should be confirmed by throat swab culture, which usually takes two to three days for the bacterial growth to be identified. During this period, the illness might be resolved, or patients might experience several complications (1) . Viral pharyngotonsillitis is treated by a symptomatic relief, whereas GAS pharyngotonsillitis may require the prescription of antibiotics such as penicillin, clindamycin, or erythromycin. A specific treatment might be required if complications occur (4, 5) . In general, 3 . What are the clinical scoring tools to diagnose group A streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis? 4 . What are the sensitivity and specificity of the Centor scoring system? 5 . What are the treatment and diagnosis of group A streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis in primary care practice?",

In addition, pharyngotonsillitis is common in patients with influenza A and constitutes about 50% of the cases, whereas the proportion is lower in patients with influenza B (11) . The Epstein-Barr virus is responsible for 19% of pharyngotonsillitis cases and usually spreads from adults to infants (11) . Moreover, coxsackieviruses and echoviruses are common enteroviruses that cause pharyngitis (11) . Cytomegalovirus, parainfluenza viruses, coronaviruses, and the measles virus may cause pharyngotonsillitis (1, 11) . Bacteria cause about 15%-30% of pharyngotonsillitis cases (12) . The most common and important bacteria that cause acute pharyngotonsillitis belong to Streptococcus pyogenes (group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus). Streptococcus pyogenes is responsible for about 15%-30% that weaken the immune system, such as diabetes, organ transplant, chemotherapy, and AIDS (38) . All racial and ethnic groups are affected by pharyngotonsillitis worldwide and the infection can affect both male and female genders (39).",

The highest prevalence of group A pharyngotonsillitis was recorded in the Middle East, while the studies in the Southeast Asian countries has reported the lowest the prevalence. The rate of infection was higher among children than adults. These variations in the prevalence of group A pharyngotonsillitis between the different countries due to several factors such as the study design, sampling technique, cultural, ecological, and others (37) . Furthermore, the incidence pharyngotonsillitis is more common in children, especially in school age because they are in close contact with the pathogens, where infection spreads through close contact with an infected child, when a person inhale droplets of respiratory secretions from the air when an infected person breathes, coughs, or sneezes (38) . An environment, polluting the environment and the lack of ventilation and air pollution, all of these environmental factors reinforce the spread of infection (14) . In addition, the peak incidences of pharyngotonsillitis occur in the winter and spring with sporadic cases throughout the year (38) . Other risk factors for pharyngotonsillitis are sickle cell anemia, sinusitis, smoking or exposure to secondary smoke, and any condition S o u t h A f r i c a S a u d i A r a b i a E g y p t I r a n P a k i s t a n A u s t r a l i a J a p a n T h a i l a n d S i n g a p o r e I n d o n e s i a I n d i a Y e m e n E t h i o p i a S e r b i a T u r k e y F r a n c e U K U S A C a n a d a B r a z i l A r g e n t i n a (45) . According to previous studies, rapid antigen detection test has been hindered because it has low sensitivity (46) . Therefore, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) guidelines have recommended that the negative RADT results should be backed up by a swab throat culture to increase the accuracy of the diagnosis (47). However, RADT has a high specificity, this means that the positive RADT results do not require to be backed up by a swab throat culture (48) . More recently, molecular based techniques, such as DNA probes and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have been developed to identify the pathogens that cause pharyngitis. It is a sensitive, and specific method, but it is not used routinely in most of the countries around the world, and usually it is used in epidemiological studies (49) . Anti-streptolysin-O (ASO) test is a rapid latex agglutination test to determine antistreptolysin-O antibodies in patient's serum who had a recent \u03b2-haemolytic streptococci infection. The titer increases after 7 days of infection and reach the peak after 4 to 6 weeks (50).",

(55) have developed set of four criteria which might be used to identify the likelihood of group A streptococcal infection in adult patients complaining of a sore unable to identify patients in a low or high-risk case. However, several studies have shown that Centor and MacIsaac scoring have a sensitivity more than 80% and a specificity more than 60% (8, 53) . of two or three is require testing by using rapid antigen detection test or throat culture, because the chance of streptococcal infection is around 10%-28% and require anti-microbial therapy only if the result is positive. However, a patient with a score of four should be tested by using rapid antigen detection test or throat culture, and empiric antibiotic therapy is required due to chance of streptococcal infection is high between 38% and 64% ( Figure 3 ) (61). Previous studies about the accuracy of Centor criteria have shown that, the sensitivity of absence of cough and swollen anterior cervical lymph nodes was higher than the specificity (sensitivity 76%, specificity 48% and sensitivity 68%, specificity 58%, respectively), while the specificity of the presence of fever (\u2265 38 \u00b0C) and tonsillar exudates was higher than sensitivity (sensitivity 51%, specificity 71% and sensitivity 58% and specificity 75%, respectively throat. Centor criteria including the presence of fever equal to or more than 38 \u00b0C, absence of cough, swollen anterior cervical lymph nodes, and tonsillar exudates or swelling, one point is added for each criterion. The Centor scores might range from 0-4 (Table 5 ) (55). ",

There are reasons for inappropriate prescriptions are very difficult to curb, including the difficulty of diagnosis of whether a viral or bacterial infection to determine the appropriate treatment and it is known antibiotics can only be given to patients with bacterial infection (70) .

Although, there is a lack of the data on the above matters, the available studies indicated that, there is an urgent need to reduce the overprescription of antibiotics in the health care centres and clinics. One of the solutions is to follow the strategies that help to diagnose group A streptococcal infection. According to previous studies, the clinical rules for triaging patients who should undergo group A streptococcal testing was poor, however, Centor and MacIsaac scoring have shown high sensitivity and acceptable specificity. Further validation studies about the clinical prediction rules are needed to ensure the accuracy and update the clinical strategies. Future studies should also aim to detect the accuracy of diagnosis using the rapid antigen detection testing and the gold standard to diagnose group A streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis.",

The risk is that the patients who do not receive appropriate therapy will have a longer period of disease or fatal effect; moreover, morbidity and transmission of the microorganism will increase due to the patients remain infectious for a long period. Increased morbidity and mortality was documented in several cases including streptococcal infection (77). A study in France has estimated that 158,000 infections due to multidrug-resistant microorganisms occurred in 2012, including 12,500 deaths were associated with these infections (77).

In addition to this costs, the costs of the efforts and studies to eradicate the anti-microbial resistance from health care centres.
