The density of services is higher in the north of the country, including Lombardy, where the main COVID-19 outbreak began, than in the south. There is a long tradition of hospice and palliative care: the European Association for Palliative Care (EAPC) was founded in Italy in 1988. There are however few academic positions and little education in medical schools. The EAPC 2019 Atlas of Palliative Care recorded that 0 of 43 medical schools and only 98 of 222 nursing schools provided palliative care education within their undergraduate programmes.5",

While all hospices in our survey had written guidance on procedures for suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19, this was mostly regionally or nationally provided and no hospice had setting-specific guidance. There was considerable variation in the use of barrier precautions and personal protective equipment, which were described as scarce. There was also wide variation in perceptions of anxiety and the risk of illness among staff. This may indicate that more and urgent education is needed to inform hospice staff about reducing risks of COVID-19 infection. Protection of health care professionals across all settings against COVID-19 through use of appropriate barrier precautions should be of the highest priority, to avoid illness and mitigate against psychological distress.1 National and international guidance and evidence regarding personal protective equipment has been evolving since the start of this pandemic. A recent rapid review concluded that the best evidence was that \u2018Suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19 requiring healthcare facility admission and no [aerosol generating procedures] AGPs, use hand hygiene, mask, gown, goggles, gloves\u2019. This review noted that masks are one component of protection.

Hospices responded to this challenge through rapid changes to service provision. For example one hospice had implemented daily telephone calls to relatives who were unable to visit, which might mitigate against the \u2018disruption in connectedness\u2019 described following the 2003 SARS epidemic in Singapore.7 Another hospice had moved staff from inpatient to home care services as a result of a falling number of inpatient referrals. Changes in inpatient hospice utilisation in Taiwan were identified during and after the SARS epidemic and led to recommendations to distribute hospice care services into networks (e.g. home care, acute hospital inpatient care and inpatient hospice care) that can adapt to changing needs.4 The concern regarding palliative care for many patients who the services could not reach was a pervading theme, as seen in the other comments. The engagement of palliative care in intensive care can be complex, often because of the uncertainly in outcome and the rapidly changing situation.8 To date, attention has focussed on tools and integrated working to support patients and families in intensive care unit (ICU).9,10",

We chose purposive sampling as this is known to be very useful in situations when a targeted sample is needed quickly, and where sampling for proportionality is not the main concern, as in the context of rapid spread of COVID-19 and a lack of information on the hospice response. Although it would have been useful to have had a larger sample, we reached saturation of themes. However, a larger sample might have identified more examples of innovate practice. The opportunity to collect in-depth qualitative data was limited due to the extreme pressure services are under. It will be useful to follow up this cross-sectional survey over time, and with a larger sample, as the situation changes. Using our existing clinical-academic networks enabled this survey to be completed rapidly, to provide essential early data of the hospice response.",

Hospices are known to provide support with complex decisions and triage, psychological support for patients, carers and professionals, and complex symptom management, particularly for people who are dying.3 However, in our study we found that procedures had mainly focussed on the notification regarding positive COVID-19 cases, rather than on the contribution of hospices to care. There is other evidence that the hospice sector is underused in epidemics.4 In Italy, and elsewhere, it is likely that the number of people dying with COVID-19 will overwhelm the capacity of the acute sector.11 Integrating hospice and palliative care into the acute pandemic response may improve the care and symptom management for people who are deteriorating and at the end of life, as well as helping in the overall effort to optimise survival of others.12",

Our survey demonstrates that the hospice sector is able to respond flexibly and rapidly to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the potential of hospices in supporting the COVID-19 pandemic will be undermined unless the sector has access to appropriate protective equipment and setting-specific guidance. Governments must urgently recognise the necessity of hospice and palliative care to the COVID-19 pandemic and ensure these services are both protected and integrated into the health care system response. Hospices may also need to reach out to offer support in creative ways during the response.",
