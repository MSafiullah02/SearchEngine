To facilitate the studies on the function and structure of the N protein, this report describe the expression and purification of recombinant SARS-CoV N protein using the baculovirus expression system. Recombinant hexa-histidine-tagged N protein with a molecular mass of 47 kD was produced in insect cells. Recombinant N protein was purified to near homogeneity by Ni 2+ -NTA affinity chromatography. In addition, we examined the subcellular localization of the N protein by confocal microscopy in Trichoplusia ni BT1 Tn 5B1-4 cells infected with recombinant baculovirus. The N protein was found localized in the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleolus. The purified recombinant N protein can be used in further functional study of SARS-CoV.",

Clinical diagnose asserted the sensitivity and the specificity of SARS IgG serologic test [4] [5] [6] . Some antigenic peptides of the SARS-CoV N protein can be recognized by T-cells on the surface of infected cells [7] , suggesting an intriguing role of the N protein in the generation of primary humoral immune response against SARS-CoV infection. A recent study showed DNA vaccines containing the N protein expression cassettes were capable of generating strong N-specific humoral and cellular immune responses and might potentially be useful in the control of infection by 9] .

These properties may play an important role in exerting biology functions [22] . The N protein of other coronaviruses are involved in the formation of viral capsid, the transcriptional regulation of viral genome, and the packaging of viral RNA. Present report showed that the N protein of SARS-CoV selectively activated the AP-1 pathway [18] , induced apoptosis in COS-1 cells in the absence of growth factors [24] and interaction with membrane protein of the SARS-CoV [25] . Analysis of the structure and function of the SARS-CoV N protein will be beneficial for the understanding of the life cycle and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV. The purified recombinant N protein will be a valuable tool in the further functional study of SARS-CoV.",

However, the serologic diagnosis remains an indispensable means for confirming viral infection status. The study of Paul et al. [4] indicated that an infected cell-base indirect immunoflurescence test for anti-SARS IgG antibody was sensitive and specific. ELISA based on the purified recombinant SARS-CoV N protein from bacteria expression system has high sensitivity and specificity [1] . These studies indicate that recombinant N protein holds a significant value for SARS diagnosis. Some researches show that when a recombinant protein is produced for antibody determination, the influence of the expression system is a major variable since it may affect the sensitivity and specificity of the serologic assay [20, 21] . The purified protein in this study can be used to compare with the prokaryotic recombinant N protein in the antigenic activity to optimize diagnostic methods. In baculovirus expression system, recombinant protein is processed, modified, and targeted to its appropriate subcellular location, where usually reflects its original location [22] . The SARS-CoV N protein contains a putative nuclear localization signal (KKDKKKK, amino acid 370-376). We used recombinant baculovirus to infect Tn cells to study the localization of the SARS-CoV N protein.",
