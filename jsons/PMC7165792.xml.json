Briefly, the case definition was: fever of 38\u00b0 C or higher, cough or difficulty breathing, radiographic evidence of infiltrates consistent with pneumonia or respiratory distress syndrome, and either a history of exposure to a patient with SARS or a lack of response to empirical antimicrobial coverage for typical and atypical pneumonia. After informed consent was obtained from each patient, percutaneous liver biopsy was performed to look for the cause of elevated liver enzymes. Common causes of hepatitis were excluded by serologic tests, including anti\u2013hepatitis A virus IgM antibodies, anti\u2013hepatitis B core IgM, hepatitis B surface antigen, anti\u2013hepatitis C antibody, and cytomegalovirus pp65 antigen. Abdominal ultrasonography was performed to rule out space\u2010occupying lesions and biliary tract diseases. All patients received antimicrobial coverage for community\u2010acquired pneumonia with ceftriaxone and clarithromycin or levofloxacin alone. Combination therapy using oral ribavirin 600 mg twice daily and Kaletra (lopinavir/ritonavir, Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL) 1000 mg daily were commenced when patients did not respond to antibiotics within 48 hours. Kaletra is a co\u2010formulation of two protease inhibitors: lopinavir and ritonavir. It is an experimental drug for coronavirus that depends on protease for cleavage of polypeptides and formation of viral structure. Methylprednisolone, given in three pulses at a dose of 500 mg to 1000 mg daily, was offered to patients who had persistent fever, radiologic progression of lung infiltrates, or signs of respiratory distress despite antiviral therapy.",

Two 1\u2010mm tissue fragments were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde for transmission electron microscopy examination. A 5\u2010mm\u2010long tissue was immediately kept frozen at \u221270\u00b0 C for molecular study. The remaining core of tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. The paraffin\u2010embedded blocks of liver tissues were sectioned at 4 \u03bcm for light microscopy. A panel of stains including hematoxylin and eosin, diastase periodic acid\u2010schiff, Perls, Gordon and Sweets' reticulin, and Orcein were performed. The number of mitoses was counted in 1000 hepatocytes in each specimen, and the mitotic index was expressed as the percentage. Immunohistochemical study for Ki\u201067 antigen (DAKO rabbit antihuman Ki\u201067 antigen, code no. A047) was performed using the BIOTEK TM500\u2010220 automated immunohistochemical stainer (DAKO, CA, USA). Ki\u201067 is a human nuclear antigen that is expressed during G1, S, G2, and M phases of the cell cycle but is absent in the quiescent G0 phase.8 Proliferating hepatocytes were identified by immunohistochemical staining of Ki\u201067. Only hepatocytes with distinct and near\u2010total nuclear staining were considered positive. One thousand hepatocytes were counted in each specimen. The Ki\u201067 index was expressed as percentage of hepatocyte nuclei that showed positive staining pattern. Immunostaining for cytomegalovirus (CMV) using monoclonal mouse anti\u2010cytomegalovirus antibodies (DAKO\u2010CMV DDG9, CCH2, code no. M854) was also performed to exclude CMV infection.",

Phylogenetic analyses and sequence comparisons show that it is not closely related to other known coronaviruses, including two human coronaviruses, HCoV\u2010OC43 and HCoV\u2010229E.10, 11 Disease spectrum related to this novel coronavirus and its pathogenesis have yet to be explored. Other members of the genus Coronavirus (e.g., mouse hepatitis virus, which is a group 2 coronavirus) can cause liver damage ranging from minimal changes to fulminant hepatitis.12, 13, 14, 15 The spike protein found on the virion envelope and on the plasma membrane of infected cells is responsible for attachment to viral receptor and virus\u2013cell fusion during viral entry and for cell\u2010to\u2010cell fusion during the latter stages of the infection.16, 17 Studies of mouse hepatitis virus showed that the spike gene determined the viral load in the liver and that the amount of antigen staining and necrosis in the liver correlated with the viral load. Mutation in the spike gene might abbreviate the severity of hepatitis.18 Pairwise amino acid identity between SARS\u2010coronavirus and other known coronaviruses was less than 30%,11 hence the hepatotropism of this novel coronavirus is unpredictable.",

The diagnosis was supported by laboratory tests, including (1) a fourfold or greater rise in antibody titer between acute and convalescent phase sera tested in parallel in patients 1 and 2 and (2) PCR positive for SARS\u2010CoV in a stool specimen of patient 2 and nasopharyngeal aspirate of patient 3, respectively. In our three SARS patients with moderate to marked elevation of ALT, prominent mitoses, acidophilic bodies, Kupffer cells, and mild to moderate lobular inflammation were the common histologic features. All of our patients showed positive RT\u2010PCR for SARS\u2010CoV in liver tissue but not in the sera, suggesting that the virus was localized in liver. Indeed, SARS\u2010CoV is detectable in less than 50% of sera of SARS patients beyond 14 days after fever onset.19 Because ribavirin and Kaletra were given to all three patients prior to liver biopsy, viral replication might possibly be suppressed and hence no virus could be identified by electron microscopy. Alternatively, the viral load in liver may be so low that it would be difficult to be observed ultrastructurally. The only report of liver histology in SARS (other than the present study) was an autopsy showing microvesicular fatty change, focal hemorrhages, and hepatocyte necrosis with scattered acidophilic bodies in liver, but no viral inclusions were observed.20 Because that patient developed respiratory failure and multi\u2010organ failure before death, the changes in liver histology might not be solely due to SARS\u2010CoV infection.",

Immunohistochemical study using Ki\u201067 stain showed that hepatocytes were highly replicative. Ki\u201067 proliferative index has also been reported as 0.4% to 1% in chronic active hepatitis C,8, 21, 22 but the index for acute viral hepatitis remains unknown. However, hepatocytes in the mitotic phase are uncommonly seen even in acute or chronic hepatitis and liver cirrhosis even when regeneration takes place rapidly.23 The finding of conspicious mitoses in our patients appears out of proportion to the extent of liver cell damage as assessed biochemically or histologically. The possibility of cell cycle disruption caused by coronavirus should be considered. Studies of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (a group 1 coronavirus) and mouse hepatitis virus showed that nucleolar localization of nucleoprotein (N protein) is a common feature of the coronavirus family, and about 30% of Vero cells transfected with the nucleoprotein appear to undergo cell division.24 This observation has also been reported in the avian infectious bronchitis virus (a group 3 coronavirus).25 A delay in mitosis or inhibition of cytokinesis could lead to an accumulation of cells in the M phase of the cell cycle and hence the appearance that a significant number of cells undergo cell division. Unlike patients 1 and 2, patient 3 had negative serology for SARS\u2010CoV despite repeatedly positive RT\u2010PCR results on nasal and throat swabs and liver tissue. The lack of immunoglobulin G seroconversion has been described in up to 7% of patients with SARS.7 The liver biopsy of this patient also showed higher lobular activities and less prominent mitotic figures, which might represent another spectrum of disease as a result of different host response to the virus.",

Studies show that some coronaviruses exert extensive cytopathic effect through the induction of apoptosis of their host cells by caspase activation.27, 28 Mouse hepatitis virus can also activate the immune coagulation system by the fgl2 gene, which encodes a specific prothrombinase. It induces macrophage procoagulant activity,29 which in turn leads to fibrin deposition on the endothelium of intrahepatic veins and hepatic sinusoids resulting in confluent hepatocellular necrosis. However, our specimens did not show any sinusoidal dilatation or fibrin deposition on the hepatic veins.

Kaletra has been used for the treatment of SARS in more than 100 patients in Hong Kong. Preliminary results show that 30\u2010day mortality and intubation rates are lower in the Kaletra\u2010treated group compared with patients treated with ribavirin.31 Elevation in ALT greater than fivefold the upper limit of normal has been reported in 3% to 11% of patients taking Kaletra.32 Ribavirin also increases mitochondrial toxicity in HIV\u2010infected patients treated with protease inhibitors.33, 34 However, we do not favor this possibility, because hepatotoxicity usually develops only after long\u2010term use of antiviral agents. Furthermore, our patients had no pancreatitis, myopathy, lactic acidosis, or other clinical features suggestive of mitochondrial toxicity. Occasionally, hepatotoxicity may occur in the first few weeks after initiating antiviral therapy; this is typically related to immune\u2010mediated hypersensitivity and generally occurs in conjunction with allergic reactions such as fever and rash.35 However, our patients had no such clinical features, and their liver biopsies did not show any eosinophilia, giant mitochondria, or microvesicular steatosis suggestive of drug toxicity.36, 37, 38, 39 Furthermore, there is no consistent temporal relationship between the antiviral treatment and liver function impairment. In primary human hepatocytes, ribavirin can also inhibit cell proliferation induced by mitogenic factors by way of a delayed progression to the S phase of the cell cycle.40 However, liver histology of patients with chronic hepatitis C does not show any features of cell cycle arrest after ribavirin monotherapy.41, 42 Further studies are warranted to determine whether or not SARS\u2010CoV infection, like chronic hepatitis B and C virus infection,43, 44, 45 may increase the hepatotoxicity of the antivirals.",
