With a huge number of asymptomatic potential virus carriers, the initial policy of home isolation was not sufficiently effective and was complicated by growing fear and helplessness. Chen Wang, current president of the Chinese Association of Chest Physicians and former president of the CTS, initiated the construction of converted hospitals for the purpose of isolation and monitoring. Large public venues such as stadiums and college/school dorms were converted into preliminary medical facilities to admit suspected carriers and verified patients who remained asymptomatic or only mildly symptomatic. The facilities were named Fang Cang hospitals, a name derived from the concept of military container shelters. The goal was to admit at the earliest time all those who should be isolated or monitored. Within a matter of days, 16 such facilities were functioning at capacity, with 13,000 admissions in Wuhan alone. The facilities are staffed with medical professionals who can identify clinical deterioration at the earliest stage and immediately begin necessary responses, including initiating transfers to higher level hospitals designated for treating COVID-19. Supplies are provided by government agents, and daily activities of the inpatients are organized to minimize psychological stress. The establishment of Fang Cang hospitals is the crucial measure that has begun to curb the rapidly uprising trend in the curve of accumulated cases.",
