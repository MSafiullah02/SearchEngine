Quasispecies has become very important in virology because it provides an interpretation for the extensive plasticity, both genetic and phenotypic (of biological features), displayed by many viruses, in particular RNA viruses. The quasispecies concept originated in theoretical studies on early informational macromolecules by Eigen and colleagues, and in experimental work on bacteriophage Q\u03b2 by Weissmann and colleagues. Eigen was the first to elaborate a quantitative treatment of the generation of error copies of simple replicating molecules (replicons) as those that probably populated the earth at the early stages of life. This treatment represented a link between principles of information theory and Darwinian evolutionary concepts, and was inspired to a great extent by experiments on evolution of simple RNA molecules replicating in vitro carried out by Spiegelman and his associates in the 1960s.",

It represents a rated distribution of mutants (mutant spectrum) centered around one or several master sequences (Table 1\nand Fig. 1\n). The copying fidelity with which replication occurs determines the fraction of progeny molecules which will be identical to the parental replicon.\nThis theoretical concept assumes a selection equilibrium in the distribution whose evolution can be described by a system of ordinary differential equations. This selection equilibrium is metastable in that it will collapse when an advantageous mutant appears in the distribution. The previous quasispecies will then be substituted by a new one, characterized by a new master sequence and a new mutant spectrum. The stability of a quasispecies depends on the complexity of the genetic information contained in the genome, the copying fidelity and the superiority of the master sequence. This is expressed mathematically in an error threshold relationship which limits the amount of genetic information that can be transmited when copying fidelity is limited (Table 1.",

Viral quasispecies can be viewed as clouds that occupy tiny portions of such theoretical space. Occupation of sequence space by viruses is restricted by multiple genetic and functional constraints. The clouds have, at any given time, a defined population structure dependent on the distance of each point to the consensus sequence (that could be taken as the center of the distribution), and on the relative fitness values of the different mutant components. The distance or number of mutated positions between a given sequence and the best adapted one (the master sequence) is called the Hamming distance.

It had long been suspected that RNA viruses were genetically unstable, as suggested by the abundance of mutants in viral stocks and by the difficulty of maintaining some mutants (conditional lethal, plaque-type) free of wild-type revertants. The first evidence that an RNA virus depicted features of quasispecies was obtained by Weissmann and associates in Z\u00fcrich working with bacteriophage Q\u03b2. Upon replication in its host Escherichia coli, a clone of bacteriophage Q\u03b2 generated error copies with high frequency. Quantification of the reversion of a site-specific mutant, and of its growth rate relative to the parental wild-type Q\u03b2, allowed an estimate of the mutation rate for a specific purine transition: about 10\u22124 per round of copying, a value about 105-fold larger than that estimated for the mutation rate of DNA genomes. Furthermore, genomic RNA from many phage clones was analyzed by T1-oligonucleotide fingerprinting (rapid nucleotide sequencing techniques were not yet available). The results indicated that, assuming a random distribution of mutations among the genomes analyzed, each infectious RNA differed in 1\u20132 positions from the average or consensus sequence in the population. Interestingly, the T1-oligonucleotide map of the RNA from the uncloned phage population remained unchanged during 50 serial infections, a fact that must be kept in mind before considering stability of a consensus sequence as evidence against quasispecies. A highly dynamic mutant spectrum can nevertheless produce the same average sequence over many generations of viral replication. Weissmann and colleagues concluded that: \u2018The genome of Q\u03b2 phage cannot be described as a defined unique structure, but rather as a weighted average of a large number of different individual sequences.\u2019",

            "text": "Real virus quasispecies, such as those replicating in the course of acute or chronic infections of differentiated organisms, are permanently perturbed by a complicated array of environmental influences.\nOne is compartmentalization of virus replication within infected organisms: viruses may replicate in disparate cell types, such as epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract, lymphocytes or brain cells. Different sites within an infected organism will be subjected to different kinds of selective pressures derived either from variations in the internal environment (immune responses, metabolic or nutritional alterations, temperature, etc.) or from externally applied influences such as the presence of antiviral agents. Competition among components of the mutant spectrum will be established within each infected cell. Virus progeny from different cells may engage in subsequent rounds of competition (for entry into target cells, for effective replication, etc.). Such rating events may involve many genomes in the case of acute, systemic infections in which viruses may reach up to 1012 infectious units at a given time in the entire organism, and viral RNA loads composed of infectious and noninfectious genomes may reach exceedingly high levels. Evolving mutant distributions are easily shaped by selective forces and perturbed by random sampling events (Fig. 1), providing a genetic flexibility that could not be reached if mutations were rare events. Adaptability is facilitated by the limited genome size (generally between 3 \u00d7 103 and 3 \u00d7 104 nucleotides) and large population numbers. All possible single and double mutants, and decreasing proportions of triple, quadruple, etc. mutants are potentially present in many viral populations. In contrast, only a minute fraction of all possible single mutants is present at any given time in populations of cellular organisms. That is, the ability to explore their allotted share of sequence space is vastly superior for small, abundant replicons than for complex DNA genomes. Furthermore, one or a few nucleotide (or amino acid) replacements are often sufficient to trigger biologically relevant changes (alterations in cell tropism, virulence, escape from immune surveillance, resistance to antiviral inhibitors, etc.). Variant genomes with few mutations have a high probability of occurrence within the mutant spectra of evolving quasispecies. Of course, clouds of mutants are far from being symmetrical, as even single point mutants may have reduced fitness and may not be represented, or represented with low frequency, in the mutant spectra. Mathematical extensions of the initial theoretical quasispecies concept have been developed to cope with some of the perturbations undergone by real virus quasispecies; however, such treatments are complex and difficult to apply to experimental observations with viruses.",

Beck, Levander and associates described that an avirulent coxsackievirus B3 became cardiopathic upon replication in selenium- or vitamin E-deficient mice, as a result of repeated selection of six specific mutations scattered along the viral genome. It is likely that such a phenotypic modification was facilitated by the impaired immune responses, and the larger ensuing viral loads, in infected hosts bearing some nutritional deficiencies. Chumakov and colleagues quantitated the presence of virulent poliovirus in the mutant spectrum of attenuated poliovirus used for vaccine preparation. When the proportion of virulent poliovirus variants in the vaccine exceeded a certain value, the virulent phenotype was manifested and the vaccine failed the safety tests in monkeys. This, and additional results with other viral systems, have established that expression of a variant phenotype encoded in a subset of genomes from the mutant spectrum depends on their proportion in the mutant distribution. These results agree with theoretical predictions on the behaviour of viral quasispecies in that the fate of each individual component of the mutant spectrum is strongly dependent on the mutant cloud surrounding it.",

Model experiments with the animal pathogen foot-and-mouth disease virus showed that indeed the repertoire of viral mutants that became dominant in an evolving quasispecies depended on the population size of the virus.

However, in a rather unpredictable manner, one of the clones abruptly displaced the other and became dominant in the population. This observation agrees with the competitive exclusion principle of population genetics that states that unless there is a niche differentiation, one of two competing species will eventually outcompete the other. In such competitions both the winners and the losers gained fitness in such a manner that their relative position in the fitness landscape was similar at the end and at the start of the competition.
