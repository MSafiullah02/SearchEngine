This funding supported the establishment and enhancement of influenza surveillance and laboratory detection across the Region, and technical support, assistance and guidance to member states were provided by the WHO Regional Office. This programme was extended for another five-year period in 2011, with a primary focus on strengthening capacity in three areas-(1) to enhance epidemiological and virological surveillance of influenza, (2) to estimate the disease burden associated with influenza, and (3) to support policies to introduce and increase the use of seasonal influenza vaccines. The programme\u2019s objectives stemmed from the rationale that those countries with strong influenza surveillance and vaccine programmes would be better prepared to respond to an influenza pandemic. Building on the success of the first five-year period of improving influenza surveillance in WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region during 2006\u20132011, the second five-year period between 2011 and 2016 saw further improvements in all three areas of enhancing influenza surveillance, estimating disease burden and use of influenza surveillance data to develop informed policies and strategies for control of influenza. The funding support to seven priorities countries via the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework (PIP) in 2014 greatly supplemented the ongoing works of the Regional Office and spurred the momentum that already generated through the support of US CDC to strengthen influenza surveillance programme in the Region.",

Using these data, we calculated the increase in the total number of sentinel sites across the region between 2011 and 2018. We also calculated the change in the number of severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) detected and reported to FluID and EMFLU in each year by the countries between 2011 and 2018. The increase in number, wherever reported and evidenced, was used as an indication of improvement in influenza surveillance system in the Region as a whole. We also accessed regional data from FluNet for 16 national influenza centres (NICs) for analysis and calculated the change in the total number of specimens processed and tested annually between 2011 and 2018. Lastly, in order to measure the capacity in the Region to detect, test and ship influenza specimens, we calculated the change in the number of specimens shared with the WHO Collaborating Centres for the bi-annual vaccine strain selection.",

We interpreted that any participating NIC that scored 90% on all efficiency panels indicated progress made in the quality of influenza testing.
