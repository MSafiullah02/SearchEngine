In humans, viruses are known to cause infectious diseases such as influenza, hepatitis, AIDS, diarrhoea, encephalitis, dengue fever and, more recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Ebola (Singh et al. 2017a), Zika (Singh et al. 2017b), etc. Despite the vaccines and treatments for such diseases, morbidity and mortality both occur as a result of the viral infections. Viral disease of animals not only affects the production but also is a threat to humans (Saminathan et al. 2016). A rapid growth in the availability of sequencing methods and a vast amount of viral sequence data have been generated during recent times. Thus, it is imperative to decipher this data using more advanced tools such as bioinformatics resources. A large number of bioinformatics tools that can aid in the analysis of viral genomes and develop preventive and therapeutic strategies have been developed for human as well as animal viruses. This chapter will introduce virologists to some of the common as well virus-specific bioinformatics tools that the researches can use to analyse viral sequence data to elucidate the viral dynamics, evolution and preventive therapeutics.",

            "text": "An open reading frame (ORF) is the part of genome that translates into a protein. Finding ORF is one of the key steps in viral genome analysis. It forms the basis for further analysis such as homologous search, predicting proteins, functional analysis and viral vaccine and antiviral target discovery. If an ORF translates a surface protein that is unique to that virus, it may elicit immune responses and could potentially be a vaccine candidate. ORF Finder by NCBI is a ORF prediction program (Rombel et al. 2002). The program outputs a range of each ORFs along with its protein translation in six possible reading frames from the input DNA sequence. It can be used to search newly sequenced DNA for potential protein encoding sequences and to verify predicted proteins using SMART BLAST or BLASTP (Altschul et al. 1990). However, the web version of the program is limited to a query sequence length of 50 kb only. A standalone system has no limitation on length but is available only for the Linux 64 operating system. NEG8, a 167-codon novel ORF in segment 8 of influenza virus, was visualized using ORF Finder (Clifford et al. 2009). Using the ORF Finder in association with the basic local alignment search tool BLAST, 154 ORFs were found in the Hz-1 virus genome (Cheng et al. 2002). Due to small genome size, viruses employ multiple strategies to maximize the coding potential including frameshifts and alternative codon usage. Thus, virus-specific programs have been developed to overcome these challenges. GeneMark (http://opal.biology.gatech.edu/GeneMark/genemarks.cgi) provides gene prediction tools for viruses (Besemer and Borodovsky 2005). Viral genome organizer (VGO) \u2013 a Java-based web tool \u2013 offers identification of gene and ORF identification in viral sequences (Upton et al. 2000).",

            "text": "Identification of immune epitopes is important in designing new vaccine candidates and in diagnostics. An epitope is the part of an antigen that is recognized by the receptors of immune system components such as antibodies, B cells or T cells. Epitopes have been generally classified as either linear or conformational epitopes. T cells recognize linear epitopes, short continuous strings of amino acids derived from protein antigen, presented with MHC class I molecules. B cells and antibodies, on the other hand, recognize conformational epitopes which are formed by interactions of amino acids with multiple discontinuous segments forming a three-dimensional antigen (Barlow et al. 1986). Owing to the simple linear structure of T cell epitopes, their interaction with receptors can be modelled with high accuracy (DeLisi and Berzofsky 1985). A large number of prediction databases and servers thus are available for linear epitope prediction. MHCPEP (Brusic et al. 1998), SYFPEITHI (Rammensee et al. 1999), FIMM (Schonbach et al. 2005), MHCBN (Bhasin et al. 2003) and EPIMHC (Reche et al. 2005) are some of the commonly used T cell epitope prediction programs. Immune epitope database and analysis resource (https://www.iedb.org) (Vita et al. 2015) offers the most comprehensive set of tools for epitope analysis for epitope prediction covering HLA-A and HLA-B for humans as well as chimpanzee, macaque, gorilla, cow, pig and mouse and is one of the few databases that cover such a variety of organisms. Since 2011, IEDB uses NetMHCpan as prediction method. NetMHC server uses the artificial neural network method to predict binding of peptides to different alleles from human as well as 41 animals including cattle and pig (38 from core). The database also contains curated data for many viruses including influenza and herpesviruses. B cell receptors and epitope interactions are more complex in nature than the linear epitopes for T cells; thus, accuracy of B cell epitopes is relatively low. Furthermore, most of the current databases are centred on linear rather than conformational epitopes. Bcipep is a tool developed for predicting the linear epitope of B cells (Saha et al. 2005). Epitome is a database of structure-inferred antigenic residues in proteins (Schlessinger et al. 2006). Epitome is especially useful in the prediction of antibody-antigen complex interaction. The database is available at http://www.rostlab.org/services/epitome/. AntiJen is an intricate database with entries on both T cell and B cell epitopes. It emphasizes on integration of kinetic, thermodynamic, functional and cellular data within the context of immunology and vaccinology (Toseland et al. 2005) (Fig. 23.1a).",

Such structural modelling tools may be implicated to identify and design novel candidates for antiviral inhibitors and vaccine targets. Secondary structures may be predicted using the tool PredictProtein (http://www.predictprotein.org/) (Rost et al. 2004). Using this online tool, along with secondary structures, solvent accessibility and possible transmembrane helices can be predicted. Further, it also provides expected accuracy of prediction methods. SWISS-MODEL (http://swissmodel.expasy.org/) is a popular tool for the prediction of a 3-D structure of a protein. 3-D structure prediction programs usually employ homology searching using similar and known protein structures as templates. One of the most commonly used database for such templates is Protein Data Bank (PDB) (Reddy et al. 2001). Output from the SWISS-MODEL program includes the template selected, alignment between the query sequence and the template, and the predicted 3-D model. Results of SWISS-MODEL are, however, only sent by email (Figs. 23.1b, 23.1c, 23.1d and 23.1e).",

Another downloadable web server tool, ViroBLAST, is an exclusive BLAST tool that can be used for queries against multiple databases (Deng et al. 2007). Sequences from a variety of viral strains can be analysed simultaneously using the Alvira software, which is a multiple sequence alignment tool that provides graphical representation as well (Enault et al. 2007). Furthermore, comparative analysis of genes and genomes of coronavirus can be carried out by using the CoVDB (coronavirus database) (Huang et al. 2008).",

            "text": "The digital resource ViralZone is designed specifically to comprehend viral diversity and acquire information on viral molecular biology, hosts, taxonomy, epidemiology and structures (Hulo et al. 2011). The Simmonics program was upgraded to the simple sequence editor (SSE) software package, wherein the user-given sequences can be aligned and annotated and further can be analysed for diversity and phylogeny (Simmonds 2012). Evolutionary changes in viral genome lead to polymorphisms in their proteins, which in turn result into changes in viral phenotype such as viral virulence, viral-host interactions, etc. The digital database, ViralORFeome, not only stores all variants and mutants of viral ORFS, but also provides tools to design ORF-specific cloning primers (Pellet et al. 2010). Further, degenerate primer pairs can be selected and matched to amplify user-defined viral genomes using the online tool PriSM (Yu et al. 2011). The recent advances in next-generation sequencing and technologies have facilitated to study viral population at an advanced level. The viral population biodiversity and dynamics can be studied using the first such tool developed, PHACCS (Phage Communities from Contig Spectrum), that can analyse the shotgun sequence data to estimate the structure and diversity of phages (Angly et al. 2005). Later on, more tools/resources were developed to analyse viral metagenomics sequences, such as Viral Informatics Resource for Metagenomic Exploration (VIROME), Viral MetaGenome Annotation Pipeline (VMGAP) and Metavir (Lorenzi et al. 2011, Roux et al. 2011, Wommack et al. 2012). Novel viruses can be identified from a pool of specimen types using a specific computational pipeline, VirusHunter (Zhao et al. 2013).",

            "text": "The phenomenon of genetic recombination in viruses is responsible for the emergence of new viruses, increased virulence and host range, immune evasion and development of antiviral resistance. This distinct process of viral recombination can be detected by two bioinformatics tools, viz. jpHMM (Jumping Profile Hidden Markov Model) and ViReMa (Virus Recombination Mapper) genomes (Schultz et al. 2009; Routh and Johnson 2014). The jpHMM, a web server, can be used for predicting recombination in HIV-1 and HBV, whereas ViReMa, a downloadable software, can be used to analyse next-generation sequencing data. Additionally, another software called VIPR HMM (Viral Identification with a PRobabilistic algorithm incorporating hidden Markov model) can detect recombinant and non-recombinant viruses using microbial detection microarrays (Allred et al. 2012). Further, viral genome sequences can be searched for degenerate locus of recombination (lox)-like sites by a web server called SeLOX (Surendranath et al. 2010). A downloadable software, VIRAPOPS, is a forward simulator that allows simulation of RNA virus population (Petitjean and Vanet 2014). With this software, the drastic changes in rapidly evolving RNA viruses such as mutability, recombination, variation, covariation, etc. can be simulated to predict their effects on viral populations. SeqMap is a tool capable of identifying viral integration sites (VIS) from ligation-mediated PCR (LM-PCR), linear amplification-mediated PCR (LAM-PCR) and nonrestrictive LAM-PCR (nrLAM-PCR) reactions and mapping short sequences to the genome (Hawkins et al. 2011). Further, VIS can also be detected by three more distinct tools, VirusSeq, ViralFusionSeq, and VirusFinder (Chen et al. 2013, Li et al. 2013, Wang et al. 2013). For more precise VIS prediction, all four tools can be employed by virologists.",

With VIGOR, based on sequence similarity searches, users are able to predict protein coding regions, start and stop codons and other complex gene features such as RNA editing, stop codon leakage and ribosomal shunting. Further, various features such as frameshifts, overlapping genes, embedded genes, etc. can be predicted in the virus genome. Additionally, a mature peptide can be predicted in a given polypeptide open reading frame. VIGOR is also capable of genotyping influenza virus and rotavirus. Four output files \u2013 a gene prediction file, a complementary DNA file, an alignment file, and a gene feature table file \u2013 are produced by VIGOR.

The homologous proteins in VIDA include both orthologous and paralogous sequences. VIDA retrieves virus sequences from GenBank and the files are parsed into subfields. The parsed fields contain all the information such as GenBank accession number, GenBank identifier (GI numbers), protein sequence source, sequence length, gene name and gene product. In order to eliminate 100% redundancy, the virus protein sequences thus retrieved are filtered and a list of synonymous GIs is created for reference. The ORFs from complete and partial virus genomes are further organized into homologous protein families, on the basis of sequence similarity. Furthermore, the structure of known viral proteins or homologous to viral proteins is also mapped onto homologous protein families. VIDA also provides functional classification of virus proteins into broad functional classes based on typical virus processes such as DNA and RNA replication, virus structural proteins, nucleotide and nucleic acid metabolism, transcription, glycoproteins and others. This database also provides alignment of the conserved regions based on potential functional importance. Apart from functional classification, VIDA also provides a taxonomical classification of the proteins and protein families.

IRD provides tools for genomic and proteomic intervention, immune epitope prediction and surveillance data for viral nucleotide sequences (Squires et al. 2012). Furthermore, this resource is also equipped with tools that provide insight into host-pathogen interactions, type of virulence, host range and a correlation of sequence variation and these processes. There are other repositories available: Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) consortium that mediated the EpiFlu database and FluGenome database that exclusively provides genotyping of influenza A virus and aids in detecting reassortments taking place in divergent lines (Lu et al. 2007). Furthermore, reassortment events in influenza viruses exclusively can be identified by a program GiRaF (Graph-incompatibility-based Reassortment Finder) that can be downloaded (Nagarajan and Kingsford 2011). Another distinct repository, Influenza Sequence and Epitope Database (ISED), provides viral sequences and epitopes from Asian countries; the information could be exploited to understand and study evolutionary divergence and migration of strains (Yang et al. 2009). The web server ATIVS (Analytical Tool for Influenza Virus Surveillance) provides an antigenic map for conducting surveillance and selection of vaccine strains by scrutinizing the serological data of haemagglutinin sequence data of influenza A/H3N2 viruses and influenza subtypes (Liao et al. 2009). There is another online repository OpenFluDB (an isolate-centred inventory), where information of an isolate such as virus type, host, date of isolation, geographical distribution, predicted antiviral resistance, enhanced pathogenicity or human adaptation propensity may be obtained (Liechti et al. 2010). For influenza viruses, primers and probes can be designed using the Influenza Primer Design Resource (IPDR) (Bose et al. 2008). Further, prospective influenza seasonal epidemics or pandemics can be predicted using a stochastic model, FluTE (Chao et al. 2010) (Table 23.2).",

In recent years, extensive research efforts have been done for the development of live, orally administered vaccines. In India, an orally administered vaccine ROTAVAC was also introduced after successful clinical trials in 2014 which became available to clinicians in 2016, although these vaccines will have to be scrutinized and have to be updated regularly to accommodate the emerging rotavirus genotype variations, following which molecular and genetic characterization of new circulating and emerging genotypes of rotavirus strains in humans and animals becomes necessary. Recently, a classification system for RVAs has been described by the Rotavirus Classification Working Group (RCWG) in which all the 11 genomic RNA segments are assigned a particular alphabet followed by the particular genotype number. The classification system will be helpful in explaining the importance of genetic reassortments among RVAs, host range, transfer of gene segments among two different genotypes and adaptation to different hosts. To differentiate between different gene segments of RVAs, an online web-based tool RotaC was developed by the leading researchers from Rega Institute, KU Leuven, Belgium, in 2009 (Table 23.3). It\u2019s an easy-to-use and reliable classification tool for RVAs and works on the agreement with RCWG. It\u2019s a platform-independent tool which works on any web browser by simply going to its URL (http://rotac.regatools.be/) and has been released without any restriction of use by academicians or anyone else. As claimed, the RotaC web-based tool will be updated regularly to reflect the established as well as newly emerging genotypes announced by the RCWG from time to time.",

Application of such tools for studying animal viruses or animal diseases, in many situations, may not be as accurate as with specialized tools. The users should take precautions while using the settings of such tools. Furthermore, the results, thus obtained, also need to be scrutinized.
