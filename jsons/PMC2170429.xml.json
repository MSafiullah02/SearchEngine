Alveolar type I cells, which make up 95% of this surface area, are terminally differentiated and function in gas exchange and fluid homeostasis (Williams, 2003). Alveolar type II cells are dividing cells that transdifferentiate in vivo into the type I cell phenotype during the repair of damaged alveolar epithelium. Type II cells also produce surfactant proteins and lipids, which keep the alveoli expanded and function in innate defense of the lung (Evans et al., 1975, Mason, 2006). Epithelial cells that line the respiratory tract initiate pulmonary inflammation in response to pollutants, allergens, or infectious agents (Martin et al., 1997). Bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar type II cells express and secrete proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in response to infection with respiratory viruses including respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A virus, and the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Chan et al., 2005, Yen et al., 2006, Zhang et al., 2001). The role of alveolar type I cells in immune responses to viral infection is largely unknown.",

The two prototype strains of RCoV have different tissue tropisms and disease associations in rats. Sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV) causes disease primarily in the upper respiratory tract, salivary and lacrimal glands, and eyes (Bhatt et al., 1972, Jacoby et al., 1975). SDAV has also been isolated from the lower respiratory tract and can cause mild interstitial pneumonia in young rats (Wojcinski and Percy, 1986). In contrast, Parker's RCoV (RCoV-P) has only been isolated from the respiratory tract and causes fatal pneumonia in suckling rats (Bhatt and Jacoby, 1977, Parker et al., 1970). In adult rats inoculated intranasally with RCoV-P, virus replicates in the upper and lower respiratory tracts. Neutrophils are observed in the nasal cavity, trachea, and alveoli on days 2\u20135, followed by infiltration of mononuclear cells in the lung on day 5 after infection. RCoV-P infection of adult rats causes interstitial pneumonia and focal edema in the alveoli, which resolves by day 8 after infection (Bhatt and Jacoby, 1977). As with RCoV-P, upon intranasal inoculation of adult rats with SDAV, neutrophils are the primary infiltrating cell type in the respiratory epithelium early in infection (Jacoby et al., 1975, Wojcinski and Percy, 1986). RCoV is an important model in which to study the pathogenesis of pulmonary infection caused by a coronavirus in its natural host. Here we examine the role of alveolar type I cells in the innate immune response to rat coronavirus infection.",

To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the in vitro response of rat alveolar epithelial cells to infection with a rat virus. Two strains of RCoV, RCoV-P and SDAV, caused productive infection of alveolar type I cells. Infection of type I cell cultures with these coronaviruses increased expression and secretion of CXC chemokines, CINC-2, CINC-3, and LIX, which are important neutrophil chemoattractants. Secretion of these chemokines was also induced by UV-inactivated viruses, showing that viral replication was not required for the induction of chemokine expression. Dual immunolabeling of viral antigen and CXC chemokines showed that expression of CXC chemokines was primarily from uninfected cells in these cultures. Virus-induced chemokine expression was reduced by IL-1 receptor antagonist, but not soluble TNF receptor, indicating that IL-1 produced by infected cells may induce chemokine expression from the uninfected type I cells. These data suggest that alveolar type I cells can secrete chemokines in response to viral infection, which may lead to infiltration of neutrophils into the lung.",

Brefeldin A inhibits export of secreted proteins from the distal Golgi to the cell surface (Miller et al., 1992).

The IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) binds strongly to the IL-1 type I receptor, thereby preventing signal transduction by IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 (Dinarello, 1996). The TNF soluble receptor protein (TNFsrp) binds to both soluble and membrane-bound forms of TNF-\u03b1, thereby inhibiting their activity (Dinarello, 2005). Treatment of SDAV-inoculated cells with IL-1ra decreased the level of CINC-2, CINC-3, and LIX secretion when it was added to type I cells prior to inoculation and maintained in the medium throughout infection with SDAV (Fig. 7\n). The presence of TNFsrp had no effect on the chemokine secretion during SDAV infection of type I cells. When both IL-1ra and TNFsrp were present during SDAV infection, the levels of CINC-2, CINC-3, and LIX expression were the same as levels from cells that were treated with IL-1ra alone. These data suggest that IL-1 that is secreted from infected alveolar type I cells induces expression of CXC chemokines in uninfected cells in the culture.",

In this study, we evaluated the ability of rat coronaviruses to infect rat alveolar type I cells in vitro. Despite differences in tissue tropism and disease association in vivo, two strains of RCoV were able to infect primary alveolar epithelial cells in vitro. We showed that infection of alveolar type I cells with either RCoV-P or SDAV induced expression of chemokines, CINC-2, CINC-3, LIX, MIP-3\u03b1, and fractalkine at both 6 h and 24 h after inoculation. Our protein array analysis also identified cytokines that are increased in SDAV-infected, but not RCoV-P-infected, alveolar type I cell cultures. This differential cytokine response may play a role in the different pathogenesis of RCoV-P and SDAV infections in vivo. Fractalkine, the sole member of the CX3C chemokine family, is predominately a membrane-bound chemokine and functions in the recruitment and adhesion of cytotoxic lymphocytes to endothelial cell surfaces (Stievano et al., 2004). MIP-3\u03b1, which is chemotactic for dendritic cells, B cells, and memory T cells, is expressed by human bronchial epithelial cells in response to inflammatory mediators IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 (Starner et al., 2003).",

            "text": "Previous studies showed that alveolar type II cells express CXC chemokines both constitutively and in response to treatment with cytokines, LPS, or acid and infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Gonzalez et al., 2005, Jeyaseelan et al., 2005, Mason, 2006, Nishina et al., 2005, Vanderbilt et al., 2003). Our study contributes to the growing body of data that supports a role for alveolar type I cells in chemokine expression (Manzer et al., 2006, Wang et al., 2006). CXC chemokines are important mediators of neutrophil chemotaxis and immunopathology associated with respiratory virus infections (Londhe et al., 2005, Tumpey et al., 2005, Turner, 1990, Yen et al., 2006, Zhang et al., 2001). Therefore, we further quantified the expression of CXC family members CINC-2, CINC-3, and LIX made by rat alveolar type I cells in response to RCoV infection by quantitative RT-PCR and ELISA. Levels of CINC-2, CINC-3, and LIX mRNAs and secreted proteins were increased in RCoV-infected type I cell cultures. CINC-2, CINC-3, and LIX are closely related CXC-ELR+ chemokines that are similar to IL-8/CXCL8 in humans (Shibata et al., 1995, Smith et al., 2002). CINC-2, CINC-3, and LIX specifically bind and signal through CXCR2, a seven transmembrane domain receptor expressed on rat type II alveolar cells, endothelial cells, and neutrophils (Chandrasekar et al., 2003, Dunstan et al., 1996, Shibata et al., 2000, Vanderbilt et al., 2003). Neutrophil chemotaxis and activation are the primary functions of CXCR2 signaling. However, CXCR2 also mediates cellular proliferation and morphogenesis, angiogenesis, and wound healing (Devalaraja et al., 2000). CXC chemokines secreted from infected alveolar epithelial cells could potentially signal through CXCR2 on type II pneumocytes to stimulate type II cell proliferation and trans-differentiation into the type I cell phenotype, resulting in repair of damaged epithelium. Expression of CXCR2 and secretion of CXC chemokines are upregulated in alveolar type II cells by lung injury (Vanderbilt et al., 2003). In addition, CINC-1 signaling through CXCR2 on type II cells promotes alveolar development in newborn rats that are exposed to hyperoxic conditions (Auten et al., 2001). CXC chemokine signaling through CXCR2 on alveolar type II cells and endothelial cells may also promote retraction of these cells, which would promote increased migration of neutrophils and other inflammatory cells into the alveoli (Schraufstatter et al., 2001). Although CINC-2, CINC-3, and LIX signal through the same receptor, they may have some distinct functions during viral infection. For example, although CINC-2 and CINC-3 have similar neutrophil chemotactic activity, CINC-3 induces greater calcium mobilization than CINC-2, resulting in increased neutrophil activation (Shibata et al., 2000). Further studies are needed to elucidate the roles of CINC-2, CINC-3, and LIX in the innate immune response to RCoV infection in vivo.",

            "text": "The production of CXC chemokines by alveolar epithelial cells during viral infection is probably responsible for the recruitment of neutrophils to the infected alveoli, an early event in a variety of respiratory viral infections. Respiratory viruses, including influenza A virus, rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), induce expression of CXC chemokines, which results in an influx of neutrophils into the respiratory tract (Abu-Harb et al., 1999, Tumpey et al., 2005, Turner, 1990, Wang et al., 1998, Zhang et al., 2001, Zhu et al., 1997). Infiltration of neutrophils into lung and other tissues occurs soon after infection with coronaviruses including rat coronaviruses, mouse hepatitis virus strains 1 and JHM, and SARS-CoV, and has been implicated in both immunopathology and virus clearance (Bhatt and Jacoby, 1977, De Albuquerque et al., 2006, Haagmans et al., 2004, Iacono et al., 2006, Tsui et al., 2003, Yen et al., 2006, Zhou et al., 2003). After intranasal inoculation of adult rats with RCoV-P, neutrophils are found in the upper respiratory tract on day 2 and in the lung on day 5, corresponding to the presence of viral antigen and histological lesions (Bhatt and Jacoby, 1977). Neutrophils are also the earliest infiltrating cell type in the respiratory epithelium after intranasal inoculation with SDAV (Jacoby et al., 1975, Wojcinski and Percy, 1986). The role of neutrophils in RCoV clearance and immunopathology is not yet known. Primary cultures of alveolar epithelial cells are an important model in which to study the early events in viral infection that lead to pulmonary inflammation.",

            "text": "Like infection with RCoV-P or SDAV, other UV-inactivated viruses also induce expression of CXC chemokines. UV-inactivated murine coronavirus, MHV-4 variant V5A13.1, induces expression of CXC and CC chemokine genes in primary mouse astrocyte cultures and in the CNS of infected mice during acute and chronic phases of CNS disease (Lane et al., 1998). UV-inactivated RSV or soluble viral glycoproteins (F and G proteins) induce expression of IL-8 in A549 cells (Tirado et al., 2005). Our data show that a component of purified virions that was not destroyed by UV light was responsible for inducing chemokine expression. The viral hemagglutinin esterase glycoprotein (HE) was not required for the induction of CXC chemokines because SDAV virions do not contain HE (Gagneten et al., 1996; Miura and Holmes, unpublished observation). Perhaps interaction of the viral spike glycoprotein with as yet unknown cellular receptor(s) triggers chemokine expression, as SARS-CoV spike protein does in A549 cells (Chang et al., 2004). Alternatively, other viral structural proteins may induce expression of chemokines (Law et al., 2007, Tirado et al., 2005). For several RNA viruses, dsRNA replicative intermediates induce chemokine expression (Hewson et al., 2005, Imaizumi et al., 2004, Londhe et al., 2005). However, this is unlikely to be the case for RCoV because viral replication was not required for chemokine expression.",

In our RCoV-infected type I cell cultures, dual immunolabeling of viral antigen and CXC chemokines demonstrated that the CXC chemokines were expressed principally in cells that did not express viral nucleocapsid protein. This suggests that RCoV infection of alveolar type I cells can indirectly induce expression of chemokines in uninfected cells. Infected cells may release a soluble factor such as IL-1 or TNF-\u03b1, which could stimulate nearby cells to express and secrete CXC chemokines (Manzer et al., 2006, Nishina et al., 2005). To test this hypothesis, we inoculated type I cells with SDAV in the presence of antagonists for the IL-1 and/or TNF receptors, IL-1ra and TNFsrp, respectively. Treatment with IL-1ra, but not TNFsrp, decreased CXC chemokine secretion from SDAV-infected cultures (Fig. 7). Thus, signaling through the IL-1 receptor contributes to the induction of CXC chemokine expression in SDAV-infected type I cell cultures.",

We are studying rat coronaviruses as a model for respiratory coronavirus infection in the natural host of the virus. The study of other rodent viruses in their natural hosts has advanced the understanding of other respiratory viral pathogens, such as Sendai virus and pneumonia virus of mice as models for human parainfluenza and RSV respectively (Faisca and Desmecht, 2007, Rosenberg et al., 2005). Recently the MHV-1 strain of murine coronavirus was shown to induce severe respiratory disease in mice and was proposed as a model for SARS-CoV (De Albuquerque et al., 2006). Primary cultures of rat alveolar epithelial cells will be a valuable model for dissecting the virus-cell interactions and innate immune responses that are important in the critical early steps in pulmonary infection of a virus in its natural host.",

Viral titers were determined by plaque assay on L2P-41.a cells (described below). Purified virus was diluted in DMEM to achieve equivalent doses of RCoV-P and SDAV for inoculation. For experiments with UV-inactivated viruses, the diluted viruses were exposed on ice to UV irradiation in a Stratalinker UV Crosslinker (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) at a cumulative dose of 120  mJ/cm2. Inactivation of virus was demonstrated by plaque assay of the UV-irradiated virus and medium from type I cells 24 h after inoculation with the UV-irradiated virus, as well as by immunofluorescent detection of viral antigens in type I cells 24 h after inoculation with the UV-irradiated virus, using a cross-reactive mAb to the mouse hepatitis virus nucleocapsid protein (described below). These analyses confirmed that the infectivity of the RCoVs was completely eliminated by this UV treatment. UV-irradiated viral inocula were shown to be free of bacterial contamination by inoculation of blood agar and incubation at 37 \u00b0C.",
