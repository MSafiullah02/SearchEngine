We argue that these findings are inconsistent with ''early'' COVID-19. Cases of COVID-19 were identified in Thailand shortly after its first appearance in China 2 ; as of 14 March 2020, there have been 82 confirmed diagnoses of COVID-19 reported in Thailand. All Thai cases are confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in two reference labs, and all patients receive chest CT scans. Thirty-eight of the 82 cases were diagnosed during active screening for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in persons who had been in close contact to patients known to have COVID-19. Most of those screened were asymptomatic or reported only mild symptoms; none showed abnormal findings on chest CT scans. One asymptomatic Thai patient underwent general anesthesia for orthopedic surgery before being diagnosed with COVID-19 in the postoperative period. This case also had normal CT findings at the time of diagnosis.",
