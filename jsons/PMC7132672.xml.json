However, the accompanied Beijing Health Bureau's official document partially assures that a team approach at each hospital be applied to complete the survey as accurately as possible. The removal of a high-ranking official who hid or distorted information during the SARS crisis has created an environment that encourages hospitals to report information accurately. With a pilot study, return questionnaire review, and follow-up investigation, we do not believe that the respondent reporting bias will have a significant impact on the survey results. Second, our study only included secondary and tertiary care hospitals. Primary care hospitals were not included in this study. Although secondary and tertiary care hospitals are the mainstay for Beijing's infectious diseases prevention and control, primary care hospitals roles in prevention and control infectious diseases should not be ignored. However, based on Beijing's SARS control experience, secondary and tertiary care hospitals' emergency response capacity reflects Beijing's emergency response capacity for infectious diseases. Third, only qualitative data were collected for certain questions such as the status of personal protective equipment and specific drugs stockpiles. The answers to these questions are \u201cYes,\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d or \u201cDon't know,\u201d which limited our ability to quantify hospitals personal protective equipment and specific drugs stockpiles preparedness.",
