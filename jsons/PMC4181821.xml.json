According to statistics of South Africa, 10% of the South African population is HIV-positive. This suggests a high percentage of potentially vulnerable individuals9 and highlights the need to determine the association of respiratory viruses like RV with SARI relative to patients with milder illness or without respiratory symptoms.",

We did not follow up on participants over the course of the study to determine whether the RV infection led to a diagnosis of wheezing or asthma or whether any viral nucleic acids detected using RT-PCR may represent the pre-syndromic phase of a viral infection. Also, the case definition for SARI and ILI was restricted to patients with duration of symptoms \u22647 days, so we could have missed some cases that might have more prolonged illness. The collection of different types of samples may potentially affect the sensitivity of RV detection. However, when comparing the detection rate of respiratory viruses in different samples, Blaschke et al.23 have shown that non-invasive methods for collecting respiratory samples can be used to identify respiratory viruses with multiplex PCR testing. Finally, while adjusting for age and HIV status in our analyses on association with disease severity, we were not powered to implement age- and HIV-stratified analysis, hindering the ability to detect differences among different groups.",
