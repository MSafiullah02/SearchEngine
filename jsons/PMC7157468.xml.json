Based on sequence heterogeneity, PED viruses are tentatively categorized as \u201cclassical\u201d and \u201cemerging\u201d strains. The classical strains include PED viruses identified between 1970s to 2010, whereas PED viruses isolated after 2010 are referred to as emerging strains. The emerging strains are further divided into \u201cnon-S INDEL (insertions and deletions)\u201d and \u201cS INDEL\u201d strains on the basis of the spike (S) protein sequences and virulence in piglets. Another proposal classifies PED viruses into up to five genotypes.",

The coding sequence is flanked by untranslated regions (UTRs) at 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends. The N-terminal two-thirds of the genome contain one major open reading frame ORF1a encoding replicase polyprotein pp1a. A -1 frameshift just 5\u2032 to the stop codon of ORF1a gives rise to ORF1b encoding a much longer replicase polyprotein pp1ab. These polyproteins are cleaved into 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps) mostly involved in viral RNA replication. The rest 10-kb genome codes for structural proteins S, M, E, and N, as well as accessory proteins with various functions (Fig. 1\n). TGEV encodes three accessory proteins, whereas PEDV encodes one.",

Virion attachment to a host cell requires the interaction between viral S protein with cellular receptors. Aminopeptidase N (APN) is a major receptor for TGEV. However, whether APN is an essential receptor for PEDV is debatable. PEDV S protein can bind to sialic acid on the cell surface that may mediate virion attachment. After receptor binding, the S protein undergoes proteolytic cleavage that in turn induces membrane fusion and virion entry. Viral RNA with a 5\u2032 cap structure and a 3\u2032 polyadenylated tail serves as an mRNA that is translated by cellular translation machinery to generate viral replicase proteins pp1a and pp1ab. Replication and transcription complexes formed by these proteins produce both genomic and subgenomic progeny RNA species. Structural and accessory proteins are translated from subgenomic RNAs. Nucleocapsids formed by the N protein and progeny viral genomic RNA are enveloped in the endoplasmic reticulum \u2013 Golgi intermediate compartment with the involvement of S, E, and M proteins. The assembled virions are transported to the cell surface and released.",

Live attenuated and inactivated virus vaccines have been developed for both TGEV and PEDV. Since the spike protein is the major immunogen, numerous technologies have been employed to express the spike protein. These include DNA vaccine, vectored vaccine, subunit vaccine, and dendritic cell-based vaccine. Experimental and commercial TGEV and PEDV vaccines are listed in Table 1\n.",

Penetration and uncoating occur after the S protein-mediated fusion of the viral envelope with the plasma membrane. Following disassembly, the viral genome is released into the cytoplasm and immediately translated to yield replicases ppla and pp1ab. These polyproteins are proteolytically cleaved into 16 nsps comprising the replication and transcription complex (RTC) that first engages in the minus-strand RNA synthesis using genomic RNA. Both full- and sub genomic (sg)-length minus strands are produced and used to synthesize full-length genomic RNA and sg mRNAs. Each sg mRNA is translated to yield only the protein encoded by the 5\u2019-most ORF of the sg mRNA. The envelope S, E, and M proteins are inserted in the ER and anchored in the Golgi apparatus. The N protein interacts with newly synthesized genomic RNA to form helical RNP complexes. The progeny virus is assembled by budding of the preformed RNP at the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and then released by the exocytosis-like fusion of smooth-walled, virion-containing vesicles with the plasma membrane.",
