The aim is to describe the genetic diversity and clinical outcomes of FLUV detected at a tertiary university hospital in Barcelona (Spain) during the 2012-2016 seasons. Methods: The detection of FLUV from patients attended at the Emergency Department or admitted to the hospital was performed by either immunofluorescence or PCR-based assays. A specific real-time one-step multiplex RT-PCR was performed for influenza A (FLUAV) subtyping. The complete coding haemagglutinin domain 1 (HA1) and neuraminidase (NA) (2015-2016) protein sequences from a representative sampling were molecular characterised. Results: A total 1774 (66.1%) FLUAV and 910 (33.9%) influenza B (FLUBV) cases were laboratoryconfirmed. The hospitalisation rate was different between seasons, being the highest (81.4%) during the 2014-2015 season. FLUV were genetically close to vaccine strains except to the 2014-2015, in which most characterised A(H3N2) viruses belonged to a genetic group different from the vaccine strain. During the 2015-2016 season, B/Victoria-like viruses were the most predominant, but this component was not included in the trivalent vaccine used. Mutations D222G or D222N in HA1-domain were found in 3 A (H1N1)pdm09 strains from ICU-admitted cases. Three A(H1N1)pdm09 strains carried the NA H275Y (2) and S247N (1) mutations, respectively related to resistance or decreased susceptibility to oseltamivir. Conclusions: The circulation of drifted A(H3N2) strains during the 2014-2015 season was related to the high hospitalisation rate due to the mismatch with the vaccine strains. The predominance of a FLUBV lineage not included in the trivalent influenza vaccine during the 2015-2016 season highlights the need to use a tetravalent influenza vaccine. Virological surveillance of viral variants carrying protein changes that alter tropism and susceptibility to antivirals features should be strengthened in hospital settings.",

Some amino acid substitutions in the HA receptor binding site (RBS) can alter the cellular host tropism, conditioning the species range and tissue tropism, which may be also related to viral virulence [8] . The high mutation rate of the NA protein can also affect the antiviral susceptibility to currently available neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) drugs [9] . In addition, changes in the antigenic features of FLUAV or FLUBV, mainly in HA, explain the occurrence of seasonal influenza epidemics and are the reason for the annual vaccine composition update needed for a more effective prevention of disease and the related complications in high-risk patients [10] . Vaccination is the most effective public health action for preventing influenza. A higher vaccination enhances the achievement of community immunisation [11] . In Catalonia, the influenza vaccination is recommended to individuals over 60 years of age, especially those living in nursing homes, children over 6 months of age and adults with high risk comorbidities for clinical complications due to influenza infection, such as pregnancy or chronic diseases. It is also recommended to healthcare professionals and people working for public services (police, firefighters or teachers). The influenza vaccines available in Catalonia are subunit, adjuvanted and cell-based vaccines. The tetravalent vaccines have only been available since the 2016-2017 season for the vaccination of high-risk patients at hospital settings [12] . The vaccination coverage in our region is variable and goes from 10 to 70% depending on the age group, although the mean coverage is around 35% each season [13] .",

In addition, during the 2015-2016 season, the complete NA coding region was also sequenced for the screening of amino acid substitutions associated with a reduced antiviral susceptibility [9, 16] . HA and NA amplifications were carried out by a one-step RT-PCR assay using the one-step RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with the primers and PCR protocols shown in Supplementary Table 1 . PCR products purification was subsequently performed using Exo-SAP-IT (USB, Affymetrix Inc. Cleveland, Ohio, USA) and sequenced by the ABI Prism Big Dye Terminator cycle sequencing kit v3.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) on the ABI PRISM 3130XL Genetic Analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) with the sequencing primers (Supplementary Table 1 ). Nucleotide sequences were edited and assembled using SeqScape v2.6 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Sequences of the present study were submitted to the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID available at www.platform.gisaid.org).",

Therefore, some differences were found between influenza types (A vs B) or subtypes (H1pdm09 vs H3), or vice versa regarding the age and the clinical outcomes of influenza-confirmed cases, such as hospitalisation, ICU-admission, and mortality rates. In the present study, the population susceptible to FLUAV infection seemed to be older than that susceptible for FLUBV, although FLUAV was predominant in almost all age groups, except to 5-14-year-old group in whom FLUBV prevailed as previously reported by other authors [31, 32] . On the other hand, while no differences were found between A(H1N1) pdm09 and A(H3N2), the distribution of cases by age groups was different. The hospitalisation rate was variable throughout the study reporting differences between seasons, which might be related to the predominant influenza types or subtypes. Overall, FLUAV and A(H3N2) were related to higher hospitalisation rates Table 1 Detection, age (median), age categories/groups, female, hospitalisation, ICU-admission, antiviral treatment and mortality rates (N; %) by influenza types or subtypes and season (% in columns, depending on the influenza type/subtype). than FLUBV and A(H1N1)pdm09, respectively. However, the association of A(H3N2) with a higher hospitalisation and lower ICUadmission rates than A(H1N1)pdm09 might be explained due to the high number of hospitalised cases during the 2014-2015 season when a drifted A(H3N2) virus was circulating [20] . Mortality rate was declining along the study period, not showing differences between FLUV types or subtypes, but highlighting the high mortality rate for A(H1N1)pdm09 during the 2012-2013 season when a low number of FLUAV cases was reported. This decreasing mortality rate over the four seasons could be related to the increase frequency of sampling due to the introduction of PCR-based methods to speed diagnostic and treatment and reducing complications.",

During the last seasons, A(H3N2) viruses acquired a great number of amino acid substitutions, diverging in different genetic clades and subclades as shown in the present study, and continuously changing the potential glycosylation features of HA. In fact, as previously commented, the high activity of A(H3N2) viruses during the 2014-2015 season was related to the circulation of A(H3N2) viruses antigenically different from the vaccine strain used [20] .

On one hand, A(H1N1)pdm09 strains from ICU-admitted cases carrying mutations D222G or D222N in HA1, which are still the unique genetic markers related to disease severity [23] [24] [25] [26] , were detected during the 2012-2013 season but not in later seasons, when a higher A(H1N1)pdm09-related mortality rate was reported. Surely, the prevalence of variants carrying these mutations might be underestimated due to a suboptimal characterisa-tion of severe influenza cases, since the virological surveillance of influenza viruses is overall carried out from samples collected from community-based surveillance networks. On the other hand, the emergence of genetically resistant variants to antiviral drugs is one of the main concerns of influenza surveillance and Public Health worldwide [9, 16] . In the present study, three viruses carrying the mutations H275Y and S247N, associated with resistance or reduced susceptibility to NAIs, were found in respiratory specimens from hospitalised patients under standard oseltamivir treatment during the 2015-2016 season. The fact that immunosuppression status and antiviral treatment administration are considered high-risk factors for the selection and emergence of resistant strains [35] , conditions that are accomplished by many of the patients hospitalised in tertiary centres, highlights the importance to strengthen the virological surveillance of influenza viruses in hospital settings. While surveillance tasks in community-based networks is highly valuable, the information reported in hospital settings, where cases of severe disease or antiviral resistance are attended, should be always considered to monitor circulating viruses, in particular those with novel phenotypic features.",
