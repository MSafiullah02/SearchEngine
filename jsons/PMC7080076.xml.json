Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), oral swabs, anal swabs, and blood samples from patients with severe pneumonia were investigated for pathogen diagnosis at the early stage of the outbreak. Soon, a novel coronavirus was isolated from patients, and the SARS-CoV\u20112, previously named \u201c2019 novel coronavirus\u201d (2019-nCoV), was identified using next-generation sequencing [6].",

Common symptoms at the onset of illness were fever (n=40, 98%), cough (n=31, 76%), and myalgia or fatigue (n=18, 44%); less common symptoms were sputum production (11/39, 28%), headache (3/38, 8%), hemoptysis (2/39, 5%), and diarrhea (1/38, 3%). All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest computed tomography (CT). Complications included ARDS (n=12, 29%), RNAemia (n=6, 15%), acute cardiac injury (n=5, 12%), and secondary infection (n=4, 10%). Among the 41 patients, 13 (32%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and six (15%) died.

Studies have suggested that SARS-CoV-2-infected patients had high levels of interleukin (IL)-1 beta, interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3), IFN inducible protein (IP)-10, and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, which probably led to the activated T\u2011helper\u20111 cell response [9]. Moreover, they found that compared with patients who did not require ICU admission, those requiring ICU admission had higher concentrations of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF), IP-10, MCP\u20111, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1A, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, suggesting that the cytokine storm might affect the disease severity [2]. We noticed that the plasma IL\u20116 level was increased dramatically in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with cardiac injury. Moreover, death was associated with the cardiac damage induced by fulminant myocarditis (FM). Considering that a cytokine storm is also the core pathophysiological mechanism in FM\u2014which is often fatal, especially in patients with severe multiple organ dysfunction\u2014SARS-CoV-2-associated FM should be given more attention.",

The life-support treatments comprised the application of mechanical respirators and circulatory support systems, of which intra-aortic balloon pulsation (IABP) or Impella implantation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) as well as cardiac pacemaker are part of the current therapeutic armamentarium [23].
