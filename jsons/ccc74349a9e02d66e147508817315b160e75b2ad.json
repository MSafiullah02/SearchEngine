            "text": "There is growing interest in technology-enabled contact tracing, the process of identifying potentially infected COVID-19 patients by notifying all recent contacts of an infected person. Governments, technology companies, and research groups alike recognize the potential for smartphones, IoT devices, and wearable technology to automatically track \"close contacts\" and identify prior contacts in the event of an individual's positive test. However, there is currently significant public discussion about the tensions between effective technology-based contact tracing and the privacy of individuals. To inform this discussion, we present the results of a sequence of online surveys focused on contact tracing and privacy, each with 100 participants. Our first surveys were on April 1 and 3, and we report primarily on those first two surveys, though we present initial findings from later survey dates as well. Our results present the diversity of public opinion and can inform the public discussion on whether and how to leverage technology to reduce the spread of COVID-19. We are continuing to conduct longitudinal measurements, and will update this report over time; citations to this version of the report should reference Report Version 1.0, May 8, 2020.",

They indicated concerns about the security and privacy of proximity tracking that may not be consistent with the proximity tracking developers' threat models. We encourage contact tracing and proximity tracking developers to consider how to best communicate the threat model that their protocol defends against to non-technical users, and whether that threat model matches up with what their users actually want and need (Section 6.8).",

We surface these questions further in Section 3.3 and urge other researchers, app developers, technology companies, and governments to consider these issues as they consider developing and deploying automated contact tracing programs.",

            "text": "Why automated contact tracing. Traditionally, contact tracing is done by a team of public health experts and focuses on tracking down those who might have been infected by someone who tested positive for a disease, in combination with widespread testing. There are multiple reasons that a state, region, or other entity might implement or endorse automated contact tracing (likely to augment or complement human-based efforts) though not all experts agree that automated contact tracing is needed or will be effective. For example, as areas move toward stopping \"stay at home\" orders, automated contact tracing might be used to keep the rate of infection low while allowing people to leave the home. Contact tracing technologies might also be used to enforce quarantine for people who have been identified as COVID-19-positive.",

            "text": "Existing automated contact tracing programs as of early May. Some governments have already deployed contact tracing apps or programs, using a variety of devices and data sources [5] . For example, contact tracing apps exist in Bahrain, China, Colombia, the Czech Republic, Ghana, India, Israel, the Republic of North Macedonia, Norway, Singapore, and some US States [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 27, 39, 53] . Some apps are mandatory (e.g., in China), and most are optional (e.g., Singapore) but may struggle with low adoption [32] . Hong Kong deploys electronic wristbands to those infected with COVID-19 in order to ensure they were not leaving their homes [59] . In South Korea, the government sends text messages to everyone in a region with the details of new COVID-19 cases, and there is a central database available with anonymized information; however, some entries in the database have been specific enough to be traced back to a single person, and have started damaging rumors [16, 48] . Taiwan and Israel both use cell tower data: Taiwan uses it for for quarantine geofencing, while Israel uses it for contact tracing (Israel's data comes from a previously secret database used for counterterrorism) [39, 43] . There may also be programs in other regions; this is not meant to be an exhaustive list.",
