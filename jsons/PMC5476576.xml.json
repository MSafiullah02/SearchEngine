The majority of patients with HCV infection fail to clear the virus and develop chronic persistent infections2. Until recently, the standard treatment for HCV infection was a combination of pegylated interferon-\u03b1 (peg-IFN-\u03b1) and ribavirin. Currently, HCV infection is usually treated with various direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) that target different HCV proteins, and a high rate of sustained virological response (SVR) is achieved with these drugs3. Unfortunately, the high cost of DAAs has resulted in limited access in developing countries where the disease burden is relatively high4. DAAs can also lead to the emergence of HCV resistance-associated variants (RAVs). DAA failure usually occurs in less than 5% of treated chronic hepatitis C patients, and RAVs are found in most of these cases5, 6.",

In 2009, it was found that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located near the IFNL3 locus are strongly linked with the response to peg-IFN-\u03b1-based therapy11\u201313. However, the mechanisms by which the SNPs near the IFNL3 locus influenced treatment outcome were unknown until the IFNL4 gene was identified near the IFNL3 locus in 201314. The expression of the IFN-\u03bb4 protein, which is encoded by the IFNL4 gene, is influenced by a germline dinucleotide frameshift variant located in exon 1 of the IFNL4 gene (rs368234815)14. The rs368234815-\u2206G allele generates the full-length IFN-\u03bb4 protein, whereas the rs368234815-TT allele does not generate the IFN-\u03bb4 protein because of a premature stop codon14. A recent study showed that IFNL4-\u0394G/TT is the IFNL gene polymorphism that is primarily responsible for the treatment response to peg-IFN-\u03b1-based therapy15. Chronic hepatitis C patients with the rs368234815-\u2206G allele (\u2206G/TT or \u2206G/\u2206G), which encodes the functional IFN-\u03bb4 protein, respond poorly to peg-IFN-\u03b1-based therapy14, 15.",

As expected, the hepatic levels of ISGs in HCV-infected livers are associated with functional IFN-\u03bb4 expression18, and a functionally impaired variant of IFN-\u03bb4 is associated with weaker induction of ISGs in HCV-infected livers19. These genotype-phenotype correlation studies demonstrate that functional IFN-\u03bb4 protein is the driver of high hepatic ISG expression as well as the cause of poor treatment response. However, there have been no mechanistic studies that could explain why the rs368234815-\u2206G allele encoding the IFN-\u03bb4 protein is associated with a poor response to peg-IFN-\u03b1-based treatment.",

In line with the previous studies7\u201310, we confirmed the induction of IFN-\u03bbs, rather than IFN-\u03b2 (Supplementary Fig. 1). Next, using PHHs from four different donors with IFNL4 \u0394G/\u0394G or TT/\u0394G genotypes, we observed that both poly(I:C) transfection (Fig. 1A) and cell culture-derived HCV (HCVcc) infection (Fig. 1B) induced IFN-\u03bb4 mRNA expression, although the mRNA level of IFN-\u03bb4 was much lower than that of IFN-\u03bb1 (Fig. 1A,B). We also examined time kinetics of IFN-\u03bb4 gene expression after HCVcc infection (Supplementary Fig. 2). We confirmed the expression of IFN-\u03bb4 after HCVcc infection at the protein level in PHHs with IFNL4 \u0394G allele (Fig. 1C,D) whereas PHHs with IFNL4 TT/TT genotype did not produce IFN-\u03bb4 protein after HCVcc infection (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, we detected IFN-\u03bb4 protein in culture supernatant of PHHs with IFNL4 \u0394G/\u0394G genotype after HCVcc infection (Fig. 1E). We reported previously that prolonged stimulation with IFN-\u03bb3 blocks the response to exogenous IFN-\u03b110. To investigate whether the endogenous IFN-\u03bb proteins that are produced in response to HCV infection, including the IFN-\u03bb4 protein, also render cells nonresponsive to exogenous IFN-\u03b1, we infected PHHs with HCVcc and examined the response to exogenous IFN-\u03b1. Both STAT1 phosphorylation (Fig. 1F) and OAS1 upregulation (Fig. 1G) in response to exogenous IFN-\u03b1 were attenuated in HCV-infected PHHs.\n",

Treatment with telaprevir and sofosbuvir reduced the intracellular HCV RNA titre, resulting in greatly attenuated IFN-\u03bb1 and IFN-\u03bb4 gene expression (Fig. 2A). These data indicate that viral replication is critical for the induction of IFN-\u03bb expression in HCV-infected PHHs. Moreover, treatment with telaprevir and sofosbuvir restored IFN-\u03b1 responsiveness, as demonstrated by restored STAT1 phosphorylation (Fig. 2B) and OAS1 upregulation (Fig. 2C). Taken together, these data demonstrate that DAA treatment reduces the expression of IFN-\u03bbs and restores IFN-\u03b1 responsiveness in HCV-infected cells.\n",

We also transfected the cells with IFN-\u03b2- or IFN-\u03bb1-expressing plasmids for comparative purposes. As results, we detected IFN-\u03bb4 protein in cell lysates after transfection with the IFN-\u03bb4-expressing plasmid (Fig. 3A). Moreover, we detected IFN-\u03bb4 protein in culture supernatant by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting (Fig. 3B) although IFN-\u03bb4 protein is known to be poorly secreted when it is expressed in mammalian cells14, 20, 21. Transfection with the IFN-\u03bb4-expressing plasmid induced STAT1 phosphorylation (Fig. 3C) and ISG expression (Fig. 3D) in both Huh-7 cells and in PHHs (Supplementary Fig. 3). Our previous report showed that HCV-infected hepatocytes produce IFN-\u03bbs that increase the protein levels of STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9, and that increased levels of STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9 prolong the upregulation of some ISGs10. Transfection with the IFN-\u03bb4-expressing plasmid also caused sustained upregulation of these ISGs, including Mx1, ISG15, OAS1, OAS2, OAS3, and OASL (Fig. 3E). In fact, the intracellular HCV RNA titre was decreased by transfection with the IFN-\u03bb4-expressing plasmid (Fig. 3F). Furthermore, we used the IFNL4-TT plasmid, which cannot generate IFN-\u03bb4 protein due to a premature stop codon14 and found that it did not cause STAT1 phosphorylation (Fig. 3G) nor did it induce ISG expression (Fig. 3H). STAT1 phosphorylation and induction of ISG expression were also observed by treatment with recombinant IFN-\u03bb4 protein (Supplementary Fig. 4). Silencing IFNLR1 expression (Supplementary Fig. 5A) markedly decreased ISG expression (Supplementary Fig. 5B) and STAT1 phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. 5C) in IFN-\u03bb4 gene-transfected cells and STAT1 phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. 5D) in recombinant IFN-\u03bb4-treated cells, confirming that IFNLR1 is required for the action of IFN-\u03bb4.\n",

However, this unresponsiveness was shown only in response to IFN-\u03b1 treatment, not to IFN-\u03b2 or -\u03bb treatment (Fig. 4A). IFN-\u03bb4-transfected cells were also unresponsive to peg-IFN-\u03b1-2b treatment (Supplementary Fig. 6B). IFN-\u03bb1 pre-treatment also resulted in an attenuated response to exogenous IFN-\u03b1, and the response to IFN-\u03b1 was almost completely blocked by the combination of IFN-\u03bb1 pre-treatment and IFN-\u03bb4 gene transfection (Fig. 4C). This indicates the importance of additional IFN-\u03bb4 protein in IFNL4-\u2206G/TT or IFNL4-\u2206G/\u2206G hosts.

We next performed experiments to confirm the roles of ISG15 and USP18 in IFN-\u03bb4-induced IFN-\u03b1 unresponsiveness. As expected from the previous study10, silencing ISG15 expression decreased the protein level of USP18 in IFN-\u03bb4-transfected cells (Fig. 5C). Silencing the expression of ISG15 or USP18 expression restored STAT1 phosphorylation (Fig. 5D) and ISGs expression (Fig. 5E; Supplementary Fig. 7A) upon exogenous IFN-\u03b1 treatment. However, silencing other ISGs, such as mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) or interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), did not restore exogenous IFN-\u03b1-induced ISG expression (Supplementary Fig. 7B). The response to exogenous IFN-\u03b1 was more strongly restored by silencing USP18 and ISG15 expression at the same time (Fig. 5D,E).

Among the proteins enriched in HCV-infected liver, USP18 has been reported to confer unresponsiveness to IFN-\u03b1 by interacting with IFNAR2 and inhibits downstream signals induced by IFN-\u03b122. In fact, USP18 overexpression decreases the responsiveness to exogenous IFN-\u03b123. Recent reports show that intracellular free ISG15 protein maintains the stability of the USP18 protein in human cells24, 25, although ISG15 has direct antiviral properties against many viruses in mice26. ISG15 deficiency caused increased viral resistance in humans but not mice, since only human ISG15 interacted with USP18 and decreased the response to IFN-\u03b125. More specifically, in human cells, free ISG15 stabilizes the USP18 protein by preventing its ubiquitination, leading to an attenuated response to IFN-\u03b124, 25. Importantly, the ISGylation activity of ISG15 and the deISGylation activity of USP18 do not have any role in this process. It was shown that ISGylation-defective \u0394GG ISG15 also binds to USP18 and prevents its degradation24. Furthermore, previous studies reported that blocking of IFN-\u03b1 signaling by USP18 does not depend on the enzymatic activity of USP1827. The IFN-\u03b1 signal-blocking activity of USP18 is mediated by the binding of USP18 to the intracellular domain of IFNAR2, which prevents the binding of JAK1 to IFNAR227.",

However, our current study showed the expression of IFN-\u03bb4 after HCV infection for the first time. In addition, we observed IFN-\u03b1 unresponsiveness in a more natural system for HCV infection. We infected PHHs with HCVcc and observed IFN-\u03b1 unresponsiveness which was caused by endogenously produced IFNs, including IFN-\u03bb4. Moreover, we identified ISG15 as a critical regulator for increased USP18 protein levels in IFN-\u03bb4-expressing or -treated cells and demonstrated for the first time that DAAs can restore IFN-\u03b1 responsiveness by decreasing the production of endogenous IFN-\u03bbs, including IFN-\u03bb4, in HCV-infected cells.",
