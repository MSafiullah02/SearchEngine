Of interest, the overall number of hospitalizations has continued to decrease in the last 20 years, given the improvement in diagnosis and treatment. Marx et al. [10] from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) studied the overall burden of croup and showed that the mean annual number of croup hospitalizations is about 41,000 (range, 27,000\u201362,000/year) in the U.S. Ninety-one percent of hospitalizations occur among children <5 years of age. The authors also reported that minor peaks in croup hospitalizations occurred each year in February, and major peaks occurred in October of odd-numbered years, which coincides with peak parainfluenza type 1 activity.",

Both bacteria and viruses may be responsible for infections with collateral components, such as laryngotracheobronchitis, and the more general laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis. In 1958, the first evidence for association between croup and two newly isolated myxoviruses, parainfluenza virus types 1 and 2, resulted in separation of two categories of cases\u2014mild, requiring only outpatient follow up, and severe, requiring hospitalization [12]. Parainfluenza is a RNA paramyxovirus that actively replicates in respiratory epithelial cells and is comprised of four major serotypes. Parainfluenza type 3, more commonly associated with bronchiolitis or bronchopneumonia, can also produce severe croup in an endemic pattern, while type 4 is rarely seen. Parainfluenza 1 and 2, account for >65 % of all causes of croup. A large series studied 6165 instances of lower respiratory tract infections (LRIs) wherein approximately 75 % of all isolates were identified as parainfluenza viruses. Of these, parainfluenza type 1 accounted for about 60 %. Conversely, the propensity of the various organisms to produce symptoms of croup reached 60 % for both parainfluenza 1 and 2. For parainfluenza type 3, the number dropped to about 30 %, whereas all the other microorganisms accounted for about 5\u201315 %. Thus, parainfluenza viruses were the most common cause for all age groups; whereas respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) caused croup in infants and the influenza viruses and M. pneumoniae were significant causes of croup only in children older than 5 years of age. Summertime croup may be due to enteroviruses, adenovirus, or parainfluenza type 3.",

Prematurity is associated with an increased risk for mortality, with factors such as a decrease in gestational age, increased perinatal oxygen requirements and discharge within 3 months of the RSV season increasing the likelihood for hospitalization [14]. Among the rare viral causes, measles, by virtue of immunosuppression, leads to a bacterial superinfection that results in a condition termed measles-associated bacterial tracheitis (MABT), which carries an increased risk for need of artificial airway and intensive care admission [15].",

Later, cool mist was observed to have the same degree of therapeutic benefit as warm mist, and this avoids the risk of burns. There are at least three postulated mechanisms, which include (i) a soothing effect on inflamed mucosa, (ii) reduced viscosity of tracheal secretions and (iii) activation of laryngeal mechanoreceptors leading to reduction of turbulence [23]. However, humidity may also trigger bronchospasm, thus the duration of therapy should be carefully monitored. Recent studies have, however, shown that the benefits offered by mist treatment may be overemphasized. Three separate studies, that did not include untreated controls, determined that the efficacy of aerosolized mist may not be proportional to the degree of mist saturation, for e.g. the effects of humidity at three different levels (100 %, 40 % and 33 %) remained the same [46]. In yet another study, the effect of nebulized saline was identical to mist. Lastly, a recent Cochrane review of data concluded that the benefit of mist therapy remains unproven [47].\n",

Early studies showed immediate clinical benefit with use of 2.25 % racemic epinephrine, and the more recent studies demonstrated the same amount of benefit for L-epinephrine at a ratio of 1:1000 used with 5 mL saline [53]. Initial studies represented a major paradigm shift in management of children with severe croup, obviating the need for endotracheal intubation or tracheostomy [54]. The therapeutic effects of epinephrine are mediated via \u03b1-adrenergic receptors that results in constriction of capillary arterioles and reduced inflammation. Unfortunately, although the effects are almost immediate, they only last approximately 2 h, and hence the child should be watched for a reasonable period of time prior to discharge. This therapy may be suitable even in the outpatient setting if the observation period is adequate, although lack of improvement at about an hour following treatment may convert an outpatient encounter to hospitalization [55]. When conditions such as tetralogy of Fallot, tachycardia or ventricular outlet obstruction co-exist, epinephrine should be used cautiously [23]. With the peak effect occurring between 30 and 60 min, the child should be carefully monitored for the rebound effect\u2014which usually occurs 3 h after treatment. The recommended dose is thus 2.25 % (0.25 mL in 3.75 mL of saline) for children <6 months of age and 0.5 mL for infants and children >6 months. Substituting isotonic with hypertonic saline (3 %) may enhance the effect by absorbing water from the submucosa.\n",

As an appreciable number of children with severe croup progress to respiratory failure needing an artificial airway, using heliox can reduce the work of breathing by easing the delivery of oxygen to the lower airway past the site of obstruction.

In the past, inappropriately prescribed antibiotics have been reported to cause superinfections, prolongation of hospital stay as well as general increase in costs [29]. However, when the diagnosis of bacterial tracheitis is strongly suspected, the management changes wherein culture-directed antibiotic therapy is the gold standard of treatment. Empiric therapy with coverage that includes S. aureus, S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae is indicated. In an era when both hospital-acquired and community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) are prevalent, the combination of vancomycin and a third generation cephalosporin (such as cefotaxime or ceftriaxone) is a reasonable choice until identification and susceptibility of the causative organism is established. In an intubated patient, tracheal aspirates should be obtained. A very useful adjunct to anti-microbial therapy is the use of frequent pulmonary toilet and debridement of tracheal pseudomembranes under bronchoscopic guidance [59]. In the presence of other co-morbidities such as immunosuppression, mortality increases. Reported complications of bacterial tracheitis include pneumomediastinum, sepsis and multi-organ failure, bronchospasm and impaired gas-exchange due to the burden of pseudomembranes with toxic shock syndrome [60].
