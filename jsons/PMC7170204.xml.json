The ferret is most closely related to, and may be a descendent of, the European polecat, M. putorius, or the Steppe polecat, M. eversmanni. It should not be confused with the North American black-footed ferret, M. nigripes. The name Mustela putorius furo was derived from the Latin words putor and furonem, meaning \u201cstinky thief,\u201d and accurately describes its mischievous behavior and musky odor.",

They are very lively and active creatures, playing hard about 25% of the day and utilizing the remaining 75% for sleep. Ferrets are very curious and often investigate the smallest of spaces with ease, given their tubular-shaped, flexible bodies. They may be vocal at times, eliciting a chirp with excitement during play, a hiss of warning when threatened, or a scream when a painful stimulus is experienced. Ferrets normally carry themselves as they walk with their torso elevated off of the ground in a slightly hunched posture. This posture is exaggerated during play, when they distinctly arch their backs, bringing their front and rear feet closer together, and move around with a characteristic bounce.",

Also quite common are the albino; the black-eyed white, with a white coat and dark irises; and the cinnamon, with beige guard hair, no mask, and a cream-colored undercoat. Silver ferrets, when young, have dark gray guard hairs, an indistinct mask, and some white present on the ventrum. As they age, the coat progressively turns to a black-eyed white variation. Varieties that have white paws are considered \u201cmitts,\u201d and those with white heads and bibs are called \u201cpandas.\u201d It has been reported that breeding silver mitts together or with black-eyed whites can produce offspring with congenital abnormalities.1 A healthy ferret coat is shed twice a year, resulting in a long, thick winter coat and a shorter summer coat.",

The anal glands are usually removed at an early age in the United States at the breeding facility. Ferrets are unable to sweat because of a lack of sweat glands in the skin.3, 4 Overheated ferrets often flatten their bodies on a cool surface to dissipate body heat. Despite their musky odor, ferrets should be bathed no more than once or twice a month; otherwise, excessive drying of the skin and subsequent pruritus could result.",

Ferrets that are prone to develop gastric hairballs can be given 1 to 2 ml of a cat laxatone 2 to 3 times a week as a prophylaxis. Water should always be made readily available. This can be accomplished via a heavy bowl or a sipper bottle. Fasting of ferrets for procedures requiring sedation or blood tests may be accomplished by withholding food for 4 to 6 hours.

These early visits to the veterinary clinic are great opportunities for veterinarians to educate owners about proper diet and husbandry.

The routine exam also creates opportunities for grooming (e.g., nail trimming) and identification and scheduling of necessary dental care.

A recommended schedule for administration of the CDV vaccine is when the ferret is 6 to 8 weeks, 10 to 12 weeks, and 14 to 16 weeks of age; the rabies vaccine should be administered at the time of the last distemper vaccination. Thereafter, annual booster vaccines for CDV and rabies are recommended. The vaccines can be administered subcutaneously in the interscapular region of the body.

However, due to the occurrence of adverse reactions, recommendations for vaccination must be made on an individual basis with the animal's age, immune status, and current health status in mind. Ferrets that have exhibited previous vaccine reactions should either receive no further CDV vaccine or receive a dose of diphenhydramine 15 minutes before vaccination, although there have been variable results with the latter option. An effective alternative CDV vaccine, which has not yet been found to elicit anaphylactic reactions, is Galaxy-D (Schering-Plough Animal Health Co., Omaha, NE), a modified-live primate cell culture CDV vaccine.7 Duration of immunity induced by this vaccine in the ferret remains unknown, and use of Galaxy-D is extra-label in the ferret, requiring informed owner consent.",

The purpose of the quarantine period is to identify and prevent transmission of infectious disease potentially carried by the new ferret. The duration of this period allows for the development of any clinical signs in a seemingly healthy ferret following entrance into the new household. Quarantine requires complete isolation of the ferret and its food, water, and cage supplies from other animals in the household for a period of at least 30 days. Proper hygiene such as hand washing, disinfection, and sanitation should be practiced during this period to avoid the transmission of any infectious organisms. The ferret also should receive physical and fecal examinations initially and vaccinations during quarantine. Should the new ferret exhibit any signs of sneezing, coughing, nasal or ocular discharge, fever, skin infection, diarrhea, or general unthriftiness, it should be brought to a veterinarian knowledgeable in ferret medicine immediately for a diagnostic work-up. In practice, these ferrets or any ferrets without a vaccination or medical history should be kept in strict isolation, as they can carry and transmit disease, such as canine distemper, to small animal patients. Precautions also should be made to prevent the transmission of any zoonotic disease from the ill ferret to the caretaker.",

Sterilization is the complete removal of all living microorganisms from an object, an important application for instruments used for surgery or open wounds where there is a risk of infection. Techniques and agents should be chosen based on the nature and composition of the surface to be disinfected, the level of contamination and the degree of microbial killing desired, and the efficacy and safety of the disinfectant.13 Sterilization should be performed on all surgical instruments through physical (moist or dry heat) or chemical (glutaraldehyde, ethylene oxide, 58% hydrogen peroxide) means. When using a disinfectant, veterinarians should always follow the manufacturer's recommendations on preparation and use to ensure efficacy and safety. Physical cleaning of any objects intended for disinfection improves the action of the disinfectant, as the killing power of disinfectants is significantly affected by the presence of organic matter. Antiseptics should be chosen based on their spectrum of action, residual effects, and tissue safety. Refer to Table 13-1\nfor information on commonly used antiseptics and disinfectants.",

This can be seen as two blue dots that are located on the ventral aspect of the right pinna. The nose should be examined for discharge, and the owner questioned about the ferret sneezing. Scruffing the ferret to elicit the characteristic yawn aids in oral examination. The mucous membranes should be pink and moist with a capillary refill time less than 2 seconds, indicating adequate hydration. It is important to examine the tongue and palate for evidence of ulcers or structural defects. Identification of the existence of any dental disease is important to the overall health of the ferret, with initiation of appropriate therapy and prophylaxis. Examination of the teeth may reveal broken canines.

There is little information available on blood coagulation parameters in ferrets, although the prothrombin time has been reported to be 14.4 to 16.5 seconds.18 As with other animals, there is an age-related decrease in the enzyme alkaline phosphatase due to a reduction in the bone isozyme when rapid growth has ceased.18 Differential diagnoses for ferret patients that present with elevated liver enzymes include liver disease, exposure to ingested or environmental toxins, and Aleutian disease.19 Creatinine is normally cleared from the blood much faster in ferrets than other mammalian species; thus, any elevation in creatinine is significant and should be pursued further.20\nBOX 13-3Hematologic Values for the Ferret**Combined values for adult female ferrets and for adult intact and castrated males from Fox JG: Normal clinical and biologic parameters.

Care should be taken to prevent iatrogenic perforation of the urethra when passing the catheter through this turn at the ischial arch. With the ferret placed in dorsal recumbency, the penis is extracted from the prepuce, initiating the catheterization process. Magnification may be necessary to visualize the urethral opening on the ventral aspect of the penis. A needle with the bevel filed off can be inserted into the opening to flush and distend the urethra with saline to facilitate the introduction of the catheter into the urethra. A water-soluble lubricant also makes passage of the catheter easier. A 20- to 22-gauge, 8-inch jugular catheter, a 3.5-Fr red rubber tube, or a 3.0-Fr Slippery Sam Tomcat urethral catheter (Cook Veterinary Products, Eight Mile Plains, Queensland, Australia) may be used.21 The latter option is preferred based on the size and rigidity of the catheter.

Fecal exams for parasite identification may be performed at the time of the annual exam using a direct smear and a fecal flotation technique with sodium nitrate or a sugar solution. Further discussion of internal parasitism can be found in the section on infectious diseases.

Metronidazole is best compounded to a 50-mg/ml meat-flavored suspension because of the drug's naturally bitter taste. During the initial stages of treatment, supportive care should not be overlooked. Fluids for the dehydrated patient and a highly palatable, easily digested diet such as Hill's Prescription Diet Canine/Feline a/d or Glucerna should be administered until the ferret regains its appetite.

Desulfovibrio sp., an intracellular Campylobacter-like organism, is the causative agent of ferret PBD and infects the ileum, the colon, or both.28, 29, 30, 31, 32\nDesulfovibrio sp. is closely related to, or is the same organism as, Lawsonia intracellularis, the etiologic agent of swine proliferative enteropathy.32 Acute signs of this disease include colitis, diarrhea with flecks of blood, anorexia, and weight loss. Chronically affected ferrets may exhibit chronic diarrhea, tenesmus, and rectal prolapse. Neurologic signs, such as head tilt, ataxia, or tremors, may even be present in some cases.31, 33 On examination of a ferret with PBD, palpation of the abdomen may reveal a segmentally thickened colon and enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes. Other causes of GI disease should be ruled out; however, a presumptive diagnosis may be made based on history, clinical signs, and physical exam. PBD can be confirmed by histopathologic tests of tissue biopsies obtained from intestines or colon. The organism is identified using the Warthin-Starry stain and appears as comma-shaped organisms located in the apical regions of intestinal epithelial cells.28 The preferred treatment is chloramphenicol, orally, subcutaneously, or intramuscularly at 50 mg/kg every 12 hours for 2 to 3 weeks.29, 31, 33 If present, a rectal prolapse typically resolves with the antibiotic treatment, rarely requiring the application of a purse-string suture. When treated early in the disease process, most ferrets respond well; however, there are ferrets that do not survive despite implementation of the recommended treatment and supportive care.",

Harsh lung sounds, wheezes, or crackles may be heard on auscultation. A CBC often reveals a leukocytosis characterized by a neutrophilia with a left shift. An interstitial or alveolar pattern may be evident on radiographs. When aspiration pneumonia is present, the dependent lung lobes show evidence of change on radiographs, whereas primary airway disease produces a bronchial pattern. The most helpful diagnostic approach is a cytologic examination and culture of material obtained through a tracheal or lung wash. Cytologic examination typically reveals a septic inflammatory process characterized by degenerative neutrophils. The culture and sensitivity are important to ensure appropriate antibiotic selection. Until the clinician receives these results, initiation of a broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment regimen is warranted. Supportive care, including fluid therapy and nutritional support, is important in promoting the recovery of ferrets diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia.",

If catheterization is still not possible, a temporary tube cystotomy may be necessary.21 Once the patient has been stabilized, a cystotomy can be performed for stone retrieval, either directly from the bladder or by anterograde flushing of the urethra to dislodge the calculi. Stones should then be submitted for analysis to determine the proper course of treatment and prevent further stone formation. Should removal of the stone be unsuccessful, a perineal urethrostomy is indicated.21 This procedure should be performed caudal to the base of the os penis in males. A perineal urethrostomy is indicated only in the treatment of urethral obstruction caused by urolithiasis, as it will be unsuccessful in cases of prostatic disease.

There is no sex predilection; males and females are equally affected. It is commonly diagnosed as adenoma, adrenocarcinoma, or adrenal hyperplasia.33, 49, 50 Adrenal gland disease in ferrets differs from that of dogs in that the disease is characterized by the hypersecretion of sex steroids rather than cortisol. In ferrets, one or more sex steroids such as androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA), estradiol, or 17-a-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) will be elevated, whereas cortisol levels are usually within a normal range.33, 50, 51 The early age at which ferrets are spayed and neutered in the United States has been associated with development of the disease later in life.33, 50, 51, 52, 53 It has been proposed that at the early time of spaying and neutering, there are undifferentiated gonadal cells associated with the adrenal gland. The removal of the testicles or ovary and uterus allow for the chronic, unregulated stimulation of these remaining gonadal cells within the adrenal cortex by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), resulting in ferret adrenal gland disease.",

Quite often in early stages, it may begin as a seasonal alopecia that eventually does not grow back after 2 to 3 seasonal cycles. Pruritis may be evidenced by the presence of erythema or papules in the dorsal neck or interscapular area. Muscle atrophy is another characteristic sign of this disease. The elevated sex hormone levels also stimulate sexual behavior in males and produce a mild to significant vulvar enlargement in females, mimicking natural estrus. A mucopurulent discharge may be associated with the vulvar enlargement, and some female patients will develop a secondary vaginitis. Ferrets that are chronically affected can present with life-threatening, secondary disease, such as bone marrow toxicity in females (and males) (further described in Hyperestrogenism) and urinary obstruction in males due to prostatomegaly. The secondary prostatic disease may be cystic or hyperplastic, but it is hormone responsive and will typically resolve with treatment of the adrenal gland disease.50, 54 Palpation of enlarged adrenal glands is not always successful because of the abundance of fat that usually surrounds the glands in the retroperitoneal space. The left adrenal gland is palpated more often than the right and can be located craniomedial to the left kidney, whereas the right adrenal gland lies more on the midline and under the caudal extent of the liver.",

As the disease progresses and hypoglycemia worsens, more significant clinical signs develop, such as hypothermia, ptyalism, mental dullness, tremors, acute collapse, or a classic glassy-eyed appearance. Because ptyalism is associated with nausea, other diseases such as gastric ulcers or foreign body should be ruled out. Ferrets severely affected by low blood glucose may even have seizures or be comatose.

A human glucometer developed for diabetic patients facilitates measurement of blood glucose in practice, although these devices have not been validated for the ferret. Increased insulin levels and insulin : glucose ratio are also supportive of a diagnosis of insulinoma, but it is possible that ferrets with this disease may have normal insulin levels.50, 62, 64 Additional parameters on a serum biochemical assay are typically within normal limits, with the exception of an elevated ALT.

            "text": "Treatment of insulinoma may be accomplished medically or surgically. Medical treatment involves dietary management and the administration of prednisone, diazoxide, or octreotide, alone or in combination.62 Prednisone acts by blocking peripheral uptake of glucose by cells and increasing hepatic gluconeogenesis. Initially it can be dosed at 0.25 mg/kg orally every 12 hours, but it can be increased up to 2 mg/kg every 12 hours as needed to control hypoglycemia. Prednisone has the unfortunate characteristic of a bitter taste, and ferrets tend to object to its administration. To improve palatability and acceptance, preparations containing alcohol should be avoided. Pediatric formulations of prednisone and prednisolone are available: the formulations Orapred (Lyne Laboratories, Inc., Brockton, MA) and Pediapred (Medeva Pharmaceuticals, Rochester, NY) work quite well. Smaller doses of prednisone can be used when diazoxide, a benzothiadiazine derivative, is added to the treatment plan. Diazoxide functions to antagonize the effects of insulin. It too has a broad dose range, which can be started at 10 mg/kg orally and divided twice a day, and increased to 60 mg/kg divided twice daily as needed.30 Disadvantages associated with diazoxide include expense and gastrointestinal complications (e.g., vomiting and anorexia).50 A 50-mg/ml suspension of diazoxide is available (Proglycem; Baker Norton Pharmaceuticals, Miami, FL), as well as 100-mg pills (Proglycem; Schering Canada, Inc., Pointe-Claire, Quebec, Canada), which can be compounded to a suspension at a lesser expense to the owner. The use of prednisone and diazoxide in combination should improve the blood glucose levels of the ferret in 24 to 48 hours. As neither drug slows or stops tumor growth, the dosages will need to be increased periodically as the disease progresses. Octreotide is a somatostatin analog that inhibits insulin secretion by the pancreatic tumor.62 Because Octreotide requires subcutaneous injection every 12 hours; it is rarely used to treat ferrets diagnosed with insulinoma. Dietary management involves the feeding of meals high in protein and fat, 3 to 4 times a day. Simple sugars should not be offered. The blood glucose is measured daily until clinical signs are eliminated and weekly until the fasting blood glucose is within the normal range; drug dosages should be adjusted as needed. Thereafter, the affected ferret's blood glucose level should be rechecked every 3 months to ensure successful treatment.",

Complications such as pancreatitis or iatrogenic diabetes are rare with surgical intervention.61, 62 It is important to note, that although the disease-free interval is increased with surgical therapy, recurrence is typically seen 7 to 10 months after surgery.61, 62, 63 Medical therapy is usually chosen upon recurrence of the disease.

Fine needle aspiration and biopsy are quite useful for the definitive diagnosis of lymphoma. A fine needle aspirate should be performed on any masses or pleural effusion. The thoracic aspirate of pleural effusion allows for the differentiation between lymphoma, cardiac disease, pyothorax, or chylothorax. A bone marrow aspirate should be performed on any ferrets with evidence of leukemia, anemia, or atypical lymphocytes on the CBC. A peripheral lymph node biopsy or nodectomy with subsequent histopathologic evaluation of the tissue sample, particularly of the popliteal lymph node, is ideal for confirming a diagnosis of lymphoma in the ferret.47 This can be beneficial in determining the diagnosis even if performed on a lymph node of normal size. Histopathologic examination of an enlarged peripheral lymph node may reveal lymphoid hyperplasia, which is often caused by viral infection or chronic antigenic stimulation. Histopathologic classification of ferret lymphoma cases are high grade, diffuse, small noncleaved, or immunoblastic in young.44 Older ferret lymphoma cases have been classified as mixed cell immunoblastic (most commonly) or mature lymphocytic.",

Additionally, those that have been previously treated with corticosteroids have a poor response to chemotherapy. The prognosis for ferrets with no overt clinical signs, but which were diagnosed based on chronic lymphocytosis and a positive lymph node biopsy, is variable.47 Older ferrets probably respond better because the neoplasia has a slower growth rate. Treatment should never be considered curative for a ferret patient diagnosed with lymphoma. Remission can be achieved with marked improvement or return to a clinically normal state.47 Remission may be defined as resolution of organomegaly and a normal CBC.

Before the initiation of chemotherapy a full patient evaluation should be made, consisting of a CBC, serum biochemistry panel, radiographs, and bone marrow aspirate. This allows for the complete assessment of the patient for risks associated with, and prognosis for, response to therapy. Patients with greater than 50% of the bone marrow composed of malignant cells are at a high risk for fatal complications from chemotherapy.47 The client should be educated on the need for complete compliance, good nutritional support, and close monitoring of the patient. Side effects are dependent on the drugs that are used, but they are the same as those described in other species. Lethargy, posterior paresis, anorexia, vomiting, mild hair loss, dyspnea, and collapse are the most common side effects seen in ferrets. They may occur as soon as 1 to 2 days posttreatment or as late as 2 weeks posttreatment.47 Veterinarians should always follow standard safety protocols when using antineoplastic drugs. Intravenous drug administration should be performed under anesthesia, using an indwelling catheter. To ensure patency, the catheter should always be flushed before drug administration, and extravasation should be managed according to procedures appropriate for the drug. With doxorubicin, the catheter should not be flushed with heparinized saline, as the heparin will cause the doxorubicin to precipitate out. The CBC should be evaluated no more than 24 hours before each treatment. Should the total white blood cell count drop below 1500/mm,3 the PCV below 30%, or the patient become debilitated, treatment should be discontinued or postponed until the physiologic parameters return to normal.47 The CBC should be rechecked 1 to 2 times a week until it has returned to normal limits. Additionally, nutritional support during chemotherapy is very important. The administration of Nutri-Cal, meat baby food, or Hill's Prescription Diet Canine/Feline a/d may be used as a nutritional supplement.",

Renal cysts may cause a problem when a significant amount of the normal renal architecture is disrupted by the size of the cyst. When polycystic disease is identified, a CBC, serum biochemistry panel, and urinalysis should be performed to determine the effects of the cysts. Just as in the dog and the cat, the urea nitrogen and creatinine are used to evaluate renal function. Creatinine, however, declines very quickly in the blood of ferrets; therefore, any elevation should be considered significant. Ultrasonography can be used to evaluate renal architecture, and intravenous pyelography can be used to evaluate renal function. There is no treatment available for bilateral renal cystic disease. If one kidney is compromised by the presence of renal cysts, a unilateral nephrectomy can be performed if the opposite kidney has adequate function.

On abdominal palpation, intestinal loops may feel thickened and mesenteric lymph nodes enlarged. A CBC will often reveal eosinophilia. Diagnosis is confirmed with gastric or intestinal biopsy and histopathologic examination. Other GI pathogens should be investigated, including internal parasites or Helicobacter spp., which may contribute to the development of the disease. Treatment in ferrets is similar to that used in dogs, cats, and humans with eosinophilic gastroenteritis and is focused on reducing the inflammatory process.

Additional diagnostic tests to consider include radiographs, serum biochemistry panel (or at least a glucose level check), and urinalysis to rule out other disease processes, such as insulinoma or cardiac disease.

            "text": "A diagnosis of heart disease is made based upon history and clinical signs, physical exam findings, radiographic evidence, electrocardiography (ECG), and echocardiography. Radiographically a globoid heart is commonly present and may be accompanied by pleural effusion, pulmonary venous congestion, or a diffuse interstitial pattern. Additional findings may include hepatomegaly, splenomegaly and ascites. An ECG is helpful in the identification of arrhythmias and conduction disturbances. Ideally the ECG should be performed without the aid of anesthesia. The ECG can be accomplished more efficiently by removing the metal teeth of the clasps, to which ferrets actively object, and utilizing techniques of distraction such as a Nutri-Cal treat. Ferret ECGs on lead II have small P waves that are similar to cats and large R waves similar to dogs.25 Additionally, the normal ferret ECG will contain short QT intervals and elevated ST segments. Abnormal findings may include, but are not limited to, sinus tachycardia, atrial or ventricular premature complexes, sinus bradycardia, tall and wide QRS complexes, and depression of the ST segment.25, 66 The presence of a second- or third-degree atrioventricular block is indicative of significant heart disease. Echocardiography, also best performed without sedation, is useful in the assessment of chamber size, shape, function, pleural and pericardial effusion, and cardiac or mediastinal masses. Color flow Doppler imaging allows for evaluation of valvular insufficiency by providing information on the direction of blood flow and the presence of turbulance.25 Additional tests, such as a CBC and serum biochemistry panel, can provide information of concurrent disease. Microfilarial testing and heartworm antigen testing can be used to diagnose heartworm disease. Thoracocentesis not only has diagnostic value but may also offer temporary respiratory relief to ferrets with pleural effusion.",

Gross pathology reveals dilation of both atria and ventricles, and histopathology reveals multifocal myocardial degeneration, necrosis, and fibrosis. Treatment should be aimed at altering the heart rate, preload, afterload, and contractility. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is also diagnosed in ferrets. Ferrets with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy will have a thickened interventricular septum and a thickened left ventricular wall.25 Histopathologically, these ferrets have fibrous connective tissue throughout the myocardium. The main objective of medical treatment is to improve diastolic function. The diagnosis of valvular disease in middle-aged ferrets is increasing.25 In this disease process, valves become thickened and atria become dilated secondary to the developing valvular insufficiency. Myxomatous degeneration is a common histopathologic finding in valvular disease.25 Another type of cardiac disease in ferrets is myocardititis, which is caused by toxoplasma-like organisms, ADV, sepsis, and heartworm disease.25 There have been no reports of congenital cardiac disease or primary cardiac neoplasia in the ferret.",

            "text": "Treatment depends on the type of heart disease present and is based on treatment strategies in the dog and cat. Furosemide can be used safely in ferrets to alleviate fluid retention due to cardiac failure. The recommended dosage for furosemide is 2.5 to 4 mg/kg every 8 to 12 hours.66 Digoxin, a positive inotrope, is integral to the treatment of dilated cardiomyopathy. The recommended initial dosage is 0.01 mg/kg orally every 24 hours and it should be increased to every 12 hours or decreased to once every other day, depending on the case. Just as in dogs and cats, serum digoxin levels should be checked 8 hours posttreatment to ensure that therapeutic levels are reached (0.8-2.0 ng/ml).25 The dosage is based on an estimated 75% lean body weight.30 Ferrets should be monitored for side effects that may be associated with digoxin therapy, such as cardiac arrhythmias, inappetence, vomiting, and diarrhea. Digoxin should not be used in ferrets that are azotemic or hypokalemic or have frequent ventricular arrhythmias. Nitroglycerin 2% ointment is also beneficial as a venodilator in the treatment of dilated cardiomyopathy. It can be applied to a shaved area of the skin on the inner thigh or pinna, 1/8 inch in size, every 12 to 24 hours.25, 30 ACE-inhibitors are used to reduce arteriolar and venous tone, to increase cardiac output, and decrease edema; however, ferrets are sensitive to their hypotensive effects and thus require close monitoring. After an initial low dose, the amount can be increased if there is no ill response (e.g., inappetence, lethargy). The recommended dosage for enalapril is 0.25 0.5 mg/kg orally every 24 to 48 hours.30 Beta-adrenergic blockers and calcium channel blockers may be used for the treatment of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Their usage results in a decreased heart rate and increased diastolic filling. The recommended dose for atenolol is 6.25 mg orally every 24 hours, and propranolol is 0.2 to 1 mg/kg orally every 8 to 12 hours.25, 30 Diltiazem, a calcium channel blocker, is administered at a dose of 3.75 to 7.5 mg orally every 12 hours.25 Side effects of diltiazem include arrhythmia, lethargy, and inappetence. Supportive care for the cardiac patient includes oxygen supplementation for dyspnea, restricted activity, and a low salt diet. The prognosis for ferrets with cardiac disease is guarded to poor, even with intensive medical treatment.",

Cryptosporidium parvum is also a zoonotic concern, particularly for the immunocompromised pet owner, given its tendency to infect a variety of species. Ferrets are susceptible to several bacterial diseases (e.g., salmonellosis, listeriosis, tuberculosis, leptospirosis, campylobacteriosis), which may have zoonotic potential as well.69 When treating an ill ferret, proper hygiene and disinfection should be a routine practice in the veterinary clinic so as to prevent disease transmission among animals and caretakers.
