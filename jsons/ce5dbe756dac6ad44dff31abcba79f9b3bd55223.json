It is unlikely to be the last and it is crucial that real lessons are learned from the experience. Asia is considered a hot spot for the emergence of new pathogens including past influenza pandemics. On this occasion while preparing for an avian, highly virulent influenza virus (H5N1 like) originating in Asia in fact the pandemic originated from swine, and was less virulent. This discrepancy between what was planned for and what emerged created its own challenges. The H1N1 pandemic has tested national health-care infrastructures and exposed shortcomings in our preparedness as a region. Key health challenges include communication throughout the region, surge capacity, access to reliable information and access to quality care, healthcare worker skills, quality, density and distribution, access to essential medicines and lack of organizational infrastructure for emergency response. Despite years of preparation the public health and clinical research community were not ready to respond and opportunities for an immediate research response were missed. Despite warm words and pledges efforts to engage the international community to ensure equitable sharing of limited resources such as antivirals and vaccines fell short and stockpiles in the main remained in the rich world. This manuscript with authors from across the region describes some of the major challenges faced by Asia in response to the pandemic and draws lessons for the future.",

            "text": "On 24 April 2009, The World Health Organization (WHO) informed its member states that a novel H1N1 influenza A virus strain had been identified in Mexico and the USA. 1 It did not take long for the virus to be identified in most continents. Although past pandemics had a global impact, their ability to spread was not as rapid as the 2009 (H1N1) pandemic. 2 Two days after the initial detection in Mexico and the USA, the virus was documented in Spain, the first country outside the Americas. Four days later, eight deaths had been confirmed (1-USA and 7-Mexico) and six new countries had been infected including Austria (1), Canada (19) , New Zealand (3), UK (8) , Israel (2) and Switzerland (1) . Due to the rapid spread, the WHO raised the pandemic alert level from level 3 to level 4 on 27 April and 2 days later moved to level 5. 3 On 1 May 2009, the first imported cases were reported in Hong Kong. 4 In just 8 weeks after the initial discovery of the novel virus, the WHO announced on 11 June that this outbreak had met their definition of a pandemic with involvement at that stage of 120 countries and with community transmission documented in three continents. Despite the rapid spread, countries including Mongolia, Rwanda, Sao Tome and Principe did not have confirmed cases until mid-October 2009; this may have been due to limited access to laboratory testing. 5 By January 2010, over 209 countries had reported laboratory confirmed cases and 14 141 deaths (Americas: 7094; Europe: 3099; Southeast Asia: 1366; Western Pacific: 1511). 5 Our response to infectious disease outbreaks is born out of past experience. However, no two outbreaks are the same so an understanding of the infectious agent as well as the environment confronting it is fundamental to the response. This applies whether it is a known or an emerging agent or whether it is a well or under resourced setting. When the agent is a novel virus we are forced to extrapolate from experiences with like-viruses. Health managers quite reasonably prepare for 'worst scenarios'.",

Of course, Armageddon did not happen however, the threat of pandemics will always remain high. 6 In planning for the next pandemic the focus should be on ensuring the response is proportional to the threat and that the impact of unintended consequences is minimized. This will only be possible if the experience gained during the current pandemic, for example the social and economic consequences of isolation and the long-term impact of diverting resources away from other life-threatening illnesses and disease control programs, is evaluated. 7 In addition, the scrutiny of the pandemic response has raised questions about the credibility of decision-making by public health institutions, including WHO and ministries of health. WHO and national governments are undergoing independent reviews of their actions and advice during the pandemic.",

Key health challenges include communication between and within many countries, the differences in levels of funding for health care between countries, access to quality care, health-care worker skills, quality and density and access to essential medicines. Lack of organizational infrastructure for emergency preparedness and response has also been noted. 8 The arrival of this pandemic in Asia was inevitable and the first confirmed case was announced on 1 May 2009 in Hong Kong. A traveller staying in a local hotel was the first detected individual resulting in the hotel becoming an immediate quarantine location. Makeshift quarantine, school closures, border controls and travel restrictions were not far from becoming routine protocols enforced by national authorities across Asia. China detected its first three cases in early May and enforced 1 week of quarantine on close contacts. 9 Singapore practised in-hospital-based quarantine for all its early cases where they were kept until PCR negative. In June, the WHO issued interim guidance on public health measures. 10 By the end of August 2009, 34 026 cases including 64 deaths and 15 771 cases with 139 deaths had been reported in the Western Pacific and South-East Asian regions respectively. 11 Although the number of confirmed cases quickly increased, accuracy in reporting decreased with the recommendation to 'stop testing, just treat when clinically suspected and indicated'. This was made on 16 July 2009, since most influenza like illness (ILI) was by then the outbreak strain of 2009 (H1N1). 12 In some countries testing was preventing early treatment initiation, which was deemed crucial. It was an unnecessary use of resources and only had around 70% sensitivity. 13 The Spanish flu pandemic saw a substantial difference in mortality rates reported between high and low income countries. 14 Similarly, the Americas and Europe had more reported deaths rather than South-East Asia and the Western Pacific for 2009 (H1N1). 11 This is likely to be a result of differences in mortality surveillance across the world. Countries in North America and Europe have established systems for collecting data on influenza-related deaths whereas many developing countries do not have a functioning deaths registration system and are far from having routine ILI mortality surveillance.",

[18] [19] [20] Since the SARS outbreak and with the modern day skills of geographic tracking of a pandemic, it seems that border controls with thermal scanners is the first 'showpiece' of choice. Their international roll out was swift. Such a containment measure may work where infectivity is low and where the infection is only contagious after the onset of the febrile phase but this is not the case with influenza. 21 Entry screening is an easy measure and can be used by governments to portray a sense of control. Entry screening (consisting of temperature check on board, health declaration forms, watching for flu symptoms, thermal scanner for travellers) may lead to short-term delays (7-12 days) in local transmission of a novel strain of influenza virus but the resources required for implementation should be balanced against the expected benefits of entry screening. 22 Unpublished data from Singapore and Vietnam suggest that countries with just one or two international airports may realize delayed community transmission by a few weeks although epidemiological models suggest that border controls are ineffective unless they actually stop travel. 23 In Hong Kong the public approved of government policies including the quarantining of hotel guests. However, misconceptions were prevalent and the public avoided visiting crowded places, as many people wrongly believed that this was a government recommendation. Clear communication, updated scientific information and transparency on government decision-making were insufficient. 23 The criticism over the failure to isolate individuals after their exposure on board a cruise ship in Australia highlighted public and health department concerns and problems of communication in that country. 24 School and workplace education and reminders relating to prevention measures and staying home if sick were widespread. While some school closures were subjective and apparently excessive, it was estimated that transmission was reduced by approximately 25% when secondary schools were closed in Hong Kong. 25 Closing schools is political and emotive. The early concerns over virulent influenza supported any intervention to protect children. 26 As concerns were downgraded; however, it seemed often politically unpalatable to deescalate the will to close schools.",

In addition, this needs to be rapidly fed back to service providers and all stakeholders including the public through the media. Poor data management, failure to carry out systematic risk assessments and risk communications were responsible for misleading media reports which at times influenced decisions. 16, 38 The timeliness of the data management and risk assessments is also essential in identifying unusual clusters (e.g. high death rates) and initiating appropriate responses. 19 Only in this way can a rapid response to viral change be identified during the course of the outbreak. The speed with which H1N1 spread means that unusual reports and clusters need to be identified in real time. 8 The coordination of protocol dissemination and the resources to implement them was a regular issue further highlighting the importance of two-way communication between administration and clinical providers.",

Some countries were found to have an ad hoc system with ventilated beds in quite inappropriate settings. Intensive care units are much more than ventilators alone. Resources and expertise need to be focused in to a small number of institutions first.

Although observational and descriptive studies were undertaken, initiatives to launch randomized controlled trials or more sophisticated pathogenesis studies generally missed the initial waves of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and in many cases failed to enrol sufficient numbers of patients across the clinical spectrum of disease into studies, even during subsequent waves. During the 2009 H1N1 virus pandemic the efforts to prepare for a respiratory disease outbreak allowed a reasonably rapid and coordinated response on epidemiologic and diagnostic aspects of disease but failed in the timely conduct of clinical research aimed at improving patient management and understanding pathogenesis. Interventions including school closures, masks, hand-washing, social distancing and screening at ports of entry were not critically assessed. 43 The optimal antiviral regimen remains unclear particularly in the critically ill, in pregnant women, in obese patients and in the very young. Many commonly debated adjunctive and new therapies were not prospectively assessed. Despite years of apparent preparation and talk, the clinical research community and funding agencies were not ready to respond and missed the opportunity. 44 During the 2009 H1N1 virus pandemic the efforts to prepare for a respiratory disease outbreak allowed a reasonably rapid and coordinated response on epidemiologic and diagnostic aspects of disease but failed in the timely conduct of clinical research aimed at improving patient management and understanding pathogenesis. Indeed, we do not even know precisely why we continue to fail. In almost all recent epidemics (Nipah, SARS, H5N1, outbreaks of VHF or rapid development of drug resistance) very little research aimed at improving clinical management through prospective clinical trials or understanding pathogenesis has been conducted. Poor Institutional Review Board responsiveness and the politics and bureaucracy of research play a role. These experiences have shown that unless something is done, now to change the approach to clinical research in severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and other rapidly evolving public health emergencies the next influenza (or other) epidemic will result in a similar missed opportunity to save lives and advance medical knowledge. We currently have no framework for ensuring research is built into epidemic responses and in fact our present research culture often prevents against a rapid response. Furthermore, from recent epidemics no integrated analyses exist combining microbiological/virological, immunological, clinical, epidemiological, and genetic data for comprehensive assessment of host-emerging pathogen interactions. This is the only real way to best inform prevention and control activities as well as guide clinical management. 45, 46 This will be challenging as there are major clinical, ethical, administrative and organizational constraints. A new paradigm is required to prepare for and respond to rapidly emerging health threats and ensure we build a framework that incorporates and facilitates prospective clinical research and clinical trials during these epidemics. This will need to be done before epidemics and pandemics develop and will require development of agreed protocols with pre-approval from ethical review boards and networks of clinical sites willing to undertake such research. Such protocols should be available freely on line to encourage research. We do not underestimate the challenge of developing such a framework but given the increasing occurrence of these threats and threat to lives we need to do this as a matter of urgency. The Virology, Epidemiology, Emergency Response Groups and Public Health communities have developed much better coordinated systems and collaborative approaches since the epidemics of SARS, H5N1, and these were of great help during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. The clinical research community needs to learn the lessons from these other disciplines and develop similar collaborative approaches.",
