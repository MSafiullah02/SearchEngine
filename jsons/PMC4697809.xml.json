A key mediator of IFN escape is NS5 that contains a C-terminal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and N-terminal RNA methyl-transferase (MTase) and guanylyl-transferase (GTase) activities. The latter two enzymatic activities mediate the capping of the DENV RNA genome in the cytoplasm [22,23], where cellular orthologs of these enzymes are not available [24,25], as well as internal RNA methylation [26]. The latter activity affects the 2\u2019-OH group of the ribose and impedes both the detection of viral RNA by PRRs and its sequestration by the ISG IFIT1 (IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1) [27\u201333]. In addition, NS5 induces the proteasomal degradation of STAT2 [34\u201337] via the interacting host cell protein UBR4 (ubiquitin protein ligase E3 component n-recognin 4) [37], thus preventing ISG induction by IFN.",

On the other hand, DENV potently induces IFNs and other antiviral cytokines and is sensitive to multiple ISGs whose expression confers protection against DENV infection [21,38]. Interestingly, the abrogation of a single escape mechanism, namely the 2\u2019-O-methylation of the viral RNA, strongly attenuates the closely related West Nile virus in vivo [27]. Therefore, DENV mutants unable to perform 2\u2019-O-methylation have been proposed as vaccine candidates [39,40]. However, the mechanisms by which viral 2\u2019-O-methylation mutants of DENV are attenuated are not clear. For the West Nile virus, Daffis and co-workers [27], in agreement with further studies [28,31,41], have described sequestration of mutant virus RNA by IFIT1, but did not detect enhanced IFN expression in response to mutant virus. By contrast, Zust and colleagues, who worked with human and mouse coronaviruses, observed higher type 1 IFN expression induced by mutants lacking 2'-O-methyltransferase activity [29].",

Previous studies reported the sensitivity of DENV replication and virus production to IFN treatment or impairment by IFN-effector proteins under steady-state conditions [34,38,42,43] or visualized either only DENV replication [44] or only the IFN response to a non-spreading virus [45]. Here, we have established a live cell imaging system to monitor simultaneously the dynamics of DENV spread and IFN response and quantified the interplay of these two processes by data-driven mathematical modeling. Our results reveal an early window of opportunity during which the IFN response can curb DENV replication by acting on already infected cells. Thus, the timing of IFN induction is a decisive factor of viral replication and spread that critically determines attenuation of the 2'-O-methylation mutant.",

To study the dynamics of this interplay we utilized A549 cells that are permissive for DENV and capable of producing type 1 and 3 IFNs. In the first set of experiments, we determined the time-dependency of DENV-2 (strain 16681) IFN sensitivity by treating cells with 100 IU/ml IFN-\u03b1 prior to (-4 and -2 h) or after DENV infection (2, 4, 6 and 8 h) with MOI 10 TCID50/cell. Cells were fixed 24 h post infection and the fraction of NS5-expressing cells was determined by immunofluorescence (Fig 1A and 1B). In the absence of IFN treatment, ~60% of the cells were infected. However, pre-treatment of cells with IFN-\u03b1 4 h prior to infection reduced the number of DENV-positive cells to ~15%. This number steadily increased when IFN treatment was delayed until 6 h post infection and, after this time point, inhibition of DENV replication was no longer detectable. A similar time-dependent IFN sensitivity was observed with the same concentration of IFN-\u03b1 after DENV infection with MOI 0.1 TCID50/cell (S1A Fig), a condition used later on in live cell imaging. Measurement of the titers of virus released from cells revealed a ~2 log decrease when cells were treated with IFN-\u03b1 prior to or until 2 h after infection (S1B Fig).",

In agreement with earlier reports [34], Western blot analysis revealed rapid STAT2 degradation that was detectable already 6 h after infection (Fig 1C). From 26 h post infection onwards STAT2 abundance increased again, most likely due to continued growth of uninfected cells expressing normal levels of STAT2 (~40% as deduced from the infection efficiency of cells that had not been treated with IFN; see Fig 1B).

This system allowed the expression of the respective ISGs under control of the authentic gene regulatory elements (used BACs contained 49,417 bp and 84,599 bp upstream of the coding sequence of Mx1 and IFIT1, respectively; Fig 2A). To enable the detection of Mx1 and IFIT1, they were each fused in-frame to the destabilized enhanced green fluorescent protein (deGFP) containing C-terminally the degradation domain of mouse ornithine decarboxylase that was used to reduce stability of the respective ISG (see below). Characterization of stable cell lines A549-Mx1deGFP (S2 Fig) and A549-IFIT1deGFP (Fig 2B) revealed that IFN-treated and deGFP-positive cells indeed contained significantly higher amounts of ISG mRNAs as compared to deGFP-negative cells. Moreover, treatment of A549-IFIT1 reporter cells with IFN-\u03b1 (Fig 2C) or IFN-\u03bb (S3A Fig) showed comparable induction kinetics of the deGFP reporter protein and the corresponding endogenous ISG. Application of biologically equipotent concentrations of IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03bb as determined by hepatitis C virus (HCV) replicon inhibition assay [46], revealed comparable induction kinetics of IFIT1deGFP and Mx1deGFP (Fig 2D and S3B Fig, respectively). In addition, induction of reporter ISGs was dose-dependent both with respect to mean deGFP expression (Fig 2E, left panel) and fraction of deGFP-positive cells (Fig 2E, right panel).

For this reason, we fused these genes C-terminally with deGFP (Fig 2A) and assessed the stability of these fusion proteins by using cycloheximide (CHX) treatment of cells [13,48]. Stable A549 reporter cells were treated with IFN-\u03b1 for 15 h to induce expression of the reporter protein prior to addition of CHX. Cells were harvested at various time points after CHX addition and lysates were analyzed by Western blot or flow cytometry. We determined a half-life of only ~2 h for IFIT1deGFP and ~4 h for Mx1deGFP (Fig 2F, left and right panel, respectively).

However, even at highest IFN-\u03b1 concentration ~5% of cells did not respond, consistent with stochasticity of the IFN response as described earlier [45,46]. To determine whether IFN-\u03b1 responsiveness is a stable property of individual cells, we sorted A549-IFIT1deGFP cells treated with either 10 or 100 IU/ml IFN-\u03b1 into deGFP-expressing and non-expressing fractions. Sorted cells were seeded and treated again with IFN-\u03b1 (Fig 3B). Nearly all cells that had responded to the first IFN-\u03b1 treatment responded to the second treatment, possibly as a result of the higher abundance of signal-transduction molecules such as STAT1/2 and IRF-9 [45,49]. However, cells that did not respond to primary IFN-\u03b1 treatment showed practically the same dose response as na\u00efve cells during primary IFN-\u03b1 application (Fig 3B). This result indicates that a stochastic process is involved in ISG expression.",

Replication fitness and virus production of this reporter genome was only slightly lower as compared to the parental DENV wildtype (DENV-wt) (Fig 4B).

These cytokines were antiviral as inferred from a HCV-based replication inhibition assay, but could be removed by ultracentrifugation of concentrated DENV-faR stocks through a 20% sucrose cushion (S6 Fig). Using these purified virus stocks we assessed the replication properties of DENV-faR by establishing a single-step growth curve in A549 cells (Fig 4C). RNA replication became first detectable ~8 h after inoculation and infectious virus was released into culture supernatant from ~16 h post infection onwards (S7A and S7B Fig), reaching its half-maximum at ~30 h (note that high amounts of viral RNA and infectivity at early time points are due to residual inoculum sticking to cells even after stringent washing). In agreement with these results, we found an increase of IFIT1 mRNA starting 12 h p.i. and release of IFN-\u03bb from 18 h p.i. onwards reaching its half-maximum at 26 h (Fig 4D). We additionally determined the decay of infectious viral particles in the culture medium and found a half-life of 1.7 h (S7C Fig).

In both cell lines DENV-faR-expressing cells were first detected 22 h after infection, reflecting the delay from infection to the rise in intracellular viral RNA and expression of the reporter protein to a detectable level (cf. Fig 4C). Given that infected cells start to produce viral particles from 16 h post infection (cf. Fig 4C and S7B Fig) and that infection takes ~20 h to become visible with the faR reporter, the majority of cells becoming DENV-faR-positive between 36 and 72 h p.i. likely reflects viral spread by secondary infection events. Consistent with these kinetics we found that A549-IFIT1deGFP reporter cells infected with the reporter virus at high MOI (10 TCID50/cell) displayed a faster onset of faR expression concomitant with a lower number of IFIT1deGFP-positive cells, likely as a result of the JAK-STAT signaling block (S9 Fig).",

Based on calculations derived from the histograms, the first onset of ISG-reporter expression was delayed relative to the appearance of DENV-faR-positive cells by 4.75 h, reflecting the minimal time that is required to activate the IFN response by DENV. Previous studies suggested that IFIT1 expression can be stimulated directly by the IRF3 signaling cascade [54,55] and thus, should be induced in DENV-infected cells independent of exogenous IFN. However, in only ~10% of DENV-faR positive cells, we found also IFIT1deGFP expression arguing that IFIT1 expression is induced primarily by IFN, at least in our cell culture system (Fig 5A; S1 Movie). Alternatively, the low expression of IFIT1deGFP in DENV-containing cells might be due to viral blockade of the IRF3 pathway. In contrast to IFIT1, the induction of Mx1 requires IFN [48] and indeed, only very rarely we detected Mx1deGFP\u2013DENV-faR double-positive cells (Fig 5C; S2 Movie). Moreover, the fact that DENV-faR-expressing cells did not induce Mx1deGFP is consistent with an efficient block of JAK-STAT signaling in DENV-infected cells.",

The model takes into account that in infected cells, DENV replicates after a time delay \u03c4\nR (see Fig 4C). After a time delay \u03c4\nV, which considers the additional time necessary for viral protein expression and particle assembly, infectious virions are released. Moreover, infected cells secrete IFN after time delay \u03c4\nF that corresponds to the time necessary for viral recognition, downstream signal transduction as well as IFN-gene transcription, mRNA translation and IFN secretion (Fig 4D). Released IFNs protect susceptible cells (i.e. cells that are sensitive to infection) from infection (solid green arrow in Fig 6A). Importantly, IFNs inhibit virus replication in infected cells if acting early, i.e. prior to DENV-induced shut-off of JAK-STAT signaling (dashed green arrow in Fig 6A; cf. Fig 1A and 1B).",

Fig 4), we can assume spatial mixing of both DENV and IFN over many cell diameters and therefore neglected spatial gradients in the model. Hence, the numbers of susceptible, infected and protected cells and the extracellular concentrations of DENV and IFN are described by a system of delay-differential equations (DDEs) with time delays for virus replication, virus production and IFN secretion (Fig 6A; S1 Supplementary Methods).",

We performed time-resolved flow cytometry measurements (Fig 6B; S10A Fig for the Mx1deGFP reporter) along with quantification of IFN-\u03bb, the most prominent IFN species in this cell system (S8 Fig). For the purpose of parameter estimation, we found time-resolved flow cytometry more informative than live cell imaging, because the former gave an accurate count of susceptible cells (double negative) in addition to infected (DENV-faR positive) and protected (ISG reporter-positive) cells. Similar to the time-lapse microscopy, we observed a strong rise of infected cells with a time delay (~60 h), which, given the low MOI, should be due to secondary spread of the virus from initially infected cells. Cell death was not prominent during the observation period.",

            "text": "To test the validity of the model, we examined three critical parameters using independent experimental data. First, we noted that the delay for intracellular virus replication was estimated from the flow cytometry data to be 24 h (Fig 7A, top row; \u03c4\nR), which equals the delay after which DENV became visible in infected cells by using live cell imaging (Fig 5B and 5D). Second, the delay for the production of DENV particles was 31 h (Fig 7A, top row; \u03c4\nV), which accurately reflects the independently measured half-time of DENV secretion, i.e. the middle of the log phase (Fig 7B). Thus, the delay for virus production in the model corresponds to this half-time rather than the time of first appearance of viral particles (~16 h). Also note that the estimated time difference of ~8 h between the appearance of replicated viral RNA and secreted infectious DENV is consistent with the estimated delays in the experimental data (Fig 4C and S7A and S7B Fig). The fact that the delays for virus replication and production from the model fit match the experimentally observed times at which infected cells become visibly virus-positive (in live cell imaging) and reach their half-maximal virus production rate (as determined by TCID50 assay), indicates that DENV spread requires substantial production of infectious virus particles. As a third test of the model, we considered the simulated response of the cells to an external application of IFN-\u03bb (S3B Fig). Again, the model prediction matches these independent data well (Fig 7C). In summary, the mathematical model agrees with key data obtained in independent experiments that were not used for model fitting.",

By using FACS-based analyses, in both A549-IFIT1deGFP cells (Fig 8B) and A549-Mx1deGFP cells (S10B Fig), we observed a strong reduction of virus spread as compared to the wildtype virus. Moreover, the analogous impairment of spread of this mutant was found when we analyzed the cells by live cell imaging (S11 Fig; S3 and S4 Movies). We reasoned that four key parameters might vary between wildtype DENV and the E217A mutant: As the translation of mutant RNA is impaired because of its sequestration by IFIT1 [41] both the viral production and, possibly, also the delay in virus production after infection could be altered. Moreover, as 2\u2019-O-unmethylated RNA is recognized more readily by Mda5 [29], infected cells might produce IFNs with shorter delay and/or higher rate. To fit the mathematical model to the data obtained with the mutant, we allowed these rates and delays of virus production and IFN secretion to be mutant-specific, but otherwise used the parameters previously established for wildtype DENV. We found agreement of the model with the data (Fig 8C) and, using profile-likelihood analysis, established confidence bounds on the mutant-specific parameters (Fig 8D; S2 Table). Only two out of these four parameters differed strongly from the wildtype value: the virus production rate was decreased 8-fold for the E217A mutant and the delay from infection to IFN production was decreased 4-fold, by ~24 h. Importantly, for the mutant DENV, IFN production sets in prior to virus production whereas the timing of the two events roughly coincides for the wildtype.",

Specifically, the IFN production delay and the virus production rate might not be independent parameters (as assumed for simplicity in the previous analysis), because virus replication could be affected by IFN in a time-dependent manner through the early induction of ISGs before STAT2 degradation takes effect (see Fig 1). To account for this possibility, we extended the mathematical model (Fig 9A): The inhibition of virus production by IFN was described explicitly and could take place through ISG induction in an initial phase after infection (Fig 9A, solid green inhibition link), assumed to be 8 h. Compared to Fig 1B, this somewhat extended time window accounts for the fact that the initial infection dose in the time-course experiments (Figs 6B and 8B) is much lower, likely delaying the average onset of viral replication. If an infected cell does not perceive IFN within this time period, it becomes a virus producer, albeit with a somewhat reduced production rate (~50% of wildtype DENV), to account for the possibility that basal IFIT1 expression inhibits translation of DENV mutant RNA. With these modifications (S3 Table), the model fitted the kinetics of both wildtype and mutant DENV replication and IFN response as before (Fig 8C), but could now account for ISG induction and the resulting inhibition of viral replication within an early window of opportunity after infection.",

            "text": "These computational results indicate that IFN can quench DENV spread by reducing the viral production rate early on in infected cells. While early IFN production by the E217A DENV mutant enables this effect, IFN production in response to the wildtype virus sets in too late for quenching virus production. We then asked how robust these conclusions are, given that the model has been parameterized using a specific experimental setting. Therefore, we systematically varied each model parameter and quantified its effect on the extent of viral spread, using the response coefficients R\ni defined as ratio of the fold change of virus-infected cells to the fold change of model parameter i. The spread of wildtype virus is controlled only by virus-related processes: production, decay in the medium and infection of susceptible cells (Fig 9C; note that a negative response coefficient implies that viral spread decreases as the respective parameter is increased). The parameters of the IFN response do not have a noticeable effect on viral spread, including faster (paracrine) protection of susceptible cells (r\nF). This is in stark contrast to the E217A mutant where the timing of the IFN response (\u03c4\nF) and the time window during which IFN can act on infected cells (\u03c4\nP) have the dominant control on viral spread (Fig 9D). The dependence of spread of the E127A mutant on the parameters of virus production and infection is very similar to wildtype virus. Together, the results of this sensitivity analysis of the model show that (1) viral spread is consistently controlled by the rates of virus production and infection and (2) a sufficiently early, autocrine IFN response, as elicited by the E217A mutant, curbs DENV spread.",

Thus, a large fraction of cells neither becomes infected by the virus nor protected by upregulation of ISGs, implying that the availability of susceptible cells is not a limiting factor for the spread of mutant DENV. This observation is consistent with the live cell imaging results showing that antiviral protection is always incomplete due to high cell-to-cell heterogeneity in the induction of ISGs (Fig 5).",

In agreement with our model prediction, we observed strong attenuation of replication and virus production of the E217A mutant in A549 cells whereas in BHK-21 cells this impairment as measured by the limiting dilution assay was almost 75-fold lower (Fig 10B). Consistent with this result, we found that 72 h post electroporation, the E217A mutant had infected ten times less A549 cells than wildtype virus whereas the respective reduction in BHK-21 cells was only fourfold (Fig 10C). The low-level reduction of mutant virus production in BHK-21 cells might be due to IFN-independent expression of IFIT1 that blocks translation of 2\u2019-O-non-methylated RNA [54].",

We infected the cells with high MOI to monitor the replication kinetics of the three DENV-faR reporter viruses largely independent from virus spread. We found that kinetics of virus replication and activation of the IFN response were well comparable between the wildtype and the NS4B mutant P23A (S12A and S12B Fig). Consistent with our live cell imaging data, replication of the E217A 2\u2019-O-methyltransferase mutant was very much reduced and only ~10% of cells were faR positive 96 h post infection, in contrast to ~60% in case of wildtype and the NS4B mutant (S12C Fig). Moreover, in spite of this low number of E217A mutant-positive cells, ~90% of the cells mounted an IFN response which was ~20% higher than in cell cultures infected with the wildtype or the NS4B mutant 96 h post infection. Thus, the enhanced IFN sensitivity of the DENV 2\u2019-O-methyltransferase mutant is a unique property that is not linked to replication fitness.",

This IFN response likely is too high and too fast for the virus to establish IFN resistance, e.g. by quantitative STAT2 degradation, thus accounting for the serious impairment of replication fitness of this mutant in an IFN-competent system. It is also for this reason that paracrine IFN action plays a minor, if any, role as virus production rate is reduced so profoundly that virus spread remains limited.",

            "text": "The outcome of virus infections, either rapid control or spreading, very much depends on the kinetics of replication of a given virus and activation of the innate antiviral defense. Although this is a well-established paradigm in virology, most studies are based on measurements under steady-state conditions and only rarely take into account the dynamics of virus replication/spread as well as the kinetics of activation and stochasticity of the IFN response. Several earlier reports demonstrated that induction of ISGs rendered cultured cells resistant against DENV infection [38,42,62], but the kinetics of activation of the antiviral state in relation to virus replication and spread have not been quantified in a single system. To overcome this limitation, in the present study we established BAC-based IFN-competent reporter cell lines that allow monitoring of DENV replication and spread, as well as activation of the IFN response in live cells. We chose two different markers: first, IFIT1 that appears to be activated in an IRF3-dependent manner; second Mx1 that is induced exclusively by IFN, thus serving as selective marker for an intact JAK-STAT signaling pathway [55] (reviewed in [63]). By using live cell microscopy we observed profound heterogeneity of the IFN response at the single cell level arguing, for a stochastic response. This observation is in good agreement with earlier reports describing heterogeneous induction of the IFNB1 gene upon viral infection [58,64\u201367] or IFN treatment [46]. Moreover, a recent study identified an \u201call-or-nothing\u201d expression of IFN-\u03b2 and ISGs induced by infection of mouse cells with Newcastle disease virus and differing between individual cells [45]. Consistent with our data this study showed that one IFN-secreting cell protects a large number of na\u00efve cells by induction of ISG expression. However, Rand and co-workers utilized an avian virus that did not spread in the murine cell culture and therefore could not identify the contribution of autocrine and paracrine IFN response to curbing the spread of infection. We found that owing to stochasticity the IFN response is \u201cleaky\u201d. Thus, a fraction of non-protected cells remains that supports virus replication. While in the case of DENV these cells will undergo apoptosis as a result of viral replication, in the case of persistent virus infections such as those caused by HCV, this stochasticity might play an important role for chronicity [46]. The molecular determinants underlying the stochastic nature of the IFN response are poorly explored, but likely due to limiting amounts of factors involved in IFN perception, signal transduction or transcription of ISGs.",

            "text": "Mathematical modeling of viral infections has a rich tradition [56,68], but models that include the immune response explicitly have primarily focused on the adaptive immune response [69]. By comparison, the initial phase during which an invading virus must overcome the innate immune response to spread has rarely been addressed [70\u201373] and experimental data for the parameterization of such models have been scarce. Here we have developed a mathematical model for the dynamic interaction of viral spread and the IFN response and identified all model parameters from a consistent set of experimental data based on DENV infection of IFN-competent human cells. The model specifically studies spreading infections that originate from few initially infected cells, thus using experimental data with low MOI. In high MOI infections, the initial virus load of the infected cells is expected to be more heterogeneous, which might be more accurately described by more complex, agent-based simulation models. The model also abstracts from several details. Notably, the spatial heterogeneity of cell responses observed in our live cell imaging analysis has not been described explicitly, because on the relevant time scale for virus replication and host gene expression, all cells in the culture are likely to be confronted with spatially averaged virus and IFN concentrations [58,59]. This might change in densely crowded tissues where the slowing of both viral spread and IFN diffusion could cause, at least initially, more localized infections and IFN responses [71,74]. A related aspect is the stochasticity of the IFN response that we have characterized both by flow cytometry and live cell imaging. The model accounts for the observation that ISG induction occurs in individual cells at very different times even after uniform IFN treatment. This is naturally reflected in the slow rate of ISG induction (see Fig 7C for a comparison of model and data), which will appear stochastic at the single cell level.",

            "text": "The model based on kinetics of wildtype DENV replication and IFN induction predicted two synergistic effects that account for attenuation of the 2\u2019-O-methylation deficient mutant: first, reduced production of virus particles likely resulting from the antiviral activity of IFIT1; second, accelerated kinetics of IFN activation. Indeed, by using time-resolved flow cytometry we validated these predictions and observed faster cytokine production in the case of the mutant (compare Fig 6B with Fig 8B; see also S10 Fig). Importantly, this mutant has no general defect in RNA replication, because replication and virus production were much less reduced in IFN-incompetent BHK-21 cells as compared to IFN-competent A549 cells. The reduction of the mutant in BHK-21 cells might be due to low basal expression level of IFIT1 that binds RNA lacking 2\u2019-O-methylation and blocks its translation by competing with translation factor EIF4E for mRNA templates [27\u201333,41]. However, in IFN-competent cells, the 2\u2019-O-unmethylated RNA induces a much faster IFN response. By using our data-based model, we calculated a ~24 h advance in the onset of IFN secretion in the mutant compared to the wildtype (Fig 8D). It is plausible to assume that the delay observed with the mutant is too short to mount an IFN-resistant state in the infected cells, which requires sufficient expression of, amongst others, NS5 and quantitative degradation of STAT2 (reviewed in [7]). As a consequence, cells infected with the mutant are exposed to IFN at a time when they are still IFN responsive, thus causing a profound reduction of virus production rate. In the case of the wildtype, recognition of viral (2\u2019-O-methylated) RNA is inefficient and therefore, the IFN response is induced at a later time point when high amounts of single strand viral genomes or double strand replication intermediates have accumulated. By this time, JAK-STAT signaling would already be shut down and therefore, IFN would not impact viral replication in these already unresponsive infected cells.",

Given the slower activation kinetics of the IFN response, the time period available to produce progeny wildtype virus without impact of autocrine IFN is much longer and thus, virus spread is much more extended. Therefore, second round infections can occur fast enough before a robust antiviral state has been established in susceptible cells by paracrine IFN action, especially in the subpopulation of na\u00efve cells with slow IFN response. According to our live cell imaging data ~5% of cells respond to IFN even later than 24 h after exposure to the cytokine (Fig 3D). This number is consistent with the fraction of double positive cells we observed by flow cytometry (Fig 6B).",

Obviously, the next step will be to integrate the intracellular steps of DENV replication, e.g. by using mathematical models analogous to the one we recently established for HCV [75]. Computation of processes in the DENV replication cycle, which are most amenable to antiviral treatment and/or most sensitive to the IFN-induced antiviral state should allow predicting best synergies between antiviral drugs and the (innate) immune response. In this respect, the results described here should foster development of novel antiviral concepts to combat DENV infection and help to understand the mechanisms of attenuation underlying engineered DENV vaccine candidates.",
