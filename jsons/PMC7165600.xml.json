In fact, vegetation groups are determined by the combined effects of a whole range of ecological factors. Thus, change in the soil, topography and grazing factors can lead to vegetation responses in each area of the landscape (Holechek et al. 1989). Jangman et al. (1995) showed that vegetation ordination can be used to generate the ecological factor classes in each site. Plant species that appear in similar regions have equal ecologic requirements and can be defined as \u201cecological species groups\u201d. The regions that contain similar ecological species groups create ecological groups that are homogeneous habitats with similar ecologic and floristic composition, which can be used in habitat classification (Zahedi and Mohammadi 2002; Kashian 2003; Kooch et al. 2008).",

Some of these methods for investigation of relationships between plant species or communities with ecological parameters are direct and indirect gradient analyses (Jangman et al. 1987; Zahedi 1998; Villers\u2010ruiz et al. 2003; Jalilvand et al. 2007). In direct gradient analysis, ecological data ordination is based on vegetation data and plant species distribution in relation to ecological parameters, whereas indirect gradient analysis is based on floristic data analysis without the effect of ecological factors. The ecological factors will be apparent only after analysis of floristic change. The ecological data are entered into the analysis in the interpretation step (Austin 1968; Moghaddam 2001; Jafarian Jelodar 2008).",

            "text": "The DCA method is an indirect method to show species correlation. This method arranges vegetation data based on their presence or absence in sampling plots and shows species group locations at each site. First, this method calculates the magnitude of species composition change in the first ordination axis (lengths of gradient). Based on the calculated gradient, the type of analysis to be used for ordination is determined (\u22653 for CCA, <3 for RDA). Species group separation is clearer in DCA. Furthermore, a group\u2019s border isn\u2019t always identifiable in CCA or RDA. Although, for determining the relationship between species and environmental data, direct methods are the best methods of ordination, DCA is more useful in species grouping (Hill and Gauch 1980; Jean and Bouchard 1993). The combination of CCA and RDA is the complement of DCA. These new techniques select the linear combination of environmental variables that maximize species scores, whereas CCA chooses the best weights for the environmental variables (Zahedi 1998). This gives the first CCA axis. In CCA, composite gradients are linear combinations of environmental variables, giving a much simpler analysis that provides a summary of the species\u2013environment relationships. In vector diagrams, vector lengths show the efficacy of each factor, with a longer length indicating a stronger relationship. Also, closeness of species to a vector shows its responsiveness to that factor. Occurrence of a species near a vector indicates a positive relationship with that factor and its diminished relationship with the other factors (Jangman et al. 1987; Ghorbani et al. 2003).",

Then, the information layers of slope, aspect, hypsography and lithology were created in GIS (Arc View 3.3). The geomorphologic land units (n = 66) map was obtained by overlaying the slope, aspect, hypsometric and lithologic layers (Figure 2). From these land units nine, with similar lithology and altitude (2100\u20132200 m a.s.l.) but contrasting slopes and aspects, were selected. Some of the selected units shown in Figure 2 were merged because of their close similarities in most factors. Except in one land unit where 40 plots were sampled, sampling was conducted at 30 randomly chosen plots of 1 m2 within each of the nine land units. Size and number of plots were obtained by minimal area and statistical methods, respectively (Kent and Coker 1996). Topographic (slope and aspect) and vegetative characteristics (species names, cover, density and frequency percentage) were recorded by visual scores and subsequent calculations within each plot. Aspect data were calculated by angle conversion to northing; Heat Load = [1 \u2212 cos(\u03b8 \u2212 45)]/2 where \u03b8 is the aspect value based on 360\u00b0 with the highest heat being in the southwest quadrant. Soil samples were taken from 0\u201320 cm and 20\u201350 cm depths in each plot. Sub samples from well\u2010mixed soil layers were analyzed for texture (Gee and Bauder 1982), calcium carbonate (Nelson 1982), organic matter (Nelson and Sommers 1982), bulk density (Black and Hartge 1982), total nitrogen (Bremner and Mulvaney 1982), available phosphorus (Olsen and Sommers 1982) and available potassium (Knudson and Peterson 1982).",

Where significant relationships were found, two dimensional diagrams of species and environmental parameters were developed (Jangman et al. 1995).

In this case, the Group 1 invader species demonstrated the least reaction to these factors because the species of this group were all located close to the origin of coordinates and were not along the environmental gradient in two axes. However, these species were located some distance along the soil texture (silt and clay) and bulk density vectors (Figure 4). Also, their distribution is inversely related to soil elements (N, P, K), OC, sand, aspect and slope vectors. There were invader species such as Cirsium arvense, Centaurea solstitialis, Gundelia tournefortii, Eryngium caeruleum, Marrubium vulgare, Phlomis herba\u2010venti, Euphorbia cheiradenia, Taraxacum vulgare and two species of Stachys genus in this group that Stachys spp. and Euphorbia cheiradenia are native plants but others are exotic. This is indicative of the intensive grazing pressure on this habitat since grazing animals deplete soil fertility in this environment (Toit et al. 2009). Moreover, low P soils on moderate slopes are likely caused by fertility transfer to flatter sites (Arzani et al. 2007). Livestock trampling under intensive grazing habitats has also increased soil bulk density (Han et al. 2008) and probably resulted in a mix of topsoil and subsurface soils as seen by the altered physical, chemical and biological properties, each of which can influence seed germination and survival (De Falco et al. 2009). On the other hand, the absence of distinct relationships between this group of invader species and abiotic factors is related to the absence of similar environmental factors because the effect of intensive grazing (as a human factor) has invoked other environmental factors, which have rearranged the ecological balance in these sections (Ghorbani et al. 2003; Jafari et al. 2004). This finding confirms that of Andrieu et al. (2007) which found that invader species become abundant in these landscapes irrespective of local ecological conditions.",

Because these grass species are sensitive to high grazing pressure, their distribution is restricted to low\u2010intensity grazed landscapes, where soil fertility (nitrogen, potassium and organic matter) is sufficient to support good pasture production (Xie and Wittig 2004). This is likely because grazing stimulates plant regrowth and absorption of soil nutrients. Also, erosion in intensively grazed landscapes depletes soil elements and decreases soil fertility (Dormaar and Willms 1998; Hosseinzadeh 2006). Animal treading damage can result in decreased soil porosity (increased soil bulk density). This limits sustainability of sensitive species such as grasses in more heavily grazed sites (Arzani et al. 2007). On the other hand, while not measured in this experiment, a higher soil moisture content on northern aspects (in the northern hemisphere) should improve conditions for grass abundance (Taghipour 2005; Mirdavoodi et al. 2007). High soil pH (high CaCO3) is also a known limiting factor for growth of grasses (Jafari et al. 2003). In conclusion, we believe the grasses in Group 2 (Figure 3) are so grouped, as a response to high soil fertility, low pH, high soil moisture regime and low grazing intensity.",

These landscapes maintain a higher soil moisture regime than southern aspects, causing broad\u2010leaved species to abound (Zahedi and Mohammadi 2002; Shokri et al. 2003; Khademolhosseini et al. 2007).",

Soil (49%) and topographic (15%) factors explain much of the total variance relating to whether ecological groups are present in the landscape. The combined effect of soil and topography explains only a further approximately 5% of the plant groups presence in the landscape. Therefore, Axis 1 was relates to slope, aspect and soil organic matter, while Axis 2 represents soil texture (sand, silt and clay, Figure 4). We assume that the remaining variation arose from biotic factors (especially grazing). Although grazing was not considered a variable in these analyses, the effect of grazing on plant composition and soil properties in the landscape is undeniable (Han et al. 2008; Pei et al. 2008). This grazing effect appears to account for the appearance of Group 1 species as invader species.",

Also, an apparently high grazing intensity (increased bulk density and elevated soil fertility status) increased soil compaction and decreased the presence of the native grasses. These changes, with physiographic effects, are important reasons for variations in soil fertility. These effects result in changing vegetation communities, which includes the opportunity for ingress of invader plants. Plant community species alter ecological relationships that can create new landscapes. Identification of these species and understanding of their relationships with environmental parameters can help range management planning. In this way, the use of multivariate analyses (DCA and CCA) can be useful to describe species variation. In new research, grazing intensity should also be measured and used as an environmental variable in these multivariate analyses.",
