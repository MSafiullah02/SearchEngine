We analyse data of COVID-19 symptoms, as self-reported in a weekly online survey, which is open to all Belgian citizens. We predict symptoms' incidence using binomial models for spatially discrete data, and we introduce these as a covariate in the spatial analysis of COVID-19 incidence, as reported by the Belgian government during the days following a survey round. The symptoms' incidence predictions explain a significant proportion of the variation in the relative risks based on the confirmed cases, and exceedance probability maps of the symptoms' incidence and the confirmed cases' relative risks pinpoint the same high-risk region. We conclude that these results can be used to develop public monitoring tools in scenarios with limited lab testing capacity, and to supplement test-based information otherwise. * Corresponding author; I-BioStat,",

Due to various further introductions, the disease spread throughout the country. The Belgian government has undertaken several measures to slow down community transmission, the most notable of which has been the implementation of a lockdown of the country on March 18, 2020. Due to limited capacity, only a fraction of suspected Belgian COVID-19 patients has been tested to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection.

This might be explained by the quarantine measures that obstruct typical transmission routes, such that infection mostly occurs very localised (Ganyani et al. 2020) . However, what is defined as small-scale spatial variation depends on the spatial resolution of data; in order to develop COVID-19 monitoring tools, analysts will need spatial information on finer scales than the municipality or postal code level. Furthermore, similarly to the previous conclusions with respect to rounds 2 and 4 of the survey, the relatively small sample sizes in the southern part of Belgium for the symptoms data likely hamper the detection of high-incidence areas in the analysis of round 3 as well. This highlights the need for investments in monitoring tools, and promotional campaigns to engage the general public throughout the 14 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",
