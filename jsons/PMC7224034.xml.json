            "text": "Rotaviruses belong to the Reoviridae family and contain genomes consisting of eleven segments of dsRNA. The International Committee of Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) recognized eight species within the rotavirus genus: Rotavirus A, B, C, D, E. F, G, and H (Attoui et al. 2012). Viruses of the rotavirus group A (RVA) species had been the most widely studied, owing to their significance as the prime cause of severe diarrhea in infants and young children (Greenberg and Estes 2009). Rotaviruses group A were further classified into different G and P genotypes based on the molecular characterization of the outer capsid proteins, VP7 (glycoprotein) and VP4 (protease-sensitive, which was cleaved into VP5 and VP8 by trypsin) respectively (Matthijnssens et al. 2011). There are at least 51 P genotypes and 36 G genotypes of rotaviruses A recognized in humans and animals (https://rega.kuleuven.be/cev/viralmetagenomics/virus-classification/rcwg) (accessed on Nov. 7, 2019). The most prevalent rotavirus genotypes detected around the world include four common human G genotypes (G1, G2, G3, G4) in association with the most common human P genotypes P[4], P[6], and P[8] (B\u00e1nyai et al. 2012; Chen et al. 2012). The four common G genotypes (G1-G4) and the three common P genotypes (P[8], P[4] and P[6]) represented approximately 93% and 99% of the rotavirus reports in South Korea respectively (Than and Kim 2013). In Turkey, the four common G genotypes along with G9 accounted for 97.8% while the three common P genotypes represented more than 99% of rotavirus strains (Durmaz et al. 2014). The most common G/P genotypes combinations infecting humans worldwide were G1P[8], G2P[4], G3P[8], G4P[8], G9P[8], and G12P[8]. These genotypes were responsible for almost 90% of rotavirus infections worldwide (Matthijnssens and Van Ranst 2012; Li et al. 2016).",

Thus, continuous surveillance of rotavirus genotypes is required to determine if the live attenuated oral vaccines could be used to cover the common genotypes circulating in the Egyptian infants. Furthermore, these vaccines had been associated with a low risk of intussusceptions which is believed to be triggered by the replication of the oral vaccines (Carlin et al. 2013; Weintraub et al. 2014; Yih et al. 2014; Yen et al. 2016). Also, these vaccines may be associated with other issues related to live vaccines including the risk of introduction of vaccine strains into the environment, genetic reassortment between the vaccine and a wild type strain, and reversion of the vaccine strain toward virulence (Lappalainen et al. 2015). This has stimulated interest in an alternative, non-living parenteral approach to immunization. Our group (Food-Borne Viruses Group, NRC) aimed to develop a parenteral, non-living recombinant subunit rotavirus vaccine and we need to determine the most common Egyptian antigens required for formulation of this vaccine. Thus, there is a need to determine the most common G and P genotypes circulating in Egyptian infants and children to suggest a vaccine that will cover the most circulating G and P genotypes in Egypt. The present study was conducted to estimate the burden of rotavirus gastroenteritis as well as to compare the prevalence of rotavirus common G and P genotypes among children \u2264 5 years of age visiting Abo El-Reech hospital (from Oct. 2015 to Sep. 2017) and in raw sewage samples collected from WWTPs in Greater Cairo during winter and autumn months in the same period to determine the most common G and P genotypes for future vaccine development. Additional objective was to estimate the silent and non-silent mutations in the human rotavirus VP8 partial gene in clinical specimens and raw sewage samples.",

VP8* cDNA was synthesized by using Superscript III (Invitrogen) and reaction parameters were as follows: 50\u2013200 ng of genomic RNA was denatured with a final concentration of 15% DMSO and incubated at 94 \u00b0C for 3 min, followed by chilling immediately. The first strand cDNA was synthesized following manufacturer's instructions. The products of RT reaction were used as templates for PCR using an iProof High-Fidelity PCR system (Bio-Rad) to amplify the truncated VP8* fragments of rotaviruses with P[8], P[4], and P[6] specificity. The PCR products of positive VP8* fragments of rotaviruses P[8], P[4], and P[6] were sequenced. Fifty to one hundred \u00b5l of the PCR products were purified using a high pure PCR products purification kit (Qiagen) and following the manufacturer's instructions. Sequencing was performed on 1\u20137 \u00b5l of the purified products with an API prism Big dye termination cycle sequencing ready reaction kit (Applied Biosystem) using the same primers as in the PCR and following the manufacturer's instructions. The DNA was sequenced with an API prism 310 automated DNA sequencer. Sequence analysis was conducted to examine the silent and non-silent mutations in the amplified truncated VP8* fragments. Sequence analysis was conducted also to examine the phylogenetic and the evolutionary relationship between the Egyptian common P-typeable isolates and the vaccine strains of both Rotarix\u00ae and RotaTeq\u00ae vaccines and with some reference strains recorded in the GenBank. Strains were determined by BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search tool) accessible at https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi from National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Sequences were aligned along with other reference rotavirus sequences retrieved from GenBank using CLUSTAL W program in Mega X software (https://www.megasoftware.net). A neighbor joining tree was constructed with 1000 bootstrap replicates using Mega X software (https://www.megasoftware.net).",

Thus, this hospital can be used as an excellent model for rotavirus prevalence in Egyptian infants and children. In the present study, the frequency of rotavirus in diarrheal samples which collected from Abo El-Reech hospital from Oct. 2015 to Sep. 2017 was 24.37%. Rotaviruses were detected with higher frequency during autumn and winter months. A higher occurrence of group A rotavirus infections was observed from Nov. 2015 to Jan. 2016 and from Nov. 2016 to Jan. 2017 with highest percentage of prevalence rate of up to 35.90% and 35.59% in Jan. 2016 and Jan. 2017 respectively. The infection rate decreased during spring and summer months suggesting that the rotavirus group A infection rate was low and that gastroenteritis during this period may be caused by other pathogens. These results were confirmed with several previous studies (Dhital et al. 2017; Saudy et al. 2017). In another study, prevalence of rotavirus group A was investigated in 92 stool specimens collected from Mansoura University Children's Hospital, Egypt (Sep. 2010 to Feb. 2012) by RT-PCR. Rotavirus group A was detected in 48.90% of the cases. The Rotavirus negative cases (51.10%) included 34 (37.00%) patients had bacterial pathogens and 13 patients (14.10%) had no detectable pathogen. They found rotavirus diarrhea to be occurred mostly in the autumn and winter months, while most rotavirus negative cases were recorded in summer (Saudy et al. 2017). The present results agree also with those of Dhital et al. (2017) who collected 717 diarrheal stool samples from two hospitals situated in Kathmandu city, capital of Nepal, from January to November 2014. They detected rotavirus in 22.90% (161/717) of patients. The highest number of diarrhea was seen in January.",

This age distribution is in agreement with (Junaid et al. 2011) who reported that most of the infected children were under 2 years of age with the highest prevalence between 7\u201312 months. In the present study, rotavirus positivity rate was lower among children \u2264 6-month-old (18.31%). This lower incidence rate might be due to passive immunity acquired by the infants from their mothers which wades off after 6 months. This was also confirmed by (Rodrigues et al. 2007). In the present study, rotavirus infections were not observed in children older than 24 months. These may be attributed to the lower number of specimens collected from children older than 2 years. Another probability may be that infections with rotavirus decrease with increasing age over two years. Dian and co-workers (2017) noted that children less than 2 years of age were accounted for 87.40% (4712/5394) of the total infections and the infection rate showed an overall declining trend with increasing age after 36 months.

            "text": "Our results of studying rotavirus G and P genotyping in positive rotavirus VP6 clinical specimens showed significant higher prevalence of common P genotypes than common G genotypes and this may reflect their prevalence in the Egyptian community. The significant higher prevalence of common P genotypes than common G genotypes was also observed in the raw sewage samples. The raw sewage samples were collected in autumn and winter months which represent the peak of prevalence of rotavirus in the aquatic environment either in Egypt (Villena et al. 2003; El-Senousy et al. 2004, 2013a, 2014a, b, 2015; El-Senousy and El-Mahdy 2009) or worldwide (Li et al. 2011; Barril et al. 2015; Zhou et al. 2016). It may give an indication about the significant higher prevalence of uncommon G genotypes than uncommon P genotypes in Egyptian clinical and environmental samples and consequently in the Egyptian community. The higher prevalence of common P genotypes than common G genotypes in Egyptian infants agree with reports from other African countries but with different proportion in prevalence (Ouermi et al. 2017; Lartey et al. 2018; Tagbo et al. 2019). Ouermi et al. (2017) provided a comprehensive view of the current circulating rotavirus strains in Africa (2006\u20132016) which is important in light of the new rotavirus vaccinations. They reported that almost all the African regions showed the same predominant genotypes with some variations in prevalence. Genotypes G1, G2, G3, G9 and G12 accounted for 75.94% of all G genotypes circulating in Africa, whereas genotypes P[4], P[6], and P[8] were predominant and accounted for 82.94% of the P genotypes encountered. The difference in circulating strains is not surprising given that genotypes vary much from one country to another and from one region to another. In Ghana, Lartey and co-workers (2018) studied the molecular characterization of 1363 rotavirus positive diarrheic stool samples (from children under-five-years old) from Jan. 2009 to Dec. 2016. The most common G genotypes detected during the entire period were G1 (30.70%), G12 (13.80%), G3 (12.10%) and G2 (10.70%), while the most commonly detected P genotypes were P[8] (37.80%), P[6] (31.60%), and P[4] (8.90%). In Mozambique, 157 rotavirus positive clinical specimens collected between 2012 and 2013 from children under-five-years old were tested for G and P genotyping prior to vaccine introduction. Genotypes G2 (32.40%), G12 (28.00%), P[4] (41.40%), and P[6] (22.90%) strains were commonly detected (Joao et al. 2018). The higher prevalence of common P genotypes than common G genotypes in Egyptian raw sewage samples agrees with the results reported by (El-Senousy and Abou-Elela 2017) who studied the rotavirus genotypes in a pilot wastewater treatment plant in Egypt and their results showed that G1 was the most frequent common G genotype while P[8] and P[4] were the most frequent common P genotypes in the sewage samples. It agrees also with reports from Tunisia where rotavirus group A could be genotyped for G and P genotypes in 228 and 247 out of 375 rotavirus positive sewage samples respectively. Genotypes G1 (29.10%), P[8] (32.00%), and P[4] (27.70%) were commonly detected (Hassine-Zaafrane et al. 2015). In Argentina, rotavirus G genotypes and P genotypes could be characterized in 29 (82.86%) and 22 (62.80%) respectively out of the 35 raw sewage samples collected monthly from Feb. 2009 to Dec. 2011. The most common G genotypes detected during the entire period were G1 (32.20%), G2 (23.70%), and G9 (22.00%), while the most common P genotypes detected were P[8] (67.90%) and P[4] (32.10%) (Barril et al. 2015). Our results showed a strong relationship between the prevalence of common P and G genotypes in both clinical specimens and raw sewage samples. Common P genotypes were significantly higher than common G genotypes in the positive rotavirus VP6 clinical specimens and raw sewage samples. The percentage of common P genotypes in the raw sewage samples (87.50%) was increased in comparison to the results of Villena and co-workers (2003) which common P genotypes were detected in 73.33% of the positive raw sewage samples collected from Greater Cairo in 1998\u20131999. P[4] genotype was the most prevalent genotype in our results followed by P[8] and finally P[6] in both clinical specimens and environmental samples although it was next to P[8] and P[6] genotypes in the results of Villena and co-workers (2003). Increasing the percentage of frequency of P[4] genotype was observed in the Egyptian investigated samples (clinical and environmental) through 20 years (1998\u20132017) in several studies (Villena et al. 2003; El-Senousy et al. 2004, 2014a; El-Esnawy et al. 2010; El-Senousy and Abou-Elela 2017). This may return to the ability for reassortment of the rotavirus genome or increasing the rate of infection with rotavirus strains contained genotype P[4] in the Egyptian community. The rate of viral presence in the aquatic environment as a result of its presence in the community (infected or carrier persons) and also its resistance to environmental conditions and consequently its long persistence may increase the chance for genome reassortment. All these conditions were observed through a lot of studies concerned with rotaviruses in the Egyptian aquatic environment (Villena et al. 2003; El-Senousy et al. 2004, 2013a, 2014a, b, c, d, 2015; El-Senousy and El-Mahdy 2009; El-Senousy and Abou-Elela 2017). The increased frequency of P[4] genotype in the Egyptian clinical and environmental samples may be the reason of increasing the percentage of the common P genotypes in the clinical and environmental samples in our study. The percentage of common G genotypes in the raw sewage samples (54.17%) was decreased in comparison to the results of Villena and co-workers (2003) which common G genotypes were detected in 63.91% of the positive rotavirus VP6 raw sewage samples. This may return to increasing the percentage of uncommon G genotypes which G9 was detected in our results in 16.67% of the rotavirus VP6 positive raw sewage samples, although it was detected in 12.43% of the rotavirus VP6 positive samples in the study of Villena and co-workers (2003) which G9 was detected as an emergence of a new strain either in Egyptian clinical or environmental samples. This was supported by our results of clinical specimens which G9 was detected in 31 specimens (12.40%). Decreasing the rate of infection with the common G genotypes in the Egyptian community may be another reason. Radwan and co-workers (1997) reported that 39.00% of the clinical specimens collected from Cairo (1992\u20131993) were untypeable for common G genotypes. Although it is a high percentage of untypeable G specimens, it is less than the percentage of untypeable G specimens in our present study. G1 was the highest prevalent common G genotype through all the previous studies concerned with rotaviruses in the aquatic environment and in our present study in both clinical specimens and raw sewage samples. G3 was second to G1 in the present study in both clinical specimens and raw sewage samples. In the study of Villena and co-workers (2003), the prevalence of G3 was also second to G1 in the raw sewage samples of Greater Cairo in 1998\u20131999. Raw sewage represents the reservoir of the enteric viruses (pathogens). It receives the feces contained enteric viruses (pathogens) excreted by infected persons or carriers. Raw sewage also could be considered as a source of infection for other persons by contamination of either drinking water resources or irrigation water and consequently freshly eaten crops (El-Senousy et al. 2013b, 2013e). Raw sewage could be considered as a mirror reflects the levels and types of viruses (pathogens) circulating in the community.",

            "text": "In 2006, pivotal clinical trials of 2 live oral rotavirus vaccines\u2014a pentavalent bovine\u2013human reassortant vaccine given in a 3-dose schedule (Rotateq\u00ae, Merck & Co), and a monovalent human vaccine given in a 2-dose schedule (Rotarix\u00ae, GSK Biologicals)- demonstrated good efficacy (85.00\u201398.00%) in preventing severe rotavirus gastroenteritis in developed countries (Ruiz-Palacios et al. 2006; Vesikari et al. 2006). Subsequent trials in Africa showed a more modest efficacy (59.00\u201364.00%) but given the large disease burden in these regions, the vaccine prevented more disease than in lower burden settings (Armah et al. 2010; Madhi et al. 2010). Reports from different African countries showed that the RotaTeq\u00ae vaccine efficacy for the complete follow up differed by country. Kenya had the highest point estimate of efficacy, followed by Ghana, and then Mali. Overall efficacy against severe rotavirus gastroenteritis was more than 64% in the first year of life, and more than 19% in the second year of life. As for the analysis of primary outcomes, vaccine efficacy in the first year of life was similar between Kenya and Ghana, but was lower in Mali than in the other two countries. Overall, 148 of 189 infants in the vaccine group had IgA seroresponses (a more than three-fold rise from before dose one to after dose three) after completion of the vaccine series. The IgA seroresponse in the pentavalent rotavirus vaccine group was 78.90% in Ghana, 73.80% in Kenya, and 82.50% in Mali. Geometric mean titres after the third dose were similar in the vaccine groups from every country. Geometric mean titres of serum neutralizing antibodies against human rotavirus serotypes in the vaccine were 33.10 for serotype G1, 29.10 for serotype G2, 15.00 for serotype G3, 49.70 for serotype G4, and 44.90 for serotype P[8]. However, seroresponse rates for serum neutralizing antibodies (i.e. a three-fold or higher rise from baseline to after dose 3) were low in this trial, in which infants had high concentrations of serum neutralizing antibodies before the first dose of vaccine or placebo for the rotavirus serotypes contained in the vaccine (Armah et al. 2010). In the study performed on Malawi's infants, Rotarix\u00ae vaccine effectiveness for two doses was 64.00% in test-negative control individuals and 63.00% in community controls. For children with more severe disease, effectiveness for two doses of Rotarix\u00ae vaccine was 68.00% in test-negative control individuals and 68.00% in community controls. The two-dose vaccine effectiveness point estimate was higher for rotavirus G1 (82.00% and 78.00% for test negative and community controls respectively), than for rotavirus G2 (53.00% and 61.00% respectively), or for G12 (53.00% and 61.00% respectively) (Bar-Zeev et al. 2015). Bar-zeev and co-workers (2015) showed robust effectiveness of the G1P[8] Rotarix\u00ae vaccine despite genotypic rotavirus diversity in the population, with fully homotypic (G1P[8]), fully heterotypic (G2P[4], G2P[6], and G12P[6]), and partially heterotypic (G12P[8]) genotypes circulating during their study. The problems which may be associated with the live attenuated vaccines such as the risk of reversion and intussuscptions and other factors such as the high cost of the vaccine may reduce vaccine use (Desai et al. 2012; Madsen et al. 2012). These reasons could also limit their applications for Egyptian infants. Thus non-living recombinant subunit vaccine is therefore considered as an alternative for rotavirus immunization. Recombinant subunit vaccines are made from a fragment of protein expressed in the laboratory using the viral gene. A lot of reports showed the advantages of the recombinant subunit vaccines in relation to the live attenuated vaccines, such as safety profile (due to the lack of replication) and production cost, although they may require the use of adjuvants to elicit a protective and long-lasting immune response (Nascimento and Leite 2012; Perez et al. 2012; El-Senousy et al. 2013d; Chen et al. 2017). The two licensed live attenuated oral rotavirus vaccines do not cover all human rotavirus common P genotypes (such as P[4] and P[6]) circulated in the Egyptian rotavirus cases and in the raw sewage samples in the present study. The currently licensed RotaTeq\u00ae vaccine is based on the most common G genotypes (G1-4)P[5] and G6P[8]) while Rotarix\u00ae is based on G1P[8]. The surveillance of common G and P genotypes in clinical specimens and environmental samples contributes to a better understanding of rotavirus in circulation and helps to characterize the various antigenic shifts that could reduce vaccine efficacy.",

            "text": "It had been well established that rotavirus G-P combinations G1P[8], G2P[4], G3P[8], and G4P[8] are of global epidemiologic importance with G1P[8] being the most important (Santos and Hoshino 2005). Currently available two live oral rotavirus vaccines were selected or designed to provide coverage to such epidemiologically important G and P genotypes since data obtained from experimental animal studies as well as vaccine clinical trials and volunteer studies appeared to suggest that the induction of serotype-specific immunity may be important for optimal protection (Kapikian and Hoshino 2007; Linhares et al. 2008). It was of note that unusual G and P genotypes causing a high incidence of human infection had been reported in various regions of the world including G8, G9, G10, and G12 (Holmes et al. 1999; Steele and Ivanoff 2003; Rahman et al. 2007; Matthijnssens et al. 2008; Sanz et al. 2009; Castello et al. 2009) that are not covered serotypically by Rotarix\u00ae and RotaTeq\u00ae. In our study, high percentage of untypeable samples for common G genotypes may indicate high percentage of uncommon G genotypes. Since in nature, almost all human rotavirus G genotypes had been detected in combination with P[8], P[4], or P[6] (Wen et al. 2012). Based on that Wen and co-workers (2012) suggested that P[8], P[4], and P[6] \u2206VP8* proteins which generated in their study could be used at a minimum singly or preferably in multivalent formulations of two or more components to provide antigenic coverage to almost all the G (VP7) types of global as well as regional epidemiologic importance. In our study, amplification of VP8 fragments of P[8], P[4], and P[6] genotypes which encode amino acid residues 65\u2013223 of Wa VP8, 64\u2013223 of DS-1 VP8, and 64\u2013223 of 1076 VP8 was performed. Wen and co-workers (2012) reported that guinea pigs hyperimmunized with purified Wa P[8] \u2206VP8* elicited high levels of VP8*-homotypic (range 1:7680\u20131:5120) as well as VP8*-heterotypic (1:5120 vs P[4]) neutralizing antibodies. In addition, low levels (1:320 and 1:80) of VP8*-heterotypic neutralizing antibodies were induced against P[6] and P[10] respectively. Similarly, guinea pigs hyperimmunized with purified DS-1 P[4] \u2206VP8* elicited high levels of homotypic (1:5120) and heterotypic (1:1280 vs P[8]), as well as moderate to low levels (1:320 and 1:80 vs P[6] and P[10] respectively) neutralizing antibodies. Guinea pigs hyperimmunized with 1076 P[6] \u2206VP8*, developed high levels of VP8*-homotypic (1:1280) as well as lower heterotypic neutralizing antibodies (1:320 to 1:40 vs P[8] and P[10] respectively). It was of interest that these serological relationships among four different P type strains (i.e. P[4], P[6], P[8], and P[10]) correlated with molecular relationships among them: Wa P[8] strain shares the highest amino acid identity of 82.40% with DS-1 P[4] strain followed by 64.20% with 1076 P[6] strain and 46.80% with 69 M P[10] strain. Mice immunized with DS-1 \u2206VP8* developed high levels of homotypic (i.e. DS-1 P[4] \u2206VP8*) as well as moderate to low levels of heterotypic (i.e. Wa P[8] \u2206VP8*) IgG antibodies. In addition, selected mouse sera showed both homologous (1:80 vs Wa strain) neutralizing activities. These data indicated that these selected \u0394VP8 proteins may be a possible additional candidate as new parenteral rotavirus vaccines. In case of Egyptian clinical specimens, our results showed that 89.20% of the clinical specimens contained at least one of the common P genotypes (P[8], P[4], and P[6]). These P genotypes were combined with typeable common G genotypes (G1 or G3) or untypeable G genotypes. The percentage of untypeable P cases but typeable for G3 was 3.20%, while the percentage of untypeable P cases but typeable for G1 was 5.60%. This may increase the efficiency of the recombinant subunit vaccine which includes the specific proteins of the common P genotypes if it includes also the protein of either G1 or G3 genotypes. These results were supported also by the results of the prevalence of common P genotypes in the raw sewage samples. Common P genotypes were detected in 83.33% of the rotavirus VP6 positive raw sewage samples. Additionally, one raw sewage sample was untypeable for common P genotypes but contained G1 genotype (4.17%). The significantly lower value of the percentage of the common G-typeable clinical specimens in addition to the percentage of P[8] or P[4] or P[6] in the common G-untypeable clinical specimens than the percentage of the common P-typeable clinical specimens in addition to the percentage of G1 or G3 in the common P-untypeable clinical specimens indicated an advantage to the higher prevalence combinations as targets for recombinant subunit vaccine. This was also supported by the results of the raw sewage samples.",

            "text": "As general conclusions, the study showed high burden of rotavirus gastroenteritis as well as higher prevalence of common P genotypes than common G genotypes in Egyptian infants and raw sewage samples. Thus, the prevalence of rotavirus genotypes that are not covered by the currently available live attenuated oral rotavirus vaccines will probably reduce the efficacy of these rotavirus vaccines on Egyptian infants. High prevalence of common P genotypes in any community may put the \u0394VP8-specific proteins as a possible additional candidate as future recombinant subunit rotavirus vaccine especially in some communities which have significantly higher prevalence of common P genotypes than common G genotypes. Addition of the protein of the most prevalent G genotype in the community to the vaccine may increase its efficiency. The most common rotavirus genotypes circulating in the different communities may be taken into consideration in the future vaccine development. The low percentage of the non-silent mutations in the human rotavirus VP8 partial gene may give an additional advantage to the future developed recombinant subunit vaccine.",
