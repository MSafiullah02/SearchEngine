The mRNAs with decay rate \u2a7d0 h\u22121 were excluded from our analyses. In assigning faster expressed genes and slower expressed genes and surveying motifs that regulate mRNA decay, we followed the methods/results of Yang et al. [16]. We use GNF GeneAtlas Version 2 [18] to determine human gene expression level. The data on mRNA half-life and gene expression levels of yeast S. cerevisiae strain Y262 [15] and yeast S. cerevisiae strain rpb1-1 [19] were collected from publication supplements deposited by the authors, http://web.wi.mit.edu/young/pub/holstege.html and http://genome-www.stanford.edu/turnover/data.shtml, respectively. Gutierrez et al. studied the mRNA stability of A. thaliana\n[14]. But they only provided the data of 100 genes with the most unstable transcripts (with half-life \u2a7d 60 min). So, these 100 genes were compared with other genes annotated in A. thaliana genome.",

In human T lymphocytes stimulated with anti-CD3 antibody, there is also a significant difference between mRNA half-lives of intron-containing genes and those of intronless genes (P\n = 0.045). Considered from the average value of mRNA half-lives, the mRNAs of intronless genes are a little more stable than those of the intron-containing genes. But if considered from the median value of mRNA half-lives, the mRNAs of intron-containing genes are more stable than those of the intronless genes. As the nonparametric Mann\u2013Whitney test uses the ranks of the data rather than their raw values to calculate the statistic, the conclusion based on median value is stronger. That is, the mRNAs of intron-containing genes have longer half-lives than those of intronless genes in human T lymphocytes stimulated with anti-CD3 antibody. As a stable mRNA can be measured by lower decay rate or longer half-life, our analyses of different sources of data consistently showed that the mRNAs of intron-containing genes are more stable than those of intronless genes in human cells.",

Meanwhile, previous studies on yeast and human showed a strong relationship between physiological function and mRNA turnover rates [15], [16]. Could the difference in mRNA stability between intronless genes and intron-containing genes be attributed to functional differences? According to the observed mRNA decay rates, Yang and coauthors [16] divided the Gene Ontology (GO) categories into three groups: faster, slower, and no significant. We analyzed the distribution of intron-containing genes and intronless genes in the three GO groups by chi-square test. There are no significant differences in the genes analyzed in bud8 cells and those analyzed in T cells (P\n > 0.10). For the genes analyzed in HepG2 cells, intronless genes appear to be enriched in faster decay group (P\n = 0.046), but the P value is near the conventional significant borderline of 0.05.",

For each human intronless gene, we selected an intron-containing gene with similar function and similar mRNA length to pair with it. The functional similarity was defined as if they share two or more GO terms (http://www.geneontology.org/) and the mRNA length similarity was defined as if the length difference is below 30%. More stringent criteria result in much fewer pairs of genes giving too small a sample to study. In the cases that two or more intron-containing genes are paired with one intronless gene, we used the median value of the mRNA stabilities of the intron-containing genes in the pairwise comparison with the intronless gene. We found that the mRNAs of intronless genes are less stable (i.e. have higher decay rates or shorter half-lives) than the intron-containing genes with similar mRNA lengths and functions (Fig. 1\n). But the differences are not significant in Wilcoxon signed ranks tests of the data from T lymphocytes with anti-CD3 and from T lymphocytes with both anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 (Fig. 1).",

For that reason, we are inclined to think that introns and/or their splicing out from pre-mRNAs have enhancing effects on mRNA stability in yeast S. cerevisiae.",

Nonetheless we can see a trend (although not very distinct) for the mRNAs of intronless genes to be less stable. The enhancing effect seems to be not very strong and so it may be overwhelmed by environmentally or physiologically induced changes.",

The components of mRNPs (messenger ribonucleoprotein particles) recruited during intron splicing or deposited onto exon\u2013exon junctions [25], [26] may be retained in cytoplasmic mRNPs and act as signals of mRNA stability, or simply insulators to avoid inter- or intra-RNA base-pairing. Some proteins have been shown to have such insulating effects to prevent RNA:DNA hybrid (i.e. R loop structure) in nucleus, thereby suppressing unwanted DNA recombination [27], [28], [29], [30]. Similarly, a gene having high intron density is expected to have better insulated mRNAs in cytoplasm. The mRNAs of a human gene without introns or with few introns are more likely to form stem-loop which will stall ribosome and trigger endonucleolytic mRNA cleavage [31], [32]. Meanwhile these mRNAs are also more likely to form double-stranded RNA with other RNAs in cytoplasm, being prone to degraded by RNA interference [33]. In addition, there is also evidence that the exon junction complexes of mRNPs promotes mRNA ribosome association [34]. The ribosomes attached on mRNA may have the effect of stabilizing mRNA in a way similar with the protein components of mRNPs.",
