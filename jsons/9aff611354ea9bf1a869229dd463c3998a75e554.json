The random nature of DNA propagation is discussed using branching process, coalescent process, Markov process, and diffusion process.

We then discuss various features of neutral evolution starting from evolutionary rates, synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions, junk DNA, and pseudogenes.",

Reports of many genome sequencing projects routinely mention neutral evolution in the twenty-first century, e.g., mouse genome paper in 2002 ( [3] ) and chicken genome in 2004 ( [4] ). We thus discuss neutral evolution as one of the basic processes of genome evolution in this chapter. Neutral evolution is characterized by the egalitarian nature of the propagation of selectively neutral mutants. For example, let us consider a bacterial plaque that is clonally formed. All cells in one plaque are homogeneous, or have the identical genome sequences, if there are no mutations during the formation of that plaque. Because of identicalness in genome sequences, there will be no change of genetic structure for this plaque. Let us assume that three cells at time 0 in Fig. 3 .2 are in this clonal plaque. Their descendant cells at time 4 also have the same genome sequences, though the number of offspring cells at that time varies from 0 to 4. This variation is attributed to nongenetic factors, such as heterogeneous distribution of nutrients. However, the most significant and fundamental factor is randomness, as we will see in Sect. 4 ",

If a mutation occurring in some gene modifies gene function, there is a possibility of heterogeneity in terms of number of offsprings. This is the start of natural selection that will be discussed in Chap. 5. However, some mutations may not change gene function, and although they are somewhat different from parental type DNA sequences, mutants and parental or wild types are equal in terms of offspring propagation. We meet the egalitarian characteristic of the selectively neutral mutants. If all members of evolutionary units, such as DNA molecules, cells, individuals, or populations, are all equal, the frequency change of these types is dominated by random events. It is therefore logical that randomness is the most important factor in neutral evolution.",

A cell is the basic building block for all organisms except for viruses. It is thus natural to consider cell as unit of evolution. One cell is equivalent to one individual in single-cell organisms. In multicellular organisms, by definition, one individual is composed of many cells, and a single cell is no longer a unit of evolution. However, if we consider only germ-line cells and ignore somatic cells, we can still discuss cell lineages as the mainstream of multicellular organisms as in the case for single-cell organisms. Alternatively, clonal cells of one single-cell organism can be considered to be one individual. Cellular slime mold cells form a single body with many cells, or each cell may stay independently, depending on environmental conditions [6] .

Asexually reproducing organisms are not necessary to form a population, and multiple individuals observed in proximity, which are often recognized as one population, may be just an outcome of past life history of the organism, and each individual may reproduce independently. Gene exchanges also occur in asexually reproducing organisms, including bacteria. Therefore, by extending species concept, bacterial cells with similar phylogenetic relationship are called species.

            "text": "It should be emphasized that the genealogical relationship of genes is independent from the mutation process when mutations are selectively neutral. A gene genealogy is the direct product of DNA replication and always exists, while mutations may or may not happen within a certain time period in some specific DNA region. Therefore, even if many nucleotide sequences happened to be identical, there must be genealogical relationship for those sequences. However, it is impossible to reconstruct the genealogical relationship without mutational events. In this respect, search of mutational events from genes and their products is also important for reconstructing phylogenetic trees. Advancement of molecular biotechnology made it possible to routinely produce gene genealogies from many nucleotide sequences. Figure 4 .1 shows a schematic gene genealogy for 10 genes. There are two types of genes that have small difference in their nucleotide sequences, depicted by open and full circles. Both types are located in the same location in one particular chromosome of this organism. This location is called \"locus\" (plural form is \"loci\"), after a Latin word meaning place, and one type of nucleotide sequence is called \"allele,\" using a Greek word \u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf meaning different. Open circle allele, called allele A, is ancestral type, and full circle allele, called allele M, emerged by a mutation shown as a star mark. The numbers of gene copies are 8 and 2 for alleles A and M. We thus define allele frequencies of these two alleles as 0.8 (=8/10) and 0.2 (=2/10). Allele frequency is sometimes called gene frequency. It should be noted that these frequencies are exact values if there are only 10 genes in the population in question. If these 10 genes were sampled from that population with many more genes, two values are sample allele frequency.",

There are many alleles in locus A, but let us consider one particular allele A i with n i gene copies. By definition, allele frequency p i for allele A i is n i /2N[t]. When one sperm or egg is formed via miosis, one gene copy is included in that gamete from locus A. If male and female are assumed to be more or less the same allele frequency, the probability to have allele A i in that gamete is p i . This procedure is a Bernoulli trial, and the offspring generation at time t+1 will be formed with 2N where xCy is the possible combinations to choose y out of x. If we continue this binomial distribution for many generations, the random genetic drift will occur. When the number of individuals in that population, or population size, is quite large, this fluctuation is small because of \"law of large numbers\" in probability theory, yet the effect of random genetic drift will never disappear under finite population size.

Because of this history, the mathematical model considered by them is sometimes called \"Galton-Watson process,\" but usually it is called \"branching process\" (see [10] for detailed description of this process). It may be noted that surnames have been studied in human genetics (e.g., [11] ) and in anthropology (e.g., [12] ), for their transmissions often coincide with Y chromosome transmissions. Fisher (1930; [13] ) applied this process to obtain the probability of mutants to be ultimately fixed or become extinct.

The probability Prob[k] of having k offspring during the n times is given by the following binomial distribution: Fisher [13] showed that the mutant is destined to become extinct for m\u22641. When m = 1, one may expect this is a stable situation and the mutant will continue to survive in the population. The population size is assumed to be infinite in the usual branching process, and this causes the mutant gene copy with m = 1 to become extinct. However, we live in finite environment, and the branching process under infinite population size is not appropriate when we consider the long-term evolution. When m>1, the mutant is advantageous, and the probability of survival becomes positive, as we will see in Chap. 5. Readers interested in application of the branching process to fates of mutant genes should refer to Crow and Kimura (1970; [15] ). Although the Poisson process is usually assumed in a random mating population, the real probability distribution of gene copy number may be different. In human study, pedigree data are used to estimate the gene transmission probability. A Kalahari San population (!Kung bushman) was reported to have a bimodal distribution of gene transmission, where the variance is larger than mean (Howell, 1979; [16] ). Interestingly, a Philippine Negrito population was shown to have an approximate Poisson distribution with mean 1.05 (Saitou et al. 1988 ; [17] ). ",

In diploid organism, the number of gene copies for an autosomal locus is 2N, while the number of gene copies for haploid organism locus is N. The former situation is assumed explicitly or implicitly in many literatures. However, the original lifestyle of organisms is haploid, and many organisms today are haploids. Therefore, we consider the situation in haploid organisms first. It should be noted that the constant population size is more or less expected if we consider a long-term evolution. Otherwise, the species will become extinct or will have exponential growth. Though we, Homo sapiens, in fact experience population explosion, this is a rather rare situation among many species. In short-term evolution, population size is expected to fluctuate for any organism. Therefore, assumption of the constant population size is not realistic and is only for mathematical simplicity. We have to be careful about this sort of too simplistic assumptions inherent in many evolutionary theories. There are some more simplifications in the original coalescent theory: discrete generation and random mating. Random mating means that any gene copy is equal in terms of gene transmission to the next generation, and there is no subpopulation structure within the population of N individuals in question.

If we consider a randomly mating population with constant size N, each gene copy at the present population was sampled from N gene copies of the previous generation with replacement. Therefore, if we choose one particular gene copy, say, copy ID 1, from the present population, the probability of its transmission from a specific gene copy of the previous generation is 1/N. Then the probability of gene copy ID 2 from the present population not sharing the same parental copy with copy ID 1 is 1 \u2212 [1/N]. We then go to the next situation in which gene copy ID 3 from the present population shares the parental gene copy with neither ID 1 nor ID 2. Its probability becomes 1 \u2212 [2/N]. Applying a similar argument for IDs 4 to n (n\u2264N), the probability, Prob[n\u2192n, 1], that none of gene copy at the present generation shares the parental gene copy at the previous generation becomes Therefore, the probability corresponding to Eq. 4.14 under the exact coalescent in which n gene copies at the present generation will coalesce to m (<n) ancestral gene copies at t generations ago becomes ",

Unlike the treatment of allele frequency changes to be discussed in later sections, the coalescent generation time is given in terms of the total number of population in the coalescent theory. Because of this, we can check the implicit assumption of the constant population size. For example, the total number of human population as of 2011 A.D. is over 7 billion. If we apply the coalescent theory under the constant 4.2 How to Describe the Random Nature of DNA Propagation population model, the expected number of generations for coalescence of an autosomal gene, 4N, is 27 billion generations. If one generation is 20 years, the expected coalescent time becomes 540 billion years! This value is far greater than the start of this universe, i.e., Big Bang, approximately 14 billion years ago. This seemingly paradoxical situation simply comes from the population explosion, which violates the assumption of constant population size. To overcome this problem, the \"effective population size\" is often used. Modern human is estimated to have ca. 10,000 as the effective population size (e.g., Takahata 1993; [59] ).",

If all genes in later generations will become descendants of this mutant gene, now gene substitution is attained. Evolution of one gene or one locus can be seen as the accumulation of mutations. Therefore, the rate of gene substitution is equated as the rate of evolution. Let us define the mutation rate per gene locus per generation as \u03bc.

Full circles are mutations accumulated in this single lineage, and thin lines represent increase of allele frequency for each mutant. The total number of mutations accumulated during time T is \u03bcT. Therefore, the evolutionary rate, \u03bb, of gene substitutions per generation should be \u03bcT/T = \u03bc. This argument applies to any time irrespective of population size change. Even if speciation occurs, it does not affect this argument based on the single gene lineage. This is why we can consider the long-term evolution. Of course, any gene at the present population can be the starting point for the single lineage genealogy.

However, the majority of mutations surviving for long evolutionary time are selectively neutral. This is a clear difference from the prediction made by researchers who advocated the dominant power of natural selection in 1960s and 1970s. As we will see, the fixation of selectively neutral mutations via stochastic effects is the main power of evolution, and the natural selection to choose advantageous mutations has only a limited contribution, although natural selection to eliminate deleterious mutations is quite effective to keep the current genetic entity. In short, natural selection is mostly conservative, and the chance effects, including the fixation of selectively neutral mutations, are really responsible for creative nature of evolution.",

In this case, molecular clock no longer holds, yet this variation naturally follows the pattern of neutral evolution. Although the molecular clock is often considered as the important characteristics of the neutral evolution, this comes from the simple relationship shown in Eq. 4.38.

In marked contrast to that situation, nine amino acid substitutions accumulated in the mole rat lineage during 40 million years.

We can see a clear enhancement of evolutionary rate for intronless, or processed, pseudogenes for the mouse p53 gene. The estimated numbers of nucleotide substitutions between M. musculus and M. leggada are 0.0157 and 0.0651 for functional genes and pseudogenes, respectively (data from Nonfunctionalization can happen without gene duplication. Vitamins are molecules that exist in small quantity but essential for organisms, especially human, to survive. By definition, vitamins are not produced by the organism itself, and they should be taken in as a part of food. Their very existences are enigmatic, for these molecules are coming from other organisms which produce them. If vitamins are so important, why are they not produced by a certain species such as human? The neutral theory of evolution easily resolves this paradox. If vitamins are abundant in everyday foods, even the mutants with no ability of producing a certain vitamin are selectively neutral compared to wild types with ability to produce that vitamin through the existing enzymatic pathway.",
