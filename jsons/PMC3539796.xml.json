The high dose caused a precipitous drop in body weight during the first week of infection (Fig. 1a, right) but, thereafter, clonal exhaustion and deletion of LCMV-specific T cells resulted in a persistent infection9,10 associated with minimal lung pathology (Fig. 1b, right) and 100% (77 of 77) survival (Fig. 1c, top).

Twenty-three per cent (7 of 31) of control-treated mice succumbed to the medium dose during the second week of infection, and the lungs of surviving mice exhibited bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue, pulmonary oedema and interstitial mononuclear infiltration. Lung pathology was absent in NK-cell-depleted mice, which uniformly survived medium-dose challenge (Fig. 1c, bottom). Moreover, although high levels of replicating virus persisted in surviving control mice at day 15 p.i., NK-cell depletion resulted in complete viral clearance (Fig. 1d, middle). In this case the presence of NK cells was detrimental for the host, as they promoted immune pathology and death.",

Moreover, co-production of TNF and interleukin-2 (IL-2) by antiviral CD4 T cells was augmented by NK-cell depletion (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 3). The increased magnitude of the LCMV-specific T-cell response in the absence of NK cells during medium-dose infection correlated with rapid viral clearance (Fig. 2e). Depletion of NK cells using a carefully titrated dose of anti-asialo GM1 antibody, which eliminates NK cells but not CD8 T cells11, also enhanced antiviral CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses during medium-dose infection (Supplementary Fig. 4).",

In this experiment, mice were harvested on day 12 p.i., when three surviving NK-cell-depleted mice were moribund and required euthanasia, whereas all double-depleted mice showed relatively normal vigour. The livers of NK/CD4 double-depleted mice contained 25-fold more p.f.u. than livers from mice depleted of NK cells alone (NK: 5.7 \u00b1 0.2 p.f.u. versus \u0394NK/\u0394CD4: 7.1 \u00b1 0.1 p.f.u., n = 5, P < 0.0001). Enhancement of LCMV-specific CD8 T cells in the absence of NK cells was also abrogated by concurrent depletion of CD4 T cells (Supplementary Fig. 6). Together these data indicate that CD4 T cells are needed for NK-cell modulation of antiviral CD8 T-cell responses associated with viral clearance, persistence and immunopathology.",

Likewise, recovery of activated (CD44hi CD43(1B11)+) donor CD8 T cells was similar from spleens of control and \u0394NK mice, with minimal loss relative to uninfected control mice (Fig. 4a). In contrast, there was a substantial loss of activated donor CD4 T cells in infected relative to uninfected recipients, and this loss was prevented by depletion of NK cells (Fig. 4a). The magnitude of NK-cell-dependent loss of activated donor CD4 T cells was similar in low-, medium- and high-dose-infected recipients (Fig. 4b). More activated CD4 T cells, both donor and host derived, in infected (control) mice stained positively for the apoptosis indicator annexin V in comparison to naive donor CD4 T cells or to activated donor CD4 T cells in medium-dose-infected \u0394NK recipient mice (Fig. 4c). In contrast to activated donor CD4 T cells, the recoveries of naive (CD44low) phenotype CD4 and CD8 donor T cells were not altered by NK-cell depletion (data not shown).

Of note is that we did not observe the expression of ligands for activating NK-cell receptors including NKG2D, NKp46 (also known as NCR1), DNAM-1 (also known as CD226) and TRAIL (also known as TNFSF10) on these early activated CD4 T cells, and NK-cell-mediated elimination of activated donor CD4 T cells also occurred in antibody-deficient (\u03bcMT\u2212/\u2212) mice (data not shown), precluding a role for antibody-dependent mechanisms. Activated CD4 T cells did, however, express much higher levels of adhesion molecules than naive cells, and these molecules have previously been shown to trigger NK-cell cytotoxicity via LFA-119,20. Somewhat surprising was the observation that the activated CD4 T cells were far more susceptible than activated CD8 T cells to direct killing by the NK cells, even though both expressed high levels of adhesion molecules. We previously had shown that the presence of the negatively signalling receptor CD244 (2B4) on NK cells prevented NK-cell-mediated lysis of activated CD8 T cells21. We found here that although expression of the CD244 ligand CD48 was upregulated on T cells after medium-dose LCMV infection, expression levels of CD48 were much higher on activated CD8 than on activated CD4 cells (mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD48: activated CD4, 3,423 \u00b1 147; activated CD8, 6,180 \u00b1 166; n = 9, P < 0.0001) (Supplementary Fig. 7).",

Their effect on activated CD4 T cells was presumably due to direct cytotoxicity, as demonstrated by rapid perforin-dependent elimination of activated CD4 T cells by NK cells in short-term in vivo cytotoxicity assays and the observation of enhanced annexin reactivity of CD4 T cells in the presence of NK cells. The effect of activated NK cells on CD8 T cells and virus clearance seemed to be indirect, and depended on the presence of CD4 T cells, which are known to produce factors that preserve CD8 T-cell viability and functionality12,13,23,24,25.

Moreover, we found no NK-cell-dependent changes in the number and antigen-presenting function of splenic dendritic cells during LCMV infection (Supplementary Fig. 9), consistent with our finding that NK cells directly regulated the T cells. A possible concern was that in vivo cellular depletion with antibodies against NK1.1 and CD4 have the potential to affect frequencies of NKT, \u03b3\u03b4 T and regulatory T cells, but the frequencies of these lymphocytes in the spleen of LCMV-infected mice were not altered after 3 to 4 days of infection by the low concentration of anti-NK1.1 used in these studies (Supplementary Figs 1 and 10). Moreover, depletion of NK cells in \u03b3\u03b4 T-cell-deficient (Tcrd\u2212/\u2212 ) and NK T-cell-deficient (Cd1d\u2212/\u2212 ) mice during medium-dose infection enhanced LCMV-specific T-cell responses and reduced viral loads (Supplementary Fig. 9), similar to that in wild-type mice.

At the medium-dose inoculum, NK-cell suppression of T cells is detrimental to the host, as virus clearance is impaired due to the limited number and functionality of T cells.

Consistent with the fact that many virus infections induce cytokines that potently activate NK cells28, we found that NK-cell lysis of activated CD4 T cells was triggered by several viruses as well as after inoculation with polyI:C, which induces interferon and activates NK cells. Although a previous study found that NK-cell depletion did not alter the magnitude of antiviral T-cell responses during infection with the Armstrong strain of LCMV29, we have observed enhanced antiviral T-cell responses and improved viral control at early time points after infection of NK-cell-depleted mice with both LCMV Armstrong and Pichinde virus (S.N.W., unpublished observations). Thus, the timing and the type of evaluation may be important to detect detrimental effects of NK cells on T cells during more benign viral infections.",
