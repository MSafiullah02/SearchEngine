Aerosol transmission might happen in a confined space 23 with high concentration of aerosol, according to the 7 th edition of diagnosis and 24 treatment recommendations for COVID-19 released by National Health Commission 25 of China 2 . Although a fecal-oral transmission has yet to be confirmed, in the first 26 reported COVID-19 case in the United States, Michelle et al. detected viral nucleic 27 acid in the stool specimen by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain 28 reaction (rRT-PCR) 3 . This indicated the possibility of transmission of virus 29 discharged from the bowel. However, during hospital isolation of this patient, viral 30 nucleic acid in the stool specimen rapidly turned negative as compared to the 31 respiratory samples, indicating a low possibility of community contamination. 32 From January 24-26, 2020, we received three mild cases of COVID-19 with 33 travel history to Wuhan in Deqing People's Hospital, Zhejiang, China (Supplementary 34 case description). All patients came to the hospital because of fever with or without 35 respiratory symptoms and were isolated for observation and treatment. 36 Nasopharyngeal and anal swabs were collected every 1~3 days for SARS-CoV-2 37 nucleic acids detection. Anal swabs were negative in the early illness periods (Figure 38 1). rRT-PCR was performed using commercial kits (Biogerm, Shanghai, China) 39 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Orf1ab (FAM reporter) and N (VIC reporter) genes of SARS-CoV-2 were detected. Samples were considered to be 41 positive when PCR gave rise to reliable signals (Ct\u226638) for either or both genes. 42 (Supplementary materials and methods). 43 After nucleic acid tests turned negative in the respiratory specimens on illness 44 day 15 in case 1 and illness day 11 in case 2, anal swabs from these two cases without 45 gastrointestinal symptom remained persistently positive by PCR for 5 and 15 days 46 (Figure 1), respectively. 47 Typically, the patients could be released from isolation after the virus tested 48 negative by PCR in the respiratory tract. As described in a retrospective study, in 137 49 survivors from COVID-19, the median duration of viral shedding detected in 50 respiratory specimens was 20 days from illness onset 4 . Nonetheless, patients with 51 respiratory infection may also shed the virus through stool. The presence of 52 SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found in anal swabs or stools in several studies 3, 5-7 , with a 53 positive rate of 39.3% (11 of 28 patients) 6 ; However, RNA detection by PCR does not 54 correlate with the risk of transmission. In a recent Nature paper described, the German 55 researchers failed in virus isolation from stool samples despite high virus RNA 56 concentration among a total of 13 samples from 4 patients with COVID-19 7 . 57 There are three possible sources of the viral RNA in the anal swabs: 1) the 58 sputum that was swallowed; 2) the shed gastrointestinal cells infected with the active 59 virus via an oral route; and 3) the anal cells infected with the active virus via a direct 60 contact. In this study, we could not determine which source applied to these patients 61 and if the detected viral RNA was from the live or dead virus. Until 15 th March, 2020, only one study showed active SARS-CoV-2 virus had been isolated from patients' 63 stool in China (mentioned in a consensus 8 , data not published). Up to date, however, 64 there is no conclusive evidence that SARS-CoV-2 virus can be transmitted through 65 oral-fecal route. Nonetheless, many coronaviruses can be transmitted through the 66 oral-fecal route 5 . In SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infected patients, intestinal infection 67 was observed at later stages of infection 9,10 . Thus, we need more evidence whether 68 viral shedding by PCR is shows that the virus can be transmitted through feces. has been reviewed and approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the 72 Deqing People's Hospital (ref# LL2020-01). The patients had given their consents for 73 publication of clinical details, and written informed consents were obtained. was supported by a funding for COVID-19 from Jiaxing Science and 80 Technology Bureau (2020GZ30001).
