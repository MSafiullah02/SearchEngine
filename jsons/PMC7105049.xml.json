The CoV genome is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA of \u223c30 kb; it contains 14 potential open reading frames (ORFs) and encodes replicase (ORF1a and ORF1ab), structural proteins (spike, nucleocapsid, membrane, and envelope), and accessory proteins (ORF 3a, ORF 3b, ORF6, ORF 7a, ORF 7b, ORF 8a, ORF 8b, and ORF 9b).3 These accessory proteins could be dispensable for virus replication, but might have a specific function in viral infection. ORF3 and ORF 7a proteins activate JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) and NF-\u03baB (nuclear factor kappa B) signaling, upregulate interleukin-8 and RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted), and modulate apoptosis and cell cycle.4, 5 ORF 3b and ORF6 proteins modulate the host innate immune response, including inhibition of Type I IFN production and signaling.4, 5\n",

Thus, SARS-CoV ORF6 protein is an antagonist of Type I IFNs. In this study, we identified cellular ORF6-interacting factors using phage display human lung cDNA library, further examining the association of SARS-CoV ORF6 and host factors in Type I IFN antagonism. The C terminus of nuclear pore complex interacting protein NPIPB3 (nuclear pore complex interacting protein family, member B3; Gene ID: 23117), also known as phosphatidylinositol (PI)-3-kinase-related kinase SMG-1 isoform 1 homolog, displayed on phage surface showed the highest binding affinity to recombinant ORF6 protein. The interaction of ORF6 and NPIPB3 was analyzed using coimmunoprecipitation in vitro and colocalization in cells. The effect of NPIPB3 overexpression on Type I IFN antagonism of ORF6 was determined using dual-luciferase reporter assay system, and STAT1 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation.",

The recombinant ORF6 protein was used for the selection of its interacting cellular factors with phage-displayed human lung cDNA library. After the fifth round of biopanning, ORF6-specific binding phage clones eluted were selected from single phage plaques, amplified in E. coli for determining relative ORF6-binding affinities. Each phage clone was performed by direct binding enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay inORF6-coated wells (Figure 2\n). Phage clone numbers 16, 26, and 40 with higher binding affinity to ORF6 were quantitated using plaque assays (p < 0.01), and we subsequently measured the binding specificity (Figure 3\n). Phage clones numbers. 16, 26, and 40 bound to the recombinant ORF6 protein in a dose-dependent manner. Among the three phage clones, clone number 40 at a titer of 107 phages showed the highest affinity to ORF6 protein (p < 0.001). ORF6-interacting protein-encoding sequences fused in-frame with protein III gene of phage clone numbers 16, 26, and 40 were sequenced. A BLAST alignment search of the nucleotide sequences indicated that ORF6-interacting protein display phage clone numbers 16, 26, and 40 were identified as CCNL1 (cyclin L1), RBMXL2 (RNA binding motif protein, X-linked-like 2), and NPIPB3 (nuclear pore complex interacting protein family, member B3), respectively. Because NPIPB3 displayed on phage clone 40 had the highest binding affinity to ORF6 protein (Figure 3), the interaction between ORF6 and NPIPB3 was further evaluated.",

In the coimmunoprecipitation assay, the ORF6-His tag protein reacted with the Trx-NPIPB3-His tag fusion protein for 4 hours in a cool room, and then the protein complex were coimmunoprecipitated using anti-Trx antibodies and protein A-Sepharose beads. The coimmunoprecipitates were analyzed using Western blotting with the anti-His tag antibodies (Figure 4). The Western blotting analysis of immunoprecipitates revealed that the ORF protein bound to the Trx-NPIPB3-His tag fusion protein, but not to Trx protein (Figure 4, lane 3 vs. lane 1). In the colocalization assay, single and both of DsRed-NPIPB3 and ORF6-His tag proteins were expressed in human promonocyte HL-CZ cells. After immunofluorescence staining with anti-His tag and FITC-conjugated antimouse IgG antibodies, confocal microscopy revealed a very close colocalization of DsRed-NPIPB3 and ORF6-His tag protein appearing as orange to yellow fluorescent light (Figure 5P), but no colocalization between DsRed and ORF6-His tag protein, or DsRed-NPIPB3 and His tag protein (Figures 5D, 5H, and 5L).

Transient overexpression of NPIPB3 C terminus improved with 2.5-fold increase of the ISRE promoter activity in ORF6-expressing cells in response to IFN-\u03b2 (Figure 6; p < 0.001). To examine the subcellular location of STAT1, confocal imaging analysis indicated that the overexpression of NPIPB3 C terminus did not change the subcellular localization of STAT1 in vector control and ORF6-expressing cells [Figure 7A(4)\u2013(6) and 7A(10)\u2013(12)]. The IFN-\u03b2 treatment stimulated STAT1 nuclear translocation in vector control cells [Figures 7B(1)\u2013(3)], but not in ORF6-expressing cells [Figure 7B(7)\u2013(9)]. However, NPIPB3 C terminus overexpression significantly enhanced IFN-\u03b2-induced STAT1 nuclear translocation in ORF6-expressing cells [Figure 7B(10)\u2013(12)]. In addition, Western blotting indicated NPIPB3 C terminus overexpression enhancing IFN-\u03b2-induced STAT1 phosphorylation at Tyr701 inORF6-expressing cells (Figure 8). Results demonstrated that NPIPB3 C terminus overexpression reduced Type I IFN antagonism of SARS-CoV ORF6 via activating STAT1-mediated signal pathways.",

            "text": "Biopanning of phage-displayed human lung cDNA libraries identified the binding interaction of ORF6 with its interacting host factors, including CCNL1, RBMXL2, and NPIPB3 (Figure 2, Figure 3). CCNL1 displayed on phage clone number 16, containing an arginine- and serine-rich domain and a cyclin domain was required for spliceosome assembly and regulated splicing.17, 18 RBMXL2 displayed on phage clone number 26 was one of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins, suggested as a germ cell-specific splicing regulator.19 ORF6-interacting phage clone number 40 displayed the C-terminal domain of NPIPB3 (Figure 2, Figure 3). NPIPB3 had many alternative names such as nuclear pore complex-interacting protein-like 3, protein pps22-1, KIAA0220-like protein, nuclear pore complex-interacting protein B type, and PI-3-kinase-related kinase SMG-1 isoform 1 homolog.20 NPIPB3 containing a transmembrane region at the N terminus was recognized as a membrane protein and served as an RNA splicing factor. NPIPB3 was upregulated in epithelial Caco-2 cells after exposure to probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus L-92, linking with immune response, DNA binding, and protein synthesis.21 NPIPB3 was also identified to bind IFN-\u03b1 promoter.22 In this study, overexpression of NPIPB3 C-terminal domain reduced the antagonistic activity of Type I IFN by SARS-CoV ORF6 protein (Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8). The diacidic cluster motif (residues 53\u201356) was found in the ORF6 protein, as the critical determinant of subcellular localization to vesicular structures.23 Interestingly, the C-terminal domain of NPIPB3 had several four positively charged residue (KRRR) repeats. Therefore, ionic interactions could be linked with the binding interaction between SARS-CoV ORF6 and NPIPB3 C-terminal domain. In addition, the interaction between SARS-CoV ORF6 and NPIPB3 C-terminal domain might influence the binding interaction between ORF6 and karyopherin alpha 2; thus, the C-terminal domain of NPIPB3 recovered the nuclear import carrier function of karyopherin alpha 2 in ORF6-expressing cells, correlating with STAT1 nuclear translocation after IFN-\u03b2 treatment (Figure 7). In addition, overexpression of the NPIPB3 C-terminal domain reduced IFN-\u03b2-induced phosphorylation of STAT1 at Tyr701 (Figure 8, lane 2). Tyrosine-protein kinase JAK1 (Janus kinase 1) contained a putative phosphoinositide binding site; an interaction between JAK1 and PI-3-kinase was reported in interleukin-2 signaling pathway.24 Meanwhile, NPIPB3, also known as PI-3-kinase-related kinase SMG-1, showed functional and structural similarities to PI-3-kinase.25 Therefore, NPIPB3 overexpression might increase the interaction with JAK1, which influenced IFN-\u03b2-induced JAK/STAT signaling, resulting in the decrease of STAT1 phosphorylation at Tyr701.",

By contrast, the interaction of SARS-CoV ORF6 with the C-terminal domain of NPIPB3 in human promonocytes reduced the Type I IFN antagonism of ORF6.",
