Moreover, most human infectious diseases are derived from animals, and zoonotic infections always spread on directed interconnected networks. So, in this article, we consider the epidemic dynamics of zoonotic infections on a unidirectional circular-coupled network. Here, we construct two unidirectional three-layer circular interactive networks, one model has direct contact between interactive networks, the other model describes diseases transmitted through vectors between interactive networks, which are established by introducing the heterogeneous mean-field approach method. Then we obtain the basic reproduction numbers and stability of equilibria of the two models. Through mathematical analysis and numerical simulations, it is found that basic reproduction numbers of the models depend on the infection rates, infection periods, average degrees, and degree ratios. Numerical simulations illustrate and expand these theoretical results very well. theory [5, 6], complex networks have become a powerful tool in studying epidemiology models [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Especially, a population can be viewed as a complex network, in the sense that a node denotes an individual and a link (edge) denotes the correlation between two individuals, then the disease can spread along edges of the network. In an epidemiology model, because the complexity of different contact types between individuals, it is unreasonable to simplify the complex network to a homogeneous network [12] . And, in order to study the effect of network structures on epidemic spread, many heterogeneous epidemic models have been established [13] [14] [15] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1275, "end": 1278, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1279, "end": 1282, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1283, "end": 1286, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1287, "end": 1291, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1292, "end": 1296, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1703, "end": 1707, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1843, "end": 1847, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1848, "end": 1852, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1853, "end": 1857, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Many previous studies focus on a single network, however, real networks are usually large and complex, such as social networks, neural networks, information networks and transportation networks [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] , and many diseases spread among different populations with various contact patterns.

When the infection rate \u03bb 2 is fixed, the infected density \u03c1 increases with the growth of \u03bb 1 . If the infection rates \u03bb 2 and \u03bb 3 are very strong, however, the stable infected density of subnetwork A is very small. Thus, \u03bb 2 and \u03bb 3 generate less incidence on the disease transmission than \u03bb 1 .

The first epidemic model contains three different populations, and the direction of disease transmission is one-way, forming a circular-coupled network. Three different infective media are embedded in the second model. By Perron-Frobenius theorem, we estimate the basic reproduction number R 0 of the two models, then present global stability analysis of the disease-free and endemic equilibria of the first model. For the second model, the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable if R 0 < 1, while the unique endemic equilibrium is globally attractive if R 0 > 1.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions and Discussions"}, {"text": "By numerical simulations, we found that both the inner and cross interactions can contribute to the epidemic spread, however, for the first model, the inner contact patterns have a bigger impact on R 0 than the cross contact patterns. Under the same contact pattern, the internal infection rates have greater influence on R 0 than the cross infection rates. Moreover, three subnetworks have almost the same impact on R 0 , and the different cross contact patterns hardly have any remarkable impact on R 0 . As a general situation, we set two human subnet-works and one animal subnetwork in the second model. Due to the particularity of transmission mode, with the increases of infection rate \u03bb 1 , subnetwork A has the bigger impact on vector a, the smaller effect on subnetwork B, and almost no influence on subnetwork C, vectors b and c, the others are similar. One can see that if the disease spreads in a subnetwork with a small infection rate, then the infection from the infected vector has almost no influence on the subnetwork. Based on these studies, we can find ways to effectively control the spread of diseases in interdependent networks. Hence, this work presents two special unidirectional circular-coupled epidemic models for better understanding the epidemic dynamics on interconnected networks in real life. Moreover, we hope our results may make a contribution to the practical applications to the control of zoonotic infectious diseases.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions and
