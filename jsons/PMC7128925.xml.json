Active diagnosis of respiratory pathogens has been proposed as one potential solution to this problem. However, in our randomized controlled trial, the knowledge of the results of multiplex respiratory virus testing did not reduce antimicrobial consumption in adults in acute care. Sixty-four per cent of the participants in both the intervention and control group received antibiotics during the 30-day follow-up period and there were no differences in the antibiotic days, defined daily doses or duration of hospital care between the groups.",

In one randomized controlled trial in the UK, adult patients presenting at hospital with acute respiratory illness or fever were randomized into two groups, for either a molecular point-of-care test for respiratory viruses or routine care. Over 80% of the patients in both groups received antibiotics and the mean duration of antibiotics remained unchanged [14]. Also, when viral detection was combined with serum procalcitonin (PCT) measurement and an algorithm for interpreting the PCT results was provided there was no significant difference in antibiotic use [15]. However, a subgroup analysis in this randomized controlled trial conducted with individuals with non-pneumonic lower respiratory tract infections in a US community hospital showed shorter duration of antibiotic treatment in the algorithm-adherent patients, and fewer patients with positive viral testing and low PCT values were discharged with antibiotics. A large randomized trial of 1656 patients with suspected lower respiratory tract infection, covering 14 US urban academic hospitals obtained the same result. There was no difference in days on antibiotics or in adverse events between the standard care group and the intervention group, which had an additional viral testing and PCT measurement provided with graded recommendations for antibiotic use based on PCT levels [16]. In a Canadian quasi-experimental before-and-after study combining virology testing with an antimicrobial stewardship intervention, a 1.3-day decrease in mean days on antibiotics was noted compared with the previous year [17]. Without counselling, physicians seem to respond less to positive viral results other than influenza and rely more on radiographic findings when deciding on antibiotic treatment, as shown in a prospective observational study conducted in a Canadian tertiary hospital [18].",

In an observational study of Medicare patients aged \u226565 years, mortality among hospitalized individuals with community-acquired pneumonia was 11% [21]. The incidence of pneumonia rose five-fold and mortality was doubled as age increased from 65\u201369 years to >90 years [21]. A secondary analysis of the EPIC study, in which in-hospital deaths of pneumonia patients were evaluated, noted that only 2.2% of the patients died in tertiary hospitals but 63.4% of these were at least 65 years old and 61.5% had at least two co-morbidities [22].

Influenza-like symptoms have been associated with more positive virus detections in other studies as well [23].
