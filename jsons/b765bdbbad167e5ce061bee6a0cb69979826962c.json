Technological advances in connectivity and digitisation are enabling vertically and horizontally integrated networks. The highly technical and dynamic environment in which various types of relationships exist requires a high level of cooperation and transparency between partners. The importance for Small and Medium Sized Organisations (SMEs) to develop and improve their relational capabilities is widely acknowledged. This research paper thus presents a tool and methodology that will enable SMEs to assess and improve these capabilities within the organisation. This paper aims to identify those requirements and practices described in the literature as conducive to sustainable relationship formation and development. A Relational Capability Maturity Model (RCMM) is proposed as a tool that will be able to address the requirements across the various functions of the organisation.",

The flexible structures and agile operations of SMEs are especially suitable for the early stages of the innovation process where ideas are created and conceptualised [5, 6] . SMEs have a relative advantage in learning and knowledge creation in emerging and risky areas [7] . Large firms on the other hand, have existing structures that are suitable for testing, documentation and operation processes that are found at the later stages of innovation [5] . The deep specialisation of SMEs can complement the service offering of large firms where they do not have the internal expertise. Large firms can in turn, expose SMEs to the critical resources and capabilities required to realise innovating ideas [2, 7] .",

New and specialised capabilities are often considered a prerequisite to enable growth to new areas. While large firms usually focus on the products and services with major potential, they are able to access new capabilities from specialist firms, with less capital investment required on their own part [2, 5] . For SMEs, this means that they are able to move into the markets of the large firm without acquiring additional capabilities [8] . The advantage of partnerships with firms who have chosen to specialise in those activities, is that these firms are likely to perform the activities better. As a result, every activity is being performed by a tightly focused firm [2]. Their first-mover advantage will be enhanced, enabling them to increase their market share [8] .",

While these adaptations imply considerable, often non-transferable, investments by one or both parties, it simultaneously provides learning opportunities. The knowledge that SMEs acquire throughout the unique projects can be transferred to other partnerships or developed to products. In this regard, partnerships are seen as a key resource access to valuable organisational, technical and market knowledge held by key customers. This knowledge can then be used to improve and upgrade products and services, production facilities and organisational units and mechanisms [11] .",

The research in this paper therefore followed the constructivist philosophical perspective, and was conducted primarily through an exploratory approach. Jabareen's (2009) conceptual framework analysis (CFA) method formed the foundation upon which the RCF was developed, with specific procedures modified according to the nature and requirements for this study. The CFA method is commonly used to build conceptual frameworks from multiple bodies of knowledge that belong to different disciplines [18] . Due to the ability of the CFA method to clarify conceptual linkages between different domains it was deemed an appropriated method to guide the development of the RCF. The six phases of the CFA method is summarised in Table 1 . Phase 1 was completed through a systematised literature review to provide an exhaustive review of the literature that is currently available [19] . The advantages of this method are mainly seen in its rigour and transparent process [20] . Data was collected from Scopus. The search was completed by using a combination of the keywords \"business ecosystem\" and \"SME\". The search delivered a total of 38 documents, which was then filtered through a series of criteria. After the initial screening process the final 22 documents were critically analysed (See Table 2 ).",

The organisational means, referred to as relational capabilities, thus identify certain internal capabilities that SMEs would require to satisfy the relationship requirements. In total, 37 relational capabilities were identified, these are also included in Table 3 . In B2B relationships, partners work together towards reaching a common goal [21] [22] [23] [24] . The level of goal congruency refers to the possibility for both firms to achieve their goals simultaneously [25] . According to Cuevas, Julkunen and Gabrielsson (2015), goal congruency can be viewed as a prerequisite for developing relationships of trust. If partnerships are goal congruent, the firms will view joint action as mutually beneficial [26] (a) Establish shared relationship vision and goals; While there are various ways to measure process capabilities, the topic of capability improvement often refocuses on the content and guidelines of maturity modelling. Maturity models are well-known and widely used tools that enable users to assess the current state of maturity of capabilities in a certain domain. Maturity models further enables users to identify the strengths and weaknesses of those capabilities, and suggests an improvement plan to increase overall performance. The concept of maturity can be traced back to quality management when Crosby (1979) introduced the idea of maturity stages building on each other [32] . One of the most recognised and most widely used maturity models today is the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI\u00ae). The CMMI has its roots in the original Capability Maturity Model\u00ae for software (SW-CMM\u00ae), which was developed in 1986 in response to a request from the federal government for a method to assess the capability of their software contractors. The Software Engineering Institute (SEI) developed a process maturity framework that would help organisations improve their software processes [33, 34] . The SEI defined the CMMI as \"a reference or process model of mature practices in a specified discipline, used to improve and appraise a group's capability to perform that discipline\" [35] .",

Furthermore, complex interrelations exist between the relational capabilities. For this reason, it was decided to construct the framework along two dimensions, the organisational construct and the relational construct. The structure is largely based on the structure of the Innovation Capability Maturity Model (ICMM) as developed by [36] . The ICMM guides its users to address the maturity of innovation capability, while considering the multiple dimensions of innovation, and the different parts of the organisation that is affected. The model is also designed with the applicability and practicality factor in mind. Relational capabilities share various fundamental aspects with innovation capabilities in the sense that it is multi-dimensional, dynamic and complex. The ICMM is consequently considered to be a suitable reference to structure relational capabilities. The structure that forms the Relational Capability Framework (RCF) is displayed in Fig. 1 .",
