            "text": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is one among the very serious infections that threatens the people worldwide, less than 300 million people live with chronic hepatitis B infection worldwide. It directly or indirectly affects the liver, causing diseases affecting also infants and young children. This virus is genetically from the family of Hepadnaviridae having very rare qualities resembling retroviruses [1]. Hepatitis B is a viral infection that attacks the liver and can cause both acute and chronic diseases. The infection is a potentially life-threatening liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). In 2015, hepatitis B resulted in an estimated 887,000 deaths, mostly from cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. As of 2016, 27 million people (10.5% of all people estimated to be living with hepatitis B) were aware of their infection, while 4.5 million (16.7%) of the people diagnosed were on treatment. Hepatitis B can be prevented by vaccines that are safe, available, and effective. The modalities of transmission of the HVB are completely different from those of the HAV (hepatitis A virus) but can be compared to those of the HCV and HIV virus. HCV is most commonly transmitted through contact with blood or other body fluids as well as from a positive mother to a child during birth and delivery. This poses a major public health problem for the protection of those living with affected patients, healthcare professionals and requires serious and effective control of blood transfusions. Transmission of the virus may also occur through the reuse of needles and syringes either in healthcare settings or among persons who inject drugs [2\u20134]. In addition, infection can occur during medical, surgical, and dental procedures, through tattooing, or through the use of razors and similar objects that are contaminated with infected blood. HBV infection can be either acute or chronic. The illness can be asymptomatic, symptomatic and may progress to cirrhosis. There is no specific treatment for acute hepatitis B. Chronic HBV infection is defined as persistence of hepatitis B surface antigen for six months and more after acute infection with HBV. It is a major public health problem because the majority of people are unaware of their HBV infection; they are asymptomatic and can transmit the disease. Chronic hepatitis B infection can be treated with medicines, including oral antiviral agents. Only a proportion (estimates vary from 10% to 40% depending on the setting and eligibility criteria) of people with chronic hepatitis B infection will require treatment. So, to prevent this disease and infection, hepatitis B vaccine should be taken. The vaccine is effective to prevent the infection increasing the protective levels of antibodies [5, 6]. Mathematical model is an essential tool to understand the virus dynamics, and it intensifies our understanding of the virus. The first important mathematical models covering immune response were developed by Anderson and May on infectious diseases of humans, in particular HIV and other viral diseases [7]. Other authors proposed different mathematical models concerning the transmission of viral infection. Blessing proposed a mathematical model of hepatitis B virus transmission dynamics with considerations of different classes of individuals, namely immunized, susceptible, latent, infected, and recovered classes [8]. Kamyad et al. suggested a mathematical model considering the immune response of vaccinated infants, what treatments given to an infected person, and how it controls the transmission of HBV [9]. The humoral immune response is also important in HCV infection and is the key to vaccine development [10]. Su, B. et al. [11] proposed an HBV transmission model utilized to know the vaccination effectiveness and transmission control.",

            "text": "Application of the mathematical models to different parameters shows that some patients get cleared of the virus quickly due to drug therapy, whereas in case of other patients the drug therapy works much slower [12]. Therefore, in some cases treatment has to be stopped. Then, the viral degeneration is observed in most patients [13]. In this paper, we try to get a deeper understanding of the complex virus dynamics that is seen during drug therapy in HBV infections. Such knowledge helps to improve the treatment by informing what drugs to use, when to start, and when to stop [14\u201317]. The main motivation of the paper is that this will help the young researchers of medicine as well as science find a solution comparing to real world problems pertaining to HBV antiviral therapy. Finding the analytical solutions for this model is very challenging. But we found the analytical solution for Eq. (2.1) using the LHAM method. Our model is very useful and it is easy to find the analytical solutions. We also can find the numerical simulations by using MATLAB for the same equations.",

It also considers that the infected cells die at a rate of \u03b4 and production of new virus happens at a rate of v. The rate of dead virus is c.

The potentiality of HAM depicts the convergence of sequence solution for nonlinear differential equations, which we proved in this paper confirming that HAM is a very effective and powerful technique to find the approximate semi-analytical solutions. The numerical simulations have been obtained up to sixth-order approximations, and error analysis has been done with the help of Mathematica software. The study of mathematical models of disease development will allow better knowledge of disease evolution to reduce the incidence of accidental infections among healthcare professionals and to improve the quality of life of patients who may be given therapies already experienced in other hepatitis [29]. This research paper can be a framework for the young researchers to do a further research and design an effective antiviral therapy and drug design.",
