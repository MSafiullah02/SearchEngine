Unassisted use of a smartphone-based refractor application (Netra, EyeNetra Inc., Somerville, MA, USA) in adults (aged 18-35 years, refractive range -9.25 to +0.50D) showed a significantly more median myopic overcorrection of 0.60D when compared to conventional subjective refraction. Median visual acuity estimates were also significantly lower with the app [29]. The findings echoed previous work where the same app showed absolute differences in spherical error of more than 0.50D for approximately 60% of eyes when compared to subjective refraction, and estimates of VA were also poorer (participant age range 20-90 years, refractive range \u221215.25 to 4.25D) [32].",

Similarly, a comparison between conventional corneal examination versus digital images (obtained using the Apple iTouch 5 G, [Apple, Cupertino, CA] and Nidek VersaCam [Nidek, Fremont, CA] cameras), showed sensitivity with photographs was, in general, high for pathologies such as pterygium (sensitivity >90%), but not corneal scarring (sensitivity <58%) [56]. Of particular relevance to contact lens work is a report which showed grading of corneal staining was underestimated when using digital images compared to live grading using a slit lamp [59]. Thus, the overarching indication is that subtle anterior eye changes are generally less discernible using photographs compared to direct observation. Improvements in sensitivity, though not necessarily specificity, to detection of anterior segment pathology using photographs may be achieved by considering the photos in combination with patient history and visual acuity information [57].",

The feasibility of lens fitting apps is likely to be limited by difficulties in visualising lenses, particularly soft lenses, against the non-uniform background of the ocular surface, without the magnification and illumination benefits provided by a slit lamp. The potential for future lens fitting assessment apps may be inferred from studies investigating video evaluation of lens fits.",
