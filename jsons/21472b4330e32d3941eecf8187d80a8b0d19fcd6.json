We aim to decipher SARS-CoV-2 infected cell types, the consequent host immune response and their interplay in the lung of COVID-19 patients. Design: We analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of lung samples from 17 subjects (6 severe COVID-19 patients, 3 mild patients who recovered and 8 healthy controls). The expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors (ACE2 and TMPRSS2) was examined among different cell types in the lung. The immune cells infiltration patterns, their gene expression profiles, and the interplay of immune cells and SARS-CoV-2 target cells were further investigated. Results: Compared to healthy controls, the overall ACE2 (receptor of SARS-CoV-2) expression was significantly higher in lung epithelial cells of COVID-19 patients, in particular in ciliated cell, club cell and basal cell. Comparative transcriptome analysis of these lung epithelial cells of COVID-19 patients and healthy controls identified that SARS-CoV-2 infection activated pro-inflammatory signaling including interferon pathway and cytokine signaling. Moreover, we identified dysregulation of immune response in patients with COVID-19. In severe COVID-19 patients, significantly higher neutrophil, but lower T and NK cells in lung were observed along with markedly increased cytokines (CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL7, CCL3L1 and CCL4L2) compared with healthy controls as well as mild patients who recovered. The cytotoxic phenotypes were shown in lung T and NK cells of severe patients as evidenced by enhanced IFN\u03b3, Granulysin, Granzyme B and Perforin expression. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infection altered the community interplay of lung epithelial cells and immune cells: the interaction between epithelial cells with macrophage, T and NK cell was stronger, but their interaction with neutrophils was lost in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls. : medRxiv preprint Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 infection activates pro-inflammatory signaling in lung epithelial cells expressing ACE2 and causes dysregulation of immune response to release more pro-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infection breaks the interplay of lung epithelial cells and immune cells.",

SARS-CoV-2 belongs to coronaviruses family which are singlestranded and positive-sense RNA viruses characterized by club-like spike on their surface 3 . SARS-CoV-2 binds to the surface expressed proteins, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), to entry into cells which is similar as SARS-CoV 4-6 . In addition to ACE2, the expression of serine protease TMPRSS2 on target cells is required for activation of viral spike (S) proteins to facilitate viral entry 6 .

This study provides the novel information on the cell types of lung epithelia cells expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2, and their expression levels in COVID-19 patients based on single cell sequencing analyses.

These secreted signaling molecules serve to initiate host immune response by recruiting various immune cells 21 . In severe COVID-19 patients, the accumulated immune cells (neutrophils, macrophage and T/NK cells), especially massive infiltration of neutrophils, expressed significantly higher levels of cytokines including CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL7, CCL3L1 and CCL4L2, which might contribute to lung damage. Although T cells and NK cells were reduced in the lung of severe COVID-19 patients, cytotoxic phenotypes of these cells were recognized due to significant induction of IFNG, GNLY, GZMB and PRF1. Activation of these genes were found in cytotoxic T cells (CD8+) and NK cells that inhibit virus propagation and triggers apoptosis of infected cells 22,23 . Accordingly, a higher ratio of severe COVID-19 patients was reported to present T cells specific to the viral antigen with production of INF\u03b3 or GZMB in peripheral blood compared to mild COVID-19 cases 10,24 . All these findings implied that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces the aberrant epithelial cell gene expression, enriched pro-inflammation signalings and the dysregulated host immune response in lung. By investigating the correlation between gene expression profiles of lung epithelia cells and host immune response, we discovered that the correlations between host cellular response and immune cell frequencies were altered after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The interplay between lung epithelia cells and neutrophils infiltration were diminished; in contrast, their interactions with macrophage and T/NK cell were stronger. Of these genes that were involved in the network, ASS1, CXCL8 and HLA-B expression were promoted directly by SARS-CoV-2. ASS1 ablation was reported to ameliorate liver injury by reducing neutrophil infiltration 25 . Meanwhile, CXCL8 could recruit neutrophils to the site of damage or infection. , implying possible imbalanced control of innate immune response. HLA-B plays a critical role in the immune system through displaying foreign peptides. The interaction between HLA-B and T/NK cells were enhanced in the lung of COVID-19 patients, suggesting the potential activation of these immune cells by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Collectively, these data suggested that SARS-CoV-2 infection alters the interplay of lung epithelial cells and immune cells. In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 infection induces aberrant gene expression profiling and activation of pro-inflammatory signaling of lung epithelium cells (ciliated, club and basal cells) that expressing high levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infection causes dysregulated lung immune response and massive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and disrupts the interplay of epithelial cells and immune cells. All these contribute to the consequent extensive lung damage",

The ranking of PCs based on the variance explained by each PC were draw by ElbowPlot in Seurat and the majority of true signal is captured in the first 20 PCs (Figure S1). To visualize the cells, we applied the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) on the top 20 PCs. The selected PCs were also used for computing nearestneighbour graphs and for clustering the cells. To re-annotate the cells, we identified the conserved markers for each cluster across different conditions, by comparing with all remaining clusters using FindConservedMarkers method in Seurat pipeline. Then, a manual curated cell type marker list was applied to annotate the cell type for each cluster.
