As happened with the Spanish Pandemic of 1918, the emergence of previously unknown viruses such as SARS has catalyzed important progress in clinical virology: 1) Development and stringent application of case de\u00a2nitions and infection control measures to limit transmission and eventually contain the spread in disease; 2) International communication and collaboration for the speedy identi\u00a2cation and characterization of the implicated infectious agent; 3) Introduction of rapid nucleic acid testing (NAT) of high sensitivity and speci\u00a2city with a turn-around time of o 24 h for clinical management; and 4) Freely accessible information \u00a3ow through speci\u00a2c websites on all of these issues.",

As early as in the \u00a2rst week of May 2009, we provided a 7days-a-week service for the University Hospital Basel and the northwestern region of Switzerland, by establishing polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based diagnostic NAT targeting speci\u00a2cally only the hemagglutinin gene of the new in\u00a3uenza A/H1N1 by adapting the oligonucleotide sequences described by Richt The median viral load of the positive samples was 2.5 \u00c2 10 5 copies/mL, but the interquartile range was broad, reaching from 1.07 \u00c2 10 5 to 5.97 \u00c2 10 6 copies/mL. All of the 7 con\u00a2rmed cases had recently traveled from the USA. All 7 were treated with oseltamivir 75 mg twice a day and recovered without signi\u00a2cant complications. As we had a multiplex NAT in place that could identify 19 respiratory pathogens (3), we wondered what else was present in the remaining 79 individuals. As shown in F|gure 1, respiratory viruses were detected in 56 (65%) of the patients, with the leading pathogen being rhinoviruses (RhV) in 31 (36%), followed by adenovirus (ADV) in 5 (6%), human metapneumovirus (hMPV) in 4 (5%), in\u00a3uenzavirus B (FLU-B) in 3 (3%), coronaviruses (CoV, 2%), and parain\u00a3uenza (PIV, 2%) in 2 cases each, as well as 1 dual infection with PIV-1 and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-B was detected in 1 sample (1%). No pathogen was detected in 35% of our patients, suggesting a role for still other pathogens or possibly non-infectious causes including sampling errors. However, sampling errors are not very likely because the strategy was well de\u00a2ned (1 nasal swab plus 1 throat swab both into viral transport medium) and performed under dedicated isolation precautions.",

While this vulnerability naturally applies to small children, transplant patients are similarly at risk for higher and longer virus replication, increased virus-mediated cytopathology, and progression to more extensive in\u00a3ammation and organ dysfunction. Although the intensity of immunosuppression is a key determinant, the allogenic constellation between the virus-infected cells and the cellular immune e\u00a1ectors contributes to an impaired antiviral immune control. Accordingly, morbidity and mortality of respiratory virus infections is accentuated after lung or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (6) . Moreover, longer term consequences of decreased pulmonary function, bronchiolitis obliterans, and related syndromes become more likely.",

The retrospective multicenter study by Liu et al. (8) analyzed risk factors and outcome of respiratory viral infections in 576 pediatric patients within the \u00a2rst year after lung transplantation. In this high-risk population (i.e., being pediatric, immunosuppressed, and lung-transplanted), 101 respiratory virus infections were reported in 79 patients (14%). By mostly non-molecular methods, a wide variety of viruses was detected in the patients showing respiratory symptoms, the most common being ADV (25%), RhV (22%), RSV (21%), and PIV (19%). Importantly, detection of respiratory virus infections was more frequent in younger children and was independently associated with a decreased 1-year survival (8) . As stated by the authors, the usage of modern NAT, which was not readily available in the study period from 1998 to 2005, might have increased the diagnostic yield. NAT, especially real-time PCR assays, nowadays plays a central role in virus diagnostics and is increasingly considered as the 'gold standard' for the detection of viruses.",

(9) in this issue of Transplant Infectious Disease illustrates this shift to molecular diagnostics as the reference method for respiratory infections in hematopoietic cell transplant recipients. By using PCR assays targeting RSV, FLU-A and -B, PIV-1 and -3, and hMPV, the authors have obtained 2 times more positive samples than by culture alone, and 4 times more than by direct \u00a3uorescent antibody staining. A positive result by conventional diagnostic assays required signi\u00a2cantly higher genome viral loads above 5.75 log genome equivalents (gEq)/mL in real-time reverse-transcription PCR assays. Although only 34 samples with 6 di\u00a1erent viruses were tested (19 PIV, 6 RSV, and 3 FLU), the overall \u00a2ndings of Kuypers et al. (9) support the results of 2 previous studies demonstrating the superior sensitivity of PCR compared with classical methods for 34 RSV and 21 in\u00a3uenza cases after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (10, 11) . For the in\u00a3uenza cases, the threshold for positive culture results was 45.1 log gEq/mL (11) , and for RSV it was 45.3 log gEq/mL (10) .
