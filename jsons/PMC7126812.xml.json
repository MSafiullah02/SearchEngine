One approach to explaining this is to study special circumstances in which the frequency of frameshift errors can be increased by up to 50%. Frame-maintenance can be reduced either by mutations in rRNA or by changes to various other components of the translational apparatus, such as EF-Tu, tRNAs and mRNA sequences. Understanding how the incidence of frameshift can be increased might provide insights into how it is prevented normally.",

            "text": "The extremely low frequency of frameshift errors indicates that errors in the size of the repeating three-nucleotide step are rare. However, how this step size is maintained remains controversial. In one model it is suggested that the size of tRNA anticodons defines the step size by defining both codon length and translocation distance. This view is derived from studies of mutant tRNAs in which expansion of the anticodon to four nucleotides causes a +1 frameshift. In the first characterized example of this, the suppressor sufD42 alters a tRNAGly by expanding its anticodon from CCC to CCCC. This allows tRNAGly to suppress frameshift mutations in structural genes that result from the expansion of GGN Gly codons to GGGN (where N is any nucleotide) [18]. The structures indicate a simple, elegant model, termed the quadruplet translocation model [19]. This proposes that by expanding the anticodon to four nucleotides, the tRNA could base-pair to a four-nucleotide codon in the mRNA and that, during translocation, the tRNA would move four nucleotides into the P site, thus displaying a +1 shifted codon in the A site [19]. It is important to remember that this model is hypothetical and that, for example, there is no solved structure of a frameshift-suppressor tRNA paired with an mRNA.",

            "text": "The quadruplet translocation model assumes that the ribosome has no direct role in defining step size. However, the recent structure of an aa-tRNA\u2013mRNA\u201330S ribosome complex seems to contradict this assumption [9]. The decoding site explicitly contacts each of the three base-pairs that form in the A- and P sites 9, 10, which indicates that the structure of the ribosome implicitly defines the codon. In fact, the ribosome appears to constrain the mRNA so that only three nucleotides of the tRNA can interact with the A-site codon (Fig. 2). A 45\u00b0 kink in the mRNA on the 5\u2032 side of the A-site codon defines the first nucleotide in the A site. At the other end of the interaction, the ribosome places nucleotide C1054 immediately below the wobble nucleotide of the tRNA. The distance between the kink and C1054 is sufficient to allow codon\u2013anticodon interaction between three pairs of bases, but not four. The model was further called into question by results showing that the nucleotide at the 3\u2032 end of the putative four-nucleotide anticodon is modified to 1-methylguanosine in a major class of frameshift suppressor tRNAs, tRNAPro suppressors, in Salmonella typhimurium\n[20]. Because methylation blocks base pairing to cytosine, these tRNAs are incapable of a four base-pair interaction with mRNA. Importantly, in the quadruplet translocation model, the modified nucleotide would recognize the first nucleotide in the expanded anticodon. By blocking base pairing, this modification should render the tRNA incapable of distinguishing suppressible sites (e.g. CCCC) from nonsuppressible ones (ACCC, GCCC or UCCC). The fact that the tRNA can distinguish these sites demonstrates that the quadruplet translocation model is invalid for these suppressors and requires that they cause frameshifts by another mechanism, presumably involving triplet recognition. Together with the recent structural data, these results greatly weaken, if not invalidate, the concept that translational step-size is defined explicitly by the tRNA anticodon.",

An explanation of this comes from what was thought initially to be an unrelated phenomenon, programmed frameshifting. This is a ubiquitous, although rare, event in which ribosomes are forced to shift reading frame at special sites in mRNAs. The process is stochastic; programmed-frameshift sites increase the probability of a frameshift occurring from the normally low level of random errors (<5 \u00d7 10?5 per codon) to as much as 50%.",

The mechanism of frame disruption varies between sites. In the most common form, termed -1 simultaneous-slippage frameshifting [21], the frameshift signal is a heptanucleotide of the form X-XXY-YYZ, grouped in codons of the upstream normal frame, where XXX is a triplet of any repeating nucleotide, YYY is a triplet repeat of either A or U, and Z varies between species. For example, the heptanucleotide in the Coronavirus Infectious Bronchitis Virus is U-UUA-AAC [22]. In most cases, a downstream secondary structure (a pseudoknot and a hairpin loop in eukaryotes and prokaryotes, respectively) causes the pause over this sequence (reviewed in Ref. [23]). Despite the number and phylogenetic ubiquity of such sites, we do not yet understand how these signals stimulate frameshift errors.",

            "text": "Recent work on a far less common form of programmed frameshifting provides mechanistic explanations of this process. Programmed +1 frameshifting in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, first identified in the Ty family of retrotransposons, also occurs at heptameric sequences, although of a different structure to those discussed above (reviewed in Ref. [23]). The sites consist of two codons of the normal frame plus a seventh base at the 3\u2032 end. The second codon is recognized very slowly in the ribosomal A site because of the low availability of its cognate tRNA. This pauses the ribosome with a pep-tRNA bound to the first codon in the ribosomal P site. Recent evidence indicates that \u2018unconventional decoding\u2019 by this pep-tRNA can directly stimulate frameshift errors by out-of-frame binding of an incoming aa-tRNA [24]. Because of the redundancy of the genetic code, during translation each amino acid can be decoded by one of several tRNAs, termed isoacceptors. Conventional decoding uses an isoacceptor that can fully pair with the codon. For example, although the codons GCG and GCU both encode alanine; the former is read by a cognate tRNA with the anticodon CGC, whereas an isoacceptor with an IGC anticodon decodes the latter (both codons and anticodons are represented in 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 polarity). The term unconventional decoding refers to reading by tRNAs that have a less than optimal interaction with the mRNA. Reading of GCG by the IGC-tRNA would be an unconventional decoding event because a G\u2013I wobble interaction does not allow a normal Watson\u2013Crick base-pair. In fact, the juxtaposition of the two purines at the wobble position would introduce a clash that destabilizes RNA\u2013RNA helices.",

Because their structural genes have been deleted, some cognate tRNAs are either present in low concentration or are absent [25]. This unconventional decoding can result in weak pyrimidine\u2013pyrimidine pairs or purine\u2013purine clashes in the wobble position. The presence of such unusual P-site wobble pairs causes frequent, erroneous out-of-frame decoding in the A site and results in frameshifts [24]. Because out-of-frame decoding competes with normal, in-frame decoding 26, 27, the occurrence of frameshifts is enhanced by the slow recognition of the next in-frame codon.",

This disruption might be incompatible with the normal structure of the wobble pair in the P site (shown in Fig. 3 as forcing breakage of the pair although, alternatively, this might disrupt ribosomal contacts with the codon\u2013anticodon pair). The high-energy cost required to form this structure would reduce the efficiency of out-of-frame recognition. By the same argument, because of the strain of the kink between the two sites, a non-canonical wobble-pair interaction in the P site might disturb formation of a normal codon\u2013anticodon interaction in the A site (Fig. 3c) and reduce the efficiency of in-frame decoding. Such an effect on nonsense suppression has been observed 29, 30. In this case, out-of-frame recognition still requires displacement of the skipped nucleotide (Fig. 3d). However, if the abnormal structure of the P-site wobble pair itself forces disruption of ribosomal interactions, it would eliminate the extra energy cost relative to in-frame decoding because both in-frame and out-of-frame aa-tRNAs would be precluded from forming their maximum-energy structure. This would reduce the energetic advantage of in-frame decoding and so should indirectly increase the probability of out-of-frame binding.",

            "text": "Experiments using drugs that induce errors demonstrate that minor disruptions to the structure of the ribosome\u2013mRNA\u2013tRNA complex can have profound effects on translational fidelity. Nucleotides A1492 and A1493 of the 16S rRNA undergo an energetically costly rearrangement when cognate tRNA enters the A site, which allows them to interact with the codon\u2013anticodon complex. Paromomycin stabilizes this conformation in the absence of tRNA and so reduces the energy difference between cognate and noncognate tRNA binding; by paying the cost of the rearrangement, paromomycin promotes both sense and frameshift errors [9]. We argue for an opposite effect in which an aberrant wobble-pair interaction in the P site reduces the energetic advantage of in-frame decoding, which indirectly increases the probability of out-of-frame binding. In this model, formation of the correct wobble-pair interaction in the P site is crucial to continued in-frame decoding. This is consistent with the effect of unusual wobble interactions in programmed frameshifting [24], and with the fact that wobble in the P site is constrained by a pincer interaction by two rRNA nucleotides: C1400 and m2G966 [10]. It is probably significant that of the nucleotides that contact the codon\u2013anticodon complex within the P site, only mutation of C1400 increases the occurrence of frameshifts and other errors [31]. Similarity between the effects of a C1400 mutation and an unusual wobble pair implies that they might increase the probability of out-of-frame recognition in the Asite in similar ways. In-frame recognition in the A site could be ensured by holding the P-site wobble-pair tightly between C1400 and m2G966. Although we lack details of the way these two residues interact with the codon\u2013anticodon complex in the P site, their inability to interact with abnormal, non-Watson\u2013Crick base-pairs could explain why an unusual wobble pair disrupts normal, in-frame decoding.",

Recent data also show that frameshifts induced by +1 suppressor tRNAs occur in competition with normal in-frame decoding of the succeeding codon [20], as occurs in programmed +1 frameshifting. An additional nucleotide in the anticodon loop might disrupt the correct interaction of the P-site rRNA with the codon\u2013anticodon complex, which could increase the probability of out-of-frame recognition despite the fact that the suppressor continues to make three base-pairs with the mRNA. This is plausible because we know that the additional nucleotide in the sufD42 suppressor form of tRNAPro slows recognition in the A site, and allows another isoacceptor to read its cognate codon [20]. This misreading does not happen with wild-type tRNA.",

Direct biochemical tests are now necessary to determine whether the inferences drawn from the genetics are correct; that is, that maintaining the reading frame depends crucially on the stability of the pep-tRNA wobble-pair binding in the P site. Of the different forms of programmed frameshifting, it is easiest to hypothesize that programmed +1 frameshifting in yeast results from direct disruption of the translational-accuracy mechanism. For example, an mRNA sequence found at one programmed +1 frameshift site in yeast appears to stimulate errors by base pairing with, and inactivating, helix 18 of the small ribosomal subunit rRNA, which is an essential element of the ribosomal-accuracy mechanism 6, 32. It remains to be seen whether other forms of programmed, unconventional decoding also disrupt error correction by the ribosome. Given the diversity of these decoding events, the ways in which they could undermine accuracy could also be diverse. The diversity of these programmed events is consistent with the results of the structural studies, which show that the ribosome uses an elaborate system to maintain translational accuracy. Therefore, by studying unconventional decoding systems we can dissect the mechanisms of translational accuracy, a process that is crucial to the cell. Recoding systems should continue to provide tools to dissect this still incompletely understood system.",
