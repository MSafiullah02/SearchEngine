In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has ranked vaccines and widespread sanitation as being responsible for the significant decrease in vaccine-preventable disease incidence and deaths [1]. This has been accomplished in two major ways: first, by the development of safe and effective vaccines; and second, by the widespread utilization of these vaccines among the populace. Both these conditions face threats and new challenges in the third millennium. The first challenge is the need to develop new technologies that enable faster and directed vaccine development for hyper-variable and complex disease-causing organisms, and the need for safe and effective adjuvants that can be used to direct and amplify protective immune responses. The second major challenge is the necessity for the populace, as a whole, to voluntarily accept these vaccines as important determinants of their wellbeing and health. In this review, we outline these challenges (see Figure 1\n) and suggest how they can be met (see Figure 2\n) in the third millennium.",

Over the past year, significant progress has been rapidly made on vaccines for prevention of Ebola virus disease [5, 6, 7, 8]. The design of clinical vaccine trials in the midst of ongoing outbreaks using novel cluster randomized controlled trial designs with ring vaccination is a notable early third-millennium achievement [9]. However, as important as this study design is, would it not have been better if an effective vaccine had already been developed and available?",

The authors propose that vaccine development is currently facing a crisis due to several factors: first, the pathogens for which we lack vaccines are complex and require significant investment; second, there are fewer vaccine manufacturers that are able to contribute the required resources for development of new vaccines; and third, the current business model prioritizes the development of vaccines with large market potential [10\u2022\u2022]. Vaccine development for other emerging infections (e.g. Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS; severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS; Chikungunya; West Nile; Dengue; Zika; and Lyme) face these same roadblocks (Table 2\n).",

Antigenic changes in influenza viruses require us to reformulate and administer the vaccines every year. We and others have demonstrated that host genetics (SNPs in HLA and other immune response genes) and other host factors may play a significant role in variations in adaptive immune response to vaccination, including vaccine failure [15\u2022\u2022, 16, 17, 18, 19].",

For example, the short-term efficacy of the live virus herpes zoster vaccine was demonstrated to be 69.8% in a randomized study of over 22 500 vaccine recipients [22]. Zoster vaccine efficacy was shown to decrease with increasing age at vaccination [23]. An AS01-adjuvanted varicella-zoster virus glycoprotein E (gE) subunit vaccine has undergone clinical trials where it demonstrated acceptable safety and enhanced immunogenicity; the vaccine is under review by the FDA with likely approval in 2017 [24, 25]. The world's first tetravalent dengue vaccine has been recently approved for the prevention of dengue infection that is caused by all four dengue virus serotypes in children and adults 9\u201345 years of age [26]. Two seasonal influenza vaccines, the MF59-adjuvanted influenza vaccine and the high-dose influenza vaccine, are now licensed for use in older adults (\u226565 years of age). It has been shown that the MF59 adjuvant increases humoral immune response to various influenza strains, including cross-reactive strains [27, 28]. A large influenza vaccine study in 7082 individuals demonstrated significantly higher immunogenicity of MF59-adjuvanted vaccine compared to a conventional non-adjuvanted influenza vaccine for both homologous and heterologous influenza A strains [29]. The immunogenicity and efficacy of high-dose influenza vaccine (60 \u03bcg hemagglutinin per strain), compared to standard-dose vaccine (15 \u03bcg hemagglutinin per strain), was assessed in a large vaccine study in 31 989 older individuals, which demonstrated the higher immunogenicity of high-dose influenza vaccine compared to conventional vaccine and the improved protection against influenza [30]. However, there is some evidence that AS03 adjuvants used in pandemic influenza vaccines may be associated with the development of autoimmune and neurological disorders like narcolepsy [31]. Thus, we need a better understanding of determinants of vaccine immunogenicity \u2014 both markers that correlate with protection (innate and adaptive antibody and T-cell-mediated cellular) and those that control vaccine failure [32].",

Advancements in healthcare have contributed to the aging of the global population and the growing number of persons with immunocompromising medical conditions. Along the same lines, the population of many developed nations is aging rapidly and so the impact of immunosenescence, or the age-related decline in immune function, must be considered. This is especially important for diseases, such as influenza, with a disproportionate public health impact on older individuals. Additional vaccine strategies are needed to overcome the immunosenescence and immunodeficiencies of these populations. Further efforts are also needed to better understand age-related and gender-related changes and defects in the regulation and function of innate and adaptive immune responses to vaccines. This will be essential to the development of vaccines or treatments that overcome immunosenescence [51, 52, 53].",

Generally speaking, this subset believes that vaccines have a higher potential to be dangerous than actually contracting the disease, leading them to make choices against vaccination.

When healthcare workers (HCWs) seek to understand an individual's preferred cognitive style and communicate with them based on that style, they can help address vaccine hesitancy in a way that the patient best understands. As a result, the patient may choose to engage in healthy behaviors and choices. The task of processing vaccine hesitancy or rejection with a patient is extremely important, and to do so in such a way that the patient has the best chance of making a wise decision. The Preferred Cognitive Styles and Decision-Making model emphasizes that medicine is increasingly moving to a more individualized style of care, and using a patient's preferred cognitive style (thus employing psychology and mental health within the medical office) allows patients to engage with an even more personalized style of care, while increasing the probability that through health education patients make better informed vaccine decisions [54\u2022, 55, 56].",

Vaccinomics is a collaborative approach that brings together biology, computer science, statistics, and bioinformatics. Together, these multidisciplinary teams perturb the immune system in carefully controlled ways and collect high-dimensional datasets characterizing the immune response at multiple levels (the transcriptome, the epigenome, the proteome, the metabolome, the lipidome \u2014 including individual molecules, cell populations and surface/functional phenotypes, and tissues/organs). The data is then organized, integrated, and mined using sophisticated computer algorithms and bioinformatics approaches in order to develop predictive and/or mechanistic models of immune function [76]. These models are then tested in a new round of experimentation that, in turn, yields additional insights and raises more biological questions.",

This, in turn, requires stable and sustained investment, and a more seamless integration of vaccine financing from basic research, to preclinical development, to clinical development, to population utilization. Currently, this route is expensive, fragmented, discordant, disconnected, and uncertain. This state of affairs leads to more expense, delays in bringing new vaccine candidates into clinical trials, and results in continuing unmet public health needs. A recent editorial reviewed some of these issues and suggested the development of a global vaccine development fund [10\u2022\u2022]. We find this novel concept to be compelling, as it is highly likely to galvanize the necessary teams of scientists and financial and regulatory infrastructure needed in order to make achievable progress and meet the needs of a diverse and changing global public health need.",

(b) Re-emerging pathogens that current vaccines: have been unable to control or eradicate, elicit marginally protective immunity, have unwanted side effects (rotavirus), require multiple booster immunizations (hepatitis B), or require yearly vaccine reformulation (influenza). (c) Funding and regulatory issues can be formidable obstacles to the successful research, development, clinical testing, and licensure of new vaccines. These factors may also act as disincentives to even consider vaccine development. (d) Anti-vaccination groups are increasingly vocal in their opposition to vaccination. Current communication technologies allow them to rapidly and widely spread their messages against vaccines. As a result safety standards are considerably higher now and public opinion toward a new vaccine must now accurately gauged and considered to an extent never seen before.
