As the result of cross-specificity test, although there were significant amount of phages clones bound non-specifically to the other protein molecules, the selected phage clones showed higher affinity to SEB than the others. The non-specific binding of phage clones may be due to the hydrophobic regions in the phage coat protein. The SPR sensorgrams show that, phage 24 and phage 9 bind to SEB with a strong affinity. After DNA sequencing, the peptide of the phage clone with highest affinity was synthesized and the binding constant of peptide to SEB was determined by ITC. The results indicate that the selected peptides can be used as recognizing agents in biosensors. In addition to their high affinity, the small size they have, will be an important advantage in enhancing the sensitivity of biosensors like SPR.
