The gel was stained with silver nitrate as described earlier. 9 2.5 | RNA extraction, PCR/RT-PCR, and nucleotide sequencing 15 GBR positive stool specimens were genotyped using primers published earlier for VP7 gene. 16 RNA was denatured at 97\u00b0C for 5 min and was rapidly chilled on ice for 5 min. Briefly, the RT-PCR reaction was carried out with an initial reverse transcription step at 50\u00b0C for 30 min followed by PCR activation at 95\u00b0C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of amplification (60 s at 94\u00b0C, 30 s at 55\u00b0C, and 60 s at 68\u00b0C) with final extension at 68\u00b0C for 7 min in a thermal cycler. The SuperScript \u00ae III One-Step RT-PCR System with Platinum \u00ae Taq DNA Polymerase kit (Invitrogen) was used for both cDNA synthesis and PCR amplification in a single tube for detection of RNA viruses. All the PCR products were electrophoresed in 2% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide (0.5%) and visualized under UV transiluminator. PCR amplicons were excised from the gel for purification (QIAquick, Qiagen, Hilden Germany) and cycle sequencing was carried out using Big Dye Terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and ABI 3130XL genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Nucleotide sequence identity was determined through BLAST (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast). The phylogenetic tree was generated with Maxiumum Likelihood method using MEGA 6 software. 17 The nucleotide sequences of the strains of GBR infections observed in adults (median age 30 years) was in concordance with earlier reports. 18, 19 The low prevalence in children compared to adults has been suggested to be either due to low exposure of children to GBR or faecal shedding below the detection limit of the assay employed in the study. 20 In China, a series of widespread gastroenteritis epidemics affecting millions of people were reported to be caused by GBR. 18 Over the period, epidemics settled to sporadic focal outbreaks and after 1987, no such reports were available from China. In India, circulation of GBR in sporadic cases of gastroenteritis was revealed from the retrospective analysis of stool samples collected in 1993. 21 RNA PAGE analysis has been reported to be 100 000 times less sensitive as compared to RT-PCR assay 22 The correlation between viral load and severity of the disease has been shown earlier among gastroenteritis patients infected with GAR using quantitative real time PCR assay. 23 In view of this, GBR RNA PAGE positive and negative faecal specimens need to be tested by quantitative Real time PCR assay.",
