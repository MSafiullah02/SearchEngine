This disease, recognized as an infection with a new betacoronavirus by Dr Zhang Jixian from Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, has been spreading exponentially in almost all countries around the world. The epicentre shifted from China to Europe in February/March 2020 and then to the USA in March/April 2020. Current data presenting information on international case numbers and case fatality are provided by the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) Coronavirus Resource Center (https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6).1,2 There are several other web-based resources that provide informative graphics on the spread of the disease and the outcomes. The pandemic of COVID-19 has multiple medical, psychological, and socio-economic consequences. COVID-19 represents probably the greatest threat that societies will face in the 21st century. Therefore, understanding its pathophysiology and clinical implications, and development of novel preventive and therapeutic strategies are of primary importance.",

The number of patients with comorbid conditions increased to about two-thirds in those requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission or those that did not survive. Patients with pre-existing CV conditions (hypertension in particular) had the highest morbidity (10.5%) following infection.7,8 Non-CV comorbidities, including diabetes, lung diseases, and obesity, the latter identified in current Italian and Dutch cohorts, are also major predictors of poor clinical outcomes. Similarly, in the recent analysis of 5700 Patients Hospitalized With COVID-19 in the New York City Area the most common comorbidities were hypertension (57%), obesity (42%), and diabetes (34%).167 These aspects emphasize the importance of the need for multidisciplinary assessment and treatment, including CV evaluation and therapy, during the course of COVID-19 to reduce mortality.

For example, a large number of healthcare workers and inpatients were exposed to COVID-19 in the hospital in the early, rather than the later phase in the pandemic in China.21 The demographics of patients in the early studies from China were different from those reported later in the largest aggregate study of COVID-19 patients by Guan et al. in China22 (Table 1).

Some in silico modelling of the infection expansion as well as in initial reports from Iceland and Italy suggest that an asymptomatic group, perhaps as high as 50% of infected individuals (DeCODE Genetics, Iceland), probably exists. This finding has considerable implications in estimating the prevalence and preventing spread of the disease. Likewise, some reports show that up to 80% of infected individuals have mild symptoms and in theory represent a group that might not seek medical care\u2014they might not, therefore, be tested or contribute to prevalence and case fatality rate (CFR) estimates. Secondly, practically all countries experience shortage of the testing kits, therefore limiting the testing only to selected groups of individuals. Moreover, some deaths caused by SARS-CoV-2 were not attributed to COVID-19, due to the lag time when severe complications tend to develop even up to 2\u20133 weeks following the initial infection.8",

Fibrinous exudate and high hyaline membranes fill alveolar cavities. Polynuclear giant cells are prominent. There is marked proliferation of type II alveolar epithelial cells. Such severe manifestations appear only in a fraction of patients. A recent study of COVID-19 cases in China reported up to 28 January 2020 indicated that severe illness may occur in 16% of cases,22 leading to an overall mortality rate estimated at 1.4% of the total reported cases22 to 4.61% in the WHO reports (accessed on 28 March 2020). In some geographical regions, due to unexplained reasons, mortality may be higher (current estimates are 11.9% in Italy, 9.0% in Spain, and 7.9% in the UK according to the JHU Coronavirus Resource Center, accessed on 2 April, 20202). It is important to note, however, that great care must be taken when calculating fatality rates based on currently available data, as these can be overestimated in relation to insufficient testing in the community or underestimated, due to long lag-time between test positivity and death or the fact that there are large differences in attributing COVID-related mortality (\u2018dying with\u2019 versus \u2018dying from\u2019 as well as differences in performing post-mortem testing). Limitations of healthcare systems, abruptly overwhelmed by a surge of patients needing mechanical invasive ventilation, have also been considered a potential source of the differences. Finally, these differences may result from population structure, as Italian patients have been older than the average age reported in the Chinese patients.",

In a recent analysis from China,22 it was present in 13.4% of subjects with non-severe disease and in 23.7% of subjects with severe disease. This study also included a composite outcome, which was also associated with a higher prevalence of hypertension in those with a poor composite outcome (35.8% vs. 13.7%). In the cohort of 44 672 patients reported by the China CDC,28 hypertension prevalence was reported as 12.8% in the whole group of patients and as 39.7% in patients who eventually died.28 Hypertension was reported to increase the odds ratio (OR) for death by 3.05 (95% CI 1.57\u20135.92)32 in patients with COVID-19. These associations may, however, be largely confounded by the higher prevalence of hypertension in older people, as older individuals have significantly worse outcomes, more severe course of the disease, and a higher mortality rate than the younger patients.22 Thus, in summary, while hypertension does appear to be associated with more severe disease, a higher risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and increased mortality in unadjusted analyses, there is no strong evidence to indicate increased susceptibility of patients with hypertension to COVID-19, when the association is adjusted for other risk factors.33",

            "text": "The mechanisms of this possible relationship and their clinical relevance have been reviewed in a recent statement of the European Society of Hypertension.33 The putative relationship between hypertension and COVID-19 may relate to the role of ACE2. ACE2 is a key element in the renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system (RAAS), which is critically involved in the pathophysiology of hypertension.34 Experimental studies demonstrated that inhibition of the RAAS with ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) may result in a compensatory increase in tissue levels of ACE2,35 leading to suggestions that these drugs may be detrimental in patients exposed to SARS-CoV-2.36 It is important, however, to emphasize that there is no clear evidence that ACEIs or ARBs lead to up-regulation of ACE2 in human tissues.36 Thus, currently there is no justification for stopping ACEIs or ARBs in patients at risk of COVID-19.33 This has now been endorsed officially by many learned Societies, including the European Society of Hypertension, the International Society of Hypertension, and the European Society of Cardiology.33 It also appears that in experimental models some RAAS blockers may exert a potentially protective influence.37 Indeed, while angiotensin II promoted the internalization and intracellular degradation of ACE2, losartan reduced this effect, suggesting that ARBs may offer protection against viral entry into cells.36 The recent integrative antiviral drug repurposing analysis implicated another ARB\u2014irbesartan\u2014as a potential repurposable medication for COVID-19.10 In fact, the known effect of ARBs on potassium metabolism may be seen as clinically advantageous in patients infected by COVID-19 given that hypokalaemia was reported as a fairly common manifestation of COVID-19 (possibly through increased kaliuresis rather than gastrointestinal loss).38 Hypokalaemia in COVID-19 patients is difficult to manage, correlates with the severity of the disease, and has been suggested to be driven by activation of the RAAS.38 ACEIs or ARBs might offer some protection in this setting. It also needs to be emphasized that hypokalaemia has not been reported in other studies. For example, in a patient characterization by Guan et al.,22 the median value of the potassium level reported was 3.8 mmol/L with the lower margin of the interquartile range (IQR) at 3.5 mmol/L. Nevertheless, antihypertensive medications known to increase serum levels of potassium (including carvedilol and eplerenone) were implicated as potential drug repurposing opportunities for patients with COVID-19 infection.10 Moreover, observations from ICUs in Italy suggest that hypocalcaemia is a common metabolic abnormality in patients infected by COVID-19, that could be linked due to reduced albumin levels, which are commonly seen, and/or Ca2+ consumption through excessive activation of the coagulation cascade.",

Given that acute myocardial injury is said to begin 2 weeks after the onset of symptomatic COVID-19,32 adaptive T-cell-mediated immunity or dysregulated innate effector pathways are likely to play a pivotal in the development of myocardial inflammation. In this context, it is notable that an increase of highly proinflammatory CCR6+ Th17 in CD4+ T cells, prominent inflammatory mediators of myocarditis,56 has been reported in severe cases.",

Moreover, a recent single-cell atlas of the human heart indicated that pericytes express particularly high levels of ACE2 in the heart.47 One of the implications of this finding is possible local microvascular inflammation during SARS-CoV-2 infection of the pericytes, leading to severe microvascular dysfunction, contributing to myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA). This could explain recent reports of the clinical course of cases of MI during COVID-19. In addition, the cytokine storm can contribute to development of endothelial dysfunction through well-characterized mechanisms.62\u201365",

Pathological investigations in COVID-19 victims23 have demonstrated splenic atrophy, with a very significant reduction in the number of lymphocytes and neutrophils, as well as necrosis and haemorrhages. Similarly, lymphocytes are depleted in lymph nodes and the numbers of both CD4+ and CD8+ cells are decreased.23 This corresponds to lymphopenia in peripheral blood observed in severe cases. Interestingly, an increase in systemic IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), and tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) has been observed in subjects with COVID-19,6 which corresponds to the characteristics of a cytokine release syndrome (CRS).16,68,69 CRS development in COVID-19 is associated with COVID-19 severity. CRS has been characterized as a complication of immune targeted therapies in oncology, in particular in relation to severe chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell-induced CRS.70 It is also reminiscent of the cytokine profile noted in haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) syndromes.71 Resemblance to the latter brought considerations that COVID-19 may be a cause of secondary HLH with cytopenias, significant haemophagocytosis in bone marrow, and low fibrinogen concentration. Clinical classifications have been introduced to aid recognition of secondary HHL.71 Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analyses of COVID-19 active cases have also shown hyperactivated T lymphocytes with large fractions of HLA-DR+ and CD38+ CD8+/CD4+ T cells and CCR6+ Th17 CD4+ cells. High concentrations of cytotoxic granules in cytotoxic T (CD8) cells have been observed. Thus, uncontrolled overactivation of T cells may account for, in part, the severe immune injury,16 similarly to atherosclerosis and other CV conditions.72,73 These aspects should also be considered in the light of sexual dimorphism related to susceptibility to CV inflammation.74\u201376",

This has prompted several studies evaluating the role of IL-6 antagonism by monoclonal antibodies in COVID-19. For example, the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA) approved the clinical study \u2018Tocilizumab in COVID-19 Pneumonia (TOCIVID-19)\u2019 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04317092). This multicentre, single-arm, open-label, phase II study will assess mortality at 1 month in 330 patients affected by COVID-19 pneumonia. The inclusion criteria comprise patients showing signs of respiratory distress syndrome or who had been subject to tracheal intubation in the preceding 24 h. The study will be led by the Instituto Nazionale Tumori IRCCS \u2013 Fondazione Pascale in Naples. Similarly, 30 participants will be enrolled in the Marche region, in the interventional clinical trial \u2018Tocilizumab (RoActemra) as Early Treatment of Patients Affected by SARS-CoV-2 Infection With Severe Multifocal Interstitial Pneumonia\u2019 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04315480). In the USA, the \u2018Evaluation of the Efficacy and Safety of Sarilumab in Hospitalized Patients With COVID-19\u2019 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04315298) has just started, aiming to recruit 400 patients, and will be shortly followed by the \u2018Tocilizumab to Prevent Clinical Decompensation in Hospitalized, Non-critically Ill Patients With COVID-19 Pneumonitis (COVIDOSE)\u2019 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04331795) trial, which is expected to start very soon. Finally, the most recently registered trial recruiting 330 patients: A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Tocilizumab in Patients With Severe COVID-19 Pneumonia (COVACTA) (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04320615) is being initiated. Similar trials have been registered in France, Belgium, and Denmark. It should be noted, however, that there are currently no published clinical trial data on IL-6 targeting safety or efficacy against the virus. Moreover, tocilizumab has not received approval from China\u2019s National Medical Product Administration to be sold for COVID-19 treatment.",

Furthermore, disease pathology was reduced in the presence of the ARB losartan. Intriguingly, in acute lung disease triggered by acid respiration or sepsis, ACE2 has also been shown to be directly protective, acting in partnership with the angiotensin type 2 receptor (AT2R), and administration of recombinant ACE2 in this model is protective.103 Taking together the evidence from multiple experimental studies, beneficial effects of ACEIs or ARBs and also ACE2 supplementation in various animal models of lung injury or SARS have been shown and supported the concept that loss of ACE2 expression promotes the disease in lung injury models (reviewed in Kreutz et al., 202025). ACE2 is also directly regulated by cytokines.104 Decreased ACE2 levels could be a direct consequence of viral infection and/or the subsequent inflammatory and immune responses that occur in the infected lung. Interestingly, ACE2 is also reported to be detectable in macrophages,105 and its knockout in leucocytes promotes adipose inflammation,106 highlighting a role for ACE2 in the inflammatory response. Patients suffering from SARS have overwhelming immune and inflammatory responses and high mortality rates from acute respiratory failure, and furthermore they are also associated cardiac sequelae. For example, SARS patients also suffer from systolic and diastolic dysfunction and arrythmias, leading to sudden death.107,108 In murine models, intranasal administration of human SARS-CoV results in ACE2-mediated infection of the myocardium.109 These observations support a role for SARS-CoV in direct myocardial infection and a possible causative role in cardiac disease subsequent to respiratory infection. In the murine heart, ACE2 was also almost completely down-regulated at the protein level following infection. Moreover, in autopsied cardiac tissue from SARS patients with SARS-CoV-positive lung infection, viral RNA was detected in the heart, combined with decreased cardiac ACE2 protein levels and elevated cardiac macrophage infiltration. Down-regulation of ACE2 without compensatory effects on ACE may lead to the RAAS being tipped towards the detrimental ACE\u2013Ang II\u2013AT1R axis and away from the protective ACE2\u2013Ang-(1-7)\u2013Mas axis.",

In fact, viral vector-mediated overexpression of ACE2 in rodents also protects the heart from adverse cardiac remodelling and dysfunction post-MI.113 Overall, these findings highlight that ACE2 has a key protective function in both the lung and the heart. Therefore, SARS-CoV infection-mediated down-regulation of ACE2, as a direct mechanistic consequence of viral infection and/or as a result of the subsequent inflammatory responses, may lead to an imbalance in RAAS signalling and consequent CV sequelae. The knowledge that systemic spread of SARS from primary lung infection to other CV tissues, including the heart, is also important. Given that ACE2 functions as a receptor for virus entry into the cell, down-regulation of ACE2 upon infectioin with SARS-CoV is expected to prevent further viral entry, serving as a negative regulatory mechanism. Clearly additional investigations are needed to increase our understanding of the pathological mechanisms of acute disease and potential increased CV risk in COVID-19 patients.",

Numerous antiviral therapies have been used to try and limit viral replication. These include protease inhibitors such as liponovir/ritonavir (used for the treatment of HIV). However, a recent rapid randomized non-placebo-controlled trial including 100 patients in each arm showed no difference in the outcome.116 Remdesivir is a nucleotide analogue and polymerase inhibitor that was previously used for the experimental treatment of Ebola in a large phase III study.117 While it had an acceptable safety profile, the remdesivir (GS-5734) arm was halted due to a higher antiviral efficacy of monoclonal antibodies in the trial. Finally chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine have been suggested as having antiviral activity against many RNA viruses including SARS and SARS-CoV-2, through an increase of the endosomal pH and interference with the glycosylation process.118 However, it has never been shown conclusively to have an antiviral effect in vivo. In alphavirus infection, while demonstrating an antiviral effect in vitro, it was found not to be associated with clinical effects in a randomized clinical trial and may even be associated with prolonged viraemia in vivo.119 While these observations cannot be directly translated to COVID-19, large phase III trials are underway with hydroxychloroquine, that will inform about the possible therapeutic value of this approach.

Thus, the effect of short-term use of these medications for patients without these underlying conditions is not clear. Remdesivir is an experimental drug used in the treatment of Ebola.117 Thus, its CV effects and toxicities are unknown. The antimalarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have recently received considerable attention and interest for the treatment and possible prophylaxis of COVID-19. However, the data to date in support of these drugs are weak and cardiac toxicities are considerable. A systematic review of the literature performed on patients treated with these drugs, albeit for an extended period of time (median 7 years) and with a high cumulative dose, demonstrated conduction disorders as the main side effect (85%).122 Other adverse cardiac events included ventricular hypertrophy (22%), hypokinesia (9.4%), heart failure (26.8%), pulmonary arterial hypertension (3.9%), and valvular dysfunction (7.1%). Cardiac function normalizes in a significant number of patients (44.9%) upon withdrawal of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, while others continue to show irreversible damage (12.9%) or death (30.8%).122 Thus, careful consideration should be given to the use of these drugs, particularly without stronger data regarding their efficacy. Of note, tocilizumab treatment has been shown to influence lipid metabolism in RA patients. Following tocilizumab, total-, LDL-, and HDL-cholesterol were increased, while CV risk biomarkers such as HDL-SAA, secretory phospholipase A2 IIA, and lipoprotein(a) were significantly reduced.123 Very recently, the ENTRACE clinical trial supported the CV safety of tocilizumab in RA patients;124 however, to date, IL-6 targeting has not been tested for secondary prevention in CVD.\n",

The mechanisms through which CVDs worsen the prognosis in COVID-19 are unknown. It remains to be addressed to what extent individual CVDs are exacerbated by COVID-19. Do pre-existing hypertension and CVDs increase infection risk and/or worsen the course of disease progression? Is the severity of CVDs related to high expression levels of ACE2, the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, in the heart and blood vessels? What influence, if any, do inhibitors of the RAAS have on susceptibility to COVID-19 and its clinical outcomes? What are the factors or therapies for CVDs that may confer protective effects against COVID-19 and its clinical outcomes? How does pre-existing CVD worsen cardiac involvement specifically? What transferable knowledge can be learned about this pathogen that would advance our understanding of CV risk for SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and other virus infections in the future? Finally, probably the most important question remains, what are the determinants of heterogeneous host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection? The answers will be found in integrated approaches by CV immunological ID and other expertise coming together. The use of systems based on hypothesis-free in silico methodologies will be essential. This pandemic is unlike any other in arriving at the same time as humankind being in possession of remarkable molecular data science and informatic tools.

Upon the viral spike protein priming by the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), SARS-CoV-2 uses the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to enter and infect the cell. Inhibiting TMPRSS2 activity (by camostat mesylate) could be used to prevent proteolytic cleavage of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and protect the cell against virus\u2013cell fusion (1). Another approach could be neutralizing the virus from entering cells and keeping it in solution by activation of a disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 (ADMA17) which leads to shedding of the membrane-bound ACE2 and release of the soluble extracellular domain of ACE2 (2); with treatment with anti-ACE2 antibodies leading to blockage of the interaction between virus and receptors (3) or administration of soluble recombinant human ACE2 protein acting as a competitive interceptor for SARS-CoV-2 (4). Alternatively, purified polyclonal antibodies targeting/neutralizing the viral spike protein may offer some protection against SARS-CoV-2 (5). Interestingly, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), frequently used to treat hypertension, could alter ACE2 expression and intensify the SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

In particular, the infection of endothelial cells or pericytes could lead to severe microvascular and macrovascular dysfunction. Furthermore, in conjunction with the immune over-reactivity, it can potentially destabilize atherosclerotic plaques and explain the development of the acute coronary syndromes. Infection of the respiratory tract, particularly of type 2 pneumocytes, by SARS-CoV-2 is manifested by the progression of systemic inflammation and immune cell overactivation, leading to a \u2018cytokine storm\u2019, which results in an elevated level of cytokines such as IL-6, IL-7, IL-22, and CXCL10. Subsequently, it is possible that activated T cells and macrophages may infiltrate infected myocardium, resulting in the development of fulminant myocarditis and severe cardiac damage. This process could be further intensified by the cytokine storm.
