Another confounding factor is the non-availability of operating day for neurosurgery in our center causing significant delay in the review and intervention of neurosurgical patients. This leaves the unit with very few elective cases. Appropriate surgical instruments are not provided by the hospital in the government extension. This leaves the surgeon with no choice but to acquire his own equipment to ease his services which thus affects patient care.",

It is imperative that the first approach in improving the practice of neurosurgery in rural settings is conceptualization and implantation of the setup. Setting up neurosurgical services includes training of neurosurgeons and allied health staff as was done in the Peruvian setup [14] . Subsequently is sequential provision of materials for neurosurgical services with regard to provision of good transportation services, means of communication, readily provision of equipment to aid investigation (imaging modalities such as computerized tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging) and equipment intervention for both basic and complex neurosurgical cases as well as a proper intensive care unit with neuromonitoring facilities. If all these steps are followed and put in place, neurosurgical service will be at the doorstep of the rural dweller and thus reduced morbidity and mortality currently encountered on account of paucity of manpower and materials for effective service delivery. Training and re-training of other allied health workers like nurses and physiotherapist who are directly or indirectly involved in the management of a neurosurgical patient.",
