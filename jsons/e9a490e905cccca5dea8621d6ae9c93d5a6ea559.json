He had been found dead at home, a day after his nasopharyngeal swab had returned positive for SARS-COV-2, three days after the sample had been taken as an outpatient, over five weeks after first exhibiting possible symptoms. 3D-visualization was performed by visually discriminating correlates for aerated, poorly aerated and non-aerated lung regions. The visual side-by-side comparison with a control case shows the deterioration beyond any \"normal\" post-mortem finding, however. The PMCT findings in the lungs resemble those of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), while histologically identified inflammation also shows, in part binuclear, lymphocytes. In addition, acute liver dystrophy and acute tubular necrosis in the kidneys were found. Except coronary artery atherosclerosis, there appeared to be no remarkable pathology of the heart.",

As this pandemic from the view of risk assessment does constitute a black swan, underestimated fat tails as technical reason should be addressed by also analyzing apparent extreme single observations. This case of an outpatient (without hospital or intensive-care treatment) shows a pulmonary progression beyond the typical findings of COVID-19, to a non-specific picture of ARDS, where histologically, in part binuclear lymphocytes were remarked. What appeared to be an initially slow progression with final rapid escalation raises the question whether nasopharyngeal swabs alone or added pulmonary CT might be better for screening high-risk patients. The reported symptoms and relatively late medical consultation in this case appeared to contrast with the extensive pathology, raising the question whether any search for super-spreaders should not just focus on asymptomatic but under-reported symptomatic patients, and whether their prolonged circulation in everyday life would justify measures such as for example more extensive face mask policies. As post-mortem testing for SARS-COV-2 may not be available for every case, PMCT may provide sensitive testing for lung changes related to COVID-19. In order to allow for more precise medicolegal investigations in the context of COVID-19, however, any more specific extra tests may have to be financed by stakeholders in epidemiology, infectious disease or policy.",

He never made it there, but was found dead at home on the following day. To clarify manner and cause of death, a medicolegal investigation into his death was opened. Before autopsy, PMCT was obtained ( Fig. 1 and 2 ) that also showed absence of gas as indirect sign of probable absence of concurrent septicemia or bacterial infection [2] [3] [4] . The PMCT shows what appears to be a fatal case of a severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. The PMCT correlates for normally aerated lungs were identified between -900 and -500 Hounsfield units (HU), against which over-inflated (below -900 HU), poorly aerated (-500 to -100 HU) and nonaerated (above -100 HU) regions were differentiated on basis of density [5] . The visualizations in Figures 1 and 2 show a marked difference in the lung appearance compared to a control case. The details of the axial slice images are denoted in Figure 2 ; no reverse halo sign was identified. There appeared to be fluid in the maxillary and sphenoid sinuses. Bronchi and trachea appeared to be filled with fluid, whose PMCT surface characteristic was uneven, matching the autopsy finding of frothy fluid in the airways (see also Fig. 3 ). At autopsy, the heart of 340 g presented coronary artery atherosclerosis with pre-existing narrowing to 50% of the lumen of both the left anterior descending and right coronary arteries [6] , no macroscopic signs of myocardial ischemia, and no relevant histological findings (such as contraction band necroses, infarction, or inflammation) were noted. The lungs with 1780 g weight showed extensive Tardieu spots and an increased consistency, with haemorrhagic foam or frothy fluid, in bronchi and trachea (Fig. 3) . Microscopic features included congested blood vessels, some hyaline membranes, and patchy inflammation with lymphocytes (in part biand trinuclear). Histology of the liver that exhibited reduced consistency at autopsy was, other than macro-and microvesicular steatosis [7, 8] , a peracute liver dystrophy without inflammation; the kidney showed acute tubular necroses (Fig. 3) . No signs of postmortem decomposition were noted on PMCT or at autopsy.",

Here, an individual appeared to have reported only relatively mild symptoms, and was advised to stay home only for the three days preceding death. Post-mortem examination however showed large amounts of frothy fluid in trachea, bronchi and paranasal sinuses, which also may indicate a wet cough [55, 56] rather than a dry cough [40] in what appears to be a history with at least some symptoms stretching over around five weeks. Most of that time, this man can be assumed to have traveled and interacted freely with others. While over 99% in one series of COVID-19 patients [57] showed chest CT abnormalities, the frequencies of absent symptoms (no fever in 8,3%, no dyspnea in 73,3%, no cough in 25%) may also signify that there are those that under-report their illness and stay outside hospitals [58] . The reported symptoms and relatively late clinic consultation appeared to contrast with the extensive pathology, raising the question whether any search for super-spreaders should not just focus on socalled asymptomatic [59, 60] but also on under-reported symptomatic patients (already suspected in those suffering from chronic cough [61] ), and whether their prolonged circulation in everyday life would justify any measure of physical distancing, including the consideration of face masks [62, 63] . At our institute [64] , this has been taken into consideration for the latest recommendations regarding examination of deceased or live people in a forensic context. Thereby, in addition to usual protective gloves, surgical masks are recommended for all examinations for all people attending, whereas high-grade masks and a protective suit are required to protect the examiner in cases of known or strongly suspected COVID-19.",

One has to consider that naso-pharyngeal swabs and ensuing RT-PCR 3 evaluation may delay the diagnosis, while also turning out significant portions of false negatives [66] . If available, additional early pulmonary CT appears to offer both a relatively high speed and sensitivity [67] , albeit at lower specificity [68] . For forensic post-mortem examinations, we had already previously identified triage PMCT as valuable, particularly and also in the context of screening for correlates of possible infections [35] .",

With that, it is also relevant to note that forensic PMCT may show correlates of pathology that differ from a clinical setting [69] . This case was exceptional also in the way it was handled as \"reportable death\", because forensic work typically focuses on whether a crime was committed, without spending extra cost or effort. A conservative handling of Swiss procedures with regard to \"reportable deaths\" [70] risks to list most probable natural deaths as a result of assumed or possible acute cardiac failure. As relevant as that may appear to forensic investigations, this seems rather uninformative otherwise, and may definitely entail under-reporting of COVID-19 cases [58] when in fact, death with COVID-19 (as in: fall from great height, intoxication, road traffic accident, etc.), death caused by COVID-19 (as in: death of SARS-CoV-2 related ARDS, etc.), and death with or of COVID-19 under medical treatment (as in: experimental or cross-label medication was administered), might become a relevant distinction. Differentiating virus strains may be important, from view of epidemiology, rather than simple binary testing, seeing as if the clinical picture of COVID-19 and illness severity may differ across different viral strains (or subtype, or genetic variant) [71] , with a majority of fatal COVID-19 cases possibly including additional microbial agents, whose pathophysiological role may yet have to be clarified; there, elevated serum procalcitonin as possible indicator of bacterial (rather than viral) infection [72] had already been identified to correlate with clinical severity [73] .",
