This is the time when opening up society should be considered.

It is not known how often this hotline has been used. The government addressed the issue of disease stigma and compassion for those affected by providing food, frequent health checks, and encouragement for those under quarantine. This rapid response included hundreds of action items.",

On January 30, the NHA database was expanded to cover the past 14-day travel history for patients from China, Hong Kong, and Macau. On February 14, the Entry Quarantine System was launched, so travelers can complete the health declaration form by scanning a QR code that leads to an online form, either prior to departure from or upon arrival at a Taiwan airport. A mobile health declaration pass was then sent via SMS to phones using a local telecom operator, which allowed for faster immigration clearance for those with minimal risk. This system was created within a 72-hour period. On February 18, the government announced that all hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies in Taiwan would have access to patients' travel histories.",

One week after these measures were implemented, and after case numbers had grown six-fold to 402 cases, a strict national 3week lockdown beginning 26 March was initiated, which prohibited all movement for citizens not involved in designated essential services \"except under strictly controlled circumstances, such as to seek medical care, buy food, medicine and other supplies or collect a social grant.\" Despite the profound impact of the lockdown on an already tenuous economy -estimated reduction in growth by 2.6% translating into ~9% contraction of national GDP -the President announced a 2-week extension on 9 April, following an apparent reduction in the average daily infection rate from 42% to 4%. Critical challenges for transitioning to a risk-based containment strategy in South Africa include limited testing capacity -currently 75,000 tests have been performed; matching the per-capita testing of South Korea would require 400,000 tests -and lack of infrastructure to implement contact tracing and isolation for people living in dense peri-urban environments.",

Key lessons learned were impact of a single, missed case which resulted in nationwide outbreak and importance of early detection and isolation of cases[Oh MD et al. 2018].The development of the SARS-CoV-2 infection illustrates how rapid the numbers increase (Figure1). The numbers went from 2 daily cases to 909 from the 18th February to the 29 th February. As of 11 April 2020, a total of 10,480 confirmed cases and 211 deaths with fatality rate of 2.0% were reported. Extensive testing was applied to cases and contacts and a total of 510,479 tests or up to 18,000 per day were run to identify cases and contacts and quarantine them[Korean CDC 2020].Based on the lessons learned from the MERS-CoV outbreak in 2015, Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) intensified contact investigation and management of contacts with following measures: 1) interviewing patients and determining the location of the contacts (patient route) with complimentary methods including checking medical records, phone-based global positioning system (GPS), credit card transaction records and closed-circuit television (CCTV); 2) evaluation on risk of exposure; 3) classification of contact based on risk analysis and 4) management of contact (Korean CDC 2020). KCDC shared the epidemiologic information to the public in transparent manner. In order to effectively utilize health care resources, health authorities classified patients based on the severity with category of mild, moderate, severe and extremely severe. Mild cases were isolated and monitored at living and treatment support centers. Moderate, severe and extremely severe cases were immediately hospitalized for treatment. Korea expanded special procedures to all travellers since March 19 and is requiring a 14-day self-quarantine or isolation in facilities for all travellers entering Korea from April 1 with symptom screening at point of entry and laboratory test at point of entry or within three days upon arrival.Public awareness campaign has been implemented including personal hygiene practices such as hand washing and wearing a mask when visiting clinics or hospitals. In order to minimize the dense working environment, measures such as telecommuting, flexible work, monitoring of fever or respiratory symptoms for employees were implemented. On 21 th March 2020, social distancing measure were recommended up to 19 th April including limit the operation of facilities of indoor sports and entertainment and replacement of religious gatherings with on-line ceremony. School opening has postponed and replaced to on-line education.

This includes holding regular exercises, and building the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), a 330-bed purpose built infectious diseases management facility with integrated clinical, laboratory and epidemiological functions.",
