On the other hand, immunosuppression itself may dampen the abnormal immune response that seems to be responsible for the most severe disease complications such as interstitial pneumonia [8] . Indeed, two immune-modulating drugs largely used for immune-mediated disorders, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and chloroquine, have demonstrated some antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and in small clinical studies [9] . Similarly, tocilizumaban anti-interleukin (IL)-6 receptor antibody approved for different rheumatic diseasesproved effective in severe SARS-CoV-2 cases [10] , although these data warrant confirmation by controlled trials.",

Furthermore, also the female predominance of systemic autoimmune diseases might represent a protective feature, as growing studies suggest gender differences in the SARS-CoV-2 infection, with women being less (severely) affected than men [14] . Of interest, a high proportion of patients with symptoms compatible with SARS-CoV-2 had an active disease, further suggesting that active immune responses might be associated with a higher susceptibility to the infection, which however could not be confirmed in most symptomatic patients.",
