While \u2022 G8 meetings have increased focus on GHG issues and raised new forms of funding, it could be argued that rather than con fi rming the control of the GHG agenda by the existing agencies such as WHO, this has increased fragmentation. The \u2022 G20 is sometimes talked of as being a new global compact, being more inclusive than the G8 and introducing North-South dialogue. The opportunity exists for G20 to take forward GHG issues in a way that would coordinate action and reinforce the overall leadership of this issue by the WHO. between domestic and international concerns. These trends are illustrated by the intensi fi cation of fears about pandemics such as SARS and Avian fl u and threats of bio-terrorism in the mail, ports and airports and by the higher pro fi le of issues such as AIDS-with levels of death rivaling those of the 1919 in fl uenza.",

Of course this is more dif fi cult at the G20 which inevitably has more of the atmosphere of a public concert than a private club.
