Case 1 presented as an upper respiratory tract infection, and Case 2 presented with mild diarrhea only. Compared with their parents and to previous reported adults with COVID-19, the two cases in our study showed relatively mild clinical manifestations and recovered soon. Their chest CTs were normal. The clinical features in these two patients are different from previous reports in pediatric cases. A report of a family cluster demonstrated an asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities and positive SARS-CoV-2 test [8] . And another report demonstrated an infected case with very severe pneumonia [9] . These reports showed that children infected with SARS-CoV-2 may have variable symptoms, which may be partly related to the previous health status and interval from onset to consultation and comorbidities. Experts recently have formulated a recommendation for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 in children, which is of paramount important for clinical practice [10, 11] . Owing to the limited number of pediatric cases and experiences, these recommendations or guidelines were based mainly on standards and experiences with adult patients [10] . Additional data from pediatric cases need to be collected to further recognize the clinical features of COVID-19 in children.",

Close contact in the family is the main transmission way of infection in children. Pediatric patients may present as asymptomatic or only with mild symptoms of respiratory or gastrointestinal system with normal chest CT images, and thus easily be missed. Our study highlights the importance that pediatricians be vigilant in treating patients with a travel history to areas of the epidemic, or with family cluster, to ensure an early diagnosis, early quarantine and early treatment.",
