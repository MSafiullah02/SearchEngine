During normal times, individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are among the most vulnerable persons in society, depending on family or professional caregivers for their day to day survival. This pandemic exacerbates further their vulnerability, due to both the morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 and the indirect effects of the pandemic on the social supports and the health care system on which they depend.",

Those with more severe dementias will not be able to understand, appreciate, or remember most of these recommendations due to the severity of their short-term memory loss and overall cognitive impairment.

As discussed above, features of moderate to severe dementia such as severe memory impairment, and BPSD such as wandering, and agitation may thwart attempts to promote the actions recommended to reduce risk of transmission. In the other direction, imposition of increased hand hygiene, isolation, or restriction of visitors and activities may worsen cognitive symptoms or BPSD, increasing further care needs and risks.",

Hospital staff and physicians are highly vulnerable to contracting COVID-19: of the first 48,548 confirmed cases in China (as of February 14, 2020), 1,716 (3.7%) were health care workers and professionals, 2 as were 2,026 (9.0%) of the first 22,512 confirmed cases in Italy (as of March 15, 2020) . 3 The risk of COVID-19 nosocomial infection is high due to high staff ratios and turnover, high patient volumes, crowded rooms, rapid inflow of detected and undetected cases of COVID-19, and constrained supply of PPE. For reasons discussed above (age, comorbidities, behavioral and cognitive problems), individuals with ADRD are among those at highest risk of nosocomial infection. In many communities affected by COVID-19, hospitals get strained or overwhelmed. 9 Hospitalized individuals with ADRD may be particularly affected because they are less able to monitor their care or advocate for themselves. Decreased nursing time has been shown to be associated with increased medical errors and adverse events in dementia. 16 The need for hospitalization implies a more severe illness. Patients with severe BPSD may be at even higher risk for the behaviours discussed above that elevate transmission of infection. On a South Korean psychiatric ward, 101 of 103 inpatients were infected and 7 died during a COVID19 outbreak. 17 Upon admission, hospitals need to evaluate the risk to individuals with ADRD and the risk to others, in the context of potential, suspected, or confirmed cases of COVID-19. Planning for these situations is needed to clarify the ethical issues, local legal framework, and institutional policies that impact a decision with respect to the need for and use of locked seclusion, chemical and physical restraints, and end of life or palliative care in high risk situations. 18 Regardless of choices made by patients with ADRD or their family members, health care interventions taken for granted may have to be rationed in some jurisdictions affected by the pandemic (see below).",

However, this issue goes beyond COVID-19 and pneumonia. As discussed above, during this pandemic, many patients with ADRD who want to receive the full spectrum of care, including intensive care and intubation, may not be able to access optimal acute care for any medical issue, not just COVID-19. All physicians may have to treat a variety of medical issues that would have otherwise been treated by specialists.

The pandemic and its social consequences may cause fear, anxiety, and anger. They will disrupt all forms of social interaction, possibly for a prolonged period of time. A lack of physical closeness may lead to increased loneliness and sadness. Exercise is recommended generally and specifically for individuals with ADRD, and confinement reduces access to exercise. Sleep disturbances is common in ADRD and sleep may be further disrupted due to anxiety and loss of social rhythms (-zeitgeists\u2016). 25 In turn, lack of activities and sleep loss and stimulation may cause delirium in individuals with ADRD, contributing further to morbidity and mortality. 26 Like health care workers, individuals with ADRD may experience the loss of friends and family due to COVID-19. These losses may lead to grief, bereavement, or frank depression, a common feature of ADRD. 27 The pandemic and its consequences may also be experienced as a trauma, followed by post-traumatic stress disorder. In turn, stress and trauma can accelerate cognitive decline. 28 Age, illness, depression, trauma, and dementia are all risk factors for suicide. 29 During the pandemic, individuals with ADRD may be doubly stigmatized. Stigma is already a pervasive issue in ADRD. 30 Individuals with, or at risk of exposure to, COVID-19 have been stigmatized. 31 Risks of stigma include ostracization and denial of health and social services, 31 which comes at time of potential scarcity of resources to be allocated. 32 Rationing raises triage issues beyond some of the logistical issues discussed above. Will older individuals with mild ADRD be able to access intensive care beds? If they are already on a ventilator, will they be taken off to reallocate these scarce resources to younger patients? How will these decisions be made ethically? What will be the psychological impact of triage on health professionals? A response to these complex questions is beyond the scope of this paper.",

Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) and Data and Safety Management Boards (DSMBs) would also need to be involved in reassessing the risk/benefit ratio of continuing participation in these studies. A few clinical trials may consider not just to continue following and monitoring current participants, but also to recruit new participants. Except for some rare trials of purely psychosocial interventions, baseline assessments and safety lab tests would require in-person visits. Again, this would require the involvement of the IRB and DSMB and careful discussion with possible participants or their SDM and documentation of this consent process.",

            "text": "As with any major crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic will have a lasting impact on the way all clinical research, including ADRD research, is carried out. The current challenging situation is forcing researchers to think how they could conduct most research procedures remotely. It will accelerate the adoption of technologies and tools that permit remote assessments. [38] [39] [40] In the field of ADRD research, we believe it will impact most the traditional neuropsychological and functional assessments on which most primary outcomes for ADRD interventions trials are based. 41 In the long term, ADRD research will also benefit from these technological innovations because they should allow the recruitment and follow-up of much larger samples at reduced costs. Finally, the COVID-19 crisis may expedite the development of non-pharmacological interventions that can be delivered the home of participant, e.g., homebased cognitive training or physical exercise, or that use small portable devices that can be easily used in private homes, e.g., transcranial direct current stimulation and similar devices. 40",

Local impact will vary and evolve depending on specific factors, including the incidence of COVID-19, the associated death rates, the availability of resources, and the societal changes implemented to control the pandemic. These local variations combined with the heterogeneity of ADRD make simple generic recommendations ineffectual. However, awareness of this possible impact and mitigation strategies adapted to individual and local circumstances may prevent or reduce the harm of this pandemic and its consequences for persons with ADRD and their caregivers.",

This pandemic also threatens the -patients of tomorrow.\u2016 Researchers have already sounded the alarm on how the COVID-19 pandemic may affect clinical research in unprecedented ways.33,34 The consequences may be even more dire for ADRD research. Over the past two decades, ADRD has become one of the most active areas of both basic and clinical research, attracting major industry, government, and philanthropic funding in the Western world. As of March 31, 2020, a search on clinicaltrials.gov (as of March 29, 2020) using the key words -dementia\u2016 or -Alzheimer's disease\u2016 reveals 592 active studies. A recent published study of the same registry identified 156 trials (including 42 phase-3 trials) investigating 132 agents for the treatment of ADRD, and another 33 trials of 15 different devices.35 Abrupt interruption of all these research studies would not only jeopardize a crucial investment society has already made, but it could also have long lasting consequences for the field of ADRD research. At the same time, the COVID-19 pandemic could be a welcome catalyst to accelerate the adoption of innovative design and methods in clinical research,33 fundamentally changing the way participants in trials for ADRD are recruited and assessed. The rest of this section discusses whether and how ADRD clinical research can continue during the pandemic.",
