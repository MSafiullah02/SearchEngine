This decision-making is done most often in a collaborative way, hence the Collaborative Decision Making. Making collaborative decision-making can have significant benefits such as efficiency, taking into account all stakeholder proposals. However, a collaborative Decision Support System (GDSS) and the attitudes that encourage interaction and sharing are necessary to achieve these benefits. To do this, a number of approaches have been developed; most of them emphasize the need to use an automated tool. However, the use of predefined processes is essential because it allows gaining a substantial advantage of all the resources (human, technology, time, \u2026) mobilized for the decision making. An approach called Collaboration Engineering provides tools for designing collaborative processes for practitioners that can do without the intervention of a facilitator when using these processes [6].",

It is necessary that the participants in the collaboration make the effort to achieve the goal of the group.Goal is a desired state or result.Work practice is a set of actions performed repetitively to accomplish a particular organizational task.Collaborative task is one that success depends on the joint efforts of several individuals.High value task is one that brings substantial advantage to an organization or one that avoids a substantial loss by its successful completion. The practice of the task produces a high value over time for organization.Recurrent task is one that can be conducted repeatedly through a similar process each time it is executed. In other words, it indicates that a similar approach can be used each time the task is executed even with some variations in its parameters.Collaboration Process is a series of activities performed by a team for a specific purpose within a given time frame.Facilitator is someone who both designs and conducts a dynamic process that involves managing relationships, tasks and technology, as well as structuring tasks and contributing to the achievement of the outcome of collaboration process. This work is called Facilitation.Practitioner is a specialist in a task and must perform important collaborative tasks such as risk assessment or decision making as part of his or her professional duties. He executes a specific collaborative process on a recurring basis, so he does not need any facilitation skill.Collaboration Engineer is the one who designs and documents collaboration processes that can be easily transferred to a practitioner. This means that the practitioner can run a process without the help of a collaboration engineer or facilitator.ThinkLet is the smallest unit of intellectual capital needed to create a collaboration pattern.Reusability is the property of a thinkLet to be used to solve problems different from those for which they were originally created.Predictability is the property of a thinkLet, when executed as prescribed, to create similar variations in overall collaboration patterns and deliverables with a variety of teams, tasks, and conditions.Transferability expresses the degree to which people who have never created a thinkLet can learn it, remember it, and execute it successfully.\n",
