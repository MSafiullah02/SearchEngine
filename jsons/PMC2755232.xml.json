            "text": "Spongiform encephalopathy, where vacuoles develop throughout the central nervous system (CNS), can be caused by infection with the conformationally altered form of the cellular prion protein (PrPSc), retroviruses including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), murine leukemia virus (MuLV) or maedi-visna virus (MVV), and coronavirus [1], [2], [3], [4]. In humans, spongiform changes are also observed in Alzheimer's disease, diffuse Lewy body disease, Niemann\u2013Pick disease (caused by lysosomal storage defects), Leigh disease (caused by mitochondrial dysfunction) and Canavan disease (caused by aspartoacylase deficiency) [5], [6], [7]. Inherited spongiform encephalopathies develop in mutant mice homozygous for null alleles of Mahogunin Ring Finger-1 (Mgrn1), Attractin (Atrn), superoxide dismutase 2 (Sod2), Fig4, Vac14 and the Kir4.1 potassium channel subunit [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]. These genetic models provide an opportunity to gain insight into the mechanisms that underlie vacuolar changes in the CNS through the identification of the cellular role(s) of the mutated proteins. While the function of the proteins encoded by all of these genes is not known, several are known to affect mitochondrial function or endo-lysosomal trafficking.",

            "text": "The endo-lysosomal pathway plays a critical role in a variety of cellular activities including nutrient intake, signal transduction, and receptor down-regulation, recycling and degradation. Defects in endocytic trafficking are associated with numerous diseases including pigmentation, bleeding and neurodegenerative disorders [9], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24]. Transmembrane proteins are primarily internalized into cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, then delivered into early endosomes (EEs) where they are clustered and sorted into intraluminal vesicles to form multivesicular bodies (MVBs). When MVBs fuse with lysosomes, these vesicles and their contents are degraded by lysosomal enzymes. Sorting into MVBs is a critical regulatory step for many proteins and requires ubiquitination at several steps along the way [25]. Ubiquitination is a multistep process in which the small polypeptide ubiquitin is activated in an ATP-dependent manner and then covalently attached to target proteins through the concerted actions of ubiquitin activating (E1), conjugating (E2) and ligase (E3) proteins [26]. Ubiquitination is a sorting signal for many processes, such as trafficking toward the lysosome from many cellular compartments including the plasma membrane (where it promotes internalization), Golgi (where it can divert proteins to endosomes) and MVBs [reviewed by [27]].",

            "text": "Protein sorting into MVBs is regulated by endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT)-I, II and III. The sorting process is initiated by the recruitment of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (HRS, also commonly referred to as ESCRT-0) to the endosomal membrane through its FYVE domain, which binds to phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P). HRS also interacts with ubiquitinated cargos through its ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM), while a C-terminal \u201cLIEL\u201d sequence binds to clathrin. HRS recruits ESCRT-I to the sorting site via a PSAP motif, which binds to the ubiquitin E2 variant (UEV) domain of the ESCRT-I component TSG101. Ubiquitinated cargo are recognized by the UEV domain of TSG101 and the Npl4 zinc finger (N2F) domain of VPS36 in ESCRT-II. Cargo proteins are clustered by the ESCRT-III complex and their ubiquitin moieties removed by the deubiquitinating enzyme DOA4. Cargo are then sorted to the inner vesicles of MVBs and the ESCRT complexes are disassembled by the AAA-type ATPase VPS4 [28], [29], [30]. Ubiquitination and the ESCRT machinery are also involved in retroviral budding [31], [32]. Ubiquitinated GAG proteins of many viruses, including HIV, associate with TSG101 to recruit it and the ESCRT machinery to the plasma membrane, where the same processes that give rise to MVBs are used to bud virus particles out of the cell [33], [34], [35], [36].",

            "text": "Mice lacking the E3 ubiquitin ligase Mahogunin Ring Finger-1 (MGRN1) develop progressive, widespread spongiform neurodegeneration of the CNS that first becomes apparent between 9 and 12 months of age [11]. This phenotype is preceded by mitochondrial dysfunction and elevated oxidative stress [37]. Mgrn1 null mutant mice also have a defect in pigment-type switching that prevents them from producing yellow pigment [38], and aberrant patterning of the left\u2013right body axis during development that causes lethal congenital heart defects in \u223c 50% of animals [39]. As an E3 ligase, MGRN1 may target a wide variety of proteins for ubiquitination to account for the broad spectrum of phenotypes observed in null mutants, or it may target a small number of proteins that have essential roles in multiple cell types to exert its pleiotropic effects. Here, we confirm a previous report that MGRN1 associates with and ubiquitinates TSG101, a component of ESCRT-I [40], and extend the analysis by examining the in vivo consequences of loss of MGRN1. We demonstrate that ubiquitination of TSG101 in the mouse brain is regulated in part by MGRN1 and that its solubility and pattern of ubiquitination change with age in normal mice and differs between wild-type and Mgrn1 null mutant mice. We propose a model in which endocytic trafficking in general, and TSG101 in particular, plays a central role in the pathogenesis of spongiform encephalopathy in Mgrn1 null mutant mice.",

To test this hypothesis, HEK293T cells were transfected with HA-ubiquitin and either empty GFP vector, MGRN1-GFP, catalytically inactive MGRN1(AVVA)-GFP, or siRNA against Mgrn1. In the presence or absence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132, multiubiquitination of TSG101 was increased in MGRN1-GFP transfected cells relative to vector-transfected cells (which contain endogenous MGRN1) and greatly reduced in cells expressing MGRN1(AVVA)-GFP or Mgrn1 siRNA (Fig. 3A, B). A short exposure of Fig. 3A shows that more multiubiquitinated TSG101 is present in cells expressing MGRN1-GFP than GFP alone, even in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Fig. S2 in the supplementary material). Experiments using GFP-ubiquitin-K0 (in which all lysines have been mutated to alanines, rendering it incapable of forming polyubiquitin chains) in place of wild-type ubiquitin showed a similar pattern of MGRN1-dependent ubiquitination of TSG101, indicating that TSG101 is multimonoubiquitinated by MGRN1 (Fig. 3C). We confirmed that MGRN1(AVVA)-GFP was still able to associate with TSG101; in fact, TSG101 appeared to associate more strongly with MGRN1(AVVA)-GFP than with wild-type MGRN1-GFP (Fig. 3D). Catalytically inactive mutants of other E3s have also been shown to bind their target proteins more strongly [i.e., 47].",

Brain proteins from 1- and 6-month-old Mgrn1 null mutant and wild-type mice were extracted in Triton X-100 buffer and the resulting pellet extracted with SDS-containing buffer. Immunoblotting for TSG101 demonstrated that very little of the multiubiquitinated TSG101 in 1-month-old wild-type brains was soluble in Triton X-100 while a greater proportion was soluble in 6-month-old wild-type brains (Fig. 6\n). Most TSG101 in the brains of 1-month-old Mgrn1 null mutants was not ubiquitinated and was soluble in Triton X-100. There was a significant increase in soluble and insoluble TSG101 in the brains of 6-month-old Mgrn1 null mutants, with the majority of insoluble TSG101 being ubiquitinated in those samples (Fig. 6).

[40], showing that the vertebrate-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase MGRN1 binds and multimonoubiquitinates TSG101 to regulate its function in endo-lysosomal trafficking in vivo. We focused on the effect of loss of MGRN1 in the mouse brain on the regulation of TSG101, where the relationship between Mgrn1 genotype and levels of multiubiquitinated TSG101 (which was lower in homozygous null mutants than in heterozygotes) indicates that MGRN1 is responsible for ubiquitinating a significant portion of TSG101 in the brains of young (1-month-old) wild-type mice. The PSAP motif in MGRN1 that mediates its association with TSG101 is not present in invertebrate MGRN homologs, nor in the vertebrate family member MGRN2 (RNF157). This implies that the ability of MGRN1 to associate with TSG101 is a relatively recent evolutionary event and either has an important vertebrate-specific function or plays a role in vertebrate cells that is performed by another E3 ligase in non-vertebrates. We also observed age-dependent changes in the pattern of TSG101 expression in the brains of wild-type mice, with more TSG101 multiubiquitinated in the brains of young (1-month-old) animals than in adult mice. This suggests that MGRN1-dependent TSG101-mediated endocytic trafficking may be particularly important during development and that only low levels of activity are required for normal adult CNS function.",

Overexpression of MGRN1 had no effect on GAG budding and loss of MGRN1 resulted in elevated levels of EGFR. TAL-mediated ubiquitination of TSG101 increased its solubility [44]. Since the solubility of the ubiquitinated TSG101 that accumulates in the brains of Mgrn1 null mutant mice was reduced, TAL is probably not the E3 that ubiquitinates TSG101 in the brains of older animals lacking MGRN1. The fact that multiubiquitinated TSG101 accumulates in the brains of adult Mgrn1 null mutant mice indicates that it is not targeted for proteasomal degradation, while its reduced solubility suggests that it may form insoluble cytoplasmic aggregates or be membrane-bound. If the latter, multimonoubiquitination by MGRN1 may be necessary for TSG101 to complete its ESCRT-I function and subsequently be released from endosomal membranes. The increase in EGFR levels in the brains of Mgrn1 null mutant mice is consistent with MGRN1-dependent ubiquitination of TSG101 being required for its normal function in MVB sorting and receptor down-regulation.",

            "text": "While further studies will be needed to determine whether disrupted TSG101 function in fact causes the spongiform neurodegeneration observed in Mgrn1 null mutant mice, there are at least two possible mechanisms by which it could do so. The first is related to the fact that endo-lysosomal trafficking of EGFR is required for its down-regulation and degradation in the lysosome [50], [51], [52]. We observed increased levels of EGFR in the brains of Mgrn1 null mutant mice, particularly in 1-month-old animals. Lysosomal trafficking of EGFR has also been reported to be disrupted in cells in which MGRN1 was depleted by siRNA, with prolonged activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling [40]. Exposure of mixed cortical cultures (containing neurons and astrocytes) to 100 ng/ml of EGF caused neuronal death associated with features of necrosis and increased free radical generation [53]. The EGFR-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor C56 blocked the effect of excess EGF, indicating that the neurotoxicity was mediated through EGFR signaling. Thus, accumulation of activated EGFR could be responsible for (or at least contribute to) elevated levels of oxidatively damaged proteins observed in the brains of Mgrn1 null mutant mice [37] and subsequent vacuolation.",

            "text": "Another possibility is that the vacuoles in the brains of Mgrn1 null mutant mice represent accumulated endocytic compartments. Mammalian cells lacking TSG101 showed disrupted bulk transport to the lysosome as well as structural rearrangement of the early endosome to form enlarged vacuoles that were often folded into multicisternal structures reminiscent of the abnormal membranous compartments that accumulate in yeast \u201cClass E\u201d vacuolar protein sorting (vps) mutants [54], [55]. We propose that any mutation that severely disrupts endo-lysosomal trafficking would cause the accumulation of endocytic compartments that could, over time, enlarge to fill the cell. Loss-of-function mutations in Fab1 (endosomal phosphatidylinositol PtdIns(3)P 5-kinase) in Drosophila or Vac14 (a regulator of phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2) synthesis) or Fig4 (a PtdIns(3,5)P2 5-phosphatase) in mice have also been shown to disrupt endo-lysosomal trafficking and cause cellular vacuolation and spongiform neurodegeneration [9], [10], [17], [56]. Thus, defects in intracellular trafficking represent a common cellular mechanism for causing spongiform neurodegeneration. It remains to be determined whether vacuoles are the result of aberrant trafficking of and signaling by specific receptors, the accumulation of endosomal compartments, or a combination of the two.",
