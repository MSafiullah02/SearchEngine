Regarding social factors, we identified the return of indigenous people to their communities, poor access to water, language barriers, and limited access to the Internet, as factors that will not allow them to take the minimum preventive measures against the disease. Additionally, environmental risk factors associated with pollutants from biomass burning were identified. In health, the lack of coverage in these areas and comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, respiratory tract infections, and chronic pulmonary diseases were identified. Some existing government programmes were identified that could be supported to address these social, environmental and health gaps.",

Disease control efforts include counting infected cases, controlling transmission, clinical severity, research in drug treatments, and social isolation. The overall mortality rate varies between 5.5 and 5.9%, but could be as high as 20% in Wuhan where the epicenter of the outbreak occurred (Baud et al., 2020) . In Mexico the reported mortality rate is 9.7% as of June 6, 2020 (https://coronavirus.gob.mx/datos/). The World Health Organization has accomplished an excellent job in establishing the guidelines to face this pandemic, it has marked the protocols of action of the health authorities of all the countries given the magnitude of the event that goes from the most basic prevention such as constant hand washing, hygiene habits, social distancing to detection tests, patient care inside the housing, epidemiological surveillance, among many others (https://www.who.int/es/emergencies/diseases/novelcoronavirus-2019).",

In Mexico, 8 (Chiapas, Hidalgo, San Luis Potos\u00ed, Oaxaca, Yucat\u00e1n, Veracruz, Durango, and Guerrero) of the 32 entities concentrate between 66 and 85 % of the indigenous population. The largest populations are: Nahuatl, (24%); Maya, (13.7%); Mixteco, (6.8%); Zapoteco, (6.8%); Tseltal, (5.7%); Paipai, (5.5%); Otomi, (5.5%); Tsotsil, (5.1%); Totonaco (3.6%); and Mazahua (3.0%). These 10 towns of the 68 that exist in our country, concentrate 80% of the indigenous population (INPI, 2017) . These inequities are factors that will not allow the COVID-19 to be confronted in indigenous communities. Although preventive actions such as constant handwashing have worked in mainly urban contexts (WHO, 2020), the barriers to the marginalization that include limited access to piped water, soap, and drainage (the use of dry or wet toilets is common in these areas but lacks adequate maintenance arrangements), make these solutions unprovable in all indigenous communities.",

Despite the limitations that indigenous populations confront in relation to technological areas (lack of infrastructure and low purchasing power), we can consider that within the users, young people have greater access to the Internet J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f and that they have more schooling than their parents and older adults (Sunkel and Ullmann, 2019) . This is an important point in the design of intervention strategies, as we already highlighted, local indigenous communities do not often have a complete command of the main languages. The UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues recommends that to avoid communication breaks that will spread the disease, all key messages on hygiene, quarantine, and containment should be shared with traditional leaders and youth leaders and translated into local indigenous languages. Faced with this pandemic situation, the Mexican government has the program \"Youth Building the Future\" and has a census of more than 678 thousand young people between 18 and 29 years old, who during one year are linked to institutions, companies, workshops or businesses where they develop or strengthen work habits and technical skills to increase their employment opportunities in the future. This is where an opportunity is found to establish a strategy for the formation of local human capital. If only 10% of these young people were in indigenous localities, all the indigenous communities in Mexico would be covered, with training in the surveillance and prevention systems for COVID-19, support for telemedicine in strategic communities, and so could be covered even more and vulnerabilities due to lack of access to information could be reduced.",

Until 2015, 10.4% of the indigenous population was over 60 years old (INPI, 2017), but in addition 4 out of 5 older adults who speak an indigenous language are monolingual and only 18% also speak Spanish, therefore, the transmission of prevention messages, symptoms, and any intervention measure for COVID-19 disease must contemplate language to achieve effective communication. In view of this, Mexico must implement measures planned from an intercultural perspective. Among these initial efforts are the actions carried out by the National Institute of Indigenous Peoples in Mexico, which has translated information from the health sector for the prevention of COVID-19 virus infection into 35 indigenous languages, focusing on the WHO J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f The efforts to prevent and mitigate COVID-19 disease in indigenous peoples in Mexico have been the same as those implemented in the general population. They are based so far on the transmission of information, such as the \"Stay at Home\" campaign, messages about proper handwashing and hygiene measures, social distancing, among others, this in a precarious socio-economic context. In 2018, the National Council for the Evaluation of Social Development Policy stated that 11.8 million indigenous people in Mexico are in situations of poverty and extreme poverty. Social deprivation indicators show that 3.7 million are lagging in education, 1.9 million in access to health services, 9.4 million in access to social security, 3.8 million in food, 3.4 million in housing quality and space and 6.9 million in basic housing services, of which 12.8% lack piped water, 26.9% do not have sanitation services, 13.9% of homes have dirt floors and 58.8% cook with wood or charcoal (CONEVAL, 2019)",

For example, in Colombia, a Latin American country with about 2,000 of the more than 30,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the region, indigenous leaders in the mountainous department of Cauca were threatened by drug trafficking groups after they closed their borders by establishing 69 checkpoints protected by 1,200 guards (Turkewitz Julie., 2020). Some indigenous leaders in Peru decided to close their borders to people outside their communities until COVID-19 is under control (Zavaleta, 2020). COVID-19 disease could potentially have serious effects on the well-being, livelihoods, and health of all peoples. The strict public health policy measures of quarantine and isolation implemented by China in Wuhan showed a reduction in the effective number of propagation (Dandekar and Barbastathis, 2020) and 76 days later they ended the closure of their borders.
