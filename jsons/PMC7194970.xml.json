Experimental and clinical models show different responses from administration of agents interfering with this regulatory axis: angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARB) and mineralocorticoid-receptor blockers seem to increase the levels of ACE2 gene expression and cardiac ACE2 activity [38,39], whereas ACE-I are associated with elevated cardiac ACE2 activity but not cardiac ACE2 mRNA [40]. An early study documented increased cardiac ACE2 expression after myocardial infarction in rats treated with agents blocking the Ang II receptors when compared to placebo [41]. Similarly, higher urinary ACE2 levels were observed in hypertensive patients treated with olmesartan, an Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist [42]. Furthermore, administration of losartan, another AT1 receptor antagonist, counterbalanced smoke-induced decrease of ACE2 and restored to some extent the ACE/ACE2 ratio in the lung [43].",

Its positive impact in upregulating ACE2 has been demonstrated [41], suggesting a potential role against lung damage in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients [22]. However, risk of increase susceptibility to infection linked to ACE2 upregulation due to RAS inhibitors remains uncertain and needs to be clarified. Fang et al. based on higher prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus and chronic cardiovascular diseases among patients who died from COVID-19 postulated that ACE-I or ARBs might favour severe disease progression [46]. However, more recently, in a multicentre retrospective study including 1,128 COVID-19 inpatients with hypertension, the use of ACE-I/ARBs was associated with lower all-cause mortality (adjusted HR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.19\u20130.92; P = 0.03) and septic shock (adjusted HR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.16\u20130.84; P = 0.01) compared with ACE-I/ARB non-use. Unfortunately, the study was not designed to detect differences between ACE-I and ARBs and overall the patient number in ACE-I/ARB group was limited (188/1128; 16.6%) [47]. These data support the statements of European Society of Cardiology [48], American Heart Association, the Heart Failure Society of America and the American College of Cardiology [49], International Society of Hypertension [50], Italian Society of Pharmacology [51] and European Society of Hypertension [52] that recommend against ACE-I or sartans discontinuation in light of the current evidences.",
