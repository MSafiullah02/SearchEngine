While some countries are starting to bring their epidemic outbreaks under control, evidence on the effectiveness of current lockdowns is only now starting to come into focus (5, [27] [28] [29] . In Wuhan, China, the growth rate of the cases decreased after the implementation of a large-scale lockdown which included travel restrictions, quarantine and social distancing measures like closing of schools (27, 30) . In Huangshi the epidemic curve became flattened 9 days after a lockdown was implemented (27) . Nevertheless, the most adequate strategy for implementing a lockdown (scale and timing) is still a matter of controversy (31) . Interestingly, our study adds to the literature that small-areas lockdowns could also contribute as secondary measures for controlling the outbreak.

Individual voluntary quarantine decisions resulting from the increasing awareness are likely to have an effect on this outcome, but probably varying substantially depending on material circumstances and other socioeconomic considerations.

While this can dilute the intervention effect, it seems adequate given that mobility in major cities occurs between different municipalities. Moreover, policy effects are expected to impact disease transmission on a larger scale and not only in the small area directly affected by the lockdown. Secondly, our main outcome (Re) is subject to biases due to underreporting or different testing capacity between regions, urban mobility indicators are not. Even so, the consistency of the results over mobility indicators, not affected by such bias, and the case transmission reinforce our conclusions. Third, our small-area lockdowns effect estimates could be underestimated due to the impact of previously implemented policies. Reducing mobility even more after archiving already low levels of movement is probably difficult. Fourth, our assessment of school and university closures is based on a before and after model, no control was available since all regions implemented the intervention on the same date. Therefore, it is not possible to disentangle the effects over mobility produced by school closures and other concomitant factors such as increasing awareness and observed effects cannot be entirely attributed to the closures measure.

If these conditions are not fulfilled, such a strategy is prone to fail. Since this is a short-term evaluation, it is still to be seen if such social distancing approach can be maintained and show sustained effectiveness in the mid-term to keep the epidemic curve under control. Based on the response seen in Chile, lifting school closures too early could produce an increase in urban mobility that could impact on disease transmission. Therefore, any action in this direction needs to be carefully planned to mitigate the risk of an outbreak rebound. .

(3,4) By then, many countries had implemented large-scale subnational lockdowns (e.g. Wuhan, Lombardy). (5,6) On March 15th, the Chilean government ordered the mandatory closure of schools, followed by the announcement of voluntary university closures and reorganization for remote instruction. (7) On March 18th, the Chilean government declared a 90-day State of Emergency, enabling exceptional measures to limit certain rights or constitutional guarantees such as free transit. Starting March 19th, the government ordered the closure of all the country's shopping centers. (8) The Chilean Medical Association and several other leading organizations urged the government for stronger measures and called for the population to stay at home (9). With this and the active coverage of mass media, the urgency of the COVID-19 pandemic became more evident to the population, increasing broader awareness. In the following weeks, the Government implemented several additional public health interventions, including a ban on mass gatherings and an overnight curfew starting on March 22nd, among others. Furthermore, this prompted the application of a teleworking regime in most offices with the capacity for remote operations.",

In green lines and dots the average mobility for each indicator on nonintervention areas (controls) is presented. Red dotted vertical lines represent the time of implementation of small area lockdowns within cities or municipalities (Santiago, Temuco, Chill\u00e1n, Osorno, Punta Arenas, and parts of Bio Bio). In gray vertical line is presented end date for Bio Bio lockdown. Y-axis represents percentage changes in mobility. Note that important changes in mobility are observable on the Eastern weekend (April 10 to 12).",
