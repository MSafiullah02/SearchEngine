[2] categorized orthopaedic conditions requiring emergency surgery into three groups depending on the need for (1) urgent operative intervention, (2) early surgery during the next available semi-elective list with necessary sub-specialty expertise, or (3) conditions that rarely come to harm if operated on after a few days. While most fractures, mangled limbs, neurovascular injuries, compartment syndromes, and severe infections will still require urgent surgery, more procedures may now be performed in a delayed ambulatory setting without compromising patient care due to advances in technology and improved understanding of biology. Massey et al. recommended that most fracture fixations should be performed within two weeks of index injury [3], while DePhillipo recommended a list of acute surgically necessary soft-tissue injuries that should be operated on as elective-urgent procedures in the outpatient setting without guidance on critical timings [4]. As recommendations for time to surgery for sub-acute orthopaedic soft-tissue conditions are currently guided by expert opinions and historical perspectives, this paper aims to further assist surgeons by outlining surgical timings based on a review of the literature as summarized in Table 1.",

Delaying surgery to two to four weeks after injury allows time for reduction in swelling and interval capsular healing while still allowing for direct repair of bony avulsions or mid-substance collateral ligament ruptures [35]. Differences between early (< 2 weeks) and late (> 6 months) surgery were small in the early phases of recovery but were ultimately not statistically significant at long-term follow-up of two to eight years [36, 37].",

Care of such patients is also complicated by bulky orthoses and increased manpower for daily tasks due to the need to maintain spinal nursing. The National Trauma Data Bank found that the majority of patients with spinal fractures underwent operative fixation within three days, with these patients having less complications (skin breakdown, acute respiratory distress syndrome, venous thromboembolism, progression of neurological insult, pneumonia, urinary tract infection) and requiring less resources [62\u201364]. These findings were replicated in patients who sustained polytrauma [65] and should be prioritized before the management of other long bone and peri-articular fractures in these patients. Various spinal colleges throughout the world have different guidelines for timing of surgery, and a universally accepted algorithm remains elusive for the time being. While surgical timings remain controversial, the recommendation seems to be for hospitalization of the patient for expedited surgery and to proceed when surgical expertise and an operating list become available.",

For acute traumatic injuries in the ambulatory surgery setting, better outcomes appear to be associated with early surgery for subluxations (< 1 week), recurrent dislocations (> 2 episodes), ligamentous and tendinous injuries (< 2 weeks), and bony avulsion injuries (< 3 weeks). Spinal conditions with neurological compromise should be operated on within 24 hours, and spinal instability within 72 hours. These patients should be hospitalized for serial reviews and expedition of surgery instead.",
