Ten years later, humans were found to be infected with these influenza viruses [2]. A novel human influenza A (H1N1) virus caused a worldwide respiratory disease outbreak in April 2009. The major transmission route for influenza virus is via respiratory droplets released while coughing [3], [4], [5]. Influenza virus replicates in the epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract, which destroys the host cells, further spreading to infect other cells. The clinical manifestations of influenza are fever, headache, myalgia, fatigue, rhinorrhea, sore throat, and cough. The impact of influenza outbreaks is much higher in children than in adults. Most healthy adults will recover after 3\u20137 days [6], [7], [8]. Influenza A/H3N2 was the predominant serotype during the 2010\u20132011 season, whereas the A/H1N1 2009 virus still cocirculated with the A/H3N2 and influenza B strains [9]. The pandemic influenza A/H1N1 outbreak resulted in over 18,449 deaths in over 214 countries until 2012 [10], [11].",

            "text": "Conventional diagnostic testing of influenza virus included virus incubation and nucleic acid amplification test. Virus incubation is the first method used to diagnose virus infections, while it takes about 7 days to amplify the virus in the host cells. A nucleic acid amplification test is the most sensitive method to detect virus infection, but pretreatment of the sample, including virus isolation and nucleic extraction, still requires about 1 day. The above methods are not suitable for the rapid screening of influenza virus [12]. In vitro diagnostic devices (IVDs) play crucial roles in disease diagnosis because of their rapid and convenient properties. Diagnostic accuracy of IVDs is dependent on their sensitivity and specificity. A previous study evaluated the 3M rapid detection test for the respiratory syncytial virus, and found the sensitivity and specificity of the device to be 74% and 100%, respectively [13]. In April 2011, a study conducted by Iregbu et al [14] on the performance of Dual Path Platform testing kits revealed a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 99.5%. By contrast, a study by Shrivastava et al [15] reported that the commercial Dengue NS1 antigen kit had a sensitivity of 26% against 91 clinical samples. Few studies have reported the sensitivity of influenza IVDs (Flu-IVDs) in detecting influenza A. These previous studies used four commercialized rapid test kits [16], [17], [18], [19], [20].",

As shown in Table 3\n, seven products of three Flu-IVD licenses (A\u2013C) that were manufactured in the USA and Spain used HA concentrations as their sensitivity label. The analytical sensitivity of these Flu-IVDs against A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and Flu B was 500\u20131000 ng/mL, 1000 ng/mL, and 1000 ng/mL, respectively. For A/H1N1 detection, products A and B displayed higher analytical sensitivity than product C. The sensitivity results for A/H3N2 and Flu B were identical in these samples. We obtained seven products from three domestic Flu-IVDs (D\u2013F) and 17 products from eight Flu-IVDs (G\u2013N) imported from China, the UK, Finland, Singapore, USA, and Korea with CCID50 labels. In the past 5 years, type A/Taiwan/439/2009 (H3N2) and type A/Taiwan/9042/2008 (H1N1) were the two main strains of influenza outbreak in Taiwan. Hence, these two virus strains were used as influenza viral particle standards for CCID50 test [22]. The averages of A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 sensitivity were log10 5.8 \u00b1 0.5 CCID50/mL and log10 6.6 \u00b1 0.5 CCID50/mL, respectively. In Fig. 1\n, the unbroken, broken, and dotted lines represent the mean, mean \u00b1 1 standard deviation (SD) and mean \u00b1 2 SD in the sensitivity tests, respectively. For A/H1N1, the sensitivity of all products was within mean \u00b1 1 SD (Fig. 1A). As to A/H3N2 sensitivity, however, the products E, I, L, and M fell into the mean \u00b1 2 SD range (Fig. 1B). Seven products from five imported Flu-IVDs did not have test sensitivity labeling. Therefore, HA concentrations were used to determine their sensitivities. In Table 4\n, the sensitivities of these seven samples against H1N1, H3N2, and Flu B were 500\u20131000 ng/mL, 500\u20133250 ng/mL, and 1000\u20136750 ng/mL, respectively.",

            "text": "We assumed that one of the reasons for the discrepancies was that the human epidemic strains of influenza viruses used in the Flu-IVDs did not match the current influenza virus outbreak strains. Pandemic influenza virus strains varied from year to year and from country to country. For example, the influenza A/Texas/1/77 strain was used as the master influenza virus strain to develop the monoclonal antibodies in the BinaxNow Influenza A&B Rapid Test; however, the major virus strain that caused the influenza outbreak in Taiwan was the type A/Taiwan/439/2009 (H3N2) and type A/Taiwan/9042/2008 (H1N1). Other Flu-IVDs failed to mention the master influenza virus strain used in their preparations. Therefore, inappropriate master influenza virus strains used in the Flu-IVD preparations may contribute to the low detection sensitivity. Moreover, studies have shown that analytical sensitivity did not directly reflect the clinical sensitivity on patient specimens. The analytical sensitivity of influenza H5N1 detection and seasonal influenza was the same, although their clinical performances were poor [23], [24]. Manufacturers should follow WHO recommendations for the annually pandemic influenza virus strains to be used in their preparation of the Flu-IVDs in order to improve the quality. We also suggest that the class level for Flu-IVDs in Taiwan for government regulations be elevated so that the government can monitor the quality of IVDs using a lot release system. Furthermore, Taiwan FDA should establish a reference or proficiency panel to evaluate in vitro Flu-IVDs in the near future.",

Viruses such as influenza virus, coronavirus, and respiratory syncytial virus commonly cause respiratory tract infections [25]. Several studies have conducted a specificity test by real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis for different respiratory-tract-infection-related viruses [26], [27]. The specificity of Flu-IVDs played an important role in the selective interaction of influenza A and B viruses. According to the epidemiological studies, HCoV caused >15% of common colds in adults, of which OC43 was the most common [28]. Hence, we used the common HCoV-OC43 to determine the specificity of Flu-IVDs in this study and the result showed that not all Flu-IVDs cross-reacted with HCoV-OC43, suggesting good specificity (Table 5\n).",
