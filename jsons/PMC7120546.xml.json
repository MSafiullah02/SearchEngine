            "text": "Regardless of the age of the recipient, a thorough medical, surgical, and psychosocial history needs to be obtained, along with a detailed physical examination. Careful examination of the abdomen for previous operations is important, as is the presence or absence of peripheral arterial pulses. Initial laboratory testing includes blood type, HLA typing and a panel reactive antibody assay to detect for previous sensitization, complete blood count (CBC), blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, electrolytes, calcium, phosphorous, albumin, liver function tests, prothrombin time, and partial thromboplastin time. Serologic studies for cytomegalovirus (CMV), hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV, HCV), human T cell leukemia virus (HTLV-1), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are routine. One element of the evaluation process includes baseline age-appropriate screening tests. It is also important and appropriate to maintain a higher index of suspicion for malignancy in patients of this age group. In women, this consists of gynecologic examination and Papanicolaou smear, breast examination, and in those over the age of 40 without a family history of breast cancer in the premenopausal years, mammography. In men, testicular examination, prostate examination, and for those over age 50, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) assay should be performed. All patients over the age of 50 should undergo screening colonoscopy. A screening purified protein derivative (PPD) test may be used depending on the patient population and patient history. Radiologic studies include chest X-ray and electrocardiogram as routine and can include ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen to evaluate anatomy if indicated. Estimation of urine output preoperatively is important because it determines the significance of postoperative urine output and helps determine the need for any urologic evaluation. A history of claudication warrants a workup for peripheral vascular disease and may also point towards a higher chance of ischemic heart disease. The presence of strong femoral and peripheral pulses indicates that the pelvic vessels will likely be adequate for the transplant vascular anastomosis. Assessment of cardiac risk is critical in the evaluation process of elderly patients. Cardiovascular disorders, such as hypertension, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and arrhythmias are common in elderly transplant recipients and account for most of the deaths in this population. Blood pressure, blood \u00adglucose, and cholesterol control is of particular concern because this patient population frequently have or develop these complications. The prevalence of ischemic heart disease is very high in patients with end-stage renal disease, and almost half of the deaths that occur during the first 30 days posttransplant are due to ischemic heart disease [15]. The current guidelines from the American Society of Transplantation recommend assessing ischemic heart disease risk factors in any patient with a prior history, men over the age of 45 or women over the age of 55 years, cardiac disease in a first-degree relative, current cigarette smoking, diabetes, hypertension, fasting total cholesterol  >  200 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol < 35 mg/dL, and left ventricular hypertrophy. Any patient at high risk, including those with renal disease from diabetes, prior history of ischemic heart disease, or more than two of the above risk factors, should undergo an echocardiogram and cardiac stress test. Angiography with possible revascularization, if indicated, should be performed prior to any transplantation. Asymptomatic patients can also undergo noninvasive tests first that may help determine the risk for posttransplant complications, in the form of chemical stress echocardiography or scintography [15].",

The concern is that malignancies are common after transplantation, possibly due to immunosuppression favoring the growth of malignant cells and/or viral infection. This part is addressed in a later section on postoperative issues. While it has been reported that patients with ESRD on dialysis have a higher rate of cancer compared to the general population, this relative risk has been shown to be higher in younger patients [18]. Most patients previously treated for cancer benefit from a waiting period prior to renal transplantation to decrease the risk of recurrence. Depending on tumor characteristics, recommendations range from no wait time to 5 years. No waiting time is required for basal cell carcinoma of the skin, in situ cancer of the bladder or cervix. A 2-year waiting time is proposed for lymphoma, leukemia, cancers of the prostate, lung, breast (early stage), testicle, thyroid, uterine body, bladder, Wilm\u2019s tumor, renal cell carcinoma (<5 cm), or Kaposi\u2019s or other sarcoma. Patients with localized, successfully treated carcinoma of the uterine cervix may benefit from waiting 2 years, and in some cases 5 years, prior to transplantation. A 5-year waiting time is recommended for colorectal, invasive breast, and renal cell carcinoma (>5 cm), and malignant melanoma [15, 16, 19].",

The low-risk recipient of a kidney from a young donor may be a candidate for rapid steroid withdrawal or steroid minimization strategies due to the lower risk of rejection and increased risk of steroid-induced adverse effects. The low-risk recipient of a kidney from an older donor may have an enhanced risk of chronic allograft nephropathy and nephrotoxicity from the calcineurin inhibitors, so it may be appropriate to use a calcineurin inhibitor minimization strategy. As already mentioned, interleukin-2 receptor antibodies or antilymphocyte antibodies may be used as induction agents with a calcineurin inhibitor, with the interleukin-2 receptor antibody showing a superior safety profile.

Overimmunosuppression will increase infectious complications in all patients, regardless of age. However, the elderly are less immunocompetent, leading them to be more susceptible to infection at lower levels of immunosuppressive therapy. Most likely to contribute to this are high-dose corticosteroids and antilymphocyte antibodies at induction. Other causes of death in the elderly recipient include malignancy and gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Death due to malignancy has been reported to increase disproportionately with time after transplantation in the elderly recipient [22]. Despite the mortality risks, there is still a better life expectancy and quality of life afforded by kidney transplantation compared to dialysis. With careful selection and responsible follow-up, advanced age alone is not a contraindication to successful transplantation.

It does not, however, necessarily correlate with posttransplant survival [45].",

The cardiovascular workup for patients over the age of 60 years includes a routine history and physical examination, EKG, and two-dimensional echocardiography. A history of coronary artery disease (CAD) or symptoms of exceptional angina are clear indications for performing cardiac catheterization prior to transplantation. A negative stress test is not sufficient to exclude cardiac disease in patients with clinical history strongly suggestive of CAD. In this situation, the clinician may elect to proceed directly to cardiac catheterization [47]. Doppler studies of the carotid, vertebral, and peripheral limb arteries are performed on these patients if clinically warranted. Revascularization strategy must be performed prior to listing for liver transplantation if there is extensive coronary heart disease [38]. Diabetes mellitus may be the most important risk factor for the presence of CAD in patients with liver disease and must be assessed and managed \u00adappropriately in the perioperative setting [44, 48]. Older patients with end-stage liver disease, particularly those with cholestatic liver disease, are also at risk for osteopenia or osteoporosis. Postoperative corticosteroid therapy will also contribute to bone loss, increasing the risk of sustaining compression fractures. For all elderly patients, determination of vitamin D serum levels and baseline bone densitometry is encouraged [44]. Any patient over the age of 60 with a history of encephalopathy, seizures, or ischemic event should have an MRI of the brain prior to being listed. Older patients also have to be routinely screened for malignancy. Patients waiting for liver transplants need to be evaluated for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in particular, as well as for colon, skin, prostate, and breast neoplasms.",

One of the larger studies investigated the impact of age in living-donor liver transplantation by following recipients over 60 years of age over a 10-year period. They found the following parameters as risk factors influencing survival rate in patients after LDLT: MELD score equal to or greater than 25; Child\u2019s classification C; preoperative status of the recipient being in an intensive care unit; and blood type incompatibility. Recipient age of 60 years of age or older had no influence on the survival. 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival of the recipients older than 60 years were 81.9, 78.7, and 78.7%, respectively. Interestingly, their results in older patients were better than in younger patients (1-, 3-, and 5-year survivals in patients younger than 60 years is 75, 70.8, and 69.3%, respectively). A possible explanation for this better survival is that the selection criteria of older recipients were more stringent. The MELD score for older group recipients was significantly lower, and high-risk older patients were not considered for LDLT as a treatment option for their advanced liver disease in that study [43].",

The Clinical Practice Committee of the American Society of Transplantation published recommendations in 2001 for considering heart transplantation in patients with cardiac conditions that have not responded to maximal medical management [13]. Although severe heart failure refractory to medical therapy is the most common indication for transplantation, other circumstances warranting transplant include severely limiting ischemia not amenable to interventional or surgical revascularization, recurrent symptomatic ventricular tachyarrhythmia refractory to medical therapy, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), or surgery and rarely, for the management of cardiac tumors. Nonischemic cardiomyopathy accounts for approximately 45% of cases, and coronary artery disease accounts for about 38% of cases. Nonischemic conditions include systolic heart failure, defined by left ventricular \u00adejection fraction  <  35% (Ischemic and dilated \u00adcardiomyopathy, \u00advalvular heart disease, and hypertensive heart disease); intractable arrhythmia uncontrolled with implantable cardioverter-\u00addefibrillator; and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with persistent heart failure despite valve replacement, pacemaker, or medical therapy.",

The prognosis of HIV has changed since the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), and guidelines are being amended so that HIV infection itself is not a sufficient reason to refuse heart transplantation [68]. Age greater than 70 years was an absolute contraindication in previous guidelines, but the ISHLT has recently modified their recommendations in 2006 to state that \u201ccarefully selected patients  >  70 years of age may be considered for cardiac transplantation.

It is not delineated if this survival advantage is related to the underlying patient characteristics or choice of operation. The impact of underlying diagnosis on survival after lung transplantation has often been linked to age, with older recipients having a significantly shorter survival than younger ones. Recipients with COPD have the best 1-year survival, but a lower 10-year survival when compared to those with cystic fibrosis and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. In contrast, patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension have the lowest 1-year survival, but their 10-year survival approaches those with cystic fibrosis and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency [87].\n",

This trend is mirrored in the transplantation population. The discipline of organ transplantation has grown remarkably over the last half-century and has evolved from infrequent, highly dangerous procedures with very high mortality to complex operations performed regularly across the country and world. Data from centers across the country clearly indicate that patients over the age of 65 can undergo kidney, liver, heart, or lung transplantation with excellent results (Fig. 98.7). The limiting factor, however, is the shortage of organs and excess of patients on the waiting list; which raises many ethical and social concerns regarding transplanting healthy organs into older patients who may not have as much of a survival benefit as a younger patient. Although the allocation of organs according to age may be a simple approach to satisfying the goal of social justice, the inclusion of patient comorbidity and potential for survival benefit in the elderly must also be considered.\n",

The results depend on the selectivity used to identify those elderly candidates on the waiting list for transplant. Cardiac and lung transplants have shown some promising results in patients over the age of 65, but not over the age of 70. It is important to note that with cardiac and lung transplantation, there is a slight discrepancy with the proportion of elderly patients on the waiting list and with overall survival rates. This is likely due to patient selection more than the overall results. This patient population is a highly selective group of elderly patients with cardiac and lung disease, who are often not placed on the waiting list until they worsen clinically. All things being equal, discrimination against older candidates for organ transplantation on age-related grounds alone is not warranted. Despite potential utilitarian gains to be made limiting transplantation in the elderly \u00adrecipients, the sense of fairness in the system will be harmed. Elderly patients who are healthy will be the ones who suffer. Older patients already face huge hurdles to get on the waiting list for transplantation, and they are already such a small number. There already is enough discrimination against the elderly, and we ought not to add to that injustice by further limiting their access.",
