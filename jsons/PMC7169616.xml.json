In the United States, an HP H5N2 AIV epidemic resulted in depopulations of more than 30.7 million birds in 15 affected states between 2014 and 2015.6 Moreover, pandemic human influenza is at high risk due to the continuing mutations of the avian origin AIVs.5, 7 Therefore, it is critically urgent to develop fast and sensitive methods to closely monitor the presence of the AIV in vulnerable host population and quickly detect it during the early stage of the infection,3, 5 so that immediate prevention and control procedures can be adopted to prevent virus spread and disease outbreaks. In this work, AIV was used as the diagnostic target, although the platform itself is applicable to all pathogens with available antibodies.",

Silicon pillars etched by hydrofluoric acid with the aid of Ag+ are commonly used for bioassays, such as circulating tumor cell enrichment,46, 47 virus capture,48 and bacterial detection.49 However, the substrate for silicon pillars is not transparent, which limits its applications in the biosensor platforms that use optical detection. ZnO is a semiconductor material and is widely applied in energy harvesting and conversion.50, 51 The controllable growth of the semitransparent ZnO nanostructures (ZnO nanowires or nanorods) directly on glass substrate is more feasible for biosensors based on optical detection. Previous reports suggest that ZnO nanostructures can enhance the biomolecular fluorescence intensity.52, 53 We hypothesize that the high surface\u2010to\u2010volume ratio and intensified fluorescence of the ZnO nanostructure can significantly improve the sensitivity of the immunoassays for pathogen detection. Furthermore, the integration of the nanomaterials into microfluidic chips not only provides the capability for pathogen capture and detection but also enables portable multiplex pathogen assays by spatial encoding. In this paper, we report a new ZnO nanorods integrated microchip (ZnO\u2010NIM) that captures AIV on immunologically functionalized ZnO nanorod surface and detect viruses by multiplexed sandwich immunoassay. To improve the interaction on the ZnO nanorod surface, herringbone structures were incorporated inside the microfluidic device for enhanced mixing.54, 55 Highly selective detection of H5N2 subtype AIV is achieved by fast continuous flow in the microfluidic channels that effectively minimizes nonspecific adsorption.2, 29, 56 The entire detection process could be completed within 1.5 h, while the limit of detection (LOD) for the H5N2 AIV was measured as 3.6 \u00d7 103 EID50 mL\u22121. This platform shows the capability for simultaneous detection of multiple viral pathogens by spatial encoding different antibodies onto the same ZnO\u2010NIM. Moreover, we further demonstrated the captured H5N2 AIV could be released by simply dissolving the ZnO nanorods in acidic environment and the released H5N2 AIV could be detected by the real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR (rRT\u2010PCR). The successful virus release enables subsequent off\u2010chip analyses of the captured viruses by ZnO\u2010NIM, which complements to the on\u2010chip multiplexed sandwich immunoassay and greatly expands its capability.",

Although the ZnO nanorod slides are translucent, they provide a better surface for fluorescence detection compared with bare glass slides. The fluorescence enhancement property of the semitransparent ZnO nanostructured glass substrate helps to boost up the overall detection sensitivity (Section S4, Figure S4, Supporting Information) by 70% for 100 nm fluorescent beads and 30% for fluorophores. The effect is purely optical and caused by neither larger surface area nor more fluorophores. It agrees with previous reports on the fluorescence enhancement effect randomly aligned ZnO nanorods, which is better than the vertical growth ZnO nanowires.60, 61 Interfacial electron transfer and evanescence waveguide of the ZnO nanostructures may attribute to the fluorescence enhancement effect we observed.62, 63\n",

Details on the design and fabrication of the device are described in the Experimental Section and Section S1 (Supporting Information) (Figures S1 and S2, Supporting Information). The ZnO\u2010NIM adopts regular hexagon geometry for multiplexed detection of a maximum of six pathogens. Each side of the hexagon corresponds to one potential pathogen. Before the immunoassays, different capture monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are conjugated to the ZnO nanorod surface on different hexagonal sides of the ZnO\u2010NIM. First loading reagents and the sample, the target pathogens can be captured on the mAb\u2010ZnO surface of one or multiple branched channels (Figure 2B). After washing with buffer, the interfering pathogens and contaminants are washed out of the device by the continuous high\u2010speed flow. The herringbone structure in the ZnO\u2010NIM increases the liquid mixing thus enhances the chances of interactions between the target pathogen and the mAb on the ZnO surface. After pathogen capture, biotin\u2010labeled detection monoclonal antibodies (detection mAb\u2010biotin) are loaded into the ZnO\u2010NIM device and allowed to react with the captured pathogen to generate the sandwich immune complexes (Figure 2C). Fluorescence signal is generated using cyanine dye\u2010conjugated streptavidin (Cy3\u2010SA) by utilizing the high affinity between biotin and streptavidin5, 65 (dissociation constant on the order of \u224810\u221214\nm).

After ZnO\u2010NIM fabrication, surface modification was performed in situ inside the microfluidic channels by flowing in various solutions. The nanostructured ZnO nanorod surface was first treated with (3\u2010glycidyloxypropyl)trimethoxysilane (GPTMS) to obtain the epoxy groups that can react with the \u2014NH2, \u2014SH, or \u2014OH group at different pH conditions. After the GPTMS modification, the adsorption band for hydroxyl group around 3376 cm\u22121 in the FT\u2010IR spectrum disappeared, suggesting the successful modification with epoxysilane (Section S5, Figure S5, Supporting Information). Then the H5 mAb was conjugated to the GPTMS\u2010modified ZnO nanorod surfaces through epoxy ring\u2010opening reaction. Unreacted epoxy groups on the ZnO nanorod surfaces were blocked with the methoxy polyethylene glycol thiol (mPEG\u2013SH) and the bovine serum albumin (BSA). Figure 3B,C provides SEM images of the ZnO nanorods on the glass slides after modification of the H5 mAb for H5N2 AIV. The H5 mAb\u2010modified area on the ZnO slide was darker than unmodified area that lies outside of the microfluidic channel with the same imaging process and condition (Figure 3B), which implied the H5 mAb were conjugated onto the ZnO nanorods. As it is well known that ZnO nanoparticles or ZnO nanorods can dissolve at the acidic condition, the stability of ZnO nanorods on the microfluidic channel should be characterized after the modification of H5 mAb. The morphology of H5 mAb modified ZnO nanorods remained the same after surface modification as the pure ZnO nanorods, which confirmed that the ZnO nanorods were stable during the neutral pH condition of H5 mAb modification. Surface functionalization with other capture antibodies follows the same procedure.",

First, ZnO\u2010nanostructured glass slides and bare glass slides were H5 mAb modified with or without the covalent linker GPTMS. Then DyLight\u2010conjugated goat antimouse IgG was used to react with the primary H5 mAb. Fluorescence images were recorded under exactly the same conditions and analyzed to evaluate the performance of H5 mAb surface modification. As shown in Figure\n\n4\n, after the DyLight\u2010conjugated goat antimouse IgG reacted with the H5 mAb, the fluorescence intensities of the bare glass slides, GPTMS\u2010modified glass slides, ZnO\u2010nanostructured glass slides, and GPTMS\u2010modified ZnO nanostructured glass slides were 6170 \u00b1 158, 12 852 \u00b1 787, 51 110 \u00b1 3456, and 58 966 \u00b1 2060 (A.U.), respectively.

The ZnO nanorods significantly increase fluorescence signal intensity. It is worth to note that, even without the GMPTS modification, the ZnO slides show a high fluorescence after incubated with the H5 mAb overnight. The statistical significance between the H5 mAb conjugation on the GMPTS\u2010modified ZnO and that on unmodified ZnO (p value = 0.0382) is much lower than that of others (p values < 0.001, Figure 4), indicating the physical adsorption of the H5 mAb dominates the enhanced antibody surface modification on the ZnO nanorod surface. Although the more specific chemical adsorption mediated by GMPTS seems to play a minor role, the GMPTS\u2010modified ZnO slide shows higher and more stable fluorescence intensity than that of the ZnO nanorods without the GMPTS modification. Therefore, we use the GPTMS\u2010modified ZnO nanorod glass slides for the subsequent virus detection.",

To test the specificity of our ZnO\u2010NIM for the H5N2 AIV, we tested seven samples including one negative control of allantoic fluid (AF), one target H5N2 AIV, three nontarget AIV subtypes of H1N1, H3N2, and H7N2, and two other viruses of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) and Nebraska\u2010calf\u2010diarrhea virus (NCDV). As shown in Figure\n\n5\n, the fluorescence intensities from the detection of the negative AF control and five nontarget virus samples were all around 4900 (A.U). For the target H5N2 AIV of 3.6 \u00d7 106 EID50 mL\u22121, the fluorescence intensity increased to 52 013 (A.U.), which was tenfold higher than that of the negative AF control and nontarget virus samples. The high specificity of this method for the H5N2 AIV could be attributed to the high specificity of H5 mAb for the H5N2 AIV,7 minimized nonspecific interactions on the ZnO nanorod surfaces due to BSA and mPEG\u2010SH blocking, and the continuous washing under high flow rate (120 \u00b5L min\u22121). Previous reports suggest continuous washing at a high flow velocity is more efficient to remove the nonspecific adsorptive substances than the fixed volume bath method.2, 29, 56\n",

The H5N2 AIVs were cultured in embryonated chicken eggs and the concentration of the AIVs was calculated to 3.6 \u00d7 106 EID mL\u22121 as our previous report.28 Serial dilutions of H5N2 AIV samples were prepared for final virus titers of 3.6 \u00d7 102, 3.6 \u00d7 103, 3.6 \u00d7 104, 1.8 \u00d7 105, 3.6 \u00d7 105, and 3.6 \u00d7 106 EID50 mL\u22121. Viruses were detected inside ZnO\u2010NIM by sandwich immunoassay using H5 specific mAb for H5N2 AIV. The fluorescence images of on\u2010chip H5N2 AIV detection with different virus concentrations are shown in Figure\n\n6\nA\u2013H. As summarized in the dose\u2013response curve of Figure 6I, the fluorescence intensity increased as the virus concentration increased. The negative AF control from healthy chicken showed negligible fluorescence, even though it was a complex sample itself. Although the fluorescence intensity for 3.6 \u00d7 102 EID50 mL\u22121 of the H5N2 AIV sample is slightly higher than the negative AF control, based on the criteria that fluorescence intensity needs to be at least threefold of the standard deviation higher than that of the negative control,29 the LOD for the sandwich immune assay implemented in ZnO\u2010NIM for H5N2 AIV is determined as 3.6 \u00d7 103 EID50 mL\u22121. Therefore, the H5N2 AIV sample above this concentration can be statistically detectable by our method that does not implement any signal amplification strategy. Our results show that the sandwich immunoassay implemented in the ZnO\u2010NIM is \u224822 times more sensitive than the conventional sandwich ELISA method for the H5N2 AIV using the same H5 mAb (Section S6, Figure S6, Supporting Information). There are several reasons for the high sensitivity of this ZnO\u2010nanostructure\u2010based immunoassay platform. First, compared to flat bare glass surface, the 3D ZnO nanorods modified surface has more binding sites for the mAbs. Second, the diffusion distance between the surface and species in the flow (virus samples, mAb, and other reagents) is decreased. Compared to previous reports, our biosensor shows a higher or at the same range of the sensitivity without any signal amplification and good specificity (Section S9, Table S1, Supporting Information). The high sensitivity could partially be attributed to the enhanced fluorescence by ZnO nanorods. Furthermore, we believe that ZnO\u2010NIM can be used for other biosensing applications such as superbugs, nucleic acids, proteins, and other microorganisms with available reagents. Although the fluorescence enhancement and semitransparency benefit fluorescence detection on ZnO nanostructured glass device, the ZnO\u2010NIM itself is not limited by fluorescence detection and can be potentially used with other detection methods.22, 30, 65\n",

This concept is demonstrated in Figure\n\n7\nA, where food dye solutions with various colors were introduced to different microfluidic branch channels of a ZnO\u2010NIM. We performed simultaneous detection of two AIV subtypes (H5N2 and H7N2) in a single ZnO\u2010NIM (Figure 7B). As summarized in Figure 7C, the branched channels I, II, and III were modified with the H5 mAb specific for H5N2 AIV and the branched channels IV, V, and VI were modified with the H7 mAb specific for H7N2 AIV. After washing with phosphate buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST), the branched channels I and VI were loaded with PBS without virus, while H5N2 and H7N2 AIVs were introduced to branched channels II, IV and branched channels III, V, respectively. After incubation and washing, a mixture of H5 mAb\u2010biotin and H7 mAb\u2010biotin was loaded into all the branched microchannels to generate sandwich immune complexes. Followed by additional washing, secondary labeling reagent Cy3\u2010SA was then loaded and reacted with the biotin on the primary mAb. The results showed that only branched microchannels that had matching capture mAb and virus subtype (e.g., channel II: H5 mAb and H5N2 AIV sample; channel V: H7 mAb and H7N2 AIV sample) presented strong fluorescence. This proof\u2010of\u2010concept experiment suggests that our method has a good specificity for complicated scenario of simultaneous detection of multiple pathogens. With the advantages of multiplexed detection, high sensitivity, and high specificity, the ZnO\u2010NIM provides a promising portable tool for diagnosis of viral infectious diseases.",

The captured H5N2 AIV in ZnO\u2010NIM were incubated with PBS (pH 6.0) and the viruses in the collected solution were measured by the real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR to confirm that the viruses could be successfully released from ZnO\u2010NIM. After incubation with low pH buffer solution, the ZnO nanorods disappeared under the microscope (Figure\n\n8\nA,B) and the microfluidic channel became more transparent than before, which indicated that the H5N2 AIV was probably released from ZnO\u2010NIM under this acidic environment. The rRT\u2010PCR results confirmed that the releasing solution contained H5N2 AIV in all three experimental groups with the mean cycle threshold (Ct) value of \u224828, while the negative control experiment generated no positive signal (Figure 8C). At 25 \u00b0C, ZnO dissolves in acidic buffer with pH lower than 6.7 and becomes Zn2+.68 With this unique property of ZnO, the captured targets can be released from ZnO\u2010NIM. This significantly expands the usability of the platform well beyond the ELISA demonstrated in this current work. For emerging viruses, the released viruses can be isolated and cultured. Furthermore, the virus titer can be quantified by more sensitive molecular assay like the rRT\u2010PCR. More importantly, the whole genomes of released viruses can be determined by various next\u2010generation sequencing (NGS) methods for studies important for viral pathogenesis, adaptability and genetic diversity of viruses, and epidemiology and transmission dynamics during disease outbreaks. Furthermore, the ZnO nanorods integrated microdevice is easily fabricated, cheap, and disposable. The ZnO\u2010NIM might be regenerated by using complex chemical method, such as DNA strand displacement,69 which needs the DNA modified on the surface and the DNA conjugated antibodies. In this paper, we proved that the 3D nanostructured surfaces could be integrated into the microfluidic chips for highly sensitive pathogen detection. The composing elements of the 3D nanostructured surfaces are not only limited to the ZnO nanorods, but also other nanomaterials, such as TiO2,44 which can be self\u2010cleaned by UV treatment and regenerated by simple method. This nanostructured surface based on TiO2 might be used in microfluidics for pathogen detection in the future. On the other hand, in this paper, we show a simple method by changing the pH to release the capture pathogens.",

The ZnO nanorods are synthesized on the KMnO4 activated glass slides in a low\u2010cost and scalable batch process that does not depend on cleanroom facilities. We implemented a multiplex ELISA assay on ZnO\u2010NIM. We can detect H5N2 AIV at virus concentration as low as 3.6 \u00d7 103 EID50 mL\u22121 using ZnO\u2010NIM, which is \u224822\u2010fold more sensitive compared with conventional ELISA. This high sensitivity could be attributed to more conjugation sites on rough 3D ZnO nanorod surface and the reduction of the diffusion distance between mAb\u2010ZnO and pathogens. In addition, although the glass substrate becomes semitransparent after ZnO nanorod growth, the rough nanostructure does not interfere with fluorescence detection, yet enhances it optically by 30%\u201370%. Although immunoassays in general have lower sensitivity than molecular assays like rRT\u2010PCR, their flexibility, portability, and low price still make them a preferred method in many practical applications for pathogen detection. The specificity of ZnO\u2010NIM was validated by distinguishing the target virus from negative AF sample and several samples containing nontarget viruses. Furthermore, by conjugating different mAb on different branched microchannels of the same ZnO\u2010NIM, the device can be used for multiplexed detection of pathogens in complex samples. By dissolving the ZnO nanorods at a slightly acidic buffer (pH 6.0), the captured H5N2 AIV can be released and recovered for the subsequent analyses. This sensitive, selective, multiplex portable technology and the integrated fluorescence sandwich immunoassay can be expanded to detect other pathogens and disease biomarkers.",
