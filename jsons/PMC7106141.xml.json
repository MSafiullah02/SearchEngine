Overseas travel has since recovered and 17.535 million international trips were made in 2006, the highest ever in Japanese history apart from in 2000 when 17.819 million travelers were recorded. A significant proportion of travelers visit areas of risk for malaria, yet our previous studies have shown protection against malaria to be suboptimal in Japanese travelers.1, 2, 3\n",

However, a high proportion of users report adverse drug events, with a predominance of neuropsychiatric adverse events among mefloquine users.4 The benefits of chemoprophylaxis use to prevent malaria need to be carefully weighed against the risk of adverse drug events. This is particularly pertinent for travelers from Japan where mefloquine is the only drug licensed for malaria prophylaxis. Country-specific information on the incidence of malaria in travelers provides the most reliable data on which to base the pre-travel risk assessment. Some such studies have been conducted among Western travelers; however, to our knowledge, there have been no reports on Japanese travelers.",

These data can be used to determine malaria risk in travelers, adjusting for the duration of exposure and the use of chemoprophylaxis.

The British13, 14 and Swedish15 studies estimated travel volume to a specific country/area using passenger surveys conducted at international airports and telephone interviews, respectively. These approaches benefited from larger sample sizes (numerator and denominator data) and greater diagnostic accuracy of malaria, as the infections were confirmed after returning home. However, illnesses that occurred abroad are not captured, and the effect of length of stay may not be evaluated due to lack of data. Furthermore, the incidence rates could be greatly influenced by chemoprophylaxis use in high-risk groups, and this could not be assessed in these studies.",

It is also noted that our country-specific rates were generally lower than those obtained for Western travelers; rates in Japanese travelers to Nigeria and Ghana were several to 10-fold less than those of British,13 Italian,10 and Danish11 travelers. Recently, however, Steffen et al.16 showed the 10-fold decreased malaria incidence rate among travelers to Tropical Africa (200 per 100,000 per month of stay) than previously reported, some of whom were on chemoprophylaxis. Our current results are rather comparable to those new data. The low incidence rate in Kenya was unexpected and far lower than that of British travelers (8.0 per 100,000 compared with 149 per 100,000)13 or Danish travelers (245.9 per 100,000),11 although it was similar to the rate reported among Italian travelers (9.0 per 100,000).10 This may be because Japanese travelers tend to visit safari parks which may pose a lower risk than visits to coastal areas such as Mombassa. In fact, visits to game parks in Kenya were found to be 4.7-fold lower risk than visits to the coast and 14.3-fold lower risk than to Lake Victoria.8\n",

The British study also showed a very high rate in Oceania (4100 per 100,000), with most cases occurring after visits to Papua New Guinea.13 In addition, the Australian study reported even a greater risk in the Solomon Islands than Papua New Guinea.9 In our study, however, we could not accurately assess the risk in the Solomon Islands as denominator data were only available for three of the study years. Based on these data, an estimated 1600 travelers visited this country during the study period and six malaria cases (two P. falciparum, four P. vivax infections) were reported, giving an incidence rate of 375.0 per 100,000 travelers. We found that 70% of malaria cases acquired in Papua New Guinea were due to P. vivax, with 27% due to P. falciparum. Even if considering the lower proportion of P. falciparum infections, chemoprophylaxis may be recommended for travelers to this region of Oceania, as long as it is recommended for travel to sub-Saharan Africa.",

Limited prescribing of malaria chemoprophylaxis for travelers to the Indian Subcontinent17 and Latin America18 has been proposed by European groups, because of the low incidence of malaria and low risk of travelers acquiring P. falciparum infection. Our study results provide support for this recommendation. Although previous studies have shown that among Asian countries, the risk of malaria is high in India and the Indian Subcontinent,9, 10, 12, 13, 15 our study showed the highest risk in Myanmar, which may have not been previously documented. Similar to previous studies,9, 11, 12 the risk of malaria in Thailand was lower than in Indonesia, both being Asian countries attracting an enormous number of tourists worldwide.",
