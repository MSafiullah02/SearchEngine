However, we urge the medical community that the tracking of outcomes of non-COVID-19 patients is equally important to better inform us of not only the mortality rates of COVID-19 but also its collateral damage because of patients' reluctance to seek care, or the absence of otherwise routine care. The use of digital-health technologies should be employed to longitudinally track patients initially scheduled for elective surgery. For example, the inclusion of real-time tracking for cardiac mortality would result in a realtime impact of decision making: i.e., if mortality from CVD dramatically increases, a corrective course may be developed in real-time.",

            "text": "Wave: Long-Term Post-COVID-19 Impact and Beyond Education and training. As cardiothoracic surgical cases are cancelled and trainees are redeployed to areas of need, surgical trainees will increasingly find themselves with the challenge of balacing service and education. Some institutions are alternating residents and changing rotational structure. Coupled with a dramatic reduction in elective case volume, training opportunities are greatly diminished. Moreover, large and intermediate group didactic and process improvement meetings are routinely being cancelled. Since training in cardiothoracic surgery is over such a short amount of timeranging from a minimum of two years via fellowship to a minimum of six years via integrated programs--the long-term impact of multiple lost months may be substantial. As healthcare workers are redeployed to care for COVID-19 patients, and resources such as ventilators and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation devices are utilized to stabilize critically-ill COVID-19 patients, the capacity to treat CVD and emergencies remains critically limited. The decision to subject cardiovascular patients to surgery is difficult yet fluid, and with limited evidence-based guidelines as illustrated by the spectrum of CVD. While hemodynamically unstable patients are quickly moved to the operating room if pharmacological and non-invasive care has failed, the timing to intervene on clinically stable patients may not be as clear. In the context of heart transplants, United Network for Organ Sharing status 1 to 3 patients ought to be prioritized wherever possible, whilst those of lower 5 status are left in the dark. 4 Newborns with single ventricles or prostaglandin-dependence should clearly be managed, but what about children with valve insufficiency or large septal defects? Healthcare professionals are increasingly faced with important ethical dilemmas that are unique to the traditionally high-resource settings they have been operating in. The Society of Thoracic Surgeons has provided important ethical guidelines and tiered triage guidance statements for cardiac surgery, congenital heart surgery, and thoracic malignancies. 3,5-7 Furthermore, they have also developed important resource utilization prediction tools based on data from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Database to assist healthcare providers in making informed decisions regarding resource allocation and triage of patients.",

Initial examples have been set by the Cardiothoracic Surgery Network (CTSNet) and Canadian Cardiovascular Society-developing guidelines and townhalls--and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons-launching its Resource Utilization Tool for Cardiac Surgery and virtual COVID-19 resource portal-and can be supplemented by clear guidelines such as the joint consensus statement on thoracic malignancies from the Thoracic Surgery Outcomes Research Network, The Society of Thoracic Surgeons, and the American Association for Thoracic Surgery. 7,9 Comprehensive consensus statements and guidelines that provide further guidance in the management of all cardiothoracic surgical diseases in each stage of the surge of COVID-19 are needed and can help alleviate the COVID-19 burden wherever possible. 7. The integrity of surgical training and the sustainability of the workforce should be maintained. Trainee wellness and safety should be priorty. In addition, restructuring of workflow and adaptation of educational milestones can help minimize disruption to surgical training. 10 E-technology can help provide continuity in academic and simulation curricula as well as allow flexibility in interviews and licensing 8 examinations. However, such virtual education platforms will require rapid adoption by programs and growing understanding and familiarity by both trainees and faculty.",
