Evasion strategy is used mainly by RNA viruses, and is based on high mutation rates and quasispecies dynamics. The complexity of viral populations demands research on new antiviral strategies that take into consideration the adaptive potential of viruses, in particular RNA viruses.",

The process can be imagined in simplified terms. Viruses and other agents of horizontal gene transfer (conjugative plasmids, mobile elements, etc.) contributed to cellular diversification, and possibly also to functional compartmentalization. In turn, viruses acquired specific functions to target subsets of cells. Viruses that killed cells massively would not survive. Cells that were totally resistant to viruses would be deficient in one of the several mechanisms that permit their exploration of new biological properties through genetic change. The result of eons of these interactive processes is a number of mechanisms evolved by viruses to overcome host defences and of hosts to limit the actions of molecular parasites. Dramatically, this evolutionary history is responsible for difficulties we encounter in virus disease prevention and control.",

These immunomodulatory products include homologues of cytokines, chemokines and their receptors, as well as some that can modulate signal transduction, inhibit apoptosis, the activity of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), natural killer (NK) cells, complement, antibody production or down-regulate major histocompatibility complex proteins, among other activities (Alcami, 2003; Seet et al., 2003; Campo, 2002) . Interaction strategies extend to some DNA viruses of small genome size, such as the papillomaviruses, and even to some RNA viruses. The important human pathogen hepatitis C virus appears to exploit both interaction and evasion strategies to survive as one of the most successful viral pathogens worldwide (Isaguliants, 2003) . By analysing the molecular basis of such interactive mechanisms much can be learned not only of viral infections but also of the host immune system.",

The molecular basis of this adaptive strategy is the high rate of occurrence of mutations during RNA genome replication (Batschelet, Domingo and Weissmann, 1976; Drake and Holland, 1999) . This is due largely to the absence of proofreading-repair activities that are usually associated with cellular DNA polymerases, and also to the absence of postreplicative mismatch correction pathways that can act on double stranded DNA but not on RNA. The result of these critical biochemical differences is that viral RNA replicases and retrotranscriptases display average error rates in the range of 10 -3 to 10 -5 misincorporations per nucleotide copied (Drake and Holland, 1999) while for cellular DNA polymerases involved in DNA replication average rates are around 10 -10 misincorporations per nucleotide copied (Alberts et al., 2002) .",

Therefore, RNA virus populations consist of complex and dynamic distributions of mutant genomes, termed viral quasispecies (Eigen, 1996; Eigen and Biebricher, 1988) . Multiple quasispecies co-exist in infected organisms, even within individual tissues and organs. Quasispecies was developed as a general theory of molecular evolution (Eigen and Schuster, 1979) , and it has had a major impact for virology (Domingo, 2000; Domingo et al., 2001) . Here, only those features are emphasized related to the evasion strategy of RNA viruses (and, according to recent evidence, also some DNA viruses of small genome size (L\u00f3pez-Bueno, Mateu and Almendral, 2003)) that represent a problem for disease prevention and control. In the mutant distributions of viral quasispecies, antibody-or CTL-escape mutants may be present or be generated with high frequency. Their selection may result in progression of infection despite an immune response, and may limit the efficacy of vaccines and other immunotherapeutical treatments. Likewise, inhibitor-escape mutants may be present or generated in mutant spectra, and their selection may result in failure of antiviral treatments. This has been reviewed by Domingo (2003) .",

More generally, mutants with increased virulence, altered host cell tropism or altered host range may be present or generated in mutant spectra. Their selection may result in more severe disease, or in disease with atypical symptoms, or in viral disease emergence or re-emergence. This has been reviewed by Baranowski et al. (2003) .

In principle, monotherapy, with either a single antiviral inhibitor or a single monoclonal antibody, is incompatible with the dynamics of rapid mutant generation, competition and selection in viral populations. This is because inhibitor-or antibody-escape mutants are likely to be rapidly selected . The frequent (in some case systematic) selection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) mutants resistant to antiretroviral agents constitutes a dramatic example. It is remarkable that the mutations that confer resistance to inhibitors have always been compatible with viral function. If resistance mutations entailed lethality, the problem of treatment failure would not occur. The author has speculated that, in their long evolutionary history, viral enzymes had to cope with metabolites that are related to the currently used inhibitors, and that they had to evolve to overcome inhibitory (or other perturbing) effects (Domingo, 2003) . According to this proposal, there would be deep evolutionary determinants involved in the current difficulties encountered in suppressing viral replication, in addition to viruses using part of the cellular machinery to complete their replication cycles.",

The key issue here is to make such effective vaccines available to people in need of health care, worldwide. Vaccine efficacy should not impede awareness that even these viruses that can now be controlled harbour enormous potential for genetic change and for causing forms of disease that cannot be anticipated. We know this from experience with the emergence of HIV-1, SARS virus and many other pathogens over the last decades. It is extremely important to view viral pathogens (and in reality any microbial pathogen) as a highly dynamic and flexible entity in its fine genetic identity as well as in its manifestations of an infection (Holland, de La Torre and Steinhauer, 1992) . New approaches to treat and prevent viral diseases must be found that take into consideration (rather than ignore) the highly dynamic nature of the pathogens to be controlled.",
