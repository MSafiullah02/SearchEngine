When BHK-21 cells are infected with simian virus (SV)-5 extensive cell fusion with subsequent disintegration of the syncytia occurs but only small amounts of infectious virus are released. In contrast, the infection of rhesus monkey kidney (MK) cells with SV-5 leads to high virus titers. However, despite the large production of infectious virus only little cell destruction is induced and the MK cells continue to multiply almost unimpaired (Holmes and Choppin, 1966) . Marked differences in the interactions with various types of host cells have also been described for Newcastle disease (NDV) (Alexander et al., 1973; Hecht and Summers, 1974) and influenza virus (Klenk et al., 1975; Lazarowitz and Choppin, 1975) where the failure of host cell dependent cleavage of viral glycoproteins may lead to persistently infected cells in which viral maturation to a pathogenic form does not take place (Holland and Levine, 1978) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 624, "end": 650, "text": "(Holmes and Choppin, 1966)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 778, "end": 802, "text": "(Alexander et al., 1973;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 803, "end": 827, "text": "Hecht and Summers, 1974)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 848, "end": 868, "text": "(Klenk et al., 1975;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 869, "end": 898, "text": "Lazarowitz and Choppin, 1975)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1079, "end": 1105, "text": "(Holland and Levine, 1978)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Cell-Specific Factors"}, {"text": "b.

Genetically Resistant Cells. Although it is well established that the resistance of cell lines to oncornaviruses is genetically controlled (Jolicoeur, 1978) the role of genetically resistant cells in other viruscell systems is less clear. Many cell lines carry latent viruses or viral genomes (Chipmanet al., 1969; Weiss et al., 1971) . Therefore, in persistently infeded cells, it is often difficult to discriminate between genetically controlled resistance and unresponsiveness due to inapparent virus infection. The development of increased resistance (due to host cell mutants?) was frequently observed in cell cultures persistently infected with enteroviruses ( Vogt and Dulbecco, 1958; Takemoto and Habel, 1959; Pasca, 1961; Walker et al., 1966) . However, experiments with other viruses (e.g., paramyxoviruses) indicate that genetically resistant cells may not be a major factor in controlling persistent infections in cell cultures (Rima and Martin, 1976) . d. Interferon. Interferon can usually be detected in persistently infected cells in the initial stage of infection, which, in some virus-cell systems, is characterized by a cyclic rise and fall of virus titers. Wiktor and Clark (1972) showed in mammalian and reptilian cells infected with rabies virus, and Inglot et al. (1973) with Sindbis virus-infected mouse cells that this pattern of rising and falling levels of viral infection is probably mediated by interferon. In contrast, no interferon was found in HeLa cells or human lung cells persistently infected with measles virus (Rustigan, 1966; Norrby, 1967) or in other cell lines persistently infected with different viruses (Walker and Hinze, 1962; Fernandes et al., 1964; Desmyter et al., 1968; Kawai et at., 1975) .

Defective Interfering Virus Particles. Defective interfering (DI) virus particles, which have been found in many preparations of DNA and RNA viruses, are characterized by the following properties: They (1) possess an incomplete genome, (2) contain the same structural proteins a8 infectious virus, (3) replicate only in the presence of helper virus, and (4) interfere specifically with the replication of homologous infectious virus (Huang and Baltimore, 1970; Huang, 1973 Huang, , 1977 . Holland and Villareal (1974) showed that in BHK-21 cells persistently infected with VSV, infectious virus free from DI particles will cause a lytic infection while an infection with DI particles and infectious virus will usually result in persistence of the virus. Thus, DI particles obviously play a role in the initiation and maintenance of persistent infections in cell cultures; but-analogous to ts mutants-the molecular control mechanisms, mediated by DI particles in persistently infected cells, are still obscure. DI particles of VSV containing covalently linked, complementary RNA are potent inducers of interferon and therefore might act in a similar way to ts mutants (Marcus and Sekellick, 1977; Sekellik and Marcus, 1978) . Holland and Villareal (1974) found a depression of translational activity of cells coinfected with DI particles and infectious virus.

Effect of Amantadine Hydrochloride, Ammonium Pentatungstodiantimonate, and L-Asparaginase on Acute and Persistent LCM Virus Infections"}, {"text": "In the foot pad response ammonium pentatungstodiantimonate was inactive after intravenous as well as intramuscular application (Streissle, 1977) . In contrast, L-asparaginase caused a significant reduction of the paw swelling (Fig. 5) . The swelling started in untreated controls on day 7 and reached its peak on day 10 or 11 pi. After intramuscular injection of 10,000 IU of L-asparaginase at the site of infection (3 hours before, 24 and 48 hours after infection) no swelling was noticed until day 8 or 9 pi. However, a few days after the treatment had been terminated a weak swelling dependent on the concentration of the virus inoculum occurred. The effect of L-asparaginase on the foot pad response is dose-dependent and has also been observed after intraveneous treatment.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 127, "end": 144, "text": "(Streissle, 1977)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 226, "end": 234, "text": "(Fig. 5)", "ref_id": "FIGREF6"}], "section": "L-Asparaginuse on the Foot Pad Response"}, {"text": "The activity of L-asparaginase which has been observed in the acute, intracerebral infection and in the foot pad response is obviously caused by its immunosuppressive activities (Maral et al., 1970) since no antiviral effects were recognized either in the cell culture test or in persistently infected mice. The mode of action of ammonium pentatungstodiantimonate remains, however, obscure. In addition to antiviral activity the compound possesses cytotoxic and possibly im- munosuppressive activities (Jasmin et al., 1974) . The effect on the acute LCM may, therefore, be related to its antiviral or perhaps to its immunosuppressive effects which could also act synergistically. The results of Werner et al. (1976) are interesting in this respect since they showed that EMC virus-infected mice could be protected by ammonium pentatungstodiantimonate from a lethal encephalomyelitis despite the fact that treated mice had conparable virus titers in their blood and brain as the untreated controls. The observation that none of the compounds inhibited LCM virus multiplication in persistently infected mice cannot be conclusively interpreted. It seems unlikely that changes of the virus are responsible for these negative results since virus isolated from persistently infected mice is in uitro equally susceptible to treatment with ammonium pentatungstodiantimonate as the standard virus. It rather appears that the persistent LCM virus infection is so well established in the mouse that even with those compounds which are active in other test models no reduction of virus production could be achieved.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 178, "end": 198, "text": "(Maral et al., 1970)", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 513, "end": 523, "text": "al., 1974)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 709, "end": 715, "text": "(1976)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "L-Asparaginuse on the Foot Pad Response"}, {"text": "Cells persistently infected with HSV could be cured of the virus infection when these cells were treated with two different antiviral compounds.

In this complex virus multiplication and cell metabolism are so intimately linked that any inhibition of virus multiplication without injury to the host cell is difficult to achieve (Whitley and Alford, 1978) .
