Several studies offer additional insight into person-to-person transmission.4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 However, substantial knowledge gaps remain regarding the transmissibility between humans, including the level of exposure to a confirmed case at which transmission is more likely to occur.",

We found 34 articles, of which 13 were primary reports of person-to-person transmission. None provided full details of the contact investigation and none were from North America.\nAdded value of this study\nWe detail prolonged, unprotected contact between a travel-related index case who was symptomatic and her husband, who subsequently acquired infection. This represents the first known person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the USA. We also detail a thorough contact investigation related to these cases. We identified, risk-stratified, and actively monitored almost 350 contacts of both cases. 43 contacts developed symptoms of fever, cough, or shortness of breath in the 14 days following their last exposure to either case and were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and 32 asymptomatic health-care professional contacts who had exposures across a range of risk levels were also tested for SARS-CoV-2. All 75 tested negative.\nImplications of all the available evidence\nPerson-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurred between two people with prolonged, unprotected exposure. No further transmission was detected, despite monitoring contacts for symptoms and testing all who developed fever, cough, or shortness of breath and testing a convenience sample of asymptomatic health-care professional contacts. Further detailed reports of contact investigations associated with cases of SARS-CoV-2 could improve understanding of the transmissibility of this novel virus.\n",

Transmission occurred between close household contacts, from an index travel-associated case who subsequently transmitted the infection to her husband. Their prolonged, unprotected close contact occurred across multiple days early in her illness, before Patient 1 sought clinical care. No additional cases of COVID-19 were identified through active symptom monitoring of several hundred community and health-care personnel contacts, testing of symptomatic PUIs, or screening of a subset of asymptomatic health-care personnel contacts. These data suggest that person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 might be most likely to occur through unprotected, prolonged exposure to a patient with symptomatic COVID-19. Our experience of limited transmission of SARS-CoV-2 differs from that documented in Wuhan, where transmission has been reported to occur across the wider community and in health-care personnel,6 and from experiences of other similar coronaviruses.17, 18, 19 The severity of illness, the extent of viral shedding, and timing of exposures to a symptomatic patient might all have contributed to the limited transmission described here. Infection control measures within the hospital setting and an aggressive public health response might also have prevented further exposures.",

Second, this investigation might not have identified all individuals with potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2, because epidemiological investigations are dependent on individuals' recall of places visited, people seen, and symptom onset. The date of symptom onset for Patient 2 was especially difficult to ascertain. Given this uncertainty, we applied a conservative approach for identifying contacts of Patient 2 by using the earliest reported date of possible symptom onset, DOI 3.

For example, we considered nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimen collection aerosol-generating procedures, and therefore classified health-care personnel performing these without all recommended PPE as high risk, whereas they are classified as medium risk according to the guidance. Additionally, we included community members as contacts if they entered the same indoor environment (eg, hospital waiting room) within 2 h of a patient with COVID-19, an approach based on other viruses with airborne transmission patterns, such as measles. Current interim guidance requires contacts to have been in the room at the same time as a patient with COVID-19.

Future serological studies of exposed contacts will allow a better understanding of asymptomatic infection rates.
