            "text": "The prognosis of ALF depends on age, etiology, and the time course over which the disease evolves. In the most severe cases the mortality of ALF without transplantation ranges from 10 to 90%; in recent years, survival has improved to around 40-90% [ 3 ] . This is related to improved critical care management, better prognostic assessment, and the timely prioritisation of patients for liver transplantation (LT). The management of ALF is focused on the support of all organ systems and the prevention and treatment of complications, particularly sepsis. Liver necrosis acts as a focus of in fl ammation, driving vasoplegia and leading to cardiovascular collapse, which exacerbates dysfunction of other vital organs, particularly the kidney and brain. The identi fi cation and treatment of the cause of the underlying liver injury should be the primary goal, with a concurrent focus on the optimization of the circulation to promote hepatocellular regeneration and to prevent further insult due to ischemic injury. However, despite such endeavours timely recognition that hepatic regeneration will ultimately not be suf fi cient is crucial. Liver transplantation with removal of the necrotic liver mass offers the best chance of survival. The decision to prioritise for transplantation requires a multidisciplinary team approach incorporating specialist liver transplant surgeons, hepatologist, and intensivists who can utilize established prognostic criteria along with the daily assessment of the levels of organ support to best determine which patients are likely to bene fi t from being listed for transplant with high priority and indeed proceeding to OLT if levels of organ support permit ( Fig. 2. 2 ) [ 4 ] .",

The two most commonly used de fi nitions concentrate on the time period from jaundice to the onset of encephalopathy [ 1 ] . This classi fi cation is important, because the hyperacute forms of ALF including acetominophen overdose and Hepatitis A are associated with mortality due to cerebral edema and kidney injury. However survival without transplantation for this group is superior to the more indolent subacute causes, including seronegative and idiosyncratic drug reactions that are not as frequently complicated by the cerebral and renal insults, but carry a higher mortality burden compared with hyperacute causes ( ",

In 1998 the Medicine Control Agency in the UK sought to limit the availability of paracetamol. Legislation was changed in line with World Health Organisation recommendations and data from other countries with similar restrictive policies that had lower rates of paracetamol-induced hepatoxicity. Suicidal or parasuicidal actions are usually impulsive acts in reaction to crises; therefore, it was postulated that limiting supply would result in reduced availability of paracetamol, thus reducing the quantity ingested and lowering rates of hepatoxicity. The general sale of paracetamol was restricted to 16 500 mg tablets, a total of 8 g per packet. Studies have sought to demonstrate whether these restrictions have indeed been associated with a reduction in admissions to hospital and liver units, and in the need for liver transplantation. However, both short follow up periods and a diverse range of outcomes evaluated have hampered these studies in quantifying any change with certainty. Despite this, there is a trend towards an overall reduction of paracetamol-related hepatoxicity and hospital admissions following the change in legislation [ 6 ] .",

Due to a combination of the small doses absorbed and the ef fi cacy of early antidote therapy, only [ 8 ] , while US poisons centre data have reported rates of 35% and 65%, respectively [ 9 ] . Additionally, paracetamol medications combined with narcotics have been shown to pose a potential for unintentional hepatoxicity when addiction to the narcotic within such combined analgesics leads to a gradual increase of the ingested dose [ 2 ] . There has been the suggestion that this is a signi fi cant reason for the discrepancy between the US and the UK with regard to deliberate and unintentional overdose. The assessment of the risk of developing ALF from POD, whether accidental or deliberate, is closely related to the total dose ingested, as well as the time from ingestion to presentation and treatment with N -acetylcysteine (NAC). The pathophysiological reasons behind this relate to the length of time exposed to the active unstable paracetamol metabolite, N -acetyl p -benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). NAPQI depletes hepatic glutathione levels, with ensuing hepatocellular damage, unless the antidote, glutathione precursor NAC or methionine is given in a timely fashion. NAC acts to augment the glutathione reserves in the body, which directly bind to toxic metabolites and protect hepatocytes in the liver from NAPQI toxicity. When administered within 12 h of an unstaggered ingestion of paracetamol, NAC can prevent hepatocellular damage.",

The remainder of DILI cases are idiosyncratic reaction, which occur in around 1 in 10,000 of exposed patients. However, more than 1,000 drugs and herbal remedies have been implicated in DILI and altogether comprise 10% of ALF cases [ 13 ] .

There are nonallergic and allergic idiosyncratic DILI, the latter characterised by fever, skin reactions, eosinophilia with the formation of autoantibodies, one such example is drug-related eosinophilic syndrome (DRESS).

A literature review in 2005 cited 34 cases of primary and metastatic neoplastic in fi ltration of the liver resulting in ALF [ 15 ] . The pathophysiology of ALF in neoplastic in fi ltration is multifactorial. Parenchymal ischemia and infarction can be caused by diffuse tumour cell in fi ltration or vascular occlusion from tumour thrombi. It has also been postulated that diffuse tumour cell in fi ltration renders the remaining liver parenchyma highly susceptible to ischemic injury. A case series of three patients with metastatic disease demonstrated biopsy-proven hepatic ischemia, which was in the absence of any discernable episode of systemic hypotension [ 15, 16 ] . Additionally, cytokine-mediated liver injury has been implicated in lymphomatous in fi ltration [ 17 ] . Clinical suspicion and features suggestive of malignancy such as enlarged lymph nodes on physical examination along with computer tomography (CT) fi ndings suggestive of an in fi ltrative process should prompt an attempt to obtain a biopsy for a de fi nitive histological diagnosis. Furthermore, radiological imaging including both ultrasonography and triple phase computer tomography should not be relied on due to the poor sensitivity for metastatic and lymphomatous in fi ltration of the liver. The only serum markers of tumour in fi ltration are alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and aspartate and alanine aminotransferase (AST), though elevation of these is usually below levels seen in ischemic hepatitis. Both appear to have greater sensitivity in the presence of hyperbilirubinemia. However, jaundice does not always manifest in the setting of tumour in fi ltration with cases of over 90% liver in fi ltration without jaundice in the literature. A trans-jugular liver, bone marrow aspiration, and trephine or lymph node biopsy can all prove to be invaluable tools for establishing a diagnosis. The diagnosis of malignancy is a clear contraindication for liver transplantation and establishing the diagnosis therefore crucial.",

The incidence of WD is around 1 in 30,000 and can present acutely, usually in pediatric or young female patients, or chronically in adult patients sometimes into their eighth decade of life. ALF in WD is unique in so far as there is usually some degree of preexisting liver disease at the time when ALF ensues. WD is diagnosed by measuring indices of copper metabolism, although in ALF these investigations can be misleadingly normal. Serum copper and caeruloplasmin, as an acute phase protein, can both be normal or elevated in other causes of ALF. Elevated levels of urinary copper are a good indicator of WD, but the high incidence of anuric acute kidney injury in ALF can extinguish the availability of this diagnostic tool. Ophthalmic interrogation of corneas can be useful to detect the presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings, which together with evidence of liver disease and copper metabolism abnormalities strongly support the case for the diagnosis. Additionally, Coomb's negative hemolytic anemia and low serum cholinesterase levels can be a feature of WD [ 20 ] . The ALP/bilirubin and aspartate AST/bilirubin ratios are often signi fi cantly lower in fulminant Wilson's disease than in other categories of fulminant liver failure, but distinction between diagnostic categories on this basis is not possible [ 21 ] .",

Investigations should include those for: hepatitis and atypical viral serology; autoantibodies, such as antinuclear, anti smooth muscle, anti-liver kidney microsomal, anti-soluble liver antigen, antimitochondrial antibodies; an illicit drugs screen, paracetamol levels; and urine and serum copper. A negative paracetamol level does not rule out paracetamol as a cause of ALF. Additionally, ultrasonography of the liver and its vasculature is important. Where possible, if the history and investigations do not suggest a viral or druginduced insult, axial imaging with computer tomography is advisable. Patient outcomes are largely determined by the severity of the underly-ing liver insult and the development of organ failure and episodes of sepsis have a strong impact on mortality. Early recognition and treatment of sepsis and the prevention and support of organ dysfunction is therefore key to increasing the potential for hepatic regeneration. Finally, a timely decision regarding super-urgent liver transplantation is required when it becomes suf fi ciently clear that hepatic regeneration will not occur. This decision carries particular importance given that the median time from listing to transplantation is around 48 h. Consequently, 24% of patients listed will fail to proceed to transplantation with 92% of these patients dying [ 22 ] . Those that are not transplanted have a median time from listing to death of 2 days (2-4), with several pre-transplant factors associated with poor outcomes such as age <45 and escalating vasopressor requirement [ 22 ] . There are several other factors that should prompt discussion regarding the suitability to proceed to transplantation. These include fi xed dilated pupils for greater than 2 h, necrotizing pancreatitis, severe adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension, culture proven bacterial or fungal sepsis requiring more than 24 h of antimicrobial therapy before transplantation.

The early use of hemodynamic monitoring is recommended as it often forms a vital aspect of management providing important additional clinical indices about central circulating volumes and cardiac output.

Hyperlactemia broadly re fl ects liver, circulatory and cellular dysfunction, although the liver does have large reserves for lactate metabolism. The normal lactate levels encountered after hepatectomy with more than 50% of the liver resected supports this [ 23 ] . However, high circulating blood lactate levels are frequently encountered in ALF where inadequate fl uid resuscitation has lead to circulatory and cellular metabolism dysfunction. Overall hyperlactemia and the speed of resolution acts as an important predictor of outcome in both critical illness and ALF [ 24 ] . It is now recognised as an important prognostic variable.

The diagnosis and treatment of RAI in critical illness was fi rst encountered in sepsis with the demonstration that low dose hydrocortisone could accelerate the reversal of shock, despite a lack of signi fi cant mortality bene fi t [ 29 ] . The high prevalence of RAI in ALF can be explained by factors that affect cortisol metabolism. Firstly, both ALF and sepsis often coexist and ALF represents an additional stress that can lead to RAI. Secondly, patients with ALF have low circulating cortisol levels for several reasons: the effects of low levels of HDL cholesterol that is central to cortisol production, increased conversion of cortisol to the inactive form cortisone and the negative effect of cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a ) on hypothalamic function all contribute to the low circulating TC levels [ 30 ] .",

It is largely related to the fall in both albumin and cortisol-binding globulin (CBG), which leads to increases in free cortisol levels (FC), despite low measured TC level implying RAI. Therefore, to improve interpretation various alternative measures or calculations have been explored to better assess FC levels. The use of salivary cortisol has been shown to correlate well with FC, although in ventilated patients this may be dif fi cult to obtain. Alternatively, the free cortisol index (see equation below) can be calculated by measuring both CBG and TC levels, which has also been shown to correlate well with FC levels [ 31 ] . These alternative measures of FC may prove to be better methods of assessing RAI rather than relying on TC levels alone. However, hydrocortisone therapy is frequently initiated empirically after a short synacthen test has been performed to impact on escalating vasopressor levels.

It affects primarily those with signi fi cant vasopressor requirements and evidence of intracranial hypertension (ICH). The mechanisms involved of ALI in ALF include the directly toxic effects of acetominophen and the pathophysiological overlap of changes involving vasoactive mediators that affect not only the brain and circulation, but also the lung with increased vascular permeability and capillary leak. This is further exacerbated by the additional fl uid accumulation within extravascular compartments, due to large cumulative volumes of fl uid administered to support the vasoplegic circulation. Additionally, there is a high incidence (around 51%) of cultured tracheal aspirates with gram-negative organisms in intubated ALF patients [ 34 ] , which has a direct impact on the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia and ALI. Hepatic encephalopathy and ICH are also implicated in the development of ALI. The risk of pulmonary and extrapulmonary sepsis and indeed ARDS are speci fi cally associated with aspects of ICH management. These include deep sedation, induction and maintenance of hypothermia and limited endotrachial suction, which all contribute to limited tracheobronchial toilet and retention of secretions. In ALF commonly encountered respiratory complication associated with both mechanical ventilation and critical illness have been described.

A balanced approach is often required, though low tidal volumes (6-8 mL/kg) can achieve normal partial pressures of CO 2 (pCO 2 ) in most cases. Increased IAP and decreased lung compliance due to chest wall edema lead to increases in pleural pressure, rendering the plateau pressure a poor measure of transpulmonary pressure. Therefore, attempts to limit plateau pressure below 30 cm water can be dif fi cult to attain and indeed are often unnecessary. The combination of ALI/ARDS with severely elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) with intact physiological autoregulation necessitates tight control of pCO 2 . When all conventional measures aimed at increasing CO 2 clearance have been exhausted extracorporeal CO 2 clearance devices to facilitate control in pCO 2 may be used. This should be a strategy of last resort due the signi fi cant potential for bleeding complications associated with cannulae insertion and limb ischemia. Such devices have been used successfully in traumatic brain injury cases and ARDS [ 35 ] and have also been employed on few occasions in ALF patients with developed ARDS post-OLT, when ICH has remained problematic (unreported).",

An assessment of the recovery of ICP auto regulatory mechanisms can be achieved by evaluating ICP responses to enforced elevations in pCO 2 , mean arterial pressure and reductions in sedation. The return of ICP autoregulation permits a more sustained withdrawal of sedation and weaning from mandatory modes of ventilation. However, once sedation is decreased or stopped neurological problems may arise such as slow emergence from sedation or intensive care delirium. There is also a risk of both subclinical and clinical seizures likely related to ICH during ALF. Critical illness polymotorneuropathy (CIMPM) is also highly prevalent, due to the signi fi cant number of risk factors for this condition encountered in ALF, including sepsis, profound systemic in fl ammatory response syndrome (SIRS), exposure to steroids, high protein catabolism and MOF [ 38 ] .

There are also signi fi cant reductions in the production of complement factors impairing opsonisation of bacteria [ 49 ] . There is evidence of impaired neutrophil function with reduced chemotaxis, bacteriocidal activity, and impaired production of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide with defective phagocytosis. Additionally, both monocytes and macrophage have been implicated in the initiation, propagation, and resolution of acute liver injury. It appears that shortly after acute liver injury macrophages enthusiastically release chemokines and pro-in fl ammatory cytokines. This response is balanced by the initiation of anti-in fl ammatory responses accompanying the recruitment of monocytes to the site of the liver injury to initiate repair processes. Activated macrophages release TNF-a , interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, proteolytic enzymes, reactive oxygen intermediates, and lysosomal enzymes. Bacterial products can also induce TNF-a affect-ing microvascular permeability and further releases of IL-6. The elevation of TNF levels appears to correlate with the development of sepsis and IL-6 with MOF and mortality (Fig. 2.3 ).",

The release of vasoactive mediators, like nitric oxide and other free radicals, leads to a hyperdynamic circulation with circulatory vasoplegia \"vascular failure\" and functional hypovolemia. These vasoactive mediator-induced changes to the circulation cause heightened homeostatic responses involving the sympathetic nervous system and renin angiotensin system (RAS) culminating in arterial vasoconstriction in the kidney. The intraglomerular arteriolar vasoconstriction results in ischemic acute tubular necrosis that is now increasingly recognised as a complex interplay between endothelial dysfunction and leukocyte activation and release of cytokines causing profound intracellular oxidative stress. Furthermore, recent studies of hemodynamic changes in septic AKI suggest other microcirculatory changes, particularly renal venous congestion associated with disturbed cellular energy mechanisms independent of tissue oxygen availability [ 52 ] . Patients who are critically ill with ALF can display a wide spectrum of susceptibilities for AKI beyond those associated with the \"vascular failure\" and hemodynamic changes encountered. These are related to failure to increase or decrease afferent arteriolar vascular tone leading to reduced glomerular perfusion and ischemia in hypotensive states. Additional insult can be caused by the numerous drugs that patients are exposed to, which can be directly nephrotoxic or sometimes implicated in tubulointerstitial nephritis. Furthermore, speci fi c glomerular pathologies, that result in rapidly progressive glomerulonephritides, should be considered and excluded by including urine dipstick and microscopy for red cell casts in conjunction with testing for autoantibodies to exclude small vessel vasculitides and serological testing for leptospirosis (Weil's disease), if the history and examination suggest such diagnoses (Fig. 2.4 ) [ 53 ] .",

Evidence in support of this theory originates from rat models that demonstrate that NAC does not protect tubular cells [ 54 ] . Paracetamol is a phenacetin metabolite that has been implicated in proximal tubule cell apoptosis in AKI and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Consequently, cellular mechanisms and the induction of apoptosis in renal tubular cells has been the focus of studies into paracetamolinduced nephrotoxicity. It seems likely that the mechanism for nephrotoxicity lies with endoplasmic reticulum stress and caspase-mediated mechanisms that cause apoptosis [ 55 ] . Other speculated mechanisms include induction of oxidative enzymes such as cytochrome P-450 mixed function oxidase isoenzymes in the proximal tubule of the kidney. Additionally, the role of prostaglandin synthetase and N -deacetylase enzymes have also been postulated to be involved [ 56 ] .

Numerous issues are associated with CRRT in patients with ALF, including the need for anticoagulation to extend fi lter life span. Despite the coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia seen in ALF it has been demonstrated that CRRT circuits continue to clot as a result of losses of both pro-and anticoagulation factors [ 57 ] . Good vascular access, as well as an expanded intravascular compartment, is essential to extend fi lter life. Speci fi c, yet standard maneuvers to extended fi lter life include the use of predilution fl uid replacement; high blood fl ows to reduce the ultra fi ltration fraction, prompt attention to machine alarms, and use of prostacyclin anticoagulation. Prostacyclin has a half-life measured in seconds and represents a safe anticoagulant in ALF in the absence of hemorrhage. The use of heparin is not recommended during the initial presentation of ALF with evolving coagulopathy and citrate anticoagulation is complicated by the risk of citrate toxicity, due to the integral role of the liver in citrate metabolism. However, a case report of the safe use of a citrate-based dialysate, where heparin and regional citrate were contraindicated, demonstrating no signs of citrate toxicity intra-operatively during liver transplantation for a patient with paracetamol-induced ALF patient and AKI [ 58 ] . It is likely this was possible due to the low doses of citrate used (0.8 mmol/L; only about one-fi fth of the concentration necessary to achieve anticoagulation) and the likely predominant role of muscle metabolising citrate. The role of citrate dialysate for RRT in ALF is, however, likely to be limited to short treatment periods and the intra-operative period and is not a common practice in the UK.",

There is, however, little compounding evidence available to clearly delineate any of these issues. Only the Randomized Evaluation of Normal versus Augmented Level (RENAL) Replacement Therapy Study to date has endeavoured to answer and also establish some conclusions regarding the dose of ultra fi ltration in AKI. No associated bene fi t was demonstrated with higher ultra fi ltration doses of 40 mL/kg/h vs. lower rates of 25 mL/kg/h [ 59 ] . However, RRT often needs to be tailored to address the clinical fl uctuations affecting fl uid management and the profound metabolic disarray encountered. In ALF mortality is inextricably linked to the severity of the underlying liver insult. However, profound catabolism, hyperlactemia, SIRS, vasoplegia, and high vasopressor requirements often necessitate the use of pulse high volume hemo fi ltration (PHVH) at 60-90 mL/kg/h. PHVH has been shown in animal and clinical studies to effectively reduce vasopressor requirements, which in ALF patients can be valuable to prevent vasopressor-induced ischemic insults [ 60 ] . Although there is no proven mortality bene fi t, it does allow the effective management of episodes of deterioration often associated with sepsis limiting further hepatic damage.",

The value of these parameters was then assessed, with the subsequent development of the King's College criteria (KCC), which have become the most widely used criteria for assessing prognosis in ALF. However, despite demonstrating high speci fi city for mortality without transplantation it has been widely accepted that the sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) of the KCC are low. These criteria tend to fail to identify patients early enough in the clinical course of ALF or to predict those that will die without OLT.

The impact of transplantation on quality of life is an important aspect of the decision-making process especially for those patients with POD, who may also have chronic psychiatric conditions predominate their lives.

Consequently, there will be an ongoing endeavour to develop improved criteria that identify patients with a high mortality earlier and with greater accuracy. All the current criteria are associated with problems of accurate selection of patients for transplantation, which can greatly affect patient survival, graft use from the limited donor pool and the physical and psychological consequences associated with long-term immunosuppression. Consequently, all patients with ALF require an early assessment of prognosis that must be individualized in the context of existing validated criteria. Thereafter, a process of continuous review of any such decision to list for transplantation is essential, due to the large potential for signi fi cant clinical deterioration that may nullify any mortality bene fi t from transplantation. The development of ongoing speci fi c organ failure, despite maximal supportive therapies should prompt re-evaluation of any listing decision by the multidisciplinary team.",

However the cut-off age associated with poor prognosis ranges from as low as 40 to as high as 60 years. Interestingly, older age does seem to be correlated with overall poor survival, however, there is no statistical difference between young and old in spontaneous survival. Ultimately, older patients require greater attention to co-morbidities and whole body biology than age per se (Fig. 2.5 ) .",

Additionally, particular attention to the optimization of the circulation with both appropriate early invasive monitoring directing aggressive fl uid resuscitation and vasopressor support is the key. The early use of empirical antibiotics and antifungal agents along with strict infection control mea-sures are necessary. Furthermore, due to the high frequency of sepsis in the absence of SIRS symptoms a low threshold for obtaining cultures and broadening antibiotic cover deteriorates is required when the clinical condition. A keen awareness of the potential for raised ICH, particularly in the young, necessitates appropriate monitoring and management, which will be discussed in detail in a separate chapter. Furthermore, in parallel with supportive measures an assessment of the clinical history and prognostic variables must be undertaken to determine, which patients ful fi l national transplantation criteria. The decision to list a patient for super-urgent liver transplantation is often dif fi cult and can be affected by age, co-morbidities, the dynamics of the clinical condition, and psychosocial factors. The clinical course for those that are not transplanted is often ( c ) requiring vasopressor or no vasopressor following transplantation ( d ) with liver grafts with a calculated donor risk score either high or low precarious and associated with a high mortality. It is affected by the speed and degree of hepatic regeneration and the impact of the cumulative insults that include recurrent sepsis, persistent AKI requiring prolonged RRT, and critical illness neuropathy/myopathy resulting in extended periods of rehabilitation in those that survive. On the contrary, patients who proceed to transplantation and receive a good functioning graft often experience swift resolution of the circulatory and neurovascular disarray and have signi fi cantly improved outcomes albeit offset by the long-term impact of lifelong immunosuppression.",
