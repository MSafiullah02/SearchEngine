Asian patients with community-acquired pneumonia differ from their Western counterparts in microbiological aetiology, in particular the prominence of Gram-negative organisms, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Burkholderia pseudomallei and Staphylococcus aureus. In addition, the differences in socioeconomic and health-care infrastructures limit the usefulness of Western management guidelines for pneumonia in Asia. The importance of emerging infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and avian influenza infection remain as close concerns for practising respirologists in Asia. Specific infections such as melioidosis, dengue haemorrhagic fever, scrub typhus, leptospirosis, salmonellosis, penicilliosis marneffei, malaria, amoebiasis, paragonimiasis, strongyloidiasis, gnathostomiasis, trinchinellosis, schistosomiasis and echinococcosis occur commonly in Asia and manifest with a prominent respiratory component.

Asia is a highly heterogeneous region with vastly different cultures and ethnic constitutions, health-care systems, vaccination programs and socioeconomic developments. Rampant antibiotic resistance exhibited by respiratory pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, poverty, malnutrition, over-population, environmental damage, poor public health infrastructure, failure to implement estab-lished health-care interventions and host factors such as genetic susceptibility to diseases such as tuberculosis (TB) make it particularly challenging for clinicians in Asia. The increasing and worrying popularity of smoking remains a prime determinant to weakening host factors in many Asian countries particularly China where 63% of men smoke. 1 Background diseases such as COPD, diabetes mellitus and HIV infection (with India having the second largest population of infected patients in the world) further complicates the situation. 2 The warm and humid climate in many Asian countries provide suitable environment for many pathogens, vectors and intermediate hosts to flourish. Infectious diseases in Southeast Asia account for more than 17 million deaths annually.

Common pathogens causing communityacquired pneumonia (CAP) in the West include S. pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chylamydia pneumoniae and Legionella pneumoniae, with similar pathogens in Japan and Korea. 9 Among 955 cases of Asian adult CAP patients, S. pneumoniae (29% of identifiable pathogens), Klebsiella pneumoniae (15.4%) and Haemophilus influenzae (15.1%) were the commonest bacterial pathogens, while M. pneumoniae (11%) and C. pneumoniae (13.4%) were the commonest 'atypical' pathogens. Legionella pneumophilia is probably only infrequently encountered and accounted for 1.1% of cases. 8, 10 However, Gram-negative bacilli, such as K. pneumoniae, accounted for 10% of identifiable pathogens in Malaysia and Singapore. 11, 12 Mycobacterium tuberculosis accounts for 12.2-21% of CAP in Hong Kong and Singapore. 12, 13 Burkholderia pseudomallei, the cause of melioidosis, accounts for 32% of the identifiable pathogens among hospitalized patients in Thailand. 14 M. pneumoniae (35.5%) and Staphylococcus aureus (41.9%) are particularly prominent in Bangladesh, Pakistan and India. 15, 16 Although studies on the viral aetiology of CAP in Asia are scare, a recent Australian study showed that influenza, parainfluenza, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus and picornavirus account for 15% of CAP. 17 In addition, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus and other viruses account for pneumonia in 41.2% of patients, thereby addressing the importance of viral aetiology in Asia. 18 Tuberculosis is a major cause of CAP in Asia and detailed discussion on this important topic is beyond the scope of this article. Nonetheless, it is important to register certain important facts in relation to CAP in relation to the tropics. M. tuberculosis is a highly infectious pathogen with airborne route for transmission. Eighty per cent of the global burden of TB is carried by 23 countries nearly all of which are tropical. 19 This is not only consequent from genetic susceptibility, socioeconomical deprivation, but also the effect of increasingly rampant HIV infection which imposes a 10-fold risk for development and a higher mortality for TB among those affected. 20, 21 Inadequate dust control, with its associated development of silicosis in Asia among miners and some builders, also predispose these populations to development of TB. 22 Helminthic infections, endemic in developing countries, induce a Th2 immune response which could predispose patients to development of TB. 23 The diagnosis of childhood TB is difficult at best as TB children are generally pauci-bacillary and usually smear-negative. Indeed, positive culture for TB is achieved only in 10-30% of treated children. 24 The endemic nature of TB, use of Bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccination and HIV infection could affect the development of a positive tuberculin skin test. Undiagnosed TB, sputum smear negative or extrapulmonary, is responsible for 44% of HIV-infected patients dying with wasting. 25 The World Health Organization case definition for smear-negative pulmonary TB, based on demonstration of three negative sputum smears, radiographic features of active pulmonary TB and lack of response to broad-spectrum antibiotics therapy, renders 14% of otherwise treatable conditions misdiagnosed as TB. 26 The use of anti-TB drugs is already well standardized with preference given to using rifampicin and isoniazid as first line, with additional ethambutol and pyrazinamide added to the first 2 months of treatment, for a 6-month regimen for most individuals. The strategy of Directly Observed Therapy Shortcourse (DOTS) reduces drug resistance, which is desperately important for reducing the trend of increasing resistance to currently available first-line drugs. 27 Rifampicin is relatively expensive for the poorest countries which only use short-course therapy for sputum smear-positive patients. Those who are sputum negative or have extra-pulmonary diseases are treated with longer regimens that include streptomycin or thioacetazone. The latter can cause severe and sometimes fatal skin reactions in HIV-infected individuals, and are less effective than rifampicin-based regimens. 28 The development of multi-drug-resistant to TB, defined by resistant to both rifampicin and isoniazid, is a major worry in Asia. Prevention of TB remains a top priority for Asia in light of the difficulty in treatment both in drug administration and monitoring. The use of Bacille Calmette-Guerin is only able to protect against TB meningitis and miliary TB, rather than adult cases. 29 The ideal situation would be to develop more effective TB vaccines.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 305, "end": 306, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 456, "end": 463, "text": "(15.1%)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 696, "end": 698, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 699, "end": 701, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 828, "end": 831, "text": "11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 832, "end": 834, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 919, "end": 922, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 923, "end": 925, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1084, "end": 1091, "text": "(35.5%)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1188, "end": 1191, "text": "15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1192, "end": 1194, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1406, "end": 1408, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1618, "end": 1620, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2053, "end": 2055, "text": "19", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2297, "end": 2300, "text": "20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2301, "end": 2303, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2470, "end": 2472, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2612, "end": 2614, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2819, "end": 2821, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 3099, "end": 3101, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 3408, "end": 3410, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 3872, "end": 3874, "text": "27", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 4295, "end": 4297, "text": "28", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 4681, "end": 4683, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "PNEUMONIA"}, {"text": "The data show very considerable difference from the West in terms of the aetiology for CAP in Asia (Table 1) . Antibacterial resistance in S. pneumoniae is increasing worldwide, affecting principally b-lactams and macrolides, and resistance has been reported to be as high as 90% in Hong Kong. Among 955 cases of adult CAP patients from eight Asian countries, 17.5% and 35.1% of the S. pneumonia isolates showed penicillin intermediate (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) = 0.12-1 mg/mL) and penicillin resistance (MIC \u0546 2 mg/mL) respectively. 8 Among 665 adult patients from seven Chinese cities, 20.3% and 75% of S. pneumoniae isolates were resistant to penicillin and macrolides respectively. 30 Among 265 invasive isolates of S. pneumonia obtained between 1995 and 2001 in Hong Kong, 62.6% isolates were susceptible to penicillin, 20% were intermediately resistant, and 17.4% were resistant. The overall resistance to levofloxacin (MIC \u0546 8 mg/mL) was 3.8% but this increased to 15.2% among the penicillin-resistant isolates. All levofloxacin-resistant isolates were clonally related, had reduced susceptibility to penicillin, cefotaxime and clarithromycin, and were from patients over 50 years of age. 31 With the aforementioned data, it is hard to determine if Western guidelines on CAP are totally applicable to Asia (Tables 2 and 3 ). Although resistant S. pneumoniae can still be treated with first-line antibiotics such as b-lactams at higher dosages, monotherapy with macrolides might not be so effective. 38 Findings from large observational studies suggest that current levels of b-lactam resistance generally do not cause treatment failures when appropriate agents (i.e. amoxicillin, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime) and doses are used. However, discordant therapy with cefuroxime in patients with pneumococcal bacteraemia has been associated with an excessively high failure rate com-pared with other discordant therapies. Many experts believe that treatment failure is more likely for strains with penicillin resistance defined by MIC \u0546 4 mg/mL. In fact, these opinions are reflected by the new 2008 Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute breakpoints (formerly NCCLS) for parenteral penicillin G of susceptible (\u0545 2 mg/mL), intermediate (4 mg/mL) and resistant (\u0546 8 mg/mL) for non-meningeal infections such as CAP. 39 Ketolides could be an alternative, but toxicity issues have recently restricted the use of telithromycin. Respiratory fluoroquinolones are attractive in being highly potent antibiotics with excellent blood and lung tissue penetration but their efficacy against M. tuberculosis could potentially mask such infections. The use of fluoroquinolones as first-line anti-CAP agents in Asia should be questioned. For treatment of multidrug-resistant S. pneumoniae, ketolides and fluoroquinolones can be considered, and the potential use of cephalosporins, carbapenems, glycopeptides, lipopeptides, ketolides, lincosamides, oxazolidinones, glycylcyclines, quinolones, deformylase inhibitors are being evaluated.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 548, "end": 549, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 700, "end": 702, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1210, "end": 1212, "text": "31", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1520, "end": 1522, "text": "38", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 2331, "end": 2333, "text": "39", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 99, "end": 108, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 1327, "end": 1342, "text": "(Tables 2 and 3", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "PNEUMONIA"}, {"text": "The horrors surrounding the onset of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV), are still vivid memories for most to date. SARS claimed the lives of 774 of 8098 affected cases scattered across 29 countries on all five continents. 40 There are three non-distinct and highly individualized phases of SARS, namely, viral replication, inflammatory pneumonitis and then pulmonary fibrosis. Peak shedding of SARS-CoV in nasopharyngeal aspirates and faeces peaks at 6-11 and 9-14 days after disease onset respectively. Pathologically, SARS shows diffuse alveolar damage, secondary bacterial pneumonia and giant-cell and macrophages infiltration into the alveoli and lung interstitium, pulmonary thromboemboli, and small airway and airspace fibrogranulation tissue proliferation. The latter resembles bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia. 41, 42 Diagnostic criteria proposed by the World Health Organization and Center of Disease Control and Prevention of USA are epidemiologically orientated, and rely on positive identification of SARS-CoV. [43] [44] [45] These are, therefore, unhelpful at the bedside. The key diagnostic process relies on the demonstration of an epidemiological linkage, presence of pneumonia resistant to treatment and clinical features of SARS. It is thus extremely difficult, if not impossible, to diagnose the first case of SARS in any future outbreaks. The radiological patterns for consolidation are highly variable and include: bilateral patchy consolidation, nodular shadows, confluent consolidation, diffuse consolidation and even ARDS 46 (Fig. 1 ). Generally, radiographic opacities peak between 8 and 10 days after disease onset when bilateral disease usually occurs. 47 Pneumomediastinum and pneumothoraces, often spontaneous (but also occur with assisted Respiratory infections unique to Asia ventilation), can complicate severe cases. Demonstration of a fourfold rise in anti-SARS-CoV titre confirms the diagnosis. Antibody response appears only around days 10-14 after onset of fever but may take up to 28 days. 44 Demonstration of a positive viral culture takes too long for prompt bedside decisions and is only useful as a confirmation. Nasopharyngeal aspirate, with a sensitivity of 80%, potentially infectious to staff during the collection, is best obtained in the first 5 days of the illness. 48 The treatment for SARS is largely unsubstantiated with controlled trial data. Theoretically, an efficacious antiviral agent would abort the illness if given early. In 2003, SARS patients were treated with a broad spectrum antiviral agent, namely ribavirin, as well as corticosteroid, with apparent good initial responses clinically and radiologically for some patients, thereby leading to the use of this combination as a standard anti-SARS regimen. 49, 50 Ribavirin is now considered to be of no efficacy or even harmful. Patients treated with anti-proteases like Kaletra (ritonavir 400 mg and lopinavir 100 mg for 14 days), combined with ribavirin, apparently had lower incidence of ARDS/death (2.4% vs 28.8%), steroid usage and nosocomial infections than historical controls. 51 Corticosteroids in combination with interferon alfacon-1 appeared to improve the intensive care unit admission rate, mechanical ventilation need and mortality. 52 antimicrobial therapy within the past 3 months, hospitalization within the past month, alcoholism, immune-suppressive illness (including therapy with corticosteroids), multiple medical comorbidities, exposure to a child in a day care center. \u00a7 Azithromycin, clarithromycin. \u00b6 Gemifloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin (gemifloxacin is only available in oral formulation).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 279, "end": 281, "text": "40", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 894, "end": 897, "text": "41,", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 898, "end": 900, "text": "42", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1098, "end": 1102, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1103, "end": 1107, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1108, "end": 1112, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1621, "end": 1623, "text": "46", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1755, "end": 1757, "text": "47", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 2103, "end": 2105, "text": "44", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 2390, "end": 2392, "text": "48", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 2843, "end": 2846, "text": "49,", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 2847, "end": 2849, "text": "50", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 3172, "end": 3174, "text": "51", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1624, "end": 1631, "text": "(Fig. 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "SEVERE ACUTE RESPIRATORY SYNDROME"}, {"text": "The judicial use of high-dose methylprednisolone therapy for deteriorating SARS patients, with deteriorating radiographic consolidation, increasing oxygen requirement and respiratory distress, was associated with significant and sometime dramatic radiographic and clinical recovery. 53 Patients who received pulse steroid (methylprednisolone \u0546 500 mg/day) as initial steroid therapy had less oxygen requirement, better radiographic outcome and less likelihood of requiring rescue pulse steroid therapy than their counterparts.

Controlled clinical trials on the efficacy of antivirals (NA inhibitors), supportive therapy or adjuvant care have not been performed. NA inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir) are used for treatment and prophylaxis with the human influenza A and B infection, and are efficacious for animal models with H5N1. 59 Oseltamivir has been used in H5N1 outbreaks and such therapy decreases the viral load in nasal secretions of patients for susceptible strains. 60 Resistance to oseltamivir can also occur in previously treated patients. 60 The use of oseltamivir and zanamivir in influenza A only provides a modest improvement in symptoms relief, and shortens the duration of fever by 1.1 days (out of 4.3 days) in otherwise healthy young patients if taken within 48 h of symptom onset. 61 The high fatality among treated H5N1 patients from Thailand and Vietnam strongly indicate a low, if any, clinical efficacy of oseltamivir in human H5N1 infection. 62 Oseltamivir has significant adverse reactions including nausea (7.0-10.7%), vomiting (2.1-8%), diarrhoea (3.2-5.5%), bronchitis (0.7-3.7%), headache (1.6-20.1%) and fatigue (0.8-7.9%), which could mimic influenza itself. 63 The use of steroid appears to be inevitable in desperately ill patients with ARDS.
