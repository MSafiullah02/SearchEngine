            "text": "In schistosomiasis, a large number of schistosome eggs is retained in the final host liver, eliciting inflammatory immune responses and the subsequent formation of granuloma and fibrosis 1. After transmission of these parasites in the human host, male\u2013female pairing is the key event for the development of female parasites. Female schistosomes from single sex infection are stunted in size and are sexually immature, and their successful development depends on their pairing with a male worm inside the gynaecophoral canal of the male worm 2, 3. When paired female worms are separated from male worms, they stop laying eggs and regress to an immature state. However, when such immature females are allowed to couple, they maturate again 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, suggesting a specific interaction between male and female worms during such pairing, leading to the development of mature female worms. Different factors have been proposed for such sexual maturation. They include physical contact, nutrition 5, 7, 8, chemical stimuli 9, 10, 11 and some polypeptides and proteins 8, 12, 13, 14. In addition, studies on differently expressed genes and proteins between male and female worm 3, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 also suggested the presence of a development signaling from males leading to the direct or indirect activation of female\u2010specific gene expression 4, 12, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27.",

However, this amount is significantly increased post male\u2013female pairing 29. A wide distribution of SjGCP is also found on the surface of adult female worms after pairing. Additionally, the maturation of schistosome vitelline glands and the ovary is limited to the regions of the female worm elapsed within the gynaecophoral canal of the adult male 24. Therefore, a strong maturational signal is likely to be associated with the male\u2013female pairing.",

This may be due to: (i) the unstability of naked siRNA as noted by Krautz\u2010Peterson et al.\n34 and (ii) the fact that target gene mRNA levels are higher to begin with 35. The appearance of some SjGCP protein in immunofluorescence and western blotting studies probably suggests incomplete SjGCP mRNA silencing, such that the unsilenced portion translated into protein. Because the SjGCP antibodies obtained from rabbit by immunizing the full length recombinant SjGCP are polyantibodies, it was not surprising to observe some weak noise in the fluorescence signal in an area other than the gynaecophoral canal (e.g. the protruding part of the schistosomes). This could also be due to direct exposure of this part to fluorescent light.",

Thus, there might be incomplete pairing at 7 days post\u2010treatment in vitro. This could one of the possible reasons why less pair numbers were obtained than expected theoretically. This might also be due to the difference in the habitat for parasite in culture and in the live host. Furthermore, the type and concentration of nutrients in media, culturing environment and the parasite density might have had some influence in pairing in vitro. To eliminate the influence of such intangible factors and to corroborate the in vitro result, siRNAs were administered in the mice infected with S. japonicum. Pereira et al.\n37 also used a similar method to deliver siRNA in the infected mice with Schistosoma mansoni to silence hypoxanthine\u2010guanine phosphoribosyltransferase. At 6 days post\u2010treatment, a significant reduction in target mRNA was also observed and the total number of parasites was reduced by approximately 27% 37. In the present study, upon systemic administration of siRNA in the infected mice with S. japonicum, reductions in parasite pairing and burden were observed. Moreover, relatively better inhibition was observed in the 19 days group by injecting 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methyl modified siRNAs compared to unmodified siRNAs. This could be due to 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methyl modified siRNAs being more stable and resistant to nuclear degradation 38. We administered a double dose at 14 and 15 days post\u2010infection in the 19 days groups because parasites usually initiate male\u2013female pairing at that period of time. After applying a smaller total dose of 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methyl modified siRNAs, considerable reductions were also observed in the 28 days and 32 days groups. It remains to be determined in future studies how much siRNA was taken up in the parasite.

            "text": "To date, the most acceptable hypothesis concerning the biological functions of pairing is the separation of labour in sexually dimorphic schistosomes. The male schistosome ensures the survival of females by providing physical transportation and musculature to aid feeding and other maturation factors. SjGCP contains multiple short, conserved repeat regions with a sequence similar to the developmentally regulated neural cell adhesion molecule fisciclin I 28, 35, suggesting that SjGCP may have implications for the development of schistosome. In the present study, we demonstrated that siRNA\u2010mediated SjGCP silencing has an influence on early male\u2013female pairing and on parasite burden in mice infected with S. japonicum. Our results show that SjGCP silencing led to a significant inhibition of parasite pairing (52% for unmodified siRNA and 74% for 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methyl modified siRNAs) in mice at 19 days post\u2010infection. Although SjGCP has been significantly suppressed both at transcript and protein levels (Figures 4c and 4d), there was only a 7.2% pairing inhibition at 32 days post\u2010infection. Furthermore, the reduction of parasite burden increased to 36% instead. The significant reduction in parasite burden was also probably due to the fact that an unpairing parasite could not survive as a single adult parasite in a final host. Our results suggested that SjGCP likely plays multiple roles in the schistosome. SjGCP is likely to be involved in early male\u2013female pairing. SjGCP also likely plays an important role in parasite development. The silencing of SjGCP could postpone parasite pairing and affect subsequent development. It will be interesting to further characterize the effect of SjGCP silencing on the development of the reproductive system, sexual maturation and/or egg production in schistosomes in future studies.",
