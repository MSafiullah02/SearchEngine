A large number of caveolae can be found in endothelial cells (van Deurs et al., 2003; Navarro et al., 2004), adipocytes (Razani et al., 2002; Guan et al., 2016), fibroblasts (Razani et al., 2002), and type I pneumocytes (Jung et al., 2012; Bj\u00f6rnstad et al., 2014). Cav-1 can mediate simian virus 40 uptake through caveolae, and the internalized caveolae carry the virus into smooth-surfaced endoplasmic reticulum (Pelkmans et al., 2001).",

Capillaries are important vessels; hence, most of the exchange of water, water-soluble substances, and respiratory gases takes place through the capillary wall. Transcytosis in the endothelial cells (van Deurs et al., 2003; Navarro et al., 2004) is one of the fundamental processes by which the endothelial cells contribute to the communication between blood and tissues. The endothelial transcytosis is a basic cytological function that is carried out by caveolae. Cav-1 binds cholesterol in 1 to 1 ratio; therefore, the changes in the Cav-1 expression influence the cholesterol homeostasis. The excess free cholesterol is toxic (Warner et al., 1995; Fielding and Fielding, 1997); therefore, the cholesterol efflux from the IFE could be essential for the bird. The middle plical vessel (MPV) of BF branches off to form interfollicular arterioles, from which the CM capillary web offshoots (Schoenwolf et al., 1981; Abbate et al., 2007) for supplying the follicular cortex and medulla. Serious infection of infectious bursa disease virus (IBDV) may result in hemorrhage in the BF, and the CM capillary web is possibly the major site of bursal hemorrhage.",

Among the cylindrical-shaped cells, mucus-secreting (Figure 2a) and Cav-1-positive cells can be distinguished (Figure 1a). The Movat pentachrome staining shows the mucus in the apical portion of the IFE cells and the continuous mucous membrane on the surface epithelium of the IFE (Figure 2a). The cells of the FAE do not express Cav-1 (Figure 1a), and the mucous membrane is absent in the FAE (Figure 2a). In the FAE, the absence of Cav-1 suggests the lack of Cav-1-mediated endocytosis by the cells. The shape of the Cav-1-positive cell looks like a \u201ctennis-racket\u201d (Figure 1b). The \u201chandle\u201d of the racket starts close to the basal lamina, and below the nucleus, the \u201chandle\u201d splits and surrounds the nucleus and possibly the TGN above the nucleus (Figure 1c). The cytoplasm reveals a fine granulated reaction product (Figure 1b). Occasionally, the basal cell also expresses Cav-1 (Figure 1b and d). The Cav-1 appearance in the cuboidal-shaped basal cells suggests that these cells could be the precursor of both types of cylindrical-shaped cells; for example, they function as \u201cepithelial progenitor or stem cells,\u201d although mitosis in these cells cannot be found; however, their number decreases with age, and in late IBDV infection (Figure 2g).",

            "text": "The effect of Gumboro virus infection on the primary lymphoid organ of the BF is well-documented, both morphologically (K\u00e4ufer and Weiss, 1976; Panisup et al., 1988; Ramm et al., 1991; Vervelde and Davison, 1997) and immunologically (Naqi et al., 1983; Rautenschlein et al., 2007; Ingrao et al., 2013). However, no information was available about the effect of viral infection on the cells of IFE. After 2 d pi, the \u03b1-Gumboro immunostaining shows high variability among the bursal follicles (Figure 2d). A considerable number of follicles do not show \u03b1-Gumboro staining, while in the positive follicles, the infected cells are localized in one or two rings. In the case of one ring, the \u03b1-Gumboro-positive cells are located in the follicular medulla, close to the CM border. If there are two \u03b1-Gumboro-positive rings, the outer ring is in the cortex, also close to the CM border (Figure 2d). Between the two \u03b1-Gumboro-positive rings, there are scattered positive cells, which migrate between the cortex and medulla (Figure 2d). In this stage of pi, there is no significant alternation in the Cav-1-positive IFE cells. Between 2 and 7 d pi, the Cav-1 expression is variable in the endothelial cells of the CM capillary web, but the number of Cav-1-positive IFE cells drastically decreased by day 4 pi (Figure 3a). The variability in the histopathological signs of follicular infection does not reflect in the Cav-1 expression of the IFE cells, which suggests that the Cav-1 expression is independent of the primary lymphoid organ (FAE+follicle). The virus infection might have hindered the differentiating capacity of basal cells into Cav-1-positive cells. The differentiation is possibly shifted towards the mucus-secreting cell because in later stages of the infection, the surface epithelium is highly folded and consists of mucus-secreting cells (Figure 2c).",

The \u201csticky\u201d state of the mucous membrane may be supported by the finding that the mucous-negative FAE cells are devoid of a mucous membrane (Figure 2b). At this stage of infection, the FAE consists of two kinds of cells: (i) the sui generis FAE cells and (ii) mucus-producing transformed cells. The first one is devoid of a mucous membrane, and the second one reveals a mucous membrane. After IBDV infection, the regeneration capacity of bursal follicles may be influenced by the proportion of the two kinds of cells.",

            "text": "By day 4 pi, the \u03b1-Gumboro-positive cells of the inner ring are scattered over the medulla (Figure 2e). The interfollicular connective tissue does not show \u03b1-Gumboro-positive cells. There is a significant decrease in the number of Cav-1-positive IFE cells, and the majority of cells show only the \u201chead\u201d of tennis racket (Figure 3a). The Cav-1-positive IFE cell releases cholesterol into the bursal lumen (B\u00f3di et al., 2017). The decreased number of Cav-1-positive cells suggests that the cholesterol efflux is also diminished or ceased. High cholesterol level is toxic for the bird, which may worsen the clinical syndrome of IBDV. The IBDV infection temporary stopped the differentiation of new Cav-1-positive cells. The drastic decrease in the number of Cav-1-positive cells took place by 4 d pi, which may allow us to estimate the differentiation time of Cav-1 and possibly also the mucin-secreting cells from the basal cells. The 4 to 5 d of differentiation time may be confirmed by the finding that a considerable number of Cav-1-positive cells emerged between 21 and 28 d pi. At day 7 pi, in the majority of follicles, the medulla and cortex were cleared from Gumboro-positive cells, but many virus-containing cells appeared in the interfollicular connective tissue (Figure 2f). In the IFE cells, Cav-1 expression can be seen only occasionally (Figure 3b). Parallel with the drastically decreased Cav-1-positive IFE cells, the number of the secretory cells increased, and almost every cylindrical-shaped cell is mucous positive (Figure 2g). In some places, the capillary web seems to be defective (not complete around the follicular medulla; Figure 3b). Possibly, the endothelial cells lost their capability for caveola formation. The absence of caveola formation in the endothelial cell of the capillary web results in the disappearance of transcytosis, which subsequently damages the communication between blood and bursal follicles. This phenomenon may result in bursal hemorrhage. At 21 d pi, Cav-1 expression may be found in few IFE cells and in the rest of the CM capillary web (Figure 3c). By day 28 pi, the follicular organization cannot be recognized, but many IFE cells again produced Cav-1 (Figure 3d and e). The shape of these Cav-1-positive cells looks similar to that of normal basal cells, and they appeared in different levels of the epithelium. By day 28 pi, these randomly localized Cav-1-positive cells in the IFE suggest that the IFE lost its polarity, which may be maintained by the primary lymphoid organ (FAE+follicle). This observation shows that Cav-1 expression is not re-established in the former Cav-1-positive cells, but the differentiation capability of basal cells might have been regained following the infection. In the MPV, the Cav-1 expression became strong, but the CM capillary web disappeared (Figure 3d).",
