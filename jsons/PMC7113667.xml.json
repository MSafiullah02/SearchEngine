            "text": "The past 15 years has seen the emergence of two novel coronaviruses that have infected humans resulting in a high morbidity and mortality. Until 2003 it was thought that coronavirus infections, such as OC43 and 229E were associated with mild respiratory disease and there was little reason to develop novel therapeutic options for these coronavirus infections. The global outbreak of SARS in 2003 with a 10% fatality rate, and the recent emergence of MERS-CoV infection, as well as other recently recognized coronavirus infections such as NL63 and HKU1 have demonstrated the need for investigation into treatment options of severe coronavirus infections. MERS-CoV was first identified in June 2012 from a 60 year old patient from Middle East who developed clinical symptoms and signs similar to SARS, and who eventually died from multi organ failure (Zaki et al., 2012). A novel coronavirus was isolated, initially called HCoV-EMC but renamed as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (de Groot et al., 2013). Since 2012 the virus has continued to cause severe zoonotic human disease in the Middle East, sometimes associated with outbreaks of human-to-human transmission within health care facilities (Arabi et al., 2017; Chan et al., 2014; Perlman and McCray, 2013). In May 2015 a large outbreak occurred in Korea (Korean Society of Infectious, Korean Society for Healthcare-associated Infection and Prevention, 2015), highlighting the threat to global public health security.",

Furthermore, we showed that in contrast to SARS-CoV infection, MERS-CoV infection elicited a lower pro-inflammatory cytokine response including the type I and III interferons (Chan et al., 2013). This evasion of innate immune induction and reduced interferon (IFN) response suggested that exogenous IFN may be a possible treatment options for human MERS-CoV infection. A previous study showed that pegylated IFN exhibited a more potent antiviral effect to MERS-CoV than SARS-CoV in cell culture and macaque model (de Wilde et al., 2013; Falzarano et al., 2013) and it was proposed that this was due to the lack of a MERS-CoV homolog of SARS-CoV ORF6 protein that blocks the IFN induced translocation of STAT1 - a factor essential for signaling via the IFN receptor that leads to the induction of IFN associated antiviral genes. In the macaque model, IFN was used together with ribavirin and this led to improved clinical symptoms following MERS-CoV infection, with microarray analysis showing lower expression of inflammatory genes (Falzarano et al., 2013). Nevertheless, a number of recent clinical studies reported that the IFN and ribavirin combination did not improve long-term survival, and was not beneficial to patients who received the treatment late after infection (Al-Tawfiq et al., 2014; Omrani et al., 2014). This indicates that there is a need to consider other therapeutic combination for treating MERS-CoV infection.",

            "text": "Cyclosporine, such as cyclosporin A (CsA) and its derivatives has been shown to inhibit MERS-CoV replication in vitro (de Wilde et al., 2013). It has been demonstrated that CsA could restore type I IFN expression upon hepatitis C or rotavirus virus infection (Liu et al., 2011; Shen et al., 2013). Combined use of CsA and type I IFN was shown to inhibit hepatitis C virus replication and trigger greater virological response than IFN treatment alone (Henry et al., 2006; Inoue et al., 2003). As CsA has known immune suppressive function, non-immunosuppressive cyclophilin inhibitors have been tried in combination with ribavirin for MERS-CoV infection. Though these have an in vitro effect on MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, this did not translate into a benefit in a mouse model (de Wilde et al., 2017). Here, we report the individual and combined effects of CsA and IFN-\u03b11 on inhibiting MERS-CoV replication in an in vitro and human lung and bronchus ex vivo explant culture model. We found the combined use of CsA and IFN-\u03b11 had inhibitory effects on MERS-CoV infection and replication, as well as on the induction of interferon stimulated genes (ISG), which sheds light on the potential use of this combination in curing MERS-CoV infection.",

Ex vivo infections of human bronchus and lungs was performed as previously published (Chan et al., 2013, 2014). In brief, the bronchial mucosae were placed on a surgical sponge with their apical epithelial surface facing upwards while the lung parenchymal tissues were placed into 24 well-plates directly with 1 ml of culture medium at 37 \u00b0C. Human betacoronavirus of lineage C virus (HCoV-EMC) was provided by R. Fouchier, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, the Netherlands, and used as the prototype MERS-CoV for examining the efficacy of different treatments. Fresh bronchial and lung tissues were infected with HCoV-EMC with a viral titer of 106 TCID50/ml for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C and then washed with 5 ml of PBS at room temperature for three times to remove unbound virus. Fresh culture medium with a regimen of 9 \u03bcM cyclosporine A (Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation) and/or 2.4 \u00d7 104 U/ml of IFN alfacon-1 (Kadmon pharmaceuticals) was then added to the cultures, and the treatments were replenished in a 16-h interval. Supernatants from the infected cultures were collected at 1, 8, 24, 40 56 hpi and titrated for infectious virus using the TCID50 assay for HCoV-EMC. Increasing virus titers over time provided evidence of productive virus replication. Tissues were collected at 24, and 56 hpi for RNA extraction and fixation in 10% formalin for immunohistochemical staining of MERS-CoV nucleocapsid protein (NP) using an antibody provided by Dr. R. Baric, and cleaved caspase 3 (Cell Signaling Technology). Vero cells were incubated with alpha-interferon and/or cyclosporine, for determination of optimal inhibition before application to ex vivo samples (Supplementary Fig. 1).",

We then performed these experiments in primary human cells in addition to continuous cell-lines. Therefore, we used human lung microvascular endothelial cell (HMVEC-L) which has been associated with extra-pulmonary dissemination of HCoV-EMC, as HCoV-EMC does not replicate well in primary human alveolar epithelial cells in vitro and we have demonstrated that HCoV-EMC could infect lung endothelial cells in our previous study (Chan et al., 2013). Our data showed that HMVEC-L was highly susceptible to HCoV-EMC infection and the IFN-\u03b11 and CsA combined treatment group had the greatest impact on reducing HCoV-EMC replication (Fig. 6\nA). The treatment dosage was not cytotoxic to the cell we used (Supplementary Fig. 1B). In line with the virus replication data, we confirmed that the IFN-\u03b11 and CsA treated group was more potent at reducing HCoV-EMC NP expression than either IFN or CsA alone. STAT1 expression and phosphorylation were comparably increased in the IFN treated and combine IFN-\u03b11 and CsA treated groups (Fig. 6B). This suggested that the effect of the combined treatment was independent of the JAK-STAT pathway. We next examined the p38 MAPK and AKT/mTOR pathways (Fig. 6C). The phosphorylation level of p38 in the combined treatment group was the lowest, which was similar to the CsA treated group. On the contrary, phosphorylation level of AKT at the s473 was the lowest in the combined treatment group, and the phosphorylation level of mTOR were comparable among all groups (Fig. 6C). This indicated that the beneficial effects of combination therapy may not be linked to the AKT/mTOR translational control of ISGs.",

There are still no proven specific antiviral therapies for this disease. Despite the apparent benefit of interferon therapy in rhesus macaques and marmosets, interferon therapy has not translated into clinical benefit in clinical cases of MERS (reviewed in (Al-Tawfiq and Memish, 2017; Arabi et al., 2017). This may be in part related to the late presentation of patients compared to laboratory settings. The lack of a good experimental animal model has further hampered progress on antiviral therapies for MERS. Our ex vivo cultures of the human bronchus and lung provides an alternative and complementary option for investigating therapeutic agents but still have a limitation in severe CoV infection studies, because patients may present to a health care setting 5 or more days after exposure, which is currently beyond our ability to maintain the ex vivo tissues. In this study, we find that a combination of interferon with short term cyclosporine (Fig. 2) may be worthy of pursuit in a clinical trial setting. Previously, these drugs have been used singly but not in combination (de Wilde et al., 2013). The ex vivo cultures showed a significant decrease in virus replication when this combination treatment was used compared to single treatment and this was also reflected in the greater number of ISG upregulated, compared to mock or single treatments. This increase in ISG may thus dampen the potential immune suppressive effect of CsA if used as a single agent. The combined treatment of type I interferon with cyclosporine also mitigated the extent of apoptosis caused by HCoV-EMC in our study (Fig. 4). As different therapeutic modalities are considered for evaluation in clinical trials, we suggest that IFN and CsA combination therapy should be considered. A recent review has also noted the need to evaluate combination therapies (Al-Tawfiq and Memish, 2017).",

            "text": "CsA is a small molecule immunosuppressant while IFN-\u03b11 is an immuno-stimulating protein favoring cell conversion to an antiviral state. Since the mechanism underlying the increment of ISG by this combination is unclear, we tried to identify the possible mechanisms behind the higher induction levels of ISG in the combined treatment of type I IFN and CsA over the other treatment groups. In canonical type I IFN signaling, IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 activates the JAK-STAT pathway in which STAT1 is an essential member to form the ISGF3 complex, which binds to the ISRE and controls the ISG expression (Ivashkiv and Donlin, 2014). Since the activation level of STAT1 in the combined treatment was similar or even slightly lower than the IFN-\u03b1 treatment alone (Fig. 6A), we believe that the extra ISG induction could be the result of the other signaling cascades independent of the JAK-STAT signaling. Therefore, we tried to determine whether the combined treatment would have effects on the AKT/mTOR pathway, which in turn has translational controls on the ISGs (Kaur et al., 2008; Kroczynska et al., 2009; Saleiro et al., 2015). Our results showed that mTOR activation was not affected by the combined treatment; and the decreased phosphorylation level of AKT in the combined treatment group may be related to the other signaling cascades that linked to AKT, thereby it was not likely that AKT/mTOR was involved in the enhanced ISGs levels by the double treatment. Furthermore, we also examined the p38 MAPK activation level, which also linked to the ISRE separately (Platanias, 2005; Saleiro et al., 2015). From our results, HCoV-EMC induced p38 phosphorylation (Lim et al., 2016) was reduced due to the effect from CsA, which may contribute to the inhibition of MER-CoV replication levels, while this result did not match with the elevated ISG level. Therefore, it is likely that CsA and type I IFN combination therapy uses alternative pathways to enhance antiviral effect and in enhancing ISG induction by acting directly or indirectly on the ISRE (Supplementary Fig. 4).",
