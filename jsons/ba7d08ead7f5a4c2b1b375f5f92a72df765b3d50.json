The static (static polymer-polymer correlation length (mesh size), associates of crosslinks and PVP microchains) and dynamic (polymer chain relaxation rate, hydrodynamic polymer-polymer correlation length) structural elements were determined. The incorporation of titania nanoparticles into PVP hydrogel slightly increases the size of structural inhomogeneities (an increase in the static and dynamic polymer-polymer correlation length, the formation of associates of cross-links and PVP chains). Titania nanoparticles have an impact on the microstructure of the composite hydrogel and form associates with sizes from 0.5 to 2 lm attached to PVP hydrogel pore walls. The PVP and TN/PVP hydrogels show a high degree of water swelling. Moreover, the presence of titania nanoparticles in TN/PVP increases the number of water adsorption cycles compared to PVP hydrogel. The high swelling degree, bacteria-resistant and antimicrobial properties against Staphylococcus aureus allow considering NT/PVP hydrogels for medical applications as wound coatings.",

The toxicity of organic compounds and their solubility and diffusion in body tissues increase with the decrease in molar weight [8] . The materials obtained by ionizing irradiation of PVP and PEG [8] did not present a toxic effect. Therefore, the in vitro and in vivo evaluations suggested that these biomaterials could be safely used in contact with the skin for wound dressing management in the form of advanced bandages or for drug immobilization as transdermal therapeutic systems. PVP-based hydrogels have excellent transparency, biocompatibility, swelling capacity, ability to disperse different active compounds and have been applied as dressings for the treatment of wounds such as burns and skin ulceration [13] , drug delivery systems [14] , in protein release [15] , atopic dermatitis [16] , and skin regeneration [17, 18] .",

Therefore, titania nanoparticles insignificantly decrease the diffusion coefficient and increase the n H value compared to pure PVP gel.

Evidently, the kinetics of the second water adsorption cycle is more complex and can be described by the first-order kinetic model with different rate constants of water adsorption (swelling). Table 6 gives the ranges of applicability of the second-order kinetic equations and the rates constants. After the second adsorption cycle, PVP hydrogel has a higher equilibrium swelling degree compared to the first cycle (Fig. 12a, Table 6 ), a longer time being required to reach the equilibrium swelling degree in the second adsorption cycle (* 219 h). After the first water adsorption (swelling) cycle, the equilibrium swelling degree for PVP hydrogel was 3757%; after the second cycle, 11020% (Fig. 12a, b ). An increase in the number of water adsorption cycles for 0.25TN/PVP hydrogel results in an increase in the equilibrium swelling degree (Fig. 12b , Table 6 ): 3530% for the first cycle, 7052% for the second cycle, and 11108% for the third cycle. During During the second water desorption cycle, the drying of PVP hydrogel at room temperature occurs faster than in the first cycle (Fig. 12c) because the water content in the latter was * 3 times higher (Fig. 12a) . The maximum possible three-dimensional hydrogel network expansion was achieved due to an increase in the pore size as a result of a decrease in its rigidity. Apparently, there are changes in the polymer chain relaxation, which makes a certain contribution to the overall water adsorption kinetics, thereby resulting in the faster water desorption. It worth noting that during the first and second water desorption cycles, PVP hydrogels were dried to a smaller final weight compared to the weight of the initial gels (m 0 ) ( Table 6 ) and during different times (* 146 h for the first cycle and * 47 h for the second cycle). This is also associated with the changes in the polymer chain relaxation in the hydrogel. After the second water desorption cycle, PVP hydrogel completely degraded.",

The introduction of titania nanoparticles in PVP leads to a decrease in the water swelling degree of hydrogels air-dried to constant weight compared to the corresponding PVP; however, it leads to an increase in the operating life of hydrogel by one water adsorption cycle.

For these experiments, gel films of 4 mm nominal thickness and 3 9 4 cm cross section were used. Prior to the measurements, the gel samples were dried and then reswollen in excess D 2 O for at least 3 days at 22.0 \u00b1 0.1\u00b0C (SD)(Fig. 1). The swollen samples were placed in 4-mm-thick sandwich-type cells with quartz windows. The remaining space in the sample holder was filled with D 2 O to exclude air and avoid deswelling. Measurements were performed at 22.0 \u00b1 0.1\u00b0C in the transfer vector q range 0.042 \u00c5 -1 B q B 0.219 \u00c5 -1 , where q is the wavevector, k is the incident neutron wavelength (k = 0.6 nm), and h is the scattering angle. The Fourier time range was from 0.1 to 30 ns. The resolution functions of the instrument were determined for different experimental conditions using the elastic scattering of graphite. The NSE method directly measures the intermediate scattering function I(q,s) as a function of q and the Fourier time s, i.e., it directly yields the time dependence of the densitydensity autocorrelation function[35]. The resulting intermediate scattering functions were corrected for the D 2 O background dynamics.",
