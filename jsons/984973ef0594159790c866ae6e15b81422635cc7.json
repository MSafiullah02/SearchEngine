This study examined the cytostatic and antiviral activity of twelve methyl-2-arylidene hydrazinecarbodithioates reported by many researchers as intermediates for the synthesis of thiosemicarbazides and the preparation of their metal complexes. Compounds IIc, IIi, and IIl with tridentate ligand features were found to have the lowest IC50 value (6.5 \u00b5M, \u2248 1 \u00b5M, and 0.8 \u00b5M, respectively) against HL60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells. They were also most inhibitory to human embryonic lung (HEL) fibroblast proliferation (5.3 \u00b5M, 17 \u00b5M, and 2.6 \u00b5M). Compound IIc and IIl show antiviral activity against wild-type herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella zoster virus (VZV), and acyclovirresistant HSV; however, these activities were observed at concentrations at which the compounds also markedly inhibit HL60 and HEL cell proliferation.",

            "text": "Many N-substituted thiosemicarbazones were prepared by the condensation of Schiff's bases of methyl-2-arylidene hydrazinecarbodithioate (MAHCD) with amines (Casero et al., 1980; Collins et al., 1982; Klayman et al., 1979 Klayman et al., , 1991 Scovill et al., 1982; Shipman et al., 1981) . While thiosemicarbazones and their metal complexes were studied for their biological activity (Beraldo & Gambinob, 2004; Ettari et al., 2010; Jiang et al., 2006; Katz, 1987; Liberta & West, 1992; Matesanz & Souza, 2009; Pandeya & Dimmock, 1993; Wnuk & Robins, 2006; Yu et al., 2009) , the intermediate MAHCD was rarely studied for its metal complexation behaviour and the complexes for their biological activity (Ali et al., 2002; Kanwar et al., *Corresponding author, e-mail: venkatesanj@bitmesra.ac.in 2008; Neelam et al., 2000; Saxena & Tandon, 1983; Singh et al., 1997) . Very few investigators have reported biological activity of compounds with a dithiocarbamate side chain (Cao et al., 2005; Huang et al., 2009; Kumar et al., 2010) . It is interesting to note that MAHCD shares structural similarity with Schiff's bases of N-hydroxy semicarbazides (SNHS) and Nhydroxy aminoguanidines (SNHAG) (Fig. 1) . Both SNHS and SNHAG were rigorously documented for their anticancer activity and antiviral properties. It was proposed that these compounds act by inhibiting ribonucleotide reductase (RR) through metal chelation (Das et al., 1999; Ren et al., 2002; T'ang et al., 1985) . With this background, twelve MAHCD derivatives were synthesised and evaluated for anticancer activity against HL60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells and antiviral activity against a panel of viral cell lines.",
