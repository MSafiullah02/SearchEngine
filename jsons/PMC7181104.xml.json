Besides the planning of intensive care resources, the lack of evidence-based therapy options is a particular problem for the treating physicians. General statements on the typical course of SARS-CoV\u20112 infection cannot be made reliably at present. Disease patterns are unspecific, diverse, and vary widely, from asymptomatic courses to severe complications, such as pneumonia with lung failure, cardiovascular and cerebral manifestations, and ultimately death. Symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath as well as neurological and cardiac manifestations [1]. Risk groups are mainly older people (with a steadily increasing risk of severe courses from above 50\u201360 years of age), smokers, and patients with certain pre-existing conditions (e.g., cardiovascular diseases, lung diseases, diabetes mellitus, cancer, and weakened immune system [2, 3]). Therefore, standardized and coordinated data collection on a large scale is of pivotal importance to learn about the natural course of the disease, to accelerate knowledge on the role of pre-existing comorbidities in the COVID-19 pandemic, and to identify factors associated with outcomes.",

V.) or in patients with renal diseases (DGfN\u2014Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Nephrologie).

Both LEOSS and CAPACITY-COVID have received support by national and international professional organizations; the CAPACITY-COVID registry was started in The Netherlands and recently endorsed by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) for international enrolment. Study designs, objectives, and planned outcome analyses are summarized in Table 1. The expert committees of COVID-19-RLP, LEOSS, and CAPACITY-COVID have exchanged their codebooks to ensure consistency and comparability of data collection. Data collection of the ongoing activities is an extension of the Case Record Form (CRF) that was released by the ISARIC (International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium) and the WHO for data collection in the COVID-19 pandemic, ensuring comparability of data but focusing on specific aspects of the disease. Due to the prospective design of COVID-19-RLP and CAPACITY-COVID with patients\u2019 informed consent both registries have planned short- and mid-term follow-ups of the enrolled patients (Table 1).",

Target variables are the clinical status at admission, pre-existing conditions, laboratory parameters, therapeutic strategies, and the course of the disease. The primary objectives are (a) to characterize patients with SARS-CoV\u20112 infection requiring in-hospital treatment in Rhineland-Palatinate, (b) to describe the current therapeutic strategies, (c) to document the complications (with a special focus on cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events) and mortality of SARS-CoV\u20112 infection, and (d) to develop a risk stratification for severe disease progression, which could potentially contribute to a prediction of the need for ventilation and thus to better planning of resources. The study is supported by the Ministry of Social Affairs, Labor, Health, and Demography of Rhineland-Palatinate and conducted in accordance with the World Medical Association\u2014Declaration of Helsinki\u2014Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects and approved by the ethics committee of the Landes\u00e4rztekammer Rheinland-Pfalz. The study is registered at ClincialTrials.gov (NCT04335188). Eligible for enrolment are all patients with confirmed SARS-CoV\u20112 infection undergoing in-hospital treatment. A total of 84 hospitals in Rhineland-Palatinate in Germany treating patients with SARS-CoV\u20112 infection are eligible for participation and have started enrolment on April 6, 2020. All data collected are web-based using the software solution EBogen\u00a9. During documentation, plausibility and completeness checks are generated immediately. All data are transferred with SSL encryption standard and stored on a server of the Institut f\u00fcr Herzinfarktforschung Ludwigshafen (IHF). Descriptive statistics on the registry population, the applied therapeutic measures, and the clinical course will be generated. Subgroup analyses for risk stratification are planned and defined in a detailed statistical analysis plan.",

Scientific collaborations are already planned and should be continued to ensure data consistency and comparability. We look forward to obtaining additional data on the short- and mid-term course of the disease with prospective follow-ups of hospital survivors in the COVID-19-RLP as well as in the CAPACITY-COVID registries with specific focus on cardiovascular and neurological outcomes. COVID-19-RLP in addition will also collect data on the yet-unknown consequences for mental health and the psychosocial outcomes of survivors of COVID-19.",
