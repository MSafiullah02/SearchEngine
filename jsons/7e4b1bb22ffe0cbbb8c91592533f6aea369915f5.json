In addition, transmission of disease is also dependent on virulence of the pathogen and whether other infectious disease processes are already ongoing in the exposed individual. The evolution of successful pathogens seems remarkable in the face of what we know about mammalian immune systems after decades of intense investigation. However, pathogens in general and viral pathogens in particular rapidly mutate and evolve to counteract the non-specific, innate responses of mammals and the highly specific adaptive immune response.",

Because viruses rely on the host for growth, survival, and transmission, they have evolved diverse methods to escape elimination by the host's immune system. Generally, this is referred to as immune evasion, and the simple reason for a virus to evade the host's protective mechanisms is to acquire time for replication and transmission of progeny to other cells or hosts or to hide from surveillance by the immune system in a latent state. A large body of literature now exists on the main mechanisms engaged by viruses to evade the immune system. Immune evasion can be achieved by the interruption of various host responses including the innate response, cellular responses, humoral responses, and inhibition of immune effector molecules (1) . The result of immune evasion is clinical disease or infection that is protracted over time.",

Eliminating the possibility of recognizing viral epitopes presented in context of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules is common during infection by successful viral pathogens (2) (3) (4) (5) . To evade humoral immunity, viruses may undergo antigenic variation or encode proteins that induce polyclonal activation of B cells, leading to hyperproduction of immunoglobulins (Igs) not necessarily protective against the virus (6, 7) . Other viruses encode highly glycosylated envelope proteins such that the glycosylation can mask the neutralizing epitopes, thus rendering the antibody response ineffective (8, 9) . In some infections, viral proteins have been shown to inhibit complement-mediated killing of infected cells (10) or target effector molecules by encoding either homologous cytokines or cytokine receptors, having acquired such genes through modification or capturing of host cellular genes (11) (12) (13) .",

However, other mouse 'models' have been reported extensively where disease pathology does not have any relationship to the pathology in the host of interest. A clear example in livestock is vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), which does not cause vesicles at all in mice but rather causes encephalitis. Contrarily, this virus gains its name from the natural disease pathology in cattle, horses, and swine, which is characterized by vesicular lesions on the lips, tongue, snout, and coronary bands of the feet (15) . Similarly, rodents are a poor model for foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) infection, as infection of mice requires high doses of virus and there is no clinical vesicular disease.",

The role of important innate cell populations has been a focus of recent research efforts, and many aspects of the response of these cell types have been studied. A comprehensive understanding of the innate response to viral infection still requires a great deal more investigation, as knowledge of the relationship of this virus and the infected cell is extensive but not yet comprehensive. By contrast, information on the immunopathology of FMDV in infected animals is sparse, though recently there has been more activity on this subject. Here, we endeavor to inform about current knowledge as well as identify areas lacking in information and understanding. Understanding FMDV immunopathology in vivo remains a very high priority, given an outbreak of FMDV in North America is anticipated to cause losses in the billions of dollars to the economies of Mexico, Canada, and the United States.",

Infected cells display viral glycoproteins on the plasma membrane, but in the presence of virusspecific antibodies, redistribution of viral glycoproteins on the cell surface occurs, which leads to their aggregation, capping, and finally shedding. Further, when infected monocytes are incubated with glycoprotein-specific antibodies, viral glycoproteins are endocytosed. In both cases, the result is no display of viral proteins on the cell surface membrane of infected cells, rendering such cells invisible to CTLs. This is particularly important for glycoproteins B and D (19, 20) . Likely, PrV subverts the antibody response phase of infection until it establishes latency.

A positive strand RNA virus, FMDV rapidly mutates in the course of an outbreak of infection, creating quasi species within the broader serotype (32) . This virus also induces a highly acute infection, with clinical disease developing rapidly after exposure and a high level of viremia early in infection. Fever and viremia last only 1 or 2 days, and lesions normally resolve rapidly, in 7-10 days. In a small percentage of cases, a carrier state can develop lasting more than a few months, and this is often associated with exposure of vaccinated cattle to virulent virus (33, 34) .",

Infected cells therefore have mostly viral protein synthesis and little cellular proteins translated (37, 38) . This is likely to have a significant effect on inducing immune responses, as infected cells have been shown to lose class I MHC expression. With no new protein synthesis, these effects likely lead to no viral protein peptides getting loaded into newly synthesized MHC molecules via the endogenous pathway, and therefore, no induction of a CD8 1 T-cell response can occur.

The bulk of knowledge in this area has been obtained by using a serotype A virus derived from an infectious clone (A12) that has the leader protease removed (LLA12). Deletion of Lpro in the LLA12 virus results in a highly attenuated virus that fails to replicate in otherwise susceptible primary cell lines (39) . In addition, infection of animals with the LLA12 virus rarely causes viremia, and lesions are restricted to the inoculation sites, resulting in the rapid clearance of the virus before induction of neutralizing antibodies (42, 43) . However both the wildtype virus and the LLA12 replicate to almost the same degree in BHK-21 cells or in suckling mice (44) due to defects in type 1 IFN response machinery in these systems (45, 46) . Furthermore, supernatants from LLA12-infected porcine or bovine fibroblasts had a stronger type 1 IFN-mediated antiviral activity relative to those from wildtype infection (40) . These data indicate that Lpro contributes to the virulence of FMDV and plays a significant role in suppressing the innate immune response to this virus, permitting replication and transmission between susceptible species.",

NF-kB is a ubiquitous protein that regulates genes (including IFNb) responsible for innate and adaptive immunity. Inactive NF-kB is found in the cytoplasm coupled to an inhibitory protein, IkB. Viral infections and other stressors induce a signaling cascade via pathogen-associated molecular pattern receptors leading to the activation of NF-kB (47) . Activated NF-kB translocates to the nucleus, where it mediates gene transcription. Infection of BHK-21 cells with FMDV wildtype or LLA12 results in translocation of NF-kB into the nucleus (48) . However, at later stages of the infection, there is degradation of the nuclear NF-kB in wildtype infected cells but not in the LLA12 infected cells. The degradation of NF-kB correlates with translocation of FMDV Lpro into the nucleus. Furthermore, NF-kB degradation is observed when Lpro is introduced into the cells in the absence of other FMDV proteins (48) . Thus, degradation of NF-kB by FMDV Lpro might be another mechanism by which FMDV mediates the downregulation of inflammatory gene transcription and hence inhibition of innate immunity.",

Similarly, multiple strains of FMDV have been shown to cause lymphopenia in swine involving multiple subsets of peripheral lymphocytes (57, 58, Nfon et al., manuscript submitted). This lymphopenia is characterized by a decline in the absolute numbers as well as percentage of lymphocytes in peripheral blood and closely correlates with peaks of viremia. The more virulent strains for pig (O1 Campos, O Taiwan 97, A24 Cruzeiro, C3 Resende, and Cs8C1) induce more profound lymphopenia compared with the less virulent strains (O-SK2000 and A12), inducing mild and delayed lymphopenia. Active infection of lymphocytes is not responsible for the lymphopenia, as virus could not be recovered from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of infected pigs despite high viremia. In addition, PBMCs were not infected in vitro (59, 60) . However, a plaque purified, tissue culture strain of serotype C, Cs8C1, inoculated into young pigs has been reported to infect lymphocytes (58) . There is no significant increase in apoptosis of peripheral and tissue lymphocytes, and the recovery from lymphopenia is usually rapid.",

Early after infection (48 h), all swine had detectable IFNa in serum regardless of virus serotype and strain used to infect. Peak levels of serum IFNa ranged from 200 to 1500 pg/ml on day 3 post-infection and dropped sharply to background levels by days 4-10 (Nfon et al., manuscript submitted). IFNa protects swine from FMDV infection when administered 24-48 h before challenge (61, 62) . IFNa may contribute to early clearance of viremia by preventing further propagation of virus in susceptible cells (42) . Despite this activity, FMDV replicates rapidly and attains peak viremia within 48-72 h of infection. This observation suggests a potential for swine to mount an innate response to FMDV that is insufficient to stop the early establishment of infection but plays a significant role in viral clearance. For instance, IFNa secretion may activate cells mediating an innate response and/or induce an antiviral state in susceptible tissue, although not in time to completely block infection. Either of these possibilities is consistent with published data analyzing exogenous delivery of IFNa (61) .",

Similarly, our observation of peak serum IFNa in porcine FMDV infection coincided with lowest lymphocyte numbers in blood. Thus, the serum IFNa response could partly account for the FMDV-associated lymphopenia in pigs. The connection between serum IFNa and lymphopenia has been clearly demonstrated in mice. Mice injected with poly I:C exhibit a lymphopenia linked to their serum IFNa levels (63) . Studies in gene-targeted mice show that infection with VSV is associated with lymphopenia, which is dependent on signaling through the type 1 IFN receptor (IFNaR) (64). Kamphuis et al. (64) , using adoptive transfer studies in mice with a B-or T-cell-specific IFNaR deletion, showed that IFNa/b exerted a direct effect on lymphocytes sufficient to induce lymphopenia.",

DCs previously described in swine peripheral blood include myeloid/ monocyte-derived DCs (MoDCs) (65-67) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) (68) . pDCs are specialized IFNa-secreting cells and produce large amounts of this cytokine in response to many viral infections.

No live virus was isolated from monocytes (including DCs and macrophages) of FMDV-infected swine, despite the presence of high titers of virus in blood. Furthermore, immune serum is required for an abortive infection of monocytes in vitro (79) . Similarly, we found no evidence of productive infection of LCs in vitro and from LCs isolated from infected swine despite the high susceptibility of surrounding keratinocytes (59, 60) . Viral products and replication intermediates released by lysed, infected cells and taken up by DCs may account for this immunosuppression. However, viral RNA can be detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of RNA samples isolated from in vitro exposed LCs after 1 h adsorption, indicating that FMDV can bind to and be internalized by LCs (59) . Indeed, by immunohistochemistry, Gregg et al. (80) detected low levels of FMDV antigen within LCs. Because FMDV is a positive sense RNA virus, viral protein synthesis can be initiated upon uptake and before virus inactivation. Thus, low levels of viral proteins, particularly the rapidly translated, self-cleaving Lpro, may occur within DCs even in the absence of replication.",

These functions are regulated by NK cell-activating cytokines such as IL-2, IL-12, IL-15, IL-18, and IFNs (81) . Apart from cytokines, NK cells express activating receptors, such as NKp30, NKp44, and NKp46, in humans. Binding of these receptors signals activation of the NK cell.

Most studies on how NK cells are affected by infection have been performed on viruses that are persistent or chronic in nature, although acute infections may also lead to dysfunction of NK cells (reviewed in 83). In fact, during porcine infection with FMDV, this may be the case. Pig peripheral blood NK cells are rather quiescent in nature and only increase their cytotoxicity after stimulation with NK cell-activating cytokines, such as IL-15 (84, Toka et al., manuscript submitted). Peripheral blood NK cells from FMDV serotype O-infected pigs do not increase their cytotoxicity, as opposed to the responses of these cells in infections such as MCVM in the mouse (85, 86) . Instead, the swine NK cell response declines beginning from the second or third day after FMDV infection. Such a state of dysfunction usually lasts for 2-3 days, after which reactivity returns to background levels. Higher viral titers in the serum of infected animals appear to coincide with the reduction in NK cell cytotoxicity. Curiously, when the effector protein expression such as perforin was compared in infected cells and non-infected cells, there was only a marginal difference (Toka et al., manuscript submitted). This observation may indicate that while the granzyme/perforin killing mechanism may be intact, other pathways are possibly modulated by FMDV resulting in reduced antiviral activity of NK cells. However, intracellular expression of IFNg was inhibited, which may largely contribute the inactive status of NK cells during FMDV infection. Inhibition of cytokines or chemokines is one of the strategies used by viruses to subvert the immune system. These processes take place in non-infected cells, requiring that the mechanism of this inhibition likely involves products, cellular or viral, from infected cells.",

Such is the case when CD81 directly binds E2 of hepatitis C virus (87) . If such interaction occurs early in infection, the costimulatory effect of NK cells on DCs will be hampered, and as a result, DC-dependent activation of NK cell lytic activity. Commonly, NK cells recognize infected cells by virally induced lack of MHC expression; however, some viral proteins may upregulate expression of MHC class I molecules in infected cells, inhibiting NK function. Furthermore, viruses can interrupt NK receptor-mediated recognition of cells infected with virus by blocking cell-activating cytokines such as IFNa, IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18.",

Of the three NK cell receptors (NCRs), only NCR3 is upregulated, at least in the first 3 days after infection, followed by GZMB, KLRC1, and KLRA1. The remaining genes, such as NCR1, KLRF1, GZMA, KLRB1, KLRK1, SH2DIB, and PRF1 are not upregulated, suggesting that there may be selective inhibition of expression of these genes during infection with FMDV (Toka et al., manuscript submitted).",

This finding suggests that these DCs retain the ability to process and present FMDV antigen, thus initiating the strong antibody response extensively reported in FMDV infection of swine (36) .

Using polyclonal anti-swine IgG antiserum, the IgG response is detectable around 14 days after infection and lasts for months.

Th1 is characterized in all species by production of IFNg, and Th2 cells are a prominent source of IL4, IL-5, and IL-13 following stimulation. In swine, analysis of the association of specific Ig responses with Th1 or Th2 T cells is not possible, given only two antibodies are presently available, anti-IgG1 and anti-IgG2. However, we have previously reported a reduced T-cell proliferation and lack of IFNg secretion in response to mitogen during acute FMDV infection (57) . Interestingly, when the antibody response to FMDV was analyzed using these limited reagents, we detected a putative IgG1 antibody reactivity with FMDV but no IgG2 antiviral reactivity. Porcine IgG2 antibody reactivity with a standard protein antigen, chicken ovalbumin, was readily detected (W. Golde, unpublished data).
