During virus infection, host factors trigger an immune response against the virus. However, it should be noted that immunopathogenesis is associated with an immune response out of control, which may result in pulmonary tissue damage, functional impairment, and reduced lung capacity. Chemotactic factors are essential to the immune responses against the virus infections, given their regulatory effect on dilations and positions of leukocytes in the host lungs. Therefore, spectral changes in chemotactic factors may lead to severely maladjusted immune responses. Immune insufficiency or misdirection may increase viral replication and cause tissue damages. In contrast, overactive immune responses may induce immunopathological conditions. In this review article, we provide an analysis of the role of cytokines secreted upon CoV infections and their potentially detrimental contribution to the damages of the respiratory tract and other tissues.",

It mainly activates the transcription factors NF\u2010kB and mitogen\u2010activated protein kinases (MAPKs) pathways to induce inflammatory factors' expression.\n6\n Unlike MyD88, TRIF is an adapter protein of TLR3 and TLR4, which activates the transcription factors IRF3 and NF\u2010kB to induce the expression of type I interferon and immune\u2010inflammatory factors. The function of TRAM and TIRAP is to recruit TRIF molecules to the TLR4 receptor and MyD88 to the TLR2 and TLR4 receptors. Therefore, the TLR signaling pathways are classified as the MyD88\u2010dependent pathway, which functions to activate immune\u2010inflammatory factors, and the TRIF\u2010dependent pathway, which functions to activate the type I interferons and inflammatory factors.\n6\n After a TLR is activated by the corresponding PAMP, MyD88 recruits the busy\u20101 receptor\u2010related kinases IRAK4, IRAKI, IRAK2, and IRAK\u2010M. IRAK4 plays an important role in activating NF\u2010kB and MAPKs downstream of MyD88. IRAK interacts with TRAF6, which causes its K\u201063 ubiquitination, and facilitates NEMO ubiquitination to activate NF\u2010kB. TRIF\u2010dependent pathways activate IRF3 and NF\u2010kB.\n8\n, \n9\n In addition to activating NF\u2010kB, TRIF\u2010dependent pathways, they also activate IRF3 and interferon\u2010\u03b2.\n10\n, \n11\n\n",

All these viruses belong to the subfamily Coronavirinae in the family Coronaviridae. Since CoVs emerge periodically and unpredictably, spread rapidly, and induce serious infectious diseases, they become a continuous threat to human health. This is especially true when there are no approved vaccines or drugs for the treatment of CoV infections and there exists a range of animal reservoirs for CoVs and recombinant CoVs. In recent years, profound understandings of the innate immune response to viruses have been made. This type of immune response inhibits virus replication, promotes virus clearance, induces tissue repair, and triggers a prolonged adaptive immune response against the viruses. In most cases, pulmonary and systemic inflammatory responses associated with CoVs are triggered by the innate immune system when it recognizes the viruses. Although a broadly protective, universal vaccine is considered the ultimate protection against the virus spread, vaccine development can be time\u2010consuming. To fulfill the pressing need, we should propose effective therapeutic measures using the accumulated knowledge of the innate immune response system. Targeted immunotherapy is a good alternative to some antivirals that have narrow treatment windows and meet with drug resistance easily. In 2003, glucocorticoid was widely used in SARS treatment to control pulmonary infection by regulating inflammatory responses. Except for viral pathogenicity, the inflammatory response of the body also plays a crucial role in SARS\u2010induced lung injury cases. Therefore, in CoV pneumonia cases, it is important to control cytokine production and inflammatory response, given that they are responsible for the accumulation of cells and fluids. This strategy is challenging as we have not yet clearly identified any features in an immune response that can be inhibited specifically without compromising the beneficial host defense.",

A, CoV infects macrophages, and then macrophages present CoV antigens to T cells. This process leads to T cell activation and differentiation, including the production of cytokines associated with the different T cell subsets (ie, Th17), followed by a massive release of cytokines for immune response amplification. The continued production of these mediators due to viral persistence has a negative effect on NK, and CD8 T cell activation. However, CD8 T cells produce very effective mediators to clear CoV. B, Attachment of CoV to DPP4R on the host cell through S protein leads to the appearance of genomic RNA in the cytoplasm. An immune response to dsRNA can be partially generated during CoV replication. TLR\u20103 sensitized by dsRNA and cascades of signaling pathways (IRFs and NF\u2010\u03baB activation, respectively) are activated to produce type I IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines. The production of type I IFNs is important to enhance the release of antiviral proteins for the protection of uninfected cells. Sometimes, accessory proteins of CoV can interfere with TLR\u20103 signaling and bind the dsRNA of CoV during replication to prevent TLR\u20103 activation and evade the immune response. TLR\u20104 might recognize S protein and lead to the activation of proinflammatory cytokines through the MyD88\u2010dependent signaling pathway.
