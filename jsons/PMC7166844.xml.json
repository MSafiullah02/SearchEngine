            "text": "Hepatitis C virus is an important human pathogen, which causes chronic infection in at least 170 million people world\u2010wide. Up to 85% of acutely infected patients become carriers of the virus and develop CHC, which can advance to cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma in up to 20% of patients [1]. HCV is a positive single\u2010stranded RNA virus that replicates by making the so\u2010called \u2018negative strand\u2019. Although HCV is highly hepatotropic, evidences indicate that it also propagates in the lymphatic [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] and nervous [9, 10] systems. In regard to the lymphatic system, circulating PBMC from patients with CHC [2, 3, 4, 5] and from individuals with apparent complete resolution of hepatitis C, who were serum HCV RNA nonreactive by standard laboratory assays and had normal liver enzymes, have been shown to carry replicating HCV genomes [5, 6, 7, 8]. Low levels of HCV RNA have also been detected in lymphoid cells in a significant proportion of patients with persistently elevated liver enzymes of unknown aetiology [11, 12]. Furthermore, susceptibility of T\u2010 and B\u2010cell lines, as well as primary human T cells and monocyte/macrophages to HCV infection has also been shown [13, 14, 15, 16]. It is thought that by invading the immune system, HCV can conceal its presence and enhance the likelihood of persistence, as it has been observed in many other long\u2010term viral infections [17, 18].",

This therapy results in the so\u2010called SVR in no more than 50% of patients [19]. The SVR is defined as serum HCV RNA negativity for at least 6 months after completion of treatment, as determined by clinical laboratory RT\u2010PCR assays with the current sensitivities between 50 and 3200 virus genome (copies) equivalents [vge]/mL or 50\u2013615 IU/mL [20]. Clinically, individuals with SVR and normal liver function tests have been considered to be free of HCV. However, it has recently been documented that by employing more sensitive RT\u2010PCR detection methods, identifying <10 HCV copies or <5 IU/mL, the virus can be consistently found in sera, lymphoid cells and hepatic tissue for years after the apparent complete recovery from hepatitis C [5, 6, 8, 21, 22, 23]. In addition, liver biopsies from these individuals occasionally reveal histological evidence of protracted minor inflammation, frequently mild\u2010to\u2010moderate fibrosis or in rare cases, even active chronic hepatitis [21, 22, 24].",

It became evident that such an approach facilitates a more accurate detection of HCV than by testing sera or naive PBMC. This finding also reaffirmed the notion that lymphotropism is an intrinsic property of HCV. Nevertheless, it remained unknown whether HCV replication is universally upregulated following stimulation of lymphoid cells or is augmented only in specific situations dictated by not as yet determined viral or cellular factors. Investigation of this issue is important to not only better understand HCV\u2010lymphoid cell interactions, but also to assess whether testing of ex vivo stimulated lymphoid cells can be suitable for routine diagnosis of occult HCV infection.",

Importantly, HCV replication in lymphoid cells during occult infection was inversely proportional to the level of transcription of IFN\u03b1. Moreover, sequence analysis of HCV clones derived from lymphoid cells and serum collected in the course of occult infection suggested lymphoid cell\u2010specific compartmentalization of viral variants providing further evidence for the existence of active viral replication in the host's immune system after apparently complete resolution of hepatitis C.",

As illustrated in Fig. 2, consistent single nucleotide differences at specific positions were detected between serum and PBMC obtained at the same time point of follow\u2010up, as well as between serum and PBMC collected from the same individual at the two occasions. For example, while a guanidine at position 186 (G186) and an adenine at positions 192 (A192) and 231 (A231) were detected in all the clones derived from Serum\u20102 of Case 19, a thymidine (T186), cytosine (C192), and guanidine (G231), respectively, were found in the clones from PBMC\u20102 sample. In Case 20, two single nucleotide polymorphisms T186G and C192A were identified when HCV clones from Serum\u20101 were compared with those from PBMC\u20101. Interestingly, sequences of HCV detected in Serum\u20102 obtained 1 year later from this individual, except for a few random mutations in some of the clones, were identical to those found in PBMC\u20101 sample. Further, when sequences obtained from PBMC\u20102 were compared with those of Serum\u20102, three substitutions G186T, A192T and A231G were detected in all of the clones examined (Fig. 2). In addition, there were changes in the 5\u2032\u2010UTR sequence when serum or PBMC from the first collection was compared with those obtained at the second collection. Specifically, relative to the sequences found in the respective samples from the first collection, T186G and C192A mutations were identified in the second serum sample, while G186T, A192T and A231G substitutions found in the second PBMC. Overall, these findings revealed the existence of minor but evident variations between the circulating virus and that residing in the PBMC. They also showed that over time the 5\u2032\u2010UTR sequence underwent slight but clearly identifiable changes.",

            "text": "In our previous study, synergistic stimulation of T and B lymphocytes with appropriate mitogens augmented HCV replication leading to more frequent identification of the virus genome compared with PBMC treated with a single mitogen [5]. In the present work, to further increase likelihood of identification of HCV, viral RNA was examined after exposure of both lymphocytes and monocytes to mitogen cocktails. Thus, the second PBMC samples were treated with either C5, which activated T and B cells, or C5L, which also stimulated monocytes and macrophages. Both treatments led to enhanced expression of HCV RNA\u2010positive strand, despite the fact that some of these samples were apparently HCV RNA\u2010negative or carried very low HCV loads prior to mitogen stimulation, as illustrated in Fig. 3a and Table 1. It is of note that, considering densitometric values given by the respective hybridization signals, C5L was at least twice more effective in upregulating HCV RNA expression than C5 (Fig. 3a). The fact that C5L, but not C5, led to identification of viral RNA in PBMC from Patients 6 and 7 (Fig. 3a) suggested that monocytes were a predominant, if not the only reservoir of the persisting virus among circulating PBMC in these two individuals at the time of investigation. However, the synergistic activation of lymphocytes and monocytes occasionally led to almost complete inhibition of HCV RNA expression. This was evident in Patients 11 and 12 (Table 1) in which HCV RNA expression was increased by 20\u2013100\u2010fold following stimulation of T and B lymphocytes with C5, while activation of both lymphocytes and monocytes with C5L resulted in a dramatic downregulation of HCV RNA presence. This observation implied that ex vivo treatments of lymphoid cells with both C5 and C5L were required to more accurately identify the existence of occult HCV infection.",

When these cells were exposed to C5 or C5L, a dramatic decrease in HCV RNA expression was detected (Fig.  4). Specifically, while a nearly 90% reduction in the expression of HCV RNA positive strand was found in Case 18, as determined by densitometric analysis, a complete inhibition of the same strand was evident in Case 19, regardless of whether the cells had been treated with C5 or C5L (Fig. 4a). In Case 20, the level of HCV RNA positive strand was decreased by about 10% after C5 treatment, but became undetectable following the treatment with C5L (Fig. 4a). In all three cases, the drastic depletion of the HCV positive strand appeared to be a direct result of abrogation of HCV replication, as reflected by a concomitant inhibition of the viral RNA negative strand expression (Fig. 4b). Comparable levels of GAPDH mRNA detected in both untreated and mitogen\u2010treated cells (Fig. 4c) ruled out the possibility of unequal sample loading or that the treatment with mitogens might have been cytotoxic.",

For this purpose, the transcriptional activity of IFN\u03b15, IFN\u03b3, TNF\u03b1 and MxA, an intracellular indicator of interferon activation [28], were examined whenever material permitted in both naive and mitogen\u2010treated PBMC from randomly selected cases in Groups 1 and 2a, as well as from all 3 patients in Group 2b (Table 1). In the preceding experiments, it was established that the levels of IFN5\u03b1 mRNA in unstimulated human lymphoid cells were too low to be accurately measured by real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR. Therefore, a more sensitive RT\u2010PCR/NAH assay was employed to evaluate the level of this cytokine mRNA, while IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 mRNAs were quantified by real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR. As depicted in Fig. 5a, lymphoid cells with initially undetectable or low HCV loads obtained from Cases 6 and 13, respectively (Table 1), which had exhibited augmented virus replication following treatment with C5L (Fig. 3), showed a decrease in the expression of IFN5\u03b1 to a virtually nondetectable level after mitogen treatment. Interestingly, transcription of IFN5\u03b1 in the cells from a CHC patient (CHC\u20102), which carried <200 vge/\u03bcg total cellular RNA and had shown increased HCV RNA expression following mitogen stimulation (Fig. 3), was also inhibited. Conversely, transcription of the IFN\u03b15 gene was evidently augmented in lymphoid cells from Cases 18 and 19 after treatment with C5 or C5L (Fig. 5). Intriguingly, these cells carried initially high HCV loads but the viral replication was completely or nearly completely abrogated after their exposure to the mitogens (Fig. 4). In sharp contrast, we found no association between the levels of IFN\u03b3 mRNA or TNF\u03b1 mRNA and the rate of HCV replication in lymphoid cells (data not shown).",

            "text": "In our previous studies, persistence of low levels of HCV RNA in individuals followed for years after they had been considered cured of hepatitis C, based on the results of standard laboratory assays for HCV RNA and normal liver function tests, was documented [5, 6]. Similar findings were subsequently reported by other groups by examining both lymphoid cells [7, 8, 21] and liver tissue fragments [8, 21, 22]. In this clinically silent form of HCV persistence, T and B lymphocytes were found to carry replicating HCV genomes [5]. In the present study, it has been demonstrated that cells of the monocytic lineage also are a reservoir of HCV replication in occult infection. This finding is consistent with a recent observation made in another laboratory [21], which showed the presence of HCV RNA in cultured monocytes from individuals with resolved hepatitis C. The current study, for the first time, documents the existence of a reverse relation between HCV load and expression of IFN\u03b1 in lymphoid cells in the course of occult HCV infection. In addition, it was found that the level of HCV RNA in naive lymphoid cells during occult persistence is a predictor of whether ex vivo stimulation will enhance or abrogate viral replication in these cells. Specifically, when the level of HCV RNA in naive circulating lymphoid cells is equal to or >103 vge/\u03bcg total RNA (10\u201315 \u03bcg of RNA is typically recovered from 1 \u00d7 107 lymphoid cells), stimulation of the cells leads to drastic inhibition in HCV replication. However, under the same treatment conditions, augmentation of HCV replication is usually observed in cells carrying around 5\u201350 vge/\u03bcg total RNA. Subsequent analysis showed that the level of IFN\u03b1 transcription, but not that of IFN\u03b3 or TNF\u03b1, is relevant to the control of HCV replication in lymphoid cells during occult infection.",

Importantly, HCV RNA replicative intermediate was identified in approximately 65% of the lymphoid cell samples positive for the HCV negative strand. Heterogeneity in viral sequences detected in serum and PBMC samples, collected at the same or at two different occasions from the same individuals, provided additional evidence for persistently progressing viral replication in lymphoid cells.",

In fact, PBMC treated with C5L showed higher levels of HCV RNA expression than those treated with C5 in a significant number of cases examined. The contribution of HCV residing in monocytes to the viral load identified in the total PBMC population was most pronounced in four individuals in whom HCV presence was only identified after treatment of the cells with C5L (Table 1 and Fig. 3). Our finding of monocytes being a reservoir of replicating HCV is in agreement with those suggested by others [3, 21]. Interestingly, susceptibility of monocytes to infection is not unique to HCV. The cells of this lineage have been shown to be permissive to a wide range of viruses [34], including dengue virus [35], feline coronaviruses [36] and human immunodeficiency virus [37].",

In all three cases, there was no apparent correlation between HCV level in lymphoid cells and in serum, which was in the range of 40\u2013200 vge/mL. This indicates that relatively high HCV loads in lymphoid cells can occur in individuals with permanently low serum HCV RNA, albeit most likely transiently as PBMC samples collected a year before from the same persons contained low HCV loads, comparable with those detected in other individuals with persistent occult infection investigated in this study. A similar observation was made in occult hepadnaviral infection in the woodchuck model of hepatitis B where the number of circulating lymphoid cells carrying WHV genome was measured by in situ PCR followed by flow cytometric detection of positive cells [38]. The results of this study demonstrated that the number of virus\u2010reactive lymphoid cells in either primary or secondary occult WHV infection can be occasionally as high as that in symptomatic, serologically evident chronic hepatitis.",

The fact that the levels of the housekeeping GAPDH gene remained similar in untreated and mitogen\u2010treated samples ruled out the possibility that the mitogen\u2010cytokine cocktails might have caused cell death or random changes to viral RNA expression. We subsequently assessed the transcriptional activity of selected antiviral cytokines in both naive and stimulated lymphoid cells to assess whether these cytokines may be of relevance to HCV replication. It is of note that IFN\u03b15 was selected for this investigation as it has been reported that this isoform of IFN\u03b1, one of the 13 members of the IFN\u03b1 family, was found to be predominantly induced in circulating lymphoid cells [39] but downregulated in hepatic tissue [40] of patients with CHC. The results of our analysis showed that a down\u2010regulation of HCV RNA was closely correlated with an increase in the level of IFN\u03b15 expression. Conversely, augmentation of HCV replication paralleled a decrease in the intracellular IFN\u03b15 mRNA level (Fig. 5). Demonstration of a similar relation between HCV RNA load and of IFN\u2010stimulated MxA confirmed that activation of the IFN\u03b1 signalling pathway most likely plays a pivotal role in the control of HCV replication in lymphoid cells in the course of occult infection. In contrast, neither IFN\u03b3 nor TNF\u03b1 expression appeared to have any direct association with the rate of HCV replication. Such an antiviral effect of endogenous IFN\u03b1 against viral pathogens replicating in lymphoid cells is not exclusive to HCV, as similar observations have been made in both in vivo and in vitro settings for human herpesvirus\u20108 [41], dengue virus [42] and West Nile virus [43]. Our findings and those reported for patients with CHC [39] collectively suggest that HCV infection does not seem to impede the production of IFN\u03b1 in lymphoid cells, unlike that with hepatitis B virus [44] or HIV [45]. What however remains unknown, and will require a separate study, is the interplay between HCV and the host machinery mediating activation of lymphoid cells in response to mitogen treatment. Deciphering the underlying molecular mechanisms would be of importance as the amount of HCV residing in lymphoid cells appears to predetermine the outcome of mitogen stimulation in regard to IFN\u03b1 expression and whether subsequently HCV replication is augmented, suppressed or even aborted in these cells. Understanding of this issue may have a direct impact not only on the designing practical approaches for detection of occult HCV infection, but also on individualized methods of induction on HCV clearance in particular virological situations.",
