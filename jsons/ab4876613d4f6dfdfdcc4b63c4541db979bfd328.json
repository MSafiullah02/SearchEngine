Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are usually defined as diseases that have infected new hosts or have spread into new geographic area or have changed their pathogenic features or are caused by pathogenic agents not previously recognized. The outbreaks of these diseases frequently occur starting from viruses mutated from an animal host and obtained the ability of infecting humans [4] . Viruses may invade the brain or spinal cord, causing acute or chronic neurologic durations. Emerging infections affecting the CNS often present as encephalitis with substantial morbidity and mortality [5, 6] . Despite notable improvements in disease prevention and treatment, infectious diseases of the CNS remain an important source of morbidity and mortality, particularly in less-developed countries and in immunocompromised individuals [5, 6] . These emerging and challenging CNS infections are still increasing. The upcoming decades are sure to provide us with an ever-evolving landscape of infection. We are encountering more opportunities and facing more challenges in the future.",

The evidence of Zika virus infection of aborted fetuses associated with microcephaly has been confirmed. The imaging features of microcephaly secondary to Zika virus infection include calcifications, cortical abnormalities, diminution of white matter, large ventricles with or without hydrocephalus, cortical malformations, hypoplasia of the cerebellum and brain stem, and enlargement of the cerebellar cistern ( Fig. 6.1 ). CT and US could show a consistent pattern of widespread brain calcifications ( Fig. 6. 2) [3] . Radiology plays a key role on the monitoring of patients with ZIKV infection [10, 11] .",

Preoperative imaging examination plays a critical role on planning the procedure and prognosis assessment in patients with CNS infection [8] . Early neurosurgical intervention is advocated to prevent the ongoing risk of fatal complications [12] . CT is probably useful in the specific patients with calcification and hemorrhage, typically in the acute stage or in the early stages of Paragonimus migration [13] . Routine MRI generally could show its great advantages over CT. Advanced MRI, such as MR spectroscopy (MRS) have provided a surrogate marker of tissue chemical components, thereby could differentiate parasitic infections from other infections and also possibly monitor therapeutic response.

During the past 30 years, though the prevention of infections is by vaccine and antimicrobial agents, infections remain to be the major killer of permanent neurologic disability globally [14] . Diagnosis requires not only careful inquiring history but also applying newly developed diagnostic tests. It is still a major challenge to confirm the etiology of inflammatory disorders in the clinical setting, as over 50% cases would be undiagnosed [15] . Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is able to discover the transcriptome of host tissue and capture microbial genomes (i.e., bacteria, fungi, and viruses) that reside in the tissue niche. Deep sequencing of total DNA or RNA provides an unbiased approach that can detect even rare components of the microbiome [16] . Unbiased metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) represents a wholly different approach using random hexamer primers to amplify all the nucleic acids in a biological sample like cerebrospinal fluid or brain biopsy samples. Using bioinformatic pipelines, it also can analyze enormous sequencing data sets to identify the microbial source in samples promptly [17] . Moreover, diagnostic decision-making of viral CNS infections demands a global knowledge of epidemiology, including the foci and spread of arboviruses worldwide [18] . The global health and biodefense communities are focused on the threat of emerging pathogens, many of which have severe neurologic sequelae. With the globalization and time change, we would have to confront a changing landscape of neurological infections.",
