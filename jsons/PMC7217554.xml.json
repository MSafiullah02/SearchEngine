A large number of networks representing real systems show a heavy-tailed degree distribution described by a power law P(k)\u223ck\u2212\u03b3\n[4,5], usually with strong levels of correlations [6,7]. Degree correlations are encoded in the conditional probability P(k\u2032|k) that a vertex of degree k is connected to a vertex of degree k\u2032\n[6]. Technological networks, such as the Internet, show in general disassortative mixing [6,7], i.e., vertices of large degree tend to be connected with those of small degree and vice versa. Assortative mixing occurs in social networks, where connections preferentially occur among vertices exhibiting similar degree. Since uncorrelated networks usually simplify theoretical approaches, they are typical benchmarks for the investigation of dynamical processes on networks and have been considered in many studies [8\u201310]. However, the ubiquitousness of correlations in real networks naturally calls for the investigation of the effect of correlated interaction patterns. While the effects of degree correlations have been considered for several dynamical processes [11\u201316], a full understanding of their effects on the performance of theoretical approaches is still missing.",

A more refined approach is provided by the quenched mean-field (QMF) theory [19\u201321], which considers the full topology as described by the unweighted adjacency matrix (defined as Aij=1 if vertices i and j are connected and Aij=0 otherwise) and thus takes into account the detailed connectivity structure.",

For random uncorrelated networks, such as those created according to the uncorrelated configuration model [29], when \u03b3<5/2 the two theories tend to agree, predicting a vanishing threshold as the network size diverges [22]. For \u03b3>3 instead, QMF theory correctly predicts again the asymptotic vanishing of the epidemic threshold [30], while the HMF theory fails, predicting the existence of a finite threshold. In spite of being qualitatively correct, QMF theory is however not able to accurately predict the effective finite-size epidemic threshold in this case [25]. A further quantitative improvement of the QMF theory has been achieved in Ref. [26] [hereafter called of pair QMF (PQMF) theory] by means of the explicit inclusion of pairwise dynamical correlations [31\u201333].

            "text": "In this work we investigate the ability of the aforementioned approaches (HMF, QMF, and PQMF) to quantitatively predict the value of the epidemic threshold for both uncorrelated and correlated networks generated using the Weber-Porto model [35] and for real-world topologies. We find that correlations do not change qualitatively the scenario found on uncorrelated networks. The epidemic threshold vanishes asymptotically with the system size for both assortative and disassortative correlations. For \u03b3<5/2, both QMF and PQMF theories seem to provide an asymptotically exact estimate of the numerical threshold, while they are only qualitatively correct for \u03b3>5/2. As in the case of uncorrelated networks [26], PQMF theory outperforms the other theories. The amplitude of the discrepancies between numerics and theory is correlated with violations of the assumptions underlying them, revealing that both theories tend to be more accurate if the principal eigenvector of the (effective) adjacency matrix is not strongly localized or the spectral gap is large. The same scenario is found to hold when SIS dynamics is considered on a set of real-world topologies. In addition, we analyze the singularity of the prevalence near the transition point through the critical exponent \u03b2, defined as \u03c1\u223c(\u03bb\u2212\u03bbc)\u03b2. Interestingly, we find that for \u03b3<5/2, even if the QMF theory provides an asymptotically exact estimate of the position of the epidemic threshold, the QMF prediction for the prevalence exponent, \u03b2(QMF)=1\n[23,36], is correct only not too close to the transition.",

We adopt different upper cutoffs for the degree distribution. For \u03b3<3, the structural cutoff kmax=2N\n[37] is used, while for \u03b3>3, a rigid cutoff is determined by the condition NP(kmax)=1\n[38]. The first choice allows us to enhance the effects of hubs and to approach faster the thermodynamic limit while fulfilling the criterion kmax<\u2329k\u232aN necessary to produce uncorrelated networks in the case \u03b1=0\n[37]. The second choice is justified by numerical reasons explained in Sec. II B. The predetermined scaling law \u03bann(k)\u223ck\u03b1 is very well reproduced. Small deviations for positive or negative \u03b1 are due to the network finite size that prevents \u03bann from decaying or increasing indefinitely with k. The range of the power-law behavior is extended as the network size increases.\n",

We concentrate for the moment on two values of \u03b3, representative of the cases \u03b3<5/2 and \u03b3>3, for which the physical mechanisms underlying the epidemic transition are clear [47]. Later we will discuss the case 5/2<\u03b3<3, whose interpretation is hampered by extremely long crossover phenomena in the spectral properties. As we can see from this figure, all thresholds vanish as N diverges, regardless of the correlation level \u03b1 and heterogeneity \u03b3. Compared to the uncorrelated case, assortative networks (\u03b1>0) have a smaller threshold, while the threshold is larger for \u03b1<0, i.e., disassortative mixing, in agreement with the behavior of the LEV of the adjacency matrix [14,23]. In the case \u03b3>3, this phenomenology can be qualitatively explained by considering the mechanism of long-range mutual reinfection of hubs [25,46,48], which triggers the epidemic transition. According to this mechanism, the subgraph consisting of the hub plus its nearest neighbors can sustain in isolation an active state for times long enough to permit the activation of other hubs, even if they are not directly connected. This mechanism is at work independently of degree correlations, as long as distances among hubs increase slowly enough with network size. In assortative networks, communication among hubs is enhanced since they have higher probability to be closer; for disassortative topology the converse is true and larger values of \u03bb are needed to trigger the transition.\n",

For \u03b3=3.5, the predictions of PQMF and QMF theories succeed, qualitatively, in predicting that the threshold approaches zero in the thermodynamic limit even in the presence of correlations. However, the theoretical threshold estimates depart from simulation results leading to decreasing ratios \u03bbcMF/\u03bbc in the large network limit. We expect this ratio to decrease asymptotically as 1/ln(kmax)\n[46], in agreement with recent rigorous results [49]. Again, PQMF theory performs better than QMF theory.

Actually, however, the QMF approach neglects dynamical correlations, which have the effect of allowing mutual reinfection events among different hubs in the network. In this way an endemic global state can be established due to the long-range interactions among localized states [46] setting the actual threshold to an intermediate value: \u03bbcQMF<\u03bbc<\u03bbcHMF. With this picture in mind, we can predict that, if the localization is stronger (higher values of the IPR Y4), the actual threshold will be farther from \u03bbcQMF and thus the performance (accuracy) of the QMF approach will be reduced.",

The analyses for QMF theory are shown in the scatter plots of the relative error \u025b against the corresponding topological properties in Figs. 7(d) and 7(e). Qualitatively similar patterns obtained for PQMF theory are not shown. We can see that in real networks, the correlation between the performance of the theoretical prediction and the spectral gap is on average the same as that observed for the WPCM: A larger spectral gap is associated with a higher accuracy. The inverse correlation with the IPR is again preserved: A smaller Y4 corresponds to a more accurate prediction. We do not find a significant correlation with the Pearson coefficient. Statistical analyses were performed using the correlation coefficients obtained from either power law, in the case of the spectral gap and IPR, or from exponential, in the case of the Pearson coefficient, regressions of the scatter plots. We obtain strong statistical correlations with |r|\u22730.70 (p<10\u22125) for both QMF and PQMF theories using either the IPR or spectral gap of the corresponding matrices. Values r\u22720.2 (p>0.05) for correlation with the Pearson coefficient of the network confirm no significant statistical correlations.",

This observation naturally leads to one wonder whether the QMF theory is asymptotically an exact description for SIS dynamics on random networks with \u03b3<5/2. In order to answer this question we test the exactness of the other prediction of the QMF theory, Eq. (12), stating that the fraction of infected individuals decays to zero linearly as the threshold is approached from above. Numerical results, for the case of uncorrelated networks \u03b1=0 are shown in Fig. 8, where the density and the infection rates are rescaled to conform to Eq. (12). We can clearly see the existence of two scaling regimes. For \u03bb\u039b1\u22121\u226a1 the density scales with an exponent larger than the prediction \u03b2(QMF)=1. The observed exponent is consistent with the exact result of Ref. [51], \u03b2=1/(3\u2212\u03b3), which is also (probably accidentally) the value predicted by HMF theory [52]. This exponent is observed in a regime very close to the transition, where the system is kept asymptotically active only by virtue of the quasistationary method. We performed a nonperturbative analysis by integrating the QMF equations using a fourth-order Runge-Kutta method for \u03bb>1\u039b(1) for N=107. A comparison with simulation results confirms that the QMF theory correctly predicts the linear behavior of the prevalence \u03c1 around the epidemic transition, but only sufficiently far from it. In the immediate neighborhood of the threshold the decay is more rapid.\n",

Several theoretical approaches have been proposed, applying approximations with different levels of stringency, that provide contrasting predictions on the epidemic threshold. Among the main theoretical approaches at the mean-field level we can consider, in decreasing order of approximation, the heterogeneous mean-field theory, neglecting dynamical correlations and the actual pattern of connections in the network (preserving only its statistical properties); the quenched mean-field theory, also neglecting dynamical correlations but keeping the network structure; and the pair quenched mean-field theory, which incorporates dynamical correlations between pairs of connected nodes. In this paper we have presented a comparison of the predictions of these three approximate theories for the case of the susceptible-infected-susceptible epidemic model, focusing on the case of networks with a power-law degree distribution and degree correlations, representative of many real network systems.",

While overall PQMF theory is more accurate than QMF theory, the two approximations show different levels of accuracy when compared in networks with different levels of correlations. Thus, for the case of synthetic networks generated with the Weber-Porto algorithm [35], we observed that, for fixed network size and degree heterogeneity, QMF predictions are more accurate in assortative networks than in disassortative ones. On the other hand, PQMF theory is increasingly accurate in the presence of disassortative correlations for small degree exponent, while it is more accurate when correlations are assortative if the degree exponent is large.",
