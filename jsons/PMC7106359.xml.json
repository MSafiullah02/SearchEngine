The emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) prompted additional travel guidance and enhanced surveillance following Hajj, including in Jordan, which has reported cases of MERS-CoV and shares its eastern and southern borders with KSA [1], [4]. Based upon the number of Hajj visas issued, approximately 5600 pilgrims from Jordan traveled to KSA for the 2014 Hajj. In October 2014, Jordan established targeted surveillance of acute respiratory illnesses in Hajj pilgrims returning to Jordan.",

Persons were considered for enrollment in surveillance if they (1) traveled to the 2014 Hajj, and (2) presented with respiratory illness. Institutional Review Board approval was obtained in Jordan for this public health response, and verbal consent was obtained prior to enrollment.

MERS-CoV was not detected in any subject, and none of the bacterial pathogens tested (Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila) were detected. Viral co-detections were observed in 13 (10%) of participants, all of which were rhino/enterovirus-positive. Except for one specimen in which parainfluenza type 1 was identified, panviral family/genus PCR did not add additional clinically relevant results beyond what was already detected by multi-pathogen array cards. There were no significant differences in detection of any single pathogen between NP/OP and OP-only specimens (data not shown).",

However, given that symptomatic pilgrims presented in the two-week surveillance window immediately following Hajj suggests that the large majority of infections would have been acquired during the Hajj pilgrimage. Our surveillance employed geographically diverse sentinel sites and comprehensive targeted health messaging, but it is possible that symptomatic cases were incompletely captured, particularly in pilgrims with milder illness who may have been less likely to present to medical care after their return. Finally, although a minority of subjects refused NP swabs, lower rates of pathogen detection were not observed in these subjects. Despite these limitations, our findings are consistent with previous surveillance studies which suggest they are representative of the epidemiology of post-Hajj respiratory infections.",
