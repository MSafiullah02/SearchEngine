TTF provides a means to quantify the effectiveness of technology in an organizations [6]. In 2012, Furneaux [7] identified the \u201cnotable increase in the use of TTF theory\u201d. This trend has continued over the years, with both an increase in the yearly number of documents published as well as in the range of environments which the theory is used, as discussed in this paper.",

Furneaux [7] considered a much larger sample of studies where TTF was used, all of which were conducted before 2010, to synthesize the conceptualization, methodologies and research contexts.
