Moreover, one can consider, instead of the dichotomy alive/dead, dichotomies such as healthy/infected, student/worker, or not parent/parent. Here, we consider the daily time scale and the dichotomy alive/dead because of the application.",

For example, consider the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the DSP within the population of SARS in-patients was expected to be positively influenced by improvements, with time, of the knowledge about the disease and the management of the authorities [28], [29]. Other examples arise in prey-predator systems. Indeed, the survival probability of preys may be affected for instance by (i) the time-varying count of predators, (ii) the time-varying count of preys, (iii) the time-varying size of preys. In the case of infectious diseases, the probability for an individual to stay healthy may be affected by the count of infectious individuals at the date before (autoregressive process). In social science, the probability for an individual to stay a student may be affected by the time-varying policy of the government.",

But collecting daily data and repeating the measures a large number of days may not be possible. Indeed, each measure may be time and money consuming, and may affect the survival of individuals. That is the reason why, instead of daily measures, one can choose to carry out for several groups of individuals a few measures separated by several days, e.g. one initial measure plus a few additional measures. To get data corresponding to a large range of the time-varying covariate, the groups have to be sampled for different ranges of the covariate. Such a structure for the data generates two problems: (i) the observations are time-period (or interval) censored and (ii) there may be group effects. These two points should be taken into account when a statistical analysis of the data is performed.",

Accurate quantitative knowledge about the link between the DSP and the length of mosquitofish is needed (i) for improving the knowledge about life history traits of mosquitofish and, more specifically, (ii) for building an individual-based model describing the dynamics of mosquitofish populations in experimental ecosystems (mesocosms). This model, still under construction in research units of the National Institute for Agricultural Research (INRA, France), is being developed to carry out studies in ecotoxicology (mosquitofish is an experimental animal commonly used in ecotoxicology; see for instance [5], [9], [10], [15], [24]). A first version of the individual-based model, presented in [12], describes at a daily time step the early stages of the establishment of a mosquitofish population. In that earlier version, the link between fish length and fish survival was modeled such that below a fixed threshold a fish had constant DSP \u03c0\n1 and above the threshold a fish had constant DSP \u03c0\n2\n > \n\u03c0\n1.",

The mesocosms consisted of circular metal tanks (3.0 m diameter, 0.6  m height) filled with various elements for building fish habitats. In January, the tanks were lined up with polyethylene film (0.2 mm thick), filled with tap water (water depth: 45 cm), and sediments were introduced at a uniform layer (about 5 cm thick). The tanks then sat for a few months to allow for phyto- and zoo-plankton as well as macroinvertebrates to naturally settle in the tanks. In April, pieces of Ludwigia peploide were introduced into the mesocosms. Then, at different times in the summer, groups of mosquitofish were introduced in the mesocosms, one group per mesocosm, and nets with small mesh were installed to protect the fish from bird predation.",

For 6 groups (i\n \u2a7e 33 in Table 1), fish were captured, counted, measured for length and released in the mesocosms two or three times. Such an experimental procedure is particularly time-consuming because, as mosquitofish survival can be affected by the stress of captures, fish must be captured and manipulated with care. That is the reason why, for 32 other groups (i\n \u2a7d 32 in Table 1), fish were captured, counted, measured for length only one time after their introduction in the mesocosms. Forty six captures were done in total for the 38 groups of fish.

In the context of mosquitofish this assumption is not strong, but in other contexts it can be. For instance, instead of the occurrence of the death of a mosquitofish, consider the occurrence of a transmissible disease affecting humans (e.g. AIDS, SARS), animals (e.g. avian flu) or plants (e.g. wheat rusts), and suppose one aims to link the DSP (the time step of interest can be different from the day) with the time-varying intensity of prevention measures for example. In such a context, assumption A\n2 is clearly not suitable. Indeed, the \u201csurvival\u201d process of an individual can affect the \u201csurvival\u201d processes of other individuals since the disease is transmissible. The model might be adapted by conditioning the transition probabilities (1) not only on the past state of the individual of interest but also on the past states for the other individuals. The consequences on the construction of the model and on the estimation procedure of such a modification should be explored.",
