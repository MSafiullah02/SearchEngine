At the time we write this, there have been more than 700,000 confirmed cases and more than 37,000 deaths, with both of those figures predicted to increase exponentially in the coming weeks. In these unprecedented and uncertain times, headache medicine clinicians are working to keep individuals with migraine out of the Emergency Department (ED) and hospital, while also foregoing or at least minimizing face-to-face visits and procedural treatments. This is of critical importance not only in protecting the safety of our patients and limiting their exposure to COVID-19, but also as part of the greater efforts to avoid infection of healthcare workers, and to minimize additional demands on an already oversaturated hospital infrastructure.",

            "text": "Second, we call upon health insurance providers, both government-funded and commercial, to remove barriers to quality migraine care. Migraine is highly prevalent, and is the second leading cause of years lost to disability worldwide. 1 In the United States chronic migraine disproportionately affects those of low socioeconomic status, 2 who are also bearing the financial brunt of the COVID-related economic crisis. With this in mind, we applaud the efforts of the federal and state governments and many commercial insurance providers who have quickly altered rules and regulations to facilitate the use of telehealth. In addition, we call upon insurance providers to eliminate prior authorization and step therapy requirements for migraine therapies, so that patients may have access to appropriate treatments in a time-sensitive manner and without undue administrative encumbrances. Further, given that nearly 1/5 of households in the United States reported a layoff or reduction in work hours related to coronavirus by March 14, 2020, 3 it is imperative that insurance providers minimize or eliminate copays for migraine medications. While it may seem unthinkable to ask insurers to pay additional money for these therapies as other health care costs increase, multiple pharmacoeconomic studies have demonstrated that coverage of expensive migraine medications is actually cost-saving, as it decreases disability and reliance on hospital care. [4] [5] [6] Telehealth Becomes Mainstream.-Telemedicine, which is real time interactive audio and video remote communication between a patient and a provider, has been practiced for over a decade in the United States. Single clinic studies of telemedicine visits for headache care have demonstrated that patients perceive telemedicine as cost-effective and convenient. 7 Compared to traditional in-person headache visits, telemedicine achieves similar satisfaction rates 8 and outcomes, 9 and recent investigations demonstrated non-inferiority in multiple neurological diseases. 10 However, many factors have precluded its widespread use, including large scale verification of clinical efficacy and safety in comparison to live visits, 11 technological capabilities, patient confidentiality/privacy, licensing restrictions and malpractice, reimbursement, and frank inertia. Federal and state governments have not championed this modality, despite ongoing need to care for patients otherwise unable to reach providers' offices. 12 In the era of COVID-19, telehealth has become an essential modality for most headache specialists, given the need for providers to take significant precautions for both their patients and themselves, limiting touch or close contact. 13 Clinicians have had to rapidly learn local and federal laws, regulations, coding, and reimbursement options that may also change by the day. Qualified providers may now bill fee for service Medicare patients using traditional evaluation and management codes for telemedicine visits, regardless if they are in a Health Professional Shortage Area. However, Medicaid and Medicare Advantage patients are excluded from recent emergency declarations. Parity laws also vary per state, which impacts commercial insurance reimbursements. 14 Furthermore, while federal restraints have been waived to allow qualified providers to practice in any state, state laws may nonetheless continue to prohibit aspects of interstate practice, such as restrictions on new patient consultations or prescribing controlled substances. In some circumstances when telemedicine visits are not permitted or feasible, telephone visits can be performed and billed. As these rules are changing rapidly, the American Academy of Neurology has launched a website which assists with practical details for conducting telehealth visits, coding, and state-by-state coverage (https://www.aan.com/teleh ealth).",

Patients no longer have to miss work, drive long distances, spend money on gas, tolls, and parking lots, and wait prolonged periods in a doctor's office to be seen, where they might also be exposed to communicable diseases. We hope that the widespread use of telehealth will be supported even after the COVID-19 pandemic has resolved.

NSAIDs inhibit the neuroinflammatory cascade and prostaglandin synthesis, which are implicated in the pathogenesis of a migraine attack. COX1/COX2 inhibition may also inhibit prostaglandin release in nociceptive neurons in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC) which is involved in central sensitization in migraine. 27 Contraindications to NSAID use include a history of GI bleeding, other bleeding risks, and renal impairment. In addition, diclofenac should be avoided in patients with heart failure or previous myocardial infarction. 28 The World Health Organization initially expressed that NSAIDs may exacerbate COVID-19 symptoms, but then retracted their recommendation to avoid NSAIDs due to lack of evidence for this claim. 29 The FDA issued an advisory on March 19, 2020, that it \"is not aware of scientific evidence connecting the use of NSAIDs, like ibuprofen, with worsening COVID-19 symptoms. The agency is investigating this issue further \u2026.\" 30 Recommendations may change further as our understanding of COVID-19 evolves. Clinicians should consider these differing viewpoints, the most current guidelines and recommendations, and the needs of their individual patient when deciding to use NSAIDs. Neuroleptics.-Dopamine and serotonin (5-HT 3 ) are thought to be implicated in the pathogenesis of migraine. Neuroleptics act as dopamine antagonists and also have substantial anti-cholinergic, anti-serotonergic, anti-histaminergic, and anti-adrenergic effects. 31, 32 Some neuroleptics also have a role as anti-emetics. Side effects may include dizziness, somnolence (especially if taken during daytime, so avoid driving after use), and extra-pyramidal symptoms (especially with prolonged and frequent use). Some of these can prolong the QT interval on EKG, so use caution if the patient has known prolonged QT syndrome or if the patient is taking multiple QT prolonging medications.",

Headaches treated with opioids have a high recurrence rate after the initial analgesic effect, and opioids may exert a pro-nociceptive state that may prevent the reversal of central sensitization following a migraine attack. Additionally, both of these classes of medication carry a high risk of habituation and dependency, and over time may contribute to medication overuse headache. 43 Preventive Therapies.-While the injection of on-abotulinumtoxinA is an effective treatment for chronic migraine, 44 the procedure can put the patient and the provider at higher risk of COVID-19 given the close contact encounter. We believe that other migraine preventive treatments should be utilized first when possible. Some patients on onabotulinumtoxinA may have been started on it and stable before newer preventive medication results have been published/approved. Thus, we urge providers to first consult the American Academy of Neurology/American Headache Society Guidelines (last published in 2012 45 ; new ones are currently being produced) and to re-evaluate patients' responses to the medications listed in those guidelines. In addition, therapies which have been demonstrated to be beneficial since the development of that guideline include:",

Migraine can worsen during times of stress, so having available options that bypass insurance hurdles and can be administered at home without patient training is imperative. Telehealth provides an important opportunity to continue to care for our vulnerable population and help avoid emergency room and urgent care visits that put patients at risk and burden the overwhelmed healthcare system. The largest at-risk group of established migraine patients are those that depend on procedures to allow them to remain functional and out of the emergency room. The shortage of personal protective equipment has caused an unfortunate break in care for many of these patients. During the current pandemic we, headache specialists, make a plea to insurers to lift cumbersome restrictions to allow patients greater availability of evidence-based treatment options to reduce the burden of their disease. One example would be to allow patients who were being treated with onabotulinumtoxinA to bridge with an anti-CGRP/ CGRP-receptor mAb while their procedures may be postponed. Our common goal as health care providers is to maintain the health of our patients while continuing to keep ourselves, our staff, and our families safe. Successful management of migraine with avoidance of in-person patient clinic visits further benefits the current urgent overall societal goal of maintaining social distance to contain the pandemic.",
