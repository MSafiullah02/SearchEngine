Based on the run episodes in these markets during the \u2026nancial crisis of 2007-09 and the calibrated model, we \u2026nd that the value of a liquidity backstop is about 14.5 basis points per annum.

They are both money-like securities and close substitutes, but di\u00a4er along one important dimension: VRDOs are typically structured with liquidity backstop facilities committed by banks serving as liquidity providers, but there are no such liquidity backstops in the ARS market. Figure 1 plots the average interest rates in these markets since May 2006. Before the \u2026nancial crisis, market participants had mistakenly believed that ARS have the same liquidity backstops as VRDOs, 3 as re \u2021ected by the almost identical average interest rates in both markets before 2007. The outbreak of the \u2026nancial crisis shattered the misperception: the average interest rates in these markets started to diverge since November 2017.",

The run on ARS is evident in Figure 1 in the spike of its interest rate at around 6.6% in early 2008. By contrast, the existence of the liquidity backstops helped to stabilize the VRDO market and the VRDO rate was stabilized around 2% during that period. Later that year, in September 2008, the Lehman bankruptcy cast into doubt whether the liquidity providers would be able to honor their liquidity commitment. Consequently runs on both VRDO and ARS occurred following the Lehman bankruptcy and the average VRDO and ARS rates jumped in unison to around 8% on September 24, 2008.

Second, the model's equilibrium is characterized by a unique \"rollover threshold\" such that creditors'decision to run or not depends on whether the fundamental falls below the threshold. The distance between the fundamental value and the rollover threshold determines the run probability. We calibrate the model to the historical interest rate data for both markets. Using calibrated key model parameters, we are able to infer the unobserved fundamental process as well as the model-implied rollover thresholds in both markets. Consistent with our iden-ti\u2026cation assumption that ARS investors have started to recognize the lack of a liquidity backstop since the onset of the \u2026nancial crisis, the calibrated ARS rollover threshold has since then jumped to a higher level than the VRDO threshold.

The value of a liquidity backstop, the key focus of this paper, speaks to the central di\u00a4erence between the shadow banking system and the traditional banking system and gives a direct measure of how shadowy the shadow banking is. 4 Fees on liquidity facilities for VRDO are, however, not publicly disclosed because municipal securities are exempt from federal securities registration and reporting requirements. 5 The implicit government guarantee to government-sponsored entities (GSEs) is another example.

The He-Xiong model highlights the dynamic coordination problem between creditors whose contracts mature at di\u00a4erent times -fear of future rollover risk could motivate each current maturing creditor to run ahead of others because a run can trigger a premature liquidation and lead to credit losses. In a closely related paper, Schroth, Suarez, and Taylor (2014) extend and apply the He-Xiong model to the ABCP market. The authors show that an endogenous \"dilution risk\", arising from higher yields demanded by maturing creditors, increases the likelihood of runs. By contrast, in our model a run imposes an additional type of negative externalities, because an ARS run in our model may trigger uncommitted liquidity support to fail and its failure makes creditors unable to liquidate their bond holdings. This new channel explains why the ARS market that lacks liquidity backstops was more susceptible to runs than the VRDO market. In addition, our di\u00a4erent focus on empirical identi\u2026cation of the value of a liquidity backstop distinguishes our paper from theirs. This paper also contributes to the literature on empirical identi\u2026cation of strategic complementarities in \u2026nancial markets. As pointed out in Goldstein (2013), it is challenging to empirically identify strategic complementarities due to interactions between fundamentals and strategic behavior. Several recent papers (e.g., Chen, Goldstein, and Jiang (2010 ), Hertzberg, Liberti, and Paravisini (2011 ), Foley-Fisher, Narajabad, and Verani (2015 , Schmidt, Timmermann, and Wermers (2016)) utilize di\u00a4erent sources of variation in strategic complementaries as part of their identi\u2026cation strategies. Di\u00a4erent from these papers, we exploit the ARS crisis of early 2008 as a unique natural experiment for identi\u2026cation and can 6 For empirical studies, please see Carey, Correa, and Kotter (2009) and Covitz, Liang, and Suarez (2012) for the run on ABCP, Gorton and Metrick (2012) This paper is also related to the literature on the role of banks as liquidity providers. Kashyap, Rajan, and Stein (2002) provide a convincing argument that banks have a natural advantage of acting as liquidity providers to provide liquidity on demand. The advantage stems from a synergy between deposit-taking and loan commitments to the extent that both types of activities require banks to hold large balances of liquid assets and are not too highly correlated. 7 However, as Acharya and Mora (2015) argue, the recent \u2026nancial crisis suggest that both sides of a bank's balance sheet might be hit simultaneously. In this paper, we further investigate the destabilizing e\u00a4ects when banks as liquidity providers cut back on uncommitted lending (e.g., the wave of auction failures in the ARS market).",

During the \u2026nancial crisis, major auction agents indeed chose to no longer be \"buyers of last resort.\" By contrast, the VRDO market was not a\u00a4ected as much in early 2008 due to the explicit structure of its liquidity facility.

Since then the massive auction failures during February and March resulted in a sharp increase in the probability p that reached 100% in early April 2008.

As discussed in the paper, ARS were considered almost identical to VRDOs prior to the \u2026nancial crisis, however, investors started to recognize the lack of a liquidity backstop in the ARS market at the onset of the crisis. The structural change in investors'beliefs drove a wedge in the experiences of these two markets during the crisis: the liquidity-backstop-lacking ARS market was more susceptible to runs and collapsed, while the liquidity-backstop-possessing VRDO market survived. Such structural change is also the key in identifying the value of a liquidity backstop. Based on the calibrated model, we \u2026nd that a liquidity backstop is valued at about 14.5 bps per annum.",

Consistent with the literature on the \"neglected risk\" view of shadow banking, \"shadow money\" can stop being liquid or safe once investors take account of tail risks that are previously neglected (see Gennaioli, Shleifer, and Vishny (2013) ). The key model implication in this paper is general and can be applied to shadow banking in the sense that the possibility of shadow money becoming illiquid in the future prompts investors to run more often, ex ante. Having a public liquidity backstop (e.g., deposit insurance) e\u00a4ectively mitigates (or even eliminates) runs induced by such liquidity risk.

On the other hand, the subprime mortgage meltdown also signi\u2026cantly strained balance sheets of auction agents (e.g., Citibank, Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, UBS, Royal Bank of Canada and JP Morgan) to the extent that they decided not to intervene and let the auctions fail in mid-February 2008. Reportedly, about 60% to 80% of auctions failed in the second half of February in 2008. 10 The wave of auction failures drove up the ARS rate to as high as 6.6% around mid-February 2008 as shown in Figure 1.
