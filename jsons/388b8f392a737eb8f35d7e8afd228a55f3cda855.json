For example, the rapidity of bacterial protein expression often results in unfolded/misfolded proteins, especially for heterologous proteins that require longer times and/or molecular chaperones to fold correctly. In addition, the highly reductive environment of the bacterial cytosol and the inability of E. coli to perform several eukaryotic post-translational modifications results in the insoluble expression of proteins that require these modifications for folding and activity. Fortunately, multiple, novel reagents and techniques have been developed that allow for the efficient, soluble production of a diverse range of heterologous proteins in E. coli.

Most significantly, it has dramatically expanded the number of proteins that can be investigated both biochemically and structurally. Previously, protein production was the domain of experts, as purification from a natural source (i.e., plants, rabbits, bovine) was often difficult and time consuming. However, the availability of new commercial systems for recombinant protein expression, combined with advanced protein purification techniques, has made protein production prevalent throughout the biological and biomedical sciences. This has enabled the research community to study thousands of low abundance and novel proteins from a large variety of organisms. Notably, 31 recombinant proteins were approved for therapeutic use between 2003 and 2006, highlighting the importance of heterologous protein expression in biopharmaceutical research (Walsh, 2006) .

The rationale is clear: E. coli is easy to genetically manipulate, it is inexpensive to culture, and expression is fast, with proteins routinely produced in one day. Moreover, protocols for isotope-labeling for NMR spectroscopy and selenomethionine incorporation for X-ray crystallography are well established, making it highly suitable for structural studies.

Thus, some targets, especially larger multidomain and membrane proteins, either fail to express in E. coli or express insolubly as inclusion bodies. Moreover, insolubility is not just restricted to heterologous proteins, as many bacterial proteins also cannot be produced in soluble form when overexpressed in E. coli (Vincentelli et al., 2003) . In addition, the reducing environment of the bacterial cytoplasm makes the efficient production of disulfide-containing proteins challenging (Stewart et al., 1998; Ritz and Beckwith, 2001) . Finally, E. coli lacks the machinery required to perform certain eukaryotic post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which can be critical for the formation of folded, active protein . Considerable efforts have been made in recent years to maximize the efficient production of soluble recombinant proteins in bacteria. A remarkable number of novel reagents (new vectors, new host strains) and strategies (chaperone co-expression, low temperature induction) have been developed that allow many of these disadvantages to be readily and successfully overcome. It is this topic, how to optimize soluble protein expression in E. coli, that is the focus of this review. Section I outlines a typical expression protocol for the production of heterologous proteins in E. coli. While this protocol has proven highly successful for a broad range of targets, every protein has its own unique set of biophysical characteristics that often requires protocol changes in order to successfully express the target. Thus, in the second part of this review, critical parameters that are essential to consider when designing a protein expression strategy are highlighted (Fig. 5.24 .1). These parameters have the common goal of maximizing the yield of soluble, active protein.

For these cases, expression that causes the protein to be incorporated into inclusion bodies is suggested, as the recombinant protein, while misfolded or unfolded, is highly enriched and protected from proteases (Valax and Georgiou, 1993) .

With each selection affecting the solubility and activity of the protein product, this task can appear daunting. However, decades of work by individual protein chemists, coupled with the recent experiences of high-throughput structural genomics efforts, have resulted in the identification of a consensus protocol that allows a diverse set of proteins to be successfully expressed in E. coli.

REPRESENTATIVE PROTOCOL FOR EXPRESSING PROTEINS IN BACTERIA"}, {"text": "The protocol outlined in Figure 5 .24.2 consists of nine steps. First, the optimal residue boundaries of the desired protein product, the \"target protein,\" are determined. The target gene is then subcloned into a bacterial expression vector that utilizes the T7 lacO promoter system (i.e., that used in the pET system) and contains both an N-terminal hexahistadine (his 6 )-tag and a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease site (Peti and Page, 2007) . The T7 promoter system provides strong, robust expression, the his 6 -tag facilitates purification, while the protease site allows the (his 6 )-tag to be proteolytically removed from the purified target protein. In the third step, the expression vector is transformed into a derivative of the BL21 (DE3) strain, such as BL21 (DE3)-RIL cells. These cells, which are compatible with the T7 promoter system, contain plasmids that encode arginine, isoleucine, and leucine tRNAs that are rare in E. coli, and are deficient in both lon and ompT proteases, which minimizes in vivo degradation of the target protein. After the overnight starter culture is used to inoculate the large-scale culture (step 5), the cells are grown to mid-log phase (OD 600 of \u223c0.6 to 0.9) in Luria broth (LB) in baffled shaker flasks (which increases aeration and thus yield) at 37 \u2022 C with constant shaking. The cultures are then transferred to a lower temperature (18 \u2022 C), and, once cooled, protein expression is induced using isopropyl\u03b2-thio-galactoside (IPTG). Expression is continued overnight with vigorous shaking (200 to 250 rpm) at 18 \u2022 C. The lower expression temperature facilitates the production of folded, soluble protein. Finally, the cells are pelleted by centrifugation and stored at \u221280 \u2022 C until needed. This protocol is meant to serve as a starting point for designing an expression strategy in E. coli. However, because multiple char-acteristics of the protein, vector, host strain, and/or expression conditions may need to be modified in order for folded, active protein to be produced, it is not uncommon to see more complicated protocols that test these variables in parallel (Peti and Page, 2007) .

The approximate time required to complete each segment of the protocol is listed to the left of the corresponding step. (Sharp and Li, 1987) . This includes codons for arginine (AGA, AGG), isoleucine (AUA), leucine (CUA), and proline (CCC). Target genes that contain significant numbers of individual rare codons, or smaller numbers of tandem rare codons, are more likely to experience translational stalling in E. coli, and thus often either completely fail to express, express at very low levels, or are expressed as truncated proteins (Kane, 1995 , Cruz-Vera et al., 2004 . Moreover, when they do express, these rare codon-rich genes can also be incorrectly translated, as high level misincorporation of lysine for arginine at AGA codons has been observed for protein targets expressed in E. coli (Calderone et al., 1996) . Fortunately, the codon bias of E. coli is straightforward to overcome. Multiple Web sites are now available that quantify the number and the location of rare codons in a gene (e.g., the rare codon calculator, RaCC; http://nihserver.mbi.ucla.edu/RACC/). These programs also often highlight the number of consecutive rare codons. If the target protein contains a significant number of rare codons, especially tandem rare codons, two approaches can be taken. In the first, changes are made to the gene. Specifically, the gene is \"codon optimized,\" i.e., the rare codons are replaced with those that are common to the host. This can be achieved using site-directed mutagenesis. However, it is often faster and cheaper to simply have the codon-optimized gene synthesized (this service is offered by multiple companies). Gene synthesis has the added benefit that most gene optimization algorithms optimize not only rare codons, but also mRNA secondary structure, which has also been shown to affect translation efficiency (Hatfield and Roth, 2007) . In the second approach, changes are made to the expression host. Namely, genes encoding the rare tRNAs are co-expressed with the wild-type (non-optimized) target gene (Wakagi et al., 1998) . E. coli strains are now available that contain plasmids that encode rare tRNAs [i.e., BL21 (DE3)-RIL/RP/RILP cells from Stratagene or Rosetta cells from Novagen; Schenk et al., 1995; Tegel et al., 2009] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 366, "end": 386, "text": "(Sharp and Li, 1987)", "ref_id": "BIBREF131"}, {"start": 784, "end": 795, "text": "(Kane, 1995", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 796, "end": 820, "text": ", Cruz-Vera et al., 2004", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1046, "end": 1070, "text": "(Calderone et al., 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2089, "end": 2114, "text": "(Hatfield and Roth, 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 2284, "end": 2305, "text": "(Wakagi et al., 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF156"}, {"start": 2470, "end": 2490, "text": "Schenk et al., 1995;", "ref_id": "BIBREF129"}, {"start": 2491, "end": 2510, "text": "Tegel et al., 2009]", "ref_id": "BIBREF146"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Starter culture"}, {"text": "Both approaches effectively overcome codon bias.

Critically, recent large-scale, comparative studies have shown that, for most targets, either approach is equally effective (Burgess-Brown et al., 2008) .

This increase in size is due to an increase in the number of complex, multidomain proteins, in which individual domains have distinct and independent functions. Comparative studies have shown that the probability of soluble expression in E. coli decreases with increasing molecular weight, especially for proteins >60 kD (Canaves et al., 2004 , Goh et al., 2004 , Gr\u00e5slund et al., 2008a . For example, a largescale study examining the protein properties of 95 recombinantly expressed mammalian proteins found that smaller proteins (average molecular weight of 22.8 kD) were often expressed solubly alone, while larger proteins (average molecular weight of 40.4 kD) were only solubly expressed when fused to solubility-enhancing tags (Dyson et al., 2004) . In a separate study, small proteins (100 amino acids or less) were expressed solubly in E. coli at levels suitable for purification 47% of the time, while large proteins (600 to 800 amino acids) were expressed solubly only 33% of the time (Gr\u00e5slund et al., 2008a) .

When a homologous protein structure is not available, the prediction of secondary structural elements (i.e., PSIPRED; Jones, 1999) should be utilized. The disruption of predicted secondary structural elements must be avoided. Many of the bioinformatics tools needed to carry out these types of analyses are freely available at http://www.expasy.org.

They determined that contiguous hydrophobic residues (AILFWV) and low complexity regions (LCRs) negatively correlate with soluble expression. LCRs are regions of biased sequence composition, such as homopolymeric runs, short-period repeats, and overrepresentations of one or a few residues that typically adopt disordered coil conformations (DePristo et al., 2006) .

The three most common strategies to express disulfide-containing proteins, all of which are discussed later in this review, are to try the following: (1) target the expressed protein to the E. coli periplasm, which is highly oxidative (Leichert and Jakob, 2004) , (2) fuse the protein to thioredoxin (Lefebvre et al., 2009a) , and/or (3) express the protein in bacterial strains containing thioredoxin reductase and glutathione reductase mutants (Xu et al., 2008) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 304, "end": 326, "text": "(Stewart et al., 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF139"}, {"start": 508, "end": 531, "text": "(Veldkamp et al., 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF153"}, {"start": 532, "end": 553, "text": "Chen and Leong, 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 598, "end": 620, "text": "Tsumoto et al., (2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF148"}, {"start": 972, "end": 998, "text": "(Leichert and Jakob, 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF82"}, {"start": 1037, "end": 1061, "text": "(Lefebvre et al., 2009a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF80"}, {"start": 1183, "end": 1200, "text": "(Xu et al., 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF162"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Protein sequence"}, {"text": "Transmembrane segments.

The T7 RNA polymerase system is the most commonly used promoter system in E. coli. Gene expression is driven by the T7 RNA polymerase (from the T7 bacteriophage), which transcribes DNA five times faster than the bacterial RNA polymerase (Studier et al., 1990) . Because E. coli lacks this enzyme, the polymerase must be delivered to the cell, via an inducible plasmid or, more often, by using an E. coli strain that contains a chromosomal copy of the T7 polymerase gene (Studier and Moffatt, 1986b ). In the absence of an inducer, the polymerase, which itself is under the control of the lacUV5 promoter, is not produced, and correspondingly, the gene of interest is not transcribed (Studier et al., 1990) .

However, such robust transcription can have undesirable effects. First, even minimal basal production of T7 RNA polymerase results in \"leaky\" expression (expression prior to induction) of the target protein (Moffatt and Studier, 1987) . This can be detrimental if the protein is toxic to the host, resulting in cell death or growth arrest. To minimize leaky expression, several host strains Kikuchi et al., 1981; Miyake et al., 1985; Chang et al., 1986 . c See Shirakawa et al., 1984 Olins and Rangwala, 1990 . d See Delatorre et al., 1984 , Skerra, 1994 [i.e., BL21(DE3)pLysS, Rosetta(DE3)pLysS, Rosetta-gami(DE3)pLysS] have been developed that contain a plasmid encoding T7 lysozyme, an enzyme that binds and inhibits T7 polymerase (Moffatt and Studier, 1987) . The concentrations of T7 lysozyme produced in these strains are sufficient to inhibit basal transcription of target genes. However, it continues to inhibit T7 RNA polymerase after expression has been induced, and thus, it is typical for the level of recombinant protein expression to be significantly reduced in pLysS versus non-pLysS strains. For nontoxic proteins, this results in lower yields (Studier, 1991) . However, for toxic proteins, this often results in higher yields because the cell growth is not arrested prior to induction by the premature expression of the toxic protein (Yeo et al., 2009 ). In addition, because T7 is such a strong promoter, some translated proteins aggregate and form inclusion bodies because they fail to fold before encountering another unfolded protein. In these cases, expression parameters can be changed (see section IV) to maximize the yield of soluble, folded protein. Alternatively, a weaker promoter can be used. araBAD promoter. The arabinose promoter system (araBAD promoter) is a strong, titratable promoter which, unlike the T7 promoter, has almost no basal transcriptional activity (Lee et al., 1987) . Thus, it is advantageous for the expression of highly toxic proteins. The induction agent for this promoter is Larabinose (Lee et al., 1987) . In the absence of L-arabinose, transcription is exceptionally low and, if needed, can be even further suppressed by the addition of glucose (Miyada et al., 1984) . As reported by Guzman et al., protein expression levels increase linearly with increasing concentrations of L-arabinose over two logarithms (Guzman et al., 1995) . This allows the expression level to be titrated over a wide range of inducer concentrations, which can be important when trying to either maximize expression yields (higher L-arabinose concentrations) or to increase the yield of soluble protein (lower L-arabinose concentrations). It should be noted that although this system can efficiently repress gene expression, the repression level is not always zero and the efficiency of repression is gene dependent (Guzman et al., 1995) . Finally, studies that have directly compared protein yields from the araBAD and the T7 promoters have found that T7 promoters generally result in higher expression yields (Goulding and Perry, 2003) . For example, in our hands, we have seen protein expression yields increase by 2-to as much as 10-fold by switching from the araBAD to the T7 promoter system.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 153, "end": 181, "text": "(Studier and Moffatt, 1986b;", "ref_id": "BIBREF143"}, {"start": 182, "end": 203, "text": "Studier et al., 1990)", "ref_id": "BIBREF144"}, {"start": 413, "end": 440, "text": "(Moffatt and Studier, 1987)", "ref_id": "BIBREF92"}, {"start": 597, "end": 618, "text": "Kikuchi et al., 1981;", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 619, "end": 639, "text": "Miyake et al., 1985;", "ref_id": "BIBREF89"}, {"start": 640, "end": 658, "text": "Chang et al., 1986", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 659, "end": 689, "text": ". c See Shirakawa et al., 1984", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 690, "end": 714, "text": "Olins and Rangwala, 1990", "ref_id": "BIBREF105"}, {"start": 715, "end": 745, "text": ". d See Delatorre et al., 1984", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 746, "end": 760, "text": ", Skerra, 1994", "ref_id": "BIBREF135"}, {"start": 940, "end": 967, "text": "(Moffatt and Studier, 1987)", "ref_id": "BIBREF92"}, {"start": 1366, "end": 1381, "text": "(Studier, 1991)", "ref_id": "BIBREF141"}, {"start": 1557, "end": 1574, "text": "(Yeo et al., 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF165"}, {"start": 2102, "end": 2120, "text": "(Lee et al., 1987)", "ref_id": "BIBREF79"}, {"start": 2245, "end": 2263, "text": "(Lee et al., 1987)", "ref_id": "BIBREF79"}, {"start": 2406, "end": 2427, "text": "(Miyada et al., 1984)", "ref_id": "BIBREF88"}, {"start": 2570, "end": 2591, "text": "(Guzman et al., 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 3052, "end": 3073, "text": "(Guzman et al., 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 3247, "end": 3273, "text": "(Goulding and Perry, 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Promoter systems"}, {"text": "Hybrid promoters: trc and tac promoters.

Thus, it is often necessary to test multiple fusion tags to determine which tag results in the highest yields of soluble protein (Peti and Page, 2007; Brown et al., 2008) and to also use a combination of tags in order to facilitate both expression and purification (Nilsson et al., 1996; Pryor and Leiting, 1997; Routzahn and Waugh, 2002) .

His 6 -tagged fusion proteins are purified using immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC; Porath et al., 1975) . In IMAC, metal ions, typically nickel or cobalt, are immobilized to resin via a metal chelator, such as nitrilotriacetic acid, with only three or four of the six metal coordination sites occupied. The unprotonated histidines of the his 6 -tagged fusion protein coordinate the metal, allowing the expressed protein to be readily purified from E. coli lysate. The bound proteins are then eluted using either imidazole or by lowering the pH. Because this tag is small (<1 kD), it is frequently used in conjunction with solubility-enhancing fusion tags to provide a bi-functional tag that facilitates both solubility and purification.

The utility of SUMO as both an expression and solubilityenhancing tag has been demonstrated in multiple studies.

An additional method to produce disulfide bondcontaining proteins in E. coli is to export them to the periplasm, the space between the inner cytoplasmic membrane and the external outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria like E. coli. The bacterial periplasm is highly oxidative and thus promotes the formation of disulfide bonds (for a review of methods used to produce disulfide containing proteins in E. coli see de Marco, 2009). The E. coli maltose-binding protein is targeted to the periplasm in vivo via an N-terminal export signal sequence. Thus, when a construct of MBP that includes the export sequence is used as a fusion tag, the fusion protein is exported to the periplasm and, in turn, the oxidative environment promotes disulfide bond formation (Riggs, 2000) . Because MBP is used to target proteins both to the cytoplasm and to the periplasm, it is important to verify that the expression vector used localizes the target protein to the desired cellular compartment. In addition to MBP, DsbA, a Trx homolog, has also been used as a fusion partner to target and promote the proper folding of proteins in the periplasm (Collinsracie et al., 1995; Couprie et al., 2000; Winter et al., 2000) . Finally, it is important to point out that proteins targeted to the periplasm have specialized protocols for purification, which differ from those used for proteins targeted to the bacterial cytosol (Malik et al., 2007) . Position of fusion tag. All described solubility and affinity tags can be fused either to the N-or C-terminus of the target protein. However, N-terminal fusions are the most common and have the added benefit that they often enhance soluble protein expression more successfully than C-terminal fusions (Sati et al., 2002; Dyson et al., 2004; Busso et al., 2005) . One of the reasons N-versus C-terminally fused tags effectively improve protein expression and solubility is because many of the fusion tags are native E. coli proteins. Thus, they provide an efficient 5 sequence for the initiation of transcription (Esposito and Chatterjee, 2006) . Correspondingly, the N-terminal mRNA sequence and structure is efficiently recognized by the ribosome and compatible with robust translation (Cebe and Geiser, 2006) . In contrast, the transcription and translation initiation sites of target genes and proteins are variable and can impede these processes when tags are fused to the target protein C-terminus. Notably, there are exceptions, as MBP and SET tags have been shown to be equally effective in enhancing solubility regardless of which terminus they are fused to (Dyson et al., 2004; Zhang, Y.B. et al., 2004) , although this is still protein dependent. One tag that is often fused to the protein C-terminus is the his 6 -tag.
