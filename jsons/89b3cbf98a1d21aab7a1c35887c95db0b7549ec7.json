            "text": "Aspects of \"astrobiological\" research, such as searching for exoplanets, characterizing extremophilic microbes, and searching for biosignatures of ancient life undoubtedly offer important insights into the origin and evolution of life on Earth. Because of the important implications of such work, it is hardly surprising that claims of important breakthroughs often inspire heated debate -one famous example was the claim that the Martian meteorite ALH84001 contained fossilized life (McKay et al., 1996 ) . This claim required researchers to critically assess fossil and geochemical evidence with a new level of scrutiny, and it has been suggested that despite the consensus that this claim has been refuted, the academic debate has better prepared scientists to assess future evidence for ET (extraterrestrial) life (Dick and Strick, 2004 ) . While this may be true in a situation where conclusions can be subject to rigorous independent analysis, the fi eld of astrobiology also includes speculative research that is at present diffi cult, if not impossible, to independently test in the manner of the Martian meteorite (Rinaldi, 2007 ) .",

These authors suggest that microbial life is ubiquitous and persistent in the cosmos and serves as a constant source of inoculum and genetic material for new planets, contributing to evolutionary trends on each world. We use the structure of their hypothesis to inform discussion on the following questions about panspermia:",

            "text": "Mars is a planet that has long inspired speculation about extraterrestrial life (Pickering, 1921 ) , and the Viking Mars landers used some of the most sophisticated life-detecting instrumentation yet deployed anywhere outside the Earth to probe Martian soils for signs of microbial life. Three of the four experiments designed to test for the presence of life gave negative or ambiguous results (GC/ MS, gas exchange, and pyrolytic release experiments), but one fi nal test, the labeled release (LR) experiment, offered a striking positive response. This test, which aimed to detect the respiration of radioactively labeled organic compounds by microorganisms, yielded a strong positive result, with control experiments offering negative responses. The LR experiment was extensively fi eld-tested on Earth and was found to be sensitive to extremely small quantities of viable cells in extreme Earth environments, the closest we have to a Martian analogue. However, after the fact, this evidence was discounted in favor of an inorganic explanation that theorized that UV-produced peroxides in the Martian soil were responsible for the oxidation (Quinn and Zent, 1999 ) , despite the validity of these theories remaining questioned by the inventor of the apparatus, Gilbert Levin (Levin, 1981 (Levin, , 2007 ) . Levin's case has been bolstered by a recent investigation that suggested that the GC/MS experiment aboard the Viking would have been insensitive to the organic constituents of Antarctic soils, which are by no means devoid of life (Navarro-Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2006 ) . In addition to this, recent evidence of water ice under the Martian surface (Boynton et al., 2002 ) , in its atmosphere (Pearl et al., 2001 ) , as well as the discovery of seasonal methane emissions (Krashnopolsky et al., 2004 ) has led Levin to opine: \"What would be truly extraordinary in the light of present knowledge would be fi nding Mars to be sterile\" (Levin, 2007 ) . Despite this evidence, recent information obtained from Martian landers suggests an arid, acidic, and oxidizing early Mars (Squyres and Knoll, 2005 ) , and the recent unexpected discovery of perchlorate salts in the Martian soil (Hecht et al., 2009 ) , gives evidence for the presence of an oxidant that may yet convincingly explain the results of the LR experiments as abiotic. Future robotic missions that are slated for the current decade aim to clarify some of these questions by sampling up to 2 m below the Martian surface and may yet offer generally accepted signs of life on Mars (Rinaldi, 2007 ) . Other authors have described instruments that may overcome the limitations of the Viking GC/MS experiments by detecting PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) with higher sensitivity and distinguishing between enantiomers of amino acids (Bada, 2001 ) , though fi nal confi rmation may have to await proposed sample return missions (Schulze-Makuch and Irwin, 2002 ) .",

These microscopic fossils, which were originally characterized tentatively as cyanobacteria existing in a shallow sea bottom, were criticized based on their visual appearance as well as their geological context (Brasier et al., 2002 ) . Brasier et al. claimed that the fossils had morphology inconsistent with cyanobacteria and that they were in fact carbonaceous artifacts produced in a hydrothermal environment. This debate resulted in many follow-up publications by both Brasier and Schopf describing techniques for testing evidence, such as confi rmation of three-dimensional morphology , as well as a number of arguments about the placement of these fossils in a more robust geological context (Brasier et al., 2005 ) .",

Publications by Schopf and colleagues offer evidence to support the biogenicity of these fossils through more in-depth examinations of both morphology as well as the organic constituents of the microfossils (Schopf et al., , 2007 Schopf, 2006 ) . This debate is still far from over -new data suggests the structures are not in fact microfossils, though still indicative of microbial life (Marshall et al., 2011 ) . However, Brasier's most signifi cant achievement has been the reframing of the world where these ancient organisms existed, as well as their phylogenetic affi nities -no longer do paleontologists believe that these organisms were undoubtedly cyanobacteria existing in a temperate \"early Eden\" (Brasier et al., 2004 ) ; rather, they appear to have existed in a geologically active hydrothermal environment. This example is a cautionary tale -if Schopf 's picture of the early Earth as enshrined in textbooks can be so easily challenged, inferences made about life outside of Earth (that we have even less ability to directly study) may be overturned just as quickly. Purported ET (extraterrestrial) microfossils must be similarly examined with extreme caution with every attempt to confi rm the null hypothesis, before claims can be made that they represent unambiguous signs of life.",

Equally important to consider is the consistent argument by the proponents of this hypothesis that biological materials more exactly duplicate the emission/absorption spectra collected and therefore should be considered correct (Wickramasinghe, 2011 ) . Few would likely dispute that biological extracts as suggested by these authors create a more complex absorption/emission profi le that in some cases may better approximate astronomical data. However, it will be also clear to observers that nonbiological models produce a less complex spectrum because they are a simplifi cation in attempt to explain the data (Horneck, 1995 ) .",

This interpretation is not without controversy, as there are differing theories for the methane's origin (Fiebig et al., 2007 ) . In a similar vein, infrared spectroscopy has also been suggested to identify characteristic chemical bonds in the Europan ice sheets that may indicate biological activity (Dalton et al., 2003 ) . Outside of our solar system, the ambitious Darwin Project aims to track the presence of gases such as CO 2 , H 2 O, CH 4 , and O 2 in exoplanets . The analysis of the spectrum of a newly discovered exoplanet, a so-called hot Jupiter, has revealed the presence of all the previously mentioned gases in its atmosphere, with the exception of oxygen (Swain et al., 2009 ) . While the presence of methane in large gas giants is not regarded as evidence of life in our own solar system or elsewhere, the recent discovery of several rocky planets dubbed \"super Earths\" (Charbonneau et al., 2009 ) gives hope that we will soon discover a rocky planet with an atmosphere indicative of active biology.",

The possibility that these objects could carry viable life has led many to revisit the possibility of panspermia. This topic was ably reviewed by Horneck and Brack ( 1992 ) , who point out several mechanisms for particles to reach space, including volcanic eruptions, fl yby meteorites, and direct meteorite impacts. In these cases, both large pieces of rock as well as smaller particles would reach escape velocity. Large particles may travel to another planet by random chance (lithopanspermia), and smaller particles may be accelerated outwards from their parent star by radiation pressure or carried by interstellar particle clouds (radiopanspermia) (Horneck, 1995 ) . Aside from impacts, small particles may also be directly transported to space (Dehel, 2006 ) or created through subsequent impacts with other objects (Napier, 2004 ) . In this manner, we can imagine a small number of large meteorites and a larger number of smaller particles exiting a planet's surface, all with the potential to carry resistant forms of life.",

Known Martian meteorites took from between ~6.0 \u00d7 10 5 and up to ~14 million years to arrive on Earth (Eugster et al., 1997 ) , and radiopanspermia has been suggested to take a minimum of 10 6 years to reach a new planetary system although considerably less within a solar system (Secker et al., 1996 ) . While bacterial life has been claimed to be potentially viable for possibly up to millions of years (Vreeland et al., 2000 ) , this has been criticized on the basis that DNA is not thermodynamically stable enough to remain intact for this long (Graur and Pupko, 2001 ) and that there is possibility of contamination during sampling procedures that purport to isolate ancient life (Willerslev et al., 2004 ; Willerslev and Hebsgaard, 2005 ) . Even if contamination is ruled out, the thermodynamic argument remains strong since DNA is inherently unstable -experiments examining dormant bacteria trapped in Antarctic ice corroborate this line of reasoning (Bidle et al., 2007 ) , showing decreased viability of cells with an increased period of dormancy. In addition, the ability for DNA to remain viable may vary with phylogeny, with calculations suggesting that mesophiles are least likely to retain viable DNA over long periods, while thermophiles have a much better chance (Nicholson, 2003 ) .",

At this time, arguments that life is likely to be based on organic carbon polymers and existing in liquid water (the so-called carbaquist perspective (Fry, 2000 ) ) constrain the type of environments where life may exist. Liquid water may exist well below 0\u00b0C in some cases (Rothschild and Mancinelli, 2001 ) , and it may be possible for some organisms to have metabolic activity even below this level (Rivkina et al., 2000 ) . With this evidence in mind, Pace ( 2001 ) suggests a temperature range from \u221250\u00b0C to 200\u00b0C for the existence of life and less stringent requirements on pressure -an interesting experiment has recently demonstrated metabolic activity at gigapascal pressures (Sharma et al., 2002 ) . As evidence begins to accumulate for exoplanets that resemble Earth, Pace ( 2001 ) notes that an equally important question becomes the metabolic strategies organisms can potentially exploit to survive in extraterrestrial environments -all organisms, no matter the diversity of their metabolic strategies, require an infl ux of energy and a means of removing waste products. If we consider a putative space-faring organism colonizing a lifeless world, it would be a fair assumption that conditions may resemble the early Earth -that is, either with a neutral or partially reducing atmosphere and with a potential infl ux of organic compounds from comets and interstellar space (Horneck, 1995 ) . If we also assume some form of active geology, as well as light at a wavelength appropriate for photosynthesis, a high diversity of anaerobic strategies may succeed in these environments.",

These organisms, also known as chemoautotrophs, are able to fi x carbon wholly from inorganic chemicals in a process completely independent of photosynthesis. Chemosynthetic organisms exist in the most extreme and poorly understood regions of the Earth, including deep-sea vents where the oxidation of hydrogen sulfi de is coupled to carbon fi xation (Jannasch, 1985 ) , or deep crustal environments where hydrogen-based, hyperthermophilic subsurface lithoautotrophic microbial ecosystems (\"HyperSLiMEs\") exist completely independent of the surface biosphere (Takai et al., 2004 ) . Chemoautotrophs appear to be highly diverse (Nakagawa and Takai, 2008 ) , and iron-oxidizing bacteria can apparently survive on unsupplemented extracts of iron meteorites (Gonz\u00e1lez-Toril et al., 2005 ) . Speculation about extant life on Mars naturally tends to favor these ecosystems (Nealson et al., 2005 ) since they do not require a reduced carbon source and can thrive on common inorganic compounds. From the perspective of panspermia, this type of metabolism may be preferentially transferred by meteorite impacts since these organisms are most likely to be living within the interior of rocks.",

While there may be a selective pressure preventing the dispersal of cyanobacteria and other phototrophs (Cockell, 2008 ) , they are interesting to astrobiology for a number of reasons, including high radiation tolerance due to UV-absorbing compounds (Sinha and Hader, 2008 ) that are increasingly synthesized when exposed to stress such as desiccation (Fleming and Castenholz, 2007 ) . Many cyanobacteria remain viable after long periods of time in dark permafrost soils (Vishnivetskaya et al., 2003 ) , although it appears that the resistant cells, known as akinetes, have limited resistance to the rigors of space unless shielded from radiation (Olsson-Francis et al., 2009 ) . These organisms can survive at extremely low irradiances and extremes of pH and temperature and can switch their photosynthetic metabolism from oxygenic to anoxygenic under differing conditions (Garcia-Pichel and Castenholz, 1990 ) .",

Indeed, theoretical analysis of the supposed \"last universal common ancestor\" (LUCA) on Earth has suggested that \"[the] LUCA does not appear to have been a simple, primitive, hyperthermophilic prokaryote but rather a complex community of protoeukaryotes with RNA genomes, adapted to a broad range of moderate temperatures, genetically redundant, morphologically and metabolically diverse\" (Glansdorff et al., 2008 ) .

Wilkinson ( 2003 ) has considered this topic in depth and suggests that diverse metabolic strategies are necessary to maintain an active biosphere.

On Earth, cyanobacteria are known to have a low threshold for cadmium toxicity, which is explained by the fact that the environment in which they originally evolved contained less free cadmium due to a different oxidation state (Saito et al., 2003 ) . It is also equally possible that life may be metabolically adaptable in ways we have yet to discover -a new report of bacteria that purportedly use arsenate to replace the biological function of phosphate offers support for this notion (Wolfe-Simon et al., 2011a ) . However, at the time of writing, the methodology of this study has been widely discussed and criticized (Benner, 2011 ; Borhani, 2011 ; Cotner and Hall, 2011 ; Csabai and Szathmary, 2011 ; Foster, 2011 ; Oehler, 2011 ; Redfi eld, 2011 ; Rosen et al., 2011 ; Schoepp-Cothenet et al., 2011 ) , with the report's claims and response to comments (Wolfe-Simon et al., 2011b ) at this point appearing inconclusive at best.",

Wickramasinghe et al. ( 2009 ) have also claimed that comets could allow for liquid water near perihelion based on surface temperatures above 300 K. However, the assertion that life evolved and persists in comets has been roundly criticized (Horneck, 1995 ) . Bar-Nun et al. ( 1981 ) also point out that comets may not have the structural integrity necessary to contain liquid water and that any organic compounds produced on the surface through interactions with stellar UV radiation would be sublimated at perihelion. In addition, it has been noted that organisms thus far claimed to be inhabitants of comets show no specifi c adaptations to that niche (Jalasvuori et al., 2009 ; Vaidya, 2010 ) .",

It is also conceivable that the origin of life is much more probable than Hoyle and Wickramasinghe consider -this would be supported if we were able to discover biochemically distinct forms of life on Earth that are the product of a unique origin. Some authors have suggested searching for \"\u2026opposite chirality biomarkers, nonracemic mixtures of biological material, or anomalous ratios of stable isotopes that cannot be explained by abiotic or normal biotic processes\" (Davies and Lineweaver, 2005 ) . Other evidence may come from investigating phenomena such as \"desert varnish\" which appear biological but have not been satisfactorily explained (Cleland, 2007 ; Davies et al., 2009 ) . The discovery of these hypothesized \"shadow biospheres\" would offer evidence that the origin of life is highly probable given clement conditions. Any such discovery would, in the opinion of some authors, be more signifi cant than evidence for a successful panspermia event since it would inform the probability of life originating not just on Earth, but throughout the universe (Shapiro and Schulze-Makuch, 2009 ) .",

This early appearance of life, combined with evidence suggesting that many complex biochemical processes were present in the LUCA, has led Line ( 2002 ) to consider that an extraterrestrial origin of life was necessary to provide suffi cient time for these evolutionary innovations to develop. How much time was available for early life to evolve from a \"prebiotic\" state to life as we know it is still unknown -it has been recently suggested that early \"sterilizing impacts\" were not suffi cient to wipe out thermophiles (Abramov and Mojzsis, 2009 ) and that Earth could have been reseeded by impact ejecta (Wells et al., 2003 ) , in which case life may have had more time to develop on Earth than previously supposed. Evidence for this period of Earth's history is missing from the geological record, though it may be preserved as ejected meteorites on the moon or other bodies (Crawford et al., 2008 ) . Line ( 2002 ) has suggested that we may be able to confi rm evidence for the evolution of life on Earth elsewhere in the universe if we were to discover life on Mars or Europa that was genetically related to Earthly life. There are naturally pitfalls in any potential interpretation of such data, and Ebach et al. ( 2008a ) caution us to heed the past failures of biogeography and not seek to draw conclusions where data is scanty or lacking. This viewpoint earned criticism from ardent supporters of panspermia as geocentric (Wallis et al., 2008 ) though it has been noted that at this point, we cannot help but be \"geocentric\" (Ebach et al., 2008b ) . The discovery of biochemically related life would be unlikely to quell this debate since it would undoubtedly be diffi cult to resolve its provenance (Pace, 2001 ) . Indeed, it is likely that the discovery of ET life would only deepen the mystery of our origins.",

The debates over the ALH84001 meteorite as well as the Apex Chert microfossils were possible because multiple parties could analyze the same samples critically and have done much to give us a clearer picture of the challenges that will undoubtedly face scientists as we gain more information about life in the universe -the same rigorous debate, with falsifi able hypotheses, is essential for any serious discussion of panspermia. Such debate is now going on regarding the possible substitution of arsenic for phosphorus in DNA, another problem put forward as one of astrobiology (Wolfe-Simon et al., 2011a ) . Carl Sagan's \"Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence\" (Sagan, 1979 ) , stated in the context of UFOs (unidentifi ed fl ying objects) has seemed to plague astrobiologists. But in science do we really only require \"ordinary\" evidence for \"ordinary\" claims? We suggest not, that is, that all claims in science are open to the same degree of scrutiny. The strongest claims are those that have passed the most scrutiny. The record for panspermia claims in this ordinary science regard is spotty. We are presently faced with the unproven belief that life could be widespread in the universe, fortifi ed by the presence of organic matter in meteorites and elsewhere, contrasted with our certainty that life exists on earth. That should be enough to motivate us to continue the search, with humility: I fi nd that as beginners in this business most people are brash but after they have stayed in it a while, they tend to become more humble. I am very humble. Harold C. Urey in: (Laurence, 1961 ) Current research on the diversity and limits of microbial life, the discovery and investigation of extrasolar planets, and new scientifi c missions to bodies in our solar system are most likely to offer clear and uncontroversial evidence for astrobiology. It is, however, important to note that even with unambiguous proof of ET life, controversy over its origin is unlikely to be resolved anytime soon. Whether life on Earth began solely here or was transferred from elsewhere, both panspermia and origin of life research will likely have complementary parts to play in probing these mysteries.",
