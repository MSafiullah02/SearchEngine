            "text": "Acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE) is a rare but rapidly progressing encephalopathy, characterized by seizures and rapid alteration of consciousness, which may progress to coma within days after the onset of febrile infection such as influenza A or parainfluenza, without direct invasion of the central nervous system [1]. Neuroimaging typically shows multiple symmetric brain lesions affecting the thalamus and the brainstem, periventricular white matter, and cerebellum [1]. Most cases are sporadic; however, several cases of familial or recurrent ANE were reported recently in North America and Europe [2], [3], [4]. Patients with mutations in the RANBP2 gene (OMIM601181) have been identified; the gene encodes the nuclear pore component of Ran binding protein 2, causing genetic susceptibility to ANE [2], [3], [4]. Herein, we report the first case of siblings with familial ANE due to RANBP2 mutation from Northeast Asia.",

She was born at term with uneventful ante- and perinatal periods. Her immunizations were up to date according to the Korean immunization schedule. Seven hours after the first seizure, she developed repetitive seizures and unresponsiveness and became comatose. She was admitted to the intensive care unit with hypotension and respiratory compromise. Laboratory findings, including liver function tests and ammonia levels, were normal. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis was normal except for an elevated protein level (protein: 523 mg/dl, glucose: 93 mg/dl). The patient was empirically started on vancomycin, cefotaxime, and acyclovir to treat possible meningoencephalitis. Computed tomography (CT) revealed low attenuation in the bilateral thalamus and diffuse effacement of the sulci and lateral ventricles, indicating diffuse cerebral edema (Fig. 1\n). Despite treatment in intensive care and immunosuppressive therapy including intravenous methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg/day for 2 days) and immunoglobulin (1 g/kg/day for 2 days), the patient died 2 days after the onset of initial neurological symptoms. Results of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for respiratory viruses (parainfluenza, influenza, corona virus, rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, bocavirus, and enterovirus) and herpes simplex viruses in the CSF as well as the results from cultures for bacteria in the CSF, serum, and urine were all negative.",

Chest X-ray revealed perihilar infiltration indicating pneumonia. In the next 4 h, she became lethargic and unresponsive. CSF analysis did not show pleocytosis but an elevated protein level (protein: 264 mg/dl, glucose: 63 mg/dl). Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed T2 hyperintensities in the bilateral thalamus, external/extreme capsule, brainstem, and cerebral and cerebellar white matter (Fig. 2\n). Antibiotics and antiviral agents were administered, followed by intravenous methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg/day for 5 days) and immunoglobulin (1 g/kg/day for 2 days).

Since the first description of ANE in 1995 [1], numerous cases of sporadic ANE have been reported. In 2009, Neilson et al. reported multiple affected family members with acute necrotizing encephalopathy [2]. They identified a recurrent missense mutation (c.1754C > T: p.Thr585Met, c.1958C > T: p.Thr653Ile, c.1966A > G: p.Ile656Val) in the RANBP2 gene in a large multigenerational family with autosomal-dominant ANE and concluded this gene mutation predisposes patients to increased susceptibility to familial ANE with an estimated 40% penetrance [2]. Hence, the sporadic form is referred to as ANE, and the familial/recurrent form with RANBP2 mutation is referred to as ANE1 with various clinico-radiological presentations [4]. However, the pathogenic mechanism of RANBP2 mutation for ANE1 remains unclear. Several authors believe that RANBP2 may be a critical modulator of neuronal activity, glucose catabolism, and energy homeostasis [2], [6]. However, there are case reports of familial and recurrent ANE without RANBP2 mutation, suggesting a heterogeneous genetic contribution to ANE [7]. Till date, 61 patients with RANBP2 mutation-positive ANE have been reported in American and European populations [4], [8] but only one case of recurrent ANE with RANBP2 mutation has been reported from Asia (an Indian child) [9].",
