COVID-19 is emerged as a respiratory infection and a suspicious origin of animals and transmission to human in Wuhan, China on December 2019. Later this, the virus was transmitted from person to person through droplets and contacts. The World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the National Health Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China have taken immediate action to reduce transmission and fatality associated with COVID-19 as minimum as possible. However, action has failed to stop transmission of COVID-19 from China to other countries.[1-3] This COVID-19 majorly affects lungs, which cause pneumonia and further damages kidney, heart, liver, etc., due to failure in the defensive mechanism (less immunity). COVID-19 is a family of coronaviruses (CoVs) that are phenotypically and genotypically diverse. CoVs are enveloped viruses containing single standard positive-sense RNA that belongs to Coronaviridae family of the ortho Coronaviridae subfamily which can cause illness in birds, mammals, and humans.[4]",
