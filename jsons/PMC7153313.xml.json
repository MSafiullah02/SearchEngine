The quality of colostrum can be measured through the use of a hydrometer specific for colostrum (also known as a colostrometer) or with a refractometer. Using a colostrometer requires that the colostrum must be at room temperature otherwise over- or underestimation of the IgG in the colostrum is possible. Good quality colostrum is when the IgG concentration is \u2265 50 g/L. Using a refractometer only requires two drops of colostrum and it does not need to be at room temperature. High-quality colostrum has a refractometer reading of approximately 25% Brix. Brix is a measurement of the sugar content but in colostrum, it measures the total solids content which correlates positively to the IgG concentration in colostrum. Four liters of good quality colostrum should be fed as soon as possible after birth and another 2 L should be fed within 12 h after calving. Colostrum must be provided; if the calf does not drink the colostrum it must be provided via an esophageal feeder.",

In the development of a model to predict colostrum quality, days above 25\u00b0C increased colostrum quality.6 In the laboratory, IgG concentration is typically determined using radial immunoassay. A similar result was observed in heat stressed cows, however, these researchers found that while colostrum quality was similar in heat stressed and cooled cows the absorption of IgG by their calves was less.7 Cows in this experiment experienced similar temperature humidity indexes, but cooled cows had access to sprinklers and fans while heat stressed cows did not. This effect carried over into reduced weaning weight and milk production when the calves began to lactate. These data indicate that while the increased environmental temperature (>25\u00b0C) may increase colostrum quality6 it reduces the uptake by the calves.7 Therefore, providing cows with shade and fans as a means of heat abatement will enhance the uptake of IgG and possibly other beneficial nutrients and growth factors.",

This is likely due to a dilution effect of colostrum in the Holstein. Generally, first parity cows also produce lesser quality colostrum. This is likely due to first lactation cows having a more na\u00efve immunity in comparison to cows with more parturitions. It appears that this is becoming less of an issue through improved nutrition of these cows prior to parturition. Recently, it has been observed that the Jersey breed will produce very little colostrum during the winter months in the northern hemisphere.8 The effect was observed more for cows with greater than one parity and appears to be correlated with photoperiod (day-length).",

            "text": "Milk replacer feeding has changed in recent years with the development of higher protein milk replacers (up to 32%). This is sometimes referred to as the accelerated feeding program. Also with the development of self-feeders, calves have been observed to consume upwards of 10 L of reconstituted milk per day. Results are fairly consistent with growth rates exceeding approximately 300 g/d greater in calves fed a 28:20 (protein: fat) at about 1.3 kg of milk replacer powder/d compared to calves receiving 560 g of conventional (22:20) milk replacer powder (750 vs. 460 g/d respectively).12 However, weaning can be difficult when calves are fed such a nutrient dense and large amount of milk powder. Weaning is typically determined by measuring how much starter grain the calf is consuming (227 g/d for three consecutive days). Often calves receive half of their milk replacer for 7 days. This forces the calf to consume more of its nutrients from the starter. Consequently, this is often a stressful time in the calf's life. There has been a large amount of research conducted to evaluate how calves can be effectively weaned with reduced stress. This has led to utilizing a step-down procedure where calves are provided less milk replacer over several days. Calves fed the high protein milk replacer gained only 80\u2013150 g/d compared to the conventionally fed calves who gained approximately 640 g/d during this period.12 After weaning, there were no differences in average daily gain regardless of treatment. One aspect of feeding high quantity and high protein milk replacer is the necessity to feed water. While milk and milk replacer is effectively shunted past the rumen, water consumed by the calf will go directly into the rumen. However, if the water is not provided, calves can become dehydrated due to osmotic balance being compromised from the high protein and mineral content provided in the milk replacer. Research has shown that water intake was increased when calves were fed the accelerated milk replacer program compared to calves fed a conventional milk replacer feeding regimen.13\n",

Some researchers have observed that mammary gland milk-producing tissue was 5.9 times more in calves fed higher levels of milk replacer based on metabolizable energy suggesting that greater protein from milk replacer consumption was beneficial to mammary gland development during the pre-weaning phase.14 Evaluating data from a university herd and a commercial herd also showed that increased average daily gain during the pre-weaning phase translated into more milk when the calves became cows between 850 and 1,113 kg of milk for every additional kg of preweaning gain.15 Other researchers have evaluated feed intake as it pertains to future production. Researchers evaluated nine studies and found that during the preruminant phase average daily gain between 0.3 and 0.5 kg/d had little effect on future milk production.16 However, they found that first-lactation milk yield was enhanced when the pre-weaning average daily gain was between 0.5 and 0.9 kg/d. These researchers also found that other farm management variables affected first-lactation milk yield.16 In another study, researchers observed that for every 1 kg of average daily gain during the first six to eight weeks of life translated into an additional 544 kg of milk in first-lactation.17 Unlike the other study,15 calves in this data set were fed a conventional milk replacer (22%: 20%).17 In conclusion, optimizing growth during the pre-weaning phase will likely increase future milk production.",

            "text": "To take advantage of the growth realized during the pre-weaning phase it is critical to feed the post-weaned heifer correctly. Goals to be obtained is to feed these heifers so they weigh about 55% of their calving weight at breeding (13\u201315 mos) and 82%\u201385% of mature weight at parturition (22\u201324 months). While most farms do not have scales, utilizing weigh tapes are an accurate way of determining heifer body weights. Also, measuring withers heights may be another easy way of determining the size according to breed. Generally, heifers that are taller at the withers at calving produce more milk than shorter heifers.18 Nutrient requirements for the large-breed heifer vary as the heifer grows and when she becomes pregnant at around 400 kg (Table 9.2\n). Typically these heifers are fed a high forage diet as forages can typically meet these nutrient requirements. However, recently researchers found that feeding according to the NRC19 data set, the maintenance requirements were overestimated by up to 30%.20 It was observed that the growth rates of heifers in a study from preweaning through calving required less ME than the NRC (2001) suggested.21 These data suggest that the NRC19 overestimates the energy requirements for post-weaned heifers. Immediately postweaning, the tissue energy content of gain is the lowest of any point during the growth phase.20 These authors state that this is because the rumen and gastrointestinal tract would gain the most mass as it develops to process solid feed.20 As the animal grows up to 350 kg, protein in gain (g/kg) remains flat, but fat in gain (g/kg) increases except at weaning because of rumen development as described above .20 Through a series of equations, it can be calculated that a 219 kg heifer requires 2.16 Mcal of net energy of gain. This accounts for the body composition relative to maturity. Without accounting for maturity the requirement is estimated to be 2.69 Mcal of net energy of gain as suggested by the NRC.19 Feeding at this rate (2.69 Mcal) would result in overly fat heifers. The equations indicate that a large-breed heifer should gain 0.87 kg/d during the post-weaning phase.",

The concept of precision feeding is providing exactly what the heifer needs to reach its growth requirements. Precision feeding has many benefits to the producer including less chance of over-conditioned heifers, decreased feed costs, and less waste production. Growth is targeted at 0.8 kg/d while meeting all the needs of the post-weaned heifer. Over the entire period, crude protein is set at 14%\u201315% for heifers, while metabolizable energy ranges from 3.01 Mcal/kg to 2.84 Mcal/kg of intake as the heifer grows (Table 9.3\n). Neutral detergent fiber ranges from 23% to 35% and all minerals and vitamins are similar to the requirements in the NRC.19 When precision-feeding heifers, adequate bunk space is required because all heifers need to be able to eat at the same time because they will likely consume their entire daily feed allotment in 1 h. Adequate water intake must be provided. Body weight within a pen should range no more than 90 kg and age variation should be no more than two months per group. Heifers should be taped every time they are handled or at least once a month and diets should be adjusted accordingly. Researchers also recommend that weighing heifers should occur at the same time to account for gut-fill. Bunk space should be between 36 and 61 cm as the animal grows. Avoid wood shavings or straw as bedding as heifers will consume these products. Heifers should be fed the prefresh cow diet 30\u201345 days before parturition. During this time gut volume will increase without problems.\n",

Water makes up between 56% and 81% of total body weight in the dairy cow25 and between 68% and 72% in the preruminant calf.26 Water is essential for the transport of substances around the body, temperature regulation, insulation, and removal of wastes. As described earlier, water is essential for rumen microbial development in the preruminant calf and ultimately critical in the conversion of the calf from non-ruminant to ruminant (see calf and heifer section). Sources of water are either free-water (drinking water), feed water and water from endogenous reactions. The major source of water for cattle is free water intake. Therefore, anything that limits free water intake will hamper animal performance. As would be expected, free water intake increases as milk production increases. Water intake also increases when the cow is in an environment where the temperature humidity index is above 68. According to the equation of Murphy et al. 27, free water intake ranges from 92 to 138 L/d. This equation accounts for feed intake (dry matter), milk yield, sodium intake, and minimum temperature. Recently, Appuhamy et al. 28 derived two equations that are now considered the equations to use when estimating free water intake for lactating cows. According to Kononoff24, these equations are now recommended for determining free water intake. Eq. (9.1) utilizes dry feed intake, while Eq. (9.2) utilizes milk yield.

In most animals, there are ten essential amino acids with the remainder considered non-essential. That said, there are some amino acids that are considered limiting for production. These limiting amino acids are based on the diet fed to the cattle. For instance, in the US, corn and soybean meal are the primary sources of energy and protein in dairy cattle diets. Corn is usually fed in two ways, as silage, and as a grain. Corn is known to be deficient in the essential amino acid lysine. Soybean co-products are typically the primary protein supplement supplemented with corn feedstuffs. Soybean feedstuffs are deficient in the amino acid methionine. Therefore, these amino acids (lysine and methionine) are considered to be co-limiting in US dairy diets.19 This means that protein synthesis and yield are limited by the amount of these amino acids in the cow's diet. Supplementing other essential amino acids will not compensate for these. Typically, a source of protein that will be undegraded in the rumen (such as blood or fish meal) and high in these particular amino acids will be included in the diet to help compensate for the deficiency. Diets fed to cows that are high in grass silage and pasture with barley and oats such as those found in Northern Europe typically will be adequate in Lys and Met, but deficient in histidine.29\n",

Neutral detergent fiber is that material that remains after digesting a dried and ground sample in boiling, neutral detergent solution for 1 h. The material will comprise of cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, and any N bound to the fiber. The recommended concentration of NDF to feed is close to 27%\u201328% of the diet DM for lactating cows.19 Primary sources of NDF are hays, silage, pasture, and roughages. Acid detergent fiber (ADF) is what remains after NDF is boiled in acidic detergent solution for 1 h. In this process, hemicellulose is lost and cellulose and lignin remain. Therefore hemicellulose = % NDF- % ADF. There are different ways to determine lignin content including heating in KMnO4, or 72% H2SO4. Klason lignin is the difference between the residue after acid hydrolysis and the ash remaining after heating the residue in a muffle furnace at a high temperature for 3 h (ash). These remove the cellulose and leaves the remaining lignin. Therefore, ADF - lignin = cellulose. Lignin is not appreciably digested and increases as the plants mature. Lignin and ADF are negatively correlated with digestibility. Therefore, it is appropriate that dairy producers harvest forage early in their growth cycle (grass-pre-boot, legume pre-bud) to take advantage of higher digestibility.",

Older animals are less efficient in absorbing Ca, possibly due to reduced 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D receptors on the intestine which stimulate Ca uptake. Cows experience negative Ca balance until they are post-peak. This is due to the Ca requirement needed for high milk production. Calcium absorption increases 160% from one day prior to calving until eight days later. The calcium requirement for lactating cows is variable, with a minimum of 0.61% of the diet (DM basis)19 but can be increased to 1% especially when feeding additional fat in the diet. Besides hypocalcemia, deficiency is rare with a bone deformity known as rickets and osteomalacia in older cows. Besides structure and feed prehension, Ca is needed for smooth muscle function and nerve impulse. Cows that experience hypocalcemia can also experience retained placenta due to the inability for the uterus to contract to release it. Mastitis can also occur as the keratin plug (an antibacterial physical barrier present in the streak canal) falls out due to the relaxation of the muscles within the teat end. This results in the ability for bacteria to enter the teat cistern and gland cistern of the hypocalcemic cow. Other disorders can occur such as ketosis due to reduced gastrointestinal tract motility and low caloric intake. Good sources of Ca include green forages and limestone.",

They are active in the rumen by reducing the numbers of Gram-positive bacteria and thereby enhancing the numbers of Gram-negative bacteria causing an increase in the production of propionate. This volatile fatty acid is primarily used by ruminants as the precursor of glucose. Heifers that are fed ionophores have improved growth efficiency (Gain/Feed). Lactating cows fed monensin are less prone to ketosis due to the presence of more propionate and ketosis is essentially a deficiency of glucose. Ionophores disrupt the cell membrane of Gram-positive bacteria resulting in their death.

Open areas with rails or cables do not provide for cows to be able to eat as cows are hierarchical animals and a boss cow can control a large part of the bunk.

The first theory is bulk, as NDF in the diet increases, feed intake decreases due to stretch receptors in the rumen wall signaling satiety. The second is based on energy intake. Diets based on high-energy will result in reduced intake when the energy requirement is met. This theory will only work in late lactation and during the dry period when cows can eat to meet caloric requirements. The third theory and the one most likely observed is the oxygen consumption theory. As cows produce more milk, the need for the blood to carry oxygen to tissues is increased, and the heart must pump at a faster rate and consumption of oxygen increases. More nutrients are provided to the mammary gland resulting in a greater need for nutrient uptake and hence greater feed intake.",

            "text": "The lactation cycle of a dairy cow includes a dry or non-lactating phase. The typical lactation lasts 305 days and during this time the cow should get pregnant usually between 60 and 90 days but before 100 days. The dry period typically lasts 60 days during this period the calf is growing and the mammary gland undergoes involution. The diet is typically a high forage diet and the nutrient requirements are in Table 9.5\n19. Beginning about 3\u20135 weeks before the cow is expected to calve, the diet is changed to a higher concentrate diet. This serves several purposes including providing more nutrients to the growing calf and the cow as dry matter intake begins to drop as the cow approaches parturition. Also, the rumen microbiota need to change to reflect the diet fed after parturition. This change in diet also causes the rumen papillae to lengthen resulting in more surface area for nutrient absorption. This can help reduce post calving metabolic disorders such as lactic acidosis and ketosis. These cows are typically fed a negative DCAD (mEq/kg) diet to reduce the chance of hypocalcemia post-calving. Jersey cows seem to be more prone to hypocalcemia than other breeds.",
