            "text": "Cell being the structural and functional unit of human body have a genetic code that governs the proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis [1]. Before the cell proliferation, DNA duplication is a controlled process, where any defect in base pair sequencing is repaired. However, an impaired DNA replication may elicit a range of aberrant cell signaling with a potential to trigger the transformation of cells from normal to neoplastic lineage. These defiant cells tend to divide at an uncontrolled pace that precipitates into a tumor [2]. Tumor cells rewire their metabolism to promote growth, survival, proliferation and long-term maintenance through increased uptake of glucose and its fermentation to lactate (Warburg effect) [3]. These cells in spite of competing for resources and space also cooperate with each other by secreting diffusible factors that promote tumor growth and invasion through metastasis [[4], [5], [6]]. Metastasis is the primary cause of mortality in cancer comprising sequential steps for cancer cells dissemination from primary sites and secondary tumor growth at distant region. Disseminated cancer cells can grow out and form secondary tumors in distant area through invasion into local stroma and intravasation into vascular circulation [7]. The interaction between the cancer cells and microenvironment is essential for cancer progression. However, only a small fraction of the disseminated cells called metastatic stem cells are able to grow and overlap the important signaling pathways of normal cells such as Wnt, Notch and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) essential for metastatic progression [8]. The overexpression of c-erbB2 gene a member of erbB receptor tyrosine kinase family leads to cell proliferation, migration and survival [[9], [10], [11]]. For many decades, clinicians are trying to encounter cancerous cells within the biological system, but they are camouflaged in billions of normal cells making them difficult to wipe out completely.",

Owing to promising biological potential of benzoxazinone scaffold, a small library of benzoxazinone with a range of substituents were designed and synthesized. Synthesis of 7-nitro-2-aryl-4H-benzo[d] [1,3]oxazin-4-ones (3a-k) was accomplished under convenient reaction conditions. In the present work target benzoxazinones (3a-k) were formed in good yields when 4-nitroanthranilic acid (1) was reacted with a range of benzoyl chlorides (2a-k) in the presence of pyridine as organic base. Various functional group were introduced onto benzoxazinone scaffold to access desired library of synthetic compounds (3a-k). These newly synthesized compounds were evaluated for their anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic potential in HeLa (human cervical cancer cell lines). For this purpose, MTT assay was utilized for anti-proliferative potential of all synthesized in the current study. Pro-apoptotic potential was investigated by using Hoechst 33258 staining assay. Whereas antioxidant properties of synthesized benzoxazinones (3a-k) were determined via DPPH free radical scavenging assay to compare antioxidant activity with anticancer potential of synthesized compounds. Proliferation of cells in percentage was investigated by MTT assay. This assay clearly demonstrates significance of anti-proliferative and cytotoxic potential of synthesized compounds (3a-k) on HeLa cancerous cells. Therefore, apoptotic effect was further evaluated by using Hoechst 33258 staining assay and fluorescence microscope was employed to further understand the cytological alterations in cancerous cells. Finally, docking studies was also performed for compounds to evaluate binding affinity and inhibition constant (Ki).",

The caspase enzyme activity is typically controlled by the presence of leucine residue. Literature also reveals that the mutation of the leucine residues greatly decreases the enzyme activity. The presence of leucine residue on the L2 loop plays an exceptional role in maintaining the catalytic activity of caspases [30]. Moreover, leucine deficiency also triggers apoptotic death of cancerous cells [31].

All the ligands with different groups bound with same binding pocket and almost with the same residues with slight difference in number of residues and bond type. The docking score indicated the strength of bond formed and helped us to find the inhibitor constant (Ki). The inhibitor constant has vital importance in drug designing because it specifies the inhibition potential to yield half concentration after inhibition. The Ki has inevitable effect on IC50 affecting the mode of action of drug. Smaller the Ki value better will be the IC50 [1]. Table 1 showed the results of docking score, Ki values and nature of binding interactions.
