In this study, antioxidant potential of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in dogs infected with canine parvovirus with a nonblinded randomized clinical trial has been carried out. A total 18 parvo-infected dogs were randomly divided into two groups: nine parvo-infected dogs were treated with supportive treatment and nine parvo-infected dogs were treated with NAC along with supportive treatment. Simultaneously, nine healthy dogs were kept as healthy control. In parvo-infected dogs, marked hemoconcentration, leucopenia, neutropenia and oxidative stress were noticed compared to healthy dogs. The NAC treatment progressively improved the leukocyte, neutrophil, monocyte, and eosinophil counts over the time in parvovirus-infected dogs compared to dogs that received only supportive treatment. In addition, NAC treatment significantly improved glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity and decreased nitrite plus nitrate (NOx) and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations on day 3 and 5 compared to supportive treatment in parvo-infected dogs. However, supportive treatment alone failed to ameliorate oxidative stress in the infected dogs till day 5.

In contrast, hemoconcentration in this study might be due to excessive fluid loss during the episodes of diarrhea. Furthermore, leucopenia and neutropenia are the major hemogram alterations in the parvo-infected dogs (Castro et al., 2013) . The leukopenia and neutropenia in parvo-infected dogs could be due to destruction of hematopoietic progenitor cells of the various leukocyte types in the bone marrow, inadequate supply for the massive demand for leukocytes in the inflamed gastrointestinal tract and loss of neutrophils through the damaged gastrointestinal tract (Macartney, McCandlish, Thompson, & Cornwell, 1984; Fulton et al., 199; Goddard, Leisewitz, Christopher, Duncan, & Becker, 2008 Much has been learned about the beneficial effect of antioxidants against viral diseases in recent years (Beck, 2001; Peterhans, 1997; Zhang, Wang, Chen, Chen, & Tian, 2014) . Studies derived from influ- . The mean GST activity significantly elevated on day 5 (p = .035) from pretreatment value (day 0) in ST-NAC treated dogs, whereas no significant changes was observed in parvo-infected dogs received ST only. The average MDA and NOx concentrations significantly reduced on day 5 (p = .035, .039) from pretreatment value (day 0) in ST-NAC treated dogs, whereas no significant changes was observed in parvo-infected dogs received ST only. A statistically significant interaction was found between treatment and NOx concentration (p = .036) but, such interaction was not present for GST activity (p = .063) and MDA concentrations (p = .100). Superscripts A, B between the groups within a day and superscripts a, b between the days within the group differ significantly (p < .05) (Kurutas, Cetinkaya, Bulbuloglu, & Kantarceken,2005; Viviano & Wielen, 2013 (Dekhuijzen, 2004; Garigliany & Desmecht, 2011; Guerrero, Torres, Garc\u00eda, Guerrero, & Acosta, 2014) . From the findings of this study, it can be concluded that antioxidants like NAC represent a potential additional treatment option that could be considered in the case of parvoviral diarrhea. However, the therapeutic efficacy of NAC involving large number of dogs with parvovirus infection needs further study to extract the full potential of the compounds with comprehensive results.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 871, "end": 891, "text": "(Grimes & Fry, 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 892, "end": 912, "text": "Nandi & Kumar, 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 913, "end": 957, "text": "Stann, DiGiacomo, Giddens, & Evermann, 1984)", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 1177, "end": 1198, "text": "(Castro et al., 2013)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1530, "end": 1581, "text": "(Macartney, McCandlish, Thompson, & Cornwell, 1984;", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1582, "end": 1601, "text": "Fulton et al., 199;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1602, "end": 1657, "text": "Goddard, Leisewitz, Christopher, Duncan, & Becker, 2008", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1763, "end": 1775, "text": "(Beck, 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1776, "end": 1792, "text": "Peterhans, 1997;", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 1793, "end": 1831, "text": "Zhang, Wang, Chen, Chen, & Tian, 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 2637, "end": 2689, "text": "(Kurutas, Cetinkaya, Bulbuloglu, & Kantarceken,2005;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2690, "end": 2712, "text": "Viviano & Wielen, 2013", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 2713, "end": 2731, "text": "(Dekhuijzen, 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2732, "end": 2760, "text": "Garigliany & Desmecht, 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2761, "end": 2812, "text": "Guerrero, Torres, Garc\u00eda, Guerrero, & Acosta, 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "| DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "We acknowledge Director IVRI for providing facilities to carry out the work.

Oxidative stress has been implicated in several viral infections in human and animals.
