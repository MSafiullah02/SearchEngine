Prior to the pandemic, healthcare providers had to be licensed in the state where the patient was located and Medicare/Medicaid covered only remote patient visits that occurred from eligible sites, which included offices, clinics, and hospitals, but not homes.5 Currently, emergency waivers from governmental agencies now allow healthcare providers to see patients from out of state (though not all), telemedicine visits from home are now reimbursable, videoconferencing with non-Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant applications (such as FaceTime and Facebook Messenger) is acceptable, and prescriptions for controlled substances are now possible without a prior in-person evaluation.5 Most private insurers have followed suit with the government and are allowing reimbursement for telemedicine visits.",

The application Zoom (San Jose, California), which had previously been used by our neurosurgery department for remote conferences, is our preferred method for delivering telemedicine due to its HIPAA compliance and familiarity of use. This technology also has features like \u201cbreakout rooms,\u201d which allow telemedicine visits to closely mimic the workflow of an in-office clinic visit, complete with a waiting room, different examination rooms, and a common hub for providers. When audio-visual visits are not possible secondary to connectivity issues, then telephone calls without video are a backup option. Lastly, electronic communication (such as email or medical record messaging) can be used to maintain contact with patients but is suitable only for nonurgent needs of established patients. New changes allow for billing of these electronic communications (see Table 2 for a virtual visit billing guide).",

In addition, the MA obtains special consent for the telemedicine visit, which includes confirming the patient's location and that they are in the same state or a state that has waived licensing requirements during the pandemic, consenting the patient to participate in a telemedicine visit, directing the patient to call 911 or seek the nearest Emergency Department in the event of a medical emergency, and advising that the patient should plan to see the attending physician at least once for an office visit within the next year. Due to the novelty and potentially confusing nature of remote clinic visits, the MA is instrumental in informing the patient on what to expect. The patient is told to login or \u201ccheck-in\u201d at least 15 min prior to their appointment, to conduct the visit in a quiet room with good lighting, to wear clothes that are easily removed should a direct examination of the spine or an extremity be needed, and to have someone else available to hold the camera, if possible, to facilitate capturing physical examination findings. It is also important for the documenting physician to record the time of the encounter, as billing is done by time.",

            "text": "One major component of neurosurgical telemedicine visits that differs from general practice telemedicine is the importance of imaging for evaluating and diagnosing disease. Acquiring that imaging poses a unique challenge to neurosurgeons, particularly for new patients who have had imaging done at outside facilities. Traditionally, new patients are instructed to bring compact discs (CDs) to clinic to have them uploaded into the Emory system via LifeImage (Newton, Massachusetts). During the COVID-19 crisis, we have developed several workflows for acquiring outside imaging: (1) the outside imaging center can push images directly to our PACS via PowerShare (Burlington, Massachusetts), (2) the imaging center can upload images to LifeImage and then we transfer them to PACS, (3) the imaging center can give the patient a CD or USB of the images, which the patient can upload from their own computer to LifeImage, or (4) the patient can mail the CD or USB to clinic prior to their telemedicine appointment. We have created \u201cimaging teams\u201d with personnel that expedite image retrieval with the patient prior to their telemedicine visit. During the actual visit, Zoom's screenshare capability facilitates reviewing images with patients, and the ability to draw on the scan in real time allows for effective communication and patient education.",

Once the COVID-19 crisis is over, neurosurgeons will need to address this inevitable backlog: perhaps by decreasing clinic time (since we can theoretically see more clinic patients now) and increasing operative time. Regardless, scheduling patients for surgery without an in-office visit has interesting moral, legal, and ethical implications, which have largely never been thought of until this point.",
