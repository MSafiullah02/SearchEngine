This review lists the antibacterials, \u03b2-lactamase/\u03b2-lactam inhibitor (BLI) combinations, and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) first launched around the world since 2009 and details the seven new antibiotics and two new \u03b2-lactam/ BLI combinations launched since 2016. The development status, mode of action, spectra of activity, lead source, and administration route for the 44 small molecule antibacterials, eight \u03b2-lactamase/BLI combinations, and one antibody drug conjugate (ADC) being evaluated in worldwide clinical trials at the end of October 2019 are described. Compounds discontinued from clinical development since 2016 and new antibacterial pharmacophores are also reviewed. There has been an increase in the number of early stage clinical candidates, which has been fueled by antibiotic-focused funding agencies; however, there is still a significant gap in the pipeline for the development of new antibacterials with activity against \u03b2-metallolactamases, orally administered with broad spectrum G\u2212ve activity, and new treatments for MDR Acinetobacter and gonorrhea.",

            "text": "Since their development in the 1940s, antibacterial drugs have become lifesaving medicines that are integral to human health. Unfortunately, antibacterial drug resistance is widespread amongst pathogenic bacteria, which significantly reduces the medical effectiveness of currently marketed drugs. These drug-resistant and multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria have been acknowledged by Governments and scientists as one of the world's most pressing health issues; however, the discovery and development of new antibiotics and antibiotic-alternatives to treat these infections is not straightforward. As a consequence, it is important to analyze the antibacterial development pipeline to capture a snapshot of what is happening today and compare it to previous years. This review provides an update to previous reviews in this series in 2015 [1] , 2013 [2] and 2011 [3] , which are complementary to recent reviews that describe the pre-clinical [4] and clinical pipeline [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . There have also been several important reviews that analyze the lead discovery and development of antibiotics [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] , antibiotic alternatives [23] [24] [25] , \u03b2-lactam/ \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors [26, 27] , and antibiotic conjugate and prodrug strategies [28] . There has also been reviews that discuss issues with antibiotic stewardship, resistance and, the commercialization challenge [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] .",

The clinical trial codes, which are predominantly from ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT), are listed in parentheses for each antibacterial, BLI \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor, DBO diazabicyclooctane, mAb monoclonal antibody, NP natural product-derived, S synthetic, USA United States of America a The structures of the antibiotics approved from 2000 to 2014 can be found in our previous reviews [1] [2] [3] b First member of a new antibiotic or \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor class approved for human therapeutic use c Approved for topical use d First launches: tazobactam in 1992, ceftazidime in 1983, meropenem (13) in 1998, and imipenem (15) + cilastatin (16) in 1985 e Also approved for the treatment of amebiasis and trichomoniasis while non-registered trials are referenced at least by a Press Release or peer-reviewed publication. A list of online clinical trial databases can be found in the Supplementary information. Repurposed drugs that have not previously been approved as antibacterials have been included in this analysis. Pro-drugs are grouped together with their active metabolites, while ongoing trials of antibacterial drugs that already approved anywhere in the world are not discussed but are listed in Table S2 . Compounds for which no development activity has been reported since 2017 are listed in Table 6 . The antibacterials in clinical development have been further analyzed by phase and source derivation (Fig. 13) and to the previous 2011 [3] , 2013 [2] , and 2015 [1] (Table 7 , Figs. 15 and 16) and administration routes (Figs. S1 and S2) has also been undertaken.",

Of the 38 new antibacterials, five were first-in-class: linezolid (oxazolidinone, S, 2000), daptomycin (lipopeptide, NP, 2003), retapamulin (pleuromutilin, NP-derived, 2007), fidaxomicin (tiacumicin, NP, 2011) and bedaquiline (diarylquinoline, S, 2012).

In September 2019, Kyorin announced that an oral formulation of 10 (called KRP-AM1977X) has been approved for the treatment of CAP, otorhinolaryngological and respiratory tract infections [108] , while an NDA for the IV formulation (KRP-AM1977Y) is under preparation. Cefiderocol (11) (Fetroja, S-649266) is an IV administered, semi-synthetic cephalosporin-type \u03b2-lactam developed by Shionogi & Co., Ltd. (Osaka, Japan), which incorporates a catechol siderophore that facilitates active transport into the bacteria via iron transporters, that has activity against MDR G-ve pathogens including carbapenemase producers [109] [110] [111] [112] . Cefiderocol (11) is first approved antibacterial that exploits the iron transport uptake mechanism. Shionogi filed an NDA with the FDA in December 2018 for cUTI including pyelonephritis and an MAA with EMA in March 2019 multi-drug G-ve infections [113] . In November 2019, the FDA approved cefiderocol (11) for the treatment of cUTI [114] . Cefiderocol (11) has been evaluated in phase-III trials as a treatment for carbapenem-resistant G-ve pathogens at various sites (NCT02714595) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP)/ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)/healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) (NCT03032380). Positive results for a phase-II trial against cUTI (NCT02321800) has recently been published [115] .",

In April 2019, FUJIFILM Toyama applied for a NDA in Japan with the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) as a treatment bacterial infections in otorhinolaryngology (ear, nose and throat) [127] . Solithromycin (17) was discovered by Optimer Pharmaceuticals (San Diego, CA, USA) and was being developed in the USA by Cempra Pharmaceuticals (Chapel Hill, NC, USA). Cempra submitted an NDA for CABP to the FDA in May 2016 but the FDA sent a Complete Letter Response in December 2016 that requested additional clinical safety information and the satisfactory resolution of manufacturing facility inspection deficiencies [128] . Cempra withdrew the CABP MAA for the EMA in March 2017 [129] . Cempra merged in August 2017 with Melinta Therapeutics (New Haven, CT, USA), who are not currently developing solithromycin (17) ( Table 2 , Fig. 4 ).",

Iclaprim (18) was discovered by Roche (Basel, Switzerland; coded RO-48-2622) and licensed in 2001 to their anti-infectives spin-out Arpida AG (Reinach, Switzerland; coded AR-100). Arpida completed two phase-III trials evaluating 18 for SSSI but the FDA rejected their NDA in 2009, while their MAA was later withdrawn due to concerns about not reaching non-inferiority to its comparator antibiotic and potential QT interval prolongation issues [132] . Motif Bio started to develop iclaprim (18) in 2015 and submitted an NDA with the FDA in June 2018 for ABSSSI from data derived from two phase-III trials (NCT02600611 and NCT02607618) [133] with altered dosing regimens compared with Arpida's trials [131] ; however, the FDA required an additional clinical trial before granting approval [134] and Motif Bio have subsequentially halted development. Compounds in phase-III trials Sulopenem (19) (CP-70,429) is a synthetic thiopenem \u03b2-lactam discovered in Pfizer's Japanese laboratories that underwent clinical evaluation in the mid-1990s but development was discontinued due to high development costs and market return concerns [135] . Interestingly, the R enantiomer of sulopenem caused unpleasant sulfurous odors when dosed in human volunteers and the racemate CP65,207 could not be used [136] . Pfizer re-started clinical development in 2003 using a more efficient production-scale synthesis procedure to help alleviate the cost issue [137, 138] . In late 2015, Iterum Therapeutics plc (Dublin, Ireland) licensed sulopenem (19) and its prodrug sulopenem etzadroxil (20) (PF-03709270) from Pfizer [139] . Iterum are now evaluating 19 using IV administration followed by oral dosing of 20 in phase-III studies for the treatment of cIAI (NCT03358576) and cUTI Table 6 Compounds discontinued or likely to have been discontinued from clinical development since 2016 or previous review [1] Name (synonym)",

            "text": "Compound class (lead source); mode of action Last known status and indication In these trials, sulopenem etzadroxil (19) is administered along with probenecid (21) [140] , which is a marketed drug for gout and hyperuricemia that increases uric acid production, that inhibits the tubular secretion of some \u03b2-lactams and leads to a longer drug half-life and higher serum concentrations [141] (Table 3 , Figs. 6 and 7). Murepavadin (22) (POL7080, RG7929) is a synthetic cyclic peptide 14-mer based on protegrin I that is being developed by Polyphor, Ltd. (Basel, Switzerland) [142] [143] [144] . Murepavadin (22) has a new mode of action through binding to the N-terminal of the \u03b2-barrel protein LptD (Imp/OstA) from P. aeruginosa [142, 145] , which affects lipopolysaccharide transport to the cell surface and leads to bacterial death [146] . As this binding pocket is only present in P. aeruginosa LptD, murepavadin (22) displays selective anti-P. aeruginosa activity, which should help to reduce resistance and microbiome disturbance. Polyphor have been evaluating murepavadin (22) in two phase-III trials for the treatment of Pseudomonas nosocomial pneumonia (NCT03582007) and VAP infections (NCT03409679); however, it was announced in May 2019 that there was an increase in serum creatinine and acute kidney injury using IV administration in the nosocomial pneumonia trial [147] . In July 2019, Polyphor announced that this trial had been closed but stressed that the inhaled administration route was not impacted [148] . SQ 109 (23) is an ethambutol analog discovered at the NIAID (Bethesda, MD, USA) [149, 150] that was first developed by Sequella, Inc (Rockville, MD, USA), who later licensed the development for the Russian Federation and Commonwealth of Independent States to Infectex (Moscow, Russia). In March 2017, Infectex announced positive results from a phase-II/III trial for the treatment of MDR pulmonary TB [151, 152] , but since then there has been no update. Results from a Sequella-sponsored phase-II trial evaluating high range oral doses of rifampicin, moxifloxacin and SQ109 (23) for treating TB (NCT01785186) has been published [153] . Although SQ109 (23) is structurally derived from ethambutol, SQ109 (23) has different modes of action and activity against other bacteria and parasites. Ethambutol targets arabinofuranosyl transferases EmbA and EmbB [154, 155] , which are involved in cell wall synthesis, and was recently reported to show synergy with isoniazid targeting a transcriptional repressor of the inhA gene [156] and glutamate racemase (MurI) [157] . Conversely, SQ109 (23) has been reported to inhibit mMpl3, which is a trehalose monomycolate transporter important in cell wall synthesis [158] , as well as inhibit the quinone biosynthesis enzymes MenA and MenG and affect bacterial respiration and electron transfer [159, 160] .",

The nitro group present BTZs is reduced in vivo and the reactive nitroso intermediate forms a covalent semi-mercaptal adduct with cysteine-387 of Mycobacterium tuberculosis decaprenylphosphoryl-\u03b2-D-ribose (DPR) 2\u2032-oxidase (DprE1), which is an essential enzyme used to cell wall synthesis [269] [270] [271] . Macozinone (47) has activity against a range of Mycobacterium species but resistance can arise through amino acid polymorphism of cysteine-387 [271, 272] . It has been recently shown that macozinone (47) and BTZ043 (48) can be de-aromatized in vivo through formation of a Meisenheimer complex, which could also reduce their in vivo half-lives [273] .",

The mode of action of polymyxins involves membrane disruption but is complex [287] . SPR 741 (52) was initially developed by Northern Antibiotics (Helsinki, Finland) and designed to have less nephrotoxicity by reducing the number of positive charges [288] [289] [290] . The replacement of the 3-hydroxyoctanoate group with an acetate leads to a significant reduction in antibacterial activity, while maintaining Lipid A binding in a similar way to polymyxin nonapeptide; the combination of these effects leads to strong synergisms and enhanced G-ve activity of several antibacterials [290] [291] [292] [293] .",

In 2019, the number in phase-III/NDA (13) and phase-II (18) is similar to previous years, but the number in phase-I trials (22) in 2019 has increased from an average 12 compounds in the previous reviews [1] [2] [3] . Thirteen of the phase-I compounds target G\u2212ve bacteria (seven compounds including one antivirulence and five BLI combinations), while there are nine with G+ve activity (including five against TB and one for CDI). It will be interesting to monitor how many of the current phase-I antibacterials move to phase-II studies and beyond in the next few years and whether this higher number of antibacterials in phase-I level will be maintained or even increased.",

In the TB field, there is also an emerging mode of action around the mycobacterial respiratory system, which is inhibited by bedaquiline (launched 2012) and the clinical candidate telacebec (46) [378] . Recent work has also shown that inhibition of the respiratory system in other bacteria is an important factor in bacteria cell death [379] . The \"macro\" mode of action classes (e.g., cell wall inhibitors) are further divided into structure classes (e.g., \u03b2-lactam), which and sometimes further into structure subclasses (e.g., penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems, and monobactams). A pharmacophore is the common sub-unit of active molecules that interacts with the biological target (e.g., the \u03b2-lactam subunit of the \u03b2-lactam antibacterials).",

The second highest category is iv administration with 17, while there are six candidates that use iv/po; the iv/po switch strategy is used when patients move from iv administration in intensive care to oral afterwards. Eight of the 15 iv administered drugs are derived from NP lead, which is not unexpected due their physico-chemical properties [21, 380] . The po topical (5) administration route is used to treat for gastrointestinal infections, such as C. difficile and H. pylori. For po topical, the clinical candidates are taken orally as tablets, but are not significantly systemically absorbed; this contrasts with po administered compounds that are taken orally but pass through the gut and into blood for delivery throughout the body. Interestingly, one of the CDI clinical candidates, DNV-3837 (44) is being developed using iv administration, which differentiates it to the other five CDI clinical candidates in development and marketed drugs that use the po topical route.
