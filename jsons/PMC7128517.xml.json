Influenza is one of the most frequently identified respiratory viruses in travellers,1 and the high density of people at mass events further increases the risk of transmission. Despite this, the epidemiology of influenza outbreaks in large congregations is poorly understood. Variability of venues and the infrequency of mass events may have been barriers for systematic study of communicable diseases in these situations. However, because the venue does not change and the event occurs every year, the Islamic Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, does provide an excellent opportunity to research infectious diseases that not only affect a mass event but also have the potential for pandemic spread.",

Genomic sequencing showed that the viruses from both patients were essentially homologous.

Three studies from Pakistan, Malaysia, and Iran have so far assessed the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccine against influenza-like illness among Hajj pilgrims. The Pakistani and Malaysian studies reported the vaccine to be effective; however, the Iranian study, which was done over two consecutive influenza seasons, reported that the vaccine was effective during the 2003 Hajj but not during the 2004 Hajj.12, 13, 14 Virological surveillance reports suggest that the rate of influenza in vaccinated pilgrims might not significantly differ from that in unvaccinated pilgrims.5, 6\n",
