Vectors for diseases such as malaria, dengue, chikungunya, and Zika thrive in wet, tropical climates. Countries closer to the equator tend to be poorer, producing living conditions\u2014pools of standing water, open windows and fans rather than air conditioning\u2014that facilitate mosquito reproduction and infection of humans (Gallup & Sachs, 2001). Lower levels of education in society mean fewer medical personnel and public health workers available to fight disease (Frenk et al., 2010). State capacity tends to be more limited as well, complicating efforts to mount large-scale public education campaigns or carry out household-level mosquito control efforts (Burkle, 2006).",

The difficulties are often compounded when multiple levels of government are involved. Making funds available to local authorities for the purpose of fighting disease can potentially improve eradication efforts, since municipal officials tend to have better knowledge of their communities and may be more trusted by the population. Yet their political incentives may lead them to focus scarce resources on other priorities, such as infrastructure investment, that carry better expected electoral returns.",

Our study takes place in the state of Pernambuco, Brazil\u2014the epicenter of the 2015\u201316 outbreak of congenital Zika syndrome, or the series of birth defects associated with the Zika virus. We conducted a face-to-face survey experiment in July 2016, informing the treatment group about the mayor\u2019s use of federal funds to hire public health workers for the purpose of controlling mosquito-borne illnesses. We examine the effect of this information on intended vote for the mayor\u2019s reelection, measured via a secret ballot simulation at the end of the survey.",

Yet we do find a large and significant punishment effect among a subgroup for whom information about mosquito control should be particularly salient: those who personally know someone affected by microcephaly or the Zika virus. Drawing on our survey as well as focus groups, we argue that most voters fail to act upon our treatment information because they primarily associate mosquito control with dengue, an endemic disease that has existed in Brazil for decades and is much more prevalent than Zika. Inducing behavioral changes in response to endemic diseases is much more difficult than in the case of epidemics because people have a tendency to discounts risks that are familiar and well-understood. While international media coverage focused extensively on the Zika epidemic, both citizens and politicians in Pernambuco are much more concerned with the quality of basic health services, such as the staffing of local medical centers.",

Prior experimental studies of health service provision, primarily in the field of economics, have focused on the inherent principal-agent problem in this relationship. Assuming that poor health indicators or service delivery statistics are primarily attributable to a lack of effort on the part of frontline providers, these studies have examined whether different forms of recruitment attract better health workers or whether performance incentives and monitoring can improve service provision for a given set of employees (Ashraf et al., 2014, Ashraf et al., 2014, Ashraf et al., 2016, Banerjee et al., 2008, Basinga et al., 2011, Callen et al., 2018, Deserranno, 2017, Dhaliwal and Hanna, 2017, Gertler and Vermeersch, 2012, Mignozzetti, 2018, Miller et al., 2012). Such studies implicitly or explicitly assume that principals desire better health service provision. In a review of the literature, Finan, Olken, and Pande (2017, 492) argue that in the case of \u201cfrontline government service providers,\u201d including health workers, \u201cthe government and the citizen\u2019s incentives are aligned: both would like the agent\u2026to provide more or better services\u201d.",

Managing health programs may consume scarce resources that elected officials would prefer to spend in high-visibility areas with more potential for credit claiming, such as infrastructure investment.

Conclusions from this research program have been mixed; one study shows that efforts to facilitate citizen monitoring improve service delivery and health outcomes (Bj\u00f6rkman and Svensson, 2009, Bj\u00f6rkman Nyqvist et al., 2017), whereas other studies in the area of education have found null effects on citizen engagement, learning outcomes, and teacher effort (Banerjee et al., 2010, Lieberman et al., 2014). A general conclusion is that the effective exercise of social accountability is often inhibited by barriers to collective action, a low sense of efficacy, and a lack of knowledge of concrete steps that citizens can take to act upon information (Banerjee et al., 2010, Buntaine et al., 2018, Fox, 2015, Lieberman et al., 2014).\n1\n",

Fox (2015) thus issues a call to scholars to \u201cbring vertical accountability back in\u201d to the study of social accountability in the developing world.

In Mexico, Chong, de la O, Karlan, and Wantchekon (2015) show that information about corruption lowered support for incumbent parties but also for challengers. In a Brazilian mayoral election, De Figueiredo, Hidalgo, and Kasahara (2011) show that informing about corruption charges reduced vote share only for the challenger, not for the incumbent. In Uganda, Humphreys and Weinstein (2012) argue that information dissemination has little effect on incumbent vote share at all. Most recently, six separate studies in Africa and Latin America, informing about aspects of performance from public goods provision to charges of malfeasance, show that information provision almost always has null effects on voting for the incumbent (Dunning, Grossman, Humphreys, Hyde, McIntosh, & Nellis, inpress)\u201d.",

There are few vaccination options for illnesses such as dengue, chikungunya, and Zika, and their most common host, the Aedes aegypti mosquito, is resistant to fumigation efforts because it typically lives indoors where airborne insecticides do not penetrate (Gubler, 1989). Hence, the most effective way to fight these diseases is to prevent their insect hosts from reproducing or infecting new individuals.

Dengue has been endemic in Pernambuco for at least two decades, and there have been major outbreaks in 2002 and 2015, along with more limited spikes in a number of years. Chikungunya began spreading widely in 2016, approaching the incidence of dengue in that year. In 2015, there were more than 96 times as many confirmed cases of dengue as suspected cases of congenital Zika syndrome. In 2016, the ratio was 60 to 1 for dengue and 45 to 1 for chikungunya.",

Given this profile, studies of dengue in Brazil have reached similar conclusions as those from other countries with respect to subjective risk perception and preventive behavior. In the town of Santo Agostinho in Pernambuco, a study concluded that the public was well-informed about dengue but took insufficient measures to protect themselves from infection (Santos, dos Santos Pereira Cabral, & da Silva Augusto, 2011). Another study in the southern state of Mato Grosso do Sul reached similar conclusions, emphasizing the difficulty of maintaining preventive behavior after outbreaks have subsided (Reis, Andrade, & Ven\u00e2ncio da Cunha, 2013).",
