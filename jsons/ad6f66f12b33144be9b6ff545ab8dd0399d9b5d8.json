Immediately after death, observations were made visually in situ and by radiography. Further observations were made in a museum laboratory setting, prior to and following clearing of soft tissues. Selected dry bone specimens were evaluated using computed tomography. Significant cartilage erosion and osteoarthropathy were identified in all shoulder joints. No single evaluation method yielded maximal information. Plain film radiography revealed only more severe changes. Computed tomography yielded more detail and clarity than standard radiography. Direct examination of articular cartilage informed about joint soft tissue, and dry bone informed about externally visible bone pathology. These data provide a basis for biological, biomedical, ecological, and archaeological scientists to improve retrospective interpretations of bone lesions. They further support developing plausible differential diagnoses for features of ancient and modern animal bones. We noted a dog-like capacity for wolf longevity in a non-free-roaming environment. However, aged wolves' life spans far exceeded those of similar-sized domestic dogs and breeds, suggesting the possibility of an important species difference that should be explored. We suggest also a hypothesis that the driving force for joint pathology in sheltered non-domestic species may relate significantly to achieving the longevity that is possible biologically, but is uncommon in the wild because of differential stochastic influences.

However, there is little indication that degenerative joint disease is a direct outcome of a long-term sheltered ecology for wild animals. This should not be surprising, since degenerative joint disease is known to be nonspecific, with many possible contributing factors (Pedersen et al., 2000) .",

The IGF-1 gene of domestic dogs was found to explain 50% of population variation in breed size (Sutter et al., 2007) , which with our observations, supports considering new research in comparative quantitative trait inheritance among canids.

Thus, in the canine shoulder, the scapular glenoid, and articular proximal humerus, are not in constant full point-to-point contact. Korvick and Athanasiou (1997) evaluated scapular and humeral articulations from seven normal dogs, observing that cartilage damage does not occur in adult dogs as the result of differential mechanical properties between scapular and humeral cartilage.
