            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) was first described in 1978 by de Bouck and Pensaert as the etiologic agent of an enteric disease of swine termed \u201cepidemic viral diarrhea\u201d that had been recognized in early 1970\u2019s in Europe. Since then, porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), as the disease is now called, has been reported throughout Europe and Asia, and more recently the United States, Canada, and Mexico (Hoang et al., 2013; Marthaler et al., 2013; Mole, 2013; Ojkic et al., 2015; Stevenson et al., 2013). PED is characterized by severe watery diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration, resulting in 100 % morbidity and 80\u2013100 % mortality in suckling piglets, and a tremendous economic burden to the swine industry (Chasey and Cartwright, 1978; Debouck and Pensaert, 1980; Pensaert and de Bouck, 1978; Singh, 1999; Sueyoshi et al., 1995). Outbreaks of PED in China were sporadic (Chen et al., 2010) until late 2010, when PED broke out in South China, and subsequently spread throughout the country inflicting a huge blow to the Chinese pig industry(Ge et al., 2013; Sun et al., 2012). Numerous studies have revealed that new variant strains of PEDV were the primary pathogens in these outbreaks (Chen et al., 2012; Hoang et al., 2013; Li et al., 2012a, b; Marthaler et al., 2013).",

            "text": "PEDV is an enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the genus Alphacoronavirus in the Coronaviridae family. The PEDV genome is approximately 28 kb in length (Chen et al., 2010), consisting of 5\u02b9- and 3\u02b9- untranslated region (UTR), and seven open reading frames (ORFs) encoding polyproteins 1a and 1b (PP1a and PP1b), spike (S), ORF3, envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins (Song and Park, 2012). The S protein is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein containing two functional subunits, S1 and S2, which are responsible for viral binding and fusion respectively. The S protein also plays a role in the induction of neutralizing antibodies, and the virus adaptability in cells (Bosch et al., 2003; Park et al., 2007). Genome comparisons between the prototype strain CV777 and PEDV variants showed that the differences were mainly concentrated in the S1 subunit which is important for studying the genetic relationships among different PEDV strains and for epidemiological investigations (Lin et al., 2017).The N protein is a highly conserved phosphoprotein, only a few point mutations have been reported to date. It has multiple functions in viral replication, assembly, and pathogenesis, for example, it can block nuclear factor-\u03baB nuclear translocation, antagonizing interferon-\u03bb production (Shan et al., 2018) and may also be a promising target for vaccine development research due to its antigenicity.",

G1 and G2 can be further divided into G1a, G1b, and G2a, G2b, respectively. The G2 group comprises the post-2010 global epidemic isolates including mutations mainly in the N terminal domain of S1 (S1-NTD) (Fan et al., 2017). These mutations affect the conformational structure and N-linked glycosylation of S1-NTD, which may alter the pathogenicity of the variants (Chen et al., 2019).

PED outbreaks have subsequently been reported in Korea, Thailand, and North America, resulting in an increasingly serious threat to the swine industry worldwide. At present, most of the prevalent strains in China are highly pathogenic variants (Lin et al., 2016). While there are many commercially available PEDV vaccines, they are based on the classical strains CV777, SM98, and DR13, and vaccinated pigs are not well protected from the Chinese highly pathogenic variants infection, regardless of the inoculum strain or type (activated/killed or attenuated) (Wang et al., 2016a, b; Ayudhya et al., 2012). The differences in genetic component between the current epidemic strains and commercial vaccine strains may be the main reason for this lack of immune protection. Because of the genetic and antigenic diversity of PED isolates, it is necessary to monitor emerging epidemic strains with genomic surveillance programs (Sun et al., 2019). From a molecular epidemiological survey of PEDV done in our lab in 2016, we found a PEDV strain, from one clinical sample of small intestine, that had a specific continuous 36-nt deletion in the N gene. This PEDV strain, originated from a farm in Shanghai, is named PEDV SH. After virus isolation, PEDV SH was plaque purified three times then grown out over 5 generations in Vero cells. The N gene sequence of the purified isolate, after 5 generations, was the same as the parent virus originally isolated from the intestinal tissue. We then commenced characterizing the full genome, pathogenicity, and immunogenicity of the 5th generation of this new strain.",

All piglets challenged with SH presented typical symptoms of diarrhea, vomiting, weight loss, and ultimately death at 3- and 4-d.p.i., demonstrating that PEDV SH was highly pathogenic to suckling piglets. To study the effect of the gene deletion on the immunogenicity of PEDV SH, the sera from the mice inoculated with PEDV SH were detected by ELISA.

These results remind us that the NEP-1C9 polypeptide may act as a candidate antigen in differential diagnosis assays to distinguish not only the circulating antibodies to PEDV from that to TGEV, but also the conventional strains of PEDV from SH strain. Of course, to fully understand the effect of the NEP-1C9 deletion, the N gene from SH should be cloned to study its expression, localization, and stability. Additionally, the effect of the NEP-1C9 deletion on viral virulence could be tested by constructing infectious cDNA.",

Previous reports have shown that PEDV N of the cell-adapted G1 strain is likely to be cleaved by 3C-like protease during replication, leaving only the first 380 amino acids after cleavage (Jaru-Ampornpan et al., 2017). This cleavage motif is present in the majority of cell culture-adapted PEDV strains but absent in the emerging field isolates. This protein cleavage is possibly a marker of PEDV adaptation to cell culture. The C-terminal region of the N protein may not be essential for virus replication. Because the PEDV 3Cpro cleavage site is at residue 382 which is in front of the deleted NEP-1C9 epitope, we deduced that the deletion might have no effect on virus replication in vitro. In addition to the unique deletion found in N protein, we noted some amino acid substitutions in N protein of SH strain also occurred in most wild PEDV. These amino acid substitutions may compensate for the deletion of NEP-1C9 to facilitate virus replication, which needs further study using infectious cDNA techniques.",

The S protein of the PEDV SH isolate has characteristics shared by all emerging strains, and similar mutations to the Korean strains, in which the base insertions and deletions were firstly found, compared with CV777 (Lee et al., 2010). The multiple point mutations at the N-terminal of the PEDV SH S gene result in a decrease in the number of N-glycosylation sites and positional changes, compared with CV777, but the effect of them on the function of the S protein has not been clarified. It has been reported that a 5 % amino acid difference in the S1 protein of infectious bronchitis virus led to poor cross-immune protection (Cavanagh, 2003). Based on the S gene, PEDV strains are divided into three genotypes: G1 (classical strains), G2 (variant strains) and S-INDEL (recombinant strains). At present, the most prevalent PEDV strains worldwide, especially in China, belong to G2 strains (Lin et al., 2016). G2 strains are further divided into 2 subgroups: G2a mainly occurrs in Asia, while G2b is primarily endemic to Asia and North America (Sun et al., 2019). Liu et al. (2019) reported that G2a strain-based inactivated vaccine candidates were more promising than G2b-based candidates for the development of an effective vaccine against the current highly virulent pandemic PEDV strains. Phylogenetic analysis shows that the SH strain belongs to group G2b, as do the other field isolates in China (Chen et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019). SH strain has a closer phylogenetic relationship with strains isolated from southern China in 2011\u20132012, than with other Chinese strains, which share a closer phylogenetic relationship with Asian strains than with U.S. strains. We also note that the S gene of the SH isolate has three asparagine substitutions, (N57SS\u2192NST, N341LS\u2192NFS, and N723NT\u2192NST), two insertions (N118AT and N1196HT), and three deletions (N 127KT, N230CT and N1006IT).
