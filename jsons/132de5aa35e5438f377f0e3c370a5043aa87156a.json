The recruitment-to-inflation (R/I) ratio (i.e. the ratio between the recruited lung compliance and C RS at PEEP 5 cmH 2 O) was used to assess lung recruitability. A R/I ratio value higher than or equal to 0.5 was used to define highly recruitable patients.",

However, information about specific individual characteristics of respiratory mechanics of SARS-Cov-2-associated ARDS remains very limited [4] [5] [6] . Based on their experience during the crisis, some authors suggested that part of the SARS-Cov-2 associated ARDS may present relatively high respiratory system compliance (C RS ) and poor recruitability with PEEP, contrasting with severe hypoxemia. Accordingly, high levels of PEEP might be harmful in this socalled \"phenotype\". The aim of this prospective study is to describe the characteristics of the respiratory mechanics of SARS-Cov-2-associated ARDS, and, in particular, whether the lungs are recruitable with high levels of PEEP.",

[16] . Our observations extend those initially reported in three small cases series showing essentially low or variable potentials of recruitment with PEEP [4] [5] [6] . In the recently reported Chinese series of 12 SARS-Cov-2-associated ARDS, all patients were initially considered as poorly recruitable based on the same method to measure R/I ratio [4] . Interestingly, repetitive measurements showed that some of them became recruitable potentially depending on the time course evolution of the disease and the respiratory treatment they received (notably prone positioning). Authors concluded that R/I ratio is feasible, even in the constrained Covid-19 environment and may allow to guide individual titration of PEEP to limit potential harmful effects expected with high PEEP in poorly recruitable patients. Most (75%) of these patients received NIV or HFNC before intubation for a median of 5 [IQR, [4] [5] [6] [7] days. This could lead to patient self-inflicted lung injury [17] that may explain, at least in part, their low respiratory system compliance (around 20 mL/cmH 2 O) after intubation. This may also have participated to the apparent beneficial effect of prone position on recruitment in this series despite initial poor recruitability.",

Based on these original observations, authors challenged the classical recommendations for PEEP titration and prone positioning based on the severity of hypoxemia [19] , suggesting that PEEP may lead to severe hemodynamic impairment and fluid retention in poorly recruitable patients while prone position may be less efficient imposing an unnecessary additional workload in the context of the pandemic. The same group of authors proposed a concise physiological description of what they called \"phenotypes L and H\". Briefly they opposed the possible high proportion of poorly recruitable patients with near-normal compliance (\"L\") to patients with low compliance and high potential for recruitment (\"H\" not different from classical non-Covid-19 ARDS) that may benefit from higher PEEP and prone position. Authors mentioned that the phenotype may change with time.",

In fact, PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio was significantly increased at PEEP 15 cmH 2 O compared to 5 cmH 2 O only in highly recruitable patients. Conversely, poorly recruitable patients exhibited a non-significant trend toward higher C RS at low PEEP compared to highly recruitable patients. Moreover, the trend in decrease in C RS observed in these patients when PEEP is increased may reflect overinflation thus indicating the risk associated with high PEEP in these patients. Of note, the increase in PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio with PEEP in poorly recruitable patients may be explained, at least in part, by a potential reduction in cardiac output induced by PEEP that may have contributed to decrease the shunt fraction [13] . Rather than the schematic opposition of two phenotypes, our results suggest that recruitment with PEEP in these patients must be individually evaluated since it may vary largely depending on the initial clinical presentation as well as the time course evolution under treatment.",

First of all, the small number of patients enrolled in this series does not allow to conclude about the expected repartition of the two proposed phenotypes in a large population of SARS-Cov-2-associated ARDS. Moreover, initial respiratory management (i.e. prolonged use of HFNC, CPAP or non-invasive ventilation vs early intubation) is a confoundable parameter that may impact the respiratory pattern recorded immediately after intubation. Second, the respiratory mechanics characterization at two levels of PEEP and the R/I ratio do definitively not allow to determine accurately the optimal PEEP level. Finally, the second respiratory mechanics evaluation was not available in all patients thus limiting the possibility to assess the impact of prone positioning and PEEP settings that may change the evolution of the phenotype along the time course evolution of the disease.",

After a 10 min period with PEEP 5 cmH 2 O, arterial and central venous blood gases were collected and respiratory mechanics was assessed. A low flow insufflation (5L/min) from PEEP 5 cmH 2 O was performed after a prolonged expiration.
