            "text": "The current Coronavirus crisis emerged from the propagation of the SARS-CoV-2, a novel virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019). Its origin is linked to a large sea food and live animal market in Wuhan, China, suggesting animal-to-person spread. However, the rapid contagion and many patients reporting no exposure to animal markets, indicates an ongoing person-to-person transmission. The situation triggered an outbreak of the virus beyond China, severely affecting countries such as Italy, Spain, Germany, France, Iran, the U.K., Switzerland, South Korea, Brazil, and the U.S. (i.e., a global pandemic). The International Monetary Fund (IMF, 2020) has indicated that the world entered a crisis equal to or worse than the [2008] [2009] financial crisis. Hence, the nature of the Coronavirus crisis is affecting B2B firms, particularly their marketing and sales operations. The objective of this paper is to investigate the difference between the current Coronavirus crisis and prior \"traditional\" financial crises and to provide actionable recommendations based on the specificities of the current situation.",

Moreover, marketing literature has focused on financial-based crises (e.g., 1997 (e.g., -1998 Grewal & Tansuhaj, 2001) , building over the tenets of business cycle theory (see Dekimpe & Deleersnyder, 2018) . In this sense, the scarce literature on health-based crisis indicates that the role of human agents internal and external to the firm is key in dealing with this abrupt, sensitive event (Powell, Mustafee, & Brown, 2018; Day, McKay, Ishman, & Chung, 2004) . Therefore, we adopt social exchange theory (SET; Cropanzano & Mitchell, 2005; Homans, 1958; Lambe, Wittmann, & Spekman, 2001) as the conceptual lens for our study to answer: How do we manage B2B firms in order to satisfactorily navigate the Coronavirus crisis? SET allows a more J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof comprehensive understanding than economic theory, especially when investigating human attitudes and behaviors during periods of crisis to foster coping and resilience (Garner, 2017) .",

We investigated the current business context of B2B firms as experienced by practitioners and evoked their theories-in-use (TIU) about the human and social practices that help firms to navigate and recover from the complex current situation (see Chase & Murtha, 2019 ; Mora Cortez & Johnston, 2019; Ulaga & Reinartz, 2011;  for prior successful applications of TIU).",

            "text": "This study makes five primary contributions to managers. First, it differentiates the Coronavirus crisis from prior financial crises such as the 1997 -1998 Asian and 2008 subprime crises. The humanitarian breakdown caused by the Coronavirus pandemic posits the human being (e.g., employee, top manager, supplier manager, customer manager) at the center of the analysis. Practitioners state that everything starts with protecting and understanding people and, as a consequence, the business. Second, the adopted lockdown evidenced the weakness regarding the digital transformation of B2B firms. Practitioners identify not only a series of challenges to work from home, but also opportunities in data analytics, e-commerce, and social media. Third, the decision-making processes adopted new perspectives; for example, proactive strategic flexibility, which places emphasis on enabling effective management under environmental change. Such proactivity is reached by delegating non-critical decisions to middle managers and front-line employees. Fourth, leadership is motivated to drive social exchange. For J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f instance, this means coordinating functions and hierarchies to operate under clear constraints that foster agility in the interaction with internal and external ties. Fifth, emotions and stress management involves specific practices due to people struggling in this unprecedented global crisis. For example, managers are experiencing limitations in some social identities (e.g., tennis player, shopper, pub attendee, adventurer) due to government restrictions, while merging others (e.g., mother, manager, wife) in a single physical space.",

From a business perspective, crises are volatile times where endogenous and exogenous information and coordination in a system play relevant roles for organizations and people (Angeletos & Werning, 2006) . Organizational crises are related to different contexts, including natural disasters (such as hurricanes and earthquakes), health epidemics (such as Ebola in part of Africa in 2014-2015), technological disasters (such as the Y2K computer bug; Grewal & Tansuhaj, 2001 ), firm and government-level crises (such as union strikes), and financial crises (such as the 2008-2009 subprime crisis).

Social exchange involves actions that are contingent on rewarding reactions from others (Blau, 1964) . Simply put, social costs and rewards drive human decisions and behavior. Therefore, SET stresses the interdependent status between people in a relationship (Lee & Cadogan, 2009 ). The basic assumption of SET is that individuals enter into and maintain a relationship with the expectation to obtain a net positive value (i.e., rewards > costs; see the value concept in B2B relationships; e.g., Walter, Ritter, & Gem\u00fcnden, 2001; Eggert, Ulaga, & Schultz, 2006) from it (Lambe et al., 2001; Homans, 1958) . More recent studies have generalized the social exchange approach from individuals into exchanges between entities, firms, and/or groups (e.g., Cropanzano & Mitchell, 2005; Lee & Cadogan, 2009 ).",

            "text": "The exchange outcomes are critical for a comprehensive understanding of SET. While economic rewards such as money (e.g., price discount) are relevant, social rewards (e.g., emotional satisfaction and sharing ideals) are at least equally important (Lambe et al., 2001) . Additional attitudinal and behavioral elements highlighted in the social exchange literature are a sense of fairness (Molm, Collet, & Schaefer, 2006) , negotiated rules (Cropanzano & Mitchell, 2005) , and reciprocal actions (Molm, 2010) . Hence, the foundational premises and other elements of SET configure an adequate theoretical background for developing practices to navigate abrupt organizational crisis (Garner, 2017; Preikschas, Cabanelas, & R\u00fcdiger, 2014) . J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof Particularly, abrupt crises (e.g., global pandemics) can be managed from a perspective of ties rooted in SET (Blau, 1964) . Ties are connections between social nodes to control, develop and transfer resources for mutual benefits (Granovetter, 1973) . Ties, both within and across organizations, are sustained via the quality and quantity of contacts (Hossain, Murshed, & Uddin, 2013) . Through social ties, interdependence and reciprocity are cultivated by the process of exchanging resources (Garner, 2017) . Buyers and sellers in established relationships, with net positive social value at the crisis irruption, show higher levels of desire to adjust to changing environmental demands (Young-Ybarra & Wiersema, 1999) . However, a crisis can expose mistaken beliefs about the strength of the buyer-seller relationship (Krause & Ellram, 2014 ). An initial net negative social value decreases the expectations of the parties, and then, the crisis can be seen as an opportunity to reverse the situation through rethinking and updating the relational norms and perceived inter-organizational justice (Matopoulos, Didonet, Tsanasidis, & Ferne, 2019) . During a global pandemic, business is focalized on people's capacity to perform assigned tasks with internal and external partners (Myer, Conte, & Peterson, 2007; Powell et al., 2018) . If a relational imbalance occurs due to the crisis situation, it generates enough distress or guilt that partners often attempt to regain balance (Cropanzano & Mitchell, 2005; Garner, 2017) . Since abrupt crises often require \"new and untested behavior under time constraints, the ability of organizations to assemble the necessary resources immediately is critical. When the pattern of ties and the need of coordination overlap, greater resources can be made available\" (Hwang & Lichtenthal, 2000, p. 135) .",

Eventually, the pandemic's sense of urgency will make many of these communication ties reciprocal (Hensmans, 2015) . In addition, Starbuck, Greve, and Hedberg (1978) , describing solutions for major crises, indicate the need for increased joint communication across units within organizations that previously were unconnected. Similarly, Preikschas, Cabanelas, and R\u00fcdiger (2014) argue that fighting against a crisis by combining the resources of different companies in industrial relationships enables partners to achieve goals that could not otherwise be achieved alone, making possible value cocreation via reciprocal and mutually beneficial ties (Komulainen, 2014; Payne, Storbacka, & Frow, 2008) . Moreover, Krause and Ellram (2014) show the importance of relational (physical, human, and social) investments in interdependent B2B relationships, and also that expectations of reciprocity during a crisis moderate the association between interdependence and relational investments. In this vein, Matopoulos et al. (2019) indicate that crisis severity positively moderates the association between perceived inter-organizational justice and a supplier's financial performance, but the same is not true at very high levels of crisis severity. Profound, aggressive crises (e.g., the abrupt Coronavirus pandemic) require increased collaborative ties and the establishment of integrative mechanisms between organizations (Hwang & Lichtenthal, 2000) .",

We determined that a grounded theory approach using TIU to examine the Coronavirus crisis from a B2B perspective was appropriate for three main reasons. First, such an approach allows the researchers to be active in understanding and extending what they obtain from study participants. Second, marketing literature on managing crisis is scant (cf. Dekimpe & Deleersnyder, 2018) . Third, it permits researchers to grasp real-time observations of a phenomenon that is currently happening (Chase & Murtha, 2019) .",

The mere limitation in having social exchange is affecting individuals' mental health. Some interviewees suggested that scheduling 5to 10-minute breaks every hour of work (to talk about sports/music/traveling) is healthy for the group and the individual. They also indicated that encouraging social identities allows managers to be willing to create new ties both within and across firms, which have social value potential.",

Interviewees stated that having conversations online either with customers, suppliers, or colleagues is less effective than face-toface communication. The concentration of communication via online platforms makes it harder for individuals to grasp meaning from facial expressions, vocal tones, and other nonverbal communication hints, which increases cognitive tiredness and, consequently, generates negative attitudes toward the current scenario. When discussing sensitive topics and making important decisions, managers recognize that they are used to being physically present. For instance, many interviewees noted the relevance of the symbolic action of shaking hands when reaching an J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f agreement. In addition, the lockdown increases the perception of lack of choice, fostering negative attitudes toward work. A key tenet of SET to manage the described issues is rewards.",

Interviewees know that the market conditions are equally bad for all firms. Thus, being fired in this moment is highly harmful. Practitioners' preoccupation increases the levels of anxiety and uncertainty. For example, anxiety can be triggered by situations where a tie from before the crisis is no longer present. Communication and transparency to reassure employees are key to regain focus and increase job satisfaction. Hence, employees can reciprocate with the organization by doing their jobs the best they can. Interviewees noted that corporate and personal messages, indicating that the firm is making maximum efforts to keep all the staff during the crisis, are beneficial to reduce tension. Also, if the scenario would involve laying off some people, the organization should provide key dates regarding such decisions. The messages from corporate to employees need to show honest concern by practitioners as human beings, because they are going to be able to reciprocate proportionally to the perceived effort.",

Despite the fact that many interviewees acknowledged the relative precariousness of the digital transformation in their companies, we identified eight interesting practices that can contribute to surviving the current Coronavirus crisis in the best way.First, implementing digital showrooms for products and services. Interviewees indicated that commonly the sales efforts rely on face-to-face interactions with supportive physical or digital material. Offering customers the chance to have a completely simulated usage experience of the product or service execution allows buyers to pay attention to key offering attributes, preventing customers from just focusing on transactional elements such as delivery time, billing, or terms of payment, where fewer chances to differentiating exist. These digital showrooms enable buyer-seller communication and facilitate the creation of new ties through questions and answers in the platform. Such initial interactions then can be moved to telephone, email or other forms of pseudo-personal communication to keep cultivating the social exchange.",
