            "text": "It is estimated that 65 % of fatalities in Old World camels (OWC, i.e., Camelus dromedarius and C. bactrianus) and 50 % in New World camelids/South American camelids (NWC/SAC, i.e., the domestic alpaca (Vicugna pacos) and llama (Lama glama)) are caused by infectious diseases (Wernery and Kaaden 2002) . In the past, camels were used mainly for transportation beside their role as the main source of milk and meat for pastoralists. Dromedary camel in sub-Saharan Africa was traditionally known to be reared in the arid and semiarid lands. Due to aridity and desertification, they obliged to move to the higher rainfall areas side by side with other domestic livestock and wildlife. This change resulted in exposure of camels to diseases that were uncommon in their natural habitat such as dermatophilosis, tick paralysis, trypanosomosis, and brucellosis. The situation in Niger, Chad, and Sudan is an example where diseases like contagious ecthyma, trypanosomosis, and tick paralysis have become very serious with increased mortality rates due to the migration of camels south of their well-known camel belt. Drought in the Sahel and the Horn of Africa has also brought pastoralists closer to urban centers, and sales of camel milk became their main source of cash income. Due to an increased demand of urban populations of many countries, particularly in North Africa and the Middle East for camel milk, many dairy farms are established in intensive and semiintensive systems. This development may be responsible for making camels more susceptible to certain disease. Brucellosis, enterotoxemia, and Johne's disease are examples of these diseases. A similar situation could be envisaged for an increased incidence of enterotoxemia in camels when raised in an intensive husbandry system as in the UAE (Wernery and Kaaden 2002) or Syria (Khalafalla AI 2015, personnel communication) . Changes in animal husbandry related to increasing camel contacts with other animal species, such as equids, may cause disease emergence. Examples of newly emerged diseases of camels resulting from sharing premises with equines are glanders , melioidosis (Wernery et al. 1997) , and Rhodococcus equi infection . Another factor that may contribute to the emergence of camel diseases is the migration into new habitat that never was reached before by camels (Faye and Vias 2010) .",

A special research interest in camelpox has resulted in numerous publications on different aspects of the disease and the causative virus. This is mainly attributable to the resemblance of the CMLV to small poxvirus (Baxby 1974) .

According to Baxby (1972) , CMLV is different from the VARV, the causative agent of smallpox, and is incapable of infecting man. Kritz in Somalia (Kritz 1982) described the first report of a case of human camelpox. The case was a 40-year-old camel herder who developed lesions resembling those of smallpox in June 1978. From the 1970s until recently, it has been well accepted that CMLV rarely infects humans (Duraffour et al. 2011) . This is probably due to the crossimmunity induced via smallpox vaccination that ended in the late 1970s. It was therefore postulated that human camelpox may become more common as the immunity of the human population wanes (Duraffour et al. 2011) . Human population more than three decades after cessation of the smallpox vaccination has lost protection against that deadly virus and all zoonotic infections caused by human and animal OPVs as well. The first conclusive evidence of zoonotic CMLV infection in humans, associated with outbreaks in dromedary camels, has been recently reported in India where three human cases of camelpox have been reported (Bera et al. 2011 ). They were detected in animal handlers during an outbreak of camelpox, and the lesions were confined to the hands and fingers of camel handlers and passed through all the stages of pox lesions until the formation of scabs. These are the first confirmed cases of zoonotic camelpox as infection was diagnosed by conventional PCR and seroconversion. Additional four cases of camelpox in humans ( ",

            "text": "Rift Valley fever is an acute viral, mosquito-borne disease that affects domestic animals (such as sheep, cattle, and goats) and humans distributed in sub-Saharan African countries and the Arabian Peninsula. Camels have been regularly involved in the RVF epidemics in East Africa and Egypt. However, clinical disease is not seen in adult camels, but abortion occurs and some early deaths have been observed (OIE 2008) . Serological evidence of dromedary camel infection with RVF was documented. According to Davies et al. (1985) , camel sera collected after an epizootic of Rift Valley fever in Kenya revealed positive sera with high titers of serum neutralizing antibody found in 22 % of camels at one of the seven sampling sites. Furthermore, the demonstration of specific IgG antibodies in camels (Nabeth et al. 2001) indicates that these animals are naturally infected. The disease emerged in Egypt in 1977, in Mauritania in 1998 (Nabeth et al. 2001) , and in the Arabian Peninsula in 2000 (Abdo-Salem et al. 2006 ). In addition, the disease reappeared in Kenya in 2006 (Bird et al. 2008 . It also involved camels beside sheep, goats, and humans, again with abortion as the only clinical symptom.",

At least two forms can be identified: a per acute disease characterized by sudden death, abortion, and diarrhea with a high mortality rate occurred in the region during 2004 (Gluecks and Younan 2010 Dawo 2010; Khalafalla et al. 2010) , whereas the early outbreaks (1992) (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) showed an acute respiratory disease with low mortality rates (Roger et al. 2000) . The presence of more than one form points to involvement of other pathogens as secondary invaders or to the genetic variations of the causative virus. The last hypothesis was verified by detecting lineage III of PPRV from camels in Ethiopia in 1997 and lineage IV from camels affected by PPRV in 2004 in Sudan (Kwiatek et al. 2011 ). Kwiatek and coworkers (2011) suggested that a virulent lineage IV strain might have been introduced in Africa during the 1990s, resulting in outbreaks in both camels and small ruminants.",

The disease is considered to be one of the most important infections of domestic livestock. It is quite severe in sheep, less so in cattle. In June 2006, BTV appeared in northern Europe for the first time (Carpenter et al. 2009 ) and successfully wintered. Subsequently it caused substantial losses in livestock in 2007 and 2008. The virus has never previously occurred so far north anywhere in the world (Mellor et al. 2008) . The explanation to this dramatic change in the epidemiology of BT is many, but one is linked to the recent extension in the distribution of its main vector(s) Culicoides imicola and perhaps new Culicoides vector(s) and to the ongoing climatic change ). Alpacas and llamas are susceptible to BTV infections, but rarely show significant clinical signs. However, they remain infectious for several weeks and may thus serve as reservoirs of infection. Already Rivera et al. (1987) showed that camelids can be infected with BTV. About 100 sampled \"healthy\" alpacas were positive for specific antibodies against BVT. Although camelids are considered a \"low-risk species,\" there are reports of cases, e.g., during the recent outbreak of BT in Europe 2007 (Henrich et al. 2007) . One alpaca in the area that was affected in Germany during this outbreak was infected within a radius of 5 km from clinically BTVinfected sheep (with high mortality) and cattle. Ortega et al. (2010) described a fatal BTV infection in an alpaca (Vicugna pacos) in California. Meyer et al. (2009) described a lethal BTV infection in llamas. Vaccines are available and are used for ruminants. They are not licensed for SACs but may be used (Zanolari et al. 2010) and are recommended by many.",

Saudi Arabia is the country most severely affected by the virus and is where the first recognized case was reported in September 2012. The origin of MERS-CoV remains a mystery. Phylogenetic analyses of complete and partial genome sequences byCotten et al. (2013) enabled estimates of the timing of introduction and geographic distribution of distinct virus clades. The authors proposed that MERS-CoV emerged in humans in 2011 and noted that sequence divergence among clades is consistent with multiple sporadic introductions of the virus into the human population, presumably from an animal reservoir(Alagaili et al. 2014).Early observations that some MERS-CoV infected people had exposure to camels suggesting a possible role of this animal as an intermediate reservoir host(Milne- Price et al. 2014;Albarrak et al. 2012;Drosten et al. 2013). Serologic surveys subsequently conducted in several countries in the Arabian Peninsula and Africa have identified high rates of MERS-CoV-specific antibodies in camels(Hemida et al. 2013;Perera et al. 2013;Reusken et al. 2013;Meyer et al. 2014). Furthermore, researchers have found definitive proof that camels can be infected with MERS-CoV when viral genomic sequences were detected in nasal swabs collected in Qatar(Haagmans et al. 2014;Nowotny and Kolodziejek 2014), Saudi Arabia(Memish et al. 2014), and Egypt(Chu et al. 2014).Infection in camels Susceptibility of dromedary camels to and infection with MERS-CoV have been documented by the detection of high levels of antibodies to the virus and viral sequences in nasal swabs and lung tissues. Nevertheless, infection remained subclinical with only mild upper respiratory tract symptoms(Fig. 20.6) observed in some camels(Khalafalla et al. 2015). Experimental infection of dromedary camels with a human isolate of MERS-CoV induced no systemic illness despite shedding of large quantities of virus from the upper respiratory tract(Adney et al. 2014). It is therefore concluded that MERS-CoV causes no well-defined disease in camels.",

Though investigations in Somalia and Kenya were inconclusive and failed to identify the real causative agent, the disease in Sudan was diagnosed as a PPR virus (small ruminant virus) infection(Khalafalla et al. 2010). The incriminated virus belongs to the genus Morbillivirus in the family Paramyxoviridae-a group of RNA viruses characterized by continuous evolution and species jumping. Newly evolved viruses in this family include phocine distemper virus and Hendra virus, formerly called equine Morbillivirus(Earle et al. 2011).",
