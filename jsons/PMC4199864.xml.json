Within an endemic area in the Balkans, villages only a few kilometers apart may have very different patterns of risk, with some villages unaffected and others with high disease prevalence.8 The disease has been found at different elevations in different nations: about 100 m in Croatia, 130 m in Bosnia, 200 m in Serbia, and 200\u2013300 m in Romania.8, 9 A frequent history of flooding is common in all BEN\u2010endemic areas except Bulgaria, which has endemic areas located on well\u2010drained land.8 The estimated prevalence of BEN has varied over time, and may depend on the criteria used to diagnose the disease. Studies place BEN prevalence estimates at 0.5\u20134.4% in endemic areas across the Balkans in general, and suggest the incidence may be decreasing with time.10 On the other hand, in the Kolubara River region in Serbia, BEN prevalence was observed to increase from 6.4% in 1971 to 8.9% in 2002.11, 12 Current estimates of BEN prevalence in Croatia ranged from 0.3\u20132.3% with a mean of 1%.13\n",

Shindarov et al.24 failed to establish the presence of viruses in cultures prepared from kidneys of fatal BEN cases. Another viral explanation by Radovanovic25 speculates on the post\u2010WWII use of DDT in the Balkans and its relation to the cat population. As DDT use increased, the cat population decreased, causing an increase in rodents that could have vectored viruses potentially involved in causing BEN. However, the presence or absence of viruses, both specifically and generally, have not been found to be significantly different in BEN\u2010endemic versus non\u2010BEN\u2010endemic populations. Some bacteria such as Escherichia coli have been suggested as a cause of BEN due to a similar nephropathy induced in exposed laboratory animals.26 In humans, however, no bacteria was found in most BEN patients\u2019 urine samples.27 The body of evidence is inconclusive about the role of viruses and bacteria in BEN etiology.28\n",

Nearly 200 years ago, the toxicity of certain Aristolochia species was elucidated in humans and various animal species.69 However, it is still an ingredient in certain Chinese herbal medicines consumed worldwide. In the early 1990s, about 1,800 Belgian women who consumed weight loss supplements developed rapidly progressive renal interstitial fibrosis leading to chronic renal failure.70 Associated with these cases was the ingestion of Aristolochia fangchi, an ingredient in herbal medicines used as part of the weight\u2010loss program. Of those who ingested the herbal supplement, 5% developed end\u2010stage renal disease (ESRD). This combination of health effects was first named Chinese herbs nephropathy (CHN). Based on the finding of aristolactam DNA adducts (AL\u2010DNA) in the renal tissues of diseased patients,71 along with animal studies showing carcinogenic effects of AA on rabbits,72 CHN was renamed aristolochic acid nephropathy (AAN).",

As succinctly described in Long and Voice,18 more flooded areas with poor soil conditions and less cultivation had been associated with greater abundance of Aristolochia clematitis. Additionally, growers\u2019 methods of harvesting, threshing, and bundling the grains, which could commingle Aristolochia with cereal grains, would increase the likelihood that plant tissues containing AA could contaminate the food supply.

It is possible that OTA plays a contributory role in BEN, but is unlikely to cause the disease on its own; another risk factor such as AA must be present for the disease to be manifested. This is based on studies indicating that OTA exposure is higher in BEN\u2010endemic areas than non\u2010BEN\u2010endemic areas; however, other parts of the world with equally high OTA exposures do not report BEN incidence, and other parts of the world with disease manifestations similar to BEN do not have notably high OTA exposure. Dose\u2010response data linking OTA to BEN/related diseases are lacking in both animals and humans. Hence, OTA was generally ranked to have a \u201cmoderate\u201d plausibility of contributing to BEN.",

Some researchers believe they have established genotoxic modes of action for OTA by proving the ability of OTA to form DNA adducts.7 OTA\u2010DNA adducts have been found in the kidneys of both rats and mice,148 as well as in the liver and spleen of others,149 and similar adducts have been found in BEN patients' bladder and kidney tumors.88 On the other hand, many researchers have been unable to detect OTA\u2010DNA adducts in animals or humans46, 67, 93 and argue that any adverse effects of OTA are likely a result of some indirect mechanism involving oxidative stress150, 151 or cytotoxicity.93 Additionally, a lack of dose\u2010response data in humans and no analogous examples of diseases that OTA may cause in humans are major gaps in knowledge regarding OTA.",
