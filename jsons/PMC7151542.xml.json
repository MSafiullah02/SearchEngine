The second source was a letter written by Fang et al,4 where they claimed that ibuprofen may worsen associated symptoms in those infected with COVID-19. They argued that coronaviruses bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2, and ibuprofen administration can increase the bioavailability of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2, therefore potentiating and enhancing the infectious processes of coronaviruses.4\n",

These biases include protopathic bias, where ibuprofen is used to relieve symptoms of a viral infection, including COVID-19, making it seem like ibuprofen is the culprit. Confounding by disease severity (also referred to as channeling bias) should also be considered in many of these studies, especially those which compared this risk with nonusers. Patients with more severe viral infections including influenza or COVID-19 are more likely to use a stronger antiinflammatory drug such as ibuprofen than acetaminophen. Therefore, a potential harmful outcome is more likely to be caused by a more severe infection for which ibuprofen is prescribed, rather than the drug.",

Evidence from mechanistic studies alone should not be used to make strong statements against use of ibuprofen. Given the current strength of the evidence on this topic, we advise that patients use acetaminophen monotherapy for fever reduction in a patient with COVID-19, as per the WHO recommendations.3 If acetaminophen alone cannot achieve its antipyretic effect, the current evidence is not sufficient to advise against coadministration of ibuprofen with acetaminophen; however, risk of adding ibuprofen should still be assessed against its benefits.",
