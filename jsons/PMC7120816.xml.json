However, current egg-based vaccine production process can take up to 6 months for the development and availability of a strain-specific vaccine and antiviral supplies may be limited. Fortunately, alternative strategies such as non-pharmaceutical interventions can reduce the spread of influenza until a vaccine becomes available. Face masks have been used to combat airborne viruses such as the 1918\u20131919 pandemic influenza [4, 29], the 2003 SARS outbreak [7, 38], and the most recent 2009 H1N1 pandemic [12]. These studies indicate that if face masks are readily available, then they may be more cost-effective than other non-pharmaceutical interventions such as school and/or business closures [13].",

If worn properly, a surgical mask can help block large-particle droplets, splashes, sprays, or splatter that may contain germs (viruses and bacteria), and may also help reduce exposure of saliva and respiratory secretions to others. By design, they do not filter or block very small particles in the air that may be transmitted by coughs or sneezes.",

They observed that females and older adults were more likely to accept protective behaviors than other population groups. Supporting these ideas, usage of face masks was consistently higher among females than male metro passengers in Mexico City during the 2009 Influenza A (H1N1) pandemic [12]. Limited studies suggest that there is more social stigmatization associated with wearing face masks in Western Countries than in Asia. For example, people rarely wear face masks in public in the United States, compared with their use in Japan and China [17]. An article published in 2009 by New York Times Health reported that \u201cmasks scare people away from one another\u201d resulting in an unintentional social distancing measure [30] or \u201cstay away\u201d factor. Pang et al. showed that during the 2003 SARS outbreak, non-pharmaceutical interventions where implemented followed the epidemic curve [33]. That is, as the perception of SARS increased, more measures were implemented, and as the incidence declined, several measures were relaxed.",

In the case of interventions such as face mask use, where individuals often choose to comply or not comply in the privacy of their daily lives, traditional methods of measuring compliance may be ineffective. Accordingly, we turn to social internet systems, specifically Twitter, where users share short text messages called tweets. These messages are directed to varying audiences but are generally available to the public regardless; they are used to share feelings, interests, observations, desires, concerns, and the general chatter of daily life. While other researchers have used Twitter to measure public interest in various health topics, including face masks as an influenza intervention [35], we carry out a brief experiment to explore the feasibility of using tweets to measure behavior.",

The synthetic population consists of 20 million individuals living in 6 million households, with an additional 1 million locations representing actual schools, businesses, shops, or social recreation addresses. The synthetic population of southern California represents only individuals reported as household residents in the 2000 U.S. Census; therefore, the simulation ignores visiting tourists and does not explicitly treat guests in hotels or travelers in airports.",

Each building is further subdivided into rooms or mixing places. Schools have classrooms, work places have workrooms, and shopping malls have shops. Typical room sizes can be specified; for example, for workplaces, the mean workgroup size varies by standard industry classification (SIC) code. The number of sub-locations at each location is computed by dividing the location\u2019s peak occupancy by the appropriate mixing group size. We used two data sources to estimate the mean workgroup by SIC, including a study on employment density [45] and a study on commercial building usage from the Department of Energy [26]. The mean workgroup size was computed as the average from the two data sources (normalizing the worker density data) and ranges from 3.1 people for transportation workers to 25.4 for health service workers. The average over all types of work is 15.3 workers per workgroup. For the analyses presented here, the average mixing group sizes are: 8.5 people at a school, 4.4 at a shop, and 3.5 at a social recreation venue.",

In EpiSimS, an interaction between two individuals is represented only by:when they begin to occupy a mixing location together,how long they co-occupy within a mixing place,a high-level description of the activity they are engaged in, andthe ages of the two individuals.A location represents a street address, and a room or mixing place represents a lower-level place where people have face-to-face interactions. When an infectious person is in a mixing location with a susceptible person for some time, we estimate a probability of disease transmission, which depends on the last three variables listed above. Details of social interactions such as breathing, ventilation, fomites, moving around within a sub-location, coughing, sneezing, and conversation are not included. Disease transmission between patients and medical personnel is not handled explicitly, and no transmission occurs when traveling between activities. Note that individuals follow a static itinerary, except when they are sick or need to care for a sick child. In this case, their schedule changes and all activities they were supposed to undertake are changed to home.",

The incubation and symptomatic stage sojourn time distributions are described by a half-day histogram, giving respectively the fraction of cases that incubate for a period of between 0 and 0.5 days, 0.5 and 1.0 days, etc., before transitioning to the symptomatic or recovered stages, respectively. The average incubation time is 1.9 days and average duration of symptoms is 4.1 [25]. The influenza model assumes that 50 % of adults and seniors, 75 % of students, and 80 % of pre-schoolers will stay at home soon within 12 hrs of the onset of influenza symptoms. These people can then transmit disease only to household members or visitors. In addition, based on previous studies [25], we assume that 33.3 % of infections are subclinical where an infected individual is asymptomatic and shows no sign of infection. We modeled the subclinical manifestation as only half as infectious as the symptomatic manifestations. Persons with subclinical manifestations continue their normal activities as if they were not infected. The assumed hospitalization rate is a percentage of symptomatic individuals dependent on the strength of the pandemic. To simulate the higher attack rates seen in children, we assume that the infection rate in children was double that in adults. We analyze multiple scenarios for the same set of transmission parameters where the population was initially seeded with 100 people infected, all in the incubation stage.",

Early in the simulations, each individual determines whether they will wear a mask based on age, gender, and acceptance. This is the pool of people from which mask users are selected. When we assume that mask usage will follow the course of an epidemic (e.g., disease perception increases as incidence increases and vice-versa), mask usage ramps up and then down.

Although these non-pharmaceutical interventions may not be very effective when compared to vaccines and antivirals, the overall impact for people that adopt these behaviors is significantly lower than the epidemic curve for the entire population. Table 6 takes the new clinical attack rate for the M and HS and M and SD intervention strategies and computes their difference. Then, this difference is expressed in the table as a percentage of the base case clinical attack rate for that epidemic strength. This is meant to demonstrate the difference in the clinical attack rate relative to each intervention strategy on a scale that is proportional to the base case. If this percent is small then one could reasonably conclude that there is not much difference in the intervention strategies at that level. Overall, the scenarios with masks and hand sanitizer had a difference of less than 10 % of the base case clinical attack rate in all cases (see Table 7). The case of comparing M and HS implemented when 0.01 % of the population is symptomatic and M and SD when 1.0 % of the population is symptomatic is especially interesting at a low epidemic level, since the difference is less than 5 % even though M and SD has only a 30 % effectiveness compared to M and HS 50 % effectiveness.

Not surprisingly, our results show that face masks are more effective when coupled with other interventions. Although we expected that masks and hand sanitizers would have the largest return (given that we assume to be 50 % effective), social distancing performed almost as well as the hand sanitizer (even though we assume it was only 30 % effective). These observations imply that any mitigation that aims at reducing the probability of transmission, regardless of effectiveness, can contribute in reducing the overall impact of disease.

The intuition in exploring social internet systems such as Twitter to make these measurements is that the very high volume of observations, perceptions, and desires can, in aggregate, provide a sufficiently accurate measurement of compliance in real-world settings. Our preliminary results in analyzing Twitter are consistent with this intuition: we measured the use of face masks with a simple keyword-based approach, and both mentions of and observations of wearing face masks correlate strongly with CDC influenza incidence data.
