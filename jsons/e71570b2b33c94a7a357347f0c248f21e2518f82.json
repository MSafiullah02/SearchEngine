Coronavirus infections and outbreaks were already registered in the past decades in both humans and animals [8, 9] . Thus, investigating whether immunological features of taxonomically related viruses are shared with the SARS-CoV-2 might be helpful for planning innovative diagnostic and prophylactic interventions. According to the One-Health approach, defining the distribution of epitopes among viruses capable of infecting synanthropic and/or domestic animals might represent a key strategy for assessing the plausible occurrence of crossprotection elicited by the continuous inter-relation existing between human and animal population. In this view, exposure to epitopes from synanthropic animals might confer partial protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection. This would explain, at least in part, the early detection of class G immunoglobulins in newly infected subjects and the big divergence occurring in the clinical manifestation of the SARS-CoV-2 infections, other than preventing epitopes-exposed subjects from the severe form of COVID-19 [16] . Nucleocapsid protein is a highly conserved protein involved in the active phase of the viral infection. Being highly immunogenic is commonly targeted in studies aimed at developing alternative diagnostic tools and prophylactic strategies [11,14,17e19] . Multiple alignments of the whole protein sequences highlight a very high homology between the NC sequence of SARS-CoV-2 and bat RaTG13 CoV. This evidence does not reflect the overall genome alignments recently published where the draft whole-genome sequence of the pangolin coronavirus is clustered as the closest relative to SARS-CoV-2 [13] . Our outcomes, instead, highlight a closer functional relationship between the bat RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 than the pair pangolin CoV and SARS-CoV-2 when restricting the investigation to a key structural protein. Also, NC protein of pangolin CoV fails to align two epitope sequences, suggesting a separation between the functional adaptation and molecular evolution. Moreover, acknowledged the overall co-share of epitope sequences, the lack of epitope alignments might be of importance for an accurate With regard to epitopes distribution across viruses with tropism for synanthropic and/or domestic animals, the survey highlights that some epitope sequences are more \"conserved\" among the most related specimens, while other epitopes are shared among a wider ensemble of coronaviruses. Similar outcomes were also described for the spike proteins epitopes [20] .
