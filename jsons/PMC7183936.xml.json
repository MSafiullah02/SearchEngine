Even if someone has access to transportation, the time it takes to travel to a healthcare setting, wait for the appointment, and return home can take a half to a full day. Sometimes this appointment is for less than 10 minutes with the healthcare provider. Even those who live in cities often have less than ideal public transportation systems. When I was working at a Federally Qualified Health Center in the downtown area of a midsize city, I would see patients in the clinic in the morning and then see them waiting for the bus when I left in the late afternoon.",

Evidence has demonstrated telehealth\u2019s effectiveness in many situations.",
