Meanwhile, the impact of the time varying heterogeneity of host susceptibility on the shot-term behavior of epidemics is not well-studied, even though the large amount of the available epidemiological data are the short-term epidemics. Here we constructed a parsimonious mathematical model describing the short-term transmission dynamics taking into account natural-boosting immunity by reinfection, and obtained the explicit solution for our model. We found that our system show \"the delayed epidemic\", the epidemic takes off after negative slope of the epidemic curve at the initial phase of epidemic, in addition to the common classification in the standard SIR model, i.e., \"no epidemic\" as R 0 \u2264 1 or normal epidemic as R 0 > 1. Employing the explicit solution we derived the condition for each classification.",

The SIR model describes transmission of pathogen from infective individuals to susceptible individuals and removing infective individuals from the targeted host population due to the establishment of immunity or death of host or host immigration. Due to the wide variation in the natural history of pathogen, many extended models from the basic SIR model have been proposed so far.",

The basic SIR model describes that the host immunity perfectly protects the host from reinfection over time, then reinfection cannot occur forever. Meanwhile, reinfection events are observed frequently among many infectious diseases, e.g., Coronavirus [19] , Respiratory syncytial virus [14] , Tuberculosis [30] and Hepatitis C virus [29] . One of considerable mechanisms of reinfection is waning immunity. Decreased herd immunity by waning immunity of individuals induces re-emergence of epidemic, and boosting immunity by re-vaccination is required to control epidemics [4] . Another mechanism is imperfectness of immunity by an infection event. The booster dose of vaccine is required to establish the high enough immunity level to protect hosts from reinfection [28] , this implies that the multiple exposures to the pathogen is required to establish the high enough immunity level. Moreover, the enhancement of susceptibility to reinfection is also observed among several infectious diseases [31, 23] .",

Destabilization of the endemic equilibrium was shown to be possible for epidemic models with waning immunity [8, 15, 27] . Previous modeling studies showed that waning and natural-boosting immunity by exposure to the pathogens can trigger a counter-intuitive effect of vaccination [26] . It is suggested that waning immunity in vaccinated hosts can trigger backward bifurcation of the endemic equilibrium [2, 5, 25] . Estimating the vaccine effectiveness is essential to control epidemics, however, vaccine effectiveness reflects the complicated epidemiological dynamics which is scaled by waning and natural-boosting immunity, e.g., boosting and waning immunity can induce the periodic outbreak for the long-term behavior [3] .",

Similar phenomena can be observed in epidemic models that show backward bifurcation of the endemic equilibrium [2, 5, 13, 18, 25] . In those studies it is shown that there is a stable endemic equilibrium even if the basic reproduction number is less than unity. Differently from those models, the short-term disease transmission dynamics model have many equilibria, which are associated to the zero eigenvalue.
