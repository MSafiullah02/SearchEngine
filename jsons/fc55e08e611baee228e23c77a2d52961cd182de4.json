Historical emergence of PA as a major pathogen in CF centers is part of what led to the development of the Infection Prevention and Control Clinical Care Guidelines [9] . The sputum prevalence of PA increases with age from rates of less than 20% in 5-yearolds to 70% or more by the age of 30 [5] . PA thus becomes a major cause of pulmonary exacerbations in adult patients. PA is incredibly adaptable. De novo mutations are commonplace for PA; while the initial clone may remain the most clinically apparent strain for many years, phenotypically distinct strains can develop hidden within segregated microcolonies [10] . PA virulence factors can also change based on interactions with the host or other bacteria. One example is PA's increased production of pyocyanin when exposed to some gram-positive bacteria [1] .",

ABPA is characterized by clinical worsening with cough, wheezing, and decline in pulmonary function without another known cause. Diagnosis of ABPA requires elevated total IgE levels and evidence of allergic sensitization to Aspergillus (either positive specific IgE or positive skin prick test). Other findings may include anti-Aspergillus IgG, peripheral eosinophilia, or chest imaging [39] .

Historically, there has been a lack of consensus on the definition of PEx [59] . In retrospective studies, PEx are often identified by the administration of intravenous antibiotics due to pulmonary symptoms. Many other criteria have been suggested. All include some combination of the following symptoms: an increase in sputum volume or color, new or increased hemoptysis, increased cough, increased dyspnea, malaise, fatigue, temperature > 38C, anorexia/weight loss, sinus pain, change in sinus discharge, change in physical examination of the chest, decrease in pulmonary function by \u226510%, or radiographic changes in support of a pulmonary infection [1, 60, 61] . According to the STOP trial, which gathered data on current practices across CF Foundation-accredited care centers, most clinicians also rely on an acute drop in lung function to diagnose a PEx [62] . There is no well-accepted method to further classify a PEx by its severity. Many biomarkers have been considered as PEx diagnostic aids, but to date none have been performed acceptably well for clinical use. Procalcitonin, CRP, IL-18, and IL-6 have all been generally unhelpful in predicting an imminent exacerbation [63] . Calprotectin does demonstrate some early promise with some ability to predict PEx, but its clinical utility remains unclear [64] . Matouk et al. showed that patients with a higher hsCRP were more likely to have more clinically active disease and future PEx [65] . Biomarker panels may prove to be more useful than any single biomarker. One example, the MRM-MS protein panel which compiled six biomarkers, was better able to identify patients with imminent PEx than using FEV1 alone [66] .",

However, antibiotic choice should be individualized, and other options for therapy include trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, doxycycline, minocycline, clindamycin, levofloxacin, teicoplanin, and rifampin [62] . It should be noted that vancomycin does not penetrate biofilm, and vancomycin resistance also confers teicoplanin resistance [73] . Doxycycline should not typically be used in patients less than 8 years old. Linezolid has several potential side effects including serotonin syndrome, irreversible neuropathy, and severe lactic acidosis. Resistance to linezolid is increasing as it is used more frequently [73] .

The STAR-TOO trial found that eradication of new MRSA infections was feasible for most (not all) newly infected CF patients, which may suggest a long-term clinical benefit. Their treatment protocol included oral antibiotics, decolonization (with nasal mupirocin, chlorhexidine body and mouth washes), and enhanced household cleaning [81] . However, in persistently infected CF patients, MRSA eradication rates remained poor even with the addition of inhaled vancomycin in the Persistent MRSA Eradication Protocol (PMEP) trial. Furthermore, inhaled vancomycin caused intolerable bronchospasms in some patients [82] .",

Although beta-lactam serum drug levels are not routinely measured, significant changes in antibiotic clearance can occur during PEx. An average increased clearance of 20% results in beta-lactam levels being therapeutic only 45% of the time, which seems to have implications on airway microbiome [87, 88] .
