The lack of clinician experience with these diseases can impede rapid diagnosis and reporting to public health authorities [5]. The main obstacle in identifying a biological attack (BA), while preventing false alarms, epidemics of panic and unnecessary expenditures is the lack of data to rely on [23]. We are trained to consider common causes for syndromes first \u2013 and unless we have a high level of suspicion \u2013 we may not realize that we need to apply non-standard methods to identify an intentional use and to detect the kind of biological agents that a terrorist might use. Basically, any unexpected occurrence of one or more patients or deaths in humans or animals which might have been caused by an intentional release of pathogens may be the first clue of an unusual epidemic event (UEE). Also, the occurrence of a single case or death caused by an unknown or already eradicated disease or agent may be considered as \u201cunusual\u201d.",

            "text": "\nType of agent. There are two types of biological agents: conventional (natural form of the pathogen) and biological warfare agent. A qualitative parameter may be if some pathogen species or strain (subspecies) is unusual, atypical or antiquated, e.g. is identified in the region concerned for the first time ever or again after a long absence, or if an agent has certain characteristics like: a special genetic signature, mixed with a stabilizing agent, highly concentrated, filled in munitions, high toxicity, more virulent, resistant to antibiotics, and multiple modes of transmission. Many potential biological warfare agents could be obtained from natural sources (infected animals, patients, or contaminated soil). Many pathogens, perhaps the majority concerned, cause zoonoses, i.e. infect animals as well as humans [16]. The sudden occurrence of a zoonotic disease, such as brucellosis, in the absence of the natural animal host or reservoir and other likely sources of transmission may be suggestive of an unnatural cause. The so-called \u201czoonotic\u201d potential should be considered in this differentiating evaluation. A regionalized animal die-off may provide a clue that something is present or may have been released that might also infect humans. This phenomenon of animal illness heralding human illness was observed during the West Nile virus encephalitis outbreak in New York City in 1999, when many local crows, along with exotic birds at the Bronx Zoo, died [17, 24]. In the case of a so-called \u201creverse spread\u201d, where human disease precedes animal disease, or human and animal disease occur simultaneously, one should consider an unnatural spread. This is often also the case in plague or tularemia outbreaks and has led to speculations like in Surat (India) in 1994 or Kosovo. Many strains isolated from nature have low virulence. Therefore, a terrorist must isolate many different strains before finding one sufficiently potent as a warfare agent. Considering the technical difficulties to obtain virulent microorganisms from nature, terrorists may find it easier to steal well-characterized strains from a research laboratory, or to purchase the known pathogenic strains from a national culture collection or commercial supplier. Between 1985 and 1989, the Iraqi government ordered virulent strains of anthrax and other pathogens from culture collections in France and the United States, presumably for public health research \u2013 a purpose that was legal at the time, and approved by the U.S. Department of Commerce [25, 26]. It is speculated that one reason for the lack of success in causing illness following dissemination of anthrax spores by the cult Aum Shinrikyo was the inadvertent selection of a non-pathogenic strain of Bacillus anthracis [14].",

If food, water, or fomites are the media of delivery it should be possible to trace it and find out the source of infection and type (natural or artificial) of epidemic. But, air as a medium of delivery remains the most complicated for investigation. Looking for people who came in contact with the agent through this method of exposure may be very difficult. However, several other parameters may help (type, strain and approximate amount of released agent, period of incubation, and period of communicability). Also, natural epidemics will feature paths of transmission that are typical for the pathogen and its natural hosts. Such deviations from natural paths of infection could indicate that biological agents have been deliberately disseminated. Many diseases exhibit vastly different clinical presentations, periods of incubation, and mortality rates depending upon the route of transmission. Therefore, outbreaks due to an atypical route of transmission, particularly aerosol transmission, such as in the inhalation anthrax example above, are more suggestive of an intentional use. Weather factors, especially wind direction, temperature, and humidity, are important determinants of pathogen dissemination and disease occurrence and must be taken into account in an outbreak investigation. A disease outbreak occurring downwind (or downriver) of a suspected biological warfare agent production facility, such as in the Sverdlovsk anthrax disaster, provides compelling evidence for an accidental or intentional release [27]. It is useful to plot locations where cases occur on a geographic map. If affected cases are clustered in a downwind pattern, an aerosol release should be considered like in the 1979 anthrax outbreak in Sverdlovsk [7].",

Tourists, military personnel, traders, settlers and immigrants, and travel adventurers may carry new pathogens to unsuspecting and susceptible populations. People, storms, and floods can transport arthropods, rodents, snails, birds, and other creatures that can also bring new infections to previously unaffected areas. Changes in human behaviour, technologic devices, the environment, institutional living, and poor nutrition or vitamin deficits can spark new epidemics. The speed at which an epidemic spreads is determined by the virulence, resistance and concentration of the pathogen, the contagiousness of the disease and the intensity of the transmission process, on the one hand, and on the susceptibility and disposition of the exposed population, on the other. It is unclear how changes in household sizes, working patterns, and mobility would affect transmission patterns today. Incorporating detailed data on demographics and human mobility into spatially explicit models offers one method by which such extrapolation can be made more reliable, but the scale of changes mean that much uncertainty will inevitably remain.",

Until the epidemic in New York City in 1999, West Nile virus had never been isolated in the Western hemisphere. Many diseases, such as dengue fever in Cuba having been imported from Vietnam, or vivax malaria in Korea, represent a re-establishment of endemic transmission in areas from which they were once eradicated. About 40 new pathogens have been found in the last 35 years [11]. The United States was caught off-guard by the increasing AIDS epidemic that began in the early 1980s. Today, the AIDS epidemic \u2013 at the beginning of the twenty-first century \u2013 is worse than the worst-case scenarios that were predicted in the early 1990s.

Repeated visits by individuals or vehicles must be identified. The impact of secrecy has been evident in some recent incidents. Such an incident occurred in the aftermath of the 2001 anthrax letter attacks. Although the US Postal Service and the CDC knew that the Brentwood postal facility in Washington, D.C., was contaminated, they waited for 4 days before closing the facility and treating workers with antibiotics. By that time, one worker had died of anthrax, another was close to death, and two were gravely ill. Another example is China in 2003, when the government denied the SARS epidemic for 6 weeks, causing international alarm and spread of the disease. These examples illustrate that government secrecy is a persistent jeopardy, leaves the public in ignorance, and allows narrow-minded political agendas to undermine healthcare goals. Personal control includes physical control of people (their health status) and behavioral control (CV review, control of suspect behavior, control of contacts) [19].",
