There is a growing interest in stilbene derivatives because many activities have been observed in some of the naturally occurring as well as some of the synthetic stilbenes. Activities include antimicrobial [1], [2], [3], antioxidant [4], [5], antileukemic [6], anti-platelet aggregative [7], [8], protein tyrosine kinase inhibitory [9], anti-inflammatory [10], [11], anticarcinogenic activity [12], [13], anti-HIV [14], [15] and anti-herpes simplex virus [16]. In the course of our research for potential activities of stilbene derivatives, we designed different hydroxyl substituted sites against resveratrol and kept the trans structure to simulate this kind of phytoalexins.",

The result was exciting that the change of hydroxyl group's site and the introduction of nitrogen atom were beneficial to the anti-SARS activity. Especially the substituted sites of hydroxyl groups in compounds 17 and 19 have been demonstrated to be a key structure element of anti-SARS virus.",

According to this scheme, 3,5-dimethoxybenzyl bromide, 2-chloromethyl-3, 4-dimethoxy pyridine or 2-chloromethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-methoxypyridine were heated with triethyl phosphite in the presence of (n-Bu)4NI to give the phosphonates (2\u20134) (Michaelis\u2013Arbuzov reaction [17]). In turn, the reaction of aryl aldehyde with the anion of phosphates formed in situ with sodium hydride gave (E)-stilbene derivatives (5\u201314) (with almost none of (Z)-isomer) together with water soluble diethyl phosphate (Wittig\u2013Horner reaction [18], [19]). But the yield of pyridine containing derivatives is poor. Further methoxyl derivatives were demethylated with BBr3 in dichloromethane.",

Cytotoxicity in Vero E6 cells was measured before the antiviral activity. The compounds that showed cytotoxity to Vero E6 were weeded out first. The remainder was studied their inhibitory activity. Only compounds 17 and 19 could inhibit the replication of SARS virus in Vero E6 cells in concentration \u2264 0.5 mg ml\u20131 (2.05 mM). There was no cytotoxicity to Vero E6 in concentration \u2265 2 mg ml\u20131 (8.20 mM) (Table 3\n). It showed that both of them could inhibit SARS virus in vitro. Compounds 17 and 19 clearly inhibited the cytopathic effect (CPE) induced by infection with SARS-CoV (Fig. 1\n). As compared with cinanserin which inhibits SARS virus at 66 \u03bcM (IC90) [20], the result in our research seems to be not so good. But the concentration 0.5 mg ml\u20131 is not the terminal of the inhibition, because our research could not undergo in present situation in our country.",
