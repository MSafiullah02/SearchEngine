The combination of amino acids and bulky hydroxycarboxylic acids represents a formidable challenge for a solid-phase synthesis, which is on the other hand a prerequisite for the preparation of larger compound collections needed for biological screening. The stepwise assembly of such compounds is expected to be particularly difficult when N-methyl amino acids are involved.8 Due to the increased steric hindrance couplings need more time with the consequence that dioxomorpholine formation and epimerization can become the predominant side-reactions.9, 10, 11 The difficulties, resulting from the stepwise assemblage of N-methyl amino acids have been impressively demonstrated in several cyclosporine syntheses.12, 13\n",

However, both of them have their own problems when ester bonds are involved. The basic conditions needed for the removal of the Fmoc-group may cause a partial ester cleavage, diketopiperazine formation and enhanced racemization of the chiral hydroxy acids. On the other hand, Fmoc-protecting schemes are well established for standard supports, such as the Wang-resin and can be easily adapted on a peptide synthesizer. Diketopiperazine formation is drastically reduced or even suppressed under the strong acidic cleavage conditions used for the cleavage of Boc protecting groups. However, activated ester bonds as those from PhLac for instance, may be affected, too. Additionally, the resins compatible with Boc-protecting, mainly the Kaiser-oxime and the PAM-resin are significantly more expensive and have lower loadings compared to Wang-resin.",

Furthermore, PF1022A can be easily separated from non-cyclized by-products by flash-chromatography with silica gel due to its considerably higher lipophilicity. The unusual high macrocyclization yield can be attributed to a cis-amide bond between a leucine and lactic acid, which brings the N- and C-terminus in close proximity and thus facilitates the cylization reaction.39 PF1022A (1) obtained by synthesis was completely identical with respect to biological and spectroscopical data with a natural reference sample.",
