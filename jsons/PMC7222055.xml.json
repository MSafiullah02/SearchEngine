            "text": "Pseudomonas syringae induces a variety of symptoms such as leaf spots, cankers, galls, wilt, and blights on different plants, and can be classified into more than 50 pathovars (pv.) based on their host plant specificities and disease symptoms (Mansfield et al. 2012; Xin and He 2013). P. syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa), causal agent of bacterial canker of kiwifruit, is an economically important pathogen worldwide. First reported in Japan, Psa causes severe damage to kiwifruit plants and decreases yields under optimal conditions (Scortichini et al. 2012; Takikawa et al. 1989). Psa is organized into five biovars including biovar 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 based on biochemical, pathogenicity, and molecular characteristics of the Psa strains (Fujikawa and Sawada 2016, 2019). The emergence of Psa3 strains with enhanced virulence was reported in 2008 in Italy, and a pandemic spread rapidly to kiwifruit production areas worldwide (Scortichini et al. 2012). Major control strategies include chemical treatments such as copper fungicides and antibiotics (Cameron and Sarojini 2013), but they are associated with potential risks such as induction of Psa resistance strains, phytotoxicity, and chemical residues in fruits (Nakajima et al. 2002; Serizawa et al. 1989; Vanneste and Voyle 2003). Breeding for resistance is another control strategy, but cultivar development is slow (Kisaki et al. 2019). Therefore, alternative management strategies based on the dissection of the dynamic interactions between Psa and kiwifruit are urgently needed.",

Syringe pressure infiltration is the most commonly used method (Kisaki et al. 2019). Conventional soil-grown plant inoculation assays have included stem puncture inoculation, syringe pressure infiltration, and spray inoculation were used to study the interactions between Psa and kiwifruit (Bartoli et al. 2015; Gao et al. 2016; Kisaki et al. 2019). However, to functionally investigate the molecular interactions between plants and P. syringae, the inoculation assay should mimic natural infection and be suitable for high-throughput assays. P. syringae has two lifestyles, an epiphytic phase on the plant leaf surface and an endophytic phase in the apoplastic space (Melotto et al. 2008; Xin and He 2013). The bacterium generally enters host tissues through natural openings such as stomata and multiplies in the apoplast to cause disease in nature (Lindow and Brandl 2003).",

The pDSK-GFPuv vector was introduced into each Psa biovar by electroporation (Wang et al. 2007). All Psa strains were grown at 28 \u00b0C on King\u2019s B (KB) (King et al. 1954) agar.

For expression profiles in culture conditions, Psa3 was grown in LB broth for 24 h, then adjusted to OD600 of 0.1 with fresh LB broth and grown for 3 h to investigate the expression profiles during the exponential phase, not the stationary phase. Total RNA was extracted from kiwifruit seedlings by an ultrasonication method as described (Yu et al. 2013). Briefly, 12 plants were collected, immediately submerged in 5 ml of RNAlater Stabilization Solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), sonicated for 7 min, then plants were removed from the solution. The bacterial cells in the suspension were harvested by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 2 min, and cell pellets were used for subsequent purification. Total RNA was extracted using Reliaprep (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Two micrograms of total RNA was treated with gDNA Remover (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan) to eliminate genomic DNA, and the DNase-treated RNA was reverse transcribed using the ReverTra Ace qPCR RT Master Mix (TOYOBO). The cDNA (1:20) was then used for qRT-PCR that was performed using the primers shown in supplementary Table S1 with THUNDERBIRD\u00ae SYBR qPCR Mix (TOYOBO) on a Thermal Cycler Dice Real Time System (TaKaRa, Kusatsu, Japan). Three genes encoding fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, chromosome participating protein ParA, and a TetR family transcriptional regulator were used for normalizing the results (McAtee et al. 2018).",

Psa1- and Psa3-inoculated seedlings showed necrosis within 1 wpi, and severe disease symptoms at 2 wpi (Fig. 2a). Among the Psa biovars, Psa3 caused the most severe symptoms (Fig. 2a). Symptoms on Psa5-inoculated seedlings developed slower during the first compared to those on Psa1- and Psa3-inoculated seedlings, but developed typical symptoms such as leaf spots at 2 wpi (Fig. 2a). Typical disease symptoms such as leaf spots can be seen in magnified images of Psa1-, Psa3-, and Psa5-inoculated seedlings at 2 wpi (Fig. 2a, bottom row). On the other hand, symptoms on seedlings-inoculated with Psa6 were only observed at 2 wpi (Fig. 2a). Mild symptoms such as chlorosis without leaf spots can be seen in the magnified image of Psa6-inoculated seedlings. These results suggest that Psa6 shows the least virulence among the Psa biovars (Fig. 2a, bottom row). Consistent with symptom development caused by the different biovars, Psa3 populations were the highest compared to those of Psa1, Psa5, and Psa6 (Fig. 2b), and Psa6 populations were the lowest. We also observed bacterial colonies in kiwifruit seedlings by labeling the Psa biovars with the GFPuv protein. Interestingly, the bacterial colonies were clearly observed in Psa1- and Psa3-inoculated seedlings at 6 days post inoculation (Fig. 2c). To evaluate the utility of the kiwifruit seedling-flood inoculation assay for studying nonhost interactions, we inoculated kiwifruit seedlings with P. syringae pv. tomato strain DC3000 (Pst DC3000). Pst DC3000 did not induce HR cell death in the healthy-looking inoculated seedlings by 1 wpi (Supplementary Fig. S1a). Pst DC3000 bacterial populations were also lower than those of Psa3 (Supplementary Fig. S1b). Together, these results suggest that the kiwifruit seedling flood-inoculation assay is a reliable method to study Psa disease progression and to evaluate in planta bacterial growth.",

However, severe necrosis was not observed on hrcN mutant-inoculated seedlings and leaves (Fig. 3a and b). Consistent with disease development, the bacterial populations of the hrcN mutant were approximately 1000-fold lower compared to wild-type Psa3 after both inoculation methods (Fig. 3c and d). These results indicate that the T3SS has important roles in bacterial multiplication, persistence, and disease symptom development of Psa3 in kiwifruit seedlings, and in soil-grown kiwifruit plants.

We thus investigated the expression profiles of these genes in wild-type Psa3 using RT-qPCR and gene-specific primer sets according to a previous study (McAtee et al. 2018; Supplementary Table S1). We carried out expression analysis using RNAs from flood-inoculated seedlings (Fig. 4a\u2013h) and spray-inoculated plant leaves similar to the method used for Fig. 3 (Fig. 4i\u2013p). Our results demonstrated that expression of the alternative sigma factor hrpL, which controls the expression of T3SS effectors (T3SEs) (Fouts et al. 2002), was clearly induced in planta (in flood- and in spray-inoculated kiwifruit plants) compared to culture in LB broth (Fig. 4a and i). In addition, the expression of Psa-conserved T3SS and T3SEs genes, including hrpA1, avrRpm1, hopR1, and hopZ3 were also induced in planta (Fig. 4j\u2013l), indicating that the T3SS is activated during Psa3 infection. We also investigated other P. syringae virulence genes (Ichinose et al. 2013; Ishiga et al. 2018; Ishiga and Ichinose 2016). The oxyR and fliC transcripts, encoding transcription factors related to oxidative stress (Ishiga and Ichinose 2016) and flagellin (Shimizu et al. 2003), respectively, were reduced in planta compared to levels produced in broth culture (Fig. 4f, g, and o). The expression of algD encoding an alginate biosynthesis enzyme (Yu et al. 1999) was induced in planta (Fig. 4h and p). Overall, we found that expression trends for most genes were the same between the two types of inoculation methods (Fig. 4).

Our method has several advantages over previous conventional soil-grown plant inoculation assays (Bartoli et al. 2015; Gao et al. 2016; Kisaki et al. 2019), including a shorter growth and incubation period, ease of inoculation and handling, uniformity of infection and disease development, and need for less growth chamber space (Fig. 1). This new method is suitable not only for dissecting the dynamic interactions between Psa and kiwifruit, but also for high-throughput screening for Psa virulence mutants, to further develop critical management strategies for bacterial canker of kiwifruit.",

One reason to explain the differences in the GFPuv intensity and the population size between Psa5 and Psa1 could be differences in colonization sites. P. syringae pathovars are known to have different lifestyles (Lindow and Brandl 2003; Xin and He 2013).

We demonstrated that a T3SS deficient Psa hrpN mutant impaired virulence not only in kiwifruit seedlings, but also in soil-grown plants (Fig. 3), indicating that the T3SS has an important role in Psa3 virulence. In addition, several studies reported that each Psa strain has T3SEs that are conserved among biovars as well as a unique set (Fujikawa and Sawada 2016, 2019; McCann et al. 2013; Zhao et al. 2019). However, the molecular function of the T3SEs in Psa is largely unknown. Therefore, it is important to investigate the molecular basis of the T3SEs in the virulence of Psa biovars, and the flood-inoculation assay will be a robust method.",

Several transcriptome studies have been performed using different P. syringae pathovars including P. syringae pv. syringae (Pss) B728a, P. syringae pv. tomato (Pst) DC3000, and Psa3 (McAtee et al. 2018; Nobori et al. 2018; Yu et al. 2013). Yu et al. (2013) showed that expression of genes encoding the T3SS and T3SEs in Pss B728a was not strongly induced in the apoplast. In contrast, these genes were greatly upregulated in planta in comprehensive analyses of the expression profiles of Pst DC3000 and Psa3 (McAtee et al. 2018; Nobori et al. 2018). One reason to explain the differences in the T3SS and T3SEs expression profiles in planta among P. syringae pathovars is their different lifestyles. Pss is known as a particularly successful epiphyte, whereas Pst DC3000 is a weak epiphyte (Lindow and Brandl 2003; Xin and He 2013). A putative epiphytic phase was suggested for Psa3 on asymptomatic flowers and leaves (Gallelli et al. 2011; Stefani and Giovanardi 2011); however, how Psa modulates the epiphytic and endophytic phases and which genes arerequired for these phases has not been fully ascertained. Understanding Psa lifestyles will be critical to developing new management strategies for bacterial canker of kiwifruit. We believe that the flood-inoculation method will enable us to identify Psa genes required not only for virulence but also for epiphytic fitness and will provide critical clues to develop effective control strategies.",
