Categorical variables were compared with the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test where appropriate. Continuous variables were compared using the Student's t-test once normality was demonstrated; otherwise the nonparametric Mann\u2013Whitney U test was performed. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify variables predictive of patients with bacterial co-infection (dependent variable). The variables analyzed were: age, gender, body mass index (BMI), smoking, alcohol consumption, previous antibiotic, influenza vaccination, pneumococcal vaccination, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, neurological disease, chronic renal disease, chronic liver disease, Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) risk class, serum creatinine, serum creatinine kinase, serum lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, leukocyte, platelets, mechanical ventilation, septic shock, and multilobar infiltration. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to predict 30-day mortality (dependent variable). The independent variables analyzed were those mentioned above plus, Pa02/Fio2, mechanical ventilation, bacterial co-infection, bacteremia and ARDS criteria. Variables that showed a significant result univariately (p < 0.1) were included in the multivariate logistic regression backward stepwise model to determine which of them were independently related to prognosis. The Hosmer\u2013Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test was performed to assess the overall fit of the model.20 The predictive capacity for bacterial co-infection of continuous variables was assessed with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves; the area under the curve (AUC), optimal cut-off value, sensitivity, specificity, predictive positive value, predictive negative value, positive likelihood ratio, and negative likelihood ratio were calculated. All tests were two-tailed and significance was set at 5%. All analyses were performed with SPSS version 16.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA).",

Underlying COPD and increasing platelet counts were independently predictive of the presence of bacterial co-infection in our series. Previous tracheobronchial colonization is frequent in COPD patients.31 Bacterial pathogens such as S. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa are frequently reported in COPD exacerbations of bacterial etiology,32, 33, 34 and this may explain the presence of these bacteria as the most frequent bacterial isolates in our patients. Thrombocytosis, as well as thrombocytopenia, was recently described as independent predictor of death from CAP.35 Platelets are inflammatory cells with an important role in antimicrobial host defenses and hence appear to be a marker of bacterial infection in patients with CAP.",
