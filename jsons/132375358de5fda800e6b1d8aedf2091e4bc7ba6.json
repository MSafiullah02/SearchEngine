            "text": "The three unprecedented outbreaks of emerging human coronavirus (HCoV) infections at the beginning of the twentyfirst century have highlighted the necessity for readily available, accurate and fast diagnostic testing methods. The laboratory diagnostic methods for human coronavirus infections have evolved substantially, with the development of novel assays as well as the availability of updated tests for emerging ones. Newer laboratory methods are fast, highly sensitive and specific, and are gradually replacing the conventional gold standards. This presentation reviews the current laboratory methods available for testing coronaviruses by focusing on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak going on in Wuhan. Viral pneumonias typically do not result in the production of purulent sputum. Thus, a nasopharyngeal swab is usually the collection method used to obtain a specimen for testing. Nasopharyngeal specimens may miss some infections; a deeper specimen may need to be obtained by bronchoscopy. Alternatively, repeated testing can be used because over time, the likelihood of the SARS-CoV-2 being present in the nasopharynx increases. Several integrated, random-access, point-of-care molecular devices are currently under development for fast and accurate diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections. These assays are simple, fast and safe and can be used in the local hospitals and clinics bearing the burden of identifying and treating patients.",

In temperate regions endemic HCoVs usually display a winter seasonality, although HCoV-229E has been detected sporadically throughout the year [12] . Endemic HCoVs are globally distributed and are maintained in the human population. The SARS-CoV pandemic came to an end in 2003 (https://www.who.int/csr/resources/ publications/CDS_CSR_ARO_2004_2.pdf?ua=1. Accessed 3 February 2020), less than a year after the first reported case. In contrast, human cases caused by MERS-CoV continue to be reported at the time of writing, more than seven years after the first reported case. Most laboratory-confirmed MERS cases have occurred in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, and the majority of those in Saudi Arabia. Unlike the endemic HCoVs, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are maintained in zoonotic reservoirs. The SARS and MERS outbreaks were driven in part by super-spreading events in which individuals directly infected a disproportionally large number of contacts [13] . The SARS-CoV-2-caused coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) epidemic originated in a Wuhan, China market that sold exotic animals for consumption. Based on genetic relatedness to other betacoronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 likely has a zoonotic reservoir. However, the precise source of SARS-CoV-2 that initially infected humans remains to be confirmed. The SARS-CoV-2 appears to be substantially more contagious than SARS-CoV ( Table 1 ). The distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in different mammalian species is unknown. An interesting question is the susceptibility of farm animals and pets, and their role in the epidemiologic cycle as their angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor shares similarity with human ACE2 [14] .",

Following an incubation period of usually 4-5 days, patients infected with SARS-CoV often present with symptoms of fever, headache, and myalgias. Respiratory symptoms including cough and dyspnoea usually develop from several days to a week after illness onset. Atypical pneumonia and respiratory deterioration occur in 20-30% of cases. The incubation period and clinical course of MERS are similar to that of SARS, the exception being a higher proportion of cases progressing to respiratory deterioration and distress. The incubation period and clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection are probably similar to that of SARS. Li et al. first reported a mean incubation period of 5.2 days [15] . Fever and cough are frequently reported early in the course of illness [16, 17] . Infections are also characterized by dyspnoea, respiratory distress and positive chest X-ray [10] .

Accessed 3 February 2020). Between September 2012 and November 2019, there were 2494 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS, with 858 deaths (https://www.who.int/emergencies/merscov/en/. Accessed 4 February 2020). The MERS casefatality rate of 34.4% is about triple that of SARS, and persons in the 50-59 year age group are at highest risk for primary cases. In the short time from its emergence in December 2019 to 15 March 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 has been reported in 134 countries. At the time of writing, the situation was evolving rapidly, with over 142,000 confirmed cases reported globally (over 81,000 in China) and 3194 deaths in China (3.9% case-fatality rate) and over 2100 deaths outside of China. Of countries and continents outside of China, South Korea, Iran, and Europe (particularly Italy) have experienced a high number of COVID-19 cases (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coro navirus-2019/situation-reports/. Accessed 15 March 2020). Mortality rates vary widely, and depend on the age of patients, underlying risk factors, and the denominator definitionhospitalized cases, all symptomatic cases, only moderate to severe cases, etc. In a study of adult patients (mean age 59.7 y; 40% with chronic illnesses) with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), 61.5% died within 28 days [18] . In contrast, a study of hospitalized patients (median age 47.5 years) across Beijing showed [8, 20, 22, 59] 18% of cases to be severe and 73% mild, with a fatality rate of 0.9% [19] . Mortality is highest in older persons, with a median age of 59-75 years [15, 17] . Treatment for all severe HCoV infections is supportive although a randomized, double-blinded, control clinical trial has been conducted on a Gilead drug Remdesivir [20] Based on one study focused on children, a total of 28 children aged from 1 month to 17 years have been reported in China. All paediatric cases with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were mild cases with no deaths reported [21] . During the first 2 months of the current outbreak, COVID-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness with a death rate of 1.3%. Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings [22] . The Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention team analysed more than 72,000 patient records, of which 44,672 were laboratory-confirmed cases, 16,186 suspected cases, 10,567 clinically diagnosed cases, and 889 asymptomatic cases. Of the confirmed cases, about 14% of the illnesses were severe, which included pneumonia and shortness of breath, and about 5% have the critical disease, marked by respiratory failure, septic shock, and multi-organ failure. The overall case-fatality rate was 2.3%, and of 1023 deaths included in the study, the majority were in people age 60 and older or those with underlying medical conditions http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/ 2020/02/more-outbreak-details-emerge-covid-19-casestop-70000 (Accessed 18 February 2020).",

Wang et al have just reported that oropharyngeal (OP) swabs (n = 398) were used much more frequently than NP swabs (n = 8) in China during the COVID-19 outbreak; however, the SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected only in 32% of OP swabs, which was significantly lower than that in NP swabs (63%) [25] . The US centers for disease control and prevention (CDC) recommends collecting the upper respiratory NP swab. Collection of an OP specimen is a lower priority, and, if collected, should be combined in the same tube as the NP swab (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/ 2019-nCoV/lab/guidelines-clinical-specimens.html.

However, the collection of sputum and particularly BAL via bronchoscopy increases biosafety risk to healthcare workers through the creation of aerosol droplets. Proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE) by healthcare workers is important. Bronchoscopy is a highly technical procedure requiring well-trained staff and may not be available in many parts of the world. Upper respiratory specimens are easy to collect, thereby increasing access to testing for patients with mild symptoms, and in the resource limited settings. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV RNA are also detected from stool, urine and blood specimens, although generally less reliably than from respiratory specimens [26] [27] [28] ]. An exception is SARS-CoV RNA which is consistently detected in feces at about two weeks after symptom onset [26, 29] . For the most sensitive detection of endemic HCoVs, upper respiratory specimens should be collected within the first few days of symptom onset. The dynamics of RNA shedding in MERS and SARS patients may reflect the specimen source, severity of illness, as well as underlying risk factors. Among hospitalized patients who did not require ventilator support, MERS-CoV RNA levels in the upper respiratory tract usually peaked in the first week after symptom onset. Among eventual fatal cases requiring ventilation, RNA levels in lower respiratory tract specimens peaked between weeks 2 and 3 [27] . Similar shedding patterns were seen for SARS-CoV: RNA positive rates peaked in upper respiratory tract specimens at 7-10 days after symptom onset and then steadily declined after that, while RNA positive rates in lower respiratory tract specimens remained higher throughout 3 weeks after onset of illness [26] . In one study, diabetes was associated with prolonged MERS-CoV RNA shedding in the respiratory tract [27] . Viral pneumonias typically do not result in the production of purulent sputum. Thus, a nasopharyngeal swab/wash is usually the collection method used to obtain a specimen for testing. Nasopharyngeal specimens may miss early infection; a deeper specimen may need to be obtained by bronchoscopy. Alternatively, repeated testing can be used because over time, the likelihood of the SARS-CoV-2 being present in the nasopharynx increases. Self-collected saliva specimens were tested positive in 11 of 12 COVID-19 patients, suggesting it is a promising non-invasive specimen for diagnosis, monitoring, and infection control in SARS-CoV-2 infections [30] . At the time of writing there was little data on the performance of upper vs. lower respiratory tract specimens for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 [16] . Serum is another source for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. However, only 15% of patients hospitalized with pneumonia had detectable RNA in serum [16] . Specimens collected for laboratory testing of HCoVs should be maintained at refrigerated temperature for up to 72 h, or frozen at \u221270\u00b0C or below (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/ 2019-nCoV/lab/guidelines-clinical-specimens.html.

In a pre-peer reviewed article, Diao et al. reported that a fluorescence immunochromatographic assay is an accurate, rapid, early and simple method for detecting nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 in NP swab for diagnosis of COVID-19 (https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03. 07.20032524v2. Accessed 15 March 2020). The incorporation of colloidal gold-labeled immunoglobulin G (IgG) as the detection reagent is an approach that may increase the sensitivity of rapid antigen tests for respiratory viruses [38] . Monoclonal antibodies specifically against SARS-CoV-2 have been under preparation. Novel approaches to concentrate antigen, or to amplify the detection phase are needed if these methods are to have clinical utility. Sona Nanotech (Halifax, Canada) is developing a quick-response lateral-flow test to screen COVID-19 patients targeting to produce results in 5-15 min (https://sonanano.com/sona-develops-rapidscreening-test-for-coronavirus/.

When SARS-CoV-2 was identified, especially when rapid antigen testing and/or molecular assays are neither available nor stable, serology can be used as a supplementary diagnostic tool. A recent study demonstrated that both IgM and IgG antibodies were detected 5 days after onset in all 39 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The authors recommended to use serology to facilitate the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections when an NP swab specimen was collected inappropriately and the molecular assays were performed unsatisfactorily [42] .

Variable performance has been reported on these devices [47, 58] . In their registration certificates, it was clearly indicated that the certificate was for urgent and supplemental diagnosis of pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2. Additional multi-centre clinical trial data are needed for extension after one year. Among them, one (MGI Tech) uses its NGS technique to detect all pathogens in a given specimen including SARS-CoV-2 and the other one (Innovita) uses its isothermal amplification followed by chip detection. The other nine devices incorporated real-time PCR technique with hydrolysis probes. After nucleic acids get extracted (separated reagents and systems), the extracts are transferred to a real-time PCR thermocycler (e.g. ABI 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR Instrument) for nucleic acid amplification and detection.",

Lysis buffer can be used to inactivate the infectivity of specimens so the testing can be run at POC when a biosafety cabinet is not available. Fast near-patient and POCT could help more efficiently triage of suspected cases of novel coronavirus, helping to focus limited resources on enabling appropriate use of quarantine. A handful of diagnostics developers are now striving to bring fast SARS-CoV-2 tests to market as soon as possible, with hopes of ultimately assisting with the ongoing outbreak in China. Molecular diagnostic tests for use at the are in development from Cepheid and HiberGene (Dublin, Ireland). Cepheid has some advantages in the molecular POCT space because it already has instruments placed in China. Mobidiag, meanwhile, may offer additional benefits with a multiplex test for coronavirus and Flu viruses (https://www. genomeweb.com/pcr/diagnostics-firms-rush-developrapid-point-care-tests-novel-coronavirus#.XkeA3SgzY 2x.
