WHO/CDS/CSR/EPH/2002.16). Just as inadequate surveillance and laboratory capacity work to the advantage of infectious diseases, strong public health systems can be viewed as a national security asset (Fidler, 2002) . It is therefore in the interest of both industrialized and developing countries to strengthen public health systems in developing countries. Strengthened laboratories, welltrained health personnel, and reinvigorated public health institutions benefit developing countries by ensuring early identification and containment of outbreaks, thereby decreasing the suffering, death, and economic impact they cause. At the same time, industrialized countries benefit from the decreasing risk that these diseases will spread internationally (Document no. WHO/CDS/CSR/EPH/2002.16; Kelley, 2000; Chyba, 2002; Kassalow, 2001) . These arguments have acquired much more compelling force in light of developments including the international spread of infectious diseases such as AIDS in the early 1980s and SARS in 2003: Early detection and containment of infectious disease outbreaks can prevent their international spread and their potential to cause major emergencies (www.who.int/ whr/2003/chapter5/en/).",

A series of international health agreements between the newly industrialized countries, elaborated during the 19 th century, culminated in the adoption of the International Health Regulations in 1969 (International health organizations, 1969). These regulations are designed to maximize security against the international spread of infectious diseases while ensuring minimum impact on trade and travel. Administered by WHO, these are the only international regulations that require reporting of infectious diseases. Three diseases-cholera, plague and yellow fever-are targeted by the Regulations for reporting by countries. They also provide norms and standards for air and sea ports designed to prevent the spread from public conveyances of rodents or insects that may be carrying infectious diseases, and describe best practices to be used to control the spread of these diseases once they have occurred.",

While all these outbreaks caused concern throughout the world, with serious economic consequences and disruptions in travel and trade, it was the highly publicized Ebola outbreak that pointed most urgently to the need for changes in the International Health Regulations. That outbreak, which caught the international community by surprise, signaled the need for stronger infectious disease surveillance and control worldwide, for improved international preparedness to provide support when similar outbreaks occur, and for accommodating the needs of the media in providing valid information. A need for more broad-based international health regulations and electronic information systems connecting WHO with its regional and country offices also became evident, as did the realization that timely and adequate outbreak detection and response would need support from a broad coalition of partners (Heymann, Barakamfitiye, Szezeniowski, et al. 1999) .",

The alert also referred to two other events that raised the level of alarm: an outbreak of 305 cases, with 5 deaths, of atypical pneumonia reported in mid-February from the southern Chinese province of Guangdong, and an almost simultaneous report from Hong Kong of two confirmed cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) in family members with a recent travel history to southern China.

A new and potentially pandemic strain of the influenza virus was the first and most greatly feared suspected cause. Laboratories in the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Network had been on alert since late November 2002, when the Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN) picked up rumours of severe \"flu-like\" outbreaks in Guangdong and Beijing (SARS-chronology of events, 2003) . Studies conducted by Chinese scientists and confirmed by a network of influenza laboratories identified strains of influenza B virus as the cause, and concern eased. It mounted to new heights with the mid-February 2003 confirmation of avian influenza in Hong Kong, prompting WHO to activate its influenza pandemic preparedness plans (Influenza A(H5N1), 2003) . To learn more about the outbreak in Guangdong, a team of experts, drawn from the WHO Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, arrived in Beijing on 23 February, but was not granted permission to travel further. A second GOARN team began an emergency investigation in Hanoi on 28 February, two days after the first case of atypical pneumonia was admitted to hospital, and established infection control procedures and an isolation ward. Laboratories in the influenza network analysed specimens from this patient and other early cases, and conclusively ruled out influenza viruses as the cause. They also ruled out all other known causes of respiratory illness. With a new disease increasingly suspected, WHO began daily teleconferences linking its country and regional offices and response teams with headquarters operational staff. These mechanisms, too, proved to be decisive in tracking the outbreak, gathering the knowledge for recommending effective control measures, and getting support teams to countries requesting assistance.",

The disease did not respond to antibiotics and antivirals known to be effective against primary atypical pneumonia and other respiratory infections. No patients, including young and previously healthy health workers, had recovered, many were in critical condition, several required mechanical ventilatory support, and four had died. Equally alarming, the disease was rapidly spreading along the routes of international air travel. The potential for further international spread was vividly demonstrated that same day when a medical doctor, who had treated the first cases of atypical pneumonia in Singapore, reported similar symptoms shortly before boarding a flight from New York to Singapore. The airline was alerted and the doctor and his wife disembarked in Frankfurt for immediate hospitalization, becoming the first cases in Europe (SARS: lessons from a new disease, 2003). Faced with these events, WHO issued a second and stronger global alert on 15 March, this time in the form of an emergency travel advisory (www.who.int/csr/ sars/archive/2003 03 15/en/). The alert provided guidance for travellers, airlines and crew, set out a case definition, and gave the new disease its name: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). It also launched a coordinated global outbreak response that tested a critical assumption: rapid and intense public health action could stop a new transmissible disease, of unidentified cause and unknown epidemic potential, from becoming endemic.",

As the outbreak evolved, some of the world' s most experienced laboratory experts, clinicians, and epidemiologists worked together in virtual networks, taking advantage of up-to-date communication technologies, including the internet, secure websites, and video and telephone conferencing. Laboratories in the existing influenza surveillance network formed the basis for a new virtual network to identify the causative agent, which was achieved within a month, and to develop diagnostic tests (WHO Multicentre Collaborative Network for SARS, 2003) . Clinicians and field epidemiologists constituted other virtual networks, and by the end of the outbreak more than 150 experts from institutions in 17 countries had demonstrated how close collaboration and sharing of information, despite strong academic pressure to publish information in scientific journals, could serve the public health good. No estimates are available for the number of health staff who risked their lives in caring for patients, though the deaths of many have been documented.",

As real-time evidence accumulated, further international spread was attributed to persons with SARS who continued to travel internationally by air, in some cases infecting passengers and crew during the flight (www.who.int/csr/ sars/en/WHOconsensus.pdf). Daily tracking of cases also revealed that contacts of SARS patients continued to travel, becoming ill upon arrival at their destination. On 27 March, WHO therefore issued recommendations that countries with major outbreaks screen departing passengers for fever and other signs of SARS, or known contact with SARS patients (www.who.int/csr/sars/archive/2003 03 27/ en/print.html). The choice of measures for putting this recommendation into effect was left to the discretion of individual countries. Some set up screening measures at international airports and border crossings with a variety of requirements, including a health declaration by each departing passenger, temperature monitoring of each passenger, and a stop list of contacts of SARS patients at immigration by which known contacts were asked not to travel.",

Real time information further demonstrated that contact tracing at some sites did not fully identify chains of transmission, and that transmission was occurring outside confined settings such as the health care environment, possibly placing the general population at risk. In late March, an outbreak of 329 almost simultaneous probable cases among residents of a housing estate in Hong Kong suggested possible transmission by exposure to some factor in the environment, thus creating further opportunities for exposure in the general population (www.sars-expertcom.gov.hk/english/reports/reports.html). Additional evidence-based guidance was therefore made for the sites where contact tracing could not link all cases, understanding that if the disease were spreading in the wider community it would greatly increase the risk to travellers and the likelihood that cases would be exported to other countries. This guidance was aimed at international travellers, and recommended that they postpone all but essential travel to designated sites in order to minimize their risk of becoming infected (www.who.int/csr/don/2003 07 01/en/). Thus an important surgical congress scheduled for the summer of 2003 to be held in Bangkok, Thailand, was postponed.",

Likewise, the travel recommendations issued by WHO appear to have been effective in helping to contain international spread of SARS. Of the 40 international flights known to have carried 37 probable SARS cases, current analysis has implicated five in transmission to passengers or crew (www.who.int/csr/sars/en/WHOconsensus.pdf). Following the 27 March recommendations for exit screening, no confirmed SARS case associated with in-flight exposure was reported to WHO. This may have been because awareness of screening procedures discouraged persons with fever from attempting to travel (Olsen, Chang, Cheung, et al. 2003) .",

Travel recommendations also appear to have provided a benchmark for gauging the safety of international travel; when an area was declared safe from the risk of SARS transmission, traveller confidence was regained. Recommendations concerning travel were ended when epidemiological criteria indicating a low risk to travellers were met. That goal in itself became a motivation for governments and populations to collaborate in bringing the outbreaks under control. Many countries also set a second goal of removal from the list of areas with recent local transmission. The determination to attain this objective may have contributed to the speed with which the cycle of human-to-human transmission was broken globally, and confidence was restored (www.who.int/gb/ EB WHA/PDF/EB113/eeb11333.pdf). Passenger movement figures provided by the Hong Kong International Airport show a rapid rebound from the lowest number of passengers, 14,670, recorded just before 23 May when the travel recommendations for Hong Kong were removed, to 54,195 on 12 July, a month and a half later (Hong Kong International Airport, personal communication).",
