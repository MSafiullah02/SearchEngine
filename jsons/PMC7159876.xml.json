In this phase, the CoViD+ patients with traumatology or surgical urgent issues were hospitalized in single rooms in these hybrid departments, with dedicated healthcare workers and without the possibility to receive external visitors. During interdepartmental referrals for inpatients who required Orthopaedic consultations, whether in the emergency department, inpatient facilities, or in isolated wards, all personnel was instructed to wear full personal protective equipment (PPE) and was taught to remove it safely. All patients with debilitating pain deriving from Orthopaedic degenerative disease were managed with conservative treatments for pain relief, yet inviting patients to go to the hospital only for unbearable pain. The clinical follow-up of operated or ER discharged patients was ensured, changing the method for the Orthopaedic surgeon to examine and deal with the patient. People with SARS-CoV2 infection, as described in literature, belong to all age groups; outpatients couldn't be screened for coronavirus, therefore all patients had to be treated as infected, even if young and apparently healthy [5,6].",
