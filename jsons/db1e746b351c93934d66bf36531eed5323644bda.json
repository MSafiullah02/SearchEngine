The control unit is connected to the computer using USB interface to send data to the computer to display the individual patient parameters and graphs using the in-house built graphical user-interface using processing application. Both the flow and pressure sensors were calibrated using the mother ventilator while connected to two lung simulators of varying compliance (Figure-2) . The calibration process is beyond the scope of this article, can be reported in a separate manuscript. All the conversion and calculation were done in the microcontroller and graphical user-interface (GUI) was used to provide an interactive but familiar interface to the respiratory therapists. Since the flow sensor is a bi-directional sensor, it can provide real-time inspiratory and expiratory flow directly in L/Min unit. This was directly used to show the real-time flow measurement in the GUI, however, the tidal, inspiratory and expiratory volume were calculated from the flow data in the microcontroller using the time of inspiration and expiration. On the other hand, the pressure sensor measures the pressure in the expiratory tube with respect to the air pressure and provides analogue voltage output according to the ",

Although both the lungs were of similar compliance one lung was getting tidal volume of ~400 mL, while other is getting ~360 mL. This discrepancy is due to the imperfect circuitry of the prototype where the two limbs had slightly different lengths and ensuing dead space.

Therefore, patients generally do not require high PEEP, but high minute ventilation and oxygen supplementation. Non-invasive ventilation and high flow oxygen use in COVID-19 is discouraged, as they are high aerosol generating procedures and high infection risk for staff. Simple ventilatory modes may be adequate in these patients to provide oxygen support and therefore multiple-patient-single-ventilator may be a feasible strategy.",

The ventilator would be set to deliver the total required cumulative volume for both the connected patients. The inflow to the patient requiring less TV would be brought to the required level by the flow control valve of that patient, leaving the other patient to receive the larger proportion of TV. The ventilator would be set to deliver the lower of the two PEEP levels of the attached patient. If one patient's need higher PEEP, it would be increased to the required level by the PEEP control valve, leaving the other patient with the lower baseline PEEP. The display of individual patients' real-time ventilatory data, graphic and numerical, is exactly in the format used by the standard ventilators (Figure-3) hence no new training needs to be given to the nurses, doctors and respiratory therapists.",
