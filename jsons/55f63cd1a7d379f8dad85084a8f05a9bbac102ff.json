However, the role of atypical bacteria is uncertain in HIV-infected patients with CAP [1] , partly due to the limitations of serological diagnosis in immunocompromised patients. A Kenyan study of inpatients with CAP found Mycoplasma pneumoniae in 2.7% of HIV-infected patients, and detected no cases of Legionella or Chlamydia [7] . By contrast, a South African study of inpatients with CAP (81.4% of whom were HIV seropositive) found M. pneumoniae in 17%, Chlamydia pneumoniae in 4.9%, and Legionella pneumophila in 0.9% [8] ; the high prevalence of M. pneumoniae they reported could be explained if the study was done during an epidemic, which is likely as cyclical epidemics are a feature of M. pneumoniae epidemiology. We found that atypical bacteria were uncommon in seriously ill HIV-infected inpatients in our study using a molecular approach, which offers rapid diagnosis of atypical bacteria and should not be affected by immunostatus, unlike serology. South African surveys of inpatients (more than half of whom were HIV-infected) with severe respiratory illness found that M. pneumoniae was detected in 73 of 4703 (1.9%), which was not related to HIV status, C. pneumoniae in 11 of 2793 (0.4%), and Legionella species in 21 of 1805 (1.2%) using molecular approaches [19] [20] [21] , supporting our finding that atypical bacteria are uncommon causes of respiratory infection in HIV-infected inpatients. Our study has several limitations. First, we are unable to distinguish viral colonization from infection as there are no accepted quantitative PCR cutoffs for diagnosing respiratory virus infections. We are also unable to distinguish between viral upper and lower respiratory tract infections. Second, the cutoff we used for bacterial infection is derived from studies using quantitative culture but has not been well validated for all bacterial pathogens [12] , and has not been validated in HIV-infected patients with CAP, PJP, or TB. Third, the quantitative real-time PCR cutoff for P. jirovecii that we used as the reference standard for PJP was based on 2 studies that reported cutoffs of 1900 copies/mL [13] and 1300 copies/mL [14] to distinguish between colonization and infection. Because there is currently no accepted cutoff [22] , we arbitrarily used 1000 copies/mL, which was within 0.3 log 10 copies/mL of the cutoffs of the other 2 studies (the lowest value in participants meeting our case definition was 1858 copies/mL). However, a meta-analysis found that real-time PCR has a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 93% for the diagnosis of PJP in HIV-infected patients [22] , indicating that this test is a reasonable reference standard. Fourth, our findings were in inpatients with WHO danger signs and cough, in a population with a high prevalence of TB, and with a high proportion requiring sputum induction; therefore, our findings may not be generalizable to other populations of HIV-infected patients. Sputum induction is a low-cost intervention that could be widely implemented in resource-limited settings to facilitate identification of respiratory pathogens, including M. tuberculosis.
