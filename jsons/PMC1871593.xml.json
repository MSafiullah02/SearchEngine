Identification of these risk factors may be useful for efforts to interrupt transmission. A multitude of studies have identified various risk factors for ARTI. Studies in developing countries have identified risk factors to be among others crowding, nutritional factors, and parental smoking [12-15]. Because of major differences in living conditions and environmental circumstances these study outcomes can not directly be extrapolated to industrialised countries. Studies in industrialised countries can roughly be divided into studies addressing children, and studies addressing specific respiratory diseases. Known risk factors for children are for instance young age [16], environmental tobacco smoke [17,18], home-dampness [19,20], and attending day-care centres [19,21,22]. Risk factors noted in relation with specific respiratory diseases, like asthma, COPD and tuberculosis, are active smoking, low socio-economic status, occupational exposure and exposure to air pollution [23-28].",

Only exposure outside the household appears to be a risk factor for a laboratory-confirmed ARTI.

Smoking is believed to exacerbate respiratory diseases by harming respiratory defence mechanisms [33].  Nevertheless, in this study smoking or exposure to passive smoking was not a risk factor for consulting a GP with an ARTI nor for consulting with a laboratory-confirmed ARTI. It is possible that, selection bias is part of the explanation for this finding. Smokers might be less inclined to visit a GP with respiratory complaints as compared with non-smokers. Moreover, our findings are based on questionnaire-data about exposure, which are often prone to recall bias. Questionnaires are relatively cheap and easily used, but are likely to be less valid and reliable then the measurement of biomarkers in body fluids for true exposure [34]. Furthermore, awareness of the adverse health effects of passive smoking has increased substantially in the past years because of extensive information. This might have resulted in lower exposure levels, explaining the lack of association with ARTI in the general population. A recent study in school children also concluded that smoking by a care-provider was not significantly associated with respiratory infections [20].",

Secondly, questionnaire data were used to measure exposure to potential risk factors. This could be less reliable compared with observational data. Moreover, heightened attention to the cause of their complaints by patients with an ARTI may have caused recall bias. Thirdly, we cannot rule out the possibility that controls were in the incubation period for an ARTI, even though they had no respiratory complaints. We expect the number of controls developing those infections to be low, because the GP's actively asked for the presence of respiratory symptoms at the moment the nose and throat swabs were taken.
