            "text": "Background: To determine the concordance in the Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) scores between child self-reports and parent-proxy reports in children on maintenance chemotherapy and those who have completed chemotherapy. Methodology: Seventy seven children with leukaemia were consecutively enrolled, of which 22 were on maintenance chemotherapy and the rest had completed treatment. HRQOL scores were assessed using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL TM ) Generic Core Scales Ver. 4.0, which yielded total, physical and psychosocial health summary scores as well as domain scores in emotion, school and social functioning. Concordance between child and parent ratings on each of the PedsQL subscales and total scores were judged according to guidelines established by Cohen & Holliday. Results: Concordance was good between child self-report and parent-proxy report for children on maintenance chemotherapy (r=0.583-0.770) except for the school (r=0.229) and social domain (r=0.248). For children who had completed chemotherapy, there was only moderate concordance between child and parent in the domains of school, physical health scores, psychosocial health scores and total scores (r=0.414-0.494) whereas emotion domain showed strong concordance (r=0.589) and poor concordance in social domain (r=0.116). Conclusion: In general, the strong concordance in the chemotherapy group showed that Malaysian parents are perceptive to their children's needs and problems. This perception wanes somewhat when their children have completed chemotherapy as evidenced by poorer concordance in the maintenance chemotherapy group.",

            "text": "Background: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a common malignancy in children. The etiology of acute pancreatitis (AP) in ALL children receiving chemotherapy is unknown but has often been reported associated with L-asparaginase therapy. Objectives: To determine the incidence, risk factors, clinical data, outcome and mortality of AP in ALL children. Patients and Methods: Retrospective cohort study was conducted by reviewing the data of total 192 pediatric ALL patients from Pediatric Oncology Registry at Ramathibodi Hospital from 2000 to 2006 to assess incidence, clinical data, outcome and mortality of AP. Then, we conducted a nested case-control study to identify potential risk factors for AP by recruiting all AP patients as cases (n=16), and randomly selected patients without AP to serve as controls up to four controls per case with the total of 68 controls. Results: The incidence of AP in ALL children in this study was 8.3%. Seven of the 16 patients with AP (43.8%) died. The mortality rate of AP group was significantly higher than the group of patients without AP (43.8% VS 19.3%, p =0.02). Having AP and receiving standard/high risk chemotherapy protocol were associated with high mortality, with the hazard ratio of 5.1 (95%CI 2.2, 12), and 2.8 (95%CI 1.4, 5.8), respectively. Multivariate analysis identified the high risk chemotherapy protocol was the only risk factor for AP. Conclusion: High risk chemotherapy protocol is a risk factor for pancreatitis in ALL patients. Factors associated with high mortality in ALL children were having pancreatitis and receiving standard/high risk chemotherapy protocol. , 343 childhood brain tumors were diagnosed. Astrocytoma accounted for 117/343(34%) which is lower than the 49.6% of the USA data (SEER75-95). The relative frequency of each WHO subtypes were: Gr1 n=35, Gr2 n=11, Gr3 n=7, Gr4 n=15, brainstem n=44, spinal n=5. It was more common in boy (M:F=75:42) and the median age was 8.75yrs (range 0.25 ~ 17.73yrs). It was younger among low grade (median 5.42 yrs) as compared to high grade (median 12.81yrs). Except for brainstem, the commonest locations were cerebellum for Gr1 and cerebral for Gr2,3&4. Gr1&2 were treated mainly by surgery. Gr3&4 were mostly treated with surgery, chemotherapy & RT. The 5-yrs overall survival for Gr1,2,3,4 & brainstem were 96.4%, 100%, 0%, 0%, 5.4% respectively. Almost all with Gr3&4 died within 2 yrs. Conclusions: Astrocytoma is the commonest form of brain tumor in Chinese children but its relative frequency is less than that of Western countries. Low grade astrocytoma has excellent survival but high grade astocytoma remains incurable in most patients irrespective of the treatment modalities given.",

We evaluate the role of Ca on production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) from polymorphonuclear leulocytes (PMN). Methods: Using flow cytometry, we compared the ROS and NO production from PMNs after the stimulation by S. aureus or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) (25 \u00b5g/ml). PMNs taken from the 3 groups of mice were analyzed: C57BL/6 wild type mice (Group C), low Ca diet fed for 2 weeks mice (Group Low Ca), and low magnesium (Mg) diet fed for 2 weeks (Group Low Mg).",

Although distinct genetic mechanisms are implicated in their pathogenesis, little has been known about those genetic changes that characterize these distinctive histology types, except for common PAX3 and PAX7 rearrangements in alveolar types. [Methods] In order to investigate the genetic changes that underlie the pathogenesis of both alveolar and embryonal RMSs, we performed comprehensive analysis of copy number alterations in RMS genomes obtained from a total of 30 RMS samples including RMSderived cell lines using high-density SNP-genotyping microarrays (Affymetirx GeneChip 100K/500K arrays).",

            "text": "Introduction: Recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) has been first used for controlling massive bleeding in patients with DHF in Thailand since 1997. Methods: Thirty-eight patients (17 males, 21 females) with DHF grade II (n=4), III (n=19) and IV (n=15) who received rFVIIa between July 1997 to June 2007 were retrospectively studied. They were admitted at Ramathibodi Hospital (n=17) and other hospitals (n=21). Their median age was 9.0 years. The patients were divided into two groups: group 1 included 23 patients waiting for platelet concentrate and group 2 included 15 patients who had already received platelet concentrate with unresponsiveness. The dose of rFVIIa was 100 \u00b5g/kg at 15-30 min interval for 1-4 doses until the bleeding significantly reduced followed by 2-4 h interval until the bleeding was completely ceased. Results: Each patient exhibited bleeding at 2-5 sites including gastrointestinal tract 48.0%, epistaxis 16.4%, oral cavity 11.0%, hemothorax 8.2%, lungs 4.1%, hypermenorrhea 4.1%, hematuria 2.7% and other sites 5.5%. An effective response was found in 25 patients (65.8%), including 18 patients in group 1 and seven patients in group 2. The case-fatality rate in this study was 23.6% (9/38) found in group 2 only. They were in the condition of prolonged shock for more than 24-48 h before receiving rFVIIa. Conclusion: The use of rFVIIa, a life-saving medicine, is effective in restoring hemostasis to control massive bleeding in patients with DHF. De La Salle University Medical Center All throughout the year, dengue fever has always been present in pediatric census in different hospitals in our country. It still has been a health problem. However, supportive treatment has always been the conventional management in dengue. For some pediatricians, the incorporation of Carbazochrome sodium sulfonate or Adenogen has been part of their management in dengue cases. But there are no studies yet to prove the efficacy of it in dengue. This is a descriptive study of pediatric dengue patients admitted at De La Salle University-Medical Center from January-December 2004 given and not given Adenogen. There were 249 pediatric patients diagnosed with dengue fever/dengue hemorrhagic fever admitted. Nineteen had other concomitant illness, thus were excluded in the study. A total of 230 pediatric patients were included in the study, and 83 of which were given Adenogen and the rest were subjected to conventional dengue management. For dengue patients given Adenogen, most of them live in Dasmarinas, Cavite and were female aged 6-9 years old. Out of 83 patients, only 7 developed complication (8.4%), all of which had hemoconcentration, and no morbidities or mortalities were noted among them. Compared with the group who were not given Adenogen, 17.0% had complications such as pleural effusion, hemoconcentration, bleeding and mortalities.",

Such a circumstance has enabled us to estimate the vaccine effectiveness (VE) without conducting an expensive study. Methods: Prospective cohort study. All the pupils in 4 primary schools in Tsuchiura city, Ibaraki, Japan were included in the study (n=2607). A questionnaire for baseline survey was sent to the parents in January 2007, which inquired about several risk factors to influenza including vaccination status. When a child was diagnosed as influenza with a rapid test during the winter in 2006/2007, the parent was asked to submit an influenza reporting form to the school administration. Adjusted VE was calculated with a logistic regression model. Results: Vaccination rate was 44.8% in total. Incidence of influenza A and B was 5.2% and 11.7%, respectively. The epidemics began in late February 2007, which was markedly delayed compared to other years. The crude VE for influenza A and B was 20% (95%CI: -11 to 43%) and 2% (-21 to 21%), while adjusted VE for influenza A and B was 52.4% (23.1 to 70.7%) and 6.8% (-34.0 to 35.2%), respectively. Disease history of influenza A in the previous year seemed protective to the development of influenza A in the current season (Odds ratio: 0.27, 0.07 to 1.09). Conclusions: Results of rapid tests could be utilized to assess influenza VE without much cost.",

Eosinophilia has been found in our and other studies in KD. This study has further investigated whether eosinophil related T helper 2 (Th2) cytokines or eosinophil activation mediator (eosinophil cationic protein, ECP) involved in the KD with coronary artery lesions (CAL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 95 KD patients were enrolled for this study. Plasma samples were subjected to measurement of interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-5 and eotaxin by Luminex-Bedalyte multiplex beadmates system and to measurement of ECP by fluoroimmunoassay. CAL was defined as internal diameter greater than 3 mm of coronary artery. RESULTS: Patients with KD had higher C-reactive protein (CRP) and eosinophils than febrile controls. Eosinophil-related mediators: IL-4, IL-5, eotaxin and ECP levels were also higher in KD patients than controls before intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment. After IVIG treatment, ECP levels decreased but IL-4, IL-5, and eotaxin increased significantly. The higher the IL-5 and eosinophil levels after IVIG treatment, the lower rate of CAL was found in KD patients. Changes of eosinophils after IVIG treatment were positively correlated to changes of IL-5 levels but not the ECP levels. CONCLUSIONS: The eosinophilia associated with higher Th2 mediator (IL-5) but not ECP level after IVIG treatment was associated with protection of CAL formation.",

Also we measured blood histamine, tryptase, eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP), leukotrieneB4 (LTB4) and,LTC4,D4,E4 levels during provocation test. (Results) Implicated food was identified in 16 patients. Among these 16 patients, eleven patients had more than two suspected food allergens. RAST for all implicated food demonstrated above class 1 in seven patients, negative in four. SPT turned positive in nine patients, negative in four. Both RAST and SPT were negative in three patients. Provocation test was positive in nine patients, negative in seven. There was no significant increase of tryptase and ECP during the tests. (Conclusion) The diagnosis of FEIAn was made by the elevated plasma histamine levels on provocation test in three patients whose RAST, SPT and the symptoms on provocation test were all negative.

Taiwan Univ., Taipei, Taiwan, 5 Dept. of Ped., China Med. Univ., Taichung, Taiwan BACKGROUND: Down syndrome (DS) is a model of genomic dosage imbalance. The aim is to investigate the transcriptome difference between DS and euploidy from fetal amniotic fluid (AF). The pertubagen pattern means possible treatment for genomic imbalance. METHODS: Amniocytes cultures were collected from fetuses between 16-22 weeks pregnancy. Gene expression was obtained using oligonucleotide chips (22,572 probes). Significant gene expression was analyzed by two-sample t test, Welch's test and Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM), and combination by score and rank function. CMAP-based discretization by up/down tags of genes revealed candidate perturbagens in forms of agonists and antagonists. Pertubargens pattern was plotted by CMAP score versus ATC code (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification), calculated permutation p values. RESULTS: AF were collected from 6 pregnancies with DS fetuses and 6 with normal. One of the DS was partial trisomy. Among 22,572 gene probes investigated, 29 genes were significantly up-regulated by all three tests. Eighteen (63%) of them were on chromosome 21. In data fusion exercises, we found combination of rank scorings was more effective than any single. Using discretization by CMAP, there were 158 agonists and 63 antagonists as candidate pertubagens. Among agonists, ATC-L (immunosuppressive agents) was the most frequent occurrence and two were significant by p value. Among antagonists, ATC-A (oral glucose lowering drugs) were the most frequent, but none was significant. CONCLUSIONS: Our microarray analysis determined expressions of 29 genes potentially important in DS and found immunosuppressive as significant agonist for DS in developing fetus. It is necessary for further study.",

Design: A one-year study: determining the growth rate and the lipid metabolism under GH treatment. Patients: Eighty-three children (61 boys and 22 girls) with the GH deficiency were treated with GH for one year after the diagnosis. Intervention: The patients were treated with recombinant human GH (0.19 mg/kg/week) for at least one year after the diagnosis.

The four types of SNPs in the GHR gene, Cys440Phe, Pro495Thr, Leu544Ile and Pro579Thr, and exon 3 deletion polymorphisms were genotyped by direct-sequencing and multiplex PCR. Results: We found no significant association between the GHR polymorphisms and changes in the height SDSs during GH treatment. The total cholesterol levels of the GH deficient boys with Ile/Ile at codon 544 showed significantly higher cholesterol levels before GH treatment and then maintained those the high levels during the GH treatment than those with other genotypes.

The ductusdilating effect of a Rho-Kinase inhibitor, fasudil, was studied by intraperitoneal injection at 60 min after birth, and the diameter was studied 30 and 60 min later. The differential effect of fasudil on the near-term were studied by orogastric administration of indomethacin (10 mg/kg) and fasudil into pregnant rats and studying the fetal ductus 4 h later.",

Therefore, assessment of the vasodilator capacity is important. Whether aerosolized iloprost could be used for the vasoreactivity testing in children with a longstanding PH from CHD is needed to determine. Methods: Children with PH from CHD underwent for hemodynamic evaluation and vasoreactivity testing using iloprost 0.5 mcg/kg delivered through jet nebulizer.

Life after transplantation include intensive and regular invasive and non-invasive monitoring to preempt acute rejection and the development of transplant coronary artery disease and post transplant lymphoproliferative disease. Compliance is an ongoing challenge in the adolescents. It is generally accepted that mild rejection (ISHLT grade 1R or 1A, 1B & 2) do not require treatment. However, grade 1B was more likely than 1A or 2 to degenerate to moderate 3A rejection. Over the past decade, 57 children (age 0.5-16. 4 years) has been transplanted at Alberta Provincial Pediatric Heart Transplant Program. There were 3 late deaths (compliance n=2, chest infection n=1) and 3 early deaths (high PRAs n=1, multi-organ failure n=2). One teen had a late moderate rejection related to compliance and treated successfully. Excluding the noncompliant patients and early deaths, all remaining patients were monitored with 3-4 biopsies in the first year and annually thereafter if rejection free. All mild rejections (1A & 1B) were \"treated\" by increasing the immusuppression, balancing the dose against renal function, and re-biopsied monthly until rejection free (ISHLT grade 0). Immunosuppression consists of ATGAM for induction, triple therapy (tacrolimus, mycophenolate, prednisone) for 9-12 months. Steroid wean starts at 6 months if rejection free and the patients were usually off steroid by 9-12 months. Rejections \u2265 grade 2 has not been observed in the last decade.

It is usually required for an accurate measurement by cardiac catheterization. We assessed the severity of pulmonary artery hypertension in patients with CHD using motions of the interventricular septum <IVS> by M-mode echocardiography. Method: We performed echocardiography on 46 patients <2 months to 20 years old> with CHD include in complex CHD. Cardiac catheterization was performed within 1 day of the echocardiography study in all cases. All patients were divided into 2 types by IVS motion evaluated using M-mode echocardiograph: type A marked anterior motion in early systole; type B marked posterior motion in early diastole. Right ventricular (RV) volume overload affects the left ventricular (LV) function in patients after tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) repair. However, the impact of RV dilation on regional LV wall motions was unclear. In this study, we determined the relationships of RV size as derived from cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) with the global and regional LV wall motion. Methods: Echocardiogram was performed on 25 postoperative TOF patients aged 17.8\u00b14.4 years and data were compared with 23 age-matched controls. The longitudinal, radial and circumferential components of LV wall motion were analysed using speckle tracking method. CMR-derived parameters of all TOF patients were used for correlation analysis. Results: When compared with controls, TOF patients had reduced global LV longitudinal strain (p=0.003) and SR (p=0.001), and global LV radial strain (p=0.001). Reduced global LV radial strain was contributed by lower strain in inferior, lateral, posterior, and anterior segments (all p<0.05). TOF patients had lower circumferential strain of LV inferior-septal (p<0.001) and inferior (p=0.001) segments. In TOF patients, global LV circumferential strain and SR correlated negatively with indexed RV end-diastolic volume (r=-0.61, p=0.002 and r=-0.45, p=0.03 respectively) and indexed RV end-systolic volume (r=-0.61, p=0.002 and r=-0.53, p=0.009 respectively). LV ejection fraction decreased with indexed RV end-diastolic (r=-0.67, p=0.002) and end-systolic volumes (r=-0.73, p<0.001), and increased with global LV circumferential SR (r=0.58, p=0.015).",

Methods: Twenty-six patients, aged 21.0\u00b13.6 years at 19.9\u00b13.2 years after atrial switch operation, and 27 age-matched controls were studied. Two-dimensional imaging at the 4 chamber view was obtained with tracing of the entire RV endocardial border.

However, large scale application of this new imaging tool to the patients with PA and VSD had never been reported before. Objective: In a tertiary medical center, 11-year experience of MDCT in PA with VSD will be reviewed with focus on the pulmonary artery morphology and trachea stenosis. Methods: Between 1995 and 2005, 110 patients with PA and VSD visited our hospital. 211 times of MDCT were conducted in 103 of them. Those who received operation three months before or after their MDCT examinations were enrolled. Four patterns of pulmonary artery morphology were defined: native main pulmonary trunk present (group I); confluent central pulmonary arteries without trunk (group II); nonconfluent central pulmonary arteries (group III); absent intrapericardial pulmonary arteries (group IV). Results of pulmonary artery morphology from MDCT were compared with the operation findings. Existence of trachea stenosis was also evaluated. Results: Data of 95 times of MDCT (74 patients) with concurrent operations were collected. Based on the surgical findings, distribution of each group is: 53 (group I, 55.8%), 25 (group II, 26.3%), 12 (group III, 12.6%), 5 (group IV, 5.2%). The overall accuracy for MDCT was 91.6% (87/95). The group specific accuracy was between 88.7% and 100%. In addition, trachea stenosis was detected in 8 patients (10.8%). Conclusion: For PA with VSD, MDCT is a useful tool to define pulmonary artery morphology and possible trachea stenosis, both of which will influence the surgical outcome.",

Volumetric study of the brain using three dimensional magnetic resonance imaging in infants with CHD can help to identify effects on anatomical development of the brain that may be associated with functional impairment. Methods and Results: Thirty-nine infants with CHD were studied prospectively with brain 3D-MRI several months after heart surgery, and compared to nineteen healthy control infants. Neurodevelopmental assessment was performed using Bayley II infants developmental scales. The global volume of grey matter was significantly reduced in the patients with CHD compared to normal control (P<0.001) while no significant difference of the volume of white matter was observed. Further, decrease of GM volume was more apparent in frontal lobe than that in temporal lobe. Multivariate analysis revealed that preoperative hypoxia is strongly associated with decreased frontal GM volume (P=0.007). Further, hypoxic patients have a trend toward smaller regional brain volumes, most prominently in frontal GM (P=0.017), as well as more delayed psychomotor development (P=0.05) than non-hypoxic patients. Of note, frontal GM volume was positively associated with psychomotor developmental index PDI score (P=0.005) , but not with mental developmental index. Data, such as students' demographics were obtained. Initial developmental quotients and comparing with the developmental quotients at least 6 months after therapy of both groups were gathered. The type of scheduling in which the students were enrolled was done to see if their DQ in the subsequent evaluation were significantly higher than the initial. Improvement is defined by a child's step up in their level of functionality. Those who obtained the same or lower level were labeled as no improvement. Results: Out of 37 autistic children enrolled in DLSU-NDC, only 30 students were included in the study. Fourteen of them received once-a-week therapy session (Group 1), while the rest receive more than once-a-week therapy (Group 2). Twelve of the students in Group 1 gained a higher DQ, but only 5 of them improved to the next level of functionality. Eleven students in Group 2 had increments in their DQs but only half of them stepped up from their initial functional level. Seventy-seven percent (77%) of subjects improved Personal and Social Area, followed by the Performance area of Development (73%). In Group 1, the average difference between the initial DQ and the subsequent DQ is with marginal significance. While in Group 2, their average difference is statistically significant. Conclusion: The frequency of therapy session is not associated with the development or deterioration of their Develepmental Quotients(DQs). Most of the autistic children receiving intervention improved in their performance and personal and social areas, which then helped them to make the most productive use in their advancement in mental skills.",

To identify whether Toll-like receptor (TLR) and related genes (TLR3, TLR7, TLR9, and UNC93B1) contribute to the development of FS, we performed a case-control study using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Methods;We genotyped the six SNPs in four genes based from the data of the International HapMap Project in 249 FS patients (186 simple and 63 complex) and 225 control subjects. Genotyping was performed with TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay. The Haploview was used to construct haplotypes. Results were analyzed using chi-square tests. Results;The frequency of G allele at rs308328 (UNC93B1, intron7) was significantly higher in FS patients than control subjects (p=0.02). In subgroup analysis, the genotype distributions were significantly different between complex FS, but not simple FS, and controls (corrected p=0.039). No associations were detected between SNPs in TLR3, TLR7, TLR9 and FS susceptibility. Conclusion;The present study suggested that UNC93B1 gene contributed to a genetic susceptibility to development of FS, especially complex FS. UNC93B1 interacts with TLR3, TLR7 and TLR9.

Peak velocity (PV) was measured in the transverse plane at two points in the left renal vein (LRV), one at the hilar portion of the LRV, and the other at the aortomesenteric portion. Anthropometric measurement of height, weight, body surface area (BSA), and body mass index (BMI) were made at the time of ultrasound. Results: They were divided into two groups according to the PV ratios of the LRV: nutcracker group (PV ratio > 4.1, n=72) and non-nutcracker group (PV ratio < 4.1, n=144). There were no differences in the mean age, gender, weight and BSA between the two groups. However, height was significantly higher in nutcracker group than non-nutcracker group (p=0.031), and BMI was significantly lower in nutcracker group than in non-nutcracker group (p=0.006). Furthermore, the PV ratios of the LRV in 216 children with hematuria inversely correlated with BMI (PV ratio = 6.936 -0.17 X BMI, r = -0.188, p=0.006). This inverse correlation was also observed when we selected 113 male patients (r = -0.267, p = 0.004), but not in 103 females (p = 0.478).

Without this improvement in nutrition, the Millennium Development Goals cannot be achieved. Nearly a third of the children in the developing countries are malnourished. About 60% of the deaths in children are associated with malnutrition. There is enough evidence linking nutrition and good maternal and child health (MCH) outcomes; however, nutrition has been poorly integrated with MCH programs in most countries. The Mainstreaming Nutrition Initiative, formed with support from the World Bank, aims to converge the nutrition agenda in selected countries with the MCH agendas towards the achievement of MDGs. This is based on emerging international consensus that convergence of nutrition and MCH is essential. The primary objective of this initiative is to create a partnership between ICDDR,B and global partnerships in health and nutrition to catalyze a convergence of the nutrition and MCH agendas. A conceptual framework for the mainstreaming process as well as tools for assessing the process has been developed. A global review of nutrition has been done with a view to find out evidence for mainstreaming nutrition into MCH programs. The review has contributed substantially to the upcoming Lancet Nutrition Series. Activities related to mainstreaming nutrition have been initiated in several countries including Bangladesh, Viet Nam, Pakistan, Uganda, Ethiopia, Bolivia and Peru. These activities will include assistance in formulating policy on mainstreaming and integration of simple and efficacious nutrition interventions.

Gastric acid outputs (Mmol/h) were quantified during a 1-hr basal period (BAO) and 1-hr stimulated period (SAO) with subcutaneous pentagastrin (6\u00b5g/kg). Hp status was reassessed 60 days after anti-Hp therapy. Results: A significantly greater number of infected children had a very high gastric pH (> 5.5) and demonstrated absolutely no acid output (achlorhydria) in basal state compared to the age matched non-infected group. The acid concentration and volume of gastric secretion were also decreased in infected children. Furthermore, the mean BAO and SAO in Hp-infected children were 50% lower than those with non-infected. However, the eradication therapy in infected children resulted in increase in volume of gastric secretion, lowering of gastric pH, reversal of achlorhydria and significant rise of SAO ( [Methods] Totally 441 HBV carrier children followed-up for more than 15 years were recruited. They were grouped based on their initial HBeAg/anti-HBe status. HBeAg (+) group was further divided into HBeAg (+/+) group (n=152) and HBeAg (+/-) group (n=229) depending on whether spontaneous HBeAg seroconversion occurred during follow-up. Another 25 children with HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were also studied. HLA class I-restricted T cell epitope mutation of HBsAg gene was examined by PCR and direct sequencing at the latest follow-up of these carrier children.",

We studied 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and mitochondrial copy number as potential markers for oxidative stress in BA. [Methods] We focused on the known functional SNPs in the MMP genes (MMP-2 -735C>T, MMP-3 -1612 5A/6A, MMP-9 -1562C>T, MMP-12 -82A>G and MMP-13 -77A>G) and performed the association study between these SNPs and the development of CAL in KD. To confirm the genetic association of the MMP-13 gene to CAL formation in KD, we also evaluated the haplotype frequencies of the MMP-13 gene in the promoter region between the groups. The study population consisted of KD patients with CAL (n=44), without CAL (n=92) and controls (n=175). The genotypings of the polymorphisms were performed by PCR-RFLP and TaqMan \u00ae real-time PCR methods.",

The prevalence rate was reported to be varied in different ethnic groups. Recently, with the remarkable development of the genetic studies, polymorphisms of HLA have been defined by DNA analysis. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of the alleles of HLA to susceptibility and complication of KD in Korean children. Methods: DNA was extracted from children diagnosed with KD (n=74). The polymorphisms of the alleles of HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1 of the KD patients were determined by utilizing the PCR-ARMS and PCR-SSP analysis. The polymorphisms discovered were compared to those of normal healthy controls (n=159). Results: There was a significant increase in the frequencies of alleles of HLA-B35, -B75, -Cw09 in patients with KD when compared to those of the healthy control group. With subgrouping of KD patients into groups with or without a coronary complication, the frequencies of HLA-DRB1*11, were increased in a group with a coronary complication when compared to a healthy control group. In comparison between subgroups with or without a coronary complication, the frequency of HLA-DRB1*09 was only increased in the group with coronary complication. To examine the efficacy of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFO) combined with partial liquid ventilation (PLV) in a rabbit model of acute lung injury. Methods: 17 animals were treated with repetitive saline lavage to achieve a uniform degree of acute lung injury (PaO 2 below 100 mmHg on a FIO 2 of 1.0), and were randomized to either HFO-PLV or CMV-PLV group. 9 animals in HFO-PLV group received intratracheal administration of 5ml/kg perflubron, and were ventilated with HFO for 3 hrs after the dosing period. 8 animals in CMV-PLV group were provided with 5ml/kg perflubron and ventilated with CMV for 3 hrs. The other 5 animals were not lavaged and served as non-lavaged PLV control. They were ventilated with CMV for 3 hrs after the instillation of 5ml/kg perflubron. After the ventilation, lung lavage fluid of each animal was collected and analyzed. Results: Animals in HFO-PLV group had significantly higher mean PaO 2 and lower PaCO 2 values than animals in CMV-PLV group. The proportion of surfactant in large aggregate (LA) forms to total surfactant was significantly higher in animals of HFO-PLV group and non-lavaged PLV control than CMV-PLV group. SA/LA ratio was significantly lower in HFO-PLV group and nonlavaged PLV control respectively compared with CMV-PLV group. Conclusions: HFO had beneficial effects not only on gas exchange but also on the preservation of active forms of endogenous surfactant during PLV. We conclude that HFO is a superior ventilatory method to CMV in applying PLV for clinical practice from the viewpoint of endogenous surfactant activity.",

Objectives: To clarify possible hANP effect to reopen the postnatal ductus arteiriosus (DA), we studied in vivo reopening of the postnatal DA by a recombinant hANP (carperitide) in rats. Methods: Near-term neonatal rats were incubated at 33 degrees Celsius following caesarean section. The DA diameter was measured with a microscope and a micrometer following rapid whole-body freezing. The DA constricted quickly after birth, and the DA diameter was 0.80 and 0.08mm at 0 and 60 min after birth. The ductus-dilating effect of carperitide was studied by subcutaneous injection at 60 min after birth, and the diameter was studied 7, 15, 30 and 60 min later. We investigated the serum hANP concentrations following subcutaneous injection of carperitide. Results: Carperitide dilated the postnatal DA dose-dependently.The DA-dilating effect of Carperitide was maximal at 7 min, and disappeared at 60 min after injection. Carperitide (10 mg/kg) dilated the postnatal constricted DA completely to 0.79 mm. Carperitide (1 mg/kg) dilated the DA to 0.55 mm. The serum hANP levels at 7 minutes after the injection of Carperitide (1mg/kg) was 790 pg/ml. Conclusions: hANP reopens the constricted postnatal DA dose dependently in rats. The increased hANP, accompanying symptomatic premature PDA, may delay closure of the DA. Therefore, cycooxygenase inhibitors should be used before the level of hANP becomes high accompanying symptomatic PDA. There existed disparities among the intercultural couples including paternal age, parental educational level, and residential distribution. The rates of low birthweight and preterm births in the neonates born to foreign-born mothers were lower than those of the counterparts. The adjusted odds ratios of these above outcomes were 0.74 and 0.73, respectively. Early neonatal and neonatal mortalities were lower in the former than the latter. The adjusted hazard ratios of being an early neonatal and neonatal death in babies born to foreign-born mothers were 0.69 and 0.75, respectively. Conclusions: Despite lower levels of parental education, advancing paternal age, and other possible socioeconomic disparity, we demonstrated an epidemiologic paradox of favourable neonatal outcomes among immigrant mothers in Taiwan.",

Because excess bilirubin production can lead to the development of jaundice, use of HO inhibiting drugs, such as metalloporphyrins, may be a promising treatment strategy for the prevention of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. We and others have reported that imidazole dioxolanes also can inhibit in vitro HO activity with selectivity for the inducible HO-1 isozyme and do not affect nitric oxide synthase (NOS) or soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC), in contrast to metalloporphyrins. Therefore, our objective was to investigate the efficacy of the imidazole dioxolane, Azalanstat, towards inhibiting in vivo HO enzyme activity in newborn mice. METHODS: Azalanstat (500 \u00b5mol/kg) or vehicle was administered to 7-dayold FVB mice via intraperitoneal injections. At various times, mice were sacrificed and liver, spleen, and brain harvested. Liver, spleen, and brain HO activities were then quantitated by gas chromatography, calculated as pmoles of carbon monoxide (CO) produced/hr/mg fresh weight, and then expressed as % inhibition of tissue HO activity from treated versus controls. RESULTS: HO activity was maximally inhibited in the spleen (54%) and brain (39%) within 0.5h, and in the liver (28%) at 3h after Azalanstat treatment. Liver HO activity returned to control levels within 24h. In contrast, spleen HO activity increased 18%; while brain HO activity was still inhibited (19%).",

Thus, imidazole dioxolanes may be attractive alternative compounds for use in the treatment of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. There have been many studies on bilirubin levels in normal newborn infants, the definition of \"normal bilirubin level\" has not been established. This is because bilirubin levels change rapidly in the first 72 hours and vary considerably depending on gestational age, racial composition of the population, proportion of breastfed infants, and other genetic and epidemiological factors. However, most studies were carried out on infants with white color skin. In Brunei, the majority of newborn infants are Malay. Hospital stays in Brunei are now short, and measurements of predischarge total serum or TcB (JM-102) are used to determine when additional evaluation is necessary and to predict the risk of subsequent hyperbilirubinemia. In this study, we tried to measure bilirubin levels in normal newborn infants using the new Konica-Minolta transcutaneous jaundice device JM-103. We measured bilirubin levels from 0 to 72 hours after birth in 725 newborn infants (gestational age: >35 weeks) who had been admitted to the well-infant nursery of Raja Isteri Pengiran Anak Saleha (RIPAS) Hospital, Brunei Darussalam. Using a daily list of all deliveries, the nurses obtained JM-103 measurements 3 times every day. All infants in the nursery were eligible for the study. This is the first contemporary study, including the velocity of increase in TcB levels, for neonatal bilirubinemia in a predominately breastfed population. In the future, making nomogram of Brunei Darussalam and combining the use of nomogram and JM-103 will be useful for evaluation of neonatal jaundice, especially in newborn infants of Brunei Darussalam. The mean gestational age and birth weight for study and control groups were 38+3 weeks, 3,143gm and 39+1 weeks, 3,228gm, respectively in phase 1 study. The significant factors for readmission included gestational age, ABO incompatibility, breast feeding, jaundice at discharge, oxytocin, discharge within 72 hrs after birth and meconium stain. The formula to predict the readmission among population of phase 2 had sensitivity and negative predictive values of 87%, 75%; 80%, 74%; and 59%, 76% for 85%, 90% and 95% of readmission, respectively. When readmission rate calculated was <85%, 85-94% and \u226595%, then follow-up in 2 weeks, follow-up in 3 days and held discharge, respectively, were done. Following such CP resulted in decreased readmission from 2.2% to 0.7% (p-value 0.013). 4. Conclusion CP based on readmission rate derived by using an equation developed during this study merits further study to verify its accuracy and safety.",

METHODS: Subjects were 17 patients with KS who were treated with 2 g/kg of IVGG and did not have coronary artery lesion and 9 controls. In Doppler and Tissue Doppler echocardiography, peak aortic velocity (D-AV), peak mitral E and A wave velocity, E/A ratio, aortic ejection time (D-ET), mitral annular peak s', e', and a' velocity, isovolumic contraction time, isovolumic relaxation time (T-IRT), heart rate (HR) were determined. In addition, isovolumic acceleration (IVA) were calculated. Echocardigraphic variables were compared between before and after IVGG as well as patients and controls. RESULT: Mean patients' age was 3.5 years old. Pre-and post-IVGG study were performed at 5.4 and at 11.9 days of illness. In pre-IVGG study, there were significant differences in D (N=28), non-CAL group(N=49), responder group(N=70), and the non-responder group requiring the additional IVIG(N=7). Before and after the initial administration of IVIG, serum IgG levels were measured. Initially IVIG therapy was given with single 2g/kg for 1 day, and then additional IVIG (1g/kg for 1day) was treated if the patients had a sustained fever over the 38.0\u00b0C after 48hr from starting therapy. Results: The level of IgG at postIVIG and its difference between before and after IVIG were significantly different between CAL & non-CAL group. The levels of IgG at before and after IVIG were significantly different between responder and non-responder group. Conclusion: The levels of serum IgG before or after IVIG treatment may have the predictive value of the occurrence of CAL and response of initial IVIG therapy in KD. So, the pharmacodynamic mechanism shifting to shorten the half-life of IgG may be involved in the pathogenesis and outcome of KD.",

This suggests that silent myocardial damage may exist in Kawasaki disease (KD) and recover with IVIG. Purpose: To clarify our hypothesis, we evaluated the myocardial function in patients with KD before and after IVIG by using speckle-tracking and color tissue Doppler echocardiography. Methods: We enrolled 30 children diagnosed as having KD and treated them with high-dose IVIG (2 g/kg/day). Echocardiographic examinations were performed before and at 3-5 days after IVIG therapy. As an index of diastolic function, E/EW was used. Systolic function was evaluated by peak strain values analyzed by EchoPAC and peak systolic values of tissue velocity. Results: Mean values before and after IVIG therapy are given. Radial strain (%) in the anterior LV was 23.2 and 37.6. Longitudinal strain (%) in the free LV wall was 25.0 and 29.2. Longitudinal strain (%) in the free RV wall was 23.2 and 33.5. E/EW in the free LV wall was 16.9 and 14.4. E/EW in the free RV wall was 7.0 and 5.3. BNP (pg/ml) was 88.2 and 28.7. Adrenomedullin (Fmol/ml) was 86.2 and 26.1. Conclusions: Both systolic and diastolic functions were low in the acute phase of KD, but improved immediately after IVIG.

The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) serves as a pattern recognition receptor for a number of endogenous ligands which are potent inducers of inflammation, especially in vasculitis. Soluble RAGE (sRAGE) is supposed to act as a naturally occurring inhibitor of RAGE by neutralizing proinflammatory ligands; S100A12. Objective: The aim of our study was to investigate for the first time circulating sRAGE in with KD and compared these data directly with concentrations of the proinflammatory RAGE-ligand S100A12. Methods: We investigated 50 patients with acute KD, and differentiated by response to intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) treatment, and examined sequential changes in serum levels of RAGE and S100A12 using by ELISA. Results: We found that patients had decreased levels of sRAGE (553\u00b197 pg/ml, P<0.001) during active KD, especially those more severely affected and not responding to treatment. In addition, sRAGE correlated negatively to proinflammatory S100A12 (328 \u00b1 106 ng/ml, P<0.001) which was found elevated in patients with active KD. The initial serum levels of S100A12 were elevated in all patients with KD and decreased within 24 hours of IVIG (P<0.01) in the responders. Conclusions: Our data suggest that endogenously low levels of sRAGE do not only serve as biomarker of inflammation but can also be disease modifying, or even be a susceptibility factor itself. Pharmacologic approaches exploiting the antiinflammatory effects of sRAGE may offer promising therapeutic strategies in the future.",

Subject and Method: Group 1 consists of 15 high risk cases (mean age 13.6 years male/female ratio=8/7) with QT prolongation and with a history of syncope. Group 2 consists of 7 disease controls (mean age 11.1 years, male/female ratio=3/4) with QT prolongation and without syncope. Group 3 consists of 8 controls (mean age 13.1 years, male/female ratio=2/6) without QT prolongation and without syncope. The complex conjugate roots were determined from the characteristic equation of the third order AR model of RR interval from 0 to 5 am. The real part of conjugate root is classified as negative, positive, zero or imaginary root, and is evaluated to discriminate group 1 from the other groups. Results: Absolute negative roots include 13 from group 1 and 2 from group 2. Imaginary roots include 1 from group 1, 1 from group 2, and 5 from group 3. Positive roots include 4 from group 2 and 3 from group 3. Conclusion: As most of the group 1 is characterized a negative root, this position of conjugate root in the complex domain may be useful to predict a risk of syncope and hence a risk of sudden death in LQTS. Sensitivity and specificity of this risk criterion to determine group 1 and 2 were 80% and 40%, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity to determine group 1 and 3 were 82% and 80%, respectively.",

She was noticed to have heart failure due to LVNC at 3-months-old. Despite of full doses of several medications including ACE inhibitor, \u03b2-blocker, and pimobendan, she had often required to admit to our hospital because of progression of heart failure. At 3-years-old, on her 13th hospitalization, a chest X-ray showed marked cardiomegaly (CTR=0.73) and pulmonary congestion. An ECG showed QRS duration of 103ms. An UCG showed diffuse hypokinetic LV wall motion (EF=29.3%) with obvious dyssynchrony between apex, posterior and lateral walls where numerous prominent trabeculations existed, and severe MR. She could not have clinical improvement even with catecholamine infusion, and CRT was considered for her. Biventricular resynchronization using epicardial pacing leads was performed under general anesthesia. Optimal pacing sites were decided to get best synchronization of the ventricular walls on tissue Doppler imaging of echocardiography, and optimal AV delay was adjusted to achieve maximal systolic blood pressure and maximal cardiac output. Over a follow-up period of 6 months, she has exhibited significant and sustained improvement in LV function and clinical symptoms. BNP level decreased from 1960 to 82 pg/mL following initiation of CRT. QRS duration on ECG did not change after successful CRT. We conclude that pediatric CRT provide a highly useful adjunct for the treatment of heart failure even with narrow QRS duration, and may improve the prognosis of patients with LVNC.",

Further investigation on chemotaxis of CB and adult DCs is needed to substantiate this hypothesis. The cause of influenza to the brain was investigated using the A/NWS/33 influenza virus infected BALB/c mouse model. NOS-2 mRNA levels in the infected mouse brain was greater than in control mice in all brain regions examined, particularly in the olfactory bulb and hippocampus on 1 day p.i. On the contrary, no differences in NOS-1 or NOS-3 mRNA levels were found between infected and control mice. There was also a marked increase in the levels of metabolites of nitric oxide in the olfactory bulb and hippocampus. Immunohistochemistry showed positive staining for anti-NOS-2 primarily in the hippocampus of infected mice. Further, anti-NOS-2 and GFAP staining was mostly found around capillary blood vessels of the hippocampus starting early in the course of the disease. These results indicate that the NWS enhances the activation of astrocytes and NOS-2 expression which in turn enhances NO production and the expansion of capillary blood vessels of the brain. Although IE has been reported for more than a decade, a therapy for IE has not yet been defined. We expect that our results will provide evidence which will aid in the development of a novel IE therapy. Conclusion: The incidence of EM-resistant strains is supposed not to be higher in invasive GAS infection. We could find out possible higher incidence of rheumatogenic strains in the invasive GAS infections. It seems to be important to have an effort on studying of serotyping and genotyping for the monitoring of strains and to know the epidemiologic characteristics.",

Methods: The gene expression of cytokines and associated inflammatory molecules in tracheal aspirate fluid (TAF) cells was quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results: Interleukin (IL)-10 and interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 mRNA levels in TAF cells within the first 24 hours of birth, were higher in the neonates who developed BPD than in those who did not. Plateletderived growth factor (PDGF)-B was exclusively transcribed at high levels in the neonates who developed BPD but not respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). The morbidity rate of BPD was higher in high expression group of TGF-\u03b21, IL-10 and IFN-\u03b3 than in the each low expression group. On the other hand, the morbidity rate of RDS in BPD patients was lower in high expression group of PDGF-B than in the low expression group. The immunohistochemistry of lung tissue revealed that PDGF-BB-positive cells were dominantly found in a patient with Wilson-Mikity syndrome. Conclusions: These results suggested that IL-10 expression was involved in the damage of lung tissue irrespective of the presence or absence of RDS, and that PDGF-B in pulmonary inflammatory cells was associated with the development of BPD in the neonates without RDS. IL-10 and PDGF-B levels in TAF cells could be a prognostic marker for the long-term outcome of the newborns with early respiratory distress. Conclusions: New BPD has a characteristically early bubble lung, requires a longer duration of ventilator, and may not be adequately prevented by antenatal steroid therapy. Understanding these differences between new and classical BPD is important to predict infants at risk of developing severe BPD and to design appropriate strategies for the prevention.",

We used an umbilical vein catheter for 21 days. We did not give intravenous amino acids until 17th days of age. Although we supplemented calcium, phosphorus and vitamin D to maintain the serum calcium, phosphorus level 9.0 mg/dl and 5.5 mg/dl respectively, rickets of prematurity was exacerbated resulting in pathological bone fractures. Case 2: The baby girl was delivered by cesarean section at 25 weeks of gestation because of pregnancy induced hypertension. Her birth weight was 265 g. We used an umbilical vein catheter for 24 days. We started early aggressive nutritional support using intravenous amino acids immediately after birth. Her weight gain was much better than Case 1. Although we supplemented calcium, phosphorus and vitamin D as case 1, rickets of prematurity was exacerbated resulting in a thigh-bone fracture. Conclusions 1. It was useful to use an umbilical vein catheter for long days. 2. Aggressive nutrition was useful even for the infant who was born less than 300 g. 3.

We examined the effects and kinetics of magnesium ion which is known to have myocardial protective effect. (Methods) Rat hearts of adult (10weeks old) and neonate (1week old) were Langendorff-perfused and subjected to a 45 min hypoxia /30 min reoxygenation. Heart rate, ventricular tension and GOT release were monitored throughout the experiment. The magnesium content of myocardium after the perfusion was quantified by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. (Results) Heart rate and ventricular contraction in neonatal hearts were maintained higher level by hypoxia and were recovered faster by reoxygenation than those of adult. The recovery level of tension-rate product was not significantly different between neonates and adults after reoxygenation. Although GOT release increased by reoxygenation in adults, it was not the case in neonates.

(Conclusion) We suggest that the high tolerance against hypoxia-reoxygenation injury in neonatal hearts may be derived from the ability of maintaining intracellular magnesium. Purpose; Several studies suggest an association of eNOS gene polymorphisms to cerebrovascular diseases in adults. There are three clinically significant polymorphisms identified in the eNOS gene. We analysed the association of eNOS gene polymorphisms to perinatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy(HIE) in neonates. Method; Thirty seven term newborn infants with moderate to severe perinatal HIE(HIE group) and fifity four normal term infants without any perinatal problems(control group) were genotyped by PCR for two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs): 786 T\u2192C in promoter region and 894 G\u2192T in exon 7 (Glu298Asp). A variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) polymorphism in intron 4 was also investigated. Results; No significant difference was found in the distribution of genotype frequencies of the three eNOS polymorphisms between HIE and control groups.

However, the limitation in the 31 P-MRS method related to infants is the inability to estimate cerebral metabolism at the bedside. Recently, we have demonstrated that near-infrared time-resolved spectroscopy (TRS) can be used for non-invasive measurements of cerebral blood volume (CBV) and cerebral Hb oxygenation (ScO2) in infants at the bedside. In this study, we investigated changes in cerebral hemodynamics in asphyxiated infants by using TRS. Measurements by TRS were performed in 5 asphyxiated infants (3 with cerebral palsy and 2 with no developmental abnormalities) to estimate the values of CBV and ScO2 during a period of 80 hours after birth, and these values were compared with the values in 12 infants without asphyxia. In asphyxiated infants who had cerebral palsy, CBV and ScO2 increased transiently after birth and reached maximum levels after 36 and 48 hours, respectively. However, asphyxiated infants with good prognosis and infants without asphyxia did not show transient increases in CBV and ScO2. The increase in CBV is due to loss of cerebral autoregulation and, the increase in ScO2 is due to a decrease in oxygen consumption that leads to a decrease in venous Hb oxygen saturation.",

MATERIAL: A review of charts for a period of six months, from July to December 2004 was done. This was supplemented by follow on the patient's records with their attending physicians and personal call on the caregiver to obtain the needed information regarding the patient's hepatitis b vaccination status and acceptability of hepatitis b vaccine birth dose. RESULTS: Maternal occupation affects administration of birth dose and its completion, that is greater in employed mothers . The compliance for completion of the vaccine series among those given and not given the birth dose is not significant. Completion of the hepatitis b vaccine for the whole population is 90.2% however, the acceptability of receiving the vaccine at birth is only 50% of the population.

Recently, it was found that large sized high density lipoprotein particles were identified predominance in cord blood. Purpose: The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between subclasses of HDL particles and ApoE levels in cord blood, and the change of this association in postnatal period. Subjects and Methods: Sixty-five healthy, term, appropriate for gestational age neonates (38 males, 27 females) were included. Anthropometric parameters and serum lipids and apolipoproteins were determined at birth and at 1 month. Serum lipoprotein analyses were performed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with gel permeation columns, which could classify HDL into 5 subgroups on the basis of particle size. ApoE levels were measured by turbidimetric immunoassay. Results: Levels of very large (VL) HDL were 5.4\u00b12.6, and 7.0\u00b14.1 (male, and female, Average\u00b1SD), which were higher than those reported in adults. One month after birth, the levels of VLHDL-C increased to 8.0\u00b14.0, and 9.3\u00b15.3. Cord blood apoE levels correlated positively with very large HDL cholesterol levels at birth (male, r= 0.548, p<0.01; female, r= 0.631, p<0.01), but in male this association was not significant at 1 month. Recently it has been shown that venipuncture was less painful than heel prick for blood taking requiring minimally four drops of blood. The aim of this study was to determine whether there was a difference in the pain indicators and effectiveness between venipuncture and heel prick if only one drop of blood is required (e.g. blood glucose testing) in term neonates. Methods: Sixty six term neonates undergoing blood glucose monitoring in the neonatal intensive care unit of Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia during June and July 2006 were included in this study. The neonates underwent venipuncture (VP) or heel prick(HP). Primary outcome measures included were the Neonatal Facial Scoring System(NFCS) score, duration of the first cry, total duration of cry and duration of procedure. Secondary outcome measured was the number of skin puncture needed to obtain blood. Results: The NFCS score was not significantly different between the two groups and the duration of the procedure was significantly longer for the VP than the HP group (median 27.5sec versus 7sec; P < 0.001). The differences between the two groups for duration of first cry, total duration of cry and number of skin punctures needed to obtain blood were not statistically significant but these parameters displayed a trend, favouring the heel prick. Conclusions: Heel prick is still the preferred method of blood taking in neonates if only one drop of blood is required as in determination of blood glucose level.",

In this study, we investigated the benefits of early intervention of LTRA in food allergy children. METHODS: 50 children aged between 0 to 3 years of age with food allergy who experienced adverse responses, such as diarrhea, vomiting, bloody stool, rush, eczema, cough, and wheezing, against food antigens were enrolled for this study. Children were randomly divided in two groups. First 22 children were treated only with dietary control as a control group, and the rest of 28 children were treated with LTRA in addition to dietary control for one year. Peripheral blood eosinophil counts and serum IgE, IL-4, -5, -6, ECP, and PAF levels between pre and post-treatment were analyzed. RESULTS: Peripheral blood eosinophil counts and serum IgE, IL-4, -5, -6, ECP, and PAF levels were increased in children with food allergy. Although both groups showed clinical benefits with decreased eosinophil counts, only children treated with LTRA showed decreased serum IgE, IL-5, and ECP levels in addition to eosinophil counts. CONCLUSION: Our findings may indicate the possible anti-allergic effects of LTRA, by regulating peripheral blood eosinophil counts and serum IgE, IL-5, ECP levels especially in young children, aged between 0 to 3 years, with food allergy.",

Recent NSE/IL-6 transgenic mouse studies have indicated the pathogenic role of IL-6 in growth impairment of sJIA through systemic mechanisms that alter the GH/IGF-I axis. We investigated how IL-6 affects growth plate chondrocyte differentiation and proliferation. Materials and Methods: IL-6 receptor and gp130 expression by the murine chondrocyte embryonal carcinoma cell line ATDC5 was investigated by FACS analysis. Cells were incubated in 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C in culture medium containing 10 \u03bcg/ml of bovine insulin (culture day 0), and were consecutively harvested for 14 full days. Recombinant murine IL-6 was added to the cultures on all the days between days 2 and 14 to observe cell proliferation, and, useing a quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) to three chondrogenic differentiation markers, collagen type II, aggrecan, and collagen type X, the effect on cell differentiation. To test IL-6 function blocking, the anti-mouse IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody MR16-1, was added from day 2. Findings: The cells expressed IL-6 receptor and gp130. The expression of chondrogenic differentiation marker genes was reduced by IL-6, but this was abrogated by MR16-1. Interpretation: IL-6 directly inhibits early growth plate chondrocyte differentiation. Relevance to practice: Growth impairment in sJIA is brought about in part through the direct inhibitory effect of IL-6 on early differentiation of growth plate chondrocytes.

Case: A 9-year-old boy was transferred with diplopia and left sided weakness following minor head trauma. Neuroophthalmologic examination showed impairment of abduction of left eye. The muscle strength of left upper and lower extremities is grade 3+ and 4, respectively. T2-weighted images on MRI showed abnormal high signal intensity at right mesodiencephalic lesion. On diffusion weighted images, slightly high signal change was revealed, and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps had high signal intensity. Despite a negative pathergy test and absence of typical genito-ocular lesion, we diagnosed him as having NBD, based on history of recurrent oral aphthous ulcer, erythema nodosum, joint pain, absence of autoantibodies and characteristic findings of brain MRI. Subsequently, pulse methylprednisolone was initiated, followed by daily oral prednisolone. After 9 days of therapy, second MRI showed complete improvement of the brain lesion accompanied by improvement of neurological manifestations. During 2-months of follow up, he was complete recovery from diplopia and left sided weakness. Conclusion: Although NBD is rare in children, it should be considered when brain MRI reveals parenchymal inflammatory lesions that include mesodiencephalic area. And it should be further evaluated that causal relationship between minor head trauma and the onset of NBD. Accumulation of information on patients with various diseases, intervention trials based on the accumulated case information, and analyses of disease information are required for the practice of evidence-based medicine (EBM) and evidence-based policy making. A research project to develop \"Integrated DB for Pediatric Diseases\" in the National Center for Child Health and Development (NCCHD) has been under way since 2005. A case registration method to achieve two goals that are different in character, exhaustive registration of case information on many types of diseases and improving accuracy of individual case information, needs to be developed for the integrated DB. In order to achieve the almost conflicting goals, development of the integrated DB to accumulate information on multiple cases was thought to be necessary. \"Case Information DB\", a prototype of \"Integrated DB for Pediatric Diseases\", is comprised of information accumulated in the internal server of the NCCHD. The information sources for the DB include data from Research Project for Specific Chronic Pediatric Diseases and Follow-Up Study of Neonatal Screening Programs. We decided to develop an automatic cross-check program for the two information sources. The automatic cross-check program compared the two information sources and automatically calculated the estimated number of cases of specific diseases by using the capture-recapture method merely based on date of birth, place of residence, and sex of patients. We will conduct further demonstration experiments on the program by using more information sources.",

The most common single nucleotide polymorphism of IGFBP promoter region is -202 locus. In vitro, significantly higher promoter activity of the A allele at the -202 locus compared with the C allele, consistent with the relationship observed between genotype and circulating IGFBP-3 was documented. The polymorphic variation occurs frequently and may influence GH responsiveness, somatic growth, but the effects of IGFBP-3 promoter polymorphism on growth in children are unknown. Methods: RFLP genotyping of the -202 single nucleotide polymorphism was performed in 33 Korean children who visited our clinic for evaluation of their growth. The serum levels of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 were compared according to genotyping. Results: Height SDS of subjects was -1.48\u00b11.10. 11 of 33 children (33%) were heterozygous AC and the others are homozygous AA in genetic distribution, but no homozygous CC was detected. C allele frequency was 16.7%. There were no significant differences in height, body mass index, serum IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 levels between AC and AA groups. Conclusion: The effects of IGFBP-3 promoter polymorphism on growth at the -202 locus deserve investigation because there is no CC and the children were relatively short in this study. [Background] It has been reported that infants borne with small for gestational age may be accompanied with obesity and type 2 diabetes leading causes of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in later life, which is supposed to be a link with catch-up mechanism on their growth.

The relation between these biochemical abnormalities and impaired differentiations and migration of neural cells, which are the major pathological findings in the central nervous system of ZS, remains to be clarified. In order to characterize the molecular events in the pathogenesis of ZS, we analyzed molecular species of glycerophospholipids in the brain of ZS by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry (FAB-MS). At first, purified phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphayidylcholine (PC) were treated with 0.05 M HCl to estimate the amounts of plasmalogen, and were found that plasmalogen-type PE was comprised 30% of total PE in control brain, but was not detected in ZS brain, while plasmalogen-type PC was not contained in both control and ZS brain. FAB-MS revealed that plasmalogen-type PE in control gray matter were contained arachidonic (20:4) and docosapentaenoic (22:5) acids, all of which were completely absent in ZS gray matter. Diacyl PE with polyunsaturated fatty acids were compensatory elevated in ZS brain in comparison to those in control brain.

We examined mutations in the ATP7A gene in 46 unrelated patients and 1 related patient with MD. Furthermore, carrier detection was performed in 22 mothers of the patients, and prenatal/neonatal diagnosis was performed in 7 male siblings. Genomic DNA was prepared from peripheral blood lymphocytes, cultured fibroblasts or amniocytes, and amplified by PCR. The direct sequencing of exons was performed with a 3700 DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Forty different mutations were identified in the 43 patients; 10 nonsense mutations, 6 missense mutation, 10 splice-site mutations, and 14 insertion/deletion mutations. Most ATP7A mutations in these patients were identified in important functional/ structural domains of protein products such as copper binding domains, transmembrane domains, CPC motif, and ATP binding domains. Four patients were not found mutations. Eighteen of 22 mothers of patients (77.3%) were carriers of Menkes disease, while 5 mothers (22.7%) were not carriers.

Here we applied this method to tissue AC analysis and measured tissue ACs in two patients with MMA. Cases: Two girls were chemically diagnosed by GC/MS and had genetic mutations of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase gene. Both were dead because of acute metabolic decompensation and tissue samples were collected by autopsy after informed consent. Method: ACs that were extracted from the lyophilized tissues were purified by solid phase extraction and applied to the HPLC-ESI/MS-MS system with multiple reaction monitoring. Result: In the samples of urine and serum, PC concentrations were much higher than the MMC. The same result was seen in the kidney samples, whereas, high concentrations of MMC were determined in the liver and skeletal muscle. This discrepancy of the AC levels in the tissues should be elucidated.",

Early diagnosis could improve prognosis of patients with SCOT deficiency. We report a Japanese boy with SCOT deficiency diagnosed by critical samples in acidotic crisis during neonate. The patient was born through uneventful vaginal delivery with Apgar 9/10. At 2 days of age, tachypnea and poor sucking were noted. The blood gas analysis showed metabolic acidosis (pH 7.072, HCO3-5.8 mmol/L). The urine ketone bodies were positive (+++). He was treated with intravenous infusion of glucose and sodium bicarbonate. When transferred to our institution at 4 days of age, he no longer represents tachypnea and metabolic acidosis. The urine ketone bodies remained positive (+). Urine organic acid analysis during the metabolic acidosis showed only massive excretion of metabolites from ketone bodies. Enzymatic assay showed the significant decrease in the activity of SCOT from the patient (0.25 nmol/min/mg protein; control, 3.9). Direct sequence of genomic DNA identified compound heterozygous mutations in the OXCT1 gene (c.658_666dup, p.Asn220_Ile222dup; c.1304 C>A, p.Thr435Asn). The 658_666dup has not described yet. The three amino acid residue (Asn220_Ile222) of SCOT protein was reported to be important for dimerization of the SCOT. Although he suffered from ketoacidotic crises twice since the discharge at 30 days of age, he overcome these crises after early intervention of intravenous glucose administration. These data confirm that Asn220_Ile222 is important residue for the activity of SCOT and suggest that early diagnosis with critical samples is beneficial for children with SCOT deficiency.",

We encountered a 29-year-old disable man who had been on gastric tube feeding for seven years and presented a diffuse goiter and myxedema. His thyroid function was low <fT4 <, 0.4ng/dl > with a high thyrotropin level<TSH 56.288\u00b5U/ml>, while both anti-thyroglobulin and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies were negative. The liquid formula used for 7 years was found to provide him with 20\u00b5g iodine per day. Hypothyroidism due to iodine deficiency was suspected as daily requirement of iodine is suggested to be from 150 to 200\u00b5g while the average iodine intake in Japan is 1mg. Levo-throxine <25\u00b5g/day>and supplementation of iodine were initiated. 500\u00b5g/day of iodine was supplemented with a seaweed drink via the gastric tube. His diffuse goiter was improved and euthyroid function was achieved immediately after the treatment. These days the number of cases on long term gastric tube feeding is increasing. Insufficient iodine intake during a gastric feeding should be considered and appropriate amount of iodine may be supplemented if necessary. The drink used for the present case is a Japanese traditional drink obtained as a preservable and soluble powder made from seaweeds or Laminaria japonica and salt. Since over intake of iodine may also result in thyroid dysfunction, the seaweed drink seems to be a safe, effective and economical remedy to supply iodine during long term gastric feeding.",

However, some other extrathoracic causes may cause respiratory distress, such as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). We presented a very uncommon case of asthma concurrent with the first onset of DKA for intending to alert the emergency physician to the additional respiratory distress imposed by DKA Case Report: An eight-year-old girl with a history of asthma presented to pediatric emergency unit with shortness of breath and dyspnea. An asthma attack was considered and therapies were initiated. She also denied any history of other underlying diseases, including DM. Because of the poor control of respiratory distress, we intended to find whether any other diseases causing respiratory distress may coexist with asthma, and arranged some imaging and laboratory examinations. The blood glucose concentration by using the glucometry strip was found exceeding the measurable capacity. Furthermore, the urinalysis showed glycosuria exceeding 1000 mg/dL and ketonuria of 3+. The definite serum glucose level showed 398 mg/dL and serum ketone body was 40 mg/dL. Therefore, the presumption of DKA was made. The patient was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit. Biochemical laboratory tests about DM performed and showed serum glycosylated hemoglobin of 12.4% Discussion: Asthma attack with concurrent first-onset DKA is rare but critical. Prompt use of glucometry for determination of glucose concentration is of use in rapidly distinguishing DKA from other concurrent respiratory emergencies. When confronted with an intractable asthma exacerbation in the pediatric emergency unit, 1 Gyeongsang National Univ. of Hosp. Depart. of Pediatrics, 2 Gyeongsang National Univ. of Hosp. Depart. of Pathology, 3 Gyeongsang National University College of Medicine. Depart. of Microbiology Objectives: The purpose of this study was whether it is possible to culture of H. pylori from cryopreserved gastric mucosal biopsies frozen with or without OCT compound for more than 10 years. Method: Forty-six cryopreserved antral biopsy specimens with OCT compound and 31 ones without OCT compound sampled from 46 pediatric patients were used. The samples were collected in either 1990 (15, OCT only) or 1992 (31) and deeply frozen in eppedndorf tube without other preservatives (-70\u00b0C). Frozen gastric biopsies were cultured at 37\u00b0C for 7 days. Results: H. pylori were recovered from 29 (63%) among 46 biopsies. Histopathologic examination of 42 patients revealed bacteria infiltration on gastric antral mucosa. The recovery rate from biopsies cryopreseved in OCT compound was 93% at 1990 years and 13% at 1992 years. The recovery rate was higher in antral specimens stored in OCT compound at 1990 years than 1992 years. And the recovery rate from biopsies cryopreseved in OCT compound was 39%, and the rate of positive culture utilizing without OCT compound was 48%. There were no differences in histopathologic findings between biopsies cryopreserved with OCT compound and without that. The recovery rate would be higher if the gastric mucosal biopsy specimens were kept at -70\u00b0C with tight seals and were kept from being freeze-dried. Conclusion: Gastric mucosa per se is the best cryostorage media as well as the best transport media if it were kept in tight sealing and from being freeze-dried.",

They received nutritional supplements, and were discharged when the nutritional status improved to either oedema-free weight-for-age >50% or weight-for-length >80%. Results: 56% of the study children (n=239) were male. Median age of the mothers was 22 years, and 18% of them had chronic energy deficiency. Half of the mothers were illiterate, and 24% of them had some form of employment, 16% had no sanitary toilets, and 34% had no access to safe drinking water. About one-third (n=85, 36%) of the children had admission pedal edema, 84% were severely underweight, 62% were severely stunted and 19% had severe wasting. The mean weight gain of children with non-pedal oedema was 8 g/kg/day; weight gain of the severely underweight were significantly higher than those of non-severely underweight (8 g/kg/day vs. 5 g/kg/day, p=0.02); severely stunted had better weight gain than non-severely stunted (9 g/kg/day vs. 5 g/kg/day, p=0.02); and severely wasted gained better weight than non-severely wasted (11 g/kg/day vs. 6 g/kg/day, p=0.001). Conclusions: Improvement of nutrition was more marked in severely malnourished children who are more eligible for nutrition rehabilitation interventions which may be directed towards such population. Risperidone is an antipsychotic in wide use for psychiatric disorders such as ADHD and autism in paediatric patients. It is converted by P450 enzymes into 9-hydroxyrisperidone, which has a pharmacological activity comparable to its parent compound. Substantial inter-individual variability has been observed in the dose-normalized concentrations of risperidone and the 9-hydroxy metabolite. This variability has been partly accounted for by polymorphisms in CYP2D6, which has more than 10 mutant alleles.",

In addition, we found that gene expression signature of MLL rearrangement was different among these pediatric subgroups as well. These results suggest that age is an important factor contributing to the biology of myelo-monocytic AML. Recently, it was found that rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) was induced with extremely high penetrance in Ink4a/Arf -/mice transgenic for MET protooncogene. PTPN11 encodes SH2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase, which relaying signals from activated growth factors and cytokine receptors to RAS and other intracellular signaling molecules. To address the roles of these genes in RMS, the most common soft-tissue sarcoma in children, we performed mutational analysis in 39 samples by PCR-SSCP. No mutations of MET were detected whereas a nonsense mutation of p16INK4A was identified in an alveolar RMS. Also, we identified a missense mutation of PTPN11 in an embryonal RMS (ERMS) and missense mutations of NRAS in 2 ERMSs having no PTPN11 mutations. By real-time quantitative PCR, expression of MET was found varied more than 10-fold among these samples, despite a normal DNA copy number. The protein expression level was consistent with that of mRNA, and in cell lines with a higher expression level, MET was constitutively activated. Notably, the expression level of MET was significantly higher in patients who died (P = 0.02), in patients with stage IV (P = 0.04), as well as in patients with PAX3-FKHR chimeric transcript (P = 0.04). On the other hand, reduced or absent expression of p16INK4A/p14ARF only showed significant correlation with the age at diagnosis. These data suggests that p16INK4A/ p14ARF, PTPN11 and RAS may involve in the pathogenesis of some RMS whereas MET may play a role in the progression of RMS.

Department of Pediatrics, Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University Background: Osteoporosis represents an important cause of morbidity in patients with severe thalassemia. The pathogenesis of osteoporosis in severe thalassemia is multifactorial, and includes bone marrow expansion, endocrine dysfunction, and iron overload. However, the mechanism through which these factors lead to bone loss have not been complete clarified. Osteoblasts are the bone-forming cells and arise from mesenchymal stem cell (MSCs). We therefore would like to study the MSC function in severe thalassemia patients to elucidate the bone formation dysfunction mechanism in these patients. Patients and Methods: Twenty ml of heparinized bone marrow was recovered from 10 severe thalassemia patients and 12 healthy volunteer donors. CD105+ cells were purified from each marrow sample by immunomagnetic isolation. Osteoblast differentiation genes expressions by Quantitative Real-Time RT -PCR were studied from these CD105+ cells. The osteoblast differentiation genes were consisted with cbfa1, osterix, osteocalcin, alkaline phosphatase, bone morphogenic protein-2, MSX-2, and type I collagen Results: The medians of fold difference of the most of osteoblast differentiation genes expressions from thalassemia patients were lower than healthy controls (genes expression = 1). Background: Ligneous conjunctivitis is a rare form of membranous conjunctivitis characterized by fibrin-rich, wood-like membranes mainly on tarsal conjunctivae. The disease usually affects children, girls more than boy, but may occur at any age. It appears to be the ocular manifestation of a systemic disease, which might be accompanied by formation of pseudomembrane or membrane in multiple organs such as the mouth, the tracheobroncial tree, and the female genital tracts. Most treatment attempts have so far been unsatisfactory. This report describes a case of ligneous conjunctivitis presented at early infancy whose investigation revealed a plasminogen deficiency. Method: Case report Result: A 4 year-old girl presented with bilateral recurrent membranous conjunctivitis since 1 month of age. Plasma plasminogen functional activity from the patient and mother was 15.2% and 78% respectively (normal 80-120%). Multimodality treatment was given including membrane excision, topical corticosteroid, topical cyclosporine, topical heparin, topical serum and fresh frozen plasma, with improvement. Histology of the excised membranes revealed thick amorphous material composed predominantly of mononuclear inflammatory cells, scattered polymorphonuclear cells and areas of fibrin, consistent with ligneous conjunctivitis. A patient was improved with nearly resolved of the membrane in her right eye and thin layer of membrane in her left eye. Conclusion: Ligneous conjunctivitis associated with plasminogen deficiency should be considered in differential diagnosis of cases with recurrent membranous conjunctivitis.",

We reported that LAT2, specifically expressed in the basolateral membrane of proximal tubules. The aim of the present study is to determine whether mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) 1 is implicated in the cell proliferation process of the glomerular crescent. First we tried immunohistochemitry with LAT2 and its functional ligand, 4F2 hevay chain (4F2hc) in the specimens of crescentic glomerulonephritis (GN). Both LAT2 and 4F2hc were strongly observed in the cellular crescent lesion of IgA nephropathy and ANCA related GN. Rat glomeruli injected with anti-GBM antibody revealed apparent plasma membrane pattern of LAT2 and 4F2hc expression in the cellular crescent. RT-PCR and Western blot study revealed time dependent increase of LAT2 and 4F2hc at both mRNA and protein levels in the samples from isolated glomeruli at day 0, 2, 5, and 7 after injection of anti-GBM antibody. Finally to determine whether LAT2 is directly involved in the cell proliferation machinery, we established S2 cell line expressing full-length human LAT2 (S2hLAT2). Starvation experiment revealed significant increase of phosphorylation with eIF4E binding protein and ribosomal protein S6 (p70) kinases in S2hLAT2 cells compared to wild S2 cells. Taken together, we conclude that LAT2 may participate in the crescent formation through activating mTOR1 pathway via the transport of branched-chain amino acid into BC in various glomerular diseases.

Lowintensity signal in WM on FLAIR significantly correlated with physical and total developmental quotients, whereas diffuse high-intensity signal in WM on T2-weighted imaging correlated only with the total developmental quotient at 6 years (n=75, WISC-R). FLAIR imaging, but not T2-weighted imaging, predicted mild neuro-developmental delay at this age. Conclusion: FLAIR appeared to detect subtle WM injury related with neuro-developmental disorders at schoolage, whereas T2-weighted imaging seemed to identify relatively more severe WM injury. FLAIR is a potentially sensitive screening tool for many infants that is readily available and easily interpretable.",

            "text": "Oxidative stress in neurodegeneration in dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy Background: Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is one of CAG-repeat diseases, and it is classified into juvenile, showing progressive myoclonus epilepsy (PME), early adult and late adult types. The common neuropathological findings in DRPLA include degenerations of the basal ganglia and dentate nucleus. It has been discussed in Huntinton's disease that expanded polyglutamine can lead to oxidative neurodegeneration, and we examined involvement of oxidative stress in brain lesions in DRPLA. Method: We performed immunohistochemistry for accumulation of oxidative products and expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD), a radical scavenger, in serial brain sections in autopsy cases of DRPLA. Results: Oxidative products of nucleosides, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine and 8-hydroxyguanosine, were accumulated in the lenticulate nucleus predominantly in DRPLA cases having PME. Mild neuronal accumulation of 4-hydroxy nonenal, a reactive lipid aldehyde, was found in the hippocampus, globus pallidus and cerebellar dentate nucleus in the adult DRPLA cases and controls. Cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for Cu/ZnSOD was reduced in the external segment of globus pallidus, dentate nucleus and cerebellar cortex in most DRPLA cases. Mitochondrial immunoreactivity for MnSOD was reduced in the lenticulate nucleus and cerebellum in DRPLA cases having PME. Some DRPLA cases also showed reduced immunoreactivity for MnSOD in the cerebral cortex. Coexistence of reduced SOD expression and expanded polyglutamine was observed in the frontal cortex or lenticulate nucleus in a few cases. Conclusion: It is likely that oxidative stress can be involved also in DRPLA, although the exact relationship with expanded polyglutamine remains to be elusive.",

            "text": "Background: There are several studies on the maturation of proprioceptive nerves in neonates and a few in preterm infants. Purpose: To evaluate the maturation of efferent motor nerve and afferent sensory nerve in comparison between full-term (FT) and preterm infants (PT), M waves and H-reflex were examined at a similar post-conceptional age. Subjects and Methods: Eleven FT (gestational age 38~41weeks) and PT infants (gestational age 26~34weeks) were recruited for the study. Informed consents were obtained from the parents. M-wave and H-reflex were recorded within the first week of life for the FT infants while the same parameters were measured for premature babies when they reached the expected time of birth using four channel evoked potential examination apparatus (Signal processor-7S12; NEC Medical Systems). The median nerve was stimulated at the wrist and elbow and M-wave and H-reflex were recorded from the abductor pollicis previs muscle. The motor and proprioceptive nerves conduction velocities (MCV and HCV, respectively) were determined by dividing the difference in latency between the onset of the proximal and distal responses by that distance. Results: The MCV of PT (25.0\u00b14.5m/s) was comparable to those of FT infants (25.5\u00b14.5m/s). In contrast, the HCV of PT (20.1\u00b15.6m/s) was significantly lower than those of FT infants (25.0\u00b110.0m/s). Conclusion: These findings suggest that myelination in the afferent sensory nerves may delay in the extrauterine environment for PT infants. Maturation of proprioceptive nerve of PT infants hence may be influenced by nutrition or medication after birth. To be able to determine the prevalence of developmental concerns in apparently well children aged 1-3 years old by using the Filipino Denver Developmental Screening Tool. STUDY DESIGN: cross sectional. STUDY POPULATION: All children ages 1-3 years old (63) at Brgy Minantok, Amadeo, Cavite who fulfilled the inclusion criteria. METHODOLOGY: All children aged 1-3 years old were interviewed. Parents were asked to fill-out a questionnaire regarding socio-demographics. A scheduled interview regarding the socio-demographic, maternal factors, and neonatal factors was conducted. Afterwards, Filipino Denver Developmental Screening Test was administered. Background data of subjects who have been identified with developmental concern were revisited and risk factors present in their histories were determined and reported for correlation. RESULT: Almost 63 subjects screened had unremarkable demographic, maternal, paternal and neonatal histories which may contribute to the child's development. Two of the population screened were noted to have developmental concern, 1 as language delay and the other as fine motor delay. Back ground: Olmsted syndrome is a rare disorder which was first described by Olmsted HC in 1927, and is dermatologically characterized with sharply marginated keratoderma in the palms and soles, perioral keratoderma and alopecia. We reported a 23-year-old male patient with Olmsted syndrome showing rare neurological and immunological complications. Case presentation: There was no family history of keratosis or neurological disorders. In infancy, he suffered from marginated keratoderma, and acrodermatitis entheropathica was suspected, which was temporally controlled by replacement therapy of zinc sulfate. Gradual development of periorificial and bilateral palmoplantar keratoderma with alopecia led to the diagnosis of Olmsted syndrome, and hyperkeratosis in skin biopsy specimen supported the diagnosis. He also demonstrated motor clumsiness, mental retardation, optic nerve atrophy, spastic gait, and hyporeflexia with numbness at the ends of extremities. He was suspected as having primary peripheral neuropathy because of delayed conduction velocity and reduced myelinated fibers in biopsied peroneal nerve. He also developed multiple demyelinated lesions and asymptomatic signal change in the corpus callosum on magnetic resonance imaging in addition to having sepsis repetitively. At the age of 23, he was complicated with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and he died of sepsis one year after. Conclusion: The occurrence of neurological and immunological complications itself is rare in Olmsted syndrome, but that may suggest the possible linkage between hyperkeratotic syndrome and neurological and/or immunological disturbances.",

Objectives: Adnexal torsion is an acute abdominal condition often confused with other diseases in children. The objective of this study is to evaluate the diagnosis, characteristics and treatment of adnexal torsion in children to reduce morbidity. Methods: We reviewed the medical records of all cases of children whose adnexal torsion diagnosis was proven by surgery from 1992 to 2005. Prenatal cases were excluded. Results: A total of 49 cases were enrolled; the mean age was 12.5 years. Sixteen (32.6%) cases were premenarchal girls. This group was significantly more likely to have adnexal problems missed at first clinical diagnosis compared to postmenarchal girls (P=0.032). Of patients, 32% had severe abdominal pain and 14.2% had a history of recurrent pain over 2 weeks. Of abdominal gray scale ultrasound evaluated in 43 patients, 41 were suspicious for ovarian pathology. Seventeen patients had both ultrasound (US) and abdominal computerized tomography (CT).

This announcement was in response to unusual suicide after taking oseltamivir phosphate in Japan. We present two adolescent-boys who manifested abnormal behavior during the each clinical course of influenza B virus infection. Case1: A 14-year-old Japanese boy was diagnosed influenza B and prescribed oseltamivir phosphate by another hospital. 3.5 hours after taking oseltamivir phosphate, he suddenly manifested abnormal behavior (He was walking around the room, defying his mother and his older brother) and arrived to our hospital. Case2: A 13-year-old Japanese boy was diagnosed influenza B and not prescribed oseltamivir phosphate by another hospital. His temperature became normal on 6th day, but he manifested drowsiness and abnormal behavior(e.g. he could answer the question, but could not stay awake. He suddenly called his mother on the phone and told her what had never happened.), then his family took him to our hospital. Discussion: Both cases are completely recovered without any medication. It is very difficult to diagnose case1 as side effect of oseltamivir phosphate because influenza infection, itself, manifests abnormal behavior, which was seen in case 2. Although the relationship between oseltamivir phosphate and suicide was not clarified, we must take these events extremely serious. And also we need to distinguish between influenza encephalopathy and these cases very carefully.",

Two cases each of MPSIIIB and II showed immunoreactivity for phosphorylated alpha-synuclein but not ubiquitin in the thalamus. The temporal cortex in two cases of MPSIIIB demonstrated immunoreactivity for phosphorylated alpha-synuclein in the ballooned pyramidal neurons, and to lesser extent small interneurons.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional.METHODOLOGY: Parents of children with autism presently enrolled at DLSU-NDC were asked to answer the pretested parent satisfaction scale. DQs of their child with autism were reviewed from records with emphasis on the initial and post-therapy DQ provided the Griffiths mental developmental scale was used and therapy at least 6 months. Difference of DQ form the initial and post-therapy were known. Correlation between the parent satisfaction and initial and change in DQ was done using the Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient. RESULTS: Twenty five out 57 children with autism currently enrolled at DLSU-NDC fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Most of the children with autism have a 51-75 average DQ. Most changes in DQs were 0-5 incremental range. Parents were most satisfied with the support staff/therapist followed by child's medical history and referral experience/evaluation, the program/on-going therapy, parental coping techniques/illness conceptualization, and outcome of therapy/child's present condition. Correlation between parental satisfaction and initial DQ using the Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient showed no proof of correlation between the variables as well as the changes in DQs of their child. CONCLUSION: There is no correlation between parental satisfaction and initial and change in DQs of children enrolled at DLSU-NDC. A sense of satisfaction may not be on the domains mentioned but by knowing that their child is given much attention and intervention.",

Conclusions: Restrictive RV physiology is common in PAIVS patients after biventricular repair, which limits RV dilation and is associated with better exercise capacity.Pak-cheong Chow 1 , Xuecun liang 1 , Wendy WM Lam 2 , Eddie WY Cheung 1 , Kintak Wong 1 , Yiu-fai Cheung 1 1 The University of Hong Kong, Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Division of Paediatric Cardiology, 2 Department of Radiology, Queen Mary Hospital, Background: Recent data suggest potential benefits of cardiac resynchronization therapy in the management of right ventricular (RV) dysfunction in congenital heart disease. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and functional implications of RV dyssynchrony in patients after Senning or Mustard procedure for transposition of the great arteries. Methods: Twenty-eight patients, aged 21.1\u00b13.5 years at 19.9\u00b13.2 years after atrial switch operation, and 29 age-matched healthy controls were studied. The times from onset of QRS to peak systolic strain (T\u03b5) at the base of and mid RV lateral wall, interventricular septum (IVS) and left ventricular (LV) free wall were determined using tissue Doppler echocardiography. Intraventricular dyssynchrony was defined as \u0394T\u03b5RV-IVS and interventricular dyssynchrony as \u0394T\u03b5RV-LV. In patients, the magnitude of RV intra-and interventricular dyssynchrony was correlated with cardiac magnetic resonance-derived RV volumes and ejection fraction (n=26) and treadmill exercise testing parameters (n=20). Results: Compared with controls, patients had significantly longer \u0394T\u03b5RV-IVS (48.1\u00b150.9 ms vs 17.0\u00b116.1 ms, p<0.001) and \u0394T\u03b5RV-LV (63.1\u00b149.5ms vs 19.0\u00b112.9ms, p<0.001). Nine patients (32%) exhibited RV dyssynchrony (\u0394T\u03b5RV-IVS>49ms, control mean+2SD), while 16 patients (57%) showed interventricular dyssynchrony (\u0394T\u03b5RV-LV>45ms). In patients, RV intra-and interventricular dyssynchrony correlated negatively with RV ejection fraction (both r=-0.42, p=0.03) and % predicted maximum oxygen consumption (r=-0.50, p=0.03, r=-0.52, p=0.02, respectively), and positively with VE/VCO2 slope(r  =0.49, p=0.03, and r=0.56, p=0.01, respectively). Conclusion: Right ventricular dyssynchrony is common in young adults after atrial switch operation and is associated with RV systolic dysfunction and impaired exercise performance.Byung-Won Yoo 1 , Jae Young Choi 1 , Jun Hee Sul 1 , Han Ki Park 2 , Young-Hwan Park 2 Division of pediatric cardiology, College of Medicine, Yonsei University, Department lf thoracic and cardiovascular surgery, College of Medicine,Yonsei University Purpose: We investigated the relationship between severity of pulmonary regurgitation(PR), exercise capacity, RV volume overload and function in the patients after repair of TOF. Methods: To evaluate exercise capacity, cardiopulmonary exercise test(CPX) was performed in 36 patients and 18 normal controls on a treadmill, and maximal oxygen consumption(VO2max) and anaerobic threshold(AT) were compared. In patient group, magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) study was performed and PR fraction(%), RV volume(ESV) and ejection fraction(EF) were measured and the RV volume was corrected by BSA(end-diastolic volume index:RVEDVI, end-systolic volume index:RVESVI). The patient group was divided into two subgroups by age, and influences of PR were compared between subgroups. Results: The VO2max and AT were significantly decreased in patients(30.9\u00b17.71 vs 38.1\u00b1 9.9ml/kg/min,P=0.01;1.06\u00b10.43 vs 1.44\u00b10.59l/min,P=0.03). PR fraction was inversely correlated with VO2max(r=-0.38,P=0.04), and had a tendency toward inverse correlation with AT(r=-0.28,P=0.19). RV volume increased with PR fraction(RVEDVI,r=0.60,P=0.001:RVESVI,r=0.49,P=0.007) while RVEF decreased with RV volume overload(RVESVI,r=-0.74,P<0.001). In the young age group(<15yr), PR fraction had a relationship with RV volume(RVEDVI,r=0.61 ,P=0.02:RVESVI,r=0.70,P=0.005) but no significant relationship with exercise capacity(r=-0.42,P=0.13). In the old age group, according to the severity of PR, RV volume increased(RVEDVI,r=0.71,P=0.003:RVESVI,r=0.53,P=0.04) and VO2max decreased(r=-0.65,P=0.02). And the decrease of VO2max was more tightly correlated with RVESVI(r=-0.77,P=0.003) than RVEDVI(r=-0.34,P=0.21). Conclusion: The patients after repair of TOF showed impaired exercise capacity than controls. PR has deleterious effects on the exercise capacity and RV volume overload, and the effects may be related with the age and/or duration of PR. RV volume overload may deteriorate RV function, and, especially the RV endsystolic volume was correlated with the impaired exercise capacity.Shigeki Yoshiba, Dai Takei, Megumi Matuoka, Kazuki Kouno, Hirotaka Oki, Masaru Miura, Masaaki Satou Division of Pediatric Cardiology, Tokyo Metropolitan Kiyose Children's Hospital BACKGROUND: After surgical repair in congenital heart disease, stent implantation (SI) is the standard treatment for branch pulmonary artery stenosis (PAS). SI for branch PAS in small children is still not common in Japan. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to evaluate the outcome of SI for branch PAS in Japanese small children. SUBJECTIVE: Between 2004 and 2006, 5 patients with branch PAS that could not be sufficiently dilated by BD underwent SI with weight ranging 7.1 -17.5 kg (median, 9.3). The primary diagnosis included tetralogy of Fallot (n=4), and corrected transposition of great arteries with subaortic ventricular septal defect and pulmonary atresia (n=1). EARLY RESULTS: 3 patients underwent intra-operative SI. 2 patients underwent transcatheter SI. Stents were successfully implanted in 5 of 5 patients. Branch PAS were dilated after SI (initial diameter : mean 3.mmHg. No re-intervention was required after SI (10 -41 months). CONCLUSION: The outcome of SI for branch PAS in children after surgical repair was satisfactory during early and mid-term follow up.Kazuki Kodo, Takuya Tamame, Takuya Hayashi, Jun Maeda, Hiroyuki Fukushima, Hiroyuki Yamagishi Keio University School of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics Introduction: Early development of pulmonary hypertension (PH) is frequently associated with patients with Down syndrome (DS) and congenital heart defect (CHD) that has left-to-right shunt. Although an early surgical intervention is recommended for such patients, it has not yet been clarified that the favorable age for operation to prevent postoperative residual PH. The purpose of this study is to elucidate the proper age of operation for CHD with left-to-right shunt in DS patients. Patients and methods: 72 consecutive Japanese DS children were included. All of them were operated for CHD with left-to-right shunt and evaluated the pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) by cardiac catheterization before and after operation. With statistical procedure, several risk factors of residual PH were estimated. Results: 22 patients had post operative residual PH (mean PAP\u226525mmHg). The age of operation showed significance with multivariable analysis (P =.017). No residual PH was shown among the patients who had operation within 5 months old. With ROC curves, in case age of operation was over first year, sensitivity and specificity of residual PH were more than 50%. The probability of residual PH showed significant difference between patients with operation during the first year and those with operation after the first year (P =.022). Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that early operation is effective to prevent postoperative residual PH in DS patients with left-to-right shunt. Operation at earlier than 6 months old resulted in no residual PH and that during the first year significantly reduced a risk for residual PH in such patients.Department of Pediatrics, Songklanakarind University, Had Yai, 2 Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, BangkokObjective: To evaluate efficacy and safety of stent implantation (SI) as compare with conventional balloon angioplasty (BA) and to report intermediate results and complications after SI in congenital heart disease. Methods: A retrospective study of 31 patients, who underwent SI between January 1998 and December 2006 at our institution. Procedural success is determined by either an increase of the stenotic diameter > 50% (anatomic success) or residual systolic pressure gradient (SPG) < 10 mmHg, decrease of SPG > 50%, decrease of the RV/systemic pressure > 20% (hemodynamic success). Result: The immediate results have shown that SI had a significant yield of success as compare to BA. In our report, stent success was varied from 50% -88% while BA providing only 27% -61%. In addition, when combine anatomic and hemodynamic successes together, SI group had a significant yield of success as compare to BA group, 83% and 24% respectively. The intermediate outcome in stent placement also showed satisfactory results for maintaining their patency over the years after implantation. Only 10% of SI cases developed stent failure. One of them had stent fracture and two had significant neointimal proliferation which only one patient required additional re-intervention. There was no procedure related mortality. Conclusion: Stent implantation is a feasible, effective and safe procedure in selected patients with either postoperative or congenital vascular stenosis in congenital heart disease.Takuro Ohno 1 , Jun Muneuchi 1 , Kenji Ihara 1 , Tetsuji Yuge 2 , Yoshiaki Kanaya 1 , Shigeo Yamaki 3 , Toshiro Hara 1 Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, 2 Department of Pediatrics, Kyushu Kouseinenkin Hospital, 3 Japanese Research Institute of Pulmonary Vasculature BACKGROUND: Pulmonary arterial hypertension has been reported to be observed in association with acquired portal hypertension. However, the contribution of congenital anomalies occurring in the portal system to the development of pulmonary arterial hypertension remains to be elucidated. METHODS AND RESULTS: Nine patients with congenital porto-systemic venous shunt were studied from January 1990 through September 2005. Patent ductus venosus was detected in five patients, including three patients with an absence of the portal vein. The presence of either a gastro-or splenorenal shunt was evident in another four patients. Six patients had a history of hypergalactosemia with normal enzyme activities, as seen during neonatal screening. Six (66.7%) of the nine patients were identified to have clinically significant pulmonary arterial hypertension (mean pulmonary artery pressure: 34-79 mmHg; pulmonary vascular resistances: 5.12-38.07 units). The median age at the onset of pulmonary arterial hypertension was 12 years and 3 months (range; 9 months -12 years and 9 months). Histological studies of lung specimens, which were available in four of the nine patients with CPSVS, showed small arterial micro-thrombotic lesions in three patients (2 with PAH, 1 without PAH). In particular, this characteristic finding was remarkable in the patients with PAH. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated thromboembolic pulmonary arterial hypertension to be a crucial complication in congenital porto-systemic venous shunt and this pathologic state may be latently present in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension of unknown etiology. KKR Tachikawa Hospital, Department of pediatrics, 2 Department of pediatric cardiology, Shimane institute of health science[Background] The effect of patent ductus arteriosus(PDA) to coronary flow is unclear. We try to clarify it.[Methods] Subject: 10 patients(three boys, seven girls) with PDA were entered. They were 1 year and 2 months to 16 year and 1 month of age (median 7 years 0 month). Method: Left anterior descending artery flow velocity (LAD) (maximum (MAX) and mean), left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV), and left ventricular myocardial mass (MAS) were examined by echocardiography. We used Vivid I (GE Yokogawa medical systems, Tokyo) as the cardiac echo machine. From body weight and height, BSA, expected LVEDV, and expected MAS were calculated.[Results] Results are below. LAD (max) 36.4\u00b117.0cm/sec, LVEDV98.3\u00b1 63.9ml/BSA (45.9~302.4, (163.1\u00b180.2)% of normal), MAS 96.8\u00b1 61.9g/BSA, (42.6~197.3, (125.0\u00b153.4)% of normal), LAD (max) corrected by MAS (LAD (max) correct) 0.69\u00b10.77cm/sec/g. In 8 patients, LVEDV was over 120 % of normal. In this group, LAD (max) correct was 0.35\u00b10.25cm/sec/g. They ware smaller than in other 2 patients (2.04\u00b10.59cm/sec/g ) (p=0.0002). This suggests that PDA volume overload may make the decreasing of LAD flow corrected by MAS.[Conclusions] Peak LAD corrected by MAS was decreased depending on the increased LVEDV in patients of PDA.Background: The bidirectional Glenn shunt has used as an intermediate palliative step prior to the modified Fontan operation in patients with a univentricular heart with favorable results. However, the mortality rate is high in the developing country. This study sought to determine which factors influenced the mortality. Methods: Forty-five consecutive patients with a univentricular heart who underwent the bidirectional Glenn shunt between November 1994 and October 2006 were retrospective cohort studied. Clinical, echocardiographic, and catheterization data were reviewed. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard methods were used for survival analyses. Results: Median age at operation was 20 months (range 9 months to 19 years). Median follow-up time after surgery was 4 years (range 1 day to 11 years). Eleven patients (24%) were death during the follow-up period. The early mortality rate was 4 of 45 patients (8%). The 5-and 10-year actuarial survival rates in patients after bidirectional Glenn shunt were 73% \u2022 8% and 55% \u2022 17%. In a multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis, heterotaxy syndrome (Hazard ratio = 6.7, p = 0.04) and systemic right ventricle (Hazard ratio = 11.8, p = 0.009) were independent predictors of mortality. Age at operation, oxygen saturation, pulsatile Glenn shunt, pulmonary artery pressure, bilateral SVCs, and Nakata index were not predictive of mortality. Conclusion: Heterotaxy syndrome and systemic right ventricle were the greatest risk for death. The presence of heterotaxy syndrome and systemic right ventricle in patients with a univentricular heart should lead to aggressive investigation and management strategies.Keijiro Ibuki 1 , Keiichi Hirono 1 , Keiichiro Uese 1 , Kazuyoshi Saito 1 , Fukiko Ichida 1 , Toshio Miyawaki 1 , Shingo Ohtaka 2 , Junichiro Kitahara 2 , Hirohisa Murakami 2 , Naoki Yoshimura 2",

Purpose: The aim of this study is to assess the relationship between the severity of carotid atherosclerosis and Achilles tendon thickness (ATT) and Lp (a) in children with mutation of LDL-R gene. Subjects and Methods: Subjects were 21 familial hypercholesterolemia heterozygous children aged 12.8\u00b15.1 years from our outpatient clinic, who were identified LDL-R mutations by DGGE. Serum lipoproteins were determined by enzymatic method, and LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) was calculated by use of Friedewald formula. Lp (a) measured immunochemically. Achilles tendon thickness (ATT) was determined by radiographic method. Intima-media thickness (IMT) was measured by B-mode ultrasound. Results: Lp (a) varied from 4 to 113 mg/dl and was not age-depended in this series. The average\u00b1SD, ATT was 8.9\u00b13.5 mm, and the average IMT was 0.60\u00b1 0.12 mm. Lp (a) levels were positively related with ATT (r = 0.457, p=0.018), and with IMT (r = 0.392, p=0.023). Lp (a) also significantly associated with LDL-C levels, cumulatively (r = 0.277, p=0.005). Conclusions: The advanced atherosclerotic findings were notified in children with mutation of LDL-R gene who are accompanied with high Lp (a) levels. These findings may be compatible with the fact that adult patients with high Lp (a) levels frequently affected CHD. Lp (a) measurement may help to manage the children with mutation of LDL-R gene.Hirotaka Ohki 1 , Rina Chinen 1 , Megumi Matsuoka 1 , Kazuki Kouno 1 , Shigeki Yoshiba 1 , Masaru Miura 1 , Masaaki Satou 1 , Hiroyuki Yamagishi 2 1 Tokyo Metropolitan Kiyose Children's Hospital, Department of Cardiology, 2 Keio University, Department of Pediatrics [Background] Clinical features of children with cardiomyopathy remain to be clarified for the better treatments and outcomes of patients.

The causes of about half cases were unknown. The most common causes were myocarditis in DCM, CMS (Noonan syndrome) in HCM, and familial cases were rare. The prognosis of IEM and infant cases with HCM was particularly poor.Saranwan Phetpisal, Somkiat Soponthammarak, Suppalak PutthalakPrince of Songkhla University, Department of Paediatrics Background: Head-up tilt testing is a widely used method for eliciting syncope of vagal in origin in children and adolescent with unexplained syncope. Although, it is widely used clinically to confirm the diagnosis of new cardiac syncope in children, its diagnostic value is still uncertain. This study was undertaken to assess the diagnostic value of head-up tilt testing with the use of sublingual nitroglycerin. Methods: Twenty three patients (mean age 10.7 + 2.9) with a typical history of neurocardiogenic syncope and 15 healthy controls (mean age 11.5 + 2.5) were studied. The patients and the controls were tilted upright to 70 degree for 20 minutes. If syncope did not occur, sublingual Conclusions: Our findings show that the childhood hypertension is strongly associated with BMI and other BMI related factors. This observation is consistent with previous reportsshowing that an overexpression of Tbx5 results in decrease in cell proliferation in the developing heart.

ABCA3 is highly expressed in lamellar body membranes in alveolar type II cells in human and mouse lung.

Our RNA microarray analysis demonstrated that lipid metabolism related genes were decreased in type II cells from Stat3 \u2206/\u2206\u0323 mice (unpublished observation). Because ABCA3 plays an important role in surfactant lipid homeostasis, the present study was undertaken to assess the role of Stat3 in the regulation of ABCA3 in alveolar type II cells. Method: Stat3 \u2206/\u2206\u0323 mice were generated in which Stat3 was selectively deleted in respiratory epithelial cells. ABCA3 mRNA and protein were assessed in Stat3 \u2206/\u2206\u0323 and control mice. Results: ABCA3 mRNA and immunostaining were significantly decreased in alveolar type II cells in the lungs of Stat3 \u2206/\u2206\u0323 mice. The deletion of Stat3 was associated with abnormalities in the numbers and sizes of lamellar bodies in alveolar type II cells.

We determine whether the polymorphisms of the MDR1 gene are associated with the development of childhood ALL. Methods: The MDR1 gene polymorphisms, -2352G>A, -934A>G, -692T>C (5' regulatory region) and 3435C>T (exon 26), were examined in 157 ALL patients and 96 healthy children. The amounts of MDR1 mRNA were quantified in 54 healthy individuals using normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells to evaluate the effect of each polymorphism on the gene expression. Results: The frequency of the G/G genotype of the -2352 G>A was significantly higher in ALL than in controls (74/109 vs. 52/96, p=0.04). The frequency of the T/T genotype of the 3435C>T was also significantly higher in ALL (29/118 vs. 10/96, p=0.006). In a haplotype analysis using the 5' regulatory sites, the frequency of a certain haplotype was higher in ALL than in controls (59/90 vs. 42/88, p= 0.048). When the -2352G>A was examined in different age groups, patients aged six or older were found to have the G/G genotype more frequently than the controls (42/51 vs. 52/96, p=0.0014), while no difference was observed in the younger age group. The amounts of MDR1 mRNA were significantly higher in either G/G or G/A genotype of the -2352 G>A than in A/A genotype (p=0.04).

NQO1 contributes to p53 protein stability through regulating 20S proteasome pathway. Poor induction of p53 in NQO1 null mice has been reported. These observations lead us to investigate whether NQO1 status is correlated to p53 expression level, playing some roles in the induction of MLL gene rearrangement by etoposide.[Methods] We genotyped germ line NQO1 allele in Epstein-Barr virus transformed lymphoblastoid cell line (EB-LCL) derived from 7 infants who developed acute leukemia. p53 induction after 5Gy irradiation (IR) and MLL gene cleavage by etoposide was also analyzed using EB-LCL with various NQO1 SNPs status.[Results] We identified one heterozygote and one homozygote of C609T, and one heterozygote of C465T in EB-LCLs derived from 7 patients. C609T homozygote showed normal p53 induction in response to IR. On the other hand, C465T heterozygote displayed significantly lower p53 induction. There was no association of NQO1 SNPs with the susceptibility to MLL gene cleavage by etoposide.[Conclusion] NQO1 deficiency identified in C465T, but not that in C609T, was associated with defective p53 induction. Thus NQO1 deficiency by itself may not play direct role for leukemogenesis, but C465T may underlie leukemia susceptibility through defective p53 response by unknown mechanisms. Further studies are needed to identify the possible role of NQO1 polymorphisms for the susceptibility to MLL rearrangement in infant leukemia.Tomohei Nakao 1 , Takashi Fukushima 1 , Takashi Shimizu 2 , Ryoko Nakajima 1 , Wataru Murofushi 5 , Toru Nanmoku 3 , Keiko Oki 3 , Kazumi Suzukawa 4 , RyoSumazaki 1 Department of Pediatric Health, Graduate School of Comprehensive Human Sciences, Medical Sciences for Control of Pathological Processes, University of Tsukuba, 2 Department of Pediatrics, Tokai University School of Medicine, Department of Clinical Laborarory, University of Tsukuba Hospital, Department of Clinical Pathology, Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Tsukuba, 5 Department of Pediatrics, University of Tsukuba HospitalThe detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) is of great significance when pediatric hematologists follow leukemia patients for early detection of relapse. MRD was monitored in TEL-AML1 positive childhood ALL patients with three methods, PCR amplification of fusion transcripts, expression levels of Wilms' tumor gene (WT-1), and flow cytometric (FCM) detection of aberrant immunophenotypes. TEL-AML1 is a fusion transcript as a result of a fusion chimeric gene t(12,21)(p13;q22), which is known to be an indicator for favorable prognosis.

Genetic polymorphisms in folate pathway related enzymes including methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T and A1298C, methionine synthase (MTR) A2756G, thymidylate synthase (TS) 28-bp tandem repeat, and reduced folate carrier (RFC) G80A have been associated with increased susceptibility for several cancers. In the present casecontrol study we investigated, these polymorphisms in genomic DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells in 73 Thai children with various types of central nervous system tumors and in 205 age and sex matched controls. Thirty-one out of 73 patients were diagnosed with glial tumors (astrocytoma, oigodendroglioma, ependymoma), 28 with embryonal CNS tumors (medulloblastoma, pinealoblastoma, primitive neuroectodermal tumor), 13 with germ cell tumors and 1 with meningioma. We found that the homozygous CC allele of MTHFR A1298C conferred an increased risk to develop embryonal CNS tumors (OR 3.9; 95% CI 1.3-11.4, p = 0.02).

The median followup time was 14.5(6.9-42) mo. At the end of RT, 7 patients had partial response (PR), 4 stable disease, and 1 progressed. All magnetic resonance spectroscopy in 5 available patients showed decreased Choline:Creatine ratio. One-year progression free survival (PFS) was 41.7% with median progression time of 10.2\u00b13.0 mo (95%CI 4.2-16.1). One-year overall survival (OS) was 58.3% with median survival time (ST) of 13.5\u00b13.6 mo (95%CI 6.4-20.5). Patients with PR after RT had longer PFS than others (p=0.036). Patients whose age <5 yr had longer ST than \u22655 yr (p=0.036). Conclusion: Our approach demonstrated a better outcome than previous regimens. Patients whose age <5 yr is the prognostic indicator for better ST including 1 patient who survives >3 yrs. In the future, protracted low dose TMZ with other biological agent should be investigated to determine an even better outcome.

These two diseases should be differentially diagnosed each other for planning of adequate treatment. <method> case report of clinical practice. <result> Case 1: Twelve-month-old girl. Watery diarrhea and fever began 1 week prior to admission. On admission there were abdominal spotted eczema, cephalic seborrheic dermatitis, cervical and abdominal lymphoadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, cytopenia, hypofibrinogenemia, hypoalbuminemia, hyperferritinemia, and skull punched out lesion. Skin and liver biopsies showed Langerhans histiocytes, while the bone marrow examination revealed massive hemophagocytosis.This child died at age 21 months, in spite of intensive chemotherapy. Both Langerhans cells and hemophagocytic macrophages infiltrated into bone marrow, lymphnodes, spleen and liver at an autopsy. Case2: Fourteen-month-old girl. Spotted eczema began 1 month prior to admission. One week before, she expressed unusual fatigue. On admission there wre cephalic seborrheic dermatitis, petechiae and protrude dark red eczema in head and body, cervical lymphoadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, anemia(Hb 2.1g/dl), metabolic acidosis, and cosciousness disorder. Skin biopsy revealed Langerhans histiocytes infiltration, whereas bone marrow contained hemophagocytic non-Langerhans histiocytes. This child responded to chemotherapy. Two months after diagnosis, she had no evidence of LCH and HLH except a punched out resion of illium. <conculsion> Two types of histiocytic disorders were diagnosed in each case, LCH and HLH. We got biopsy samples from two or more organs, and histopathologically examined with immunostaining.

Meanwhile, second/new malignancy has become a problem arising in the long-term survivors. BMT from a histocompatible sibling donor is the first line treatment of severe aplastic anemia (SAA) children. Non-irradiated conditioning has been preferably employed concerning the late effects on the growth and fertility, and the risk of malignancy. Reduced intensity conditioning raises the risk of graft failure and/or mixed donor chimerism that involves incomplete hematological recovery and clonal diseases. We have no information of solid malignancy in SAA survivors in Japan who underwent allogeneic BMT at <15 years of age. [Case Reports and Results] We present a 13-year-old boy who developed malignant liver tumor. At 3 years of age, this patient underwent a histocompatible sibling donor BMT (infused cell number 4.6x10 7 /kg) for idiopathic SAA, after a conditioning with antithymocyte globulin (10 mg/kg) and cyclophosphamide (200 mg/kg). He became a hepatitis B virus carrier after BMT. Stable mixed chimerism (donor: 65~70%), mild thrombocytopenia and no active hepatitis allowed his active school life. At age 13, abdominal pain was a sign of massive tumor. Extremely high levels of \u03b1-fetoprotein (1,650,000 ng/ml) indicated the clinical diagnosis of hepatoblastoma that might be the first report as post-BMT malignancy. The necropsy specimens revealed that the tumor was recipient cell-origin and showed the histopathological features of both hepatoblastoma and hepatocellular carcinoma.[Conclusions] Prolonged mixed chimerism and hepatitis virus infection might induce a rare oncogenesis after non-irradiated conditioning.P-137New treatment strategy against malignant tumors-A vaccine with human umbilical vein endotherial cells and very low dose IL-2Tetsuya Nishimura 1 , Hirotsugu Kano 1 , Tomoaki Ando 1 , Naoko Ito 1 , Hajime Nishimoto 1 , Masaru Takamizawa 1 , Tsutomu Iwata 2 , Takashi Igarashi 1 University of Tokyo,department of Pediatrcs, 2 Tokyo Kasei University [Background] Most of immunotherapy against a patient with malignant tumor have been deveroped as a target of tumor specific antigen,however,their effect were not more than expected.

Progressive iron overload is the life-limiting complication commonly found in thalassemic patients. The assessment of body iron stores is essential for determining the need and efficacy of iron chelation. The parameters of serum iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), and serum ferritin were studied in 79 children with thalassemia diseases. The ages ranged from 1 to 17 years with a mean of 7 years and 10 months. Neither of them had clinical symptoms of hepatitis. The correlation between transferrin saturation (TS = serum iron/TIBC x 100) and serum ferritin was shown in the equation of TS = 10.253. ln (ferritin) (r = 0.956, p = 0.000). For example, TS = 70.83% indicates serum ferritin of 1,000 ng/ml. Thus, where serum ferritin is not feasible but serum iron and TIBC are available, TS can be used to estimate the level of serum ferritin. Therefore, the assessment of iron stores and monitoring of iron chelation in thalassemic patients can be effectively achieved.Suradej Hongeng, Chokdee Vongbhorrisut, Sinee Disthabanchong, Samart Pakakasama, Nongnuch Sirachainan, Ampaiwan Chuansumrit, Pat Mahachoklertwattana, Boonsong Ongphiphadhanakul, Rajata Rajatanavin",

Recent studies suggest that osteoblastic cells lining the bone surface are a key component of the hematopoietic niche to promote and regulate HSCs. Anatomical architecture of BM could be regenerated by culturing mesenchymal stem cells on the hydroxyapatite (HA) scaffold. In the present study, we examined whether the regenerated BM has the ability to support HSCs. Methods: 1) BM stromal cells from C57/BL6 mice were cultured on the HA scaffold with numerous small pores for 3 days and the scaffold with attached cells was implanted subcutaneously onto the back of C57/BL6 recipient mice. 2) Lineage negative (Lin-) BM cells transduced with a lentiviral vector containing the luciferase (Luc) gene were intravenously administered into the recipient mice after lethal irradiation. 3) After 8 weeks, the scaffolds were removed and re-transplanted into the lethally irradiated second recipient mice along with normal BM cells. Results: In the secondary transplanted mice, Luc+hematopoitic cells were detected on the scaffolds by in vivo bioluminescence imaging for at lease 3 months after transplantation. Bioluminescence signals were also detected on the whole body including the head, extremities, chest, and abdomen after G-CSF injection. Conclusions: The regenerated BM on the HA scaffold is capable of maintain hematopoiesis in vivo suggesting that the functional niche is reconstituted. Expansion of hematopoietic cells in the regenerated BM may be useful for treatment of various hematopoietic diseases.Yuki Enomoto 1 , Takashi Fukushima 1 , Takashi Shimizu 2 , Ryoko Nakajima 1 , Tomohei Nakao 1 , Ryo Sumazaki 1 Department of Pediatrics, Tsukuba University Hospital, 2 Department of Pediatrics, Tokai University Hostpital[Background] The aim of this study was to assess the safety and the humoral response to inactivated trivalent split influenza vaccine in children with cancer and aplastic anemia.[Methods] In autumn, 2005 and/or 2006, 23 children with various types of malignancies and aplastic anemia were received one or two dose of influenza vaccine 2-4 weeks apart. Hemagglutinin-inhibition (HI) antibody titers were determined in paired sera obtained just before and after influenza vaccination. Effective immune responses were measured as four-fold or more rises in HAI titers.[Results] Influenza vaccine was administered to all children without any serious adverse effects. Children on chemotherapy showed lower immune response to both influenza A and B than those having completed chemotherapy. No children with aplastic anemia receiving immunosuppressive agent had four-fold rises HAI titers [Conclusions] Influenza vaccine was safe for children with cancer or aplastic anemia. Vaccination after completing chemotherapy was followed by sufficient elevation of antibody titers, whereas patients got an insufficient immune responses under administration of therapeutic agents.",

Methods: Childhood ALL patients who had been diagnosed during [1987] [1988] [1989] [1990] [1991] [1992] [1993] [1994] [1995] [1996] [1997] [1998] [1999] [2000] [2001] [2002] [2003] [2004] and completion of treatment for at least 6 months. The oral glucose tolerance test and lipid screening were performed. Impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes were defined according to WHO criteria. Common polymorphisms of TCF7L2 were genotyped and assessed their effect on \u03b2-cell function and insulin sensitivity. Results: 110 children were included in this study (45 females and 65 males; age 4-20 yr). 101 children (91.8%) had normal glucose tolerance (NGT). The others (8.2%) had impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) which associated to older age at test (13.7 and 10.3 yrs, p = 0.006), longer period of completion of treatment (47 and 26 months, p = 0.003), and lower value of insulin sensitivity indicies (WBISI) (5.82 and 9.56, p = 0.001) than children in NGT group. The typical signs of metabolic syndromes (hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL-C, obesity) were found up to 20%. The genotypes of TCF7L2 were not difference between NGT and IGT group (p=1). Conclusion: Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) related to longer period of completion of treatment and older age group. Long-term survivors of childhood ALL had potential risk of impaired \u03b2-cell function and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), even in non-obese children. Our findings did not support association of TCF7L2 variants with insulin resistance (\u03b2-cell dysfunction) in childhood ALL survivors These enzymes may also be potentially important for dissemination and tissue invasion of malignant lymphocytes. We examine, in this study, the correlation of MMP and TIMP gene expression in leukemia cells with the clinical characteristics of infants with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), especially with the extramedullary organ involvement. Methods: The mRNA contents of MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 in leukemia cells from 33 infants with infant ALL were quantified at initial presentation by the real time quantitative RT-PCR (TaqMan methods). The association between their expression and patient clinical characteristics was examined, including patients' age and white blood cell count at diagnosis, MLL gene rearrangement in leukemia cells, and presence of hepatosplenomegaly or central nervous system (CNS) involvement. Results: The mRNA contents of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were not associated with any patient characteristics. The MMP-2/TIMP-1 and MMP-2/TIMP-2 ratios were significantly higher in patients with hepatosplenomegaly than those without it (p=0.005 and 0.009). The MMP-2/TIMP-2 ratio was also higher in patients with CNS involvement (p=0.012). The MMP-9/TIMP-1 and MMP-9/TIMP-2 ratios did not associate with the organ involvement. Conclusions: The MMP/TIMP balance, but not the mRNA amounts of a single gene, may play an important role in dissemination and organ invasion of leukemia cells in infant ALL.",

The newly available LightCycler \u00ae system has been used for rapid PCR, while simultaneously quantifying and analyzing the amplification results. We tried to apply the LightCycler \u00ae system to the diagnosis of Japanese-type (type 2) adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) deficiency in two families with 2,8-dihydroxyadenine urolithiasis.[Cases] The first patient was a 3-year-old girl who presented with left flank pain. The second patient was a 2-year-old girl who presented with complaints of sudden dysuria.The spectrophotometric analysis of the stone fragments revealed an absorption spectrum for 2,8-DHA. Results of Gene Analysis: We used the LightCycler \u00ae system to detect APRT*J and the PCR-SSCP method to detect APRT*Q0. The first patient was homozygous for APRT*J/APRT*J and the second patient was compound heterozygous for APRT*J/APRT*Q0.[Disccusion] The analysis of the APRT gene is the most reliable diagnostic method in infants. Major problems with the present PCR-SSCP method, however, are that it reguire multiple manual step, and it takes a very long time before the detection can be confirmed. Meanwhile, the analysis of the APRT gene using the LightCycler \u00ae system can provide mutation results within approximately 30 minutes after DNA isolation, and the results are easily and clearly visualized. The genetic diagnosis of APRT deficiency using this system may be useful not only as a diagnostic test for infants with known 2,8-DHA, but also as a screening of infants with a suspicion of urolithiasis.",

CT brain showed generalized cerebral edema and hypodense lesions in thalamus, brainstem and basal ganglia. The picture is compatible with acute necrotizing encephalopathy reference 3 frequently reported in Japan. Conclusion: Combining previous findings, incidence of INCs was ~240 per 100,000 person-years in HK. The discrepancy between HK and USA is at least partly attributable to different admission threshold for influenza-related illnesses and FSs. INC data from Japan will be of great interest if inter-ethnic difference in the neurotropic effect of influenza is to be explored.P-163 CYP2C19 polymorphisms as a predictor of adverse effects of clobazam Background: Clobazam (CLB) is effective in treating intractable epilepsy, but with occasional adverse effects that often require dose decrease or termination. CLB is metabolized to N-desmethyl CLB (N-CLB) by CYP3A4, and then to an inactive metabolite by CYP2C19. We have previously shown that 1) the ratio of serum levels of N-CLB to CLB was increased in patients with two mutated CYP2C19 alleles, 2) patients co-medicated with CYP3A4 inducer showed lower CLB concentration/dose. Purpose: To examine effects on occurrence of adverse effects of CLB of the number of mutated alleles of CYP2C19 and co-medication with CYP3A4 inducer(s). Methods: 41 patients with intractable epilepsy who had been on multiple AED; between the age of 3 to 38 years; 22 males and 19 females. Median CLB administration duration was 36.6 months (range; 8 to 58 months). Results: In 11 patients it was necessary to reduce the dose of or discontinue CLB due to severe adverse effects. Of those 11 patients, 3 are among 17 with no mutant alleles (3/17 or 18%), 3 among 16 with one mutant allele (19%), and 5 among 8 with two mutant alleles (63%). The most sever adverse effects were observed in 3 patients; those patients had either one or two mutant alleles, and all were co-medicated with CYP3A4 inducer. Conclusion: Patents with two mutant alleles of CYP2C19 are more likely to develop sever adverse effects, particularly when co-medicated with CYP3A4 inducer(s), which may lead to discontinuation or reduction in dosage of CLB.",

Method: The proband was a Japanese 12-year-old boy, who experienced his first attack of paralysis at the age of one year. Thereafter, paralytic attacks intermittently recurred a few times per day, each lasting for several minutes to an hour. The weakness most often appeared during a rest after strenuous exercise, and repeated exercise alleviated the weakness. After informed consent was obtained, we analyzed exons 9, 13, 14, 19, 22, 23 and 24 of SCN4A, the regions of SCN4A containing mutations in hyperkalemic PP patients reported previously, using PCR and direct sequencing. Results: We detected a missense mutation in exon 13 (c.2375T\u2192G, V792G) of the maternal origin and a one-base deletion in exon 24 (c.4677delC, P1560fsX1650) of the paternal origin in the heterozygous form in the proband and his younger brother. Discussion: We have identified biallelic heterozygous novel muations V792G and P1560fsX1650 in the SCN4A gene in siblings with hyperkalemic PP. Their mother and five her relatives had the same symptoms, while their father had severe stiff shoulders but no paralytic attack. The phenotype of the siblings appeared to be caused by not the P1560fsX1650 mutation, but the V792G mutation, located at the sixth transmembrane segment of domain 2 of SCN4A. There are only a few study in Thailand and lack of complete data collection system. Objectives: To study the epidemiologic data of child abuse case for creating an optimized prototype for data collection system at the emergency room. Methods: The medical records of child abuse cases attended in the emergency room at Ramathibodi Hospital between Jan 2001 to Dec 2004, were retrospectively reviewed. The demographic data included age, sex, type of abuse, abuser, sender, education, sibling and order, family member, parent's career, family relationship, substance abuse in family and socioeconomic status. Then the multivariate analyses were used for determining the correlation of each variable. Results: One hundred child abuse cases (84 females, 16 males) with a mean age of 9 years, were enrolled in the study. The child abuse was defined as sexual abuse (60%) and physical abuse (40%). The prevalence of sexual abuse was gradually increased form 6 cases in the year 2001 to 9, 22 and 23 in the year 2002, 2003 and 2004 respectively. The multivariate analyses revealed that there was no statistically significant correlation between the sexual/physical abuse and all variables. This may be explained by a rather small sample size. However, the computerized data collection system for child abuse has been created.",

We are trying to prevent and detect anorexia nervosa early by using growth curves and pulse rates in school. Methods: Since 2001, based on the physical measurement values of the girl students in the health examinations conducted twice a year in two private junior high schools, we have collected those who fall under the following conditions: (1) downward shift of weight by 1 channel and more on a growth curve and the degree of obesity \u2264-15%;(2) weight loss of \u22653 kg. Among these students, when bradycardia (heart rate \u226460/min) or amenorrhea is detected, we refer them to medical institutions. Results: Twenty students were referred to medical institutions, and 19 of them except one consulted a doctor. Among these 19 students, 2 were diagnosed as underweight, 17 as anorexia nervosa. In these two schools, we have performed early interventions before the level of emaciation reaches to a severe condition. Therefore, progressive anorexia nervosa has not been detected since our screening program was launched. Conclusions: When weight loss or poor weight gain on a growth curve are observed based on the physical measurement values, and bradycardia or amenorrhea is detected, the possibility of a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa should be considered, and early close examination is required.",

Its prevalence has been reported as 3-20% in other countries but its prevalence has not been studied in our region. Objectives: To study the prevalence and distribution of subtypes of ADHD in primary school children in Hat Yai, southern Thailand. Method: A cross-sectional study was performed in first grade Hat Yai students from 15 primary schools using the Conners' Abbreviated Parent/Teacher Questionnaires. Children with positive scores ( > 12) and their parents were randomized and interviewed by a pediatric psychiatrist using DSM IV. Result: 2,539 questionnaires were sent out of which 2,293 (90.3%) were returned. 1,479(90.7%) of the students were from private schools and 814(89.5%) from public schools. The age range was 4.0-9.9 years with a mean of 7.8+0.5 years. 794 children (34.6%) tested positive for ADHD, of whom 198 were interviewed with their parents to confirm the ADHD diagnosis. 46 were proven to have ADHD, giving a prevalence of 8.0%. The prevalences in private and public schools were not significantly different (7.6% vs. 8.1%, p=0.3). The male to female ratio was 2.5:1. Hyperactive, inattentive, and combined subtypes were found to be 2.1%, 3.1% and 2.8%, respectively. (p=0.9). Conclusions:. The prevalence of ADHD among school children in southern Thailand was 8% and males predominated. The distribution of the 3 major subtypes was similar. Results: Of the total sample, 2,236/3,692 (60.6%) shared a bed with their parents, and 39.3% shared a room but slept in a different bed. Sixty percent of the parents place their infants to sleep in a supine position, 32.2% place on their side and 4.9% in a prone position. Bed sharing was associated with older maternal age, higher parental education and with professional careers. Places the infants to sleep in a non-supine position was associated with older maternal age, higher parental education, higher income, professional careers, and with infant birth weight of > 2,500 gm. Conclusions: Bed sharing is more common in Thai neonates than has been reported from other countries, but rates of sleeping in the non-supine positions are comparable. The main factor associated with bed sharing as well as putting infants to sleep in the non-supine positions was a higher parental socioeconomic status (SES), in contrast to previous studies in which both are associated with low maternal SES.",

In this study, there were four conditions of reach-to-grasp movement: large target with visual feedback (VL), small target with visual feedback (VS), large target with non-visual feedback (NL), and small target with non-visual feedback (NS) conditions to investigate the effects of visual condition and target size. A counterbalanced repeated measure was designed. Ten children with high functioning autism (HFA) and 10 normal subjects were matched according to age and handedness. Qualisys motion analysis system was used to capture the reachto-grasp movement. Kinematic data such as movement time (MT), peak velocity (PV), normalized jerk score (NJS), movement unit (MU), maximal grip aperture (MGA), normalized maximal grip aperture (NMGA) and so on were analyzed. The results of kinematic performance showed that children with HFA have larger MU (which represented for motor facileness) than controls in VS condition, but no differences between two groups in VL condition were found. In non-visual feedback condition, children with HFA also demonstrated significantly longer MT, larger NJS (which represented for motor smoothness) and more MU than controls, especially while the target was small.This study suggested that children with HFA have problems on motor smoothness and coordination in the process of the reach-to-grasp movement, especially in non-visual feedback and small target condition which suggested that children with HFA depend more visual cuing on performing prehension tasks and demonstrate poor coordination in high accuracy tasks. Intervention: Subjects were randomized into refrigerated and room temperature needle group prior to injection of DPT Outcome Measures: The effectiveness of refrigerated needles and room temperature needles were compared in terms of pain reduction using the Wong Baker Faces Pain Scale. The heart rate, blood pressure and oxygen saturation before, during and after the vaccination were the secondary outcome measures. Results: The increase in heart rate, increase in blood pressure and decrease in oxygen saturation from baseline, during and after vaccination among treatment groups were statistically insignificant (p-values 0.128, 0.209, and 1.00, respectively). The pain scores from the two groups showed marginally statistically significant result (p-value 0.055). Fifty-two percent of subjects in room temperature needle group have 0-1 pain score compared to forty-two percent with refrigerated needles. However, it is significant to note that with pain scores of 4-5, the room temperature needle group showed a higher percentage of 36.5% compared to 26.9% in refrigerated needles. Reported adverse events were redness for both needle groups. Blanching was noted with room temperature needle group. Conclusion: The use of refrigerated needles does not decrease the pain associated with DPT vaccination in 4-6 year-old children as compared with room temperature needles. Jikei University School of medicine, Department of Pediatrics, 2 Mie National Hospital, 3 Inje University Background: Use of aminophylline is an additional treatment for acute exacerbation of asthma is controversial .IV aminophylline is a \"classical\" bronchodilator but may have therapeutic advantages in its putative antiinflammatory effect and availability to peripheral airways where inhaled drugs may inadequately reach at. Objective: To assess if the addition of aminophylline infusion to standard treatment for acute exacerbation of asthma would enhance the recovery without serious adverse events. Methods: Children aged 2 to 15 years with acute asthma who did not respond to repeated inhalations of \u03b22 agonists were enrolled. All subjects were treated with inhaled salbutamol and methylprednisolone/hydrocortisone infusion and were randomized to receive additional aminophylline infusion(Group A) or none (Group B).Asthma symptom score and wheezing on auscultation were compared. Results: Fifty subjects were enrolled with 26 randomly allocated to group A and 24 to group B. The groups were well matched at baseline. One in group A and 7 in B dropped out because of exacerbation or non-compliance and outcome was analyzed in 24 from A and 17 from B. Faster improvement in symptoms were seen in Group A and there was a significant difference in symptom score at 24 hours after treatment between the groups(p<0.05).The time to resolution of wheezing was significantly shorter in Group A than in B(p<0.01). Four minor adverse events were observed in Group A but all completed the treatment. Conclusion: Our results showed that an addition of aminophylline may be a beneficial therapeutic option for children with acute asthma.",

VCP after open-heart surgery subsided spontaneously in 8 of 11 patients (6 were fully, 2 were partially) by 6 months after the surgery. However in 3 patients, VCP did not subside by 14 to 53 months after the surgery; a case received tracheostomy at 5 months after surgery as the severity of symptoms.[Conclusions] Our observation suggests that we can predict the prognosis of VCP after open-heart surgery at 6 months after the surgery.
