SIR model is one of the classical epidemic models with compartment structure, suitable for the transmission of infectious diseases that confer long-lasting immunity such as chicken pox and SARS. The host population is divided into three epidemiological groups: the susceptibles, the infectives, and the removed/recovered. The transmission dynamics of an infectious disease is described by modeling the population movements among those epidemiological compartments.",

Allen et al. have studied some discrete-time SI, SIR, and SIS epidemic models, compared the dynamics of deterministic and stochastic discrete-time epidemic models, and also applied the discrete epidemic model to the spread of rabies [1\u20133]. Allen and Driessche have given the basic reproductive number for some discrete-time epidemic models [4]. Castillo-Chavez and Yakubu have investigated a discrete SIS model with complex dynamics [5]. Zhou et al. have formulated and discussed the dynamical behavior of age-structured SIS models [6, 7]. A stage-structured model, a discrete epidemic model with seasonal variation in environment, a discrete tuberculosis transmission model, and many other discrete epidemic models have been constructed, studied, and applied [8\u201310]. One reason for the upsurge of discrete epidemic models is that discrete models have advantages in describing an infectious disease since epidemic data are usually collected in discrete time units, which would make it more convenient to use discrete-time models [11].",

The results on the global stability of the endemic equilibrium are quite few for discrete epidemic models due to the following two factors: (1) There is not enough effective theory and methods for global stability of discrete dynamical systems; (2) The discrete model exhibits much more complicated dynamical behaviors than its corresponding continuous model.",

In addition to the death and recruitment, there are population movements among those three epidemiological compartments from time unit t to time t+1. We assume that the recruited individuals (by birth and immigration) are constant and enter the susceptible compartment. After one unit time, the susceptible individuals may stay in the susceptible compartment, or get infected and move to the infectious compartment, or die. The individuals in the infective compartment can keep being the infective, or get recover and transfer to the recovered compartment, or die.

Although R0\u2208(1,1.7) does not satisfy the conditions of Theorem 5, the numerical simulation shows that the endemic equilibrium of model (1) may still be globally asymptotically stable for R0\u2208(1,1.7).

If those two inequalities do not hold, then model (1) may exhibit much more complicated dynamical behaviors. The numerical simulation demonstrates that there exists a sequence of period-doubling bifurcation to chaos. Let us take \u03bc=0.01, \u03b3=0.001, \u03b4=0.001, and \u039b=20 to investigate the period doubling process of model (1). For small R0 (a linear function of \u03b2), the endemic equilibrium is unique and globally asymptotically stable (see Figure 2(a)). When R0 passes through 186.8, the endemic equilibrium losses its stability, and a stable periodic solution of period 2 appears (see Figure 2(b)). When R0 passes through 226.8, the periodic solution of period 2 losses its stability, and a stable periodic solution of period four appears (see Figure 2(c)). As R0 increases further, the periodic solution of period 4 becomes unstable, and a periodic solution of period 8 appears. The numerical simulation shows that the period-doubling bifurcation may continue and go to chaos (see Figure 2(d)). ",

The top left plot is the number of the susceptibles, S(t), which shows a slow downward tendency. From the demographic data in China, we know that the number of the population younger than twenty is 359 million in 2005, 320 million in 2009, and 302 million in 2010 [18, 20, 23]. The change of the host population in our simulation is consistent with the observed data. The top right is the number of the infective, I(t), which shows the slow upward tendency. The bottom left is the number of the recovered R(t). The curve in the bottom right plot is the number of new mumps infection cases from 2005 to 2015 by a model simulation. The piecewise curve with stars is the number of annually reported mumps cases out of notifiable infectious diseases from 2005 to 2011 [25].
