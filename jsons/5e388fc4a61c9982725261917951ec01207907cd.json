Our laboratory performed a series of virology and serology tests for SARS patients admitted to our hospital. Cross-reactivity was found when testing for antibody against human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) in one patient with SARS. Therefore, antibodies against HTLV were examined in paired-sera from 26 SARS patients. ELISA and a neutralization test were used to measure anti-SARS antibodies. Seroconversion for antibody against SARS-CoV was observed in all patients. Surprisingly, with the use of ELISA for HTLV, sera for 13 patients were positive for HTLV (50%), and seroconversion for HTLV was also observed in 10 patients (38.5%). Western blot for HTLV on those 26 paired-sera from 13 HTLVpositive patients displayed 5 positive results for HTLV-I, 7 positive results for HTLV-II, 1 positive result for both HTLV-I and II, 9 negative results for either HTLV-I or HTLV-II, and 4 ''indeterminate'' results. The findings that antibody to HTLV can be detected in blood samples collected from SARS patients provide important information for safe handling of blood products. Without such knowledge, blood products can be discarded mistakenly even though they contain anti-SARS-CoV antibodies that may be potentially valuable for SARS therapy.",

SARS originated from Southern China and then spread to many countries and regions, including Taiwan [Chan et al., 2004] . The latter experienced a SARS outbreak from March to June of 2003 and suffered from 680 probable cases of SARS with 81 confirmed deaths [Wu et al., 2004] . In our hospital, a 23-year-old patient recovered from SARS and was ready for discharge on the 17th day after the onset of the disease. This patient donated blood for research use. For biosafety reasons, a series of routine tests were conducted to detect antibodies against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human hepatitis B, C virus (HBV, HCV), and human Tcell lymphotropic virus (HTLV). The result was HTLV positive by HTLV ELISA kit (Murex HTLV I\u00feII, Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, IL). At the time of sera collection, antibody to SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was also detected in the serum of this patient. An earlier serum collected from the same patient on the 3rd day after disease onset was retested, and it was found that the results were negative for both SARS-CoV and HTLV antibodies. The results suggested that anti-SARS antibodies might recognize HTLV antigens. We therefore examined the antibody responses using sera from additional 25 SARS patients.",

Reactivity against GD21 was found in all patients' second sera (except for serum No. 6-2) and first sera from patient No. 5, 7, 10. According to the seropositive definition described by the manufacturer (see Materials & Methods), the Western blotting for those 26 pairedsera from patient No. 1 to No. 13 displayed five positive for HTLV-I (serum No. 5-1, 5-2, 8-2, 9-2, and 12-2), seven positive for HTLV-II (serum No. 1-2, 3-2, 4-2, 7-1, 10-1, 10-2, and 11-2), one positive for both HTLV-I and II (serum No. 2-2), nine negative for either HTLV-I or II (serum No. 1-1, 2-1, 3-1, 4-1, 6-1, 8-1, 9-1, 12-1, and 13-1), and four for ''indeterminate'' (serum No. 6-2, 7-2, 11-1, and 13-2). Notably, in this HTLV Western blot assay, the intensity of the positive bands appeared in SARS patients were much weaker than those of truely HTLVinfected patients (in comparison with the positive controls in Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 2) .",

We retrieved and analyzed 6 SARS-CoV full genomes, as well as 15 HTLV full genomes (including 7 HTLV-I and 8 HTLV-II) from GenBank (as of May 2003). All the annotated coding sequences were cross-examined in searching for common peptides longer than six aminoacid residues between the SARS-CoV and HTLV. Four common peptides were found and listed in Table II . Among these, ''RFPNITN'' is located on the spike protein (S) of SARS-CoV and on the envelope protein (env) of HTLV-I, while ''LALLLL'' is located on the nucleocapsid protein (N) of SARS-CoV and on the envelope protein of HTLV-II. These four common peptides were synthesized and tested the cross-reactivity of antibodies in the sera of SARS versus HTLV-infected patients. Figure 2A shows the purities of the synthesized peptides conjugated with ovalbumin. In a preliminary analysis, one HTLV-infected patient was recruited in addition and one serum (second serum from patient No. 5 or serum No. 5-2) was selected from those SARS patients described earlier, for testing their sera using the synthe-sized peptides. Negative sera provided by HTLV kit for control were also included. As shown in Figure 2B , serum from both the SARS patient and from the HTLV patient can react with the common peptides by Western blot, while no reactivity was found in the control serum.",

Cross-examining the coding sequences for both pathogens revealed four common peptides, which might be responsible for the false positive results described. These four common peptides were synthesized further and tested for crossreactivity of antibodies in the sera of SARS versus HTLV infected-patients. The results show that both sera from either HTLV or SARS patient can react with these four synthetic peptides (Fig. 2B ). Since only one serum from HTLV and one for SARS-CoV infected patient was tested, the result obtained in this study is considered very preliminary. The viral spike protein, nucleocapsid protein, and envelope protein in many viruses are considered to possess antigenicity for serum antibodies. From Figure 1 , it was noticed that only certain proteins were responsible for the cross-reactivity observed, for example, rgp46-1 for HTLV-I, rgp46-2 for HTLV-II, and GD21, p19, and p24 for both. Among the four common peptides being synthesized and tested, it was noticed that both ''LALLLL'' and ''RFPNITN'' are part of the transmembrane glycoprotein gp21, which is located next to GP46 on the product ''env,'' according to Gen-Bank annotations. Moreover, ''ALETPV'' is part of the major core protein p19, which is located next to p24 on the product ''gag''. Although it is not known whether the commercially used labels ''GD21'' and ''rgp46'' are synonyms to ''gp21'' and ''GP46'' we have found from GenBank annotations, it appears that these found common peptides are correlated to the displayed bands responsible for such cross-reactivity.",
