            "text": "The woman, who had 16 years history of SLE, had been receiving oral prednisone 7.5 mg/day since the diagnosis. On 10 January 2020, she spent 1 hour singing and dancing in a room. Later, one of her partners was diagnosed with COVID-19. In the next 10 days, she did not have contact with any suspected or confirmed patients. On 20 January 2020, she came back to her parents' home and never went out after that. Owing to the severity of COVID-19, 'level one response to major public health emergencies' was carried out in a Chinese province on 23 January 2020. Therefore, she was home quarantined and observed for 14 days. She was feeling good and did not have shortness of breath, fever or cough during the isolation period. Therefore, on 6 February 2020, she was released from the quarantine. However, just a day later, she started to have runny nose, a mild cough and nasal congestion with no fever. She did not pay much attention to these symptoms and did not consider further medical help. Seven days later, her symptoms improved. On 28 February 2020, she was hospitalised for screening as her father was diagnosed with COVID-19. Routine blood examination was found to be abnormal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was above normal. The SARS-CoV2 nuclei acid test from nasopharyngeal swabs was found to be negative, however, her IgG and IgM antibodies were positive. Lung CT revealed multiple lesions in both lungs. Based on these test results, she was diagnosed with COVID-19.",

Nasopharyngeal swab virus nucleic acid tests performed on 2 February 2020 and 3 March 2020 were found to be negative. On 5 March 2020, her lung CT deteriorated, and ground-glass opacity changes were noted in the right upper lung. She was administered extra piperacillin sodium, tazobactam sodium and then glycyrrhizin. The lung CT showed improvements, and on 9 March 2020, she was discharged.",
