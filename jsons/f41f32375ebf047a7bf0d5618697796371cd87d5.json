On admission he complained of right knee swelling and difficulty in 59 bearing weight on that limb. His past medical history included severe chronic obstructive pulmonary 60 disease (COPD), chronic kidney disease with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 32 ml/min, 61 transient ischaemic stroke, ischemic heart disease and atrial fibrillation. His ambulation was limited 62 by shortness of breath and his mobility was mainly limited to domiciliary activity.63 On the second day of his admission, a postural hypotension and concomitant drop in the 64 haemoglobin level were recognised. A computed tomography (CT) of his chest, abdomen and pelvis 65 was performed to identify a potential source of blood loss. The CT scan demonstrated haematoma in 66 the medial compartment of the right thigh. Subsequently, an arterial phase CT scan of the lower 67 limbs identified a 6.3 cm ruptured PAA (P1 segment of the right popliteal artery) with distal 68 thrombosis and with a significant haematoma in the medial and posterior thigh compartments 69 (Figure 1). He was also diagnosed with an incidental 47 mm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. 70 The patient was promptly referred to the vascular surgeons. 71 On assessment by the vascular surgeons, the patient appeared frail, with shortness of breath at rest 72 (saturation on room air was 95%), complaining of rest pain in the right foot and in the thigh. The 73 right foot was viable though with reduced sensation and motor function (IIB Rutherford 74 classification). He also had extensive swelling of the thigh and bruising involving the medial and 75 posterior aspect of the right thigh. A bed side arterial duplex scan confirmed absent flow distal to 76 the ruptured PAA. 77 than palliation) and, after a detailed discussion with him and his family (based on his extensive 80 medical background and frailty), an above knee amputation was carried out under spinal 81 anaesthesia. 82 He suffered a NSTEMI (non-ST elevation myocardial infarction) the following day, for which he was 83 treated in accordance with the local Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) protocol. ECG showed T wave 84 inversion in V4 to V6 leads and the high sensitivity troponin I level was 143 ng/l. Blood results also 85 revealed a white blood cell count (WBC) of 7.3 10*9/l, with lymphocyte count of 0.9 10*9/l and 86 normal neutrophil count. On the third day after his amputation, he developed signs of chest 87 infection including increased respiratory rate to 29 per minute and mild drop in oxygen saturation to 88 95%. Clinical examination revealed bibasal crepitations and chest radiography demonstrated fluid 89 overload and basal atelectasis. Repeated bloods displayed WBC of 6.7, with lymphocyte count of 0.6 90 and normal neutrophil count. Oxygen therapy was initiated along with Piperacillin/Tazobactam in 91 accordance with our local infectious disease guidelines and intravenous diuretic (Furosemide). His 92 condition started improving -respiratory rate returned to 18 per minute and his oxygen saturation 93 increased to 98% on room air after 24 hours of treatment. 94 On day five, he unexpectedly developed high temperature of 38.5 degrees of Celsius and new dry 95",
