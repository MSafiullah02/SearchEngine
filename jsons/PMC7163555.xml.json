But these benefits occasionally implicate damages and harms such as adverse effects of drugs, so that careful evaluation of the benefit\u2013risk ratio is required. Sometimes, however, the potential risks are difficult to estimate and thus difficult to manage. At the worst, this can result in wrong decisions and actions. A historical case is the \u2018swine flu affair\u2019 in 1976 [1]. For fear of a swine flu epidemic in the USA, an expensive national immunization was rashly mounted. As a result of severe adverse events, the campaign had to be prematurely suspended, and the tragedy was that there wasn't any sign of an epidemic. A reverse example is the contamination of blood products with HIV in the early 1980s [1]. The risk of AIDS for patients treated with blood products was underestimated or deliberately downplayed, resp.. As a result of carelessness, thousands of HIV infections unnecessarily occurred. These two cases illustrate that neither to go all the way nor to do nothing at all is wise.",

It has since flourished in international policy statements and agreements \u2013 initially recognized in the World Charter for Nature, which was adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1982; and subsequently adopted in the First International Conference on Protection of the North Sea in 1984. At the Second International Conference on Protection of the North Sea in 1987, the European so\u2010called \u2018generation target\u2019, i.e. the elimination by year 2020 of discharging hazardous chemicals into the North Sea, was defined.

According to this, experimentation should not proceed, if there is reasonable ground for concern (i.e. no evidence) that something might be harmful.

Trilucent\u2122 breast implants consist of a silicone elastomer shell with a lipid filler based on soybean oil and were for several years used as alternatives to silicone gel and saline filled breast implants. As a result of concerns of the Medical Device Agency (MDA) to long\u2010term safety data, the company voluntarily withdrew the product from the market in March 1999. The withdrawal was a precautionary measure until further information could be gathered about the biological safety and clinical experience with these implants. In May 2000, preliminary data of further analytical studies became available. The toxic degradation products found were considered as indication of the potentially hazardous nature of the filler and led to the MDA's Hazard Notice [HN2000(05)] with the recommendation to remove the Trilucent\u2122 breast implants. The company initiated a reimbursement program for the implant replacement, further a clinical sample study (results expected in 2004) and is planning a large epidemiological study over the period of 9 years. So far, the continued research on the safety revealed no indication of toxic effects in implanted women. In this case, the official application of the precautionary principle can be regarded adequate, because it did not damage and even promoted research.",

As recently published by Zanusso et al.

As long as a suitable screening test is not available, a first important preventive strategy is the exclusion of blood from donors who were exposed to a possible risk of infection. Thus, blood plasma from the UK must not be used in the manufacture of blood derivatives any longer. Furthermore, persons are excluded as potential blood donors who have spent a total of more than one year in the UK or Northern Ireland between 1980 and 1996. To expand the exclusion to individuals who have themselves received blood transfusion before is opined to be not acceptable in view of the prevailing blood shortage [56]. As a second measure, blood and cellular blood components have to be depleted from the \u2018buffy coat\u2019 (leucoreduction), to remove potentially present vCJD pathogens. Although the real effect of leucoreduction on TSE infectivity still has to be proven, the removal of leukocytes is anyway an advantage because of the adverse effects caused by leucocytes. Concerning plasma\u2010derived medicinal products, the manufacturing process should be optimized to the effect that the infectivity of plasma is further reduced as it is already indicated by available data. It is further suggested to recall batches of plasma\u2010derived medicinal products where a donor to a plasma pool subsequently develops vCJD. But regarding these measures, it has to be considered that the thinkable risk of a vCJD transmission is not exchanged for the real risk caused by a shortage of life\u2010saving blood and blood products. To guarantee the long\u2010term stability of blood supply, suitable promotion and motivation campaigns for recruiting blood donors should be carried out. In addition, Germany started an initiative for \u2018optimum use\u2019 of blood products in 1999 [54], which is now generally recommended. This means to avoid the use of blood and blood products wherever possible and represents the best way to reduce a potential risk on transmission. Finally, the substitution of plasma\u2010derived medicinal products with alternative products such as recombinant proteins as well as the development of substitutes for albumin is encouraged.",

Under them, the synthetic thrombin inhibitor, melagatran and its orally available prodrug, ximelagatran have completed the mutual recognition procedure in Europe in May 2004, and has been introduced in Germany in June of the same year. Although the intensive research on new antithrombotic drugs during the last decades was certainly driven mainly by the clinical need of more effective and safer drugs, the current trends in drug development also consider the precaution\u2010guided suggestion by the health authorities to replace animal\u2010derived products. If the health care systems are willing to pay the costs combined with such innovative therapies, we could become independent of the use of animal products for antithrombotic therapy.",

            "text": "During the last decade, the precautionary principle has gained in importance. It is an approach to manage uncertain risks and to prevent any damage to the environment or human health. A key element is to take action, even if some cause and effect relationships are not fully established scientifically. In the meantime, it is increasingly implemented in medicine. An important subject is potential threats by medicinal products of human or animal origin. Manifold official precaution\u2010guided regulations have been stated to improve their safety and particularly to avoid any infection by viruses and TSE pathogens by animal and human\u2010derived medicinal products. The best preventive measure is to substitute them with alternative products whenever possible. In contrast to the opinion of sceptics, this promotes research and science. The new antithrombotic drug, fondaparinux, exemplary demonstrates that it is principally possible to become independent on animal\u2010derived products in the future. But it has to be considered that ultimately the official precaution\u2010oriented requirements can only be met, if the healthcare systems and the public are willing to pay the costs for corresponding innovative medicinal products.",
