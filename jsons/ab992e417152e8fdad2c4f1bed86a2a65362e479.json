These works all indicated that no signal of interstitial-probe complexes were detected while several signals of vacancy-probe complexes were observed. From these experimental results, it appears that the majority of point defects produced in deformed metals are vacancies. Especially for the stage IT recovery in cold-worked aluminium, Sassa e t al. [6] analyzed the defect line of the Mossbauer spectrum and concluded that the defects annealed a t a temperature as low as 100 I ( were vacancies. I n our previous paper [ 7 ] , we have proposed that defects recovered a t stage T I were of vacancy type on the basis of the following reason: the suppressive effect of impurities on stage IT recovery was ordered as Ge > Si > Cu > Ag > Mg, consistent with the order of magnitude of the interaction between vacancies and impurities, in reactions leading to the formation of dislocation loops in quenched dilute aluminiiiin alloys [8] .",

The activation energy of the recovery around 100 K was estimated t o be 0.2 to 0.3 eV by Sassa et al., according to the analysis of the temperature dependence of the defect line intensity [6] . Frois [9] obtained activation energies of 0.22 and 0.32 eV for the recovery peaks at about 80 and 125 K, respectively. As pointed out by this author, however, it seems that the activation energy increases gradually with increasing temperature and annealing should not be assigned to simple processes. For the separation of processes, the activation energy has to be measured with a temperature interval as small as possible, as described in the next section. Also, only an apparent activation energy is obtained experimentally, when some recovery processes occur simultaneously. We have examined the activation energy change in the region of 50 to 85 K (transition period between stages I and 11) in deformed pure aluminium and its dilute alloys [lo] . It was reported that the recovery in this temperature range can be interpreted by an overlapping of two processes consisting of dislocation rearrangement (below 6 0 K ) and the annihilation of vacancies due t o diffusion along dislocations.",

But subpeaks in stage 11, appearing a t 75 and 90 K, which are newly found in our previous work [7] and investigated in detail by Ohtaki [13] , are not observed.

But three parameters (see Table 1 ) obtained here for species n = 1 to 3 give an impression that not only single vacancies but also small vacancy clusters such as di-and trivacancies contribute to stage IIA recovery. Collins [3] performed a PAC study of heavily deformed Au a t 77 K and resolved the recovery stage 111 into three different processes due to tri-, di-, and single vacancies. He found that in stage I11 of deformed Au trivacancies recovered a t the lowest temperature, then divacancies and finally single vacancies were annealed out in stage 111. So he concluded that tri-and divacancies were created during deformation without a reaction of single vacancies. Muller [4] also pointed out that lorig-range migration of divacancies occurred around 200 K in A1 elongated by 5 to 20% a t 77 K. Moreover, it is well known that the activation energy of stage I11",

So the species in group 1, which mainly recover at about 85 K, will be assigned to vacancies and their small clusters.

As is mentioned in our previous paper 171, the recovery in this temperature region is strongly affected by impurities. Though the differential isochronal recovery curve of 5N A1 is almost flat throughout the stage 11, except for a small peak at about 140 K, the addition of each impurity up t o an amount of about 60 ppm produces small peaks a t subsequent temperatures. So the recovery in this substage is thought to be related to vacancy-impurity complexes. As shown in Table 1 , they have activation energies of 0.3 t o 0.42 eV, which are smaller than the migration energies of 0.47 to 0.65 eV for vacancy-type defects in the lattice [14] . So the recovery may occur by enhanced diffusion along dislocations, in the same way as in stage 11,. The difference between the activation energy of stage 11, (group.1) and that of stage 11, (group 2) can be explained by binding energies between vacancles and impurities. The binding energy between single vacancies and impurities in the lattice is smaller than 0.1 eV [15] , while that for small clusters is not known. When the vacancies are trapped at impurities, a summation of migration energy and binding energy between them is required for detrapping and annihilation of the vacancies.",

Another possibility of distributing the activation energy is the emission of vacancies from the small clusters and their annihilation a t sinks. The formation of small vacancy clusters during deformation are likely as mentioned before. In the lattice, binding energies of vacancies with their small clusters are estimated to be 0.22 to 0.25 eV [9] , and the activation energy for the annihilation of single vacancies detrapping from small clusters containing 4 to 10 vacancies is estimated to be 0.44 to 0.47 eV. Thus, if we assume pipe diffusion of vacancies detrapped from vacancyimpurity complexes and from small vacancy clusters, activation energies for stage 11, recovery may be distributed between 0.26 and 0.47 eV. Here we use binding energies of vacancy-impurity complexes and of vacancy clusters in the lattice, but they may have almost the same values as those in the dislocation pipe.
