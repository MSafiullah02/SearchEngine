Same day reporting on urines negative for bacteria and WBC could impact inappropriate antimicrobial use. As well, same day reporting on the presence of bacteria/WBC may influence decisions regarding empiric antimicrobial therapy. We evaluated the UF1000 flow cytometry on urines submitted for culture and susceptibility testing. Methods: Urines submitted to Clinical Microbiology Royal University Hospital, Saskatoon, SK, Canada were used. Raw and boric acid preserved urines were included in the evaluation from inpatients and outpatients. Approximately 1 ml of urine was placed in a separate tube for flow cytometry performed twice on each specimen. All urines were inoculated to tryptic soy agar containing 5% sheep red blood cells and MacConkey agar and incubated in O 2 for 18-24 hours. Culture results were correlated with bacterial/ WBC counts from flow cytometry readings. Results: A total of 827 urines were analyzed (393 preserved, 434 raw). For raw urines, 142 (32.7%) had \u226410 bacterial cells/ul, 4 (0.9%) had \u226525 WBC/ul by FC; 239 (55.1%) had \u226450 bacterial cells/ul, 18 (4%) had \u226525 WBC/ul. Of the 239 urines with \u226450 bacteria/\u00b5l, 200 (83.7%) were 'no growth' or 'mixed' by culture, 0 (100%) urines had >100 million bacteria/L. Similar results were seen for preserved urines: 139 (35.4%) had \u226410 bacteria/\u00b5l, 7 (1%) had \u226525 WBC/\u00b5l, 195 (49.6%) had \u226450 bacteria/\u00b5l, 17 (4.3%) had \u226525 WBC/\u00b5l. Of the 195 preserved urines with \u226450 bacteria/\u00b5l, 167 (85.6%) were 'no growth' or 'mixed' by culture, 0 (100%) urine had >100 million bacteria/L. Conclusion: Screening of urine using flow cytometry has the potential to identify up to 50% of urines that do not require culture and can be same day reported as negative. A cut off of \u226450 bacteria/\u00b5l correlated with insignificant colony counts from urine culture; a higher cut off would further reduce the number of urines for culture. Our laboratory processes approximately 80,000 urines per year and with the possibility of 50% same day reported as negative influences workload, work flow and likely positively impacts antimicrobial stewardship programs.

MALDI-TOF MS is very practical for clinical identification but for some problematic species, selected gene sequencing is necessary in order to make the identification more reliable. Few studies have investigated the performance of MALDI-TOF MS system in VGS identification. Methods: Using 16S rRNA gene or gyrB gene sequencing as a gold standard, the performance of two MALDI-TOF MS instruments in the identification of 181 VGS clinical isolates was studied. Results: The Bruker Biotyper and Vitek MS IVD systems correctly identified 88.4% and 98.9% of the 181 isolates, respectively. The Vitek MS RUO system was the least reliable, only correctly identifying 38.7% of the isolates to species level with several misidentifications and invalid results. The Bruker Biotyper system was very unreliable in the identification of species within the mitis group. Among 22 non-pneumococci isolates (S. mitis/S. oralis/S. pseudopneumoniae), Biotyper misidentified 21 of them as S. pneumoniae leading to a low sensitivity and low positive predictive value in these species. In contrast, the Vitek MS IVD demonstrated a better resolution for pneumococci and nonpneumococci despite the inability to distinguish between S. mitis/S. oralis. Conclusion: For more accurate species-level identification, further improvements in the VGS spectra databases are needed. Based on MALDI-TOF analysis and selected 16S rRNA gene plus gyrB genes sequencing, we designed a practical VGS identification algorithm.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Background: Enterococcus species are Gram-positive, facultatively anaerobic oval cocci and are part of the natural microbiota of the gastrointestinal tract in humans. They have emerged as leading causes of healthcare-associated infections and also cause a wide range in community-associated infections. Among the enterococcal infections, E. faecalis and E. faecium are the most encountered species, accounting up to 90% of the clinical isolates; the remaining are caused by other species such as E. avium, E. casseliflavus, E. gallinarum, E. hirae and E. raffinosus. Methods: A multiplex PCR assay was developed to differentate 7 frequently encounterd Enterococcus species. Thirteen strains including 1 E. avium, obtained from American Type Culture Collection were used as reference strains. Clinical isolates of enterococci were collected from National Taiwan University Hospital and Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital. Results: The multiplex PCR assay with one forward primer and seven species-specific reverse primers were designed based on the determined groEL sequences. The expected sizes of the amplicons were 601 bp for E. avium, 770 bp for E. casseliflavus, 135 bp for E. faecalis, 369 bp for E. faecium, 220 bp for E. gallinarum, 285 bp for E. hirae and 421 bp for E. raffinosus. Reference strains and clinical isolates were tested, and all yielded the expected amplicon sizes. Specificcity of the multiplex PCR was tested with other Enterococcus species including E. cecorum, E. durans and E. mundtii. None of these bacterial species generated products of similar size to those for the seven Enterococcus species.

Global epidemiology also shows that specific strains or genotypes of the same serotype of dengue viruses (DENVs) did increase in epidemic severity. Therefore, this study aimed at better defining the 'epidemic potential' of DENV through epidemiological, virological, and immunological characterization that will be worthwhile pursuing for future prediction of epidemic severity. We isolated the DENV-2 strains from patients presented as clinically mild dengue fever (DF) versus severe dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) cases with different epidemiological conditions (e.g. temporal and spatial attributes) during the same epidemic in the same city for better monitoring dynamics of viral genetic and phenotypic changes through an epidemic process. Additionally, different clades of DENV-2 with viral sequence variations isolated at various time points were used for spatial analyses on viral spreading and reproductive numbers of R0. DHF cases appeared mostly during climbing up and peaking time of dengue cases through temporal and spatial evolution of the epidemic in southern Taiwan. Interestingly, DENV-2 variations occurred at different days after the onset of dengue illness of the same patient at micro-level as well as in different time periods of the same epidemic at macro-level of population dynamics. Moreover, different DENV-2 isolates with viral sequence variations did have differences in viral growth kinetics, viral transmissibility and spatial spreading. The epidemiological conditions are more important than immune status of primary or secondary DENV infection as driving forces associated with viral changes and severe dengue cases, particularly in areas with low incidence of dengue in previous years. Taiwan has not been an area of dengue-endemicity, providing a very valuable opportunity to integrate clinical, epidemiological, viral and immunological findings from those time-dependent DENV isolates to generate causal inference to fully understanding the mechanism of increasing epidemic severity.

In vitro antifungal susceptibility testing (AFST) should provide informative hints clinical drug use and predict the outcomes of treatment to a certain extent. The purpose of this study was to determine the antifungal susceptibility profiles of 384 clinical Aspergillus isolates from two centers in Taiwan and mainland China to the active antifungal drugs usually used and contribute to the knowledge of prevailing antifungal resistance patterns of Aspergillus at the two different centers. Methods: We have performed in vitro AFST of 384 genetically confirmed Aspergillus isolates representing of 23 different species collected from various clinical sources against the active antifungal drugs of amphotericin B, triazole and echinocandins using Sensititre YeastOne, a commercially available alternative to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute microdilution method for Aspergillus, and analyzed the susceptibility profiles according to a general minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs)/minimum effective concentrations (MECs) interpretation code. Difference in antifungal resistance patterns between the two centers Aspergillus isolates was also compared. Results: In total, 77.6% (298/384) of the tested Aspergillus isolates showed entirely susceptible profiles to all tested antifungals with fairly low MICs and MECs of \u22641 \u00b5g/mL, and 22.4% (86/384) isolates from different Aspergillus species showed resistance to one or two classes of antifungal drugs. Amphotericin B resistance was the predominant problem in those isolates showed reduced susceptibility, with a rate of 91.9% (79/86). Two A. fumigatus isolates resistant to triazole were discovered; one was resistant to voriconazole with a MIC >8 \u00b5g/mL and the other to itraconazole with a MIC of 16 \u00b5g/mL. No triazole cross-resistant isolates were found. Echinocandins were highly potent to the Aspergillus isolates tested. No distinct difference in the resistant profiles was observed between the two center isolates except for A. flavus from mailand China showed a higher resistance rate to amphotericin B of 53.8% (35/65) than those from Taiwan (25% (7/28)). Conclusion: We have identified the antifungal susceptibility profiles of clinical Aspergillus isolates from two centers in Taiwan and mainland China. Several resistance patterns were discovered among the different Aspergillus species. The potent in vitro activity of triazoles and echinocandins in this study indicates that these two classes of antifungal agents have a clinically important role in treatment of Aspergillus infections.

Conclusion: Early diagnostic and therapeutic vitrectomy is useful for obtaining sufficient samples for organism identification and also to reduce organism load and inflammatory mediators in the eye. Timely reporting the results of direct smear to clinical physician is very meaningful for the initial selection of antimicrobial agents.

Results: Physical examinations were normal except for disorientation and loss of vigor. Laboratory data exept for a low CD4 level at 44/\u00b5L and slight elevation of CRP were normal. Cryptococcal antigen was elevated while toxoplasma IgG and IgM were negative. Plain head CT scan and gadolinium-enhanced head MRI revealed brain edema and three masses in frontal and occipital lobes, which might have been induced by Cryptococcus spp. or other bacteria, or immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). Lymphoma was not strongly suspected because multiple lesions should decrease its likelihood and gadolinium-enhanced MRI had not shown any lesion 3 months prior.

Further NMR studies confirmed the binding mode in solution. Titration of peptide substrates with different lengths reveals that the N-terminal cap is also required for the binding because peptides without the aldehyde group do not bind to the protease.

Parenteral transmission is common route. In hemodialysis units, nearly all of the patients screens for both of them. AntiHCV and HbsAg are oftenly used. Despite some prevention methods such as device separation; cross infections occurs. Occult infections of hepatitis B and C virus can not be diagnosed by standard laboratory screening tests. Detection of the HBV DNA in the absence of HBsAg antigen in the serum is called occult hepatitis B infection (OBI).

This ex vivo study presents urinary concentrations (UC) and bactericidal activity of tobramycin in a subset. Methods: Urine of 9 healthy subjects was collected before and 0-2, 2-4, 4-8, 4-12, 12-16, 16-24 hours (h) after oral administration of 600 mg Tobrate\u2122 (tobramycin formulated for improved absorption). The UC were determined by a LC-MS/MS method. Urinary bactericidal titers (UBTs) were determined for five test strains. The minimal inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations (MIC/MBC) of the test strains were determined in cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton Broth (CAMHB) and in pooled blank urine (MBC) of the subjects at different pH (5.5; 6.5; 7.5; 8.5). Results: The median UC of tobramycin were 0.3; 33.1; 25.7; 7.1; 3.3; and 1.3 mg/L. The individual urine pH ranged between 5.3 and 8.2. The MIC/MBC (mg/L) of tobramycin for the test strains: Escherichia coli ATCC 25922: 4/4 mg/L; E. coli 1949820: 2/2 mg/L; Klebsiella pneumoniae 595: 2/2 mg/L; Proteus mirabilis 414: 8/16 mg/L; Pseudomonas aeruginosa 586: 0.5/1 mg/L. In blank urine the MBC (mg/L) was 16 mg/L or more for all strains at pH 5.5, and at pH 6.5/ 7.5/8.5 for E. coli ATCC 25922: 2/1/1 mg/L; E. coli 1949820: 8/2/ 2 mg/L; K. pneumoniae 595: 4/2/2 mg/L; P. mirabilis 414: 8/4/ 8 mg/L; P. aeruginosa 586: 16/4/1 mg/L. The median UBT values during the collecting periods 2-4/4-8 h: E. coli ATCC 25922: 2/4; E. coli 1949820: 4/2; K. pneumoniae 595: 4/4; P. mirabilis 414: 4/2; P. aeruginosa 586: 2/1. For each strain at least a UBT of 2 was reached in all subjects, except an UBT of 1 in 2 subjects for the P. aeruginosa strain. Conclusion: The new Enteris formulation of oral tobramycin significantly improved the very poor absorption of standard tobramycin salt. After a single dose of 600 mg of oral tobramycin, positive UBTs could be reached against all strains, with highest titers observed during the collection period of 2-4 hours (in 1 subject of 4-8 hours) after administration. For all pathogens tested, concentrations of tobramycin in urine were at least two times above urinary MBC. On average urinary MBC was present up to 8 hours. Therefore a BID or TID dosage regimen may be suitable for testing treatment of urinary tract infection in clinical studies.

Although it is relatively sensitive against most antibiotics, clindamycin, tetracycline, and levofloxacin-resistant Streptococcus pyogenes has emerged recently. Although many researchers pay attention to antimicrobial susceptibility patterns such as Antibiogram, few researchers concern how antibiotics affect the toxin-production of drug-resistant Streptococcus pyogenes. Now we focus on the antibiotic induced toxin-production from multidrug-resistant Streptococcus pyogenes. Methods: Multidrug-resistant (clindamycin-, tetracycline-, and levofloxacin-resistant) Streptococcus pyogenes was isolated from Daido Hospital in Japan. This clinical isolate was confirmed by VITEK II system. The antibiotic-resistant patterns such as MICs were determined by E-test according to CLSI recommendation. Bacteria was pre-incubated on sheep blood agar for 24 hours and adjusted to 1 \u00d7 10 8 CFU. Then, it incubated Todd Hewitt broth with 10 \u03bcg/mL clindamycin, tetracycline, and levofloxacin, respectively. At adequate time points, we measured the turbidity (O.D. 600 nm) of bacterial culture for growth analysis. After 12 hours, we analyzed the DNase activity and hemolysis assays by using bacterial culture. Results: The MICs of clindamycin, tetracycline, and levofloxacin on bacteria were >256 \u03bcg/mL, >256 \u03bcg/mL, and >16 \u03bcg/mL, respectively. There were no differences of growth between antibiotic treated and untreated bacteria. The DNase and hemolysis activities from levofloxacin-induced bacteria were significant greater than those from antibiotic-untreated bacteria. The DNase and hemolysis activities from clindamycin-induced bacteria were slightly greater than those from antibiotic-untreated bacterium. Tetracycline did not affect the DNase and hemolysis activities on this bacteria significantly. Conclusion: This study showed that there is a difference in toxin production even for the same antibiotic-resistant bacteria depending on the type of antibacterial agent. Our result also revealed that levofloxacin-induced the toxin production on drug-resistant Streptococcus pyogenes. Background: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative bacterium commonly implicated in nosocomial infections; it is also associated with resistance to multiple first-line antimicrobial agents. Ceftolozane/tazobactam is a new antimicrobial combination approved by the FDA for the treatment of infections due to P. aeruginosa. We detected ceftolozane/tazobactam resistance in a clinical isolate and examined the possible underlying mechanism(s). Methods: Bloodstream isolates of P. aeruginosa from 2015 and 2016 were screened for multidrug resistance. Selected isolates were subjected to susceptibility testing of a secondary antimicrobial agent panel by Etests and clonal uniqueness was confirmed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Hydrolytic activity of crude cell lysate was assessed using a spectrophotometric assay with nitrocefin as the substrate, after normalizing for total protein content. P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and a clinical isolate known to harbor VIM-2 were used as controls. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) analysis from whole genome sequencing was undertaken to provide additional insights on resistance mechanism(s). Reads from selected isolates were mapped against the genome of the reference strain PAO1. Variants identified by GATK, SamTools and CLC Genomics Workbench 8.5 were selected and annotated with SnpEff. Results: Out of 81 bloodstream isolates screened, 5 were resistant to ceftolozane/tazobactam ( prevalence = 6.2%). Specifically, we identified a pair of isolates from the same patient. The index isolate was susceptible to ceftolozane/tazobactam (MIC = 1.5/4 mg/L), but another isolate recovered 24 days later (mutant) was resistant (MIC = 6/4 mg/L). Similar susceptibility profiles were also seen with ceftazidime/avibactam. Both isolates were clonally similar by PFGE. Normalized hydrolytic activity was found to be approximately 25% higher in the mutant isolate. Whole genome sequencing revealed mutations in genes predicted to encode a D-Ala-D-Ala carboxypeptidase DacB (G87D), AmpD (V10G), and AmpC \u03b2lactamase (V213A) in the resistant isolate. Conclusion: Ceftolozane/tazobactam resistance in P. aeruginosa could be mediated via overexpression of beta-lactamase (e.g., AmpC). Background: Antibiotic resistance has become a global health threat due to the rapid evolution of multi-drug resistance in pathogenic bacteria as well as the shortage of avaibile alternatives for treating bacterial infections, especially for Gram-negative bacteria. Robenidine (NCL812), a currently registered animal coccidiostat, has been shown to have bactericidal activity against Gram-positive organisms including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. During analogue screening undertaken for NCL001 to NCL266, NCL259 and NCL265 showed the best activity in initial screening test agsint two MRSA and two E. coli isolates (MIC ranging 8-16 \u00b5g/mL). Meanwhile, these two compounds also demonstrated excellent bactericidal activity according to minimum bactericidal concentration testing against Gramnegative bacteria, achieving 100% reduction of colony forming units within 20 minutes at the MIC for a selected E. coli strain. Methods: Minimum inhibitory concentrations, Minimum bactericidal concentration and time-kill kinetic assays were used to evaluate efficacy and pharmacodynamics against 91 human pathogenic isolates (E. coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae) and 134 animal pathogenic isolates (ExPEC, ETEC). In vitro toxicity profiles were created using cell cytotoxicity assays against a variety of eukaryotic cell lines. Synergistic or antagonistic effects of an efflux pump inhibitor in conjunction with the compounds were examined using the checkerboard method. Results: The compounds demonstrated antimicrobial activity against a range of human and veterinary pathogens at low concentrations (NCL259, MIC 50 < 64 \u00b5g/mL; NCL265, MIC 50 < 16 \u00b5g/ mL). This activity was bacteriostatic and was sustained overa 24 hour period. The compounds have a much lower MIC in E. coli lacking the drug efflux pump (AcrB) and the MICs against the wild type E. coli were significantly lower in the presence of an efflux pump inhibitor. SDS-PAGE also showed the resistant and sensitive Klebsiella isolates differed in cell membrane protein composition. Conclusion: NCL259 and NCL265 have powerful bactericidal activity against Gram-negative bacteria and they are efflux pump substrates. Therefore, the usage of efflux pump inhibitors in combination with NCL 259/265 may increase activity against Gramnegative bacteria. These results suggest that these compounds and further derivatives have the potential to be developed into novel antimicrobial therapies against human/veterinary Gram-negative pathogens.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Methods:"}, {"text": "OS 4-6 High in vitro activity of meropenem/RPX7009 against KPC-producing Enterobacteriaceae in China Qiwen Yang, Ge Zhang, Zhipeng Xu, Yingchun Xu.

The expression level of the ompK35, ompK36 and acrB genes of selected clinical isolates were compared with that of K.pneumoniae strain ATCC13883. While the expression level of blaKPC-2 gene of the clinical isolates were compared with that of K. pneumoniae strain BAA1705.

Both MIC 50 and MIC 90 of meropenem alone were >64 \u00b5g/mL. Addition of RPX7009 resulted in a dose-depended reduction of meropenem MIC: MIC 50 decreased to 8 \u00b5g/mL and 0.5 \u00b5g/mL in the presence of 2 \u00b5g/mL and 8 \u00b5g/mL of RPX7009, respectively. Maximal reduction of MIC 50 (to 0.25 \u00b5g/mL) was observed at 16 \u00b5g/mL of RPX7009. MIC 90 decreased to 8 \u00b5g/mL and 1 \u00b5g/mL in the presence of 8 \u00b5g/mL or 16 \u00b5g/mL of RPX7009, respectively. Maximal reduction of MIC 90 (to 0.5 \u00b5g/mL) was observed at 32 \u00b5g/ mL of RPX7009. Thirteen K. pneumoniae isolates which belonged to 4 clones were selected to investigate the relationship between the resistance level of meropenem plus RPX7009(MEM + RPX) and the gene expression level of blaKPC-2, ompK35, ompK36 and acrB genes. In the 8 strains with Meropenem + RPX7009 (8ug/ml) MIC of >1 ug/mL, decreased expression was found in ompK35 gene (8/8) and ompK36 (3/8) compared to the strain ATCC13883. increased expression was found in blaKPC-2 (6/8) and acrB (5/8). We have not noticed the obvious correlation between MEM + RPX high MIC and any single gene expression. However, isolates with high MEM + RPX MIC tend to express more KPC-2 and/or have ompK35/ompK36 loss. Conclusion: Addition of RPX7009 resulted in a dose-depended reduction of meropenem MIC against KPC-producing carbapenemresistant Enterobacteriaceae.

Background: Colistin is considered as the last resort to treat carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae infections, and its increase in resistance is a global concern. Plasmid mediated colistin resistance gene, mcr-1, has been found in distinct bacterial species from human, animals and environment. Furthermore, mcr-1 has been reported in several animal-origin isolates. Methods: Samples were collected from swine farms, cattle farms and broiler farms in four provinces (Jilin, Shandong, Henan and Guangzhou) of China in September 2016. All isolates were investigated by antimicrobial susceptibility testing and polymerase chain reaction for resistance genes screening (bla NDM , bla KPC , bla IMP and mcr-1). S1-PFGE and Southern blotting hybridization were used to determine the plasmid location of resistance genes. We also performed conjugation assays to test transferability of mcr-1 or bla NDM -bearing plasmids and further assessed biological costs of plasmid carriage by growth curve assay. coli also demonstrated resistant to polymyxin B, in which mcr-1 and bla NDM were coexistence. Most of these resistant genes located on plasmids, with sizes ranging from 40 to 244kb. 76.9% of mcr-1 located on IncI2 plasmid of roughly 65kb. The mainly type of carbapenemase was bla NDM-9 (13/26), which located on a non-typeable plasmid of approximately104kb.

In our hospital, in MSSA cases with sensitivity to ampicillin, we usually select ampicillin after confirming a negative result of a \u03b2-lactamase test. We report two cases in which ampicillin was successfully used to treat severe MSSA infections. Case 1: The patient was an 85-year-old woman whose chief complaints were fever and right buttock pain.

National Taiwan University Hospital and National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan Background: Mycobacterium abscessus is an intrinsically multidrug-resistant pathogen which has emerged as a global threat among lipotourists, chronic lung disease and auto-interferon gamma antibody producing patients.

Exploring synergy between active available drugs is rational given the lack of new active drugs.

Background: Hypervirulent (HV) K. pneumoniae strains are associated with invasive syndromes such as liver abscess. We assessed the effect of capsular serotypes on the induction of HV and mucoid phenotypes and the effect of these phenotypes on the production of capsular (lipo)polysaccharides. Methods: A retrospective study of K. pneumoniae bacteremia cases was conducted in a 900-bed tertiary-care university hospital in Japan. String test was performed on all isolates to find HV strains. Mucoid phenotype was determined by visual inspection of colonies. Expression of capsular serotypes K1/K2 and magA/rmpA genes were determined by PCR. Clinical manifestations were collected from medical records. Results: A total of 134 patients with K. pneumoniae bacteremia was identified during the study period. 8% of isolates were determined as HV strains, and serotype K1 was predominant in these strains ( p = 0.004). In serotype K1-positive strains, both HV and mucoid phenotypes were observed more often than K1-negative strains (p \u2264 0.0001). However, by logistic regression analysis, mucoid phenotype was independently associated with serotype K1 (odds ratio, 7.73; 95% confidence interval, 1.44-40.81) . MagA and rmpA gene expression was strongly associated with serotype K1 ( p < 0.0001). Both HV and mucoid phenotypes were associated with overproduction of capsular polysaccharides (Figure 1 ). Liver abscess formation was strongly associated with the mucoid phenotype (odds ratio, 41.15; 95% confidence interval, 5.85-835.41) but not with the HV phenotype. Serotype K2 was not associated with either bacterial phenotype or liver abscess formation. Conclusion: Serotype K1 was a significant virulence factor for invasive syndromes through the induction of the mucoid phenotype and overproduction of capsular polysaccharides in K. pneumoniae bloodstream infection. Background: Natural history studies of HIV infection in pregnancy show that, prior to antiretroviral therapy, 25% of infants born to HIV-infected mothers become infected with HIV of which 5% are in-utero infections. The macrophage -tropic viral strain of HIV-1 (R5 virus) is the most commonly vertically transmitted strain. There is evidence of strong HIV-1 specific T-cell responses in the cord and peripheral blood of exposed-uninfected neonates. However, the exact mechanism of prevention of mother-to-foetus transmission (MFT) and, in particular, the role of macrophages remains unknown. The aim of the study was to determine whether placental macrophage are affected by highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) administered to HIV positive women during pregnancy. Methods: Placentas from seven HIV-infected women receiving HAARTand 3 non-infected women were obtained within two hours of delivery, fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin. 5 \u03bcm representative tissue sections were cut from representative areas of the placenta including the maternal surface and chorionic plate. To characterize the placental cells of macrophage phenotype, tissue sections were stained with the CD68 pan-macrophage antibody marker (CD68+ cells), Figure 1 . A section of intestine from a patient with Crohn's disease was included as a positive control. This sample exhibited a large number of CD68 strongly positive cells. Coded placental slides were evaluated by a histolopathologist experienced in placental pathology (PB) without knowledge of the patient's HIV status or transmission outcome. Results: Compared to healthy HIV-negative controls, foetal capillaries from test cases showed significantly reduced numbers of CD68+ cells (mean + SD; 14.6 + 8.4; 34.5 + 17.2, respectively, p = 0.03), Figure 2 . There was no difference in the numerical density of macrophage/monocytes within the villous stroma, trophoblast, and maternal vascular compartments between the two groups. Conclusion: The reduced frequency of macrophage in foetal capillaries of HAART -exposed placentas suggests regional differences in local placental immune selection. Such foetal \"immune escape\" may provide a protective mechanism against in-utero HIV transmission.

Ultra-high diluted Homeopathic medicines selected on the basis of symptom similarity acts favorably in very many infectious conditions under clinical settings. This pilot study attempts to study the action of commonly prescribed homeopathic medicines directly on the cultured MRSA isolate and concurrently testing the efficiency of same medicines in the diseased individual. Methods: 48 MRSA positive isolates from different clinical samples were isolated from using blood culture method. Few homeopathic medicines which were commonly prescribed for various infections were selected and sensitivity discs with those medicines were prepared as follows, 0.1cc of GMP standard homoeopathic dilutions were applied on 5 mm diameter sterile whatman filter paper and allowed to dry up completely. Samples from infections were cultured and bacterial strains were identified individually. Under sterile conditions Homeopathic sensitivity discs were fixed on bacterial culture plates and visible zones of inhibitions measured around each disc after incubation for 24 hrs. Results: Culture result showed Gram positive MRSA isolates. Homeopathic remedies showed zone of inhibition around the sensitivity discs. There were multiple sensitive drugs for same isolate.

Background: Toxigenic strains of Clostridium difficile cause disease through production of the large clostridial toxins A and/or B. Nontoxigenic C. difficile [NTCD] strains do not produce either of these toxins and thus are considered clinically irrelevant. However, some strains of C. difficile, including NTCD, produce an ADP-ribosylating toxin [CDT] , the significance of which is unknown. These strains have recently been isolated from patients with severe diarrhoea, suggesting possible symptomatic infection due to CDT-NTCD. However, there are limited studies investigating the function(s) of CDT and its role in C. difficile infection. We sought to investigate the differences in virulence traits in toxigenic and CDT-NTCD C. difficile strains known to be prevalent in both animals and humans. Methods: Molecular typing experiments using three methods (PCR ribotyping/PCR-RT, multi-locus sequence typing/MLST and pulsedfield gel electrophoresis/PFGE) were performed on a diverse collection of 149 CDT-NTCD strains [humans n = 29, bovine n = 54, porcine n = 39, food n = 1, environment n = 26] to identify the best approach for typing these strains. Other phenotypic experiments performed included germination and sporulation assays, motility tests, cell cytotoxicity assays and assessment of pathogenicity in a murine model of infection. A subset of the CDT-NTCD strains underwent whole genome sequencing to identify genetic elements associated with survival and pathogenicity. Results: The diversity of the CDT-NTCD strains was best illustrated by PFGE, revealing three discrete pulso-types within one ribotype, however this method was labor intensive and irreproducible. All our isolates belonged to MLST Clade 5, a characteristic they share with the \"hypervirulent\" C. difficile lineage UK078. Motility studies showed that 94% of the CDT-NTCD strains were phenotypically non-motile [UK033, UK288, UK238] and had deletions in F2 [glycosylation genes] and F3 [early-stage flagellar genes] regions of their flagellar operons. Seven ribotypes [UK585, UK586, QX143, QX260, QX360, QX444 and QX521] were slightly motile but significantly less so than the reference strain R20291 and lacked the three glycosyltransferase genes [CD0241, CD0242 and CD0243] essential for C. difficile flagellum assembly and full motility. The flagellin and flagella cap genes, fliC and fliD, involved in adherence and host colonisation were conserved in all strains including reference strains. Genetic variations in cell surface proteins, Cwp2, Cwp66, Cwp84, SecA2 and SlpA, were also noted across different ribotypes. We confirmed toxicity of the CDT-NTCD C. difficile strains in Vero cells, however, this was not demonstrated in a mouse model of disease. Mice infected with CDT-NTCD strains all survived the infection despite detection of high numbers of spores [10 7 CFU/g] in the faeces at either 24hr or 96hr post-infection. They showed no signs of diarrhoea with the exception of mice infected with QX146 that had soft faeces/diarrhoea at 24 hours postinfection and weight loss.

Background: Zoonotic Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis (S. choleraesuis), causing paratyphoid in pigs as well as bacteremia and mycotic aneurysm in humans, may carry a virulence plasmid ( pSCV50) and sometimes an antimicrobial-resistant plasmid. The aim of this study is to decipher the likely mechanism of how a virulence-resistance chimera of plasmid pOU7519 forms in S. choleraesuis. Methods: Whole plasmid sequence of pOU7519 in S. Choleraesuis strain OU7519 was determined using shotgun cloning and sequencing. Sequence annotation and comparison were performed to determine the sequence responsible for the formation of a chimeric virulence-resistance pOU7519. Other chimeric plasmids in the clinical S. Choleraesuis isolates were also examined. Results: The sequence of pOU719, 127,212-bp long, was identified to be a chimera of virulence pSCV50 and multidrug-resistant pSC138, that are found in S. Choleraesuis strain SC-B67. The pOU7519 contains various mobile DNAs, including prophages, insertion sequences, integron and transposons, especially the complex Tn21-like transposon Tn6088. By dissecting the junction site of the pSCV50-pSC138 chimera in pOU7519, defective sequences at integrase gene scv50 (int) and its attachment site (att) were found, and that likely resulted in a stable chimera plasmid due to the failure of excision from the pSCV50-pSC138 chimera.

Previous studies have elucidated that macrolides inhibit MUC5AC overexpression as its immunomodulatory effect. The purpose of this study is to reveal the anti-inflammatory effect of SOL by inhibition of bacteria-induced MUC5AC overproduction. Methods: We used Streptococcus pneumoniae (Sp) lysate and Haemophilus influenzae (Hi) lysate to induce MUC5AC hypersecretion. H292 and A549 cells were cultured in liquid medium and grown in an incubator. After overnight serum starvation, cells were stimulated with various concentrations of lysate for 24 hours. In inhibition study, the cells were treated with SOL simultaneously with stimulation. In each study, the MUC5AC protein levels were measured by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: H292 and A549 cells were stimulated by 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 \u03bcg/mL of Sp and Hi lysate, respectively. In H292 cells, Sp lysate induced MUC5AC production most significantly at 15 \u03bcg/mL (220.0 \u00b1 54.1%; P < 0.001), and Hi at 15 \u03bcg/mL (170.8 \u00b1 47.3%; P < 0.001). In A549 cells, Sp at 15 \u03bcg/mL (98.1 \u00b1 35.7%; P < 0.001), and Hi at 15 \u03bcg/mL (184.6 \u00b1 25.2%; P < 0.001). In inhibition studies (Figure 1) , SOL inhibited MUC5AC production in H292 cells induced by Sp and Hi most significantly at concentrations of 50 \u03bcg/mL (47.0 \u00b1 13.9% versus 3.0 \u00b1 13.5% [P < 0.01] and 32.8 \u00b1 28.6% versus \u221210.9 \u00b1 20.7% [P < 0.05], respectively). Similarly, SOL inhibited MUC5AC production in A549 cells induced by Sp and Hi most significantly at concentrations of 100 \u03bcg/mL (101.9 \u00b1 85.7% versus \u221224.6 \u00b1 22.4% [P < 0.01] and 115.2 \u00b1 40.3% versus \u221214.3 \u00b1 10.3% [P < 0.001], respectively).

This is the first study to reveal the immunomodulatory effect of SOL on human airway epithelial cells using bacterial stimulations. prophylaxis for colorectal surgery. However, there is little known about long-term effects of oral antibiotics on the bacterial flora in a surgical ward. Between Nov. 2007 and Dec. 2012 we have performed a randomized controlled trial to verify the efficacy of oral antibiotic prophylaxis in patients undergoing colorectal surgery (JMTO PREV 07-01). That trial concluded oral antibiotic prophylaxis reduced the risk of SSIs. Depending on the results, we have used oral antibiotic prophylaxis (kanamycin and metronidazole) to all patients undergoing colorectal surgery except patients with contraindication. In this study we investigated effects of oral antibiotic use for 10 years on the bacterial flora in our surgical ward. Methods: We retrospectively collected reports of all culturepositive specimen submitted from our surgical ward from Jan. 2012 to Dec. 2016. The frequencies and trends of bacteria were examined. Results: A total of 2281 organisms were identified. The top seven isolated organisms were E. coli (352/2281: 15.4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (220/2281: 9.6%), Enterococcus faecalis (219/2281: 9.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (193/2281: 8.4%), Enterobacter cloacae (167/2281: 7.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (118/2281: 5.1%), Enterococcus faecium (72/2281: 3.2%). Six species except E. faecium were consistent with the seven major species of bacteria reported in the national surveillance studies in Japan. These results seem that the oral antibiotic prophylaxis did not affect the bacterial flora isolated in our surgical ward. The annual trends in the proportion of isolated organisms were as follows: E. coli (2012: 14.1%, 2013: 16.6%, 2014: 16.2%, 2015: 14.9%, 2016: 15.5%), K. pneumoniae (7.3%, 9.1%, 9.9%, 16.0%, 10.4%), E. faecalis (11.4%, 7.5%, 7.7%, 13.2%, 8.3%), P. aeruginosa (7.3%, 6.0%, 13.1%, 10.8%, 7.8%), E. cloacae (6.9%, 4.8%, 10.2%, 6.3%, 13.0%), S. aureus (4.1%, 5.4%, 8.2%, 2.4%, 6.2%). These data did not show any significant changes of specific organisms over five years. Conclusion: Oral antibiotic prophylaxis use over years may not affect the bacterial flora in our surgical ward. Background: Cancer patients are often admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) due to vulnerable health condition and they are susceptible for colonization or infection. This study aims to address the long-term impact of having positive culture results during admission on one-year mortality among cancer patients who were admitted to ICU. Methods: We conducted this retrospective cohort study in Taichung Veterans General Hospital (VGHTC). Adult patients with a history of cancer who had at least one ICU admission during 2011 and 2016 in VGHTC after their cancer diagnosis were included. We included only the first ICU admission following cancer diagnosis (index ICU admission). Data regarding cancer diagnosis, location, and treatment were retrieved from cancer registry and data of demographic information, ICU admission, diagnoses, culture results, and medications were pulled from electronic medical records. The exposure is positive culture result during the index admission. The outcome is the mortality within one year after the index ICU admission. We assessed Kaplan-Meier survival curves and compared the mortality between patients with positive culture results and patients without positive culture results using log-rank test. We used a multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model to adjust for confounders and to evaluate the influence of positive culture results on one-year mortality. Results: We included 1,260 cancer patients who had at least one ICU admission following cancer diagnoses. Of them, 525 (41.7%) Figure: (abstract OS 9-1) had positive culture results during admission and 461 (36.6%) died within one year after ICU admission. Compared with patients who survived within one year after ICU admission, patients who died were significantly more likely to have positive culture results (33.0% vs 56.6%), to have a higher APACHEII score (median 21 vs 24), to receive mechanical ventilation (69.5% vs 83.1%), or to receive renal replacement (1.6% vs 7.2%). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that positive culture in blood, respiratory, or urine was associated with significantly increased one-year mortality (log-rank test p < 0.0001; Figure) , while positive culture in skin and soft tissue or abdomen had no impact. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression analysis showed that having positive culture in blood, respiratory, or urine (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.30; 95% confidence interval = 1.07-1.59) were significantly associated with 30% increased hazard of death within one year after the ICU admission, after adjusting for other factors.

Background: Campylobacter fetus is a part of the commensal flora found in the gastrointestinal tracts of cattle, and it rarely causes human infections. C. fetus-infected aneurysm (CFIA) is rare but fatal infection. The clinical epidemiology, risk factors, and optimal treatment of CFIA are still unclear. Methods: We present a 67-year-old man who was diagnosed with C. fetus bacteremia with infected left common iliac artery aneurysm and spondylodiscitis, successfully treated with antibiotics and surgery. We also reviewed the English and Japanese literature using PubMed, and ICHUSI (http://www.jamas.or.jp) by the Japanese Medical Abstract Society on CFIA. An episode of CFIA was defined as a patient having an aneurysm with at least 1 positive blood culture and/or positive arterial wall specimen culture yielding C. fetus. Results: We identified 46 cases in the English and Japanese literature from 1971 to 2016, and our case was also included. Apparently, CFIA was most frequently reported in France (36%), followed by Japan (28%). The median age of the patients was 70 years (range, 45-91 years), and 91% were men. The patients presented with fever (68%), abdominal pain (32%), and diarrhea (21%). Underlying diseases were cardiovascular disease (32%), hypertension (21%), alcoholism (13%), malignancy (11%), diabetes mellitus (4%), and exposure to raw meat (4%). Antimicrobial agents were initially administered as follows: penicillins in 7 (21%) of 33 (missing data for 14 cases), aminoglycosides in 7 (21%), carbapenems in 6 (18%), and fluoroquinolones in 6 (18%) cases. The median duration of the antimicrobial therapy was 42 days. The overall mortality rate was 19%; however, this rate increased to 47% (7/15) in cases of CFIA with rupture. Regardless of the type of initial antimicrobial agents used, all patients undergone surgery before their aneurysm ruptured had a favorable outcome. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the largest literature review of CFIA. Our results suggest that prompt surgical intervention is the most favorable outcome in CFIA. Furthermore, the frequent reporting of cases of this aneurysm in France and Japan might be due to the habitual consumption of raw meat.

Background: Environmental reservoir is an important source of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MRAB) outbreaks. The role of post-outbreak environmental surveillance for guiding sustained control effort has not been examined. Methods: Enhanced environmental disinfection and regular environmental surveillance of ward communal areas after an outbreak were performed in a University-affiliated hospital. To assess the usefulness of environmental culture in predicting patients with MRAB, weekly surveillance of communal areas was continued for 3 months after the outbreak in intervention wards. Results: Eight (57.1%) of 14 patients' immediate surroundings and 5 (31.3%) of 16 communal areas were contaminated with MRAB at the start of the outbreak. With enhanced environmental disinfection and isolation of MRAB patients, communal areas were rendered culture negative for MRAB. Post-outbreak weekly surveillance of communal areas showed that identification of newly diagnosed MRAB patients was significantly correlated with preceding environmental contamination with MRAB ( p = 0.001). The incidence of nosocomial MRAB infection was significantly lower in the intervention as compared with non-intervention wards (0.55 vs 2.28 per 1000 patient-days, p = 0.04). All MRAB isolated from the environmental and patients' samples belonged to MLST ST457 and were blaOXA23-like positive. Conclusion: Environmental surveillance may serve as a surrogate marker for the presence of MRAB carriers. Implementation of timely infection control measures should be guided by environmental culture for MRAB to minimize the risk of MRAB outbreak.

This revealed that there were 8, 6 and 8 different alleles of pbp2x, pbp1a and pbp2b, respectively and that one of three pbp2x alleles in serogroup6/ST13223 (x1), which was identical to that of 19F/ST320, was associated with the high MIC pattern to both PCG and CTX. Further analysis revealed recombination event was rarely observed in 19F/ST320 (r/m ratio 0.096), probably due to the disruption of competence pilus (comGC) gene by the insertion of a prophage, whereas frequent recombination was seen in serogroup6/ST13223 (r/m ratio 0.44) and recombination events spanning pbp2x were associated with the high MIC pattern. It also indicated ST13223 was probably derived from an ancestor through a recombination event acquiring a genome region spanning both ddl and pbp2b (the potential donor is PMEN1 Background: Hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae is a major cause of community-acquired pyogenic infections in Asian countries. Capsular type K1 K. pneumoniae strains were wellknown for their high virulence and associated invasive infections. They are usually susceptible to most antimicrobials, with the exception of ampicillin. Little is known regarding the clinical and molecular characteristics of antimicrobial-resistant K1 K. pneumoniae strains.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results:"}, {"text": "Methods: This retrospective study evaluated patients who were infected with capsular type K1 K. pneumoniae strains in a Taiwanese medical center between April 2013 and March 2016. Isolates from invasive diseases, such as bacteremia, pneumonia or pyogenic abscess, were included in this study. Antimicrobialresistant strains were defined as non-susceptibility to agents except ampicillin/amoxicillin. The clinical characteristics of these antimicrobial-resistant K1 K. pneumoniae infections were analyzed. These strains underwent analysis of pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), multilocus sequence typing (MLST), resistance mechanisms, and in vivo virulence. The in vivo virulence and resistance mechanisms of two isogenic strains with different resistance phenotypes were compared. Results: Among 190 capsular type K1 K. pneumoniae strains, 18 antimicrobial-resistant strains were identified. The 14-day and 28day mortality rates of infections caused by antimicrobial-resistant strains were significantly higher than that caused by antimicrobialsensitive strains (33% vs. 10.5%, p = 0.005; 50% vs 12.2%, p < 0.001; respectively). Most antimicrobial-resistant strains were associated with nosocomial (n = 11) or healthcare-associated infections (n = 5). They were not clonally related by PFGE, and the sequencing type (ST) of these strains were ST23 (n = 16), ST260 (n = 1), and ST340 (n = 1). Half these strains exhibited high in vivo virulence in a mouse lethality experiment (the 50% lethal dose \u2264 10 4 /cfu). The major resistance mechanisms involved the presence of \u03b2lactamases (SHV-5, SHV-12, CTX-M3, DHA-1) and the overexpression of efflux pumps (AcrAB/OqxAB). One strain exhibited higher resistance level of cephalosporins compared with its isogenic counterpart due to overexpression of DHA-1 cephalosporinase, but retained its high in vivo virulence. Conclusion: Antimicrobial-resistant capsular type K1 strains infections were associated with a high mortality rate. These virulent K1 K. pneumoniae strains can evolve to harbor various resistance mechanisms, which may represent an emerging and severe threat to public health. Infectious diseases and resistance to antibiotics are believed to be a major public health concern worldwide. Effective empirical therapy is a key factor. An understanding of local antibiotic resistance epidemiology is critical to be able to adapt empirical therapeutic strategies, and improve diagnosis and prevention. The aim of our study was to identify current trends in antibiotic resistance by analyzing local epidemiology in a large hospital center in Marseille, France, over a three-year period (January 2014 to December 2016). All data on antibiotic susceptibility were collected from public laboratory hospitals in Marseille, and we focused on the top 15 most common bacteria isolated. Over the period, Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing (AST) was performed for 99,932 bacterial species isolated. The top 15 most frequent bacteria represent 82.9% of all AST performed (n = 82,829). Overall, we found that the level of resistance to antibiotics was not worrying for the most common bacteria, with a significant decrease of resistance for key antibiotics including aminoglycosides, penicillins and cephalosporins for E. coli, P. mirabilis, S. marcescens and K. oxytoca. We observed an increase in resistance to cephalosporins and carbapenems for K. pneumoniae. For P. aeruginosa and M. morganii, we obtained a decrease of wild-type strains corresponding to full susceptibility to a panel composed of 9-12 antibiotics tested. Moreover, we observed a low level of resistance to carbapenem in Gram-negative bacteria with less than 3.2% in positive blood culture and <5% for other samples for the bacteria of the top 15. Thus, our study demonstrates that the level of resistance to antibiotics of the most common bacteria involved in infections is for beyond the recent alarmist publications and prediction of mortality due to MDR in the media. We believe that such epidemiological data are useful for implementing therapeutic strategies and for the continued real-time surveillance of the evolution of resistance to antibiotics in common bacteria.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results:"}, {"text": "these patients were decolonized after rifampin usage.

Background: The etiology of infections of the central nervous system (CNS) in Nepal often goes unrecognized due to underdeveloped laboratory facilities. This might lead to overtreatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics and possible side effects. In addition, the use of over the counter antibiotics before arrival to hospital is widespread in the area which complicates the diagnostic evaluation for the clinicians.

Patient data was registered and analysis of blood cells in CSF including differential count was performed at the hospital. The samples were initially stored at \u221220\u00b0C and transported on dry ice to \u00d6rebro, Sweden, where multiplexed PCR was performed targeting six bacteria, seven viruses and two fungi (FilmArray ME panel, BioFire, BioMerieux). Results: 89% of the patients had CSF white cell count >3/\u03bcL suggesting CNS infection. Of the bacteria analyzed with the assay, H. influenzae was found in 46 samples, S. pneumoniae in 44, and N. meningitidis in 1 sample. Of these, 31 samples were positive for both H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae. Neither L. monocytogenes, E. coli K1 nor S. agalactiae were found. Cryptococcus neoformans/ gatti was found in four samples. The viruses detected included enterovirus (n = 8), varicella zoster virus (n = 5), herpes simplex virus 1 (n = 3) and human herpes virus 6 (n = 3). 59% of the samples were negative. 67% of the patients had taken antibiotics before lumbar puncture, mainly oral cephalosporins. Conclusion: By using the FilmArray multiplex PCR panel we detected important pathogens known to cause CNS infections. A relatively large proportion of the samples were positive for both H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae which was unexpected. The prevalence of DNA from these bacteria could in most cases be confirmed by other methods, but all are not considered to be clinically relevant. A relatively large proportion of the samples were tested negative for the pathogens included in the PCR assay, which indicates that CNS infections in the area often are caused by other important pathogens such as other viruses or mycobacteria. Interestingly a majority of the patients had taken broad-spectrum antibiotics before arrival to hospital which highlights the urgent need for improved routine diagnostics. Background: Numerous studies have indicated that appropriate empiric antibiotic therapy is associated with survival in adult patients with bloodstream infection. However, the utility of empiric antibiotic therapy for pediatric patients with bloodstream infection has not yet been well studied. The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of an inappropriate empiric antibiotic therapy on mortality in pediatric patients with bloodstream infection. Methods: We retrospectively collected the data of pediatric patients (aged \u226415 years) with positive blood culture in the university hospital between 2007 and 2016.

Patients infected by influenza usually were self-limited. However, severe complications included pneumonia, myocarditis, encephalitis, septic shock and death may happen. Risk factors of mortality and microbiology profiles of patients with severe influenza remain unclear. Methods: During 2016, endemic outbreak of seasonal flu in Taiwan was detected. We retrospectively analyzed 53 patients with severe influenza and has been admitted to the ICU at a medical center during 2016 endemic in Taiwan were reviewed. All were confirmed by positive result of rtPCR for influenza, Medical records were retrospectively reviewed. Invasive bacterial infection is defined as a concomitant or superimposed bacterial infection within 14 days after influenza is diagnosed. All patients were stratified as survived and dead groups, and each variable was compared between the two groups. Multivariable logistic regression was used for outcome analysis. Results: Totally 53 patients were enrolled. Among three patients with bacteremia, the blood cultures yielded Escherichia coli (n = 1), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1), respectively. In patients with superimposed bacterial pneumonia, the most common pathogens were S. aureus (n = 3), K. pneumoniae (n = 3), Chlamydia pneumoniae (n = 2), and H. influenzae (n = 2).

Corynebacterium species other than C. diphtheriae often contaminate the culture specimen. However, severe infection has been reported for immunocompromised patients. Here, we report a case series analysis at two institutes in Japan with aim to survey clinical characteristics and prognosis of neutropenic patients with hematological malignancy suffered from Corynebacterium blood stream infection and to elucidate clinical impact of the infection. Methods: We collected data for patients with hematological malignancy who had positive blood culture test for Corynebacterium species between April 2010 and March 2016 at two affiliated hospitals of Yokohama City University. The diagnosis of Corynebacteium bacteremia was based either on the clinical manifestation of blood stream infection in the medical records or on documented Corynebacterium identification in both simultaneously replicated blood culture examination. The identification of the bacteria was performed using Walk Away 96 series, automated identification system. Results: A Twenty-two patients were documented bacteremia with Corynebacterium species. Median age was 53 years (28-72) and 17 (77.3%) were male. Baseline disease was myeloid malignancy in 16 (72.3%) and lymphoid malignancy in 6 patients, while 13 (59%) had relapsed or refractory disease. Nine patients (40.9%) had ongoing or previous history of allogenic stem cell transplantation. Nineteen patients (86.4%) presented severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <100/\u00b5L). Ten patients had oral or intestinal mucosal disruption probably due to methotrexate or transplant conditioning including whole body irradiation. Sixteen (72.8%) patients were placed central venous line catheter (CVC). The prevalence of identified Corynebacterium species was C. striatum 10, C. jeikeium 6, C. urealiticum 1 and remains unidentified. The rate of central venous catheter insertion was found in eight of ten cases (80.0%) with C. striatum bacteremic cases compared with 7 of 12 (58.3%) with other species, however which was not statistically proven (P = 0.38). Among median follow up of 7.9 months in survived patients, 13 patients died and median overall survival and one-year mortality were 2.4 months and 59%, respectively. Twelve patients died from baseline diseases, while two patients died from blood stream infection caused by Corynebacterium species. Conclusion: Corynebacterium bacteremia in neutropenic patients with hematologic malignancies had high mortality, which may reflect high risk status of baseline disease and poor general condition of the patients.

King Abdulaziz Medical City, National Guard Health Affairs, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia Background: King Abdulaziz Medical City is a 936 beds academic medical center in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. In 2012, risk assessment of TB control program was conducted for the first times that identified deficiencies in the program. The multidisciplinary approached were adopted for series of multifaceted strategies. Methods: Determination of TB infection control efforts in the utilization of a hierarchy of measures as of Administrative, Respiratory and Environmental. Review of community TB disease profile, including the epidemiologic surveillance data Statistical review of number of patient admitted at medical center with suspected or confirmed TB disease. Determination if patient with unrecognized TB disease. Determination which HCW needed to be included in the respiratory protection program. Identification of areas in the KAMC with an increased risk for healthcare-associated transmission of Myobacterium tuberculosis, e.g. ER, critical care units. Assessment of the number of airborne infection isolation rooms (AIIR) or Portable HEPA filters needed for the medical center. Survey to determine Knowledge, Attitude and Practices (KAP) of HCW before and after Implementation of TB Program. Results: A total of 3200 N95 Respirator fit testing was conducted from October 2012 -July 2015. However due to MERSCoV outbreak extra workload was assigned to nursing education for N95 Respirator fit testing. From August 2015 till October 2016, a total of 8917 staff was fit tested. This accounted 80% of all direct patient care providers. A new program was established in 2017 with train-the-trainers approach including hiring of occupational safety officer and introduction of Powered Air Purifying Respirator (PAPR). A total of 250 PAPR are now in circulation in high-risk patient care areas of the hospital. ER patient care areas including waiting areas air handling system were upgraded with introduction of 50 more portable HEPA filter machines. Dedicated Infectious Disease physician conducted round on early discharge or transfer of unnecessary isolated TB patients in ER and proper isolation of highly suspected patients. Fast triaging and ID assessment reduced overstaying of patients in ER from 48 hours to 3 hours or less. In 2015 -A total of 1,629; nurses, physician and other HCW attended educational huddles at worksite and workstation related to airborne disease and importance of N95 respirators. 550 HCW, direct patient care providers participated in KAP survey study in the Emergency Room. Prior to implementation of TB process improvement plan, KAP correct response rate was 26%. After implementation of our approach and education, correct response rate improved to 95%.

This study investigated the clinical features and bacteriology of pediatric patients with ESBL-producing E. coli bacteremia and compared their characteristics with those of adult patients. Methods: Clinical and laboratory data from all of the 41 patients aged \u226418 years diagnosed with E. coli bacteremia were collected over 5 years. Patients aged >18 years diagnosed with E. coli bacteremia, matched 1:1 for calendar time, were enrolled as the adult group. All E. coli isolates were tested for their blaCTX-M group and sequence type 131 (ST131). A novel seven-single nucleotide polymorphism-based clonotyping test was applied to detect the septatypes of each isolate. Results: In the adult group, patients with ESBL-producing E. coli bacteremia had more previous hospitalizations and antimicrobial agent use than did those with non-ESBL-producing E. coli bacteremia, but these differences were not found in pediatric group. In the pediatric group, the proportion of isolates producing CTX-M group 9 was higher than that in the adult group (85.7% vs. 42.9%; p < 0.05). Among both groups, there were more E. coli ST131 in ESBL isolates in than there were non-ESBL isolates. The distribution of septatypes was more homogenous in ESBLproducing E. coli among the pediatric patients than among the adult patients. Conclusion: ST131 was the major clone causing E. coli bacteriemia in both pediatric and adult populations. The pediatric population demonstrated a higher number of isolates producing CTX-M group 9 with more homogenous septatypes compared with the adult population.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "annex"}]}
