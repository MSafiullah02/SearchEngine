            "text": "Disulfides are the most common covalent interactions within a protein molecule involved in cross\u2010linking of sequentially distant residues. By bringing about entropic destabilization of the unfolded state, disulfides can confer stability on the protein.1, 2 Disulfide engineering is thus an important method of enhancing protein stability. Although the removal of a naturally\u2010occurring disulfide in a protein molecule results in destabilization, the introduction of a non\u2010naturally occurring disulfide bridge does not typically result in stabilization of the protein molecule.3, 4, 5 This might be a consequence of the energetic penalty required for rearrangement of residues surrounding the cysteines to accommodate the disulfide, as well as due to loss of favorable interactions involving the original wild\u2010type (WT) residues.2 Alternatively, the conformational characteristics of the disulfide formed might be energetically unfavorable. A study of cross\u2010strand disulfides in antiparallel \u03b2\u2010sheets had previously shown that while disulfides formed at the non\u2010hydrogen bonded registered pairs are stabilizing, those in the hydrogen bonded positions are destabilizing.5, 6 Hence, an understanding of disulfides in the context of protein structures could provide valuable information for protein engineering. Engineered disulfides can also act as conformational constraints and to validate protein models.7 Hence, it is important to understand the conformational determinants of disulfides formed within and between different types of secondary structures.",

Minor variations in the fold structure and active site leads to a diverse collection of proteins with varying functions.24 Homology searches for oxidoreductases carrying CXXC motifs has revealed the presence of proteins with CXXC derived sequences like CXXS, CXXT, TXXC, and SXXC.

The values of torsion angle ranges used for identifying helical residues were \u2212120\u00b0 to \u221210\u00b0, and \u2212120\u00b0 to 20\u00b0 for \u03d5 and \u03c8, respectively.

Depending on the geometry of the modeled disulfide, the predicted sites are graded as A, B, and C by MODIP in descending order of stereochemical quality. Consistent with observations of naturally\u2010occurring intrahelical disulfides, all sites identified by MODIP also required the N\u2010terminal residue of the predicted site to have a non\u2010helical conformation. This residue was the N\u2010Cap of the helical segment. The number of residues (loop length) between the two potential cysteines varied from 0\u20134 with the maximum number of sites identified for a loop length of two. Although there are no A grade disulfides when loop length is zero, there are predicted disulfides with A grade for other loop lengths of 1\u20134. The above findings are consistent with those for naturally\u2010occurring disulfides. Disulfide formation is not possible in the interior or towards the C\u2010terminus of a helix because the C\n\u03b2\u2013C\n\u03b2 distances between residues are incompatible with disulfide formation.

The \u03b1\u2010helices designated as \u03b11\u2013\u03b14 (as defined in the PDB\u2010ID 2trx) are from residues 11\u201317, 32\u201349, 59\u201363, and 95\u2013107, respectively. Each of the residues at N\u2010termini have non\u2010helical (\u03d5, \u03c8) values of (\u221289.1\u00b0, \u22126.8\u00b0), (\u221290.2\u00b0, 108.7\u00b0), (\u221279.1\u00b0, 118.0\u00b0), and (\u221285.2\u00b0, 162.9\u00b0), respectively, for residues 11, 32, 59, and 95. The residues 11, 32, 59, and 95 are the N\u2010Cap residues of the helices in thioredoxin. Of the four helices described above, it is already known that \u03b11 is disordered and a disulfide occurs at the N\u2010terminus of \u03b12 in WT Trx. We therefore, attempted to introduce disulfides at the N\u2010terminus of helices \u03b13 and \u03b14, respectively. Since analysis of PDB structures showed that glycine and proline are the preferred amino acids at positions 2 and 3 of the CXXC motif, additional mutants were made incorporating these residues. Finally, to study if disulfides could be formed at non N\u2010Cap helical positions, CYS pairs were also introduced at positions 1,4 in \u03b13 and \u03b14 as well as positions 7,10 in \u03b14. This could theoretically occur if there was a change in the helix start site in the mutant protein. Since our aim was to check if disulfide formation at engineered CXXC sites could be used to probe helix start sites in proteins of unknown structure, it was important to include these positions. Thioredoxin contains two active site cysteines at positions 32 and 35. These were mutated to serines to yield nSS Trx and additional intrahelical pairs of CYS residues were introduced into this mutant background. Following expression and purification from E. coli, the redox status of the introduced CYS residues was examined by iodoacetamide labeling. Iodoacetamide will react only with reduced CYS residues, and the resultant acetylated product will result in a mass increase of 57 Da per acetylation. The results are summarized in Table VII. Iodoacetamide labeling studies confirmed that while N\u2010Cap\u20103 disulfides formed spontaneously, the 1\u20104 disulfides did not form until subjected to more oxidizing conditions in the presence of 1,10\u2010phenanthroline monohydrate.42 This shows that the N\u2010Cap\u20103 positions of a helix are poised to form the disulfide as observed in naturally\u2010occurring intrahelical disulfides. The absence of spontaneous disulfide formation in the 1\u20134 positions further reiterates the importance of the N\u2010terminal CYS residue to be non\u2010helical for disulfide formation. The mutant with the disulfide in the 7\u201310 position formed a intermolecular disulfide leading to dimer formation and is described in more detail elsewhere46 and this mutant was not used further in the present work. Mass spectrometry and SDS\u2010PAGE in the absence of a reducing agent confirmed that engineered cysteines were not involved in the formation of intermolecular disulfides with the exception of the 7\u201310 mutant (Trx F102C A105C) described above.",

All oxidized mutants had lower values of C\nm and T\nm relative to nSS Trx. Both chemical and thermal melts were analyzed assuming two\u2010state denaturation. In all cases, the transitions fit well to a two\u2010state model. A more rigorous demonstration would involve monitoring chemical denaturation with an independent probe such as tryptophan fluorescence as was done for WT Trx in the oxidized state.52 In the case of reduced thioredoxin, the baselines obtained by monitoring fluorescence in a chemical melt have large slopes. Hence, denaturation of reduced thioredoxin is typically monitored by CD as is done in the present work for nSS Trx. Thus, we have not conclusively shown that denaturation of nSS Trx and its derivatives is two\u2010state. However, this does not alter any of the principal conclusions derived from the data in Table VIII, namely that the engineered intrahelical disulfides in nSS Trx are all destabilizing. The extent of destabilization depends on the identity of the residues in the CXXC motif. In addition, forcible formation of a disulfide at non N\u2010terminal helical positions is highly destabilizing.",

Hence, it was of interest to examine if the thioredoxin mutants carrying engineered intrahelical CXXC motifs can display thioredoxin like redox activity. Thioredoxin catalyzes the reduction of insulin by DTT. Upon reduction, the insulin B chain aggregates and this can be monitored by light scattering at 650 nm. All the CXXC mutants (N\u2010Cap\u20103 and 1\u20134 disulfide mutants) show varying degrees of activity (see Fig. 7). However, all mutants have activities lower than WT Trx. This reduced level of activity is expected since the active site helix of thioredoxin is evolutionarily optimized for redox activity. Further, recent studies have shown that the conserved cis\u2010proline loop in thioredoxin plays an important role in its substrate specificity and activity.53 Surprisingly, there was no clear correlation between the position of the CXXC motif in the helix with respect to the level of activity. Expectedly, nSS Trx that lacks cysteine residues showed no activity. Control proteins MBP 230C 30C and Trx 20C 73C contain two CYS residues such that the cysteine C\n\u03b1 atoms are separated by 35.3 \u00c5 and 27.3 \u00c5 apart in the structures of WT MBP and WT Trx, respectively.

Experimental studies with E. coli thioredoxin showed that disulfides could be introduced at the N\u2010termini of two different helices. The engineered disulfides did not increase protein stability, probably because the favorable interactions involving the WT residues are lost upon substitution with cysteines. However, the mutants showed redox activity in an insulin reduction assay. It is, therefore, possible to engineer such intrahelical disulfides and such engineered intrahelical disulfides can confer redox activity on a protein. In cases where the three dimensional structure is unknown, such engineered disulfides might also be used to experimentally determine the location of helix start sites. CYS can potentially be replaced by selenocysteine. This suggests the possibility of using engineered diselenide derivatives to obtain phase information by anomalous scattering. In contrast to the commonly used selenomethionine derivatives, such diselenides may be better ordered.",
