However, no significant difference in antibody prevalence was found between surgeons wearing masks versus those who occasionally or never wore surgical masks.26 Surgical masks were not effective at reducing internal deposition of Technetium-99 metastable, an aerosolized radiopharmaceutic, in nuclear medicine personnel and did not significantly reduce latex particle inhalation in a study of 20 health care workers.27, 28 A surgical and laser mask showed similar fit factors of 3.0 (95% CI: 1.8-4.2) and 3.8 (95% CI: 2.9-4.6), much less than the fit factor of 102.6 (95% CI: 41.2-164) for a FFP2 respirator.29 A recent study found a geometric mean fit factor of 2.6 (geometric SD, 1.6) for 6 surgical masks, using a TSI Portacount device with an N95 Companion.30\n",

Our data, however, are consistent for all 20 subjects, suggesting that most people will experience similar low levels of fit. Our quantitative fit tests employed a TSI Portacount device without a N95 companion.11 The latter instrument selects a narrower range of particles to minimize the contribution of filter penetration to the measurement of fit. We sought to minimize this by including in the fit test experiments only surgical masks with filter penetration less than 0.6% at all 3 test particle sizes. In addition, our findings are similar to those of a recent study using the N95 companion.30\n",

If health care institutions continue to expend resources on surgical masks for both purposes, we strongly urge the FDA to employ a more robust regulatory approach to their approval.
