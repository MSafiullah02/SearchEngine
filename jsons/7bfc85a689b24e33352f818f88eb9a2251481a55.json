It has been observed that elderly individuals and those with medical co-morbidities are maximally affected. In children and adolescents, coronavirus infection has low mortality as well as the severity of symptoms are less. Children and adolescents with immunocompromised state, malnutrition, medical co-morbidities and poor hygiene are at higher risk of contracting coronavirus infection. Minimizing this risk factors and adopting appropriate prevention measures will be helpful in limiting the spread of infection as there is no specific treatment and immunization available to date to address this serious issue.

The above data depict the grievousness of the endemic in the contemporary world. People of all ages are affected with the deadly coronavirus infection, though the risk of infection is higher among older people and those with medical co-morbidities (Wu et al. 2020a) .

Though children and adolescents have lower death rate, they can be potential agents of transmission. As the degree of mobility is higher in this age group of population, the probability of contracting infection and transmitting to others (particularly the high-risk population of elderly) is high. Children infected with coronavirus often present with fever, cough and breathing difficulties. Many children also report vomiting, diarrhoea and the aforementioned symptoms (Yang et al. 2020 ). Children born from infected mothers have higher risk of contracting the infection from mother (Yang et al. 2020) . The clinical symptoms and investigation findings in children with coronavirus infection often resemble with viral pneumonia (Yang et al. 2020) . It has been reported that children often have milder symptoms than adults and the elderly (Chen et al. 2020a ; American Academy of Pediatrics 2020; Lu and Shi 2020). The biochemical changes and chest computed tomography (CT) changes of children with coronavirus infection also differ from those of adults (Xia et al. 2020 ). Children often have more upper respiratory infection than lower respiratory infection, which increases their ability to transmit the infection (American Academy of Pediatrics 2020). A report mentions that even an apparently healthy infant had heavy viral load which indicates that children can even transmit infection without manifesting the illness (Kam et al. 2020 ).",

As there is no definite treatment to date for this illness, prevention becomes the top priority. The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention had issued certain instructions in the public interest that intends to create awareness among the public about coronavirus infection and its prevention among children (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2020). As small children may not be able to take their own responsibility, parents, teachers and sensitive citizens of this civilized society should take responsibility to prevent the spread of coronavirus infection. They need to monitor the activities of children at home, school and outside the home setting. There is a need to restrict large group activities, limit play time and keep distance during play and interaction. Similarly in the home and school setting, there is a need to keep the surfaces and objects (walls, toilets, chairs, tables, boards, play items, reading materials) sanitized through repeated cleaning as these remain the medium of transfer of pathogens from infected individuals to healthy ones (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2020). Choosing outdoor game in small groups may be more beneficial than indoor games as the ventilation is better outside and the possibility of maintaining distance during play is higher in outdoor play. Group travel, picnics and study tours are to be strictly discouraged. Children need to be taught about hygiene regularly, and they need to be monitored for the implementation of hygiene in practice.",
