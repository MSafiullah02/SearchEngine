For smoothing, the final weekly R is the geometric mean of the daily values in the preceding, current, and following weeks (3- week moving average). We discarded the first three and last three weekly R estimates. To avoid unstable R estimates resulting from periods of low coronavirus activity, we limited our analysis to \"in-season\" estimates. Seasons were defined as To measure the relative contribution of depletion of susceptibles compared to seasonal forcing in the observed data, we adapted a linear regression model as follows (36): where Rsij is the weekly effective reproduction number for strain s in week i of season j, R0 is the basic reproduction number, S0 is the fraction of susceptibles at the start of the first season for the reference strain (HCoV-HKU1), and \u03f5sij is a normally distributed error term. A dummy variable for each additional strain-season combination (\u0251sj) captures differences in the reproduction number and the starting fraction of susceptibles between strains and over time, but is unable to distinguish between the two. Both R0 and the fraction of susceptibles may vary by strain and season. If R0 is assumed to be similar at the start of each season and between the strains, then the dummy variables can be interpreted as differences in immunity. The next two terms estimate the impact of depletion of susceptibles due to infection by the same strain (dsij) and the other betacoronavirus strain (drij). Depletion of susceptibles for each strain was estimated up to a proportionality constant by the cumulative sum of the incidence proxy over season j through week i. The coefficient on the first term (\u03bbs) represents the scaling factor between the cumulative incidence proxy and true depletion of susceptibles, while \u03b4s captures the level of cross-immunity in addition to scaling; both coefficients were allowed to vary by strain. Because specific seasonal drivers (e.g. absolute humidity) of seasonal variation in coronavirus transmission have not been identified, we did not include them in our model but used a cubic basis spline with knots every four weeks to capture fluctuations in seasonal forcing over the year. Bn represents the ten basis functions for a cubic spline with seven internal knots and no intercept, and \u03b8n the coefficients corresponding to each of these functions. Dynamic transmission model. We implemented a two-strain ordinary differential equation (ODE) susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered-susceptible (SEIRS) compartmental model to describe the transmission dynamics of HCoV-OC43 ('strain 1') and HCoV-HKU1 ('strain 2') in the United States.",

Immunity waned at rates \u03c31 and \u03c32 for HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1, respectively. The basic reproduction number, R0, was assumed to be seasonal with a period of 52 weeks, specified by the equation where max(R0) is the maximum wintertime value of R0, f is the proportional decline in R0 that occurs in the summer (f=0 denotes constant R0 throughout the year), and \u03a6 is the phase shift in weeks.

The model was run for 24.5 years to allow the dynamics to reach a steady state, and then the simulated incidence of Strain 1 and Strain 2 were compared with the percent test-positives multiplied by percent of clinic visits for ILI for HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1, respectively, after scaling the simulated prevalence by a factor \u03c8. This scaling factor accounts for the difference between % ILI times % positive tests (the units of the data) and the actual prevalence of infection. Model fit was assessed by the SSE between the data and the \u03c8-scaled simulated prevalence of infection for each strain after taking the logarithm of both. The SSE is proportional to the log likelihood, assuming normal-distributed errors. QQ-plots of the residuals between the data and the model fit support the assumption of normality ( Figure S5) . To determine the parameter values consistent with HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 transmission, we used latin hypercube sampling (LHS) (59) to simulate transmission for 100,000 combinations of the model parameters sampled uniformly from the ranges reported in Table 1 . We then used the Nelder-Mead algorithm as implemented in Mathematica's \"NMaximize\" function to refine the minimum SSE estimate from the LHS sample. These parameter values are listed in Table S8 . We were unable to robustly estimate confidence intervals for the estimated parameters because the likelihood surface is jagged due to frequent bifurcations in the model solutions ( Figure S6) . These bifurcations arise due to the competition between strains, which can cause the phase of the outbreaks (e.g. whether major HCoV-OC43 outbreaks occur on even or odd years) to shift suddenly as the parameter values change. Instead, we note that the estimated parameter values lie in epidemiologically reasonable ranges, provide a good fit to the incidence data (Figure 2A Next, we incorporated a third strain into the dynamic transmission model to represent SARS-CoV-2, following the same structure as the model depicted in Figure S4 . We simulated transmission of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 for 20 years and then simulated the establishment of sustained SARS-CoV-2 transmission using another half-week pulse in the force of infection. We assumed that the latent period for SARS-CoV-2 was 4.6 days (37-39) and the infectious period was 5 days, informed by the estimates for the other betacoronaviruses (see Table S8 ). We allowed the cross immunity from SARS-CoV-2 to the other betacoronaviruses and vice-versa to range from 0 to 1, the duration of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 to range from 40 weeks to permanent, the seasonal variation in R0 to vary between none and 40%, and the establishment time to vary throughout 2020. To adjust the amount of seasonal variation in R0, we held the maximum wintertime value of the sinusoid fixed and adjusted the minimum summertime (baseline) value.",

To assess the effect of non-exponential waiting times, we introduced four additional 'dummy' compartments into each internal state of the model (i.e. all states except 'susceptible' and 'recovered') so that the waiting times were gamma-distributed ( Figure S17 ). The exit rates from each compartment were multiplied by five so that the mean duration in each state remained the same as in the model with exponential waiting times. Table S1 . Estimated regression model coefficients. The intercept represents the natural log of the effective reproduction number (R0 times fraction susceptible) for HCoV-HKU1 at the start of the 2014-15 season, and each \u0251sj parameter represents the difference in log effective reproduction number for strain s at the start of season j compared to this reference. The \u03bbs parameters represent the effect of the depletion of susceptibles of strain s (in incidence proxy units) on the effective reproduction number, and the \u03b4s parameters represent the effect of the depletion of susceptibles of the opposite strain. The \u03b8 parameters are the coefficients of the basis spline.",

Epidemiological compartments are represented by the bold letter-number pairs, such that an individual in compartment S1S2 is susceptible to both strains, while a person in compartment I1E2 is infectious with strain 1 and has been exposed to strain 2. Filled circles represent death and the open circle represents births. Transition rates are given next to the arrows between compartments. Estimated parameter values are listed in Table S8 . (Table S8 ) and establishment is on 11 March 2020. High cross immunity from HCoVs OC43/HKU1 against SARS-CoV-2 would lead to fewer cumulative SARS-CoV-2 infections (A) and a lower peak SARS-CoV-2 prevalence (B). Intermediate cross immunity from HCoVs OC43/HKU1 against SARS-CoV-2 leads to high peak prevalence (B) because cross immunity is high enough to push the SARS-CoV-2 peak to the winter, but not high enough to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection altogether. High R0 and low seasonality are both associated with higher cumulative SARS-CoV-2 infections (C) and higher peak SARS-CoV-2 prevalence (D). Quicklywaning immunity (\u03c33) is strongly associated with high cumulative SARS-CoV-2 infections (E), while autumn/winter establishment is strongly associated with high peak SARS-CoV-2 prevalence (F). Long incubation and infectious periods are associated with a high cumulative number of infections (G), while epidemic peak size is maximized for short latent periods and long infectious periods (H).

Infected individuals then proceed to an exposed (E) state, after which a proportion pR = 0.956 enters the 'recovery' arm, pH = 0.0308 enters the 'hospitalization' arm, and pC = 0.0132 enters the 'critical care' arm. Exposed individuals become infectious (I) at rate \u03bd = 1/4.6 days. Individuals in the recovery arm then recover (R) at rate ! = 1/5 days, but individuals in the hospitalization arm must pass through the hospitalization state (H) and individuals in the critical care arm must pass through both the hospitalization (H) and critical care (C) states.

The scenarios were obtained by varying the cross immunity between SARS-CoV-2 and HCoVs OC43/HKU1 (\u03c73X) and vice-versa (\u03c7X3), the duration of SARS-CoV-2 immunity (1/\u03c33), and the seasonal variation in R0 (f), assuming an epidemic establishment time of 11 March 2020 (depicted as a vertical grey bar). Parameter values used to generate each plot are listed below; all other parameters were held at the values listed inTable S8. (A) A short duration (1/\u03c33 = 40 weeks) of SARS-CoV-2 immunity could yield annual SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks. (B) Longer-term SARS-CoV-2 immunity (1/\u03c33 = 104 weeks) could yield biennial outbreaks, possibly with smaller outbreaks in the intervening years. (C) Higher seasonal variation in transmission (f = 0.4) would reduce the peak size of the invasion wave, but could lead to more severe wintertime outbreaks thereafter (compare with (B)). (D) Long-term immunity (1/\u03c33 = infinity) to SARS-CoV-2 could lead to elimination of the virus.
