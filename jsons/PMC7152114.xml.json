            "text": "The in vivo mechanism of action of leflunomide may depend on factors such as drug levels, disposable uridine pools, and the immune activation pathway involved. Studies have indicated that, in addition to inhibition of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, leflunomide and the MNAs may act through inhibition of tyrosine kinases. Phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor of human fibroblasts has been shown to be inhibited by leflunomide.160 It was shown that leflunomide directly inhibited the interleukin (IL)-2-stimulated protein tyrosine kinase activity of p56lck and p59fyn,160 which is associated with activation through the T-cell receptor/CD3 complex. At higher concentrations, A771726 also inhibited IL-2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Janus kinase (JAK)1 and JAK3 protein tyrosine kinases.60 Leflunomide analogues have also been shown to possess strong inhibitory activity on the antiapoptotic tyrosine kinase Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase, a key factor for T-cell-independent antibody formation.150 The hypothesis that leflunomide may exhibit more than one mechanism of action in vivo was further illustrated in mice where uridine restored proliferation and IgM production by lipopolysaccharide-stimulated B cells, whereas suppression of IgG production was not reversed. This phenomenon correlated in a dose-dependent manner with tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK3 and STAT6 proteins, known to be involved in IL-4-induced signal transduction pathways.228 This double in vivo mechanism of action was confirmed in rats, in which xenoreactivity was counteracted by the administration of uridine, whereas alloreactivity was not.42\n",

In a prospective study, 26 renal transplant recipients with biopsy-proven BKVN were treated with leflunomide in combination with discontinuation of MMF and reduction of tacrolimus to a 4\u20136 ng/mL range.287 Although the leflunomide levels were in the lower range (on average 50 mg/mL), a significant reduction in serum and urine BKV titers was obtained, allograft function stabilized, and the overall graft loss rates because of BKV were only 15%.115 Less encouraging results were obtained in another prospective open-label study in which viral clearance was only obtained in 40% of patients with significant toxicity, resulting in discontinuation of the drug in 17% of patients.66 The contribution of reduction of immunosuppressive agents and leflunomide to the efficacy of BKVN treatment is unclear at this moment.59,\n114,\n265 Based on recent in vitro data, it has been suggested that the combination of sirolimus with leflunomide might be an effective treatment approach.140 FK778 has also been studied in the context of BKVN, but although it was able to decrease BK viral load, FK778 treatment was associated with more acute rejections, decreased renal function, and more adverse events compared with reduction of immunosuppression.94\n",

Furthermore, the expression of CYP27B1 in immune cells is controlled by immune signals. For example, CYP27B1 expression by monocytes/macrophages is upregulated by interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), lipopolysaccharide, Mycobacterium tuberculosis-derived 19 kDa lipoprotein and viral infections. Moreover, CYP27B1 expression in macrophages and dendritic cells is not suppressed by 1,25(OH)2D3 itself, allowing for massive local production of 1,25(OH)2D3 by macrophages in patients with granulomatous diseases. As an alternative negative-feedback loop 1,25(OH)2D3 upregulates CYP24 in immune cells.56\n",

In the NOD mouse, upregulation of regulator cells and a shift away from Th1 towards Th2 could be observed in 1,25(OH)2D3-treated mice, both locally in the pancreas as well as in the peripheral immune system.90,\n179 Moreover, a restoration of the defective sensitivity to apoptosis characteristic for NOD T lymphocytes was observed, resulting in a better elimination of autoreactive effector cells.33,\n51 This increased sensitivity to apoptosis has been described for different apoptosis-inducing signals. This mechanism may explain why an early and short-term 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment before the clinical onset of autoimmunity can lead to long-term protection and restoration of self-tolerance.",

Compared to tacrolimus, both CP-690,550 groups showed similar rates of acute rejection episodes and allograft function, but experienced greater incidences of hyperlipidemia and infections (suggestive of additional JAK2 inhibition).31 A phase IIB trial compared cyclosporine at standard dosage versus CP-690,550 15 mg twice a day for 6 months then 10 mg twice a day, or CP-690,550 15 mg twice a day for 3 months then 10 mg twice a day.

Given the side effects reported with the use of CP-690,550, the challenge remains to develop immunosuppressive drugs with truly selective inhibition of JAK3 versus JAK2 activities.

The safety and efficacy of photopheresis in the prevention of acute rejection of cardiac allografts have been evaluated in primary cardiac allograft recipients, randomly assigned to standard triple-drug immunosuppressive therapy (cyclosporine, azathioprine, and prednisone) alone or in conjunction with 24 photopheresis sessions performed during the first 6 months after transplantation. After 6 months of follow-up, photopheresis-treated patients developed significantly fewer multiple rejections, and there were no significant differences in the rates or types of infection. Although there was no significant effect on graft survival rates at 6 or 12 months, this study indicated that photopheresis may be an effective new immunosuppressive regimen in transplant recipients.13 In patients with refractory bronchiolitis obliterans after lung transplantation, photopheresis resulted in a stabilization of graft function and/or in some of these patients in histological reversal of rejection.173,\n212\n",
