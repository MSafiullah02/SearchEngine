When considering well-being in this setting, a central component is meeting basic daily needs, such as housing, food, and personal safety. Under typical circumstances, most health care workers are able to meet these needs with relative ease. However, in the current setting, these basic essentials are threatened.",

As schools and daycare centers have closed across the city (and tri-state area), childcare for frontline health care workers has also proven a conundrum. The city has opened centers to care for the children of health care workers, and our institution has created a volunteer program to offer childcare to essential clinical staff by linking them with nonessential employees and other resources.",

The MSHS housing and real estate team has been working internally and with local hotels and institutions to procure accommodations for these scenarios. Finally, in busy clinical units with critically ill patients, our clinicians and staff have found it difficult to leave the unit for food. As such, our institution has responded by exploring ways to bring nourishment directly to our hardest-hit units.",

Other messaging has addressed the near-universal concerns around resources to meet basic needs. The task force also developed and provided the communications team with \u201cwellness messages,\u201d informed by mental health experts, to provide suggestions and tools for managing expected COVID-19-related anxiety.

At the time of writing, health care workers are working under conditions in which disease case counts are increasing exponentially, concerns are growing that supplies of critical care equipment and PPE are inadequate, and the surrounding city is increasingly under lockdown conditions. While our health system made available and provided numerous psychosocial and mental health support resources before the pandemic (e.g., Employee Assistance Program, psychiatry services, spiritual care), the enormous stress and emotional strain on both clinicians and nonclinical employees has prompted the task force to scale up existing resources and provide additional resources. These include an array of offerings that range from simple self-care resources (e.g., mindfulness activities) to virtual support groups facilitated by social workers and psychologists and to one-on-one counseling sessions and 24/7 immediate crisis management. To increase the capacity of existing support and develop new initiatives, trained mental health staff have shifted their responsibilities or volunteered their time to meet these needs.",

The task force has used a work group strategy to review and operationalize plans for each of the priority areas (Table 1). In addition, task force members have maintained close connections with system, hospital, and departmental leaders, as well as with health care workers in the field caring for patients. The OWBR\u2019s existing infrastructure of well-being champions embedded within clinical departments and residency training programs has allowed for real-time access to understanding the challenges and concerns of physicians, while nursing and advanced practice provider leaders have captured the needs of their constituents\u2014all in an effort to funnel concerns through the task force to leadership to inform resource allocation and communications.",
