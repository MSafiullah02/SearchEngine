The etiological agent, PRRS virus (PRRSV) (family Arteriviridae, order Nidovirales), has a positive-polarity single-stranded RNA genome, approximately 15 kb in length, encoding two nonstructural polyproteins (ORF1ab and ORF1b) and eight structural proteins (GP2, E, GP3, GP4, GP5, ORF5a, M, and N) (3, 4). After being cleaved by four virus-encoded proteases, nonstructural protein 1\u03b1 (nsp1\u03b1), nsp1\u03b2, nsp2, and nsp4, the two polyproteins are further cleaved into individual nonstructural proteins that perform different functions during the viral life cycle (5). To reproduce rapidly and establish a persistent infection in pigs, PRRSV has developed the ability to resist host interferon (IFN) signaling, which is the key signaling pathway for innate immune responses against viral invasion or replication (1, 6, 7).",

            "text": "Innate immune responses are activated by host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which recognize molecular structures called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that are structurally conserved within a large number of pathogenic organisms (8). Upon recognition of PAMPs, PRRs initiate signaling pathways that ultimately trigger the production of type I IFNs. Subsequently, the Janus kinase/signal transduction and transcription activator (JAK/STAT) pathway is activated by type I IFNs (9, 10). Briefly, type I IFNs bind to their surface receptors (IFNAR1 and IFNAR2) and then activate and phosphorylate the two intracellular tyrosine kinases Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2). These activated tyrosine kinases mainly phosphorylate two transcription factors, namely, signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT2, which interact with IFN regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) to form IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) (11). The transcription factor complex ISGF3 (STAT1/STAT2/IRF9) is transported to the nucleus, where it recognizes IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs), leading to the induction of hundreds of IFN-stimulating genes (ISGs) (12). Many ISGs function as potent antiviral effectors, directly preventing viral infections by targeting viral processes such as viral entry, viral genome replication, viral protein synthesis, or viral body release (13).",

            "text": "During coevolution with their hosts, many viruses have developed elaborate strategies to circumvent the JAK/STAT pathway in IFN signaling (14). Among several known viral evasion strategies, targeting the transcription factor complex ISGF3 is a particularly powerful means of inactivating IFN signaling, because this strategy effectively inhibits common downstream ISG expression. For example, our recent study showed that porcine deltacoronavirus blocks the JAK/STAT pathway by 3C-like protease-mediated cleavage of STAT2 (15). The nonstructural protein 1 (NSP1) of rotavirus mediates the degradation of IRF9 by targeting the C-proximal IRF-binding domain and inhibits IFN-mediated phosphorylation of STAT1 (16, 17). Sendai virus C protein binds STAT1 to block the formation of STAT1/STAT2 heterodimers or STAT1/STAT1 homodimers, which inhibit IFN signaling (18). Previous studies have shown that PRRSV nsp11 inhibits type I IFN production through nidovirus-specific endoribonuclease (NendoU) activity-dependent mechanisms (19\u201321). However, the NendoU activity of overexpressed nsp11 unexpectedly exhibited extensive substrate specificity in vitro and is extremely toxic to prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, indicating that the inhibition of IFN production by wild-type (WT) PRRSV nsp11 may be due to its cytotoxicity (21). Here, we found that PRRSV nsp11 also inhibits ISRE promoter activity and the transcription of ISGs, thereby interfering with the type I IFN signaling pathway. Importantly, mutations that eliminate NendoU activity and its cytotoxicity in nsp11 retain the ability to block IFN signaling. Detailed analysis showed that nsp11 inhibited type I IFN signaling by targeting IRF9, a key molecule in the ISGF3 complex, revealing a potential novel function of PRRSV nsp11 in type I IFN signaling.",

            "text": "In arterivirus, the nsp11 endoribonuclease is important for viral replication (19, 21, 23\u201326). Several previous studies have shown that PRRSV nsp11 inhibits type I IFN production in a NendoU activity-dependent manner (19\u201321). We considered such a possibility for PRRSV nsp11-mediated inhibition of type I IFN signaling to be associated also with its NendoU activity. On the basis of their chemical properties and known residue requirements, the three catalytic residues of endoribonucleases (His129, His144, and Lys173 [numbering based on PRRSV nsp11]) were shown to be directly involved in catalysis (21, 23, 25). Thus, three endoribonuclease catalytic residue mutations, His129Ala (H129A), His144Ala (H144A), and Lys173Ala (K173A), were introduced into PRRSV nsp11 and the corresponding eukaryotic expression plasmids expressing the N-terminally HA-tagged nsp11 endoribonuclease inactive mutants were constructed. To test whether the HA-tagged nsp11 mutants lose endoribonuclease activity, HA-tagged WT nsp11 and three mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant proteins were purified (Fig. 2A), and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assays were performed to detect the endoribonuclease activity. As shown in Fig. 2B, the levels of endoribonuclease activity of the three HA-tagged nsp11 mutants were significantly decreased compared with the WT nsp11 (Fig. 2B). However, none of the endoribonuclease inactive mutants (H129A, H144A, or K173A) showed a loss of the ability of nsp11 to inhibit ISRE promoter activity in cells overexpressing HA-tagged nsp11 mutants (Fig. 2C). We also used PRRSV nsp9 as a negative control and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) nsp15 as a positive control. In agreement with a previous study (27), PEDV WT nsp15 suppressed IFN-\u03b1-induced ISRE promoter activity whereas such an inhibitory effect was not observed in cells expressing a PEDV nsp15 endoribonuclease inactive mutant (H226A) or PRRSV nsp9 (Fig. 2C). These data suggest that although the NendoU activity of PEDV nsp15 is important for inhibiting IFN signaling, PRRSV nsp11 does not depend on the NendoU activity. We further tested the ability of nsp11 mutants to inhibit IFN-\u03b1-induced ISG expression. As shown in Fig. 2D, each endoribonuclease inactive mutant (H129A, H144A, or K173A) of nsp11 also inhibited the IFN-\u03b1-induced transcription of ISGs. Since these three mutants are also devoid of cell cytotoxicity (21), our results indicated that the inhibition of IFN signaling observed in nsp11-expressing cells is independent of its endoribonuclease activity and cell cytotoxicity.",

Given the pivotal role of the transcription factor complex ISGF3 in type I IFN signaling, we further investigated whether overexpression of nsp11 inhibits ISGF3-mediated signaling. As shown in Fig. 3, coexpression of the components of transcription factor complex ISGF3 (STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9) significantly activated the ISRE promoter compared with the results seen with the empty plasmid control. However, activation of the ISRE promoter by ISGF3 was significantly inhibited in the presence of PRRSV nsp11 (Fig. 3). Similarly to the results seen with WT nsp11, each endoribonuclease inactive mutant (H129A, H144A, or K173A) was also able to suppress the ISGF3-mediated IRES promoter (Fig. 3), suggesting that the endoribonuclease activity of nsp11 does not govern the ability of nsp11 to block the activity of the ISGF3-induced IRES promoter. Consequently, we speculated that PRRSV nsp11 might target the ISGF3 complex to inhibit type I IFN signaling.",

To investigate whether PRRSV nsp11 alters the STAT1 and STAT2 phosphorylation status after IFN-\u03b1 stimulation, lysates from nsp11-expressing cells were subjected to Western blotting using phospho-STAT1 (STAT1-Y701) and phospho-STAT2 (STAT2-Y690) antibodies (Abs), respectively. The levels of phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2 were greatly increased after IFN-\u03b1 treatment, and no difference in the levels was found between nsp11-expressing cells and nsp11-nonexpressing cells (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and 4). Similarly, nsp11 mutants lacking endoribonuclease activity (H129A, H144A, and K173A) had no effect on the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 (Fig. 4 [compare lane 3 to lanes 5 to 7]).

To test this hypothesis, HEK-293T cells were transfected with the indicated nsp11 expression plasmids and then treated with IFN-\u03b1. The PRRSV nsp11 protein and phosphorylated STAT1/STAT2 (STAT1-Y701 and STAT2-Y690) were immunoprecipitated with an anti-IRF9 antibody. As shown in Fig. 6A, IFN-\u03b1 treatment significantly induced the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2, and IRF9 efficiently pulled down phosphorylated STAT1/STAT2 after IFN-\u03b1 treatment (compare lanes 1 and 3). However, the amount of phosphorylated STAT1/STAT2 that bound to IRF9 remarkably decreased in the presence of PRRSV nsp11 and its mutants (H129A, H144A, and K173A) (Fig. 6A, lanes 3 and 4 to 7).",

Indeed, our data revealed that the PRRSV nsp11 mutants (H129A, H144A, and K173A) still significantly inhibited the IFN-induced formation and nuclear accumulation of ISGF3 and did so to similar extents (Fig. 6B [compare lanes 5 to 7 and lanes 12 to 14]).

African green monkey kidney cells (Marc-145) were infected with PRRSV for 24 h and then collected at 4 h after IFN-\u03b1 treatment for immunoprecipitation with anti-nsp11 or anti-IRF9 antibodies to detect the interaction between nsp11 and endogenous IRF9. As shown in Fig. 7A, nsp11 was coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous IRF9 in PRRSV-infected cells. Furthermore, phosphorylated STAT1/STAT2 was also coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous IRF9 upon IFN-\u03b1 stimulation. However, the formation of STAT1/STAT2/IRF9 heterotrimers was significantly inhibited following PRRSV infection (Fig. 7A [compare lanes 3 and 4]). To further address whether the IFN-induced nuclear accumulation of ISGF3 was also affected by PRRSV infection, nuclear and cytoplasmic fractionation was performed. Compared with uninfected cells, the levels of STAT1-Y701, STAT2-Y690, and IRF9 proteins were reduced in the nuclear fraction of PRRSV-infected cells after IFN-\u03b1 stimulation (Fig. 7B [compare lanes 3 to 4 and lanes 7 to 8]). Immunofluorescence experiments showed that PRRSV infection inhibited IFN-induced nuclear accumulation of STAT1-Y701 (Fig. 7C), STAT2-Y690 (Fig. 7D), and IRF9 proteins (Fig. 7E) compared to mock-infected cells. In PRRSV-infected cells with IFN stimulation, nsp11 and IRF9 were primarily colocated in the cytoplasm (Fig. 7E). Together, these data indicated that PRRSV infection inhibits the formation and nuclear accumulation of ISGF3 through the nsp11-IRF9 interaction, which was consistent with the results of gene transfection experiments in cells expressing PRRSV nsp11.",

            "text": "During coevolution with their hosts, many viruses have acquired mechanisms to circumvent host innate immune responses. Of note, PRRSV infection has been found to produce abnormally low levels of type I IFNs and to inhibit the ability of type I IFNs to induce antiviral responses (1, 38). The endoribonuclease encoded within the PRRSV nsp11 sequence, which has the uridylate-preferred cleavage site for RNA that is necessary for virus replication, has been found to be a multifunctional protein (19, 21). Previously, it has been demonstrated that PRRSV nsp11 is involved in the inhibition of IFN production through multiple distinct mechanisms, as follows. (i) nsp11 represses the transcription of type I IFNs by inhibiting the activation of transcription factors IRF3 and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB), which directly activate the promoters of type I IFNs (19, 20). (ii) nsp11 reduces the levels of transcripts and proteins of mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), two critical factors in the IFN induction pathway (19). (iii) nsp11 removes the ubiquitin chains from I\u03baB\u03b1 (inhibitor of NF-\u03baB alpha), thereby preventing the proteasomal degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 and subsequent liberation of NF-\u03baB (39). (iv) nsp11 recruits the OTU deubiquitinase with linear linkage specificity (OTULIN) to enhance its ability to remove the cellular protein ubiquitin associated with innate immunity, resulting in the additive effect of suppressing type I IFN production (40). However, whether nsp11 also regulates IFN signaling remains unclear. In this report, we present evidence that PRRSV nsp11 suppressed type I IFN signaling by targeting IRF9, a key molecule in the JAK/STAT pathway, revealing a potential new function for the nidovirus endoribonuclease in type I IFN signaling.",

            "text": "PRRSV nsp11, a conserved NendoU within the Arteriviridae and Coronaviridae families, belongs to the Xenopus laevis poly(U)-specific endoribonuclease (XendoU) superfamily and plays an important role in nidovirus replication and pathogenesis (41). The structures of the arterivirus nsp11, coronavirus (CoV) nsp15, and XendoU catalytic domains, essential for endoribonuclease activity, and particularly the active site residues (His129, His144, and Lys173; numbering based on PRRSV nsp11), were found to be highly conserved. Besides PRRSV nsp11, several other studies have reported that CoV nsp15 inhibits IFN production in ectopic expression experiments. In support of this, infection with NendoU activity-deficient CoVs, such as PEDV, murine hepatitis virus, and human CoV 229E (HCoV-229E), produced a remarkably high level of type I IFN in primary cells compared with WT infection, which effectively demonstrated the IFN-antagonistic properties of nsp15 of CoVs (27, 42, 43). These data appear to indicate that endoribonuclease activity is sufficient for NendoU-mediated IFN transcriptional repression; however, the NendoU activity of overexpressed nsp11/nsp15 may unexpectedly mediate nonspecific cleavage, thereby inducing cytotoxicity (21, 41). Unfortunately, it was impossible to determine whether the cell cytotoxicity also contributed to the inhibition of IFN induction by NendoU, as mutations disrupting the ability of NendoU to block IFN production abrogated not only endoribonuclease activity but also its cell cytotoxicity (21). Thus, the observation of IFN transcriptional suppression in previous studies could have been the result of cytotoxicity as a consequence of ectopic overexpression of NendoU. Previous studies have shown that PRRSV WT nsp11 is toxic to E. coli and that the expression levels of WT nsp11 are extremely low and that one of the NendoU mutants (nsp11 K173A) can be expressed at high levels under identical conditions (19, 25). Similar phenomena were observed in our experiments designed to express and purify nsp11. Indeed, in our previous study (21), we found that PRRSV WT nsp11 exhibited cytotoxicity to eukaryotic cells whereas no cytotoxicity associated with the NendoU mutants of nsp11 was detected. Similarly, recombinant nsp11 of equine arteritis virus (EAV) has been reported to be extremely toxic to a variety of hosts (25). Thus, the lower level of expression of PRRSV WT nsp11 may have been due to its cytotoxicity (Fig. 4). Interestingly, our results clearly showed that the PRRSV nsp11 mutants (H129A, H144A, and K173A) devoid of both NendoU activity and cell cytotoxicity retained the ability to block type I IFN signaling by targeting IRF9, as did WT nsp11, indicating that nsp11 has evolved a new mechanism for the impairment of IFN signaling that operates in an endoribonuclease activity-independent and cell cytotoxicity-independent manner, distinct from the inhibition of IFN induction.",

            "text": "As a potent antiviral response, type I IFN signaling can control viral infections by activating the transcription factor complex ISGF3 (STAT1/STAT2/IRF9), resulting in increased transcription of hundreds of ISGs and contributing to the development of an antiviral state (12, 13). It is becoming increasingly apparent that IRF9 is a central factor not only for mediation of but also for regulation and direction of type I IFN responses (44). While many IFN effects, in particular, those associated with type I IFNs, require all three canonical signaling molecules, studies of IRF9 deficiency revealed unique roles for IRF9 that were distinct from those of STAT1 and STAT2 (45, 46). Recently, evidence has emerged that IRF9 is the main viral target of the host's innate immune response. For example, our previous study (31) revealed that porcine bocavirus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) inhibits the DNA-binding activity of ISGF3 by interacting with IRF9. Another study showed that the E7 oncoprotein of papillomavirus binds to IRF9 to block the formation of the ISGF3 complex (47). Moreover, many virus-encoded proteins, such as varicella-zoster virus ORF63, adenovirus early region 1A protein (E1A), and rotavirus NSP1, mediate IRF9 degradation (16, 48, 49). Human cytomegalovirus also reduces the protein levels of IRF9 in human embryonic lung fibroblasts (50). To survive in the host, PRRSV has also evolved strategies to block IFN signaling. Previous studies have revealed that PRRSV nsp1\u03b2, a papain-like proteinase, blocks the nuclear translocation of ISGF3 by inducing degradation of karyopherin-\u03b11 (51, 52). Here, we showed that nsp11 is another PRRSV-encoded antagonist of IFN signaling. PRRSV nsp11 adopts a mechanism distinct from that of nsp1\u03b2, i.e., interaction with IRF9, an essential component in the formation of ISGF3. Our data not only highlight the multifaceted control of type I IFN signaling by PRRSV but also uncover a novel mechanism by which PRRSV antagonizes innate immune signaling.",

            "text": "It is well established that IRF9 exhibits several functionally conserved regions among the members of the IRF family, such as an N-terminal DNA-binding domain that recognizes and binds to ISRE motifs in the promoter region of most ISGs and a C-terminal IRF-association domain that is responsible for selective interaction with the coiled-coil domain (CCD) of STAT2 (36, 37). Recently, Rengachari and colleagues reported the crystal structures of IRF9-IAD alone and in a complex with STAT2-CCD (53). The structure of the IRF9-IAD/STAT2-CCD complex revealed that surface features had deviated from their respective paralogs to enable a specific interaction between IRF9-IAD and STAT2-CCD required for ISGF3 function in cells (53). In this study, we found that PRRSV nsp11 specifically interacted with IRF9-IAD. Thus, it may be the case that the targeting of IRF9-IAD by nsp11 sequesters the interaction between IRF9 and STAT2. This may help to explain why the formation and nuclear translocation of ISGF3 were severely impaired in PRRSV nsp11-transfected cells and PRRSV-infected cells. Interestingly, PRRSV nsp11 mutants (H129A, H144A, and K173A) also impaired the formation and nuclear translocation of ISGF3 by interacting with IRF9. Furthermore, the three-dimensional (3D) structures of NendoU activity-defective arterivirus nsp11 (K173A in PRRSV nsp11; H141A and K170A in EAV nsp11) are remarkably similar to those of WT PRRSV nsp11 (21, 23), with an overall root mean square deviation (RMSD) range of 0.408 to 2.000 \u00c5 (data not shown), suggesting that the Ala substitution in His129, His144, and Lys173 of PRRSV nsp11 in this study might not prevent the core conformations of nsp11 protein from folding correctly. On the basis of data presented here and those reported by others mentioned above, we speculate that the ability to interact with IRF9 correlated with the correct folding of nsp11 but not with NendoU activity or cell cytotoxicity. Future investigations will be required to identify the structural basis of the nsp11-IRF9 interaction.",

One of the obstacles to studying arterivirus with NendoU activity-deficient nsp11 mutants in cell culture is that catalytic residue mutations have been reported to nearly completely abolish viral replication even in IFN-deficient cells (19, 26). Future investigations designed to identify other nonactive site residues of nsp11 that are involved in the nsp11-IRF9 interaction but that do not affect PRRSV replication will be required to fully elucidate the function of nsp11 in IFN signaling. In summary, our data identify PRRSV nsp11 as a newly recognized antagonist in IFN signaling and show that the nsp11-IRF9 interaction is involved in inhibition of the formation and nuclear translocation of ISGF3. This novel function of PRRSV nsp11 offers new insight into the interaction between a viral EndoU and the IFN signaling pathway, potentially aiding the development of novel therapeutic targets and more-effective vaccines against PRRSV.",

When the culture optical density at 600 nm (OD600) reached 0.6 to 0.8, the cells were induced by the use of 0.8 mM IPTG (isopropyl-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside) for 7 h at 27\u00b0C. For protein purification, the cultured cells were collected by centrifugation at 4,000 rpm for 10 min and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by disruption with ATS AH-1500. The supernatant was filtered by the use of a filter with a 0.45-mm-pore-size membrane and was then loaded onto a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (GE Healthcare). To gain GST-free proteins, the harvested fusion proteins with an N-terminally GST tag were incubated with GST-3C rhinovirus protease at a ratio of 40:1 for 8 h at 4\u00b0C, and the cleavage products in the cleavage buffer were further separated by reloading onto glutathione-Sepharose 4B column. Finally, the target proteins were eluted by the use of 10 ml cleavage buffer. The purified proteins were stored at \u221280\u00b0C for detection of enzyme activity.",
