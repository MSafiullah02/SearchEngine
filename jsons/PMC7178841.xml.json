During the 1990s asthma prevalence and hospital admissions increased in the United States and worldwide. The increase occurred in both males and females and across all ethnic groups. However, the largest increases occurred in children of low socioeconomic status living in urban settings. Recent asthma statistics should be interpreted with consideration of changes made in the method for reporting asthma prevalence (Fig. 23-1). From 1980 to 1996, the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) conducted by the CDC measured pediatric asthma prevalence as the percentage of children with asthma in the past 12 months. Since 1997, asthma prevalence estimates have been defined as: having received an asthma diagnosis, currently having the disease at the time of the interview, and experiencing an attack in the past year. The more specific definition may have led to a reduction in the number of children reported to have asthma.\n",

A decrease in the number and intensity of exposures in the past century may have placed children at risk of forming less natural immunity to asthma.

This theory can be extended to early infection with respiratory viruses (respiratory syncytial virus is the most extensively studied), which have been linked to the development of asthma. However, this theory is also speculative, as it is unclear whether the exposure to an asthma trigger during a time of rapid lung growth leads to airway remodeling, or whether the respiratory symptoms that occur with these early exposures are simply the initial presentation of a child who is \u201cprone\u201d to the development of asthma.",

Although it is clear that inheritable factors are important to the development of asthma, it is unlikely that a single gene is responsible for this the disease or its response to therapy. A smaller number of genes displaying some effect, either additively or synergistically, is a more plausible explanation. Through case\u2013control studies, family-based association studies, and linkage analysis studies, several candidate genes have been proposed. Two genes that have been investigated extensively are the beta-2-adrenergic receptor gene and the interleukin-4 receptor gene, both of which are located on an area of chromosome 5q. Evidence suggests that polymorphisms of the gene for the \u03b22-adrenergic receptor may affect the clinical response to \u03b2 agonists. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been found at codons 16 and 27. Two substitutions may have particular importance. A change at base 46 from adenine to guanine causes a substitution of glycine for arginine at codon (amino acid position)16 and a change at base 79 from guanine to cytosine causes a substitution of glutamic acid for glutamine at codon 27. Patients with the glycine substitution have been found to be prone to beta receptor down regulation and therefore are clinically less responsive to beta-agonist therapy. Although the detrimental effect of the glycine substitution has been questioned, a meta-analysis revealed a significant association between favorable responses to inhaled beta 2-adrenergic agonists in asthmatic children with the native arginine phenotype at position 16 when compared with children with the glycine substitution. The poor response to beta-agonists was most pronounced in African-American asthmatic children with the glycine substitution. Most recently, a significant pharmacogenomic association was found between a SNP in the glucocorticoid-induced transcript 1 gene (GLCCI1) gene and the response to glucocorticoids in asthma.\nThe phenotype of asthma is likely due to a complex \u00adgene-environment interaction\n",

IL-4 enhances the IgE mediated allergic response, induces the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and promotes differentiation of T helper type 2 lymphocytes leading to further cytokine release. Variants of the gene that encodes for the IL-4 receptor have been shown to be associated with asthma. Recently, nucleotide polymorphisms for the IL4 receptor (IL-4R) have been identified as a genetic risk factor for severe persistent asthma. Further understanding into the role of IL 4R variants may lead to therapies that inhibit the biological actions of IL-4 by either blocking the receptor (via a monoclonal antibody directed at the receptor) or using a soluble recombinant human IL-4 receptor (consisting of the extracellular portion of human IL-4R) to bind and inactivate freely circulating IL-4. Both approaches are areas of active research.",

As the diameter of the pediatric airway is proportionally smaller than that of an adult, the child is more prone to mechanical obstruction from each of the three mechanisms, and therefore, more likely to demonstrate symptoms of respiratory failure.

Bronchospasm, endobronchial edema and mucous plugging each cause a reduction in airway diameter. The relative contribution of each mechanism may vary between asthmatic children and individual exacerbations. Each mechanism of lower airway dysfunction may require distinct therapy. An enhanced inflammatory response contributes to all three mechanisms of lower airway dysfunction and merits further discussion.Decreasing the airway radius by 50% leads to a 16-fold increase in resistance.\n",

Once activated, lymphocytes release a host of inflammatory cytokines (interleukins 4 and 5, among others) that further stimulate the inflammatory response, leading to increased edema. Other inflammatory mediators, such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), regulated on activation, T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), and interleukin-8 have also been found to be important to the ongoing inflammatory response that occurs during status asthmaticus. Eosinophils play a major role in this up-regulated inflammation, leading to release of leukotrienes and the formation of oxygen free radicals, all of which worsen airway edema and mucus production. A study of adults with asthma demonstrated that the number of eosinophils found in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid is directly proportional to the degree of asthma severity, proposing this cell line as the major contributor to asthma severity.\nLymphocytes and eosinophils are important infiltrative cells in asthma pathogenesis.\n",

An inflammatory mediator that is readily measurable is exhaled nitric oxide (NO). L-arginine and L-citrulline are oxidized by NO synthases (NOS), which synthesize NO. There are three isoforms of NOS: inducible NOS (iNOS), which is activated by pro-inflammatory cytokines, and two isoforms of constitutively expressed NO (cNOS), which are expressed on most cells. The fraction of exhaled NO (FeNO) is now moving beyond preliminary research and may become a clinically useful, point-of-care marker of acute as well as chronic asthma. The FeNO has been found to decrease after steroid therapy in asthmatics. It has also been found to be useful in predicting asthma exacerbations in adults.\nThe fraction of exhaled nitric oxide may be a clinically useful marker for inflammation in children with asthma.\n",

            "text": "There are many different external and internal stimuli that can incite acute episodes of status asthmaticus. The most well understood mechanism is IgE-mediated allergic asthma. This immediate type of hypersensitivity occurs when IgE molecules bound to resident mast cells interact with the allergic antigen and lead to the inflammatory response governed by lymphocytes. This stimulus can lead to immediate airway obstruction that is generally short-lived, but can also create a late reaction which can be more severe and persistent. While infections from both viral and bacterial sources can also trigger severe asthma in children, viruses appear to be the major infectious trigger. In the very young child, respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza predominate, while in older children, influenza and rhinovirus become more prevalent. Human metapneumovirus and bocavirus have recently been suggested to be viral etiologic factors for acute bronchospastic disease in children. Environmental air pollution, including second-hand smoke, can result in episodes of severe asthma in those children who are predisposed to bronchial hypersensitivity. Some authors suggest that the rise in asthma seen in the past decades is a result of the environmental changes, especially related to ozone. In children, second-hand smoke from caretakers is known to play a major role in triggering status asthmaticus. Exercise is also a very common trigger of severe asthma, especially in the older child. The worsening of airway obstruction generally occurs after the exercise and not during it, and pre-treatment with pharmacological therapies can have some success in preventing exacerbations of exercise-induced asthma. In all age groups, but particularly noteworthy in infants, gastro-esophageal reflux can produce bronchospasm. The etiology is likely due to direct irritation of the airways by refluxed gastric material, or alternatively, by neurally-induced bronchospasm secondary to irritation of vagal nerve fibers located in the distal esophagus. The control of reflux and gastric acidity remains an important component of asthma treatment. Bronchoconstriction secondary to vagal efferent nerve activity can also be triggered by emotional stress in the older child. This trigger is particularly important when tailoring treatment for a child with asthma. It is possible that an external stimuli such as an allergen commence airway obstruction, but increasing emotional distress can further the severity of the exacerbation. Therefore, the judicious use of low dose sedation may be required in children admitted to the PICU with status asthmaticus who are not mechanically ventilated.\nThere are many external triggers of asthma that require careful assessment by history upon PICU admission.\n",

Certain drugs and mechanical ventilation are well known to trigger bronchospasm when initiated for the treatment of other disease processes requiring critical care. The most common medications that are administered in critically ill children that may trigger asthma are beta\u2013adrenergic antagonists. When used for cardiovascular reasons, these agents have been demonstrated to incite severe bronchospasm, and should therefore, be avoided or used with extreme caution in a child with a known history of asthma. The cardioselective beta-adrenergic antagonists may incite less bronchospasm, but should still be used with caution. Other agents that can trigger airway reactivity are aspirin, other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, and sulfating agents. The influence of a foreign body in the trachea on the development of asthma symptoms is well-known. For example, it is not uncommon to treat a child for bronchospasm after the initiation of mechanical ventilation secondary to a disease process unrelated to the lungs (i.e., neurologic, cardiovascular).

Acute asphyxial asthma (AAA), or rapid-onset near-fatal asthma, is well described in adults. AAA has a predilection for young adult males and is characterized by a brief duration of symptoms (usually less than 6 h), few identifiable triggers and a rapid progression to respiratory failure. Often, the patient will present in extremis, cyanotic, with little to no air movement, and obtundation. Despite the severity of presentation, response to therapy is prompt. When mechanical ventilation is warranted, its duration is usually short, due to rapid improvements in gas exchange. The pathophysiology of AAA may be distinct. An initial neurogenic event that mediates intense bronchospasm may be of primary importance and be independent of the submucosal cellular profile. The challenge remains in identifying asthmatic children who have a propensity for rapid progression and stressing early evaluation and therapy.",

These medications can stimulate both beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic receptors, and the beta-1 effects result in the toxicity seen with these agents. Therefore, a relatively selective beta-2 agonist would be preferable. In the United States, albuterol is the most commonly used selective beta-2 agonist. These medications have their effect by stimulation of the beta-2 receptors on bronchial smooth muscle cells, leading to bronchodilation by the adenosine 3\u2032,5\u2032-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) mediated pathway. When delivered by aerosol, their effectiveness is dictated by distal drug delivery to the bronchial smooth muscle cells. Therefore, their delivery is dependent upon dose, spontaneous tidal volume, gas flow, device used to deliver the gas, and the subject\u2019s breathing patterns. Even under ideal conditions only a small percentage of drug actually reaches the target cells. Therefore, dosing must be titrated accordingly. While the use of serial, fixed-dose, inhaled beta-agonist treatments are appropriate for moderate exacerbation, multiple studies support the use of continuous nebulization in severe cases. This continuous therapy also appears to be well tolerated by the patients, and is less labor intensive for respiratory staff, thereby leading to a degree of cost effectiveness when compared to many intermittent treatments. The adverse effects of the inhaled beta-agonists are mostly related to their beta-1 cardiac effects. Tachycardia is the most common side effect, and is usually well tolerated in children without cardiac disease. Excitability, tremor, and hypokalemia also result from the use of these agents. Albuterol is an equal mixture of the active enantiomer, R-albuterol, and the inactive L-albuterol. Recently, there have been studies investigating levalbuterol, the pure R-isomer for racemic albuterol, in children with asthma. It has been suggested that the use of levalbuterol will have lower cardiac side effects with clinically comparable efficacy. There is also some evidence that this pure R-isomer results in decreased hospitalization rates in children with asthma. As the cost are markedly higher with levalbuterol, and no studies to date have been performed in the PICU setting, clinicians should use their best judgment in selecting a form of racemic albuterol to utilize in severe asthma in the PICU. The use of inhaled beta agonists should continue if the child requires mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Delivery via high dose metered dose inhalers can optimize distal drug delivery while on mechanical ventilation.\nInhaled beta agonists are the mainstay of therapy for the child with severe asthma.\n",

Its use in the therapy of severe asthma is directly related to its physical properties that produce favorable flow characteristics. Normally, gas flow in the lung periphery is laminar because the large cross sectional area of the distal bronchioles allow for slow, streamlined flow. In contrast, upper airway flow is turbulent. Although the diameter of the upper airway is far greater than an individual bronchial, the total cross sectional area available for flow is far less in the upper airway. This results in a high velocity chaotic flow pattern. The pathophysiologic changes that asthma produces in the lower airway (edema, constriction and mucous plugging) result in a reduction in the cross sectional area available for flow. A greater pressure gradient and higher velocities are required to achieve distal flow in the setting of bronchoconstriction, and thus, the flow pattern becomes turbulent. Turbulent flow can be predicted based upon the Reynold\u2019s number (Re) of a gas. Flow is turbulent when the Re  >  2,500. The formula for the Reynold\u2019s number is:\n\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}\n$$ \\text{Re}=VD\\rho /\\mu $$\n\\end{document}\nwhere V is gas velocity, D is the diameter of the airway, \u03c1 is gas density and \u03bc is gas viscosity. Since helium possesses a lower gas density (approximately seven to eight times less dense than air), it results in a lower Reynold\u2019s number, and thus, reduces the likelihood of turbulent gas flow through narrowed airways. The conversion of turbulent to laminar flow allows distal gas delivery with a lesser pressure gradient and reduced velocity. Clinically, this results in improvement in gas exchange and a reduction in the work of breathing. Helium/oxygen mixtures may also inherently improve ventilation as carbon dioxide diffuses at a four times faster rate when compared to an oxygen/nitrogen mixture. These physical characteristics have led to the addition of helium/oxygen mixtures to the armamentarium of asthma treatments. However, further study is needed to determine the impact of helium/oxygen mixtures in children with severe asthma exacerbations. The most beneficial mixture (i.e. the lowest Reynold\u2019s number) will have the highest concentration of helium (80% helium/20% oxygen), but the amount of oxygen required for the patient will dictate the mixture that is tolerated. Whether there is any benefit to mixtures utilizing lower than 70% helium is unknown. In addition, there is increased aerosol deposition in patients with asthma who received a helium/oxygen mixture when compared to air. Using a helium/oxygen mixture to deliver aerosolized medications to patients with severely obstructed small airways may increase the administration of the pharmacologic agents. This, in turn, may lead to a faster resolution of bronchospasm. When this mixture is utilized in a child with asthma who is being mechanically ventilated, the PICU clinician must be cautious in flow and pressure related readings from most conventional ventilators, which are calibrated with only oxygen/nitrogen mixtures, and therefore may display inaccurate readings.",

However, due to the side effects such as tachycardia, dysrhythmias, and specifically cardiac ischemia, intravenous beta-agonists should be utilized only in children without heart disease and be administered in the pediatric ICU. The two most commonly used medications are isoproterenol and terbutaline. Although studies of nebulized therapy with these two medications revealed no difference in either efficacy or adverse events, some authors believe that there are fewer cardiac side effects with terbutaline. However, the choice of which intravenous medication to be instituted must also take into account cost of the medication, and terbutaline is markedly more expensive to utilize when compared to isoproterenol.

There are two mechanisms of action of methylxanthines on bronchial smooth muscle cells. They are potent, but non-selective inhibitors of the phosphodiesterases (PDE), including type 4, which is expressed in many of the cells that are key to the development of asthma. Intracellular cAMP is metabolized to AMP by the PDEs. By inhibiting this enzyme, the intracellular concentration of cAMP increases and displays a negative effect on phospholipase C contraction. This leads to decreased bronchoconstriction. In addition, the PDE inhibiting effect is thought to down-regulate the inflammatory burst from pulmonary inflammatory cells. The second mode of action occurs via inhibition of adenosine-induced bronchoconstriction. Despite these two mechanisms and a long history of efficacy in asthma, these medications are now considered second-line for both chronic asthma therapy as well as during acute exacerbations. One reason for the decrease in use is due to their narrow therapeutic window, in which significant adverse effects (nausea, vomiting, agitation, and tachycardia) can occur with even therapeutic levels. Drug concentrations can also increase or decrease due to multiple interactions with medications that interact with the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes. Methyxanthines have been found to improve clinical asthma scores and airflow during acute exacerbations, but have not consistently been shown to reduce PICU or hospital length of stay.

Mechanical ventilation is complicated in these children by rapid, changes (both improvements and worsening) in airway resistance during the course of ventilation. While the ventilator needs to be tailored to each patient specifically, some general guidelines on initial settings include: volume-cycled ventilation with an initial tidal volume set at approximately 10\u201312 mL/kg, a ventilation rate between 6 and 12 breaths/min, a relatively short inspiratory time (1 s) with an inspiratory to expiratory ratio as long as possible (1:4 or higher depending on the rate), and possibly the application low positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) while monitoring auto-PEEP closely (see below). Newer generations of mechanical ventilators offer newer modes of ventilation, such as pressure-regulated volume control, which may have some benefits over volume-cycled ventilation. The oxygen concentration should initially be set at 100% and weaned as tolerated. The key to deciding on the appropriate respiratory rate and exhalation time is the physical exam. With the patient placed on the initial ventilator settings, the clinician should auscultate breath sounds and visualize chest excursion with each breath. Each positive pressure breath tidal volume should be completely exhaled prior to commencement of the next breath. If not, residual volume from each breath will lead to breath stacking, hyperinflation, and an increased risk of pneumothorax and hemodynamic compromise. If the exhaled flow is not completed, then either the mechanical respiratory rate must be decreased, or the expiratory time must be increased. However, in order to obtain minute ventilation sufficient for carbon dioxide removal, higher tidal volumes and peak inspiratory pressures may need to be tolerated. Normal carbon dioxide levels are not necessary and indeed may lead to preventable barotrauma. Clinicians should allow \u201cpermissive hypercapnia\u201d to limit ventilator-induced lung injury.

Once positive pressure ventilation is instituted, left ventricular afterload may be reduced, but it is offset by a marked reduction in venous return in combination with pre-existing hypovolemia, that may result in a dangerous reduction in cardiac output. This decrease in venous return may be exacerbated by the \u201cauto-PEEP\u201d frequently encountered in severe asthma. It is often necessary to fluid resuscitate the asthmatic child upon intubation, with close attention being required to avoid pulmonary edema. If at all possible, volume loading should be initiated in anticipation of intubation. Positive pressure ventilation, by increasing intrathoracic pressure, decreases left ventricular afterload, and therefore, leads to an improved stroke volume and will increase cardiac output as long as preload is constant. Thus, once an asthmatic patient is volume resuscitated, mechanical ventilation may actually improve hemodynamics. Finally, because the work of breathing in severe asthma can result in a lactic acidosis that may decrease cardiac function, mechanical ventilation may improve inotropy by reducing the work of breathing and decreasing anaerobic metabolism.\nWith close attention to fluid management, mechanical ventilation can improve hemodynamic instability in the child with severe asthma.\n",
