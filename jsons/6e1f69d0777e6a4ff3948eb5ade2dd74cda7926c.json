The number of patients who need extracorporeal membranous oxygenation (ECMO) is expected to increase; however, the clinical characteristics of the patients who require and will benefit from ECMO are unclear. 1 On 15 February 2020, the Japanese Society of Intensive Care Medicine, the Japanese Association for Acute Medicine, the Japanese Society of Respiratory Care Medicine, and the Japanese Society of Percutaneous Cardio Pulmonary Support/ECMO launched \"Japan ECMOnet for COVID-19\" as a telephone consultation, treatment support, and webbased real-time nationwide registry and surveillance system to discuss COVID-19 patients from over 400 hospitals who could be candidates for ECMO. 2 The initiative is led by more than 20 ECMO experts (Japan ECMOnet for COVID-19) from all over Japan.",

The median number of days between intubation and ECMO was 3 days (range, 0-9 days).

Selected laboratory data of the patients on admission were: median serum KL-6 (a marker of interstitial pneumonia) was 333 U/mL, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was 460 IU/L, and procalcitonin was 0.12 ng/ mL. With regard to ECMO settings, the median blood flow was 4 L/min (range, 2.5-5.3 L/min), the median size of the draining cannula was 24 Fr (range, 21-25 Fr), and the median size of the infusing cannula was 20 Fr (range, 16-21 Fr). For antiviral treatment, lopinavir was used for 13/14 (93%) patients. All patients received empirical antibiotics (carbapenems or third/fourth generation cephalosporins).",
