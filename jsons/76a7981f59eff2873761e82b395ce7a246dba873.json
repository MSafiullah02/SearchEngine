Anaerobic digestion can only reduce the sludge volume by 50% in mass, leaving the other half as a growing waste management and hygienic problem. Hydrothermal processing (HTP), a set of several chemical digestion processes, could be used to convert sewage sludge into valuable products and minimize potential environmental pollution risks. Specifically, hydrothermal carbonization and hydrothermal liquefaction have been extensively studied to sustainably manage sludge. Two of the main reasons for this are the high upscalability of HTP for public waste management and that it is estimated that HTP can recover eleven times more energy from waste products than landfilling. An integration of HTP with anaerobic digestion or recycling the soluble organics (in the HTP aqueous products) into the HTP process could lead to a higher overall rate of energy recovery for municipal sewage sludge.",

Ionic and free-radical reactions are believed to be the major reactions in HTL. The kinetics of these reaction pathways have been studied to investigate the relationship between temperature and pressure on reaction yield, with temperature showing a large effect on the output of the process [13]. Subcritical water exhibits limited interaction with sewage sludge owing to low diffusivity and, therefore, acts mainly as a reaction medium [13] . In contrast, supercritical water exhibits higher diffusivity and increases the rate of interaction between the solvent and sewage sludge. This conclusion is based on growing evidence that the rate constants of HTL reactions are heavily dependent on pressure in the critical pressure point, wherein water reaches supercritical conditions (i.e. the near-critical region of water) [20, 21] . The conversion efficiency is highly enhanced when water reaches the supercritical point [12] .",

In fact, the density of water can be changed by adjusting temperature and pressure in the subcritical and supercritical states. In the nearcritical water region, hydrogen bonding in water is weaker, and thus, water can serve as a hydrogen donor for sewage sludge conversion. In the supercritical region, however, free-radical reactions are dominant because the possibility of generation of radicals from a series of elemental reaction steps increases at high temperatures [13, 20, 21] . In short, the effect of pressure is different on subcritical and supercritical water. For subcritical water, temperature is the dominant factor affecting the reaction efficiency, whereas for supercritical water, both temperature and pressure play a key role in promoting the conversion efficiency.",

First, denitrogenation process yields typically increase with temperature and reaction time in HTL. These conditions likely increase the opportunity for dissolution and hydrolysis of proteins and thus release more nitrogen. Second, nitrogen yield also varies markedly with changes in pH in the reaction medium, indicating that denitrogenation occurs readily under acidic or basic conditions during HTL [29] . Finally, more nitrogen can be removed by increasing the basicity of alkaline metals used to separate nitrogen from the mixture through ionic reaction pathways. Identification of these factors leads to a theory that denitrogenation happens via an ionic reaction path catalyzed by OH \u00c0 ions in aqueous alkaline solutions [29] .",

The feedstock biochemical composition played an important role in dictating the oil yield. A comparison of different feedstocks shows that the highest oil yield was reached using a high-lipid feedstock. The higher heating value of the biocrude oil produced via continuous HTL typically ranged from 33.2 to 39.3 MJ/kg for most of the feedstocks, but not the sewage sludge (which led to a higher heating value of 26.8 MJ/kg) [41] . Table 2 show that most of the continuous HTL reactors used, were operated in the plug flow reactor mode. The reactor size varied from the laboratory (0.05 L) to pilot scale (35 L). The largest flow rate available in the literature was 90 L/h from the University of Sydney [10]. A continuous-flow pilot plant reactor was operated at temperatures of 300e350 C. The process was a fast HTL process (residence time = 3e 5 min), so the reactor size was not big (estimated to be 4.5e7.5 L). In comparison, the largest flow rate (1) Continuous feeding/pumping mechanism: The continuous feeding mechanism is identified as one possible peripheral bottleneck because of two reasons. First, phase separation may occur in sewage sludge. This would be a serious issue especially in the winter, given that sewage sludge may contain high amounts of water. (Water would freeze in the winter, and thus, an external heating source is needed for the feeding tank.) Second, the viscosity of the sewage sludge could be very high and thus slow down its flow rate. Preferably, 20e25 wt.% of solid content is favored to achieve a net positive energy gain [7, 44] . However, increasing the solid content may decrease the flowability of sewage sludge. The viscosity of the sewage sludge slurry dictates if the pumping system can be stably operated with a constant feedstock flow rate to the reactor. Possible solutions include the development of efficient pumping methods and pretreatments to reduce the viscosity of sewage sludge [40, 45] .",

In particular, the sewage sludge feedstock may contain highly volatile content (e.g. food waste), semivolatile content (e.g. paper or plastic), and nonvolatile content (e.g. metals and minerals) [22] . Because of a huge difference of their volatility (which indicates their convertibility under HTL), possible clogging may occur. How to mitigate or prevent the clogging when running a continuous pilot-scale HTL reactor is especially important because even a small clogging would build up the pressure and lead to safety problems. To resolve this issue, a recent study from Aarhus University (Denmark) has used a hydraulic oscillator to enhance the mixing of sewage sludge by increasing the turbulence in the reactor system [42] . 5) Product collection system: The products from HTL may be flowable at relatively high temperatures (e.g. >100 C) but not at ambient conditions (i.e. 20e25 C). Without a proper collection system, the HTL products may also lead to clogging of fullscale continuous-flow reactors. Furthermore, how to safely reduce the pressure from the reactor system to the product collection end is another issue. Last but not least, optimization of the heat exchanger represents an important aspect of the product collection system and a significant factor in the overall energy efficiency of a continuous HTL system [40] . 6) Technology suitable for abating strong odors:",

Conventional incineration systems generally consume more energy than they produce because of the high moisture content in sewage sludge. Alternatively, anaerobic digestion (AD), an oxygen-free microbial fermentation of organics for biomethane generation, could be considered to cope with the increasing quantity of sewage sludge. AD is generally more effective than incineration for energy recovery. AD is also the most common method for sewage sludge stabilization, resulting in the reduction of volatile solids. However, AD usually suffers from poor conversion efficiencies (<50%), slow reaction rates (several weeks), and high capital costs. Moreover, a large volume (>50%) of the wet residual digestate (or AD sludge) would be generated after AD [57]. HTP is an emerging technology for AD sludge conversions with considerably faster reaction times (minutes) and high conversion efficiencies (>50%). Herein, we have provided an estimated energy process input, energy output/input for processes, and the greenhouse gas emissions of different sewage sludge treatment methods (Figure 1b ; more details are included in Table S1 in Supplementary Data). As Figure 1b shows, HTP can recover at least four-fold the amount of energy put into in a laboratory-scale reactor, primarily because HTL can directly treat wet feedstock without drying (but not other methods). Compared with similar technologies for AD sludge management (e.g. landfilling), HTP not only sterilizes the sludge but also converts it into valuable end products, with 11-fold higher energy recovery and emissions in greenhouse gas decreased by 78e85% [2] . Multiple published studies also suggest that an integration of AD and HTP could benefit a resilient watereenergy nexus [2,5].",

Further research should be conducted with continuous-flow reactors using different types of sewage sludge and cosolvents. Particularly, increasing the sewage sludge concentration to around 20e25% without losing the flowability of the slurry for continuous HTL is critical in terms of process development to the industrial scale [40] . A higher solid content of sewage sludge (with a maximum content of 35% from a batch-scale study) typically can lead to a higher biocrude oil yield. As a result, the energy balance of continuous HTL systems would be improved because energy lost to a volume of water would decrease with a reduction in water content, and therefore, the production costs can be reduced [9] . One possible method to increase the sewage sludge concentration is pretreatment of sewage sludge. For instance, several pretreatment methods using acid hydrolysis, alkaline treatment, liquid hot water, ammonia, and steam explosion were applied to the slurries for enabling their pumpability for continuous HTL systems [40, 45, 60] . It was also found that an alkaline environment was preferable for preparing pumpable woody biomass for continuous HTL reactions [45, 60] .

HTP, including HTC and HTL, is a promising method to sustainably manage sewage sludge because it can convert sewage sludge into useful products while mitigating the environmental risks of sewage sludge simultaneously. HTC has been extensively used for phosphorus recovery, while HTL can effectively remove CECs. Energy analysis of HTP indicated that HTP has a 11-fold higher energy recovery than landfilling. Further research on techno-economic analysis, environmental impact, and commercialization potential of HTP technology is recommended.",

This study discusses how optimized operating conditions could be effectively used for the co-conversion of waste activated sludge and birchwood sawdust to bio-oil by HTL with an improved yield and quality (indicted by the reduce molecular weight of the bio-oil). The operating conditions considered in this research include reaction temperature, reaction time and solids concentration for the maximum bio-oil production. A synergetic effect of wastewater sludge and lignocellulosic biomass in HTL was also demonstrated. ",

Chemosphere 2019, 228:619-628. This work provides a detailed review on phosphorus transformation mechanism and new insights into the selective transfer of phosphorus in HTP of biosolids. An enhanced phosphorus recovery via HTC was also demonstrated. The phosphorus recovery rate can be achieved up to 98.37% at a pH of 7.52 with the struvite purity of 90.41%. This study shows efficient ways of utilizing HTP to reclaim phosphorus, which is a non-renewable resource and an essential element for all living organisms. 12.

This is a recently-published comprehensive study that demonstrates a large scale biofuel production from wastewater sludge (i.e., biosolids) is attainable in the U.S. This work exhibits an estimation of site-specific annual sludge production in total and by treatment phase for publicly owned treatment works in the U.S. The average wastewater solids concentrations and removal rates, and site-specific daily average influent flow rate were utilized in this study. Current beneficial uses, feedstock aggregation potential and regional production hotspots in the U.S. were also assessed. Using municipal wastewater as a sustainable bioresource, this study outlines an overview of wastewater sludge management system in the U.S. ",
