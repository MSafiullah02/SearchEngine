In March 2020 the World Health Organization declared the SARS-Cov-2 virus a global pandemic. We performed a narrative review to describe existing literature with regard to Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, management and future perspective. MEDLINE, EMBASE and Scopus databases were searched for relevant articles. Although only when the pandemic ends it will be possible to assess the full health, social and economic impact of this global disaster, this review represents a picture of the current state of the art. In particular, we focus on public health impact, pathophysiology and clinical manifestations, diagnosis, case management, emergency response and preparedness. a natural and zoonotic origin: two scenarios that can plausibly explain the origin of SARS-CoV2 are: (i) natural selection in an animal host before zoonotic transfer; and (ii) natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer [5, 6] . Clinical features and risk factors are highly variable, making the clinical severity range from asymptomatic to fatal [7] . Understanding of COVID-19 is on-going. This review aims to summarize early findings on the epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, management, and prevention of COVID-19.",

            "text": "To address the pathogenetic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2, its viral structure and genome must be considered. Coronaviruses are enveloped positive strand RNA viruses with the largest known RNA genomes-30-32 kb-with a 5 -cap structure and 3 -poly-A tail. Starting from the viral RNA, the synthesis of polyprotein 1a/1ab (pp1a/pp1ab) in the host is realized [14] . The transcription works through the replication-transcription complex (RCT) organized in double-membrane vesicles and via the synthesis of subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) sequences. Of note, transcription termination occurs at transcription regulatory sequences, located between the so-called open reading frames (ORFs) that work as templates for the production of subgenomic mRNAs [15] . In the atypical CoV genome, at least six ORFs can be present. Among these, a frameshift between ORF1a and ORF1b guides the production of both pp1a and pp1ab polypeptides that are processed by virally encoded chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) or main protease (Mpro), as well as one or two papain-like proteases for producing 16 non-structural proteins (nsps) [15] . Apart from ORF1a and ORF1b, other ORFs encode for structural proteins, including spike, membrane, envelope, and nucleocapsid proteins and accessory proteic chains [14, 15] . Different CoVs present special structural and accessory proteins translated by dedicated sgRNAs. Pathophysiology and virulence mechanisms of CoVs, and therefore also of SARS-CoV-2 have links to the function of the nsps and structural proteins. For instance, research has underlined that nsps are able to block the host innate immune response [16] . Among the functions of the structural proteins, the envelope has a crucial role in virus pathogenicity as it promotes viral assembly and release.",

The data so far available seem to indicate that the viral infection is capable of producing an excessive immune reaction in the host. In some cases, a reaction takes place, which as a whole is labelled a \"cytokine storm\". The effect is extensive tissue damage. The protagonist of this storm is interleukin 6 (IL-6). IL-6 is produced by activated leukocytes and acts on a large number of cells and tissues [17] . It is able to promote the differentiation of B lymphocytes, promotes the growth of some categories of cells, and inhibits the growth of others. It also stimulates the production of acute phase proteins and plays an important role in thermoregulation, in bone maintenance and in the functionality of the central nervous system [18] . Although the main role played by IL-6 is pro-inflammatory, it can also have anti-inflammatory effects. In turn, IL-6 increases during inflammatory diseases, infections, autoimmune disorders, cardiovascular diseases and some types of cancer [19] . It is also implicated into the pathogenesis of the cytokine release syndrome (CRS) that is an acute systemic inflammatory syndrome characterized by fever and multiple organ dysfunction [20] .",

            "text": "The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 varies from asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic forms to clinical conditions characterized by severe respiratory failure that necessitates mechanical ventilation and support in an intensive care unit (ICU), to multiorgan and systemic manifestations in terms of sepsis, septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction syndromes (MODS) [21] . Asymptomatic infections have also been described, but their frequency is unknown. The main symptoms are reported in Table 1 . Pneumonia appears to be the most frequent serious manifestation of infection, characterized primarily by fever, cough, dyspnea, and bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging. [22] There are no specific clinical features that can yet reliably distinguish COVID-19 from other viral respiratory infections. Other, less common symptoms have included headaches, sore throat, and rhinorrhea. In addition to respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea and diarrhea) have also been reported, and in some patients they may be the presenting complaint. Respiratory droplet transmission is the main route and it can also be transmitted through person-to-person contacts by asymptomatic carriers [21, 22] . Chest CT in patients with COVID-19 most commonly demonstrates ground-glass opacification with or without consolidative abnormalities, consistent with viral pneumonia [23] . Chest CT abnormalities are more likely to be bilateral, have a peripheral distribution, and involve the lower lobes. Less common findings include pleural thickening, pleural effusion, and lymphadenopathy [24] . Chest CT may be helpful in making the diagnosis, but no finding can completely rule in or rule out the possibility of COVID-19. The possibility of COVID-19 should be considered primarily in patients with new onset fever and/or respiratory tract symptoms (e.g., cough, dyspnea) [23] [24] [25] . It should also be considered in patients with severe lower respiratory tract illness without any clear cause. Although these syndromes can occur with other viral respiratory illnesses, the likelihood of COVID-19 is increased if the patient [26] : (1) resides in or has travelled within the prior 14 days to a location where there is community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (i.e., large numbers of cases that cannot be linked to specific transmission chains); (2) has had close contact with a confirmed or suspected case of COVID-19 in the prior 14 days, including through work in health care settings. Close contact includes being within approximately six feet (about two meters) of a patient for a prolonged period of time while not wearing personal protective equipment or having direct contact with infectious secretions while not wearing personal protective equipment.",

A lower respiratory tract aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage should be collected from patients who are intubated. Data from this study suggested that viral RNA levels are higher and more frequently detected in nasal compared with oral specimens, although only eight nasal swabs were tested. SARS-CoV-2 RNA is detected by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [33] . A positive test for SARS-CoV-2 generally confirms the diagnosis of COVID-19, although false-positive tests are possible. If initial testing is negative but the suspicion for COVID-19 remains, the WHO recommends resampling and testing from multiple respiratory tract sites [34] . The accuracy and predictive values of SARS-CoV-2 testing have not been systematically evaluated. Negative RT-PCR tests on oropharyngeal swabs despite CT findings suggestive of viral pneumonia have been reported in some patients who ultimately tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.

Glucocorticoids should not be used in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia unless there are other indications (e.g., exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) [40, 41] . Glucocorticoids have been associated with an increased risk for mortality in patients with influenza and delayed viral clearance in patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. Although they were widely used in management of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), there was no good evidence for benefit, and there was persuasive evidence of adverse short-and long-term harm [42, 43] . A number of investigational agents are being explored for antiviral treatment of COVID-19, and enrolment in clinical trials should be discussed with patients or their proxies. Certain investigational agents have been described in observational studies or are being used anecdotally based on in vitro or extrapolated evidence. It is important to emphasize that there are no controlled data supporting the use of any of these agents, and their efficacy for COVID-19 is unknown.",

However, there was no difference in time to clinical improvement or mortality at 28 days in a randomized trial of 199 patients with severe COVID-19 given lopinavir-ritonavir (400/100 mg) twice daily for 14 days in addition to standard care versus those who received standard of care alone [53] . Moreover, limited evidence are available for baraticinib, a numb-associated kinase (NAK) inhibitor, with a particularly high affinity for the kinase AAK1, a pivotal regulator of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, anakinra, an anti IL-1, used in some UTI settings in Lombardy, Italy, and faviparavir a RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase inhibitor. Support oxygen therapy with high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) should be used only in selected patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure. Compared with standard oxygen therapy, HFNO reduces the need for intubation. Patients with hypercapnia, hemodynamic instability, multiorgan failure, or abnormal mental status should generally not receive HFNO, although emerging data suggest that HFNO may be safe in patients with mild-moderate and non-worsening hypercapnia. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) patients treated with either HFNO or NIV should be closely monitored for clinical deterioration.

In particular, regarding the use of face mask, health care workers are recommended to use particulate respirators such as those certified N95 or Filtering FacePiece 2 (FFP2) when performing aerosol-generating procedures and to use medical masks while providing any care to suspected or confirmed cases [63] .

If high income countries, especially those already affected by the outbreak, seem to face a catastrophic perspective, in low-income countries there seem to be two possible scenarios. In particular, in the worst-case scenario, when the COVID-19 outbreaks, the majority of countries will be unprepared, with low resources allocated for affording the viral emergency and the consequences will be catastrophic. In the best case scenario, similarly to the global outbreak of the SARS-CoV in 2003, also the COVID-19 will not affect Africa or South America on a large scale suggesting that respiratory viruses spread more effectively in the winter and, therefore, the southern hemisphere will be affected later in the year, if at all [63] . To this could contribute also the climate-specific cultural differences (living more outdoors than indoors), the effect of UV light on the survival of the virus on surfaces, immunological differences of the population (innate immunity), preexposure with coronaviruses, or the higher temperatures [64] . This data was also indirectly supported by Chin and colleagues that artificially reproduced different environmental conditions in order to study the virus survival capacity [65] . In addition to this hopeful low impact, if the prevention measures will be implemented, we could register a lower incidence of hygiene-linked diseases that still represent leading causes of death [66] .",

There is a rapidly growing body of literature on this topic and hopefully it will help in finding an effective vaccine and the best practice for the management and treatment of symptomatic cases. Only once this pandemic ends, one will be able to assess the health, social and economic impact of this global disaster and we should be able to learn lessons especially in terms of public and global health for any future similar pandemics.",
