            "text": "Human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) is not a textbook example of a respiratory viral infection. Nonetheless, hCMV infection has a respiratory phase that usually is not diagnosed because of its mild and unspecific symptoms in the immunocompetent host. So, it is subsumed under the popular term \u201ccommon cold\u201d that is used for symptoms of respiratory virus infections for which there is no medical indication to identify the cause and for which symptomatic treatment is sufficient, for instance infections with rhinoviruses, common coronaviruses, and parainfluenza viruses. Historically, CMVs were named \u201csalivary gland viruses\u201d ([1, 2], reviewed in [3, 4]), as they replicate in acinar glandular epithelial cells of the salivary glands, from where they are released into the salivary duct [5, 6]. A frequent route of host-to-host transmission for primary infection is thus through saliva of a virus-shedding contact person, for instance in mother-to-child transmission. Transmission probability is increased whenever very young children crowd together, such as in multi-child families and in daycare centers. As an example of real life epidemiology for lectures on medicine, toy sharing, that is the mouthing of toys that other children have mouthed, has been identified as a way by which hCMV is transmitted between peers (reviewed in [7], see also the contribution by Adler and Reddehase in this issue of MMIM [8]).",

Clearly, allergic airway disease (AAD) elicited by inhaled environmental antigens is not the rule. The development of AAD requires a \u201csensitization phase\u201d, which, in immunological terminology, means \u201cpriming\u201d of allergen-specific T cells, usually type-2 CD4+ T helper (Th-2) cells, as well as re-exposure to the allergen for a recall response. In their effector phase, restimulated allergen-specific Th-2 cells secrete cytokines that induce goblet cell (GC) metaplasia, such as the interleukins IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-25 [12\u201314]. Remodeling of the airway mucosa by transdifferentiation of ciliated cells and Clara/Club cells to mucus-producing GC, rather than by proliferation of GC [15], associated with thickening of airway epithelia and chronic mucus hypersecretion and consequent airflow obstruction, is the lead histopathological manifestation of AAD.",

Combined sensitization by OVA and mCMV, however, followed by challenge exposures to OVA, caused AAD that is characterized by a massive increase in the number of mucus-producing GC. This histopathology is referred to in the literature as GC hyperplasia or metaplasia, depending on whether one focuses on the increase in GC numbers [12] or on the remodeling of the mucosa by transdifferentiation of ciliated cells and Clara/Club cells to GC [15], respectively. It should be noted that AAD was not induced when either OVA sensitization or OVA re-exposure were missing. These controls verified the OVA-specificity of AAD. Depletion of CD4+ T cells shortly before the first OVA challenge prevented AAD, whereas depletion of CD8+ T cells did not. So, the effector cells in AAD are OVA-specific CD4+ T cells.",

Upon co-exposure of airway mucosa to inhaled antigen/low potency allergen, represented by OVA in the specific case, and mCMV, the virus activates MHC-II+CD11c+ dendritic cells (DC) that localize to the mucosa, specifically DC of the CD11b+ subset of conventional B220lowLy6clow DC, briefly CD11b+ cDC. Their activation is indicated by upregulation of CD28 ligands CD80 and CD86, and is associated with enhanced uptake of OVA. The OVA-laden CD11b+ cDC then migrate selectively to the airway draining lymph nodes, where they present processed OVA peptides by MHC-II molecules to na\u00efve OVA peptide-specific Th-2 cells for priming. Upon re-exposure to inhaled OVA, restimulated OVA peptide-specific Th-2 cells secrete effector cytokines IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-25, all known to be involved in the induction of GC metaplasia.",

Classical allergens and most pathogens have the intrinsic property to activate DC, whereas inhaled environmental protein antigens do not, and are thus ignored by the sentinels. This is a \u201chealthy ignorance\u201d, as otherwise all environmental antigens would cause allergy. Activation of DC by CMVs is beneficial for priming a protective antiviral immune response, though it can result in allergic disease when used by otherwise harmless \u201cstowaways\u201d for entering DC. The findings suggests that by this \u201cdoor opener\u201d function, CMV airway infection may broaden the spectrum of potential allergens. Current experimental protocols did not lead to full-blown asthma. Future work will address the question if repetitive allergen exposure will eventually lead to clinical asthma.",
