There are two serotypes of FCoV that differ in cell culture characteristics. Serotype I predominates in North America and Europe, whereas Serotype II is more closely related to canine coronavirus (CCV) and predominates in Japan.\u2022Coronaviruses are found in many animals and are generally adapted for infecting epithelial cells of the respiratory or gastrointestinal tract. FCoV is closely related to CCV, swine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine respiratory virus, and some human coronaviruses. The CCV that causes enteritis and diarrhea in dogs (see Chapter 14) can infect cats and cause antibodies that crossreact with FCoV. Experimentally, CCV can cause enteritis, diarrhea, and even FIP in cats.\n",

The majority of these seropositive cats represent current or past inapparent infection with non-mutated FCoV. Only some of these develop into mutated FIP-causing infections; thus, the prevalence of FIP is much lower.\u2022The prevalence of FCoV infection is highest in cats confined in crowded groups, such as catteries, shelters, and multiple cat households, where the seroprevalence ranges from 50% to 90%.\u2022In endemic catteries where the seroprevalence approaches 90%, most FCoV-infected cats remain healthy and only 5% develop FIP.\u2022The seroprevalence of FCoV in free-roaming feral and stray cats is 12% to 15%. The lower prevalence is presumed to relate to less social interaction and less exposure to fecally excreted virus than cattery cats.\u2022The seroprevalence in single-cat households is 15% or less.\u2022In a large survey of North American veterinary teaching hospitals, FIP was diagnosed in 1 of every 200 new feline accessions.

Any contaminated material can end up on the fur and thus be ingested by the cats. Consider the following control measures to reduce the environmental virus load and to minimize exposure:\u2022Use at least one litter box for every two cats. Locate litter boxes away from food and water bowls to avoid cross-contamination. Ensure that the area is easy to clean and disinfect.\u2022Scoop feces from litter boxes daily, and replace litter and disinfect litter boxes as often as possible (at least weekly).\u2022Dispose of used litter in sealed plastic bags.\u2022Use dedicated food and water bowls for each animal, and clean and disinfect bowls regularly.\u2022Brush the fur of cats regularly to remove contaminated fecal particles and litter that could be ingested during grooming.\u2022Reduce cross-contamination between cats by housing cats individually or in stable small groups of four or less.\u2022Avoid having too many kittens because they shed the greatest amount of virus.\u2022Ideally, identify and eliminate persistent carriers that continuously shed large amounts of virus by using fecal RT-PCR tests repeated over several months.\n",
