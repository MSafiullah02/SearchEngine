Second, gathering people together to be trained in person increases the risk of exposing staff to infection.1 Third, the rapid growth in numbers of cases of infection and disruptions in the global supply chain of PPE presents a real risk of shortages of this equipment.2 Therefore, alternative training methods should be considered.",

The effect of different video training schedules and strategies on performance in donning and doffing PPE would be worthy of further study.",
