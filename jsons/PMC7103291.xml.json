In the California decision of Tarasoff v Board of Regents, the court held that psychotherapists have a duty to act to protect third parties when the therapist knows or should know that the patient poses a threat of serious harm to the third party [7]. In reaching this conclusion, the court relied on a balancing analysis of patients' rights to privacy and the public interest, \u201cThe Court recognizes the public interest in supporting effective treatment of mental illness and in protecting the rights of patients to privacy. But this interest must be weighed against the public interest in safety from violent assault\u201d [7].",

Many states have passed statutes that address the duty to protect third parties, and others have either limited the scope of or eliminated the duty [10], [11]. State statutes generally limit the circumstances in which a duty to protect arises. For example, state law may require a specific threat to an identifiable third party, a known history of violence on the part of the patient, and/or a reasonable reason to anticipate violence. In addition, state laws may also delineate the measures that may be taken to discharge the duty to warn, such as notifying police or other law enforcement agencies, hospitalizing a patient, or warning the potential victim. One state that employs this approach is Massachusetts [12].",

In these jurisdictions, the psychiatric consultant may have a legal obligation to warn a third party beyond that of the physician requesting the consultation. In some situations, the psychiatrist's duty to warn might even run counter to competing legal requirements for the primary treatment team [12], [13], [14]. For example, Massachusetts requires physicians, in general, to keep HIV-related information confidential, but also imposes a duty to protect on psychiatrists. In the case of an HIV-positive individual who is putting an unknowing sexual partner at risk, medical and surgical physicians are bound by the HIV confidentiality statute, whereas psychiatrists have competing obligations under the HIV and Tarasoff-inspired statutes.",

In fact, one of the historic precedents that the Tarasoff court used in its reasoning was the existence of mandated reporting of certain communicable diseases, which predated wider duties to protect third parties [7]. States and the federal government, for example, have laws regarding which communicable diseases must be reported to state authorities and/or the Centers for Disease Control. Common examples include varicella, hepatitis, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and HIV, but the list of reportable infectious diseases is generally lengthy so physicians should be aware of the requirements in the jurisdictions in which they practice [15], [16], [17]. Especially regarding HIV, jurisdictions vary regarding what information must be reported, whether reporting is anonymous, whether written permission is required to release information, and whether spousal notification is required [14], [16], [17]. In addition, doctors have been held civilly liable in cases both predating and since Tarasoff for failure to disclose a patient's infectious disease status that led to the infection of other individuals [18], [19], [20], [21].",

Confidentiality is a cornerstone of the doctor\u2013patient relationship and, as such, breaches for any reason should be carefully considered. Clinicians should always limit the amount of information disclosed to the minimum necessary to achieve the purpose of the disclosure and attempt to make clinical interventions, such as hospitalization of the patient or otherwise engaging the patient in a safe plan, before resorting to releasing information to any third party [24].",

The second element, factual understanding, may be assessed by asking if the patient has attained knowledge of the nature of the illness, the treatment options, the prognosis with and without treatment, and the risks and benefits of treatment. In determining whether a patient has a factual understanding or is capable of developing one, it is critical to ascertain what efforts have been made by the treating physicians and other staff to educate the patient about the proposed treatment.

Last, the patient must demonstrate that his or her decision-making process is a rational one. This element takes into account the patient's past preferences and life decisions, and focuses not on the rationality of the final decision but on the process by which the patient arrived at the final decision. For example, in the case of a Jehovah's Witness who would certainly live with a blood transfusion but certainly die without it, the decision to reject the blood transfusion might, on its face, seem irrational.

Informed consent must be knowing (or intelligent) and voluntary [42], [45], [46], [47], [48]. The standard for what information is required for consent to be knowing or intelligent varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. There are two general approaches to determining how much information a physician must present to a patient for consent given by that patient to meet the knowing criteria [40]. The first, known as the \u201creasonable professional standard,\u201d is clinician-focused. The second, known as the \u201creasonable patient standard,\u201d is patient-focused. The reasonable professional standard is followed by a small majority of states. This approach requires clinicians to provide the amount of information to the patient that a reasonable professional would provide under the same or similar circumstances. On the other hand, the reasonable patient standard employed by a substantial minority of states requires clinicians to provide the amount of information that would be used by a reasonable or average patient in making an informed decision. Some states employing the patient-centered approach go further, requiring an inquiry into what information the particular patient would find material or relevant in making thi sparticular decision [49]. Finally, two states use a mixed approach in determining the amount of information required [50].",

Finally, there are limits to the amount of information physicians are responsible for sharing in the course of informed consent. For example, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has acknowledged the need for a balance between patients' right to know, fairness to doctors, and a more general societal interest that the law not place \u201cunrealistic and unnecessary burdens\u201d on clinicians [51].",

For example, in general, individuals pressured by their family members to make a certain decision or to agree to a medical treatment are generally found to have acted voluntarily both from ethical and legal perspectives, although exceptions do exist [55], [56]. On the other hand, although there is debate on the issue, individuals who are totally dependent on others for their care, such as residents of long-term care facilities and prisoners, are often categorically deemed unable to give voluntary consent to treatment and research because of the inherent unequal balance of power between the patient and the institutional administration or authorities [57], [58], [59], [60].",

Therapeutic privilege does not apply, however, in a situation where providing information to the patient might make the patient less likely to accept treatment.

For example, in situations where the treatment is of low risk, consent is often obtained from family at the bedside. This practice may also be employed for other treatment decisions, depending on the jurisdiction [14], [40]. However, as proposed treatments become increasingly intrusive, aggressive, or risky, the need for a formally designated substitute decision maker increases. State statutes and case law may determine whether a formal mechanism such as guardianship or court approval is required for a particular intervention. Depending on the jurisdiction and the proposed intervention, such formal mechanisms may be required even when the treating physician believes the intervention is routine. One example is the use of antipsychotic medications in Massachusetts [68].",

First, it must be established that a doctor\u2013patient relationship existed, which imposed a duty of reasonable care on the physician with regard to the patient. Second, it must be shown that the physician breached that duty. Third, it must be shown that the breach, or dereliction, of the duty directly caused the patient's harm. Fourth, it must be shown that the patient suffered damage as a result of the physician's actions or inactions [1], [39], [52], [69].

Treating clinicians have the primary duty of care for the patient. On the other hand, consultants do not have the same duty to the patient [62]. The duty of the consultant is to the consultee, or the requesting physician. In other words, the consultant must provide consultation with reasonable care. However, once consultants cross the boundary between advising the consultee and actually providing treatment to the patient, the consultant owes the patient the same standard of care as the treating physician. For example, if the consultant recommends that the consultee prescribe a medication to the patient, the duty is to the consultee. However, if the consultant enters the order and actually prescribes the medication to the patient, the consultant will be held to the level of care of a treating physician. It is thus important for the consultant to be aware of his or her role in the treatment of the patient, and to maintain clear division of tasks with the consultee regarding all psychiatric interventions in the care of the patient. Additionally, if the consultant does assume a treating role, then he or she should be cognizant of the need to monitor and follow-up on the patient as if he or she is the primary treating psychiatrist.",
