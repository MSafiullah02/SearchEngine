The viral genome is single-stranded, positive-sensed RNA and consisted of the 5\u2032 untranslated regions (5\u2032 UTR), one open reading frame (ORF), 3\u2032 UTR and the 3\u2032 end poly(A) sequence. In infected cells, the polyprotein is translated from the ORF and then processed to 4 structural proteins (VP1, VP2, VP3, VP4) and 7 nonstructural proteins (2Apro, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, 3Cpro, 3Dpol) via viral proteinases, 2A and 3CD.",

Among them, 16 sequences of EV-G1 and one isolate of EV-G2 show an insertion of a papain-like cysteine protease (PLCP) gene from porcine torovirus at the 2C-3A junction sites (Tsuchiaka et al., 2017) (Fig. 1\n). We call them type 1 recombinant EV-G in this study. Our previous data demonstrated high prevalence of type 1 recombinant EV-G in the EV-G population (Tsuchiaka et al., 2018). Our previous data demonstrate high prevalence of type 1 recombinant EV-G in the EV-G population (Tsuchiaka et al., 2018). Type 1 recombinant EV-Gs have been discovered from feces of neonatal pigs showing clinical symptoms, such as diarrhea, in the US, Belgium, Germany and South Korea (Bunke et al., 2018; Concei\u00e7\u00e3o-Lee and Lee, 2019; Neto et al., 2017; Knutson et al., 2017; Shang et al., 2017), while type 1 recombinant EV-Gs identified in Japan are detected from normal as well as diarrhea pig feces (Tsuchiaka et al., 2018). In addition to type 1 recombinant EV-G, second type of recombinant EV-G (we call type 2 recombinant EV-G in this study), which carried the PLCP gene in place of viral structural genes, has been identified in a Chinese pig farm (Wang et al., 2018). The PLCP gene is encoded in the ORF1 of the genome of torovirus, a member of family Coronaviridae, and the order Nidovirales (Concei\u00e7\u00e3o-Neto et al., 2017; Knutson et al., 2017; Shang et al., 2017; Tsuchiaka et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2018). The PLCP of nidoviruses serves as a protease to cleave viral gene 1 polyproteins to mature proteins (Mielech et al., 2014). It also has functions of deubiquitinating and deISGylating (interferon-stimulated gene15-removing) enzymes, which plays important roles in viral pathogenesis by acting as an innate immunity antagonist (Shang et al., 2017).",

Subsequent metagenomics analysis of the RNAs of the non-diarrheal pig feces obtained from a pig farm in Tottori prefecture, Japan, led to discovery of a novel type 2 recombinant EV-G genome (EVG/Porcine/JPN/MoI2-1-2/2015: GenBank with accession number LC316774).

Overlapping PCR products were successfully obtained and direct sequencing analysis of the gel-purified PCR products showed that the nucleotide sequences of the PCR products were the same as those obtained in metagenomics analysis (Fig. 2\n). By the results of conventional RT-PCR (data not shown) and SYBR-green real-time RT-PCR using primers in Table 1\n(average Ct-value 25.0066 for type 1, 26.5738 for type 2), we also found that the fecal sample contained similar amounts of the type 1 and type 2 recombinant viruses, which implying that type 2 recombinant EV-G was not a minor population compared with type 1 recombinant EV-G in the sample. These results strongly suggested that virus particles carrying type 2 recombinant genome indeed existed in the fecal sample and our data were not an artifact of metagenomics analysis.",

The new type 2 recombinant EV-G genome carried a single ORF, suggesting that translation of the viral polyprotein starts at the translational start codon (ATG) at the 5\u2032 end of the unique region 1 and ends at the stop codon (TAA) of 3D gene. In contrast to the reported type 2 recombinant EV-G genome in China, which carries the PLCP gene of pig torovirus in place of viral structural genes (Wang et al., 2018), the newly identified type 2 recombinant EV-G carried the PLCP gene from pig torovirus plus ~0.3 kb-long upstream and ~0.9 kb-long downstream flanking sequences (Fig. 3A). In addition, the newly identified type 2 recombinant EV-G lacked 11 amino acids at the N-terminal of 2A protein. We noted that the same 11 amino acids are also deleted in type 2 recombinant EV-G detected in the pig farm in China (Wang et al., 2018). In contrast, the N-terminal truncation of the 2A proteinase gene did not occur in type 1 recombinant and non-recombinant EV-Gs, implying that the truncated 2A may be a specific characteristic feature among type 2 recombinant EV-Gs. Furthermore, type 2 recombinant EV-Gs lacked GxCG motif in 2A, which is considered to form part of the active site of the protease and is conserved among enteroviruses (Gorbalenya et al., 1989). In contrast all type 1 recombinant EV-Gs carry this motif in 2A (data not shown). An internal region (amino acids 180\u2013240) of the 304 amino acid-long unique region 2 of the newly identified type 2 recombinant EV-G showed high amino acid homology with genes of baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis repeat (BIR) superfamily by a multiple sequence alignment using Clustal W (Thompson et al., 1994) in MEGA 7 (Kumar et al., 2016) (Fig. 3B). In contrast, unique region 1 and other regions in unique region 2 showed no significant amino acid homologies with any known proteins.",

Phylogenetic trees were generated by the maximum-likehood method (T92 + G model or GTR + G + I model) and analyzed with 1000 replicates for bootstrap using MEGA 7. Phylogenetic analysis showed that 2A, 2B, 2C, 3C, 3D genes of the newly identified type 2 EV-G made different clusters from known non-recombination EV-Gs and type 1 recombinant EV-Gs (Fig. 4A to E), including type 1 recombinant EV-G, which co-existed with the new type 2 recombinant type 2 in the same feces; type 1 (shown in blue) and type 2 (shown in red) were found in the same feces collected in this study. Interestingly, PLCP of type 1 and type 2 recombinant EV-Gs belong to same cluster (Fig. 4F). These data suggest that the type 2 recombinant EV-G was not directly derived from known type 1 recombinant EV-Gs nor non-recombinant EV-Gs, and the origin of PLCP of each type was same torovirus. We also noted that the new type 2 recombinant EV-G had the 247 nt-long 3\u2032 UTR (Fig. 1), which was substantially longer than 40 to 165 nt-long 3\u2032 UTR of most of picornaviruses, supporting the notion that the new type 2 recombinant EV-G has evolved independently from type 1 recombinant EV-Gs or non-recombinant EV-Gs.",

Because the type 1 recombinant EV-G was detected in the same feces sample as the new type 2 recombinant EV-G, this type 1 recombinant EV-G, which belongs to different subtype, might have served as the helper virus. Otherwise, in this study, we might detect genome of type 2 recombinant EV-G in the dead host cells, not in the viral particles.

            "text": "One unanswered question in this study was whether the protein region translated from the non-picornaviral genes of the newly identified type 2 recombinant EV-G undergoes protein processing. Coronavirus PLCP cleaves the viral gene 1 polyproteins through recognition of a LXGG motif, while PLCP of arterivirus, another nidovirus, recognizes sequence LIGG, TTGG or PSGG (Mielech et al., 2014). However, cleavage specificity of torovirus PLCP has not need identified. Accordingly, it is unclear whether the PLCP in the newly identified type 2 recombinant EV-G cleaves any regions in the protein region translated from the inserted foreign genes. Enterovirus 2A and 3CD cleave Y/G pair and Q/G pair, respectively (Earle et al., 1988), while these pairs were absent at junctions at unique region 1/PLCP, PLCP/unique region 2 and unique region2/truncated 2A as well as within the putative polyprotein translated from the non-picornavirus sequences. Moreover, the absence of GxCG motif conserved in chymotrypsin-like protease in 2A of type 2 recombinant EV-Gs suggests that the 2A proteinase function of the type 2 recombinant EV-G 2A was most probably defective. As enterovirus 2A induces cleavage in host proteins, absence of biologically active 2A potentially affect host environment, including translational status, and possibly affect viral gene expression. Taken together, it is unlikely that the protein region translated from the inserted foreign genes undergo processing by the truncated 2A and 3CD. If the torovirus PLCP does not induce a cleavage(s) into the polyprotein of the newly identified type 2 recombinant EV-G, a protein consisted of unique region 1, PLPC, unique region 2 and N-terminal truncated 2A, might have been accumulated in cells infected with the newly identified type 2 recombinant EV-G. If so, testing the deISGylation function and anti-apoptotic function of this putative protein would provide a clue as to a possible reason(s) for retention of these nonpicornavirus sequences in the type 2 recombinant EV-G. Alternatively, the putative polyprotein with the torovirus PLCP and the BIR domain may have another biological function that is important for replication of the newly identified type 2 recombinant EV-G.",
