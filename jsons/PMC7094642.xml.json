It is now found in Africa, Asia, Central- and South-America, with the very real potential for spread into North America.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 By December 2013 the first local transmission of Chikungunya virus was reported in the Western Hemisphere; likely first with autochthonous cases in St. Martin.9, 10 As of 08/08/14 over 500,000 suspected/laboratory confirmed cases have been reported in the Americas. Local transmission has been reported extensively throughout the Americas, including the United States and US territories in the Caribbean. As the vector is highly adaptable to a variety of geographic regions, further spread is to be expected, especially as the CDC cautions there is a risk the virus will be imported to new areas by infected travelers.8\n",

That notwithstanding, the actual timeline of CHIKV may go back into the 18th century. Typically infection resulted from enzootic and local outbreaks in Africa, and Asia, but the epidemiology has changed as a result of demographic shifts, overcrowding, travel, and the ability of vectors to adapt.14, 15 Large-scale epidemics affecting millions in Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Pacific regions have occurred, such that more than 45 countries, including ones in the Americas are at risk from CHIKF. Not surprisingly the risk of CHIKV can both influence and be influenced by tourism and travel.16\n",

Improvement in pain reduction or improvement in quality of life was greatest in the NSAID plus glucocorticoid group. They report no greater benefit resulted from the addition of HCQ.3, 11, 43 Corticosteroids should be limited to short-term therapy referable to potential toxicity. Available reports do not suggest corticosteroid-induced exacerbation of CHIKV infection when glucocorticoid therapy is utilized during the chronic phase of infection.",

In terms of their use in arbovirus arthropathy, limited information exists documenting the safe and effective use of biologic therapies for CHIK arthritis. Among 147 chronic arthritis patients treated during an outbreak on Martinique, most patients were treated with MTX (up to 25 mg/week) with good results; 12 patients received anti-TNF therapy. The mechanism of action associated with Methotrexate includes inhibiting cell proliferation by inhibiting purines and pyrimidines; it acts as an anti-folate agent.3, 11, 43 Although the precise mechanism of methotrexate associated anti-inflammatory action remains yet to be fully elucidated, it may be the result of induction release of adenosine. Adenosine is associated with the suppression of neutrophil, macrophages/monocytes, dendritic cell and lymphocyte inflammatory function.3, 11, 47, 48 The anti-inflammatory effect of MTX on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is thought to involve the inhibition of the following proinflammatory cytokines: IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1. Methotrexate is also thought to affect neutrophil chemotaxis, the proliferation of synovial fibroblasts and lymphocytes, and increases the production of IL-4 and IL-10, and other cytokines.11, 47 Over the years much clinical experience and benefit of MTX as a treatment of RA and related inflammatory arthropathies has been realized. Moreover ready availability and relative cost effectiveness make MTX attractive as a potential treatment for persistent CHIKV arthritis. Overall it is well tolerated.11 During a Dominican Republic epidemic, 53 of 328 rheumatoid arthritis patients developed CHIKF while on biologic therapy. Their illness was similar to other patients treated for CHIKF during this outbreak. Of note, the use of biologic therapy did not appear to protect against or exacerbate their CHIK infection.3\n",
