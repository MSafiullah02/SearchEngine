Two months into the COVID-19 outbreak, however, a retrospective study in China involving more than 200 participants revealed a neurological component to in a subset of patients. The observed symptoms, the cause of which remains unclear, included impaired consciousness, skeletal muscle injury and acute cerebrovascular disease, and appeared more frequently in severe disease. Since then, findings from several studies have hinted at various possible neurological outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Here, we review the historical association between neurological complications and highly pathological coronaviruses including SARS, MERS and COVID-19. We draw from evidence derived from past coronavirus outbreaks, noting the similarities and differences between SARS and MERS and the current COVID-19 pandemic. We end by briefly discussing possible mechanisms by which the coronavirus impacts on the human nervous system, as well as neurology-specific considerations that arise from the repercussions of COVID-19.",

Disease severity can range from an illness with only mild respiratory symptoms to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Incubation time is also variable, with symptoms taking from two days to as long as around two weeks to appear [7] . COVID-19 presents most frequently as a pneumonia, with its associated signs and symptoms, including fever, dry cough, and breathlessness, with characteristic radiological changes of bilateral lung opacities [6] . Whilst many of these also feature in SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has a propensity to cause lower respiratory tract infections, as suggested by the relatively less frequent occurrence of symptoms such as rhinorrhoea and sore throat. SARS and MERS are also more commonly linked to gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhoea. Furthermore, it has become increasingly clear that all of these highly pathogenic coronaviruses affect the cardiovascular system, with evidence of both acute and chronic cardiovascular features [8] .",

These included impaired consciousness, acute cerebrovascular disease and skeletal muscle symptoms, suggesting the involvement of both the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS). The observed symptoms were more likely to be present in patients suffering from severe disease. Other possible PNS symptoms included hypogeusia and hyposmia. The link between these neurological symptoms and patient outcome could not be investigated, as patients were still acutely hospitalised at the time of the publication. Another study by the same group reported that in 13 patients COVID-19 infection was followed by acute cerebrovascular disease, including ischaemic stroke, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and cerebral haemorrhage [10] .

In one study involving 206 SARS patients, five cases of acute cerebrovascular disease were reported [24] . Whether this merits a parallel being drawn between SARS and COVID-19 pathophysiology is, however, debatable. Noting that these are rare presentations, and acknowledging that they are, in some cases, associated with a differential diagnosis, the presence of viral RNA, in both cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) [19, 21] as well as in autopsied brain tissue [23] , nevertheless points to a neurotropic component to the SARS coronavirus.",

One suggested mechanism is through haematogenous dissemination, whereby the virus crosses into the CNS from the bloodstream by infecting endothelial cells or leukocytes [35] . Another possible pathway is via retrograde neuronal routes, in which the virus gains access to the CNS by infecting peripheral neurons [35] . Animal studies have demonstrated that SARS-CoV could reach the brain via an olfactory route, promoting neurodegeneration [33] . Emerging evidence from two studies, both available via bioRxiv preprint, and therefore yet to be peer-reviewed, suggests that SARS-CoV-2 also gains access to the CNS via the olfactory pathway, with concordant results demonstrating the expression of both the ACE2 receptor and the spike protein protease TMPRSS2, which is also required for SARS-CoV-2 entry, by specific subsets of cells present in the olfactory region [36, 37] . Whilst reports of SARS-related olfactory neuropathy are sparse [38] , anosmia and hyposmia are increasingly being recognised as key features of COVID-19 infection, often as a presenting symptom [9, [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] .",
