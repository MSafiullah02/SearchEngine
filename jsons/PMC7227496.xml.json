An increased risk of VTE has recently been suggested in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with COVID-19 infection despite adequate thromboprophylaxis [5,6]. A Chinese center reported a case series of three patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and thrombosis associated with antiphospholipid antibodies represented by anticardiolipin (aCL) and anti\u2013\u03b22-glycoprotein I (a\u03b22GPI). No lupus anticoagulant was detected in any of these patients [7]. A French group published a brief letter studying 56 patients of which 25 patients (45%) were positive for lupus anticoagulant (LAC), while aCL or a\u03b22GPI were detected in only 5 out of 50 tested patients (10%, 3 associated to LAC) using IgG and IgM detection. However, the investigators did not report thrombotic complications in these patients [8]. These findings could suggest a role of antiphospholipid antibodies or lupus anticoagulant in the pathogenesis of thrombosis (either arterial or venous) in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. The aim of our study was to evaluate the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and confirmed VTE.",

Of these, 367 were discharged at the time of analysis; the incidence of VTE in these population was 6.5% (95% IC 4.2\u20139.6%). All but five patients received standard doses of thromboprophylaxis prior to VTE diagnosis. Mean age of the sample was 64.3 (SD 14.4) and 58.3% were male. The clinical and laboratory characteristics of the sample at the diagnosis of VTE are summarized in Table 1\n. None of them had known thrombophilia, recent long travel or pregnancy. Six patients (25%) were diagnosed with VTE on admission. For the rest of patients, median days from admission to VTE diagnosis were 14 (IQR 9.5\u201318). Eleven (45.8%) patients presented PE alone, nine (37.5%) patients presented DVT alone and four (16.6%) patients presented PE and DVT. Among patients with PE (n = 15), 6 (40%) patients had intermediate-high risk PE and 9 (60%) patients had low risk PE, respectively. Location of the thrombosis is included in Table 1. No episodes of arterial thrombosis were observed. Two patients (8.3%) were weakly positive for anticardiolipin IgM (19.3 U/mL and 15.8 U/mL, respectively [normal range: 0\u20137 U/mL]) and anti\u2013\u03b22-glycoprotein I IgM (14.1 U/mL and 16.2 U/mL, respectively [normal range: 0\u20138 U/mL]).

However, scarce data has been published about the incidence of VTE in these patients. A multicenter study of 184 patients with severe COVID-19 reported a VTE cumulative incidence of 27% (95% CI 17\u201337%) despite adequate thromboprophylaxis [4]. A single-center study from Italy found a cumulative incidence of 21% for thromboembolic events (both arterial and venous), with the majority of patients receiving thromboprophylaxis [9]. Another single-center study from France also reported an incidence of PE of 20.6% [10]. These results suggested that VTE could remain underdiagnosed in patients with severe COVID-19.",

Among them, 72.2% had severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and 66.6% had >4 points according SOFA, denoting the markedly high severity of the sample. However, at the time of the study period no patient had died and 62.5% had been discharged. Despite the severity of the cl\u00ednical presentation, thrombocytopenia was not frequent. On the other hand, markedly high D-dimer levels were found in the majority of the sample. The two previously mentioned publications [7,8] had suggested a role of antiphospholipid antibodies or lupus anticoagulant in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and thrombotic complications. The first article was a case series of 3 patients from a Chinese center. In this publication, titration of antibodies was not reported and 2/3 patients had a high cardiovascular risk and previous history of thrombosis [7]. The second article was a brief letter studying 56 patients from two French centers. Among them, aCL or a\u03b22GPI were detected in only 5 out of 50 tested patients (10%, 3 of them associated to lupus anticoagulant) using IgG and IgM detection. Again, the investigators did not report the titres of the antibodies and their sample did not comprise patients with thrombotic events [8]. Antiphospholipid antibodies abnormally target phospholipid proteins, and the presence of these antibodies is central to the diagnosis of the antiphospholipid syndrome. However, these antibodies can also arise transiently in patients with critical illness and various infections [7]. Our study only found 2 (8.3%) patients with anticardiolipin IgM and anti\u2013\u03b22-glycoprotein I IgM weakly positive, suggesting that the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies is not frequent among patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who suffer venous thromboembolism.",
