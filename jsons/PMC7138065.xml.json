Targeted active case-finding is a fundamental strategy for disease control that has been used to stop epidemics ranging from smallpox to severe acute respiratory syndrome to Ebola virus disease, and has been recognised as a crucial component of the epidemic-control response to tuberculosis since the 1930s.6, 7, 8\n",

The second step is to ensure that individuals with tuberculosis are rapidly diagnosed and put on an effective treatment regimen. Delays in diagnosis and treatment contribute to persisting transmission of tuberculosis.12, 13 Diagnostic and treatment policies in high tuberculosis-burden countries have largely relied on conventional sputum smear microscopy as the main diagnostic technique and on a standard empirical treatment regimen of four first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs.14 However, sputum smear microscopy has severe limitations: it fails to detect about half of all tuberculosis cases;15 its sensitivity in children sick with tuberculosis is about 10%;15 its sensitivity in people living with HIV who are sick with tuberculosis is less than 30%;16, 17 it cannot diagnose patients with extrapulmonary tuberculosis, who represented 15% of notified cases in 2013;1 and it cannot detect drug resistance. Furthermore, although cases that are detectable by sputum smear microscopy are generally more infectious than those that are not, the non-detectable cases have been shown to cause 13\u201317% of transmission in low-incidence settings.18, 19 Reliance on smear microscopy rather than more sensitive procedures for diagnosis thus allows infectious cases to remain undetected in the community for longer. In addition, policies that rely on both sputum smear microscopy and empirical treatment with a standard first-line anti-tuberculosis regimen can result in long periods of ineffective treatment for patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis.",

A seminal prospective, randomised, controlled study32 done at the Tuberculosis Chemotherapy Center, Madras (now Chennai), India, in the 1950s reported that household members of patients with tuberculosis who were treated at home had no greater risk of tuberculosis disease or infection after 5 years than household members of patients who were treated in sanatoria and thus restricted from contact with their families. Furthermore, since the 1950s, independent studies have measured the infectiousness of patients with tuberculosis who were being treated in hospital using an experimental model in which highly susceptible guineapigs were exposed to the air from a ward of patients with tuberculosis, and then tested for tuberculosis infection. These experiments repeatedly showed a rapid reduction in the patients' infectiousness after initiation of effective therapy, even while they might remain sputum smear positive.33, 34, 35 In the earliest experiments, patients began treatment on the day of admission to the hospital; guineapigs exposed to patients who started effective treatment for drug-susceptible tuberculosis were only 2% as likely to be infected as guineapigs exposed to untreated patients, suggesting that the patients were rendered non-infectious almost immediately after initiation of multidrug therapy.33 In later studies using a similar experimental set-up, rapid attenuation of infectiousness was reported for patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis who were treated effectively with regimens that contained sufficient drugs to which the infecting strains were susceptible.34 By contrast, these guineapig exposure studies have repeatedly reported most infections to be associated with patients who have undiagnosed or ineffectively treated drug-resistant tuberculosis, underscoring the importance of rapid initiation of the correct regimen and the danger of protracted infectiousness in these patients.33, 34, 35, 36 Epidemiologically, the continuing transmission of drug-resistant strains that results from diagnostic failure or an absence of effective treatment is suggested by the prevalence of drug resistance in patients who have never been treated for tuberculosis; across the WHO European Region in 2013, 14% of patients without previous treatment had multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.1\n",

Although the effect of these activities at a population level is difficult to measure over a short timeframe, evidence suggests that they have a role in reducing tuberculosis incidence. In a community-randomised trial in Brazil, eight communities matched according to socioeconomic indicators were assigned to either an intervention or control condition. In the intervention communities, outreach workers actively sought out household contacts of tuberculosis cases for prompt screening, and treatment was given for both tuberculosis disease and infection.37 The control communities received the local standard of care, which relied on contacts to present to health facilities for assessment, and did not routinely provide preventive therapy. At baseline, the two sets of communities had nearly identical annual tuberculosis case notification rates (340 cases per 100 000 individuals in communities receiving the intervention and 339 per 100 000 in the controls). After 5 years, the intervention communities had a statistically significant 15% lower annual tuberculosis case notification rate than the control communities (p=0\u00b704). A community-randomised trial in Zambia and South Africa allocated 24 communities to four intervention conditions involving different combinations of case-finding interventions such that each group was similar with respect to baseline prevalence of tuberculosis and HIV infection, and demographic characteristics.38 After 3 years, communities in which household contacts of patients with tuberculosis were systematically assessed had an 18% lower prevalence of tuberculosis in adults (p=0\u00b7095) and a 55% lower rate of tuberculosis infection in children (p=0\u00b7063) than communities in which household contacts were not assessed.",

Contact investigation refers to the process of systematically identifying and screening contacts of patients with tuberculosis.39 Since the risk of transmission increases with the intensity and duration of contact, contact investigation in the household and other places where patients with tuberculosis live (eg, workers' dormitories, prisons) is a logical case-finding strategy to consider in all countries. Common components of contact investigations include patient interviews in the clinic, asking patients to bring household members and other close contacts (particularly children) to the clinic for assessment, and home visits by a health-care worker to identify and screen household members. Although programmes generally prioritise the most infectious cases for contact investigation, investigations of children, who generally have non-infectious forms of tuberculosis, can lead to detection of infectious adult cases; this is sometimes called a source case investigation since transmission is assumed to have occurred from the adult to the child. At a children's hospital in Texas, USA, 17\u201324% of children diagnosed with tuberculosis were accompanied to the hospital by an adult with previously undiagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis.40, 41\n",

This strategy is important in both low-burden settings and high-burden settings. Analysis of routinely collected programme data can help identify high-risk groups in a particular location. Furthermore, in some high-burden settings, analysis of programme data can identify geographical hotspots where community-level interventions such as door-to-door screening and deployment of mobile diagnostic units could be a high-yield activity (see Theron and colleagues,46 paper 1 in this Series). In countries where genotyping is practised, such as China, the combination of genotype and geographical data might allow even more specific identification of transmission hotspots.PanelExamples of targeted active case-finding policies in risk groups that contribute disproportionately to local tuberculosis burdenAcross the WHO African Region in 2013, the prevalence of HIV in adults aged 15\u201349 years was 4\u00b75%,42 but an estimated 34% of tuberculosis cases were associated with HIV.1 Screening people with HIV for tuberculosis is therefore a crucial strategy for tuberculosis case detection.In Russia, about 0\u00b75% of the population is incarcerated. However, prisoners accounted for 27% of tuberculosis cases in 1995.43 Since then, Russia has focused on addressing tuberculosis in prisons, enforcing both mandatory screening and directly observed treatment.43 These policies have been credited with reducing the proportion of tuberculosis cases that were detected in prisons to 12% in 2004.In the USA, tuberculosis incidence among homeless people is roughly 10 times the incidence in the general population.44 National guidelines recommend that staff in homeless shelters monitor clients for persistent cough and ensure prompt assessment either at the shelter or by providing transportation to a health-care facility.45\n",

Strategies for targeted active case-finding typically use screening algorithms that progressively reduce the number of individuals at each step of assessment to ensure that time-intensive and resource-intensive procedures such as sputum culture and full clinical assessment by a physician are done for individuals who are likely to have tuberculosis. A common first step is to ask individuals about symptoms and risk factors, and move only those who are symptomatic or high risk to the next step of assessment. However, the choice of symptoms included in the initial interview can greatly affect the performance of the symptom screen, with trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity. In a prevalence survey in western Kenya,49 where the prevalence of bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis was 0\u00b76%, the presence of cough for 2 weeks or longer had 52% sensitivity and 89% specificity in predicting tuberculosis, whereas the presence of any tuberculosis symptom (cough, haemoptysis, weight loss, fever, or night sweats) had 90% sensitivity and 32% specificity. Furthermore, for children, additional symptoms such as reduced playfulness and failure to reach an age-appropriate weight are important components of a symptom screen. Finally, the comparatively high sensitivity (94%) and specificity (73%) of an abnormal chest radiograph for predicting tuberculosis in the western Kenya survey49 (with similar results reported from other prevalence surveys) strongly supports inclusion of chest radiography into screening algorithms.",

Active case-finding activities require staff and diagnostic resources in addition to those already in place to support passive case-finding. Additionally, if active case-finding activities are successful, the number of patients requiring treatment will increase in the short term, even though subsequent reduction in transmission should reduce the number of cases in the long term. Therefore, anticipation of increased diagnostic and treatment capacity should be part of the planning process for any active case-finding activity. Furthermore, monitoring and assessment should be planned to ensure that the people screened by an active case-finding initiative are those at the highest risk rather than those who are easiest to reach, and that increases in diagnoses represent true case detection and not overdiagnosis. Finally, while active case-finding activities have as their main goal the prompt diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis disease, they can also provide a platform for the diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis infection and exposure to prevent development of future cases (see Rangaka and colleagues,50 paper 3 in this Series). Therefore, the coordination of case-finding and prevention efforts should be considered.",

One strategy to identify cases and prevent nosocomial transmission is to screen individuals in waiting areas for tuberculosis symptoms and quickly separate symptomatic individuals from the general population. This type of rapid triage was instrumental in halting nosocomial transmission during the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Asia.7\n",

Therefore, use of new molecular diagnostic tests to rapidly diagnose drug resistance and presumptive treatment for drug-resistant tuberculosis are both integral to stopping transmission of drug-resistant strains. Molecular diagnostic tests can detect drug resistance in hours or days rather than the weeks needed for conventional culture-based drug susceptibility testing. In settings with high prevalence of drug resistance, such as Russia, Peru, and various southern African settings, universal drug susceptibility testing using molecular tests has been shown to be feasible, reducing the time to diagnosis of drug resistance and initiation of second-line treatment.51, 61, 62 In settings with low rates of drug resistance in the general tuberculosis patient population, rapid molecular testing of people suspected of having tuberculosis or patients meeting certain criteria for being at an increased risk of drug resistance (eg, contacts of an individual with drug-resistant tuberculosis, individuals with a history of tuberculosis treatment, patients not responding to treatment, and refugees) has proven to be a feasible intermediate step toward universal drug susceptibility testing.",

Thus, not only is the method of diagnosis important to consider, but also the timeliness and ease with which patients receive diagnostic results and are linked to care. High rates of failure to initiate treatment after diagnosis have been reported in a range of settings.64 Sometimes, gaps in the health-care delivery system can lead to a failure to communicate test results or an absence of action based on these results.65, 66 In KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, only 20% of patients with rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis had started tuberculosis treatment within 2 weeks of testing using the Xpert MTB/RIF assay, which yields results within hours.67 In other situations, patients themselves might decline treatment despite receiving a diagnosis of tuberculosis, particularly if they have no or mild symptoms or if treatment interferes with their ability to work. Nearly a quarter of patients diagnosed with sputum smear-positive tuberculosis during a community survey in India did not initiate treatment, with the two most common reasons being lack of interest in treatment and having symptoms too mild to warrant treatment.68 Therefore, strategies are needed to ensure that all individuals diagnosed with tuberculosis are informed of their diagnoses, counselled appropriately, and promptly treated. Strategies could include the collection of accurate contact information during the initial diagnostic encounter, optimisation of diagnostic procedures and communication systems to reduce time to diagnosis and treatment, active follow-up of people who do not initiate treatment, incentives for initiation of treatment, and oversight and support for individuals requiring it during treatment. In some countries, regulations exist that allow a tuberculosis programme to compel a patient to accept treatment despite his or her refusal; the decision about how to balance the rights of a patient with the public health system's mandate to protect the public is complex and warrants careful consideration.69\n",

Additionally, partnerships with other government sectors, such as those in charge of prisons or social welfare programmes, can ease access to vulnerable or hard-to-reach populations. Finally, partnerships with the private sector are necessary in settings such as south Asia, where 80% of patients seek care from private providers.75 In view of the large number and the heterogeneity of private providers, it is an immense undertaking for national tuberculosis programmes to effectively engage these providers to ensure that patients with tuberculosis receive timely diagnoses and appropriate treatment, and that all tuberculosis cases are reported to the national tuberculosis programme even if they are diagnosed and treated in the private sector. Although strategies will vary across settings, some approaches that have proven successful include use of large private hospitals with associated clinic networks as reporting centres for the national tuberculosis programme; use of mobile phone-based platforms to help report screening or diagnostic results from private facilities; and mass media campaigns that give publicity to private facilities that have partnered with the national programme to offer testing and treatment.29, 75\n",

Models consistent with the present tuberculosis epidemics in China, India, and South Africa predict that an increase in case detection by 25% can achieve a 40\u201344% reduction in tuberculosis-associated mortality, a 22\u201327% reduction in incidence, and a 30\u201333% reduction in prevalence in 10 years (figure\n).76 Furthermore, these interventions were deemed to be highly cost effective, even if the costs of the interventions were as high as US$2500 per case detected in India, and $5000 per case detected in China and South Africa. Importantly, these projections show that the population-level benefits of active case-finding accumulate with time since removal of infectious cases from the population prevents the development of additional cases in both the near-term and long-term future; thus an assessment at the end of 1 year is unlikely to show a substantial effect, even though the 10 year projected benefit is substantial. These projections assume that detection is synonymous with prompt and effective treatment, so all case-finding has to be directly linked to the immediate delivery of care.",

Some administrative and environmental interventions, such as providing individuals suspected of having tuberculosis with surgical masks until treatment begins and, where practical, opening windows in health facilities, can be implemented immediately without changes to existing systems or large investment of resources. Others, such as performing basic household contact investigations, implementation of the FAST strategy, and expansion of the use of molecular diagnostics, will require some additional human resources, training, and capacity building, but can be rapidly accomplished within the context of existing health-care delivery systems. Still others, such as integration of health-care services, have a slightly longer timeframe because they require the development of partnerships and the reorganisation of existing systems. The development and deployment of new point-of-care diagnostic technologies could accelerate these efforts by making diagnosis easier in the future.",
