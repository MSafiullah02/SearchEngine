It can be argued that OH practice is key to all stages of a disaster, i.e. prevention, preparation, response and recovery as demonstrated by their role in assessing hazards and risks in workplaces and work practices as well as employees' fitness for work. As a result, OH professionals are encouraged to engage with the implementation of these international processes pertaining to disaster risk reduction and management at local, national, regional and global levels. This will help ensure the effectiveness of implementing the disaster risk reduction framework and that OH issues are appropriately addressed. For example, the impact of the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak on work and workers was a stark reminder for health systems, international businesses and organizations of the devastating impact on workers, workplaces, communities and economies of an emerging infectious disease that knows no international borders [6] . Workers in different sectors were affected to varying degrees [6] : it is considered that the highest burden of EVD infection was seen in health workers, especially in West Africa, particularly in Sierra Leone, because of significant exposures to the EVD infection both in community settings and during patient care [7] . Workers in other sectors of the economy such as extractive industries (i.e. ore mining), transport, retail and hospitality sectors were also affected [8] . Border closures, disrupted transportation, restrictions on travel, quarantines in areas where risk of infection was high and lack of investor confidence resulted in unemployment as well as businesses and companies suspending operations and halting trade [8] .",

The term BBB is relevant to employers and OH professionals, especially that national, regional and local initiatives in preparation of and the aftermath of disasters are encouraged to include strategies to foster employment, support livelihood protection and recovery, improve skill development, ensure social protection, prevent poor working conditions and ensure business continuity. These are important given the evidence that the wider social determinants of work such as insecure, poor quality employment and poor working conditions are associated with an increased risk of physical and/or mental health illness that in turn result in absence due to illness and ultimately loss of work. OH professionals have an important role in delivering these three 2015 UN landmark agreements, given their roles within healthcare and the wider industrial domains for influencing and engaging actively in emergency preparedness, prevention, managing disaster risks, post disaster planning and recovery. Their roles can be seen as operationalizing a strategic vision which was articulated by the International Labour Organisation Director General on 12 March 2015: 'The goal of decent work provides a solid basis on which governments can establish and reinforce the engagement of social partners, businesses and agents of local economic development in disaster risk reduction. Through better regulation, innovative partnerships, specific incentives and mechanisms of cooperation with local communities, this can be done. As actors and beneficiaries, employers, workers and their organizations have a dual role in disaster risk reduction and workplaces are focal points for prevention, mitigation, recovery and rehabilitation strategies' [11] .
