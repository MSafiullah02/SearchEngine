The microbiota also plays an important role in the development of the mammalian immune system and maintenance of intestinal health by enhancing the intestinal epithelial barrier (Van den Abbeele et al. 2011; Kamada et al. 2013). New sequencing technologies have advanced our understanding of the complexity, diversity and richness of the equine intestinal and faecal microbiota (Shepherd et al. 2012; Dougal et al. 2013; Schoster et al. 2013; Costa et al. 2015a).",

            "text": "The intestinal microbiota of horses has recently been described and is dominated by a few main phyla, particularly Firmicutes. This phylum includes the vast Clostridia class that contains, in addition to a small number of pathogens, various genera associated with gut health (e.g. Lachnospiraceae, Rumincoccaceae and Faecalibacterium). Whilst there is likely a core of genera or species conserved among most or all horses, there are marked differences in composition, even at the class level among intestinal compartments and increasing diversity towards the distal gut (Costa et al. 2015a). Even among horses subjected to similar diet and husbandry practices, the intestinal microbiota shows a high degree of individual variation (Dougal et al. 2013; Schoster et al. 2013). Studies in horses have demonstrated alterations in the faecal microbiota, some even at the phylum level, in disease states including colitis (Costa et al. 2012), post partum colic (Weese et al. 2015), chronic laminitis (Steelman et al. 2012) and following antimicrobial administration in healthy horses (Harlow et al. 2013; Costa et al. 2015b). For example, in horses with undifferentiated colitis, Bacteroidetes was the most abundant phylum compared with Firmicutes in healthy control horses (Costa et al. 2012); meanwhile, orally\u2010administered trimethoprim sulfadiazine (TMS) in healthy horses resulted in a drastic decrease in the members of the Verrucomicrobia phylum (Costa et al. 2015b). Whilst data implicating alterations of the microbiota as causes of disease are currently much stronger in other species, recent equine studies have provided support to the concept that \u2018dysbiosis' could be an important inciting cause of various types of disease. With advanced sequencing technologies emerging, one potentially important and yet underexplored area of study involves the therapeutic manipulation of the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota in equine cases.",

The earliest written reference to FMT or \u2018transfaunation' in veterinary medicine is attributed to the 17th century Italian anatomist Fabricius Aquapendente who observed that cud taken directly from a healthy animal and placed in the mouth of an animal that had lost its capacity to ruminate would result in restoration of rumination and health (Borody et al. 2004). Rumen transfaunation remains a common treatment for a range of GI disorders in cattle (DePeters and George 2014). Whilst there are no peer\u2010reviewed studies of FMT in horses, equine practitioners have a history of providing nasogastric (NG) administration of \u2018faecal tea' from healthy horses to horses with diarrhoea with anecdotal reports of success (Feary and Hassel 2006). Additionally, there is a multitude of commercial over\u2010the\u2010counter probiotic products for horses used clinically in the prevention and treatment of a variety of GI disorders, attempting to provide a more \u2018refined' approach to microbiota replacement. While generally regarded as safe, efficacy data are limited and a recent review of probiotic use in horses highlights the need for blinded, placebo\u2010controlled efficacy trials to investigate their health benefits (Schoster et al. 2014). It was suggested that research emphasis should be placed on investigating the clinical outcomes related to administration of probiotic products that contain the bacterial species most abundant in the intestinal microbiota of healthy horses, species that tend to be different than those found in commercial probiotics (Schoster et al. 2014).",

The only randomised\u2010controlled trial (RCT) evaluating FMT was terminated prematurely as the procedure proved to be considerably more effective in treating recurrent CDI than antibiotics alone (van Nood et al. 2013). A total of 15 of 16 patients who underwent FMT were cured; 13 patients after just one duodenal infusion of donor faeces compared with 4 of 13 patients who received the standard vancomycin treatment. Those successfully cured with FMT demonstrated increased microbiota diversity similar to that of the donor following treatment (van Nood et al. 2013). Although this trial included only a small number of patients, it generated tremendous interest in FMT in both the scientific community and popular press. With the success of FMT in treating recurrent CDI and emerging evidence of efficacy in other inflammatory GI conditions, such as severe CDI in immunocompromised patients (Kelly et al. 2014), severe CDI refractory to conventional medical therapy (Zainah et al. 2015) and ulcerative colitis (Colman and Rubin 2014), its utility in treating other GI and non\u2010GI disorders, is being actively investigated (Aroniadis and Brandt 2013). However, treatment for CDI is currently the only approved use of FMT in man. The purpose of this paper is to review the current literature on FMT and transfaunation in man and animals, propose some initial guidelines for its application in equine medicine and outline areas for future study.",

            "text": "Recent evidence indicates that the microorganisms that make up the intestinal microbiota are integrally involved in host homeostasis and alterations have been associated with a variety of disease processes in man, including many not previously associated with the gut or an infectious aetiology (e.g. chronic fatigue syndrome, autoimmune and neurological disorders, atherosclerosis and obesity) (Borody and Khortus 2012; Aroniadis and Brandt 2013; Smits et al. 2013). Much attention has been paid recently to the potential impacts of the microbiota on allergic and inflammatory conditions beyond the gut as mounting evidence clearly illustrates the role of the gut microbiota in systemic inflammation and immune tolerance (Van den Abbeele et al. 2011; Kamada et al. 2013). Studies in germ\u2010free mice demonstrate that intestinal microbiota plays a vital role in physiological intestinal peristalsis, intestinal epithelial cell functions, development of the gut\u2010associated immune system, systemic immunity, nutrition and metabolism (Frick and Autenrieth 2013). The GI microbiota produces antimicrobial products, competes directly for nutrients with pathogens, inhibits or inactivates bacterial toxins and produces bacteriocins and short\u2010chain fatty acids that inhibit growth of pathogens and pathobionts (Kamada et al. 2013). The microbiota has also been shown to modify virulence factor expression of pathogens and facilitate host barrier function through upregulation of mucus production, antimicrobial molecules and secretion of IgA (Kamada et al. 2013).",

            "text": "Disruption of existing microbial communities has been implicated in the pathophysiology of CDI and may be an important factor in acute, undifferentiated and antibiotic\u2010induced colitis in horses. Clostridium difficile is a normal inhabitant of the large intestine of a small percentage of healthy horses and man (Schoster et al. 2012; Petrof and Khortus 2014). In most colonised individuals, toxigenic strains of C. difficile do not produce disease, likely through inhibitory effects of the protective commensal microbiota. However, alteration of this complex balance can result in an environment where C. difficile can proliferate, produce toxins and cause disease. Antimicrobial administration has a profound and prolonged impact on the normal intestinal microbiota in horses and man (Jakobsson et al. 2010; Stevens et al. 2011; Harlow et al. 2013; Modi et al. 2014; Costa et al. 2015b) and has been suggested as a risk factor for CDI in both species (B\u00e5verud et al. 1997; Barr et al. 2013; Petrof and Khortus 2014). High throughput sequencing demonstrated that TMS administered per os to healthy horses had a greater effect than procaine penicillin intramuscularly (i.m.) or ceftiofur i.m. on the intestinal microbiota, with impacts on the faecal microbiota community structure persisting 25 days after the end of treatment (study endpoint) for all antibiotic\u2010treated horses (Costa et al. 2015b). Other risk factors for CDI in horses include stressors such as transportation, hospitalisation, presurgical fasting, medical, or surgical treatment of GI or other disorders (B\u00e5verud et al. 1997). In man, a similar range of factors is associated with increased risk of CDI, including a recent focus on the potential role of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), a class of medication also commonly used in horses, as a risk factor (Barletta and Sclar 2014).",

When conventional treatment (e.g. cessation of the inciting antimicrobial and use of antibiotics against C. difficile) fails, FMT may be an effective means of restoring the normal intestinal microbiota and treating CDI, particularly recurrent CDI. Potential mechanisms of action of FMT include competition for limited resources, direct elimination of C. difficile, interference with its pathogenicity by microbial products that neutralise toxins, restoration of secondary bile acid metabolism in colon and induction of immune\u2010mediated resistance (Britton and Young 2014; Petrof and Khortus 2014). Some studies indicate that human patients receiving FMT for treatment of recurrent CDI commonly have clinical resolution of diarrhoea before they have evidence of faecal microbiota recovery (Khoruts et al. 2010; van Nood et al. 2013; Song et al. 2013) suggesting that the resolution of diarrhoea is related to factors other than full restoration of gut microbiota as represented by the faecal microbiota (a reasonable but incomplete proxy for the proximal intestinal tract). If stable engraftment of transplanted microbes occurs, it may take some time to achieve. Alternatively, the key for clinical resolution may not be development of an overall microbiota akin to the donor but restoration of key components (e.g. Lachnospiraceae). The potential mechanisms by which FMT improves outcome in other GI and non\u2010GI disorders are being actively investigated, as is the determination of the direction of causality and reversibility of these conditions (Aroniadis and Brandt 2013; Smits et al. 2013; Khoruts and Weingarden 2014).",

Earliest procedures were nonstandardised and delivered via enema, colonoscopy, nasoduodenal or nasogastric tube (Gough et al. 2011; Aroniadis and Brandt 2013). Standardisation and cryopreservation protocols have since been described (Hamilton et al. 2012; Petrof and Khortus 2014; Satokari et al. 2015). However, the need for cryopreservatives is unclear and a randomised clinical trial in man comparing fresh vs. frozen (without cryopreservative) stool showed lack of inferiority of frozen stool (S. Weese, unpublished data). Typically, each FMT dose is from a single donor to limit risk of disease transmission (Khoruts and Weingarden 2014). Donor screening tends to be intensive and expensive to reduce the risk of transmission of enteric or bloodborne pathogens or infusion of antigens (Table 1). These guidelines are not strictly evidence\u2010based and optimal practices are unknown (Allen\u2010Vercoe et al. 2012). In addition, research is needed to explore the potential transfer of antimicrobial resistance genes on plasmids or in the genome of donated bacteria (Dicks et al. 2014).",

Interestingly, there are very few reports of complications although patients receiving FMT are often debilitated, elderly or immunocompromised with multiple systemic problems and disruption of the gut mucosal barrier (Khoruts and Weingarden 2014). Complications reported possibly associated with upper GI FMT delivery include upper GI bleeding, enteritis and peritonitis; no mortality associated with FMT was reported in 11 studies of FMT for CDI (Kassam et al. 2013). No severe adverse events directly attributed to FMT were reported in the studies in other reviews (Gough et al. 2011; Cammarota et al. 2014) and there was no difference in clinical outcomes in anonymous vs. patient selected donors (Kassam et al. 2013).",

Rumen fluid from an alfalfa\u2010fed steer transferred into a protozoa\u2010free sheep\u2010fed alfalfa resulted in establishment of all 24 species of protozoa within the sheep rumen (Dehority 1978), indicating that protozoa can successfully be transferred between host and recipient. While rumen fluid is known to contain viable microbes, volatile fatty acids, bicarbonate buffers and proteins, there are many yet unidentified components (DePeters and George 2014).

Rumen transfaunation improved health and survival of calves in a herd experiencing bloody diarrhoea and death in preweaned calves (Pounden and Hibbs 1949).

Recently, Jing et al. (2014) reported that systemically administered endotoxin will alter the rumen microbiota. It is as yet unknown if transfaunation can restore the perturbations in rumen microbiota caused by systemic endotoxin; however, our clinical impression that transfaunation improves appetite and outcome in cows with toxic mastitis supports this premise.",

As hindgut fermenters, horses have an intestinal tract profoundly different from man and ruminants. The types of chronic disease usually targeted by FMT in those species also have little relationship to important problems in horses. Due to the long small colon in the horse, FMT via enema may not be effective and to the authors' knowledge has not been investigated. Faecal microbiota transplant in horses has thus far been limited to administration via NG intubation. Efficacy of this route may be reduced due to bacterial inhibition and degradation by gastric acid, small intestinal enzymatic digestion and competition and degradation in the caecum due to fermentation. Therefore, while the clear impact of FMT in man and rumen transfaunation provides proof of concept, equine specific study is required. In a small case series, 3 out 4 horses with antibiotic\u2010induced or undifferentiated colitis had an improvement in faecal consistency following treatment with FMT (Mullen et al. 2014). One author (T.J.D.) used fresh caecal transfaunation successfully in a horse with severe, subacute CDI, with normal manure consistency returning 12 h post treatment. Chronic diarrhoea, although uncommon in the horse, has anecdotally responded to treatment with FMT (Feary and Hassel 2006; McGovern 2013). Caecal contents collected from a recently deceased horse or faeces obtained from rectal evacuation of a healthy horse provided the transfaunate (Feary and Hassel 2006). These findings do provide initial support to the potential efficacy of FMT in horses; however, the variable and sometimes self\u2010limiting nature of GI disease precludes a definitive assessment of efficacy from studies such as these.",

Antibiotic\u2010induced and undifferentiated colitis and IBD, which has been associated with changes in the gut microbiota in man (Aroniadis and Brandt 2013; Smits et al. 2013) and dogs (Minamoto et al. 2015), may be potential candidates for additional FMT research in horses. Yasuda et al. (2015) demonstrated differences in the composition of the luminal and mucosal GI microbiota in rhesus macaques and preliminary results show a difference between the composition of the equine GI luminal and mucosal microbiota (K. Yasuda, unpublished data). As diseases such as IBD may be associated with perturbations in the mucosal microbiota, developing preparations to restore the mucosal microbiota health in horses with IBD might be helpful in ameliorating clinical signs. Based on findings in mice where intestinal microflora promotes peristalsis (Husebye et al. 1994), duodenitis/proximal jejunitis (DPJ) and ileus may be disorders that would benefit from FMT treatment, but further research in horses is needed.",

Unlike in man, recurrent CDI is uncommon in the horse, with most equine CDI cases presenting as severe, acute enterocolitis. Moreover, acute, undifferentiated colitis is more common than CDI in horses. Regardless of the indication, administration of FMT may present a risk of donor\u2010associated bacteraemia, although this treatment has been used in human patients with compromised mucosal barrier function and concurrent treatment with immunosuppressive medications without complications (Khoruts and Weingarden 2014) and infusion of a small volume of faeces relative to the amount of intestinal content already present would seem to be of limited additional risk. Additionally, restoration of normal commensals may actually improve IL\u20101\u03b2 recruitment of neutrophils to the gut mucosa and protect against septic complications (Hasegawa et al. 2012).",

Preliminary guidelines based on limited data, extrapolation from the literature in man and expert opinions are provided (Table 2). Although adverse events associated with FMT in horses have not been reported, disease transmission from donor to recipient is possible (Naylor and Dunkel 2009) and proposed screening tests for donors are provided in Table 2. For foals undergoing FMT, the dam would make a suitable donor provided the screening criteria are met. Fresh faeces should be collected from the rectum of the screened donor, or caecal contents could be collected from horses that fit the inclusion criteria above and which are to be subjected to euthanasia because of an acute, noninfectious and non\u2010GI disease event (e.g. acute, catastrophic musculoskeletal injury). Studies comparing the microbiota of the caecum and faeces have had variable results with some studies suggesting significant differences in population structure between the two (Dougal et al. 2012; Costa et al. 2015a) and others finding the highest similarity between the composition of the microbiota in the faeces and caecum vs. other intestinal compartments (Schoster et al. 2013). However, there are no data to suggest whether caecal contents or faeces constitute a preferred transfaunate.",

However, we simply do not know the impact of storage temperature and time on efficacy and in the absence of evidence fresh FMT is probably best. Discontinuation of antimicrobials before FMT as well as pretreatment with PPIs, similar to the human protocol, have been recommended to diminish antimicrobial and gastric acid\u2010induced bacterial inhibition, but remains speculative (Feary and Hassel 2006). Following omeprazole 4 mg/kg bwt per os every 24 h, intragastric pH in clinically ill and clinically normal neonatal foals and healthy adult horses was significantly increased by 1, 2 and 48 h (first time point measured), respectively (Merritt et al. 2003; Sanchez et al. 2004; Javsicas and Sanchez 2008), suggesting that only a short pretreatment period with a PPI is needed to increase intragastric pH before FMT in horses.

It is likely that more important than achieving stable engraftment of the host microbiota in the recipient is establishing some key populations (e.g. Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae and perhaps other butyrate or acetate producers). The best way to deliver these bacteria (FMT, probiotic products or stool substitutes) needs to be evaluated. The use of shelf\u2010stable stool substitutes made from purified isolates from a healthy donor (Petrof et al. 2013) would eliminate the need for donor screening and could improve accessibility and our ability to perform controlled efficacy studies. Research is needed to investigate the efficacy of FMT/stool substitutes for treatment of specific equine GI diseases including acute and chronic diarrhoea, IBD, DPJ and post foaling colic and for prophylactic use in, for instance, horses undergoing surgical procedures, horses being treated with antimicrobials and post partum mares. With the recent developments in understanding how the microbiota changes in various disease states, therapies aimed at microbiota restoration may represent the next frontier in equine gastroenterology.",
