China has learned important lessons from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003. One effective measure in China was the establishment of fever clinics for confirmed and suspected patients [7]. Isolated wards and buildings (when possible) need to be set up to place newly admitted confirmed and suspected patients. In this early phase of the coronavirus pandemic, propagation of nosocomial infections lead to increased outpatients visits occurred in multiple clinics of Wuhan city. Against this background, national triage strategies to screen for COVID-19 were developed. Normally, fever clinic is not mandatory for patients with any acute respiratory symptoms or fever in China. During the epidemic, in order to minimize unnecessary clinics and hospitals patient visits, fever clinics are set up by repurposing existing ones in dedicated hospitals. Good public access is essential. Medical staff needs high levels of protection and must be well trained in the use of PPE. Use of a fever clinic potentially limits the risk of health-care workers exposure to the virus because tasked expertise is concentrated. The diverting function of a triage strategy makes more health-care workers available to maintain workforce capabilities. Home care isolation can relieve the burden on health-care workers in response to the large volume of suspected patients arriving at clinics, but we do not generally recommend this because of the physical and mental health risks for patients.",

Patients with suspicious symptoms should be separated from the rest of the patient population in fever clinics. Social distancing is important in clinics, keeping the distance between chairs in the waiting-room and the distance between doctors and patients six feet apart. It is essential to provide surgical facemasks to all patients especially during the examinations. Cleaners should utilize regular droplet precautions (surgical mask, gloves, and gown) and disinfect all surfaces after each consultation. Mandatory use of separate team in every clinic and ward can avoid health-care-related transmission and maintain workforce capabilities by avoiding the necessary laboratory testing and fourteen-day self-quarantine required for those exposed to an infected person or with any respiratory symptoms. We recommend that front-line health care workers in the solation areas should be provided with isolated accommodation. When their duty rotation finishes, they should be tested for COVID-19 and self-quarantine before going back to their communities even if the results is negative.",

At that time, no health care workers did not realize that this patient was infected by coronavirus and did not take appropriate protective measures during the OR and wards.

In China, nucleic acids test (PCR), antibodies test and chest CT scan are required to be completed in one day before admission. Nucleic acids test, which is largely affected by sampling procedure, has the highest false negative rates (sensitivity rate 30-50%). The novel coronavirus-specific IgM antibody can be tested positive in 3-5 days post-infection. Due to the limited laboratory testing capabilities, the diagnosis in many clinics cannot be based solely on laboratory testing, therefore a combination with chest CT (sensitivity rate nearly 60%) is proven to be effective during the early stage of the outbreak in Wuhan. If all tests are negative, the patient can be placed in a transitional ward waiting for another nucleic acid test in 24 hours. If the patient with negative results again then they will be transferred to the general ward. Any suspected positive patients should be placed in a dedicated building or ward. Patients with uncertain results after all tests should be observed and quarantined for 14 days before elective surgery.",

The number of staff (5-6 persons) in the dedicated operating theatre should be minimized strictly. Surgeons should not be in the OR when perform intubation which is considered as an aerosol generating procedure. Video laryngoscope can avoid close contact of anesthetist with patient. Before the end of the operation, it is recommended to clean the airway and oral secretions under deep anesthesia, and remove the tracheal tube before the patient is awake [12]. The Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) and European Association of Endoscopic Surgery (EAES) recently released their Recommendations Regarding Surgical Response to COVID-19 Crisis. They highlighted the risk of virus release during laparoscopy with pneumoperitoneum and strongly suggested the use of devices to filter released carbon dioxide for aerosolized particles [13]. Smoke evacuation systems with appropriate filters may reduce the risk of exposure, and using electrosurgical equipment at the lowest effective power as possible, but the complete elimination of surgical smoke is practically unrealistic. From the experiences we gained in China, open surgery is preferred with a surgical team wearing full-body PPE. Laparoscopic surgery can be gradually performed for elective surgery in well controlled area after the preoperative screening. Because of the shortage of PPE, it is sometimes impossible to provide full-body PPE for all staff at all operations. For facilities with comprehensive screening and isolation conditions, normal levels of protection can be used including disposable surgical cap, N95 mask, work uniform, disposable medical protective uniform, disposable latex gloves and goggles.",

In China, the lowest standard of PPE that the government recommended for the staffs in general clinic or ward is surgical masks [15]. For fever clinic or other high-risk area, N95 respirators and goggles are required. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of US has released a series of recommendations to optimize the application of PPE especially N95 respirators. The ideal way to prevent airborne transmission is to use a combination of hierarchy controls strategies, including elimination, substitution, engineering controls, administrative controls and PPE [16]. Before engaging in any work of caring patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, the staff must undergo strict training and be certified by the facility to ensure that they know how to put on and remove PPE correctly. To minimize the unnecessary change PPE, staff should reduce the frequency of moving in and out of the isolation wards.",
