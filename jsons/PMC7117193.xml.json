This population increase has led to severe ecological damage and agricultural losses. The only report of swine pathogens on Guam was limited to domestic pigs (Dugies et al., 2000). The lack of data on pathogens in wild pigs is a concern as increased swine populations have led to increased pig-human interactions. Recent reports of leptospirosis in residents and tourists is one concern and although rodents tend be considered the most common reservoir of Leptospira, there is evidence of Leptospira in domestic swine on Guam (Dugies et al., 2000), and wild pigs in numerous countries have antibodies to leptospires (Jansen et al., 2007, Corn et al., 1986).",

Although known to occur on Guam among domestic pigs, prevalence was unknown (Duguies et al., 2000, Boss\u00e9 et al., 2002). Clinical disease and mortality resulting from infection with one or more APP serotypes can vary geographically; however, serotype 2 has been consistently associated with morbidity and mortality in domestic pigs (Baroch et al., 2015). Over half of the wild pigs from Guam had antibodies for serotypes 1-2-9-11. Reproductive disease in domestic pigs due to porcine parvovirus (PPV) has been reported on Guam (Duguies et al., 2000, Ruiz-Fons et al., 2006). In addition to reproductive failure due to PPV infection, coinfection with porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) in domestic pigs can result in mortalities (Ellis et al., 2000). We report in wild pigs the first evidence of PCV2 on Guam; surveillance and vaccination for these pathogens may be warranted. L. intracellularis has been documented worldwide in domestic and wild pigs and is the etiologic agent of proliferative enteropathy (Chiriboga et al., 1999). The high prevalence of these three pathogens in wild pigs, indicates that transmission to domestic pigs is a risk.",

Leptospirosis is a growing concern in Guam (Mason et al., 1998). While exposure to several serotypes was detected, prevalence is likely underestimated because antigens from serotypes readily available for testing in our US laboratory were used rather than those likely present in Guam/other Pacific nations. Regardless, exposure of pigs does not implicate them in human cases due to the diverse reservoir-range, but suggests that proper PPE should be utilized when in contact with pigs. Domestic pigs have not been previously tested for T. gondii but evidence of T. gondii was noted in goats (Duguies et al., 2000). This parasite has a wide host range and can pose a risk to native avian fauna that do not have an evolutionary history with the parasite (Work et al., 2000). In addition, T. gondii is zoonotic; due to the popularity of wild pig hunting for sport and population management, hunters in Guam should properly butcher and cook wild pig meat (Hill et al., 2014, Conry, 1988).",

No evidence of exposure to Trichinella spp., IAV, or coronaviruses associated with enteric and respiratory disease was found; one pig had antibodies to porcine epidemic diarrhea virus. Previously, Trichinella was absent from domestic pigs, but because of the zoonotic potential of this parasite, surveillance and education campaigns to ensure pork is thoroughly cooked (which would also kill any T. gondii present) should continue. Swine influenza, a zoonosis, is relatively common in domestic pigs worldwide, but exposure of wild pigs is not ubiquitous and varies geographically (Smith et al., 2009). While prevalence was high in a study in southern China (Luo et al., 2013), in Korea, the US and Spain, seroprevalence was generally low (<20%) and varied seasonally; it is possible that our sample size was insufficient to detect exposure in Guam (Hall et al., 2008, Corn et al., 2009, Feng et al., 2014). Enteric and respiratory coronaviruses, which have been reported in several Asian countries, are of significant concern due to high morbidity and mortality in na\u00efve pig populations (Song and Park, 2012). Porcine epidemic disease virus is clinically similar to transmissible gastroenteritis; both are coronaviruses that can lead to acute diarrhea in all age groups of swine, often resulting in poor body condition or mortalities (Lee, 2015). One wild pig had antibodies to Brucella; the species could not be distinguished based on serologic testing. Serology indicates if Brucella is present in a population, but culture and/or advanced molecular assays are required to confirm species (Leiser et al., 2013). Brucellosis, a zoonotic disease, has been documented in wild pig populations globally (Leiser et al., 2013).",

H. suis can transmit swine poxvirus and classical swine fever virus but there is no evidence that these viruses are present on Guam. Amblyomma breviscutatum were found on several pigs but little is known about this tick species; it is believed to have been historically present on Guam and other islands in greater Micronesia (Vander Velde and Vander Velde, 2013). Currently, there are no data on pathogens associated with A. breviscutatum. Our testing method for helminth parasites was limited due to time and importation restrictions; we only examined small sections of lung tissue (or lesions if noted). Confirmed infections with Metastrongylus lungworms and S. dentatus were relatively common, and likely under-recognized because of testing method. Both Metastrongylus lungworms and S. dentatus, previously reported in domestic pigs on Guam, can impact domestic pig health (Duguies et al., 2000).",

We detected serologic evidence for multiple zoonotic pathogens, necessitating simple yet effective preventative measures. Wearing appropriate PPE, practicing good hygiene, washing all utensils and surfaces that have come into contact with butchered wild pigs, and thoroughly cooking meat prior to consumption may assist in preventing infection. Management of wild pigs is often controversial as they are seen as a food source for hunters or in some cases may be considered native species. The wild pig populations on Guam are not native, harbor pathogens of importance to domestic swine and people, and very importantly, cause major damage to the environment leading to economic losses for farmers and extreme habitat destruction for native species of wildlife.",
