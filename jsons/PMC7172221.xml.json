This is similar to that reported by other studies,14, 15, 16 All the HBoV strains clustered in the ST2 genotype, as previously identified in mainland China and Hong Kong in children with LRTI.28, 29 The limited number of specimens studied, however, does not preclude the possible presence of the ST1 genotype of HBoV. Interestingly, higher HBoV positivity and load were observed in throat swabs (n\n = 96) than in nasal swabs (n\n = 78), suggesting an infection preferentially of the lower respiratory tract, as indicated by previous studies on bronchoalveolar lavage (Fig. 4\n).11, 30, 31 In addition, HBoV was detected in sera of infected children, as previously observed with other parvoviruses.1 Consistent with other reports, samples with high copies of HBoV detected in nasal and throat swabs were more frequently positive in sera, compared with those with low copies,5, 6, 20, 24 suggesting that viremia often occurs during acute infection.",

The high ratio of these two co-infecting viruses may reflect their prevalence in children visiting the Pediatrics Department of Shanghai Nanxiang Hospital with ARI (Wang and Deubel, unpublished data). In addition, the percentage of HBoV-positive patients with co-infecting viruses was 47.6%, suggesting a correlation between the presence of HBoV and that of other respiratory viruses (p\n < 0.0001). Patients with lower copies of HBoV were more frequently associated with co-infection, as previously reported.32, 33 Conversely, data published in a recent paper25 reported a higher co-infection rate in patients with high HBoV load. It was probably due to a different pool of samples. Notably, all the six triple infections and one quadruple infection appeared in patients with low HBoV load in swabs (data not shown). HBoV infection may be maintained to low copies in some individuals by an as yet unresolved interfering process triggered by the presence of the co-infecting agent. Whether HBoV exacerbates other viral infections or appears in children infected with other viruses is difficult to address and would require further studies.",

            "text": "Previous studies reported that the majority of epitopes recognized by antibodies in HBoV-infected patients were located in the VP2 protein.20 In this study, we divided VP2 into 4 fragments (P1\u2013P4) and tested their antigenic reactivity by Western blot. Sixteen of 20 sera contained IgG/IgM antibodies that reacted with VP2 and its P3 fragment, and four did not show reactivity with VP2 and any of the four fragments. Strong immunoreactivity with IgG and IgM was observed for fragment P3, consistent with results with the whole VP2 protein. However, preparation of large amounts of purified P3 antigen in E. coli is easier and cheaper than that of VP2, which requires a more tedious preparation in the baculovirus system. Therefore, the purified P3 fragment of VP2 represents an alternative antigen for IgG detection in ELISA to test for acute or recent infection. It remains to be determined, however, whether this polypeptide is still recognized by long lasting antibodies to prevent false negative result for past HBoV infection.20, 24, 33 The number of IgG-positive cases increased with the age of the children, suggesting that infection of HBoV likely occurred during childhood. The data validate other studies that showed a high number of IgG-positive serum samples in adults.23, 24 Since some previous studies reported the absence or only few cases of anti-HBoV IgM in virus-negative samples from children, and rare positive results in healthy adults,24, 25 only sera of patients confirmed with HBoV infection were tested by Western blot for IgM. Anti-HBoV IgM antibodies were likely detected more often in patients viremic for HBoV or with high copies of HBoV in nasal and throat swabs, as previously observed.20, 24, 25 In 11 patients with viremia, high copy number in swabs, and infected only by HBoV, 10 (90.9%) were IgM-positive, which is consistent with previous studies.20, 25 Patients infected singly with HBoV had comparatively more anti-HBoV IgM and IgG than multi-infection ones (p\n = 0.0119) (Table 4). In contrast, in 57 patients with low viral load in swab samples, the amount of IgG or IgM remained at a low level (data not shown).",

No fever or symptoms of the respiratory tract were noted in these patients. Low copies of HBoV were still found in nasal and throat swabs, serum, and urine, indicating that infection of HBoV may last for a long period of time at a low level, and in the presence of anti-HBoV antibodies (Table 5). This situation was also observed in parvovirus B19 infection with systemic and long-term persistent infection, high IgG reactivity and activated CD8+ T cell responses.36 All ten patients with persistent PCR positivity of HBoV were found to be free of respiratory disease, but three were diagnosed with a secondary infection with ADV or HRV, suggesting that the persistence of HBoV was of less clinical significance, but may have played a role in promoting co-infection. Altogether, our study suggests that acute infection of HBoV causes systemic infection, induces immune responses, and may play a crucial role in respiratory disease of children, and is often associated with co-infection. Further studies are needed to understand the mechanism of the interactions between the host immune response, HBoV infection and prolonged virus shedding.",
