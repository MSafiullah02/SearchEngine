Businesses that rely heavily on face-to-face communication or close physical proximity when producing a product or providing a service are particularly vulnerable. There is, however, no systematic evidence about the role of human interactions across different lines of business and about which will be the most limited by social distancing. Here we provide theory-based measures of the reliance of U.S. businesses on human interaction, detailed by industry and geographic location. We find that 49 million workers work in occupations that rely heavily on face-to-face communication or require close physical proximity to other workers. Our model suggests that when businesses are forced to reduce worker contacts by half, they need a 12 percent wage subsidy to compensate for the disruption in communication. Retail, hotels and restaurants, arts and entertainment and schools are the most affected sectors. Our results can help target fiscal assistance to businesses that are most disrupted by social distancing.",

We build a model of communication to understand how limiting face-to-face interaction increases production costs. Without social distancing, workers specialize in a narrow range of tasks and interact with other workers completing other tasks. This division of labor reduces production costs but requires frequent contact between workers. In the model, the number of contacts per worker is the most frequent in high-population-density areas in businesses where the division of labor is important. When face-to-face interaction is limited, these are exactly the businesses that suffer the most.",

Second, communication may involve the customer (panel B). The benefit of more frequent interaction with the customer is a product or service that is better suited to their needs. Third, workers may need access to a key physical resource, such as a machine, vehicle or an oil well (panel C).

The third indicator takes into consideration the possibility that workers may need to be in physical proximity of one another even if they do not communicate. We create an index that shows how important physical presence is to perform a given job. As a next step, we calculate for each sector the share of workers whose job requires a high level of teamwork, customer contact and physical presence. We use the same sectoral breakdown as the Current Employment Statistics (CES) [32] . As all the indexes are an absolute value running from 0 to 100, we use 62.5 as a cutoff to define a job to be teamwork-intensive, customers contact-intensive or job that require physical presence from the worker.

Whether the share of telecommunication remains large in the long run depends crucially on how easily it substitutes for face-to-face interaction. In our model, the two are perfect substitutes with the only distinction that the efficiency of face-to-face meetings improves with population density, whereas telecommunication does not depend on agglomeration [23, 24, 16] . Previous work has found face-to-face communication to be more effective in high-intensity communication which is particularly helpful to overcome incentive problems in joint production [39, 40] . Data on internet flows suggests that telecommunication is not a good substitute for face-to-face meetings [41] . None of these papers discuss disruptions from social distancing measures. Further study of the modes of communication in the O*NET occupation survey can shed light on whether telecommunication can act as a low-cost substitute for face-to-face meetings.",

So it is conceivable that in a post-pandemic spatial equilibrium (not modeled here, but see [16] ), the agglomeration premium falls and firms find it less attractive to locate in cities. A poignant point of comparison is the increased threat of terrorism in major cities following devastating attacks on New York, Washington, London, Paris, Madrid, Moscow and Mumbai. The general conclusion about terror threat is that cities have remained resilient and a robust attractor of businesses [42, 43] . We speculate that epidemics and social distancing can be more detrimental to cities than terror threats, because they tear apart the very fabric of urban life. However, we have limited data to make further predictions.",
