They are associated with a wide range of clinical manifestations, ranging from mild respiratory illness to aseptic meningitis or even flaccid paralysis. Sequence analysis of the VP1 coding gene, which encodes important serotype-specific neutralization epitopes, has revealed four major genetic clusters of human enteroviruses. Phylogenetic analysis of VP1 sequences today forms the basis of a new classification scheme, in which enteroviruses are assigned to one of four species (enterovirus A to enterovirus D), with a continuously growing number of genotypes (http://www.picornaviridae.com).",
