This study generated Whole Genome data to determine the origin and pattern of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from the first six cases tested in The Gambia. Total RNA from SARS-CoV-2 was extracted from inactivated nasopharyngeal-oropharyngeal swabs of six cases and converted to cDNA following the ARTIC COVID-19 sequencing protocol. Libraries were constructed with the NEBNext ultra II DNA library prep kit for Illumina and Oxford Nanopore Ligation sequencing kit and sequenced on Illumina MiSeq and Nanopore GridION, respectively. Sequencing reads were mapped to the Wuhan reference 2 genome and compared to eleven other SARS-CoV-2 strains of Asian, European and American origins. A phylogenetic tree was constructed with the consensus genomes for local and non-African strains. Three of the Gambian strains had a European origin (UK and Spain), two strains were of Asian origin (Japan). In The Gambia, Nanopore and Illumina sequencers were successfully used to identify the sources of SARS-CoV-2 infection in COVID-19 cases.",

The Oxford Nanopore GridION and Illumina MiSeq platforms were utilized to sequence the viral genomes from four confirmed SARS-CoV-2, one inconclusive and one negative case by rRT-PCR. We also analysed the genomes of samples classified as indeterminate and negative by RT-PCR (COVID-19 detection assay) from two different cases respectively. For WGS, four SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases, one indeterminate case and one negative case were processed (Table 1 ). In one of the confirmed cases, different isolates from samples collected up to 10 days apart were sequenced. Of the 6 cases sequenced, 4 were male; 2 female, there was one death, two recoveries and two active cases. ",

Firstly, we used \"ARTIC Guppylex\" to remove chimeric reads from each sample with the following parameters (--min-length 400 -max-length 700). Filtered reads were then mapped to Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genomes (accession number MN908947.3) and compared to other strains from other countries (see supplementary table 1a) using MiniMAP2 (v2.17-r941). Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) were generated based on the reference and a consensus genome for each sample was generated using SAMTOOLS (v1.9). To further validate our results, we ran all genomes through the coronavirus typing tool (v1.13).Similarly, 250 bp paired end Illumina reads were quality checked using FASTQC(v0.11.5) 20 . Reads with only a minimum phred score of 30 were included in our downstream analysis. One sample which was SARS-CoV-2 negative by reversetranscription real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) was characterised as Bat coronavirus using kraken and thus excluded from the analysis. Filtered reads were then mapped to the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genomes (accession number MN908947.3) using BWA-mem (0.7.17-r1188). BCFtools Mpileup (v1.8) was used in creating a variant file. Finally, BCFtools consensus was used in generating the FASTA consensus sequence for each sample.",

The tree showed the genetic relation of strains isolated in The Gambian to the global circulating strains. Six genomes (4 samples from Case A, 1 from case D and 1 from case C) from the Gambian samples clustered with the European (Spanish and United Kingdom) SARS-CoV-2 strains. This is not surprising given that these patients had been in Europe before arriving in The Gambia. Although viruses are known to mutate and change rapidly, 21, 22 the viral genome of case A clustered on the same node at different time points indicating the patient was shedding the same virus with no observed polymorphism according to Nanopore results. Interestingly, the same samples sequenced on the MiSeq suggested polymorphism at day 10, resulting in a longer branch length compared to previous time points (Figure 3). Further analysis of the Illumina data showed seven more SNPs in the day 10 sample compared to the other time points. The SNP winked by the Nanopore phylogenetically, might have an associated higher error rate compared to the Illumina. Strains from cases C and D, both having travelled from France, were more closely related to the Spanish strain included for comparison. Though cases D and A travelled to The Gambia on the same flight, their strains had a different origin, indicating that they could have been infected independently, before the start of their journeys. The viral genome from case B who initiated travel from Bangladesh and then across four other countries, including Senegal, before arriving in The Gambia, clustered with a strain from Japan. This case may have contracted the infection in Asia and his travel history suggests he could have contributed to infections in other countries. The two isolates from case E at different time points clustered with strains from Japan as well.Interestingly, case E samples were indeterminate by rRT-PCR diagnostics, even though the outcome from multiple alignment showed no mismatch between the sequences and the primer set. The indeterminate diagnostic rRT-PCR result could be due to low sensitivity of the assay, an indication of low viral density of SARS-CoV-2 in the sample. Therefore, subsequent follow up for such cases is essential to further evaluate diagnosis and aid towards the understanding of the disease progression and the evolution of this novel virus strain under different case management environments.",
