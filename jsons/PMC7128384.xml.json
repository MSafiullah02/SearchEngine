However, the next day, he sought urgent care and was admitted with respiratory failure to the intensive care unit of a hospital.4 He unwittingly had transmitted the disease to at least 12 other guests and visitors to the 9th floor, with the result that the disease was spread quickly worldwide.2 On March 4, an individual who earlier had visited the 9th floor of the Hong Kong hotel was admitted to the Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong with respiratory symptoms for which he was treated for 7 days with a jet nebulizer four times a day.2\n",

Two days later, Dr. Carlo Urbani, a WHO official in Vietnam, reported an alarming number of patients being treated at the French Hospital for atypical pneumonia.2, 5 By March 5, secondary probable SARS cases were identified among healthcare workers in Hanoi, and at the urging of Dr. Urbani and his colleagues, Vietnam closed the hospital to new patients and visitors on March 11. Most of the hospital\u2019s staff remained in the hospital; some of them fell ill while others watched their colleagues sicken and die. Prompt action taken by a steering committee led by the health minister was instrumental in containing the disease.

Electron microscopic examination revealed ultrastructural features characteristic of coronaviruses. Reactivity with group I coronavirus polyclonal antibodies was revealed using immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence staining. The authors used consensus coronavirus primers designed to amplify a fragment of the polymerase gene by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to obtain a sequence that clearly identified the isolate as a unique coronavirus only distantly related to coronaviruses previously sequenced. Using specific diagnostic RT-PCR primers, they were able to identify several identical nucleotide sequences in 12 patients from several locations. Indirect fluorescent antibody tests and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays made with the new coronavirus isolate demonstrated a virus-specific serologic response. The authors suggested the name Urbani SARS-associated coronavirus as the nomenclature for this virus in honor of one of the authors on the paper, Dr. Carlo Urbani, who had died during the investigation of the initial SARS epidemic.",

They noted that the structures reveal a remarkable degree of conservation of the substrate-binding sites, which is further supported by recombinant SARS-CoV Mpro-mediated cleavage of a TGEV Mpro substrate. Molecular modeling suggests that available rhinovirus 3Cpro inhibitors may be modified to make them useful for treating SARS.",
