The ongoing Covid-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) is the third coronavirus epidemic of zoonotic origin to occur in the present century (Sun et al., 2020), which spread from a single city in China to the entire country within 30 days (Wu and McGoogan, 2020); and spread to nearly 72 countries in less than three months (Chinazzi et al., 2020). In essence, it is known to have affected \u2018all continents except Antarctica\u2019 (Acharya, 2020). On 12th March 2020, Covid-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) (Gautret et al., 2020). As of 17th April 2020, there have been 2,074,529 confirmed cases and 139,378 deaths worldwide due to Covid-19 as reported by the WHO (WHO, 2020).",

However, its spike (S) glycoprotein has a 10\u201320 times higher affinity to human ACE2 receptors as compared to SARS-CoV, leading to more chances of human-to-human transmission; though having a lesser mortality rate (average 3.4%) than that of SARS (9.6%) and MERS (35%) respectively (Guo et al., 2020).",

In the absence of any proven treatment option, many drugs are under investigation to control this disease with a potentially fatal outcome. Chloroquine is one of the widely used drugs, with in vitro evidence that it reduces viral replication (Deponti et al., 2017). A combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin has also been found to have a significant synergistic effect in reducing viral load and early recovery (Gautret et al., 2020). For severe disease, the use of steroids, passive antibodies, and selective cytokine blockade is suggested (Mehta et al., 2020). The role of NSAIDs and corticosteroids, however, is still controversial and not advisable at present (Russell et al., 2020). Antivirals such as interferon-\u03b1, lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, etc. are also being used as a tentative treatment for Covid-19 (Dong et al., 2020). Yet, as of now, there are no specific antiviral drugs or vaccines verified to be effective against SARS-CoV-2, hence the emphasis is being laid on preventive measures and symptomatic treatment (Jean et al., 2020).",

Although no direct evidence is available, some uncontrolled studies on traditional medicines suggest that they may have a direct efficacy on the virus. Unani medicine is one of the officially recognized traditional medicine systems of India, which are represented by the acronym AYUSH, i.e. Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy (Weeks, 2020). Unani, also sometimes referred to as the Greco-Arabian system of medicine originated with the teachings of Hippocrates and was improved and systematized by Arabian physicians. It was introduced into India during the 11th\u201313th century in the Mughal period (Subbarayappa, 2001). Unani system of medicine has a detailed description of drugs that are utilized in many infectious diseases, including respiratory infections (Vohora, 1986). Some of these drugs have been demonstrated to have specific antiviral (Cagno et al., 2015) and immunomodulatory (Nigar and Itrat, 2013) activity in various scientific studies. In this paper, we present an overview of Covid-19 and SARS-CoV-2, Unani concept of infectious and epidemic diseases and their preventive measures, and a possible approach to the management of Covid-19 with Unani medicine.",

Coronaviruses are a group of enveloped viruses with a spherical shape, having a non-segmented, single-stranded RNA genome with club-like projecting spikes on their surface (Phan, 2020a). SARS-CoV-2 was first isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage samples from three patients suffering from pneumonia of unidentified cause (Zhu et al., 2020). Structurally, the genome of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to other \u03b2-coronaviruses. It has a long coding strand on which five ORFs are identified: including ORF1ab polyprotein, spike (S) glycoprotein, envelope protein, membrane protein, and nucleocapsid protein (Phan, 2020a). The S glycoprotein is the primary target of antibodies and vaccines as it is surface-exposed (Walls et al., 2020).",

About 50\u201380% transmission of the virus is from asymptomatic carriers, hence transmission through speech droplets is considered as a significant mode of transmission of the disease. The virus can be transmitted directly through speech droplets, or through fomites (Anfinrud et al., 2020). Based on reports, it is estimated that 44% of the transmission can occur before the onset of symptoms (He et al., 2020). SARS-CoV-2 binds to the ACE2 receptors, which are present in abundance in the lungs and gastrointestinal tract. Viral RNA has also been detected in feces. Hence, an oro-fecal route of transmission is also considered. Air-borne transmission is not completely ruled out (Ling et al., 2020). There is also evidence that the virus can be transmitted through tears and body fluids if they come into contact with the mucosa of eyes, mouth or nose. Depending on the route of entry, the virus binds to ACE2 receptors and infects type-2 pneumocytes, ciliated bronchial epithelium of lungs (Rodriguez-Morales et al., 2020), or enterocytes of the small intestine. The virus has also been isolated in blood, indicting more routes of transmission (Guo et al., 2020).",

Unani medicine is based on the Hippocratic concepts of mizaj (temperament) and akhlat (humors) (Husain et al., 2010). Famous scholars of Unani medicine include Ibn Sina (Latinized as Avicenna, 980\u20131035 CE), Zakariya Razi (Latinized as Rhazes, 865\u2013925 CE), Ibn Rushd (Latinized as Averroes, 1126\u20131198 CE), and many more (Islam, 2018).",

However, there is an adequate understanding that certain ajsam-\ni\n-khabi\nth\na (literally translated as \u2018bad substances\u2019) can migrate from the diseased to healthy persons, and may cause diseases (Sina, 1878). This theory of contagion is advocated by a number of Unani scholars. According to Jalinoos (Latinized as Galen, 131\u2013199 CE), \u2018a physician should always keep an eye on changes of weather and air\u2019 (Qadeer, 2001). A treatise of Zakariya Razi (865\u2013925 CE), Kitab fi al-jadari wa-al-hasbah (Book on Smallpox and Measles) describes the modes of spread of the two diseases and their differential diagnosis. In May 1970, it was regarded as \u201cthe first scientific treatise on the subject\u201d by WHO (Islam, 2018). According to Ibn Sina (980\u20131035 CE), \u2018air and water are contaminated only after admixture of ajsam-\ni-khabitha, which does not happen otherwise\u2019. He further states, \u2018such contamination can also be brought about if the dead bodies of people dying due to an epidemic are not disposed of properly\u2019 (Sina, 1878).

In this context, the direction of winds is given utmost significance.

Also, we could not find any clinical trials on the health effects of herbal fumigants. Probably, for this reason, the studies, if at all conducted, report the effect of these drugs as insecticidal, acaricidal, etc. For some drugs such as H. verrucosa, O. europaea, etc., no studies were found where the drugs have been used for fumigation, although many herbal drugs are used as household incense in some countries (Lemenih et al., 2003). Hence, we rely on the information that they contain volatile oils rich in alcohol (J.

The newest of them, SARS-CoV-2, is, fortunately, lesser on virulence than its two recent predecessors, namely SARS-CoV and MERS, but higher in infectivity (Vellingiri et al., 2020). This simply implies that it has more chances of reaching the susceptible population and causing higher mortality. There is also speculation that close to two-thirds of Covid-19 cases from China may have gone undetected (Menkir et al., 2020).

Concepts of sanitation, isolation, air purification and immune-modulation described in Unani medicine remain the basic tenets of infection containment in the contemporary preventive medicine (Chinazzi et al., 2020). This necessitates a keen observation to uncover more treasure of knowledge from this ancient medicine system. Presently, in the absence of any decisive treatment available for Covid-19, stress is being laid on traditional medicine systems for providing the necessary protection (Vellingiri et al., 2020). Herbal medicines have several bioactive compounds such as phenols, vitamins, several antioxidants, etc. with important pharmacological activity. Hence they can play a significant role in reducing the disease burden in the contemporary world (J. Kim et al., 2016; Zeinali et al., 2019).",

Although at some places epidemics involving food and water-borne diseases, and plague, etc. have also been discussed (Razi, 2008; Sina, 1878), but most of the literature is dedicated to air-borne diseases which affect the respiratory system. It is possible because the most prevalent epidemics in the Muslim world during the medieval ages were plague, smallpox, chickenpox, etc. which are transmitted through fomites or respiratory route (Islam, 2018). The methods of air purification, and the drugs prescribed for the same (Table 1) e.g. Vinegar, Rosewater, fumigation with various resins such as loban, etc. are extremely noteworthy (Razi, 1991). Convincing scientific evidence is present which advocates the air-purifying activity of most of these drugs (J. Kim et al., 2016).",
