Of these, 34.1% had laboratory-confirmed disease, while the remainder had clinically suspected disease. 14 Their symptoms were typical of acute respiratory infections and included fever, cough, a sore throat, sneezing, myalgia and fatigue. A number of children were wheezing. Another study from the Wuhan Children's hospital, 52 which probably overlapped with the Dong et al study, 14 reviewed 171 children with confirmed disease and presented more detailed symptoms. The most common symptoms were cough (48.5%), pharyngeal erythema (46.2%) and a fever of at least 37.5\u00b0C (41.5%). 52 The authors reported that 32.1% of the children had fever above 38\u00b0C and that most of these had 38.1\u00b0C-39.0\u00b0C. 52 Other studies have suggested that fever in children is usually below 39\u00b0C. 7 Other symptoms 52 were diarrhoea (8.8%), fatigue (7.6%), rhinorrhoea (7.6%) and vomiting (6.4%). Four out of 171 children (2.3%) had low oxygen saturations of less than 92%. It should be noted that some COVID-19 publications have defined low oxygen saturation as below 93% or 94%. A substantial proportion of children demonstrated tachypnoea (28.7%) and tachycardia (42.1%) on hospital admission. 52 In a smaller case series of 10 Chinese children diagnosed outside Wuhan, eight had fever and six had a cough. 7 In a study that has only been published in Chinese so far, but was referenced by Yang et al, 45 76.1% of 134 children with COVID-19 had fever.",

Only two children (3.0%) experienced lymphocytopenia. 17 C-reactive protein and procalcitonin were increased in 13.6% and 10.6% of cases, respectively. 17 In a separate study that was not reviewed by Henry et al, lymphocytopenia was seen in 3.5% children. 52 The clinical spectrum of children with COVID-19 has often been similar to that of influenza. This was demonstrated by a Chinese study of 366 children up to the age of 16 years, who were hospitalised with respiratory symptoms in the early phase of the epidemic. 25 Many of these children did not have COVID-19 but were instead diagnosed with the influenza A or B virus. 25 ",

The report did not contain any information on the prevalence of these diseases in members of the general population who were a similar age. However, 67.2% of those who died from COVID-19 had a comorbidity and this higher prevalence 49 Coronavirus disease 2019 seems to have a milder course in children than in adults, and the obvious question is why? Several suggestions have been put forward. Children, especially smaller children, tend to have many viral infections. It is possible that repeated viral exposure supports the immune system when it responds to SARS-CoV-2. There have also been suggestions that the SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 58 and that children may be protected against SARS-CoV-2 because this enzyme is less mature at a younger age. The immune system undergoes substantial changes from birth to adulthood. 59 The proportion of children with COVID-19 with elevated inflammatory markers has reportedly been low. 17 Although the data are scarce, there seems to be little, if any, vertical intrauterine transmission from pregnant mothers to newborn infants. 10 Cord blood and placental tissue in COVID-19-positive mothers have been negative for SARS-COV2, 16 and in a small series of 30 offspring none of the subjects developed COVID-19. 30 However, it is worth noting that many of these children were delivered by Caesarean section. To what extent maternal hypoxaemia in delivering mothers can lead to intrauterine asphyxia and preterm birth in the offspring seems to be unknown.",

Smoking does not seem to be a major feature in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 in adults.3 It is important to note that a large share of the scientific evidence so far has originated from China, and it is possible thatcountry-specific factors there differ from children in some other countries. These include differences in day care and nutritional status and to what extent children come into contact with sick individuals. An expert consensus statement published by the World Journal of Pediatrics 32 in late January 2020 included a number of recommendations (Table 1). However, these were clearly based on findings from adults. More recent studies on children with COVID-19 are likely to have an impact on future recommendations. For instance, the current paediatric recommendations in China do not reflect the milder disease course and the different laboratory findings seen in children. 17,32 It can therefore be questioned whether children with mild COVID-19, normal inflammatory markers and normal oxygen levels should really undergo computed tomography or chest X-ray.",
