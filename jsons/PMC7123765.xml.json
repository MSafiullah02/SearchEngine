Ground-level ozone is a known pulmonary irritant and is the primary constituent of smog (Ebi and Mcgregor 2008). A number of Great Plains urban areas have issues with ozone compliance, but the Houston area in particular, has been in non-attainment of the EPA ozone standard since it was set in 1977 (Raun 2010). Higher temperatures may result in greater ozone formation because the chemical reactions resulting in ozone formation are temperature dependent (Bell et al. 2005a). In addition, biogenic volatile organic compounds, which are ozone precursors, increase as temperatures rise (Bell et al. 2005b).",

This is attributable to a variety of causes, including decreased vegetation, lower albedo from impervious surfaces, and urban building morphology (Grimm et al. 2008, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2008a). In urban areas with 1 million or more people, annual average air temperatures can be 2-5 \u00b0F (1-3 \u00b0C) higher than surrounding areas. On individual clear, calm nights the UHI can be as much as 22 \u00b0F (12 \u00b0C) warmer. Smaller cities and towns can create heat islands as well, although the urban-rural temperature differences often decrease as the city size decreases (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2008a). UHIs can act in conjunction with climate change to create more extreme temperatures.",

The headwaters of many Great Plains rivers are in the Rocky Mountains, and cities in the western part of the region, such as Denver, are often dependent on snowmelt. The snowpack acts as a natural and massive reservoir for water storage, holding water historically until late spring or early summer. Warming temperatures will not only result in a decreased amount of snow and reduced water storage in the snowpack, but it will also cause snow to melt earlier in the spring (Barnett et al. 2005). In the absence of precipitation changes, maximum runoff will shift to earlier in the season, further from the peak water demand months of July and August.",

            "text": "\nGreensburg, Kansas, serves as an example of a town that embraced sustainability and used a tragedy as an opportunity to rebuild in a greener manner. Prior to May 4, 2007, it was a rural town similar to other Great Plains farming communities. The energy structure of the town, developed in the 1960s, was similar to many rural towns in the Great Plains, with electricity created largely from coal-based sources. On the evening of May 4, 2007, an EF-5, 1.7-mile- (2.7-km) wide tornado with wind speeds over 200 mph (320 km per hour) hit the town, destroying or severely damaging 90% of its structures and killing 11 people.In the aftermath of the storm, community citizens resolved to rebuild a town that is prepared to face 21st century challenges. Key city leaders expressed interest in rebuilding a model green community, which generated enthusiasm among residents eager to demonstrate that challenges present opportunities and a disaster can be turned into a chance to foster resilience. The Department of Energy and other key organizations, including the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, quickly aligned their support and interest in helping Greensburg rebuild and demonstrate energy solutions that could be replicated in other communities. Other federal and state agencies, nonprofit, professional organizations and individuals reached out to Greensburg with professional expertise and donations of materials or cash.On August 15, 2007, the City of Greensburg adopted a Long-Term Community Recovery Plan that was prepared through FEMA\u2019s Long-Term Community Recovery program, which included strategies to rebuild sustainably. The residents then developed a Sustainable Comprehensive Master Plan for the town\u2019s next 20 years. It states, \u201cA truly sustainable community is one that balances the economic, ecological, and social impacts of development.\u201d In implementing the recovery plan, Greensburg has set a new standard for other rural and urban communities. It has become a net-zero energy community, generating as much electricity from renewable sources as it consumes. The city council passed a resolution requiring all new city buildings larger than 4,000 square feet (370 square meters) to reduce energy consumption by 42% (compared to standard buildings) and pass US Green Building Council LEED Platinum certification. An 11,000-BTU per second (12- megawatt) wind energy system will be installed near Greensburg that will meet its pre-tornado electricity needs. Additionally, the city has entered into a power purchase agreement from a renewable energy provider that will deliver 100% renewable electricity from wind, hydro, and other renewable energy electricity generation sources.Greensburg citizens acknowledge that there is potential for similar disasters in the future and have adopted building code standards to be better prepared for severe wind events. It has also embraced tornado preparedness education within the community, and schools have implemented programs to educate students about storm safety and sustainable living.

Consequently, reclaimed water must generally be pumped uphill for use.

The impacts of climate change and capacity to manage resulting challenges will vary across the region and within communities, just as households have differentiated vulnerabilities and coping mechanisms. A range of impacts will be felt across different communities, with some benefiting from climate-induced changes, and other facing devastating losses. Further regional research that improves upon current understanding of socio-economic and biophysical impacts of global change on rural communities would be useful to develop appropriate policies and mitigate negative consequences (Lal et al. 2011).",

However, the disproportionate percentage of rural counties (versus metro counties) reliant on agriculture as a primary source of economic activity suggests rural communities will experience the brunt of climate impacts on agriculture (Lal et al. 2011, USDA Economic Research Service 2012). If yields decrease, not only will profits and income be lowered, but families reliant on agriculture for subsistence will be doubly impacted by both a loss of income and food source. Similarly, farming communities are expected to experience additional water stress from climate change, particularly in counties reliant on irrigation. Chapter 4 details critical issues related to the effects climate change will have on water. Aquifers in the Great Plains continue to be tapped faster than the recharge rates, causing unsustainable water-use in the region (Barnett et al. 2008). Although urban areas are using more total water, the greatest percentage is surface-water. On average, rural communities (including agriculture) use more groundwater and almost eight times the total water of urban areas (U.S. Geological Survey 2005).",

Tribal communities are deeply connected to local ecosystems and are economically and culturally dependent on the fish, wildlife, plants, and other resources of their lands. However, this connection to the local ecosystems and ecosystem services also provides potential long-term solutions for adaptation as these strategies incorporate ecosystem services as part of these actions to deal with climate changes in their social-ecological system.

These water right issues are made even more complicated by the fact that these are often cross-jurisdictional, cutting across intersecting tribal, municipal, state, and federal boundaries. Various court cases have attempted to resolve these issues (e.g., Winters vs. US 1908, Arizona vs. California 1963), however, questions still are unsettled. In many areas of tribal lands, water infrastructure is in disrepair or lacking (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2011). According to a 2007 Indian Health Services Report, approximately 40,000 tribal homes in the Great Plains region had water supply deficiencies and 24,000 had deficiencies related to wastewater treatment (Rogers 2007). Roughly 9,700 homes completely lacked either a safe water supply system or a sewage disposal system or both (Rogers 2007). These conditions lead to increased vulnerability to climate extremes, and emergency fixes may take time to implement and can be costly. For instance, during a 2003 drought in the Missouri River Basin, Lake Oahe levels dropped so low that silt and sludge clogged the sole intake pipe at Fort Yates, North Dakota, cutting off the water supply for residents of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe for several days and causing an Indian Health Services hospital to be temporarily shut down. A temporary intake system was installed at a cost of about $3 million (Albrecht 2003, O\u2019Driscoll and Kenworthy 2005). Such situations across the Great Plains further affect people\u2019s well-being, and constrain their ability to further cope with other stresses in their socio-ecological system.",

In 2007, the Northern Cheyenne Tribe in Montana worked with a consulting firm to develop a Drought Mitigation Plan (Northern Cheyenne Tribe 2007).

As life spans increase, people in the elderly category will increase as well (Houser et al. 2000). Another group of people vulnerable to heat extremes are those with diabetes (Intertribal Council on Utility Policy n.d., Maynard 1998, Kovats and Hajat 2008). In Native American communities the adult-onset of diabetes has become pandemic (Houser et al. 2000). In tribes in North and South Dakota, one study found the prevalence rate of type-2 diabetes for people aged 45 to 74 to be 33% among men and 40% among women (Lee et al. 1995, Struthers et al. 2003) which is over 4 times the national average. Another factor that makes tribal communities more vulnerable to extreme heat is the high proportion of inadequate housing that provides little protection against excessive temperatures (Houser et al. 2000). Many tribal homes also lack air conditioning or insulation, and residents may not be able to afford the additional costs that air conditioning would entail. Moreover, nationwide, about 14% of Indian households have no access to any electricity, which is ten times the national average (1.4%) (Energy Information Administration 2000).",

Through green tags, the environmental benefits of wind or other renewable energy sources are quantified and sold as a commodity separate from the electricity itself, which is sold as a second commodity with no particular environmental attributes and at a price comparable to its fossil-fuel-based counterparts. An advantage of green tags is that they may be bought by individuals, organizations, or utilities anywhere in the US that would like to support renewable energy development. The tags thus allow consumers to support green power even if their local utility does not directly offer it, and they broaden the potential market for a renewable energy project.

Many native peoples from east of the Mississippi River were relocated from their traditional woodland homelands to unfamiliar, undeveloped, and often barren areas in the Southern Plains.

In addition, Lakota Solar Enterprises in collaboration with Trees, Water, and People, has implemented the Little Thunder single-home renewable energy demonstration project on the neighboring Rosebud Sioux Reservation, which includes photovoltaic solar panels, a small wind turbine, a solar air heater and a windbreak. These efforts provide additional opportunities in new jobs, more energy efficient housing, and renewable energy sources.At a larger scale, Great Plains tribal governments and communities as a whole may also be involved in and affected by energy production. Oil and gas operations on tribal lands provide income for the tribal governments in the form of leases and royalties. However, concerns about resulting water pollution and environmental contamination often compete with the desire to develop such resources for the benefit of tribal economic development (Maynard 1998). In some cases, large-scale renewable energy development also has serious impacts on Native communities. Hydroelectric power on the Missouri River has adversely affected Great Plains tribes through the historic relocation of riverside communities, the associated loss of their traditional environs, and the eventual erosion of culturally important gravesites (Gough 2002). Yet, these lands may be ideal for renewable energy production. The Great Plains are home to a phenomenal wind resource on millions of acres of unobstructed, undeveloped land (Garry et al. 2009, Koshmrl 2011). On reservation lands in North and South Dakota alone, the wind power potential is over 240 million BTUs per second (250 gigawatts) (Gough 2002). This is at least one hundred times the hydroelectric power produced by the six large dams on the Missouri River (30). Moreover, development of tribal wind power in the Great Plains could not only reduce greenhouse gas emissions but also help alleviate some of the current and future management demands on the Missouri River (Houser et al. 2000).However, there are certain considerations in development of energy resources on Native American lands. The Owl Feather War Bonnet wind energy project highlights some of these challenges (Garry et al. 2009). The Owl Feather War Bonnet concerns include consideration of protecting sacred sites and cultural resources (Gough 2002, Garry et al. 2009) in the siting requirements; consideration of tribal council involvement in agreements; and the need for development and access to transmission facilities (Garry et al. 2009). Additional legal issues are associated due to the unique status tribes hold as \u201cdomestic dependent nation status\u201d and the access to certain of the existing incentives in further developing energy resource (Garry et al. 2009).\n",

In addition, wildlife are associated with a number of diseases that are zoonotic (disease normally existing in animals that can infect humans) and play a key role in both the emergence of novel diseases and in the maintenance and spread of pathogens causing currently known diseases. Of the 1,415 infectious organisms known to cause disease in humans, 61% are zoonotic (Taylor et al. 2001, Jones et al. 2008). In addition, the incidence of emerging diseases has increased dramatically since 1940 and, primarily, has been caused by 1) newly evolved strains of pathogens, such as drug-resistant strains of bacteria and the Asian-strain of the H5N1 avian influenza virus; 2) pathogens that have recently entered populations for the first time, such as a corona virus-causing SARS in humans and Nipah virus in domestic swine; and 3) pathogens that have been present historically but have recently increased in incidence, such as Lyme disease in humans (Wolfe et al. 2007, Jones et al. 2008).",

Recent increases in incidence of emerging diseases in humans have largely been of zoonotic origin (60.3%), and 71.8% of these were caused by pathogens that originated in wildlife (Jones et al. 2008). In addition, there is an inextricable linkage among pathogens affecting wildlife, domestic animals, and humans, with these pathogens often originating in wildlife and subsequently moving to domestic animal hosts and then humans (Wolfe et al. 2007, Dobson and Foufopoulos 2011). In general, the effects of climate change in creating environments in the US for pathogens emerging outside of the country (e.g., Africa and Asia) have largely been overlooked. For example, if climate change fosters conditions for pathogens, such as Rift Valley fever virus from east Africa (Gerdes 2004), in the US, then introductions of those pathogens are more likely to take hold.",

Dynamic models of the effects of climate change on the global distribution of malaria predicted that climate change will expand the geographic distribution of malaria into North America (Martin and Lefebvre 1995, Martens et al. 1997, Rogers and Randolph 2000). However, the predictions on the extent of this spread vary considerably, depending on model structure and which climate change models were used. For example, Rogers and Randolph (2000) predicted that malaria will occur only in the southern portion of the Great Plains region, whereas Martin and Lefebvre (1995) predicted that, at least under one model, malaria would be more patchily distributed across the entire Great Plains region. Contrary to Epstein (2001) and Lafferty (2009, 2010) argued there is little evidence that existing climate changes have favored infectious diseases. More recent process-based models suggest range expansions or shifts, but little net increase in actual area because increases in habitat suitability for pathogens and vectors have been offset by decreases in habitat suitability elsewhere. This is supported by the models developed by Rogers and Randolph (2000) for malaria spread.",

Two of the hypotheses were also further explored by Harvell et al. (2002) in terms of R0 (basic reproductive ratio of a disease), which defines the number of secondary cases produced by an infected individual in an entirely susceptible population. When R0 < 1, the infection will die out in the long run and when R0 > 1, a pathogen will increase and the infection will be able to spread in a population. Hypothetically, increases in temperature not only allow the peak value of R0 to increase, but also lead to an increased annual duration of the period during which the pathogen is a problem.",

The Great Plains experienced damages associated with spring flooding along the Missouri and the Souris rivers in the northern portion, drought and fire losses in the southern region, and tornados in central and southern areas, adding to this total. These occurrences of natural disasters and extreme weather events are consistent with scientific predictions related to climate change.",
