Plants are a rich reservoir of a vast array of active constituents that have significant therapeutic applications like antiviral, anticancer, analgesic, antitubercular (Ishtiyak and Hussain, 2017; Uniyal et al., 2006). Among them, alkaloids are the important secondary metabolites that were initially discovered and used as early as 4000 years ago and are well recognized for their rich therapeutic potential (Amirkia and Heinrich, 2014). Based on their heterocyclic ring system and biosynthetic precursor, alkaloids are classified into diverse categories, viz. indole, purine, quinoline, isoquinoline, tropane, imidazole, among others (Kaur and Arora, 2015; Roy, 2017). Alkaloids have antiproliferative, antibacterial, antioxidant potential, which can be used for the development of drugs (Qiu et al., 2014). This therapeutic potential of alkaloids grows up their industrial application. Numerous research have been carried out in pharmaceutical properties of different alkaloids extracted from plants. In this chapter, we will systematically summarize the chemistry, isolation and identification techniques, biological activities along with potential applications in a single platform.",

A dose of reserpine 0.5 mg/day or greater attained the statistically significant SBP (systolic blood pressure) effects (Shamon and Perez, 2016). The underlying mechanism of the antihypertensive action of reserpine is, it reduces the catecholamines concentration from the peripheral sympathetic nerve endings. Reserpine has the higher affinity for VMAT2 (vesicular monoamine transporter), irreversibly binds to their receptors, and irrevocably blocks the VMAT2 (Schuldiner et al., 1993). VMATS is responsible for the transportation of released and free nor-adrenaline or nor-epinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin (5-HT) from the cytoplasm of the presynaptic nerve terminal into storage vesicles for further release into the synaptic cleft (Blackman et al., 1959; Nammi et al., 2005). Due to uptake obstruction, these unshielded and susceptible neurotransmitters never reach the synapse to exert their actions as they are metabolized by COMT (catecholamine-o-methyl transferase) and MAO (monoamine oxidase) in the cytoplasm. Reserpine has the higher affinity for VMAT2 and binds irreversibly to their receptors. It is a potent antihypertensive agent and tranquilizer, but its sustained usage stimulates the release of prolactin and causes breast cancer (Meenakshi and Priyanka, 2010).",

Another important parameter is compound stability. The stability of the compound depends on light, heat, and solvent polarity. Extraction is a separation technique of the desired compound from a matrix as in the case of soxhlet extraction and countercurrent extraction (Bhargavi et al., 2018; Fabricant and Farnsworth, 2001; Huie, 2002b; Pandey and Tripathi, 2014).",

For extraction of catechins, methanol is used as an ideal solvent. For procyanidins, 70% acetone is used. In the case of anthocyanins extraction, a slight acidic solvent is selected and thus 0.1% HCl in methanol is used. 7% acetic acid or 3% trifluoroacetic acid has been also used for the extraction of anthocyanins.

The percentage of alkaloids varies among species. Approximately 30 different tropane alkaloids have been found in all tissues (especially roots) of the plant, except the capsules and the woody portions of the roots and stems of some Datura species (like, D. stramonium var. stramonium, D. stramonium var. godronii, D. ceratocaula, D. stramonium var. tatula, etc.) (Berkov et al., 2006; Berkova and Zayed, 2004). Stems contain more amounts of tropane alkaloid than leaves, flowers, and seeds (Al-yahya and Evans, 1977; Philipov and Berkov, 2002; Lounasmaa and Tamminen, 1993; Vitale et al., 1995).",

Along with food safety, scientists also give attention to the variations of phytochemicals during food preservation. In some fruits like saskatoon berries, various processing techniques like air-drying, vacuum microwave-drying, and a combination of air-drying and vacuum microwave-drying can reduce the anthocyanin, phenolics content, and hence their antioxidant activity (Kwok et al., 2004). Leusink et al found that ORAC antioxidant activity of dehydrated cranberry products was increased by vacuum microwave-drying (Gwen et al., 2010). Freeze-drying degraded the antioxidant activity of cranberry than vacuum microwave-drying. In the microwave-drying, water molecules inside the food samples absorb more energy and allow it to reach in boiling point than any other drying methods (Majeed et al., 1995). A combinatorial application of both vacuum and microwave drying can facilitate the drying process without an increase in drying temperature, time, and oxygen intake (Oliveira and Franca, 2002). Apart from these two methods, freeze-drying has no severe effect on the phytochemicals of cranberries. Increase in the total antioxidant activity was observed after refractance window and freeze-drying than tray-drying, a combination of microwave and spouted bed drying (Nindoa et al., 2003).",

Plant tissue contains numbers of enzymes such as polyphenol oxidase (PPO), peroxidases, and glycosidases, which degraded the phenolic compounds. Anthocyanidins are very unstable and rapidly degraded produced by glycosidases. PPO accelerates the oxidation reaction of o-dihydro phenols to o-quinones that further counter brown polymers. The extent of peroxidases inactivation determines the effectiveness of blanching. Generally, blanching is done by steam or hot water and its time depends on the measurement of the food matrix, like for small food items (e.g., peas) are 1\u20132 min and for large-sizes food items (e.g., corn on the cob) are 11 min (Irondi et al., 2017). Blanching for a long time can damage the quality of food, whereas a shorter time can reduce the degree of enzyme inactivation and which results in reduced shelf-life, dietetic and efficient value.",

But in last decade, different nonthermal technologies such as ultrasound, high hydrostatic pressure, and the pulsed electric field (PEF) have been developed as substitute practices in food processing to advance nutritional qualities of the processed foods (Nayak et al., 2015). Application of ultrasound is responsible for degradation of compounds that control color, and anthocyanins is endorsed to (a) the antioxidant reaction that occurs by the interaction with free radicals produced during sonication; (Portenl\u00e4nger and Heusinger, 1992) (b) extreme physical conditions (like pressure up to 500 MPa at microscale level and temperature up to 5000 K) produce during sonication (L, 1988). High hydrostatic pressure treatments on vegetable and fruit foodstuffs are reliant on their matrices and different handling parameters like pressure, time, and temperature. A slight modification in the nutritional configuration (vitamins A, E, C, B1, B2, and folic acid), flavonoid content was observed in juices of apple, orange, lemon, and also mixed vegetable soup (Donsi et al., 1996; Quaglia et al., 1996; S\u00e1nchez-Moreno et al., 2009).",

No significant change observed in external anthocyanin content was observed while internal anthocyanin content was decreased significantly after being kept in CO2-treated atmosphere (Gil et al., 1997). This type of opposite behavior is due to a large amount of cyanidin 3-glucoside in peripheral tissue providing higher color stability, whereas pelargonidin glycosides exist in the internal tissue (Nayak et al., 2015).",

Enough scientific evidence is gathered in this chapter regarding various plant-based major types of alkaloids and their phytochemistry, isolation, identification, and biological activities. In conclusion, detailed research on their metabolic transformation, the introduction of a wide range of scientific tools, and cooperative teamwork of professionals among different scientific areas will accelerate the research on this hotspot and will provide new and important healthcare opportunities.",
