Besides environmental influences, socio\u2010economic factors also impact heavily on the epidemiology of tropical diseases. The tropics, which is the geographical region of the Earth centred on the equator and limited by the Tropic of Cancer on the north and the Tropic of Capricorn on the south, is also home to some of the poorest nations. Together with the movement of people triggered by globalization, mass migrations and climate change,2 these dynamics have a profound effect upon the patterns of respiratory tract infections in the tropics.",

This is shown by an emergence of tropical diseases in temperate regions, such as an outbreak of leptospirosis in 1998 in Springfield, Illinois in the United States,7 and an outbreak of human pneumonic plague in Colorado in 2014.8\n",

Otherwise, Gram\u2010negative organisms such as K. pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa represented the majority of cases detected. Similarly, Lin et al.37 described K. pneumoniae not only as a prevailing cause of CAP with bacteraemia in a Taiwanese tertiary hospital, but also showed that it was associated with a more fulminant clinical course and worse prognosis when compared with patients with S. pneumoniae CAP with bacteraemia. In a series of severe CAP cases in Singapore, patients who had Gram\u2010negative organisms isolated tended to have a worse outcome including a higher mortality, especially for patients with Pseudomonas and Burkholderia pseudomallei infections.38 This has changed the way local clinicians initiate their empiric treatment for patients admitted for severe CAP, with antibiotics deliberately chosen to cover Gram\u2010negative organisms, melioidosis as well as Gram\u2010positive pathogens. A systematic review by Goyet et al.39 looking at resistance patterns of CAP pathogens in Cambodia and neighbouring countries showed that up to 14% of S. pneumoniae and 26.5% of K. pneumoniae were resistant to amoxicillin\u2010clavulanic acid. Streptococcus pneumoniae also displayed a high resistance to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (average of 78.2%) and wide range of resistance patterns to cephalosporins: between 5.7% and 33.3% to ceftriaxone, and up to 47.4% to cefuroxime. There was also a mean high\u2010level resistance rate to penicillin G of 25.2%. Burkholderia pseudomallei did not show resistance to first\u2010line treatments ceftazidime, carbapenems and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. As a result of this study, the authors have advocated the preservation of fluoroquinolones as they are not warranted as first\u2010line therapy, and they are also used to treat TB, which importantly is endemic in this region.39 This highlights the importance of continued surveillance of regional resistance patterns and revision of therapeutic guidelines.",

The disease is seen mainly in South Asia, Southeast Asia and the South Pacific Islands. Three species of filarial nematodes cause TPE: Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi and Brugia timori.72, 73 Mosquitoes transmit the disease and humans are the definitive hosts. Microfilariae trapped in the lungs lead to an immune hyper\u2010responsiveness, leading to symptoms of cough, fever, night sweats, wheezing and weight loss. Pulmonary radiology can appear miliary or nodular, mimicking TB.73 However, imaging can be normal in up to 20% of patients.73 Spirometry tends to demonstrate a restrictive pattern with airways obstruction, and airway obstruction is usually reversed by bronchodilators. Treatment with diethylcarbamazine is associated with rapid improvement in signs and symptoms, as well as a gradual trend towards normal in spirometric values, although permanent impairment in lung function can occur.74\n",

It is transmitted to humans by the bite of the female Anopheles mosquito, and falciparum malariae is the most severe of all malarial infections. The symptoms leading to a suspicion of malarial infection are fever which can be cyclical, breathing difficulties and anaemia. Once the disease is suspected, light microscopy is the standard tool used to detect parasites on blood smears. Rapid diagnostic tests utilize antigen detection technology as an alternative when reliable light microscopy is unavailable, and the WHO is recommending its use as a field alternative when rapid diagnosis is paramount.79 There is a wide range of pulmonary manifestations, from a non\u2010productive cough to ARDS, occurring in up to 25% of adults with severe falciparum malaria infection although any strain of Plasmodium can lead to ARDS.80 The development of ARDS portends an extremely grave prognosis81, 82\u2014Gachot et al. described a 33% mortality rate in patients with malaria and acute lung injury despite admission to an intensive care unit.82 Chest roentgenogram findings are non\u2010specific and can range from confluent nodules to basal and/or bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, mimicking pulmonary oedema, although this is usually non\u2010cardiogenic.83 Resistance to antimalarial drugs especially chloroquine and sulfadoxine\u2010pyrimethamine has become widespread. WHO now recommends artemisinin\u2010based combination therapy (ACT) as the first\u2010line treatment in uncomplicated falciparum malaria. For uncomplicated, non\u2010falciparum malaria in regions with low choroquine resistance, chloroquine can be used.84\n",
