PACT encounters defaulted to 10 minutes/patient and GC encounters to 8 minutes/patient with no extra time scheduled between patients. The medical team then had the option to flex up or down the duration of time allotted per patient before posting the final schedule. On rounds, an audible cue signaled when 2 minutes remained in a patient\u2019s allotted time. If the team finished an encounter early, they used the extra time between patients for order entry or teaching. We implemented a standard plan to get back on schedule in the case of delays: if the team was behind >4 minutes, the team skipped the next patient and resumed SBFCR with the following patient. The skipped patient was rounded on later during built-in buffer time (16 min between PACT and GC patients) or at the end of scheduled patients.",

Phase I began July 13, 2015, with the implementation of all the SBFCR components during the workweek. The 14-month intervention was continued to September 30, 2016. We communicated adherence to SBFCR with a visibility board updated by case management and nursing leaders. Nurses who missed rounding encounters were interviewed to understand barriers to full participation. Weekly feedback sessions with the improvement team and rounding team were held to facilitate subsequent Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles. By September 2015, on request from RNs, SBFCR expanded to include weekends (PDSA 1). Consistently, RNs assigned to patients with ventricular-assist devices accompanied them to hospital school at 9:00 am, thus missing later rounds. In December 2015, the case manager adjusted the schedule before finalizing it to move these patients before 9:00 am (PDSA 2), and family prephase II surveys were collected. Phase II began January 2016 with patient/family notification of rounding window (\u00b1 15 min of the specific scheduled time) and educating families about SBFCR (Family education brochure describing SBFCR. See Supplemental Digital Content 2, http://links.lww.com/PQ9/A164). In February 2016, we implemented a daily huddle before rounds to review the schedule and anticipated admissions (PDSA 3). We conducted postimplementation surveys for providers during March 2016, and for families in June 2016. After 14 months, following completion of data collection, the scheduling algorithm was adapted into an electronic health record tool to help automate the schedule creation (for an example of SBFCR schedule as created in EPIC web tool, see Supplemental Digital Content 3, http://links.lww.com/PQ9/A165). Once published, anyone can access the schedule from within the electronic health record. This intervention has facilitated sustainability by streamlining the scheduling process, enabling the spread of SBFCR to other acute care services.",

RN attendance and participation, family member presence, FCR checklist items (pain management discussion, central line and telemetry monitoring needs, and target discharge date), and deviations between expected and actual rounding time were tracked for every patient. P-charts were made to track our primary aim with average weekly % nurse attendance (Fig. 2) and % nurse participation (Fig. 3).12 We examined in detail one random week per month to assess the team\u2019s compliance with keeping SBFCR patient order and timeliness and how these features affected RN and family participation. Additionally, nursing management tracked RN attendance daily on the unit\u2019s visibility board with notes on obstacles to rounds participation.

Aragona et al.15 postulated that improved coordination of patient rounding time and other nurse responsibilities would likely improve nurse attendance, and scheduling rounds was an organizational strategy identified to improve family engagement in FCR. SBFCR offers a method to achieve this coordination. In our study, keeping the order of patients was associated with increased RN attendance and participation, but starting earlier or later than the set time was not associated with fluctuations in these metrics. The nurses worked closely with the case manager to be aware of when the team was running ahead or behind the set schedule. This awareness helps explain the maintenance of high attendance despite the 47% of encounters starting >5 minutes earlier or later than the scheduled time.",

Although the average rounding time/patient increased by 1 minute, it was value-added time because the checklist items were reliably discussed. Additionally, providers perceived less time spent between patients waiting for the nurse or interpreter, so rounds felt more efficient. The time invested in rounds may decrease clarifications from RNs or families afterward, which likely contributed to perceived efficiency.5 Similar standardization approaches to rounds have shown to significantly increase both healthcare provider\u2019s satisfaction and quality of discussion during rounds.16 We also found SBFCR improved overall satisfaction with rounds for providers. High engagement and satisfaction with the rounding process, which is a major component of the inpatient workday, can have a positive effect on patient outcomes while decreasing provider burnout.17",

Second, as this was a project done in phases, concurrent improvement initiatives, the Hawthorne effect, or unrecognized trends could impart biases. Third, the audit data collected by the case manager during rounds were not independently verified and did not capture between rounding wait time or any weekend data. Last, although we conducted surveys of providers and nurses before and after SBFCR, we did not use a validated tool to assess nurse-physician collaboration.20 Not all trainees had experienced cardiology rounds before and after SBFCR, limiting the comparison concerning the perception of teaching. The RN survey did not directly solicit feedback on overall satisfaction with the SBFCR process and focused on the perceived benefits of attending rounds.",
