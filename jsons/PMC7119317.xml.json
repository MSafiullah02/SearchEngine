The incidence of specific pathogens varied in accordance with the completeness of testing and specificity of diagnostic criteria (ie, definite vs presumptive diagnosis [table 1]). Collectively, S pneumoniae was the most frequently isolated organism, with the highest incidence of this pathogen reported in studies that included detection by a urinary antigen test.28, 29 Relative to other pathogens, M pneumoniae, C pneumoniae, and Lpneumophila were also common. These organisms (along with other Chlamydia spp and C burnetii) are often referred to as \u201catypicals\u201d, a label of contended scientific merit. Nevertheless, the term remains popular with clinicians and is in widespread use in recent scientific reports.31 These atypical pathogens are not often identified in clinical practice, however, because (with the exception of L pneumophila) there is not a specific, rapid, or standardised test for their detection; as such, the frequency of these pathogens is probably under-reported.31\n",

Their results showed that use of these tests increased the proportion of cases of CAP for which a cause could be established to 83%, from 50% reported when conventional tests\u2014ie, sputum and blood cultures and serological tests\u2014were used. Their results also changed the ranking of pathogens established by conventional testing from M pneumoniae (35%), C pneumoniae (17%), S pneumoniae (17%) to S pneumoniae (30%), M pneumoniae (22%), C pneumoniae (13%).26 Importantly, S pneumoniae represented one third of all causes not documented by conventional testing.",

This decision about whether or not a patient should be admitted might have an effect on the extent of diagnostic testing as well as the choice of empirical antimicrobial treament.

This process has been validated as a method for identifying patients at risk of death, which is low for risk classes I III (0-1-2-8%), intermediate for class IV (8\u00b72\u20139\u00b73%), and high for class V (27\u201331%). It is also an effective method for triaging patients and, in particular, for identifying low-risk patients who can be safely treated as outpatients.49, 50, 51, 52 Subsequent recommendations by the pneumonia PORT are that, before calculation of the severity of index score, patients should first be assessed for any pre-existing condition that might compromise the safety of home care, including haemodynamic instability, active co-existing conditions that would necessitate admission, acute hypoxaemia, social or psychiatric problems compromising home care, or the inability to take oral medication.53\n",

Patients who have none of the features listed are at low risk of death and do not usually require inpatient care, whereas those who display two or more core adverse prognostic features should be admitted. A scoring method based on this British Thoracic Society assessment has been developed; this system was assessed with use of a compilation of data from three prospective studies of CAP done in the UK, New Zealand, and the Netherlands.54 A six point score (one point for any of confusion, urea >7 mmol/L, respiratory rate >30, low blood pressure, and age >65 years) enabled patients to be stratified in accordance with risk of death (score 0=0\u00b77% increase in risk of death; 1=2\u00b71%; 2=9\u00b72%; 3=14\u00b75%; \u2a7e4=40%). This simple scoring system can be used to stratify patients with CAP into different groups for management purposes.",

About 11 % of patients with CAP will have positive blood cultures, more commonly associated with severe illness.6 Although the usefulness of blood cultures for all patients admitted to hospital is questioned,61, 62, 63 investigators in one study64 noted that if results of blood cultures were obtained within 24 h of admission, survival rates were improved. The yield of clinically useful information is greater if the culture specimen is collected before antibiotics are administered.62 The value of routinely doing a sputum gram stain and culture has long been debated.6, 7, 8, 9, 15, 57, 58, 65 These tests are limited by the fact that many patients cannot produce a good specimen, patients often receive antimicrobial agents before assessment, and many specimens yield inconclusive results. The validity of the gram stain is related directly to the experience of the interpreter. Indeed, some discrepant findings about the sputum gram stain are presumably explained by the quality of specimens and technical expertise; and when stringent criteria are applied, although the sensitivity drops, the specificity for pneumococcal pneumonia can approach 90%.65 Sputum culture for other pathogens (ie, Legionella spp, fungi, viruses, Mycobacterium spp) should be considered to identify unusual pathogens or notifiable diseases. However, because the early administration of treatment is important for the outcome of CAP, an attempt to obtain expectorated sputum should never delay the prompt start of antimicrobial treatment.",

An assay approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for pneumococcal urinary antigen has been assessed in several studies.68, 69, 70, 71 The sensitivity in defining invasive pneumococcal disease in adults is 60\u201390% with a specificity close to 100%. In one of the largest published studies to date, Gutierrez and colleagues71 used this assay on concentrated urine samples obtained from 452 adults with CAP. Pneumococcal antigen was detected in 19 (70%) of 27 patients with proven pneumococcal pneumonia. Of the 269 patients who had pneumonia with no pathogen identified, antigen was detected in 69 (26%), which suggests that an important proportion of cases that are presently undiagnosed by standard tests can be identified with this assay. However, 16 (10%) of 156 samples from patients with pneumonia caused by other agents were positive, indicating potential problems with specificity.",

Most erm-resistant isolates have an MIC greater than 32 \u03bcg/mL for erythromycin and are thought to be highly resistant to all macrolides and clindamycin. Until recently, reports of failure of CAP treated with macrolides have been rare, particularly for patients at low risk of drug-resistant strains. However, since 2000, anecdotal reports and one controlled study have documented failures attributable to macrolide-resistant S pneumoniae in patients treated with an oral macrolide who have subsequently required admission with S pneumoniae bacteraemia.101, 102, 103, 104 Currently, mef-associated resistance predominates in North America. erm-associated resistance predominates in Europe and is common in Japan.105\n",

Other agents effective against drug-resistant S pneumoniae include quinupristin/dalfopristin, linezolid, and the ketolides.

Results of additional retrospective studies suggest that the benefit of combination therapy that includes a macrolide applies not only to CAP in general but also to CAP specifically associated with S pneumoniae bacteraemia.117, 118 The possible coexistence of atypical pathogens or the immunomodulating effect of the macrolides might, in part, be responsible for this finding. However, interpretation of these studies is subject to limitations inherent in their retrospective study design; and, since they only assessed empirical treatment, the findings are not necessarily applicable for pathogen-directed treatment that usually is started 24\u201348 h after initial therapy.119\n",

The rationale is that the macrolides provide effective therapy for the most common bacterial pathogens for such patients, primarily S pneumoniae (that has, until now, been mostly responsive to macrolide in North America) as well as the atypical organisms (especially M pneumoniae and C pneumoniae, which are common in outpatients). The positioning of the macrolides as prominent first-line agents in the North American guidelines is partly based on the presumption that the newer macrolides (azithromycin or clarithromycin) can be effective against macrolide-resistant S pneumoniae strains in which lower-level resistance results from increased drug efflux with resulting MIC often less than 8 \u03bcg/mL. However, because recent data indicate that mef-mediated resistance is becoming associated with higher MICs (from a median of 4 \u03bcg/mL to 8 \u03bcg/mL), it is reasonable to consider alternative treatment (ie, \u201crespiratory fluoroquinolone\u201d, or high dose amoxicillin plus macrolide) if risk factors for drug-resistant Spneumoniae are present. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) statement emphasises that the fluoroquinolones should be reserved for cases associated with failure, or allergy to other agents, or documented drug-resistant S pneumoniae.5 The rationale is that widespread use would lead to the development of fluoroquinolone resistance in the respiratory pathogens (as well as other pathogens colonising the treated patients).",

These indicators were: use of pneumococcal and influenza vaccines (for prevention of CAP); administration of antimicrobials in a timely matter (within 8 h of arrival at the hospital); advice to cease smoking for patients who smoke; drainage of a pleural empyema; conversion from parenteral to oral antimicrobial treatment when the patient is improving, haemodynamically stable, and able to take oral medications; and use of appropriate discharge criteria (ensuring that patients are clinically stable at the time of release from hospital).127 Whereas the studies reviewed by Rhew supported 8 h as the target time for appropriate initiation of antimicrobial agents, more recent data have shown that starting therapy within 4 h was associated with better outcomes for patients who needed to be admitted.128 Although one study of CAP patients who were admitted to academic medical centers did not show a benefit of many of these indicators, implementation of a pneumonia practice guideline that promote some or all of these quality indicators has been shown in many other studies to be associated with better outcomes (including a reduced risk of death).129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134\n",

An important advance has been the development and licensure of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in infants which not only reduces serious pneumococcal infections in children but also the colonisation of vaccine strains.140,141 Although the benefits of this vaccine have yet to be directly proven in clinical trials in adults, its use in children has been shown to reduce the rate of pneumococcal disease in adults.140 This reduction is probably due to decreased transmission of pneumococci from children; and thus could provide an effective method for reducing disease caused by drug-resistant strains.",
