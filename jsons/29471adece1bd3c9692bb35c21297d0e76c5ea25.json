            "text": "67 courses that have been ongoing for longer than 1 yr can be 68 safely terminated for high-risk NMIBC patients. Although 69 the European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines [5] 70 recommend 3-weekly instillations at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 71 36 mo on the basis of European Organization for Research 72 and Treatment of Cancer data [6], the optimal schedule for 73 maintenance BCG remains unclear. Among high-risk NMIBC 74 patients, maintenance BCG reduces the rates of recurrence 75 and progression by approximately 15% and 4%, respectively 76 [4,7]. 77 3. Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 78 Any patient with a suspicion of COVID-19 should be tested. 79 In the presence of confirmed COVID-19, a cautionary 80 approach would be to delay instillation of BCG given that 81 there are no data on tolerance of intravesical BCG among 82 COVID-19 patients. The median age (70 yr) and high 83 comorbidity status of patients diagnosed with NMIBC 84 increase their risk of developing a very severe form of 85 COVID-19 [2]. This could be associated with both more 86 adverse side effects of BCG and/or more severe forms of 87 COVID-19. On the basis of the previously described natural 88 history of COVID-19 [2], it is advisable to delay BCG 89 instillation for at least 3 wk after initial symptoms to allow 90 for complete recovery. 91 4. BCG vaccination and COVID-19 92 Recent theories suggest that use of BCG as a vaccination 93 could prevent COVID-19. This is based on the epidemiologi-94 cal observation that older patients are at higher risk of 95 COVID-19, especially severe forms, while younger patients 96 could be protected by BCG vaccination providing childhood 97 immunity that may last for approximately 20 yr [8]. In 98 addition, preclinical studies in mice have shown that BCG 99 vaccination could offer protection against various DNA and 100 RNA viruses via induction of innate immune memory and 101 heterologous lymphocyte activation [9]. Two randomized 102 controlled trials are currently testing BCG vaccination for 103 COVID-19 prevention in Australia (NCT04327206) and the 104 Netherlands (NCT04328441). Arguably, intravesical instilla-105 tions of BCG for induction of a local immune response with 106 activation of macrophages, neutrophils, and natural killer T 107 lymphocytes [10] could help in preventing and/or control-108 ling COVID-19, but this is only a hypothesis that cannot 109 currently be used for clinical decision-making. Only post-110 crisis retrospective analyses of COVID-19 incidence among 111 NMIBC patients treated with intravesical instillations of 112 BCG during the pandemic will provide interesting insights 113 into this view. 114 5. Management of BCG side effects 115 In managing side effects related to intravesical BCG 116 instillations, careful attention should be paid to persistent 117 fever by isolating and testing patients for COVID-19.",
