Infection of the reproductive tract with IBV signifi cantly diminishes egg production, causing substantial losses in the egg-production industry each year [ 63 ]. More recently, a novel coronavirus named SW1 has been identifi ed in a deceased Beluga whale [ 64 ] . Large numbers of virus particles were identifi ed in the liver of the deceased whale with respiratory disease and acute liver failure. Although, electron microscopic images were not suffi cient to identify the virus as a coronavirus, sequencing of the liver tissue clearly identifi ed the virus as a coronavirus. It was subsequently determined to be a \u03b3-coronavirus based on phylogenetic analysis but it has not yet been verifi ed experimentally that this virus is actually a causative agent of disease in whales. In addition, there has been intense interest in identifying novel bat CoVs, since these are the likely ancestors for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and hundreds of novel bat coronaviruses have been identifi ed over the past decade [ 65 ]. Finally, another novel family of nidoviruses, Mesoniviridae , has been recently identifi ed as the fi rst nidoviruses to exclusively infect insect hosts [ 66 , 67 ] . These viruses are highly divergent from other nidoviruses but are most closely related to the roniviruses. In size, they are ~20 kb, falling in between large and small nidoviruses. Interestingly, these viruses do not encode for an endoribonuclease, which is present in all other nidoviruses. These attributes suggest these viruses are the prototype of a new nidovirus family and may be a missing link in the transition from small to large nidoviruses.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 135, "end": 141, "text": "[ 63 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 506, "end": 512, "text": "[ 64 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1413, "end": 1424, "text": "[ 66 , 67 ]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Animal Coronaviruses"}, {"text": "The most heavily studied animal coronavirus is murine hepatitis virus (MHV), which causes a variety of outcomes in mice, including respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurologic infections.

Interestingly, MHV-3 induces cellular injury through the activation of the coagulation cascade [ 68 ] . Most notably, A59 and attenuated versions of JHMV cause a chronic demyelinating disease that bears similarities to multiple sclerosis (MS), making MHV infection one of the best models for this debilitating human disease. Early studies suggested that demyelination was dependent on viral replication in oligodendrocytes in the brain and spinal cord [ 69 , 70 ] ; however, more recent reports clearly demonstrate that the disease is immune-mediated. Irradiated mice or immunodefi cient (lacking T and B cells) mice do not develop demyelination, but addition of virus-specifi c T cells restores the development of demyelination [ 71 , 72 ] . Additionally, demyelination is accompanied by a large infl ux of macrophages and microglia that can phagocytose infected myelin [ 73 ] , although it is unknown what the signals are that direct immune cells to destroy myelin. Finally, MHV can be studied under BSL2 laboratory conditions, unlike SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, which require a BSL3 laboratory, and provides a large number of suitable animal models.

HCoV-NL63 is also associated with acute laryngotracheitis (croup) [ 79 ] . One interesting aspect of these viruses is their differences in tolerance to genetic variability. HCoV-229E isolates from around the world have only minimal sequence divergence [ 80 ] , while HCoV-OC43 isolates from the same location but isolated in different years show signifi cant genetic variability [ 81 ] . This likely explains the inability of HCoV-229E to cross the species barrier to infect mice while HCoV-OC43 and the closely related bovine coronavirus, BCoV, are capable of infecting mice and several ruminant species.
