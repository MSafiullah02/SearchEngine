            "text": "Febrile illness is one of the most common causes of consultations especially in developing countries [1] . A large range of infectious agents may be involved but clinical presentations are often non-specific, hence compromising the validity of diagnosis made with only clinical features [2] . The recent widespread use of rapid diagnosis tests (RDTs) for the diagnostic of malaria infection combined with malaria control interventions lead to a decreasing proportion of confirmed malaria illnesses [3] . Clinical management guidelines for febrile illnesses have been developed but are often syndrome-based [4] and clinical diagnosis can rarely be confirmed as clinical laboratory services are markedly lacking in low-income settings [5] . Clinicians frequently encounter non-malarial febrile cases with few paraclinical options to diagnose and treat patients. Several studies in Eastern Africa [6] [7] [8] [9] and Asia [10, 11] highlighted the importance of non-malarial infections such as bacterial zoonoses or arboviral infections, which could be prevented and correctly treated if biologically confirmed. Madagascar is a large island located in the South-Western part of the Indian Ocean that presents different bioclimates and a broad spectrum of malaria transmission. Fever cases are under surveillance since 2007 with the implementation by the Ministry of Public Health (MoH) and the Institut Pasteur de Madagascar (IPM) of a Fever Sentinel Surveillance Network (FSSN) composed of 34 primary health care centers throughout the country [12, 13] . This network aims at closely monitoring the following epidemic-prone diseases: malaria, influenzalike illnesses (ILI), Dengue-like Syndromes (DLS) and diarrheal syndromes. From 2008 to 2011, this surveillance reveled that fever is responsible for 11.1% of total outpatients; Among recorded febrile cases, malaria accounted for 12.0%, ILI for 20.7%, DLS for 8.7% and diarrheal diseases for 4.7% [14] . However, only malaria is laboratory confirmed using RDTs following national policies.",

Sites were randomly selected among the 34 sites encompassed in the FSSN. One mobile team from IPM composed of a clinician and a laboratory technician visited all sites during predefined periods between April 2014 and September 2015. We used historical data from the FSSN database to estimate the duration of investigation in each site to reach the number of inclusions. Time of investigation for each site was determined according to various criteria such as availability of the local doctor and team, accessibility of the site and availability of liquid nitrogen. As the objective of our study is to provide a national description of causes of febrile illnesses in a countrywide sentinel network, an overall sample size of 685 consenting patients was deemed adequate to have sufficient precision for prevalent diseases and to detect infrequent pathogens. Hence, the amount of sentinel sites led to a convenience sampling of at least 30 and up to 40 febrile patients per site. A standardized clinical examination was performed and all consenting patients with fever were included and sampled regardless of clinical status.",

The methods previously described [26] combined conventional multiplex PCR with hybridization of biotinylated PCR products to streptavidin labeled probes on a macroarray chip (Chipron GmBH), followed by colorimetric detection. Briefly, each specimen is subjected to 2 multiplex PCR reactions containing biotinylated primers targeted to the 30 pathogens. Subsequently, the PCR products are denatured and hybridized to the chip surface which is coated with target probes directed against each of the 30 pathogens. A positive reaction is detected by addition of streptavidin-conjugated enzyme and substrate, resulting in the development of a color precipitate.",

            "text": "Our study aimed at identifying pathogens associated to febrile illnesses in Madagascar. To our knowledge, few studies on etiologies of fever have targeted outpatients' febrile diseases etiologies widely in a country [10, 11] , as most focused on severe illnesses and/or children [6, 28, 29] . Due to non-specificity of some infections and the varieties of pathogens that may circulate concomitantly in tropical countries like Madagascar, laboratory confirmation is needed to estimate the prevalence of each of the pathogens associated to febrile illnesses in the community. We detected at least one pathogen in almost half of the febrile outpatients attending our 21 sentinel sites throughout the country. In this study, ILI was the leading cause of consultation, which is in line with our laboratory results as respiratory viruses were the predominant pathogens detected. Due to financial constraints, we only tested four of these viruses that were found as the most prevalent in previous studies [23, 30] . Thus, our detection rate (20.2%) may represent an underestimate in light that other common respiratory viruses such as parainfluenza viruses, human metapneumovirus and coronaviruses might have been detected. This result is consistent with other studies [8, 10] where proportions of respiratory viruses detected in nasopharyngeal swabs varied between 11% and 20% and where acute respiratory infections were the major cause of healthcare seeking behavior. In our study, two thirds of patients were under 15 years of age thus explaining the high prevalence of acute respiratory infections [31, 32] . Malaria was the second etiology detected followed by viral infection detected in the blood. One patient tested positive for HIV and had a clinical presentation of low grade fever, asthenia, mild cough, lymphadenopathy and leucorrhea. This patient previously tested positive for HIV but had been lost to follow-up on treatment. This situation highlights the need to strengthen screening, care, treatment and follow-up of HIV infections in Madagascar, despite the low prevalence of the infection in the country compared to neighboring African countries [33] . We found a prevalence of active Tuberculosis (TB) infection of 0.6% which is higher that estimated prevalence of tuberculosis in Madagascar (237 per 100 000 populations per year in 2016) [34] . This could emphasize the underestimation of TB diagnosis in health care centers. In addition, TB in children is often missed due to non-specific symptoms and difficulties in diagnosis, thus our results might also underestimate the number of TB cases since we were only able to test patients with productive cough and able to produce sputum. We used predominantly molecular assays to detect pathogens in specimens, allowing high sensitivity of detection although carriage may not necessarily be related to the clinical event [35] . A comparison group of healthy individuals would have allowed us to describe the background level of carriage in the asymptomatic population and estimate the probability that a detected pathogen is truly responsible of the illness. To detect potential multiple infections, we performed the same analyses on all patients regardless of their clinical status. We are aware that this approach cannot be used in an operational manner, but some infrequent pathogens would have been missed if tests had been guided by clinical characteristics. Thus, it allows us to obtain a deeper profile of febrile-associated pathogens. But more importantly, our study allowed us to detect one case of infection with Leptospira spp. To our knowledge, this is the first leptospirosis laboratory-confirmed case detected in Madagascar, in Maroantsetra, a city located in a per humid area of the eastern coast. To date, all studies regarding leptospirosis in Madagascar are related to its reservoir or based on serological surveys [15, 17] . Only three cases of human leptospirosis infection have already been described since 1955 and only one case of molecular confirmation has been described in La R\u00e9union in a patient with an history of travel to Madagascar [15, 36] . As described in previous leptospirosis case reports, this patient presented a suspicion of cholecystitis [37, 38] . Interestingly, no bacterial zoonoses diseases like Q fever or rickettsiosis described in other studies to be largely incriminated in fever cases [6, 39] were detected, nor arboviral infections. None of the 13.9% of Dengue-like Syndromes were confirmed with dengue virus or other common arboviruses tested, although investigation by IgM ELISA may detect cases that have passed the viremic phase otherwise missed by molecular tests. This emphasizes the low Positive Predictive Value of the DLS case definition when arboviruses (including dengue and chikungunya viruses) prevalence is low and probably its overall limited specificity. HBV was detected in the blood of six patients (0.9%) of which three were children below 5 years. Madagascar has a high-intermediate level of endemicity for HBV infection [40] . National immunization program introduced HBV vaccine in 2002 as part of the pentavalent vaccine after the age of six weeks. These results emphasize not only the need to improve vaccination coverage and prevention of mother to child transmission but also the necessity of scheduling a vaccine dose at birth to avoid perinatal infections. One case of infection with RVFV was detected in a child with initial mumps clinical diagnosis. Several RVFV epidemics occurred in Madagascar in past years [41, 42] but as far as we know, no human case was identified during inter-epidemic periods. Our recent data on malnutrition in children less than 5 years are in line with the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) survey 2012-2013, highlighting the need to continue and expand interventions in Madagascar to tackle these conditions. This study presents some limitations. Indeed, due to resource constraint, some specimens like urine and stools were not collected and we also did not perform hemoculture from blood specimen. Thus, some pathogens associated to sepsis, enteric and urinary tract infections were not investigated. Despite the high sensitivity and specificity of the assay used to detected blood stage infections (Venter et al. 2014) , some blood pathogens (such as Coxiella burnetii or rickettsial infections) are present at very low levels and nearly impossible to detect in whole blood. Blood cultures and antibodies tests must be used. This might partially explain the percentage of febrile patients with no pathogen detected. The cross-sectional design of our study did not allow assessment of temporal variation of pathogens circulation within the country or a specific area. Given the seasonal pattern of some pathogens (respiratory viruses, malaria, other vector borne diseases) and the design of our study (we visited each site once in a year), we have probably underestimated and/or overestimated some of these pathogens. This is the reason why a comparison of pathogens detected per region is not feasible. Moreover, we believe that the grouping of sites per region or bioclimatic area would not be applicable in this study design. Indeed, socio-economic factors or local transmission pattern of some infectious agents (i.e.: tuberculosis, malaria) would impose separate analysis. Further study should be considered to assess seasonality of fever cases and infectious agents, especially in Madagascar where various bioclimatic regions are encountered. Another limitation is due to the inclusion of mainly patients aged below 15 years overestimating pathogens prevalent in children. However, this age imbalance reflects the true demographics of patients attending health care in Madagascar, where socioeconomic status, travel distance to the facilities and care utilization largely influence healthcare-seeking behavior [43, 44] . Nevertheless, the results of our study draw an overview of most prevalent pathogens associated with fever in the country and provide relevant information for further investigations.",
