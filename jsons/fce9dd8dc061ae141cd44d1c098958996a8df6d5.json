The objectives of this study were to use data from a community surveillance study of respiratory viral infections and from hospitalizations from the same geographic area to: (a) characterize RSV in a community cohort (including non-medically attended cases) and hospitalized patients, (b) describe the clinical features and resource utilization of RSV, and (c) examine seasonal trends. 9 Households in this study were primarily multigenerational, Latino and publicly insured.

In addition, findings from the hospital group likely reflect referral center bias; however, patterns were similar when assessing just those from the catchment-area. Also, due to EMR limitations, we were unable to abstract accurate data on all types of respiratory-support, calculate percent positive by age or analyze the results of chest X-rays in the hospitalized group. In addition, by narrowing our selectivity to RSV-positive RVP within \u00b1 2 days of admission and collecting data on resource utilization with \u00b1 2 days of positive RVP, we may have underestimated the true burden of RSV among hospitalized patients.
