This was formerly known as the adult respiratory distress syndrome,1, 2, 3 a term introduced to emphasise its similarity to that seen in premature babies suffering from the effects of deficient pulmonary surfactant production, i.e. the infantile respiratory distress syndrome (see p. 43), but following the recognition that the causes of the adult respiratory distress syndrome may also operate in children, \u2018adult\u2019 has given way to \u2018acute\u2019. The causes of the syndrome differ markedly in infants and adults but whatever the cause, a common cycle of events is initiated (Fig. 4.1\n) so that the end-result is the same regardless of the cause. It is a common condition, which carries a high mortality, about 50% overall. Estimations of incidence show considerable international variability but one American study reported it to be 79 per 100 000 population.4\n",

There is generalised ground-glass opacification of the lungs, which is most pronounced in the dependent parts of the lungs. The opacification rapidly becomes increasingly dense until there is frank consolidation (Fig. 4.2\n).6 Air is then confined to the bronchi, which therefore appear black on plain radiographs where they stand out against the alveolar \u2018white-out\u2019 (so-called air bronchograms).7\n",

The principal cells of the air\u2013blood barrier, the type I alveolar epithelial cell and the capillary endothelial cell are exceptionally thin (see Fig. 1.27, p. 16) and this makes them particularly vulnerable to non-specific damage. Injury to these two cells underlies the development of DAD. At an early stage of alveolar injury the type I epithelial cells show cytoplasmic blebbing, which is soon followed by necrosis resulting in denudation of the basement membrane (see Fig. 7.2.5, p. 376).16, 17 Similar blebbing is seen in the alveolar capillary endothelium but denudation of the endothelial basement membrane is seldom observed, probably because of differences in the ways epithelial and endothelial cells regenerate (see below). The consequences of this damage include the escape of fibrin-rich exudates into the interstitial and air spaces, loss of the surface-active alveolar lining film and pulmonary collapse.",

The changes are often patchy, with the dorsal and basal regions being most severely affected (Fig. 4.3\n).18, 19, 20 Slicing shows that they are wet, the cut surface exuding blood or heavily blood-stained watery fluid. Microscopically there is widespread collapse, intense congestion of the capillaries, interstitial oedema and distension of the lymphatics, a pattern that is sometimes known as congestive atelectasis (Fig. 4.4\n). Alternatively, there may be haemorrhagic oedema (Fig. 4.5\n). At the air\u2013tissue interface, which in these collapsed lungs is at the respiratory bronchiole or alveolar duct level, respiratory movements compact a fibrin-rich exudate mixed with necrotic epithelial debris into a thin layer that covers an otherwise denuded epithelial basement membrane (Fig. 4.6\n), leading to the formation of hyaline membranes (Fig. 4.7\n)11, 12, 13, 21, 22: these are identical to those that paediatric pathologists recognise as the hallmark of the infantile respiratory distress syndrome (compare Fig. 4.3 with Fig. 2.8, p. 44).

Nevertheless, thrombosis may complicate such endothelial damage21, 32 and subsequent organisation of such thrombi is probably responsible for some of the vascular remodelling that is seen in the repair phase of DAD. This remodelling consists of fibrocellular intimal thickening that narrows the lumen of small vessels throughout the lung and can be visualised as decreased background filling on postmortem arteriograms.34\n",

Involvement of the alveolar ducts results in these structures being lined by a ring of granulation tissue (Fig. 4.16\n). Less frequently, the organised exudates retain a predominantly intra-alveolar position, resulting in loose buds of granulation tissue similar to those seen in organising pneumonia due to other causes (see Box 6.2.1, p. 309). However, here they are more widespread and there is more prominent type II cell hyperplasia, interstitial fibroblastic proliferation and interstitial inflammation (Fig. 4.17\n). Nevertheless, such an organising pneumonia pattern is worth recognising as it carries a better prognosis than interstitial fibrosis.50 It is claimed that this intra-alveolar pattern of repair is particularly found when generalised sepsis is the cause of the initial damage whereas interstitial fibrosis is more characteristic of injury caused by cytotoxic drugs and the idiopathic cases.51\n",

With small air cysts alternating with solid areas of fibrosis and foci of squamous metaplasia there is a resemblance to the bronchopulmonary dysplasia seen in the late stages of the infantile respiratory distress syndrome.55, 56 In survivors the granulation tissue undergoes progressive collagenisation and such patients may suffer from debilitating fibrotic lung disease. The pattern is then that of fibrotic non-specific interstitial pneumonia,58 making it important to determine whether there has been an episode of acute lung injury in such patients.",

            "text": "Tumour necrosis factor has been demonstrated on the luminal surface of pulmonary endothelium in endotoxin-induced shock.86 It causes vascular smooth muscle to relax but this action is reduced if the endothelium is removed,87 indicating that tumour necrosis factor-induced vasodilatation is partially dependent upon the integrity of the endothelium. A factor that causes vascular dilatation has been detected as coming from the vascular endothelium and acting on the medial muscle coat of the vessel. At first termed endothelium-derived relaxing factor, this factor is now known to be nitric oxide, a remarkably simple chemical that has long been recognised to be poisonous.88 Fortunately, its half-life in the vessel wall is very short, timed in seconds rather than minutes. The enzyme responsible for its production (from l-arginine) is nitric oxide synthase, which is found in endothelium and can be induced in the vascular medial smooth muscle. Both the constitutive and inducible forms of the enzyme are activated by bacterial lipopolysaccharide and it therefore seems likely that in septic shock bacterial products act directly on the vessel wall resulting in the production of excess amounts of nitric oxide. Even momentarily increased levels of nitric oxide might be expected to cause arterial dilatation and hence capillary congestion. It would appear that in septic shock circulating bacterial products such as lipopolysaccharide cause vascular dilatation and possibly increased permeability by direct action on the blood vessels and indirectly through the induction of nitric oxide synthase and the release of the cytokines mentioned in the preceding paragraph. Pulmonary endothelial upregulation is indicated by widespread expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1: CD54) in septic shock. Indeed, positive immunostaining for CD54 is proving to be a useful marker of shock.89\n",

In host defence nitric oxide plays a very different and more aggressive role. It enables macrophages to generate free oxygen radicals, the principal means by which these cells eliminate both bacteria and cancer cells, but which, if not inactivated, also damage healthy host cells.90 Macrophages release much more nitric oxide than endothelial cells but, as in the blood vessels, the amounts released are generally inactivated within seconds. However, overwhelming bacterial infections result in the release of very large amounts of nitric oxide and the overproduction of toxic oxygen radicals. Although the oxygen radicals are countered by the protective action of enzymes such as superoxide dismutase,91 their excessive release results in oxidation of lipids and protein sulphydryl groups, and DNA damage.92 Damaged cell membrane phospholipids release free arachidonic acid which in turn is degraded to produce leukotrienes, such as prostaglandins and thromboxane, that are capable of altering vessel calibre and permeability.",

Indeed, this is occasionally attempted by a process of extracorporeal oxygenation in which the systemic blood is diverted through an artificial lung in the form of a membrane oxygenator that sits alongside the patient.143a, 143b, 143c This is a major procedure that generally occupies a surgical operating theatre and is often attended by problems with haemostasis and, if prolonged, haemolysis. Lesser procedures involve the insertion of an intravenous oxygenator or the use of an extracorporeal device that removes carbon dioxide from the blood passing through a cannula connecting a femoral artery to its vein, but these only treat a fraction of the blood leaving the heart.",

            "text": "More often, blood oxygenation is maintained by artificial ventilation, sacrificing the optimal conditions for lung recovery in favour of supplying other organs, particularly the brain, with oxygen. Simply allowing the mechanically expanded lung to collapse again several times a minute would establish a pattern of respiration quite unlike the normal and one that would incur further damage to the lungs. With a normal lining of surfactant the alveoli do not collapse completely at the end of expiration. A considerable residual volume of gas is normally retained but, when the alveolar lining film is lost, as in DAD, the alveoli collapse completely at the end of each respiratory excursion and the inspiratory phase commences from a much lower baseline. It is now recognised that this exerts considerable mechanical stress upon the delicate alveolar epithelial lining,144 the integrity of which is already severely compromised in ARDS. These purely mechanical forces result in the generation and release of a variety of injurious cytokines (e.g. tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1) and reactive oxygen species without necessarily involving any inflammation.145, 146 To minimise this, positive pressure is usually maintained throughout the respiratory cycle, a form of ventilation termed positive end-expiratory pressure, frequently referred to as PEEP.147 If, despite PEEP, hypoxaemia approaches dangerous levels the intensivist has no choice but to raise the concentration of oxygen in the inspired air, although it is recognised that high concentrations of oxygen are themselves injurious to the lung. With severe lung damage a situation is often reached where to prevent cerebral injury increasingly higher concentrations of oxygen have to be employed. The initial damage to the lung is then compounded by a combination of mechanical and chemical injury, resulting in an aggravated form of DAD to which the term \u2018respirator lung\u2019 is often applied.",

This obliterative pattern of fibrosis is the result of severe lung injury due to any of the causes of DAD considered above. Intra-alveolar and obliterative pulmonary fibrosis have many causes in common. The pattern of fibrosis depends not so much on the nature of the damage as its severity. With very severe injury the alveolar lumen is flooded with a fibrin-rich exudate, organisation of which completely obliterates the air spaces over broad tracts of lung. Within these areas, however, the framework of the alveolar walls can often still be appreciated, particularly with elastin or basement membrane stains. It is as if the architecture has undergone a form of petrification. The parts of the lung affected by obliterative fibrosis are completely non-functioning. This pattern of fibrosis is unlikely to resolve.",

It is particularly notable that the \u2018exudate and transudate\u2019 group of diseases predominantly affects the basal portion of the lungs and the \u2018granulomatous\u2019 group more the upper parts. The reason for this is not well understood but it can be a helpful diagnostic pointer in advanced disease. It requires no great skill in interpreting chest radiographs to assign a patient with widespread reticulonodular opacities to one or other of these two broad groups on the basis of the distribution of the disease. This criterion is also useful when assessing widespread pulmonary fibrosis postmortem.Box 4.4Causes of predominantly interstitial pulmonary fibrosis\n\nThe conditions in the left-hand column are ranked on a time scale from organising diffuse alveolar damage, which may progress to fibrosis within 10 days, to asbestosis, which evolves over many years.",

These causes may also lead to an obliterative pattern of pulmonary fibrosis (see above) but in the present context, instead of exudates flooding alveoli, they line the denuded alveolar walls as hyaline membranes, organisation of which leads to their incorporation into the alveolar interstitium (see Figure 4.12, Figure 4.13). This augments the activity of interstitial fibroblasts, the two processes combining to cause fibrosis of the alveolar walls. A similar process, albeit at a slower tempo, is envisaged in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (usual interstitial pneumonia), which is dealt with in Chapter 6.1. Most of these conditions entail damage to the delicate lining cells of the alveoli and capillaries with consequent exudation. It is perhaps because of this that the subsequent interstitial fibrosis is most marked in the dependent parts of the lungs. This distribution is also seen in the interstitial fibrosis that follows long-standing interstitial oedema in conditions such as mitral stenosis and pulmonary veno-occlusive disease.",
