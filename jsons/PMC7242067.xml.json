It is taught in several undergraduate and graduate courses in formal methods, including graduate courses taught by some of the authors at University of Minho (UM) and University of Porto (UP), in Portugal. One of the reasons for this popularity is the support for automated analysis provided by the Alloy Analyzer, an easy to download and install self-contained executable written in Java. The Analyzer also allows instances (either witness scenarios or counter-examples) to be graphically depicted using user-customized themes, a popular feature both for experienced users and students. Alloy is very effective in the specification and analysis of the static structures that pervade software design, but requires the employment of well-established idioms, that introduce an explicit notion of state or time, if mutability is to be considered and temporal properties analyzed. To avoid this cumbersome and error-prone process, several extensions to Alloy have been proposed, including one by authors of this paper \u2013 Electrum [7] \u2013 which extends the Alloy language with variable structures and linear temporal logic (including past operators), also adding bounded and unbounded model checking engines to the Analyzer.",

The second is the absence of some automated assessment functionality or online judge system for students to independently check the correctness of their exercise resolutions.

Over the last two years, Alloy4Fun has been used in 3 editions of graduate courses on formal methods and a tutorial at an international venue, which has allowed us to quickly obtain insight on how students use the language, namely identify typical mistakes or learning breakdowns in the class.",

After accessing alloy4fun.inesctec.pt (the URL where Alloy4Fun is currently deployed) the user gets an empty online editor (with syntax highlighting) where Alloy models can be written. An Alloy model consists of a sequence of paragraphs: each paragraph is either a signature (and the respective fields) declaration, a fact with a constraint that is assumed to hold, an assertion with a constraint to be checked, or an auxiliary predicate or function definition. Signatures introduce sets of elements (known in Alloy as atoms) and fields establish relations of arbitrary arity between those sets. Disjoint subset signatures can be declared by extension, and the parent signature can be marked as abstract, if it should only contain atoms present in its extensions. For example, the Alloy4Fun screen capture shown in Fig. 1 shows a model of an online Curriculum Vitae (CV) platform, an example that was used as an exercise in classes. This model declares a signature\n\nthat is partitioned in two subsets,\n\nand\n\n. Two more signatures are declared in this example:\n\nand\n\n. We also have several fields that relate atoms of these signatures. For example,\n\nis a binary relation that associates each atom of\n\nwith its set of\n\ns. Signature and field declarations can have multiplicities attached to impose cardinality constraints. For example, the\n\nin the declaration of field\n\nimposes that each\n\nshould have at least one\n\n.",

All the analysis commands operate in a bounded domain: there is a user-defined scope imposed on every signature that limits the maximum number of elements that will be considered by the automatic verification procedures. In Alloy4Fun the topmost right button allows analysis commands to be executed: the command to be executed can be selected in the drop-down immediately above.

When compared to the Analyzer, Alloy4Fun follows a more lightweight approach to the user interface, allowing the most common theme customizations (like changing the color of the atoms of a given signature) to be performed quickly through a right-click menu on atoms or edges. We also stripped down a bit theme features to a subset that we identified as those more commonly used. Alloy4Fun themes allow color, shape, stroke, and visibility parametrization for signatures and fields, signature projection, and the display of fields as attributes inside atoms. Among the unsupported features we have, for example, the customization of the atom labels for each signature or the ability to hide only unconnected atoms of a particular signature. A new feature is the ability to select different layout algorithms to automatically organize nodes, which the user can then manually move. Unlike in the Analyzer, atom positions are preserved between the frames of projected instances, and when navigating the different states of a trace in the case of an Electrum (mutable) instance. In Fig. 1 a counter-example of a\n\ncommand named\n\nis being depicted with a user-defined theme. Unlike in the Analyzer, besides navigating to the next instance the user can also re-visit previously presented instances. In the case of Electrum, Alloy4Fun only allows one state of an instance trace to be visualised at a time (the Electrum Analyzer depicts two states side by side), and it is only possible to ask for a different next trace (the Electrum Analyzer has more sophisticated trace exploration options, for example it is possible to ask for trace with the same prefix up to the displayed state, but a different next state).",

The standard Alloy Analyzer provides limited support for model and instance sharing: they can be saved in separate files, which can then be shared using external tools (email, online repositories, etc), to be again opened at the destination for inspection or editing. When a visualization theme has been developed to ease the interpretation of instances, it must also be shared in an additional file. This sharing by saving/opening files rapidly becomes tedious and time consuming in some contexts, in particular for tutors of large classes that interact frequently with students (typically by email) to clarify doubts. Alloy4Fun provides the ability to easily share models and instances. After pressing the \u201cshare model\u201d button a permalink is generated, that can later be used to access the model. Any theme defined by the user is also preserved when sharing, thus allowing instances of shared models to be depicted as intended by their creators. Concrete instances can also be shared via permalinks. The theme and positions of the depicted atoms and relations at the time of sharing are also preserved. This is a very handy feature since, likewise in the Analyzer, the positioning of atoms by the automatic layout mechanism is often not ideal, requiring manually rearrangement for better comprehension. For instance, the instance presented in Fig. 1 can be shared as depicted3.",

Although the Alloy specification language has very neat and simple syntax and semantics, many students struggle with its declarative nature, in particular those used to procedural programming [2]. One way to overcome this difficulty is by independently solving exercises proposed by tutors, but, even with automated analysis and visual feedback, it is often difficult for students to assess whether they reached the correct answer, and tutors are required to inspect and interpret the solutions (something not scalable for large classes). These problems could be mitigated with automatic assessment functionalities, allowing students to solve exercises at their own pace and without the constant need for face-to-face time with tutors. In recent years, auto-graders and online judges have become widely popular for learning how to program [10], and we believe this success could be replicated in the learning of formal methods in general, and Alloy in particular.",

Using a comment instead of a new keyword to mark secret paragraphs ensures compatibility with Alloy\u2019s default syntax, allowing users to copy and paste models from Alloy4Fun to the standalone Analyzer, and vice versa. Section 3.1 will describe how this feature can be used to create simple specification exercises in the form of duels, where the user/student tries to reach a secret specification.

A possible way to gain insight about the students\u2019 learning process is to have access to their attempts at solving the proposed exercises, and tool support to mine this corpus for useful data [8]. Again, such feature would also be useful for research, and was one of the reasons that led Microsoft to develop the www.rise4fun.com web service, that allows researchers to easily deploy their tools on the web and collect human-tool interactions for posterior mining [1] (besides other advantages of web tools, like increased exposure, since the need for downloading and installing is eliminated, and promoting reliability given the large amount of test cases that can be collected). One of the most popular examples available via Rise4Fun, and the inspiration for developing Alloy4Fun, is www.pex4fun.com, a web-based educational gaming environment for learning programming, where students can engage in coding duels where they attempt to write code equivalent to a tutor\u2019s secret implementation [12]. Pex [11], an advanced white box test-generation tool, is used on the background to find inputs that show discrepancies between the student\u2019s code and the secret implementation. However, the interaction with the outcome of the tools has limitations in Rise4Fun, which would prevent the implementation of key Alloy features such as instance iteration and customization. This has led us to implement our own solution rather than integrate Alloy in this service.",

Moreover, for each model, the identifier of the model from which it derives and a time-stamp are also stored. This means that all the models that are developed after accessing a shared permalink end up forming a derivation tree. In the case of a permalink with secrets/challenges, a branch in this tree typically corresponds to an interactive session where one user/student is trying to solve the different challenges defined inside, and can be analyzed to determine, for example, how many challenges were solved or how many attempts were needed to solve each one. Every fork in branch represents a point where a user generated a new permalink for a model which was subsequently accessed multiple times. Alloy4Fun allows anyone in possession of the secret permalink of a model to download the respective derivation tree in an easy to process JSON format.",

Thus, Alloy4Fun was only used in 4 lab sessions, each introducing a particular set of exercises \u2013 1 session with Trash FOL and Classroom FOL after the FOL lecture, 2 sessions with Trash RL, Classroom RL and Graphs after the RL lecture, and 1 session with Trash LTL after the LTL lecture. Extra exercises (namely LTS, Production, and CV) were made available in the course website for the students to freely explore. Moreover, all exercises were kept available throughout the semester so that students could independently practice outside of the classes.

To answer these question we used two methods: an anonymous questionnaire and analysis of the data collected by Alloy4Fun. The questionnaire was answered by 13 of the 17 students, and, over the duration of the course, we collected almost 11000 interactions with the exercises, most of them resulting from the execution of commands (checking the correctness of challenges) and a small portion from sharing of models6.",

Of these, 9 mentioned that when studying for the exam they actually repeated some of the exercises they had already solved before. The data collected throughout the semester, shown in Fig. 3, seems to corroborate these answers. Figure 3a depicts the usage of the platform over time, highlighting the classes where Alloy4Fun was mandatory and the evaluation points (first the project deadline, and later in the semester the two exams). Each entry in the dataset is either a correct (unsatisfiable) check, a wrong (satisfiable) check, an analysis that threw an error (e.g., parsing) or a model stored for sharing.

This information is normalised taking into account the number of challenges in each exercise (i.e., the graph shows the average number of executions per challenge). This chart provides some evidence that most of the students attempted to solve all exercises, including some of those not used in class.

Of course, some students might have multiple sessions recorded for each attempt to solve an exercise, since they might not solve all the challenges in a single continuous session and access the original shared permalink several times, instead of generating a new permalink of a partial resolution for later resuming the work. Overall we identified 430 sessions, with an average of 48 sessions per exercise. Even with all the uncertainty, it is safe to say that indeed most students should have used Alloy4Fun frequently outside the classes (from our observation, during classes students mainly used a single session per exercise), including repeated attempts to solve exercises already previously solved (as reported in the questionnaire): for example, for Trash FOL around 50 sessions were recorded where all the challenges were solved, a strong indicator that each student should have solved it at least twice.",

Contrary to our expectations, given that Alloy has special syntax for that purpose, challenges that required restricting the multiplicity of relations (F2) were only slightly easier than average (52%). As expected, the need to use nested quantifiers (F3) increases the difficulty of challenges (33% success rate). Concerning closures, usage of a closure operator over a relation (F5) was not very problematic (41% success rate), but challenges that required applying a closure operator to a relational expression (F6) were the most difficult to solve (8% success rate). We had some anecdotal evidence that closures were difficult for students, but this discrepancy between the two cases was rather surprising, meaning that special attention should be given to the later case in lectures. Other problematic concepts were the manipulation of ternary relations (F4) (19% success rate), and usage of the standard\n\nmodule (F7) (16% success rate), both frequently used in Alloy specifications. The first result is aligned with our anecdotal evidence, and we already had special care with higher arity relations in lectures. The second is a bit more surprising, meaning that, likewise to closures of relational expressions, we should invest more lecture time in explaining how to use this module. Concerning Electrum, students seem to understand well the usage of a single temporal operator (F8) (58% success rate), but, as expected and likewise quantifiers, specifications requiring nesting of several temporal operators (F9) were more difficult (32% success rate).",

Of the remaining, the most frequent are incorrectly applying logic operators to relational expressions and vice-versa (messages 3, 5, and 7), in total 28% of the errors, and simple typing errors related to arity (messages 4, 6, 9, and 10), in total 26% of the errors. The reader unacquainted with Alloy could find the frequency of the former rather surprising, but this is a rather frequent error due to the syntactic similarity between some logical and relational operators (for example,\n\nfor negation vs.\n\nfor emptiness check or\n\nfor conjunction vs.\n\nfor intersection). Fortunately, Alloy has alternative syntax for many logic operators (for example,\n\nfor conjunction) and maybe instructors should recommend using that alternative instead. Concerning warnings, all but the third most common message (unused variables, 23% of the total warnings) are warnings about potentially irrelevant expressions \u2013 formulas that are trivially true or false or expressions that always denote an empty set \u2013 a testimony to the usefulness of Alloy\u2019s sophisticated type system [5].\n\n",
