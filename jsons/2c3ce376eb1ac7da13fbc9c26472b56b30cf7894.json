General data are lacking regarding the spectrum of illnesses and the frequency of presentations to general practitioners by Australian returned travellers, but it is estimated that up to one in five travellers seek medical consultation from a general practitioner after returning from abroad. Many ill returned travellers will need to be referred for a specialist opinion, although the urgency of referral varies according to the diagnoses being considered. The most common infections in returned travellers affect the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts, followed by cutaneous and sexually transmitted infections.

However, It is also important to remember that the frequency of acquiring certain illnesses during a trip may not correspond to the frequency of presentation with those illnesses following return. For example, data on diarrhoeal illness among studies that evaluate illness occurring during travel show a predominance of bacterial causes of diarrhoea. However, among patients seen after travel, diarrhoea caused by parasites predominates. This is because, if the symptoms persist on return, they are usually more chronic in nature, and chronic diarrhoea is usually caused by different organisms than acute bouts of travellers' diarrhoea that have resolved spontaneously.
