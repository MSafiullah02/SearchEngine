            "text": "Cathepsins B and L belong to a family of 11 cysteine proteases (cathepsins B, C, H, F, K, L, O, S, V, W, and X/Z) with major roles in terminal protein degradation within the lysosome. Specific protein processing functions in other cellular compartments have more recently been recognized for the widely expressed cathepsins B and L. These include regulation of cell cycle progression through proteolytic processing of the CDP/Cux transcription factor in the nucleus [1], major histocompatibility complex class II antigen presentation [2] and control of growth factor recycling in endosomes [3], and hormone production within the regulated secretory pathway [4], [5], [6]. Notably, cathepsin L has been shown to convert proenkephalin to the active enkephalin opioid peptide neurotransmitter within secretory vesicles of neuroendocrine chromaffin cells [5]. Cathepsin B has been proposed to act as a \u03b2-secretase producing neurotoxic A\u03b2\n[7]. However, it was just shown that cathepsin B also degrades preformed extracellular oligomeric and fibrillar amyloid in aged APP transgenic mice [8]. Furthermore, cathepsin B was identified as the major enzyme responsible for endosomal proteolysis of internalized epidermal growth factor receptor complexes [9] and insulin-like growth factor-I [10]. Multistep endosomal proteolysis involving cathepsins B and L is also required for Ebola virus [11] and SARS-coronavirus infection [12].",

Secreted procathepsin L generates the angiogenesis inhibitor endostatin from collagen XVIII after conversion to mature cathepsin L in the acidic extracellular milieu of murine hemangioendothelioma cells [13]. In a mouse model of pancreatic islet cell carcinogenesis, impaired tumor invasion in cathepsin B\u2212/\u2212 mice and cathepsin L\u2212/\u2212 mice was in part attributed to maintenance of E-cadherin protein levels. It was subsequently demonstrated that both cathepsins release the extracellular domain of E-cadherin in vitro which abrogates its adhesive function [14]. Both single knockout mice also showed a reduction of tumor cell proliferation and increased cell death. The latter could be correlated with observed defects in tumor angiogenesis only in cathepsin B\u2212/\u2212 mice. Thus, apoptosis occurred independently of angiogenesis defects in cathepsin L\u2212/\u2212 mice [14].",

            "text": "The role of cathepsins in apoptosis appears to be complex. Cathepsin B has been reported to be an essential downstream mediator during tumor cell apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF-\u03b1) [15]. This lysosomal pathway of apoptosis requires the release of lysosomal enzymes into the cytoplasm (reviewed in [16]) and can be inhibited by suppression of cytosolic cathepsin B activity [17]. Furthermore, increased proteolysis by cathepsin B contributes to neuronal apoptosis in cystatin B-deficient mice, a murine model of Unverricht\u2013Lundborg progressive myoclonus epilepsy [18]. However, the biological relevance of the reported in vitro cleavage of the proapoptotic BCl-2 family member Bid by cathepsins [19] has been questioned in vivo\n[20], and further cytosolic target proteins of cathepsin B are not known. In contrast to the observed increased resistance of cathepsin B\u2212/\u2212 cells to TNF-\u03b1-triggered apoptosis [15], cathepsin L-deficient lung carcinoma cells showed increased sensitivity to apoptosis [21] which is in agreement with increased tumor cell death in the mouse model of multistage pancreatic tumorigenesis after deletion of cathepsin L [14]. Increased apoptosis in the absence of cathepsin L could be rescued by inhibition of the aspartic protease cathepsin D whose single-chain isoform was subsequently shown to be specifically degraded by cathepsin L. Therefore, it was proposed that cathepsin L contributes to control death receptor-induced apoptosis via proteolysis of cathepsin D [21].",

Most double mutant animals die during the weaning period even if they are carefully nursed. Procathepsin D and correctly processed mature cathepsin D were found to be increased in cathepsin B\u2212/\u2212L\u2212/\u2212 brain lysates [22] which potentially adds to the terminal apoptotic process. However, prior to neuronal cell death, cathepsin B\u2212/\u2212L\u2212/\u2212 neurons develop a lysosomal storage disorder reminiscent of human neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses [22], [23]. This suggests that cathepsins B and L have other essential roles during postnatal maturation and in maintaining the integrity of the central nervous system. In addition, cathepsin D deficiency or dysfunction itself causes a congenital form of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses in mice [24], sheep [25] and humans [26], [27].",

Importantly, the phenotype is restricted to select neurons in the cerebral and cerebellar cortex. In order to identify common neuronal substrates of cathepsins B and L, we performed a subcellular proteomics approach combining subcellular fractionation and amine-specific isobaric tag-based protein quantification by LC-MS/MS. Here, we present 19 proteins which are significantly increased in cathepsin B\u2212/\u2212L\u2212/\u2212 brain lysosomes. Our results imply that cathepsins B and L are involved in biosynthetic and recycling processes during early postnatal brain development.",

Direct comparison of the distribution profile of \u03b2-hexosaminidase activity between wild-type and B\u2212/\u2212/L\u2212/\u2212 fractions revealed an obvious shift towards heavier lysosomes in B\u2212/\u2212/L\u2212/\u2212 brains (Fig. 3A). A similar difference in the profile of the endosomal\u2013lysosomal compartment was observed upon SDS-PAGE and western blot analyses of all wild-type and double knockout fractions using an antibody against LAMP1 (Fig. 3B) and cathepsin D (Fig. 3C). Again, a prominent enrichment of late-stage lysosomes was found in double mutant mice. In contrast, the representative cytoskeletal marker TUJ1 only demonstrates a slight increase in heavy lysosomal fractions which may be explained by a general accumulation of proteins in cathepsin B and L-deficient lysosomes (Fig. 3D).",

For protein quantification only peptides that had been identified by more than one, manually verified spectrum were considered. Furthermore, only proteins that were increased by at least a factor of four were taken into account. Thereby, a total of 19 unique murine proteins, summarized in Table 2\n, were found to be increased in cathepsin B\u2212/\u2212/L\u2212/\u2212 lysosomes. These include five lysosomal enzymes: acid ceramidase-like protein, cathepsin D, hexosaminidase A and B, and palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1. In addition, the acidic glycoprotein prosaposine, a precursor of four activator proteins of various lysosomal enzymes was found to be increased. Two further proteins, ubiquitin B, and sequestosome 1, are part of ubiquitination-dependent degradation. Calcyon [29], apolipoprotein E [30], [31], Rab14 [32], phospholipase D [33], carboxypeptidase E [34], and the Delta/Notch-like epidermal growth factor-related receptor (DNER) [35] have been found in secretory and recycling pathways. Thus, most of the proteins presented in Table 2 have been associated with biosynthetic, endocytic, and lysosomal compartments. Moreover, the majority of the proteins identified are known to be expressed in neurons and to have important functions in neuronal development and/or maintenance of neuronal integrity (see Discussion). The iTRAQ results are in agreement with the increase of hexosaminidase A activity (Fig. 3A) and cathepsin D (Fig. 3C) in lysosomal fractions as well as of palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 activity in cathepsin B\u2212/\u2212/L\u2212/\u2212 brain lysates [22]. Exemplary tandem mass (MS/MS) spectra of Rab14, calcyon, carboxypeptidase E, and Delta/Notch-like epidermal growth factor-related receptor (DNER) are illustrated in Fig. 5\n. These proteins were more than 10-fold increased in cathepsin B\u2212/\u2212/L\u2212/\u2212 fractions.",

By electron microscopy, these structures were shown to correspond to expanded axons containing a large number of dense bodies (Fig. 1C, D) [22]. Immunohistological analyses demonstrated that only antibodies against Rab14 and DNER markedly stained these swollen axons (Fig. 6A, B). An antibody against cathepsin D labeled perikarya of many cell types throughout the cerebral grey and white matter, but not the pathologically swollen axons in cathepsin B\u2212/\u2212/L\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 6C). Cathepsin D staining of perikarya was more pronounced in cathepsin B\u2212/\u2212/L\u2212/\u2212 brains (data not shown). Rab14 and DNER were also increased in perikarya of select B\u2212/\u2212/L\u2212/\u2212 cortical neurons (data not shown). Thus, immunohistological analyses of Rab14 and DNER for whom functional antibodies were available do not only show a gradual quantitative, but a qualitative difference.",

Comparable strategies have recently been employed successfully for similar analyses directed towards e.g. lysosomal membranes or neuromelanine granules [32], [36], [37]. Although such a proteomics-approach cannot guarantee completeness of the obtained dataset, it has added valuable information for deeper insight into lysosomal function. Notably, the current study focused on the analysis of accumulating neuron-specific proteins in lysosomal storage bodies of murine brains deficient in the two proteases cathepsin B and L. Decreased proteins were not further analyzed since the reduction of any protein in double-deficient brains would rather reflect a general disturbance of metabolism by the advanced pathological process than a specific downregulation.",

Elevated levels of lysosomal enzymes have been found in other diseases with impaired lysosomal function such as the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses. This has been interpreted as a compensatory mechanism [38] which is supported by the observation that palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 and tripeptidyl-peptidase 1 activities were normal in 12-day-old and elevated only in older cathepsin B\u2212/\u2212/L\u2212/\u2212 brain lysates in response to disease progression (Table 1) [22].

            "text": "Rab14, carboxypeptidase E, calcyon, and the Delta/Notch-like epidermal growth factor-related receptor (DNER) are the most prominently increased proteins in cathepsin B\u2212/\u2212/L\u2212/\u2212 cerebral lysosomal fractions when compared to the corresponding wildtype fractions (Table 2). Rab14 [48] and carboxypeptidase E [34] are two proteins with predominant expression in brain and roles in neuropeptide biosynthesis, secretion, and recycling. Rab 14 is a member of the novel Rab2/4/14 subgroup which is thought to be involved in membrane trafficking between early endosomes and the Golgi cisternae [49]. Rab 4 regulates the recycling of receptors from early endosomes to recycling endosomes and the cell surface and is thus suggested to function at the level of the early sorting endosome [50]. The exact role for Rab14 remains unknown. GFP-Rab14 vesicles co-localized with early endosomal AP1 clathrin-coated vesicles but not with Rab 7 late endosomal vesicles or Lamp2- and Lysotracker-positive lysosomes [49]. A hallmark of the cathepsin B\u2212/\u2212/L\u2212/\u2212 phenotype are densely packed axonal inclusions [22] (Fig. 1B; Table 1). Expanded axons specifically reacted with antibodies against Rab14 and DNER but not with an antibody against the lysosomal marker cathepsin D (Fig. 6). The neuron-specific transmembrane protein DNER is normally expressed in somatodentritic endosomal compartments of the developing central nervous system [35], promotes neuron\u2013glia interaction by activating Notch signalling [51], and is essential for cerebellar development [52]. Apart from singular cell somata, no DNER-staining was observed within white matter of wild type mice in agreement with the previously reported somatodendritic expression of DNER (data not shown). Only expanded axons of double mutant mice were DNER-positive. It could therefore be possible that Rab-14 and DNER-positive, but cathepsin D-negative endosomal compartments evade towards axons in cathepsin B\u2212/\u2212/L\u2212/\u2212 neurons which are overloaded with lysosomes due to defective protein turnover. The increase of Rab14-positive dense bodies could be a compensatory rescue mechanism to relieve the lysosomal compartment via release of vesicle content. While unique in location and dense packing in cathepsin B\u2212/\u2212/L\u2212/\u2212 mice, phenotypically similar axonal inclusions have been observed in human lysosomal diseases [53]. The role of Rab14 and DNER in these disorders remains to be shown.",

            "text": "Intriguingly, the occurrence of axonal swellings precedes lysosomal storage in neuronal perikarya [22] (Fig. 1B; Table 1). Cathepsin B\u2212/\u2212/L\u2212/\u2212 mice develop this neuronal phenotype during early postnatal development, a phase characterized by intensive synaptogenesis as well as extensive growth and degeneration [54]. It is therefore also conceivable that sorting/recycling of Rab14- and DNER-positive endosomal compartments could be impaired in double mutant mice. This would suggest two different disease-causing mechanisms for cathepsin B\u2212/\u2212/L\u2212/\u2212 neurodegeneration: lysosomal storage due to defective terminal degradation of proteins and (a) more specific pathomechanism(s). Thus far, nothing is known about calcyon expression and function in early postnatal development of the murine brain. Calcyon is a 24-kDa transmembrane protein predominantly expressed in brain and localized to vesicular compartments in neuronal cell bodies, dendrites, spines, and synaptic structures. Initially, calcyon was found to interact with the D1 dopamine receptor in pyramidal cells of the prefrontal cortex [55]. Later, the clathrin light chain was identified as a further interaction partner of calcyon which was found to be a stimulator of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in cortical neurons [29]. With our current approach, we have only analyzed the lysosomal compartment. It will be interesting to analyze whether cathepsins B and L influence calcyon-mediated synaptic plasticity, vesicle recycling or transport in postnatal neuronal development. The specific roles of Rab14, DNER, calcyon, and carboxypeptidase E in the secretory or endosomal compartments during early postnatal development of the central nervous system could be directly or indirectly regulated by degradation or processing through cathepsins B and L. Defective neuropeptide production, secretion, vesicle sorting or recycling could contribute to the accumulation of lysosomal and misrouting of endosomal compartments in cathepsin B\u2212/\u2212/L\u2212/\u2212 neurons.",
