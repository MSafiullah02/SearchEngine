            "text": "Human Parainfluenza viruses (HPIV) belong to the Paramyxovirus family and are important causes of respiratory tract infections in young children, elderly individuals, and the immunocompromised globally. Serologic evidence shows that most children over five years of age have been infected by HPIV [1]. There are four types of HPIV with HPIV-1 and 3 belonging to the Human respirovirus 1 and 3 species of the Respirovirus genus and HPIV-2 and 4 belonging to the Human rubulavirus 2 and 4 species of the Rubulavirus genus. HPIV-1 and 3 cause more illness than the other two types and are therefore more studied. These two types have been reported to have distinct clinical and epidemiologic features. HPIV-1 is the most common pathogen associated with croup while HPIV-3 ranks only behind respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV) as a cause of bronchiolitis and viral pneumonia among infants and young children [2\u20134]. In children less than 5 years of age it has been estimated that HPIV-1 causes 0.3\u20131.6 hospitalizations per 1000 children and HPIV-3 causes 0.5\u20132.6 hospitalizations per 1000 children in the United States [3\u20135]. Both HPIV-1 and 3 also cause serious lower respiratory tract disease and death in the immunocompromised and elderly. HPIV-1 infections have been epidemic in the fall of odd-numbered years since 1973 and HPIV-3 infections are usually widespread in the United States during late spring and summer [3,6]. HPIV infections do not confer complete protective immunity and individuals get recurrent infections throughout their life. No effective vaccine is yet available for these viruses and further studies are needed to better understand the disease burden of these viruses [2]. A better understanding of HPIV-1 and 3 genome diversity, evolution, and epidemiological features is key for the development of improved diagnostics tools, prevention strategies, and treatments for HPIV-1 and 3 infections. However, major progress in this field has been hampered in part by the limited amount of HPIV-1 and 3 whole genome sequence data available to the scientific community in public repositories. To contribute to filling this gap in knowledge, our study sought to carry out a large-scale whole genome sequencing and analysis of HPIV-1 and 3 strains collected from multiple countries and years. HPIV-1 and 3 samples were collected from Argentina, Australia, France, Mexico, South Africa, Switzerland, and the USA during the period 2003\u20132011 and genome sequenced using a combination of Sanger and Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies (Ion Torrent, Illumina, and 454 platforms). Here, we present the results of a comparative analysis of 40 HPIV-1 and 75 HPIV-3 novel genome sequences, in combination with additional HPIV sequences available in Genbank. Our findings provide further insights into HPIV1 and HPIV3 worldwide genome diversity and evolution.",

Upon further inspection of the reads for these samples it became clear that they were a mix of reads from more than one virus with the percentage of reads representing each virus varying greatly across the genome. A deep sequencing analysis on KF530247 and KF530229 showed the presence of a mix of major and minor variants at multiple positions across the genome with high confidence. We could not tease apart the major and minor variants from the samples and therefore, for samples KF530247 and KF530229 the consensus sequence represented just the major variant. The amount of minor variant at positions across the genome were as much as 48%. Sample KF530247 had sites with minor frequency variants above 10% at 26 positions and sample KF530229 had minor variants above 10% at 11 positions across the genome. There were many other sites in both genomes where the frequency of minor variants was less than 10%. The other three potential HPIV-3 recombinant genomes (FJ455842, MH678681, and EU326526) were published by other research groups and lacked the sequencing reads required to confirm they were true recombinants. The publishers of FJ455842 argued that this virus was an example of natural recombination in HPIV-3 [34]. However, the only evidence shown is from recombination prediction algorithms, and the putative breakpoint falls in the overlap region of two amplicons used for sequencing. In our experience recombination events like this are typically the result of two different viruses being amplified and sequenced. Appropriate evidence for the recombination event would be individual reads spanning the breakpoint showing sequence that matches one parent on each side.",

            "text": "Interestingly, our analysis revealed that all of the proteins of HPIV-3 harbored more variable sites than the equivalent proteins in the HPIV-1 virus (Fig 1). The increased percentage of variable sites may at least partially be due to there being four times more sequences for HPIV-3 allowing for a larger amount of the population\u2019s variation to be observed. From these plots it was clear that the P protein was the most variable in both HPIV-1 and 3. The P protein is important for RNA transcription and genome replication. A region (78\u2013320) of the P protein that was previously identified as not being necessary for RNA synthesis in Sendai virus (a close relative of HPIV-1) contained 66% of the variable positions in the HPIV-1 P protein, even though the 243 residues represent only 43% of the protein sequence [35]. This protein is not well conserved between HPIV-1 and 3 so it is not clear exactly how the functional regions line up position-wise, but a similar region in HPIV-3 contained 55% of the variable positions. Perhaps since this region is not critical for the primary functions of the protein it is more accommodating of mutations. Often the HN gene is selected as the target gene to analyze the evolution of HPIVs because of its relatively high variability [36,37]. Our results suggest that the P gene could also be useful as a molecular marker for evolutionary analyses and epidemiology research. The entropy analysis also highlights more conserved regions of the genome that could be useful for the development of robust diagnostics and potential vaccines.",

            "text": "We used the SLAC, FEL, MEME, and FUBAR algorithms on the Datamonkey webserver to identify potential positively selected sites for each of the coding regions in HPIV-1 and 3 (Table 1). The positively selected site at codon 5 of the HPIV-1 F CDS is a part of the hydrophobic signal peptide, which is important for insertion of the premature fusion peptide into the rough endoplasmic reticulum [38]. Later in the fusion maturation process the signal peptide is cleaved from the protein. Since the signal peptide is not present in the mature fusion protein or virus and therefore should not be exposed to the host immune response it is unclear what could be the potential source of the positive/diversifying selective pressure on this site. In HPIV-3, site 108 of the F protein was found to be under positive selection. This site is part of the cleavage sequence which has historically been described as amino acids 106\u2013109 with the motif R-T-K-R but in modern sequences is more commonly R-T-E-R (present in >95% of sequences). There are seven sequences that have a G at this position and one that has an R. It is interesting that there are positively charged (K and R), negatively charged (E), and neutral (G) amino acids at this position. R and E have previously been observed in this position and were found to have no effect on replication in tissue culture or the respiratory tract of rhesus monkeys [39]. Between HPIV-1 and 3 there were six sites predicted to be under positive selection in the P protein. All of these sites fall in the region we described above that is highly variably but has been shown to not be essential for the function of the protein in Sendai virus. The two sites under positive selection in the HPIV-3 HN protein appear to frequently switch between two functionally similar amino acids with site 58 being S or N and site 168 being K or R. Both sites require only a single nucleotide change to change between the two amino acids. Site 440 of the HPIV-3 N protein is a Q in most sequences, but in multiple independent instances has switched to an R. The MEME algorithm predicted that there were 21 codons across the genome affected by episodic selection for HPIV-1 and 14 codons for HPIV-3 (S3 Table).",

Evolutionary rates were not very different from CDS to CDS for either virus. The L gene had the lowest rate for each virus. The evolutionary rates were similar between the two viruses with HPIV-3 having a slightly lower rate overall despite having a slightly higher rate for four of the six CDS. Since these viruses have significantly different tissue tropism and epidemiology this could lead to different immunologic pressures and some differences in evolutionary rates between the two viruses. Previous studies have estimated evolutionary rates from whole genomes to be 7.61 \u00d7 10\u22124 for HPIV-1 and 4.2 \u00d7 10\u22124 for HPIV-3 and for complete HN gene sequences to be 1.12 \u00d7 10\u22124 to 1.4 \u00d7 10\u22123 for HPIV-1 and 8.39 \u00d7 10\u22124 for HPIV-3 [40\u201342]. The published rates are generally higher than those seen in this study, which may be due to differences in the selection of viruses used for the estimate. Regardless, the published rates are similar to those seen in this study and are typical of those seen for RNA viruses [43,44]. Another recent study found a very similar rate (3.12 \u00d7 10\u22124) for HPIV-3 when analyzing the concatenated coding regions from all genomes available in Genbank at the time [45]. Our data suggests that at least from an evolutionary rate standpoint standard vaccine approaches to HPIV-1 and 3 should be successful because the genetic and predicted antigenic change in each virus is slow enough to allow subsequent change to any vaccine with reasonable genetic monitoring of the virus population.",

Clade 1 was very distinct with sequences from the winter of 1997 from just Wisconsin, USA, and appeared to have died off before samples were collected for our study. Clade 2 included viruses collected from 2003\u20132009 from Australia, France, Mexico and USA; whereas, clade 3 included viruses collected from 2009\u20132015, mostly from USA, with a few sequences represented from France and South Africa. Clades 2 and 3 were found to co-circulate in the USA. However, the degree of clade co-circulation in other countries was difficult to assess due to low representation of samples from other countries. However, both clades were found in France and South Africa within one or two years of each other suggesting that co-circulation may be occurring in these regions. All viruses sequenced in this study from Mexico and Australia belonged to clade 2. Since these few sequences represented all the sequences available for these two countries, it is unclear if other clades co-circulate with clade 2 in these regions. Previous studies have found these same clades co-circulating in Croatia, Japan, USA, and Vietnam [36,40,41,46,47]. Combined, the results of these studies suggest that there may have only been two main clades of HPIV-1 circulating globally during the period included in this analysis.",

In this system HPIV-3 is divided into three clusters (A, B, and C), cluster C is divided into several sub-clusters (1, 2, 3, etc.), and then some of the sub-clusters are further divided into a 3rd level of classification called lineage (a, b, c, etc.). Since then some groups have split up the sub-clusters into slightly different lineages that do not completely agree between papers or added a fourth level of classification below lineage. We decided to use the more agreed upon clades mostly following what was established in Almajhdi 2015 [49]. Our MCMC analysis of 268 HPIV-3 genomes included two of the three clusters (B and C) (Fig 4). Cluster C was the largest and included viruses collected in Argentina, Brazil, China, France, Mexico, Netherlands, Peru, USA, South Africa, Thailand, United Kingdom, and Vietnam during the period 2004\u20132016. Our analysis included subclusters C1, C2, C3, and C5 with lineages C1a, C1b, C1c, C3a, and C3b. Subcluster C3 had the largest number of sequences with most of them belonging to lineage C3a. Cluster B was much smaller than cluster C with sequences mostly from Australia collected in 2007, one sequence from South Africa in 2007, and one recent 2016 sequence from USA. Previous studies with the HN gene have also identified a small number of sequences from cluster B in Canada and Japan [46,48,49]. Noteworthy, there were no cluster C representative sequences from Australia. Perhaps that indicates some geographical restriction of HPIV-3 transmission in and out of Australia. It would be interesting to see a larger sampling of HPIV-3 in this country over multiple years to further clarify this situation. In several countries multiple lineages of HPIV-3 were observed within the same country in a single season or year showing that multiple lineages can co-circulate. Co-circulation of multiple HPIV-3 lineages was also observed previously in a study in Croatia [46]. The co-circulation of multiple clades is not uncommon for viruses and has been observed in other paramyxoviruses like RSV subtypes A and B and human metapneumovirus with subtypes A1, A2, B1, and B2 [50,51].",

Our analysis showed that multiple genetically distinct clades of both HPIV-1 and 3 circulate on a global scale with HPIV-3 having a larger number of distinct subclades that co-circulate. It may be important to consider the multiple clades of these viruses when designing vaccines in order to confer broad cross-protection. We found that some geographically distinct clades may have existed, and some appear to have died out. We further showed that HPIV-1 and 3 are evolving at similar rates and identified genomic and proteomic sites that are under positive selection.

While this and other studies have significantly increased the number of genome sequences available for HPIV-1 and 3 in GenBank, the number of genomes available for these important viruses is still very limited. Influenza A, for example, has greater than 100-fold more sequences available and it is still difficult to predict the correct vaccine strain or more prevalent subtype for any given season. Therefore, considerably more sequencing effort is needed in paramyxoviruses to further improve our knowledge of their molecular epidemiology and genetics. More studies incorporating larger numbers of sequences from other geographic regions and years are critical.",
