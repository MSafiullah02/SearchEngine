A fraction of them, in particular older patients and those with chronic underlying conditions, may have worse outcomes, with a very severe pneumonia which may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or end-organ failure that may be associated with a cytokine storm syndrome. 2 Laboratory features associated with the development of ARDS and progression from ARDS to death included neutrophilia, coagulation dysfunction [e.g., higher lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and D-dimer]. 3 In a small retrospective study (21 cases) the most severe 11 cases more frequently showed markedly higher levels of interleukin (IL)-2R, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF\u03b1 with the absolute numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes being markedly lower. 4 Starting from the first preliminary experience on the apparent efficacy of tocilizumab in COVID-19 pneumonia, 5 many global multicenter trials are now ongoing to test anti-cytokine treatments in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia with cytokine storm syndrome features.",

The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate baseline laboratory and immunological features in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia and to explore such parameters in relationship to standard of care (SOC group) therapy versus anti-cytokine therapy, mainly tocilizumab, (TOCI group) that was mostly used either in ventilated patients in the ICU or non-invasively ventilated patients, mostly in the ward setting. Our single centre experience and approach showed that the milder hospitalized SOC group faired well as did cases with cytokine storm treated with tocilizumab outside of the ICU setting without ventilator support. Severe complications including protracted bacterial infections complicated tocilizumab in the ICU setting but not ward-based tocilizumab therapy.

More clearly, our data suggested that tocilizumab treatment in patients with cytokine storm features may be more effective outside of the ICU setting in non-ventilated patients. However, there were differences in the degree of inflammation between non-ventilated and ventilated patients treated with tocilizumab, so it cannot be inferred that use of tocilizumab prior to ICU admission is superior, given the generally milder inflammation in the former group. Also, serious superimposed bacterial infections were largely confined to the ICU. More worryingly, half the ICU ventilated patients treated with TOCI remain ventilated or have died with only half of this group showing meaningful clinical improvement so far.",

It is well known that NLR is a biomarker for poor outcome even in various cancers. 21 Our study supports this role of NLR as baseline biomarker for poor prognosis in COVID-19. Moreover, a new risk factor scoring system, which can identify patients with low risk of disease progression, includes the lymphocyte count among the selected variables. 22 Lymphocyte biology probably plays a great role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 disease. 4, 23, 24, 25 Since CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells are a crucial arm against infections, 26 our findings also indicated that the lymphopenia in the TOCI group may be relevant for the emergence of secondary infections. Given that, treatment with tocilizumab might favor the persistence of the virus and iatrogenic infections. Anakinra, which we used after failure of tocilizumab in two patients, may be safer and more flexible than repeating tocilizumab infusion in seriously ill patients.

Very recent data showed that low molecular weight heparin or unfractionated heparin at prophylactic doses are associated with a reduced short-term mortality in more severe COVID-19 patients, 28 and most of our patients, particularly, in ICU, were administered heparin which may have impacted on the overall outcome. Moreover, inflammatory diseases carry a higher risk of thrombosis, and this is clearly documented in chronic autoimmune diseases. 29 It remains to be seen whether the possible efficacy of anti-cytokine therapy may be even to mitigate against immunothrombosis. On the other hand, increased levels of LDH and CK may also reflect the level of the organ damage in a systemic disease, as occurs in the macrophage activation syndrome, 30 where a hypercoagulable state often complicates the course, and it may be the case for COVID-19. Thus, it is not surprisingly that LDH has been already noticed as biomarker of severity as long as neutrophils, in COVID-19. 3, 31 This study has several limitations. It is an explorative retrospective not powered study, with some missing data due to the emergency context in which it has been realized. This is not a randomized controlled trial, thus no conclusions on the efficacy and safety of treatment approach employed can be provided. Six patients were transferred from other hospitals so original baseline values from the first admission were unavailable. About 50% of the TOCI group were admitted to the ICU within 24 hours from admission, thus they already presented a more serious disease at the time of admission. In general, the follow-up was limited from the hospital admission to the discharge from our hospital, but the final long-term outcome was not the aim of this study. Finally, measurement of viral load was not available. Nevertheless, the cohort is monocentric and the whole cohort herein described showed very similar characteristics to those reported by Wang et al. 2 , thus supporting the robustness of this analysis, though preliminary.",

Patients' consents for using data for research purpose were obtained at the time of hospital admission. Ethical approval for the present retrospective observational study was given by \"Comitato Etico Unico Regionale (CEUR)\", with the following registration number: CEUR-2020-Os-102. Patients treated with tocilizumab were then enrolled into the observational part of the TOCIVID-19 Italian study (EudraCT: 2020-001110-38), a single arm, open-label trial on the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in COVID-19 pneumonia.",

We searched PubMed for research on covid-19 published after 3 January 2020 to April 18, by combining COVID-19 search terms (COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, novel corona) with methodological search terms (prognostic, prediction model, algorithm, score). Earlier reports suggest that patients with elevated inflammatory markers, including IL-6, and organ damage markers are at higher risk of more severe morbidity and mortality under covid-19. Our study showed that subjects with poor prognostic markers treated with TOCI fell into two groups; an ICU treated group and ward treated group. The ward treated group showed better responses and less infections. This group may be the best for evaluating the impact of anti-cytokine therapy in COVID-19 pneumonia with evidence of severe systemic inflammatory reactions.",

Our strategy provided evidence for some benefit of anti-cytokine therapy in severe COVID-19 especially when therapy is used prior to ventilation. The risk of serious infection, non-response or death is more than 50% for ventilated tocilizumab treated patients in ICU and is much lower if therapy given prior to ventilation. The study also confirmed that the known poor risk factors for COVID-19 infection were present in the TOCI treated rather than in the good prognosis standard of care group.",
