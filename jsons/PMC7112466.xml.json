It is well\nknown that the outbreak size becomes finite above the threshold\n\u03bbc.21\nHowever, as the value of \u03bb increases, the outbreak size continuously\nchanges from an infinitesimal fraction to a finite fraction in the SIR model,23 and thus, it is difficult to determine the\nvalue of \u03bb at which the outbreak size turns to be finite. To our knowledge,\nthere has no effective numerical method for identifying the SIR epidemic threshold in\nprevious studies. In this work, we perform extensive numerical simulations of the SIR model\non networks with finite size, and present a numerical identification method by analyzing the\npeak of the epidemic variability24,25\n(i.e., the maximal value of the epidemic variability) to identify the epidemic threshold.\nThe effectiveness of the numerical measure is checked on random regular networks (RRN),\nwhere the HMF theory is exact. To get a deep understanding of the validity of the numerical\nmethod, we investigate the distribution of outbreaks sizes near the epidemic threshold. The\nrobustness of the variability measure is confirmed by the analysis of cutoff hypothesis of\nthe outbreak size distribution. We further employ the variability measure to verify the\ntheoretical predictions on scale-free networks and real-world networks, where the results\nindicate that the HMF prediction agrees very well with the numerical threshold, except the\ncase that the networks are disassortative, in which the QMF prediction is relatively close\nto the numerical threshold.",

When \u03bb>\u03bbc,\nthe numerical distribution of outbreak sizes is bimodal with two peaks occurring at \u03c1=1/N\nand O(1), respectively. The probability of small outbreak sizes in theory\nis consistent with that obtained by numerical simulations, but the probability of large\noutbreak sizes that constitute a lump in the numerical scattergram cannot be obtained\ntheoretically. Based on the analysis of the cutoff hypothesis of the outbreak size\ndistribution, we found that the susceptibility measure can give a fairly effective SIR\nepidemic threshold when the lump is ignored. Since the variability measure reflects the\nheterogeneity of the outbreak size distribution, it is always effective in identifying the\nepidemic threshold, where the distribution of outbreak sizes has the very strong\nheterogeneity.",
