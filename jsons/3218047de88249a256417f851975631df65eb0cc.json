            "text": "The papers reviewed provide initial parameter estimates for the serial interval and/or the generation time for COVID-19. Most of the estimates were for the serial interval rather than the generation time because in real life infection times are rarely available, so generation times cannot be estimated. Instead, typically, the onset of symptoms is observed. The estimates for the mean of the serial interval ranged from 3.1 to 7.5 days. There are a number of reasons why the estimates are wide ranging. The interval between symptoms in an infectorinfectee pair will be strongly influenced by the level of social contact. This will vary widely between different countries and indeed within countries. The impact of mitigation measures is also likely to be a key factor. The implementation of control measures will reduce the opportunity for an infected individual to transmit the disease to a susceptible individual. Consequently, the serial interval is likely to decrease during the course of an epidemic. Zhao et al. [15] showed that the serial interval decreased by 6.2% per day (95% CI, 0.4\u221211.6%) from January 10 to February 2 in Hong Kong and Shenzhen. They attributed this to the strengthening of the public health control measures over time. Stratified results produced by Bi et al. [19] showed that if the infector was isolated less than 3 days after symptom onset, the average serial interval was 3.6 days, increasing to 8.1 days if the infector was isolated on the third day after symptom onset or later. Du et al. [9] pointed out that the time between successive cases contracts around the epidemic peak and that this may have influenced their estimates. On the other hand, in a study of the Po' municipality of Italy, Lavezzo et al. [11] estimated that the serial interval increased from 6.90 days before the implementation of comprehensive control measures to 10.12 days after the implementation of these measures. Possible reasons for this increase are not discussed in the paper.",

In particular, it is possible to make assumptions about when and where cases were likely infected that are more difficult when the pathogen is widespread. Furthermore, during these early phases, uninfected and asymptomatic contacts are often closely tracked, providing critical information on transmission and natural history.",

Du et al.[9] highlight the fact that if recall accuracy is impeded by time or trauma, case-patients might be more likely to attribute infection to recent encounters (short serial intervals) over past encounters (longer serial intervals). Therefore, it is likely that recall bias is present in all of the studies and it is not possible to distinguish the level of bias present in the different studies. \u2022 The number of pairs used to estimate the serial interval varied considerably. Only six pairs were used in the study by Li et al. [12] . In contrast, a total of 468 pairs were used in the study by Du et al.[9] and 689 pairs were studied by Ma et al. [25] . However, the value of increased sample size must be evaluated against the difficulty of ensuring accuracy of the infector infectee relationship as the sample size increases. Lavezzo et al. [11] indicate that 120 pairs were used in their study but there is a lack of clarity on how this number was obtained. \u2022 Cheng et al. [23] state that 12 pairs were used in their estimation of the serial interval. Figure 1 of their paper indicates that these included three cases with asymptomatic infection. It is not clear how these cases were handled in estimating the series interval. Moreover, pairs in which the exposure date of the infectee was earlier than the date of symptom onset of the infector were excluded from the study. \u2022 In the study by Zhang et al. [14] and in other studies, the serial interval was estimated from cases in household clusters. The authors make the point that estimations based on household clusters may be 20% shorter than the true value of the serial interval. \u2022 Zhao et al. [21] highlighted the possibility of right truncated selection bias, i.e. the possibility of infector-infectee pairs with longer SI being under-represented in the sample .

Britton and Scalia-Tomba [28] highlighted the fact that the difference in variance between the serial and generation time can lead to biased estimates of the reproduction number. More specifically, when the serial interval distribution has a larger variance than the generation time distribution, using the serial interval as a proxy for the generation time will lead to an underestimation of the basic reproduction number.

            "text": "Overall, the availability of parameter estimates and information on the serial interval and generation time of the COVID-19 virus is very valuable at such an early stage of the pandemic. However, the estimations are very dependent on the specific factors that applied at the time that the data was collected, including the level of social contact. Consequently, the estimates may not be entirely relevant to other environments. The serial interval estimate of 6.6 days (CI 0.7 -19.0) from the paper by Cereda et al. [10] is likely to be the most relevant to European countries. National estimates should be obtained as soon as possible. In light of the biases that could occur, the serial interval and or the generation time should be estimated from early cases and careful consideration should be given to the methodology that is used.",
