            "text": "s u m m a r y A 7-day reduction in duration of common colds was shown by Eby et al. in 1984 using 23 mg zinc gluconate throat lozenges. Over the following 25 years, 14 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials produced widely differing results with about one-half showing success and the remainder showing failure. Positively charged, ionic zinc (iZn), but not bound zinc, is strongly astringent, antirhinoviral, increases interferon-gamma (IFN-c) 10-fold, inhibits intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and inhibits the release of vasoactive ingredients from mast cell granules. Solution equilibrium chemistry analytical techniques showed lozenge iZn fraction varying from 0% to 100% of total lozenge zinc between trials, with zinc acetate (ZA) releasing 100% iZn, zinc gluconate (ZG) releasing 72% iZn and other zinc compounds releasing much less or none at physiologic pH 7.4. Since only iZn has in vitro benefits, iZn variations are hypothesized to have produced the widely varying clinical results. In support of the iZn hypothesis, lozenge iZn and total daily iZn in trials were found highly correlated with reductions in common cold durations with statistical significance for mean duration (P < 0.001) and median duration (P < 0.004), while total zinc (iZn plus bound) showed no correlation with changes in duration. Duration reductions (mean 0 days, median 0.43 days) for multi-ligand ZG and ZA lozenges differed significantly from duration reductions (mean 3.37 days, median 2.9 days) for single ligand ZA and ZG lozenges (P < 0.001) showing that additive ligands as flavor-masks damaged or eliminated efficacy. Five of 6 trials with lozenges whose zinc compositions had a first stability constant of 1.7 or less succeeded, while only 2 of 9 trials of lozenges with higher stability succeeded (P < 0.02). From the strong, multiple statistical relationships found, it is inferred that iZn is the active ingredient in zinc lozenges for colds, as it is in vitro against rhinoviruses, and that solution chemistry analytical techniques used at physiological pH are correct means for lozenge iZn analysis. Zinc lozenges slowly dissolving in the mouth over a 20-30 min period releasing adequate iZn (P18 mg) used each 2 h are hypothesized to shorten common colds by 6-7 days, which is a cure for the common cold. Due to inadequate lozenge iZn very few of more than 40 different brands of zinc lozenges on the US market are expected to have any effect on the duration or severity of common colds.",

Consequently, a vaccine-based cure for the common cold has been hindered by the large number of viruses that can cause a common cold. Non-influenza-related viral respiratory tract infections (common colds) are the most frequent reason for office visits by adults and children to general practice physicians, accounting for over one hundred million primary care visits and an economic impact of over $40 billion per year in the United States. Inappropriate prescription of antibiotics to treat viral common colds occurs in up to 60% of office visits. This results in unnec-essary costs, contributes to antibiotic resistance and exposure to severe antibiotic side effects especially when fluoroquinolones are used. There is a great public need for a safe and effective cure for common colds [1] , and zinc lozenges have been hypothesized to be the cure the common cold.",

Variables for these computations include metal and ligand stability constants, pH and pK values, concentrations and temperature. Absorption of useful iZn from throat lozenges is local -in the oral, throat and nasal tissues only -consequently the only pH that has meaning in treatment of colds is hypothesized to be physiologic pH 7.4. In these computations, temperature was held constant at 37\u00b0C and zinc concentration was held constant at 5 mmol iZn. Minor variations in these variables in the range used in these RCTs are not believed relevant. Very few common zinc compounds release substantial iZn at physiologic pH, and zinc chloride, sulfate, acetate and gluconate are the only known sources [23] .

In 1984 Eby et al. [21] first reported zinc gluconate (ZG) lozenges in a 65 patient RCT to be an effective treatment for common colds. One 23-mg zinc (16.56 mg iZn) lozenge or calcium lactate placebo was dissolved in the mouth every 2 wakeful hours after an initial double dose (9 doses per day after the first day loading dose at 12 doses). After 7 days of treatment, 86% of 37 zinc-treated subjects were asymptomatic, compared with only 46% of 28 placebo-treated subjects (P = 0.0005) producing statistically significant and meaningful benefits. Zinc lozenges shortened the median duration of colds by 4.8 days and their mean duration by 7 days. Patients in both groups had been ill an average of 1.6 days prior to admission. The groups were well balanced for 12 patient characteristics, and if dropouts and those that did not return reports were hypothetically considered as negative responders, the positive results remained statistically sound (P = 0.007). The ZG lozenges were unflavored 1-g compressed tablets which dissolved in 20-30 min in the mouth. They contained 23 mg of zinc as active ingredient or 50 mg of calcium lactate as inactive ingredient. Tablets were otherwise identical, including excipients of dicalcium phosphate, microcrystalline cellulose, sodium starch glycolate, magnesium stearate, and FD&C yellow No. 5 and blue No. 1 (aluminum lake).

Lozenges dissolved in the mouth in 20 min. Zinc reduced the daily mean clinical score (the severity average of a number of symptoms) from 8.2 in the placebo-treated group to 5.7 in the zinc-treated group, and the reduction was statistically significant on the second day after virus challenge (P = 0.05). The total mean clinical score (the sum of the mean clinical scores for each day) was reduced from 41.0 in the placebo-treated group to 27.2 in the zinctreated group (P = 0.05). Objective scores including mean nasal secretion weight (P = 0.05), and total tissue counts (P = 0.05) were also significantly reduced in the zinc group compared with placebo. The strongly anisette flavored 1-g wet granulated compressed lozenges were designed by Rinaldo Pellegrini, MD, Ph.D. of RBS Pharma-Milan in Milano, Italy. They had a fructose and methylcellulose tablet base with magnesium stearate lubricant, and they produced a strongly drying and astringent mouth-feel [16] .

This study in 77 patients used hardboiled 4.5 g sugar and corn syrup lozenges containing 23 mg zinc from gluconate, 90 mg citric acid (2% of lozenge weight) and lemon flavoring. The lozenges or a matched placebo were given eight times daily to treat laboratory-induced HRV-13 and -39 colds. The significance of the added citric acid was unknown until a 1988 article by solution chemist R. Bruce Martin, Ph.D., was published showing the absence of ionic zinc and presence of negatively charged zinc species at physiologic pH [27] . The lozenges were pleasant tasting, non-astringent, non-drying, and non-metallic in flavor and were essentially indistinguishable from placebo. The reaction product was tightly bound zinc citrate (0 mg iZn). The active lozenges appear to have lengthened the mean duration of colds by at least one day compared to placebo since tissue usage was 50% higher in the active group than the placebo group on day 7 of the trial. This formulation is the most common zinc lozenge formulation on the United States market and results in zinc lozenges that do not shorten common colds [37] .",

Cold duration was increased 4.4 days by strongly effervescent zinc acetate (ZA) 10-mg zinc lozenges used 6.4 times daily compared to placebo. A letter from the lozenge designer and manufacturer, Faulding LTD, Adelaide, South Australia, indicated that the lozenges contained zinc acetate plus tartaric acid and sodium bicarbonate (ZA-TB) sufficient to result in strong oral effervescence [16] . Zinc acetate dissociates in the presence of these added ingredients and forms several tightly bound reaction products including zinc carbonate, which is non-soluble and non-ionizable [38] and negatively charged zinc tartrate species (0 mg iZn) [39] . These zinc lozenges appear to have released sufficient negatively charged zinc species that they neutralized native iZn from mast cell granules of the infected nasal epithelium, resulting in significantly worsened cold symptoms. Gluconate binds iZn about 10 times less strongly than tartrate [27] . Minor ingredients included talc and magnesium stearate lubricants, color and flavor.",

Lozenges were given 6.9 times per day, with a mean reduction of cold duration of 3.1 days in all patients (4.0 vs. 7.1 days P < 0.0001), and 3.85 days in a subgroup of blinded patients (3.54 vs. 7.39 days; P < 0.0001). Severity of symptoms over the 10 days of the study was meaningfully and significantly reduced in the zinc-treated group (P < 0.0002). These 3.8-g hard boiled lozenges also contained sucrose, corn syrup and cherry oil, and were prepared using the open pot batch method with the active ingredient (anhydrous zinc acetate) added last. Blinding was adequate and adverse effects between the groups did not differ significantly. Activation of monocytes and macrophages was decreased by iZn, most likely due to antioxidant effect of iZn. Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) was significantly decreased with iZn compared to placebo (P < 0.04), probably due to decreased nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-jB) activation. They suggested that the decrease in plasma ICAM-1 levels due to iZn therapy decreased docking of the cold viruses on the surface of somatic cells. Human rhinoviruses must ''dock\" with ICAM-1 on the surface of somatic cells to produce infection [51] . Thus, iZn acts as an antirhinoviral agent by reducing ICAM-1 as well as being directly antiviral to rhinoviruses [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] and by increasing interferon-gamma [12, 13] .",

Consideration of the biophysics of the mouth-nose biologically closed electric circuit (BCEC) teaches a different view. The interior of the nose is positively charged electrically relative to the mouth (60-120 mV), and the nose repels positively charged substances including ionic zinc from nasal application [16] [17] [18] 24, 49] . This circuit is in addition to many other BCECs described by Nordenstr\u00f6m [54] , a member and chairman of the Nobel Assembly in Stockholm, Sweden. Had there not been a mouth-nose potential difference, intranasally applied iZn would likely have been shown effective in treating common colds as early as 1901 when intranasal ionizable zinc sulphocarbolate was reported as a treatment for nasal catarrh [55] . Franklin [56] in 1931 and Shields [57] in 1936 reversed this field using intranasal zinc ionization with ionic zinc being driven by an applied electrical voltage (3-5 mA) preventing allergies and common colds for a year with two 20-min zinc ionization office treatments. Wenner and Alexander in 1936 showed that the nasal mucosal tissues are temporarily damaged by zinc ionization [58] . To treat the nose with iZn for colds in the presence of this mouth-nose electrical flux is analogous to boarding a moving train at its destination.",

In 1987 Geist et al. [61] at the University of Virginia School of Medicine conducted an in vitro antirhinoviral test of a number of ionic zinc compounds. In that study, the antirhinoviral effects of iZn were overwhelmed by the presence in the culture medium of 30 mmol magnesium chloride (over 30 times physiologic concentration), the exact concentration shown 20 years previously to be optimally effective in increasing rhinoviral cellular release from 8 to 310-fold [62, 63] . Nine other antirhinovirus tests of ionic zinc compounds [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] did not include super-physiologic magnesium, and each showed strong antirhinovirus effects. Inclusion of magnesium in zinc lozenges (or placebos) for common colds would be expected \u00c0 based upon the above \u00c0 to greatly worsen common colds, worsen chronic rhinosinusitis and worsen herpes simplex-induced common colds. Hypothetically, throat lozenges containing ionizable magnesium might cause severe sequela including fatalities in rhinovirus-induced asthma, especially in children [64] . Swallowing magnesium dietary supplements would not cause these side effects since it would not increase intra-nasal or intra-lung magnesium concentration beyond normal physiological levels.",

To reach their negative conclusions about the efficacy of zinc lozenges against ''naturally acquired colds\", they ignored iZn active ingredient dose-response criteria. They omitted the highly authoritative British Medical Research Council Common Cold Unit positive trial [34] of ZG lozenges against induced HRV-2 colds, but included the negative report by Farr et al. [36] of ZG-C lozenges against induced HRV-13 and -39 colds demonstrating ''cherry picking\". They criticized our positive 1984 report [21] for failure to meet intent to treat analysis, yet our Discussion showed that if dropouts and those that did not return reports were hypothetically considered as negative responders, our positive results remained statistically sound (P = 0.007). They also criticized our 1984 report for failing to show similarity of groups at trial onset, ignoring our Table 1 ''Characteristics of study groups\" which showed successful randomization. They criticized all zinc lozenges for common cold trials for not having a demonstrable mechanism of action [the mandatory intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) inhibition function] prior to the publication of the 2008 Prasad et al. [11] data showing ICAM-1 inhibition by iZn, and they did not consider the biophysical properties of the nose and mouth. They relied upon the faulty Geist et al.

Korant, Ph.D. in their exhaustive 6-year study of the strong antiviral effects of iZn against nearly all rhinoviruses [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] and the confirming report by Merluzzi et al.

A 2008 cold-season market survey by this author of zinc lozenges found in national chain stores in Austin, Texas, USA, showed that none met the criteria of high iZn content and long dissolution times, and nearly all released zero iZn. Some zinc lozenges contained ZGG and from this analysis should slightly shorten colds (average of 1.8 days mean reduction), but their main benefit is hypothesized to be from a strong anti-histaminic action which would rapidly increase feeling of well-being. Most zinc lozenges also contained citric acid which slightly worsens colds (average of 1 day mean increase). Some zinc lozenges contained non-ionizable (at pH 7.4) zinc compounds including zinc oxide, aspartate, tartrate, picolinate, orotate and various amino acid chelates [74] , which are believed inefficacious against colds [24] . Choices of zinc compounds that do not release iZn at pH 7.4 are believed predicated on commercial desires to avoid the orally astringent and drying nature of iZn, thus a cure for the common cold is precluded by marketing forces, not science. A current assessment of more than 40 over-the-counter zinc lozenges is maintained on the Internet [37] . Zinc lozenges marketed in the United States appear to compete based upon taste rather than efficacy.",

Permeability of cell membranes is reduced by iZn, but cells remain viable. Ionized zinc hardens the cement substance of capillary epithelium, inhibits pathologic transcapillary movement of plasma protein and reduces local edema, inflammation, and exudation. Additionally, iZn reduces mucus and other secretions in tissues containing goblet cells and other secretory cells, causing affected areas to become drier and heal faster [75] .",

Usual dosage is suggested to be one or two 18 mg iZn lozenges per day for treatment of allergy. These benefits result from the strong astringent action of super-physiologic iZn on cell membranes, especially mast cell and basophil cell-plasma membranes [14] [15] [16] 76] resulting in temporary inhibition of all cellular and mast cell granule derived vasoactive agents including histamine, prostaglandins, leukotrienes, serotonin, bradykinins and cytokines. Although common cold symptoms are caused by viruses through bradykinins and cytokines, while allergy symptoms are caused by allergens through histamine and leukotrienes, concentrated iZn is beneficial in treating both conditions. These strong, natural, multiple anti-inflammatory effects help explain why iZn is beneficial in treating allergy [16] , asthma [77] , anaphylaxis [78] , bronchitis [79] and croup [80] . Zinc also is mandatory for Tcell lymphocyte cell mediated immunity [81] giving further support for its role in treating viral infections generally.",

Zinc lozenges must not contain ionizable magnesium since it can be expected to greatly worsen colds and exacerbate asthma, perhaps fatally. Of the 40 different brands of over-the-counter zinc lozenges and many variations of them currently available in the US, very few \u00c0 based upon this analysis and ingredients listed on their labels \u00c0 appear to release useful amounts of iZn regardless of total zinc content, and none of them can be considered as a cure for common colds.
