            "text": "PLA2 enzymes are a group of enzymes that hydrolyze the sn-2 position of phospholipids to yield fatty acids and lysophospholipids (Fig. 1A). More than one-third of the PLA2 enzymes belong to the sPLA2 family, which contains 10 catalytically active isoforms (IB, IIA, IIC, IID, IIE, IIF, III, V, X, and XIIA) and 1 inactive isoform (XIIB) in mammals (Dennis et al., 2011, Lambeau and Gelb, 2008, Murakami et al., 2015, Murakami, Taketomi, et al., 2011a). Conventional sPLA2s (group I/II/V/X) are closely related enzymes with a highly conserved Ca2 +-binding loop and a His/Asp catalytic dyad as well as conserved disulfide bonds, while atypical sPLA2s (groups III and XII) are each classified into distinct collections (Fig. 1B). Evolutionally, group IB sPLA2 is the oldest conventional sPLA2 in the animal kingdom since three IB-like genes are present in C. elegans, while group II, V, and X sPLA2s exist only in vertebrates (Murakami, Taketomi, Miki, et al., 2011). Group III sPLA2 is present in vertebrates and insects. The conservation of group XII sPLA2s from bacteria to humans suggests that they emerged early in evolution prior to Eubacteria (Nevalainen & Cardoso, 2012). Group IX, XI, XIII, and XIV sPLA2s are present in invertebrates, plants, viruses, and fungi, respectively, but not in vertebrates. The tissue or cellular distributions and stimulus inducibility of individual sPLA2s are distinct (Fig. 2\n), suggesting their different biological roles. As sPLA2s are secreted and require millimolar Ca2 + for their catalysis, they act essentially on extracellular phospholipids, including those in adjacent cell membranes, microparticles, surfactant, lipoproteins, and foreign lipids in foods or microorganisms, in response to microenvironmental cues.",

            "text": "Biochemical analyses have shown that individual sPLA2s have distinct substrate selectivity in terms of polar head groups or sn-2 fatty acids of phospholipids. With regard to polar head groups, PLA2G2A and other group II sPLA2s show preference for phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) over phosphatidylcholine (PC), while PLA2G10 is very active on PC, and these preferences can be partly explained in terms of crystal structure (Pan et al., 2002, Scott et al., 1991). With regard to sn-2 fatty acids, PLA2G1B, PLA2G2A, and PLA2G2E do not distinguish fatty acid species, PLA2G5 prefers fatty acids with a lower degree of unsaturation (eg, oleic acid (OA)), and PLA2G2D, PLA2G2F, PLA2G3, and PLA2G10 show preference for polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) such as arachidonic acid (AA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) to various degrees (Chen and Dennis, 1998, Chen et al., 1994b, Cupillard et al., 1997, Guillaume et al., 2015, Hanasaki et al., 1999, Miki et al., 2013, Mitsuishi et al., 2007, Murakami et al., 2003, Murase et al., 2016, Pruzanski et al., 2005, Sato et al., 2014, Yamamoto et al., 2015). Although the substrate specificity of sPLA2s differs according to the in vitro assay conditions employed, particularly when excess amounts of the enzymes are used, the overall tendency is recapitulated in several if not all in vivo systems, often with even more selective patterns of hydrolysis that may be affected by the phospholipid compositions of the target membranes. The classification, biochemical, and cell biological features of sPLA2s have been detailed in other recent reviews (Dennis et al., 2011, Lambeau and Gelb, 2008, Murakami and Lambeau, 2013, Murakami et al., 2015, Murakami et al., 2010, Murakami, Taketomi, et al., 2011a, Murakami et al., 2014, Murakami, Taketomi, et al., 2011b). In this chapter, we highlight the in vivo functions and associated lipid-metabolic actions of sPLA2s in the context of immunity and related diseases as revealed by studies using transgenic (TG) and/or knockout (KO) mice in combination with sophisticated lipidomics approaches to reveal their in vivo lipid substrates and metabolites.",

            "text": "Some of the biological actions of sPLA2s in vivo have been addressed using sPLA2-overexpressing TG mice, which have provided informative insights into the potential pathophysiological roles of sPLA2s (Ait-Oufella et al., 2013, Cash et al., 2011, Curfs et al., 2008, Grass et al., 1996, Ivandic et al., 1999, Laine et al., 1999, Mulherkar et al., 2003, Ohtsuki et al., 2006, Sato et al., 2011, Sato et al., 2008, Sato et al., 2009, Taketomi et al., 2013, Yamamoto et al., 2015, Yamamoto et al., 2011). In this section, we briefly summarize general aspects, rather than describing individual topics in detail, of sPLA2-TG mice. It is noteworthy that not all sPLA2-TG mice develop inflammatory phenotypes, arguing against the current assumption that sPLA2s generally participate in inflammation by producing proinflammatory eicosanoids (ie, AA metabolites) including prostaglandins (PGs) and leukotrienes (LTs). More critically, the overall phenotypes of TG mice for different sPLA2s are not entirely identical. If different sPLA2s have similar enzymatic properties, then the resulting phenotypes of mice that are TG for them would be expected to be similar, but this is not actually the case. The most likely explanation for this is that individual sPLA2s have distinct enzymatic properties, acting on different phospholipid substrates and mobilizing different lipid metabolites in vivo. For instance, Pla2g5-TG mice display neonatal death due to lung collapse, whereas TG mice for other sPLA2s do not show such a lethal phenotype (Grass et al., 1996, Ohtsuki et al., 2006, Sato et al., 2008, Yamamoto et al., 2015). This is likely because PLA2G5, compared with other sPLA2s, is potently active on dipalmitoyl-PC, a major surfactant phospholipid, under in vivo conditions. If TG mice for a certain sPLA2 display a particular phenotype opposite to that in KO mice deficient in the same sPLA2, we can emphasize that this phenotype reflects the intrinsic function of the given sPLA2. In this case, TG mice are useful for screening potential substrates and products driven by this enzyme in vivo, since lipid mobilizations in sPLA2-TG mice are typically large and easy to monitor using lipidomics approaches. In subsequent sections, some examples of these findings will be presented.",

An example is alopecia (hair loss) observed in PLA2G2A- or PLA2G10-TG mice (Grass et al., 1996, Yamamoto et al., 2011), despite the fact that endogenous expression of these sPLA2s in mouse skin is very low or undetectable (Yamamoto et al., 2015). In fact, when artificially overexpressed in the skin, these sPLA2s mimic the intrinsic actions of PLA2G2F, a major sPLA2 endogenously expressed in the epidermis (see later). Furthermore, PLA2G3-TG mice exhibit a distinct skin phenotype manifested by age-associated spontaneous inflammation (Sato et al., 2009), whereas TG mice for other sPLA2s do not show noticeable skin abnormality (unpublished results). These observations again imply that different sPLA2s have distinct enzymatic properties, hydrolyzing different phospholipids to mobilize different lipid products in vivo.",

            "text": "Because of its low affinity for PC as mentioned earlier, PLA2G2A hardly hydrolyzes phospholipids in quiescent mammalian cells by acting directly on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, which is PC rich. Instead, PLA2G2A efficiently hydrolyzes phospholipids in bacterial membranes, which are PE rich. Indeed, PLA2G2A kills bacteria (Gram-positive in particular) at physiological concentrations in vitro (Singer et al., 2002). In addition to this substrate preference, the highly cationic nature of PLA2G2A, which is not shared with other sPLA2s, is also critical for bacterial killing by this enzyme (Koprivnjak et al., 2002, Weiss et al., 1994). Indeed, PLA2G2A is highly expressed in the exocrine glands such as intestinal Paneth cells and tear glands (Qu & Lehrer, 1998), which are continuously exposed to environmental bacteria. Moreover, PLA2G2A-TG mice, or WT mice treated with PLA2G2A, show resistance to sepsis or pneumonia following bacterial infection (Laine et al., 1999, Laine et al., 2000, Movert et al., 2011, Pernet et al., 2014, Piris-Gimenez et al., 2005). Hence, it is now generally accepted that PLA2G2A plays an important role in host defense as a \u201cbactericidal sPLA2.\u201d Some bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus anthracis can escape the bactericidal action of PLA2G2A by suppressing its induction in macrophages (Pernet et al., 2014, Raymond et al., 2007).",

A number of cell-based studies have shown that PLA2G2A, when overexpressed or added exogenously at high concentrations, is capable of releasing AA from cytokine-primed or apoptotic cells, in which its preferred substrate PE or phosphatidylserine (PS) might be exposed on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane (Koduri et al., 2002; Murakami et al., 1998). However, it is unclear whether this system is in fact operative in vivo. Recently, the concept that PLA2G2A acts as a driver of sterile inflammation has been examined in a series of studies by Boilard and colleagues, who backcrossed the mutated Pla2g2a allele in the C57BL/6 strain onto the BALB/c strain to produce Pla2g2a\n\u2212/\u2212 BALB/c mice. These Pla2g2a\n\u2212/\u2212 mice are protected from autoantibody-induced arthritis, a model of rheumatoid arthritis, whereas PLA2G2A-TG mice are more susceptible to this arthritis model (Boilard et al., 2010). These complementary results obtained using KO and TG mice strongly support the proinflammatory role of PLA2G2A.",

            "text": "Furthermore, Boilard and colleagues have elegantly shown that PLA2G2A hydrolyzes phospholipids in microparticles, particularly in extracellular mitochondria (a type of organelle that evolutionally originated from bacteria), which are released from activated platelets or leukocytes at inflamed sites (Boudreau et al., 2014). Hydrolytic breakdown of mitochondrial or microparticular membranes by PLA2G2A gives rise to inflammatory mediators including eicosanoids and lysophospholipids, as well as mitochondrial DNA (DAMP; danger-associated molecular pattern), which promotes leukocyte activation. Moreover, PLA2G2A-targeted extracellular mitochondria or microparticles interact with neutrophils, allowing their adhesion to the vascular walls. Hydrolysis of microparticles by PLA2G2A results in the production of 12S-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE), an AA metabolite that acts on its receptor BLT2 to amplify cytokine production and cPLA2\u03b1-dependent LTB4 generation by neutrophils, thereby leading to acceleration of sterile inflammation (Duchez et al., 2015). These breakthrough findings account for a long-sought mechanism for the role of PLA2G2A as an \u201cinflammatory sPLA2.\u201d Thus, it is likely that PLA2G2A is primarily involved in host defense by killing bacteria and triggering innate immunity, whereas overamplification of the response leads to inflammation (Fig. 3\n).",

PLA2G2A expression is correlated positively with prostate, lung, and breast cancers (Brglez et al., 2014, Graff et al., 2001, Scott et al., 2010), in which chronic inflammation induced by PLA2G2A might contribute to the promotion of these cancers. Indeed, PGs and LTs, which are potential downstream lipid mediators of PLA2s, are involved in cancer development (Chen et al., 2009, Nakanishi et al., 2008). On the other hand, mouse strains intrinsically lacking PLA2G2A are more susceptible to intestinal tumorigenesis (MacPhee et al., 1995). TG expression of the intact Pla2g2a gene in C57BL/6 mice, a strain that has a mutated Pla2g2a allele, reverses this phenotype (Cormier et al., 1997), indicating that PLA2G2A has an antitumor effect in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Consistently, gene polymorphisms in the PLA2G2A gene are associated with fundic gland polyposis in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (Tomlinson, Beck, Neale, & Bodmer, 1996) and PLA2G2A expression is inversely correlated with the incidence of gastric cancer in humans (Leung et al., 2002). Although at present the mechanism underlying the antitumor role of PLA2G2A in the GI tract remains unclear, it is speculated that PLA2G2A, a \u201cbactericidal sPLA2,\u201d secreted from intestinal Paneth cells or colorectal epithelial cells may alter the intestinal microbiota, thereby affecting tumor development.",

In the elicitation phase, the resolution, but not propagation, of inflammation in the skin and LNs is delayed in Pla2g2d\n\u2212/\u2212 mice (Miki et al., 2013). In the regional LNs, the levels of PUFAs including \u03c96 AA and \u03c93 DHA, as well as their antiinflammatory products including 15-deoxy-PGJ2 and resolvin D1 (RvD1), respectively, are reduced in Pla2g2d\n\u2212/\u2212 mice relative to WT mice, the reduction of the latter being more prominent (Fig. 4A). Together with its substrate selectivity as described earlier, PLA2G2D appears to preferentially hydrolyze AA- or DHA-bearing PE in LN membranes (likely microparticles), thereby mobilizing AA- or DHA-derived antiinflammatory lipid mediators (the latter in particular) that dampen Th1-driven adaptive immunity (Fig. 4B). Indeed, \u03c93 PUFA-derived resolvins suppress acquired immunity by dampening DC migration and antigen presentation to T cells (Sawada et al., 2015). Furthermore, administration of a PLA2G2D-Fc fusion protein to mice prevents experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and colitis (von Allmen et al., 2009). Thus, PLA2G2D is a \u201cresolving sPLA2\u201d that ameliorates DC-committed innate and adaptive immune responses by mobilizing antiinflammatory lipid mediators. This is, to our knowledge, the first example of a particular sPLA2 that mobilizes \u03c93 DHA and its metabolites in vivo.",

Pla2g2d\n\u2212/\u2212 mice are resistant to infection-induced death, accompanied by enhanced migration of lung DCs to draining LNs, augmented antivirus T-cell responses, and decreased lung injury. In this case, PLA2G2D is responsible for the pulmonary mobilization of PGD2, which, by acting on its antiinflammatory receptor DP1, dampens DC migration and thereby T-cell-driven antivirus responses (Fig. 4C). Accordingly, the attenuated antiviral immunity in Pla2g2d\n\u2212/\u2212 mice results in severe lung inflammation and early death. Thus, directed inhibition of PLA2G2D in the lungs of older patients with severe respiratory infections would be a potentially attractive therapeutic intervention for restoration of immune function.",

Psoriasis is one of the most common chronic skin diseases in western countries, characterized by epidermal hyperplasia (acanthosis), scaling, and erythematous plaque formation due to aberrant proliferation, differentiation, and activation of keratinocytes as well as infiltration and activation of immune cells such as Th17 cytokine-producing lymphocytes (Lowes, Suarez-Farinas, & Krueger, 2014). Strikingly, Pla2g2f\n\u2212/\u2212 mice are protected from epidermal hyperplasia in models of Th17-dependent psoriasis and Th1-dependent CHS (Yamamoto et al., 2015). In the former model, PLA2G2F expression in keratinocytes is upregulated by IL-22 and to a lesser extent by IL-17A. In Pla2g2f\n\u2212/\u2212 primary keratinocytes, IL-22- or IL-17A-induced expression of several psoriasis markers such as S100A9 and IL-36 is markedly impaired. Mechanistically, PLA2G2F hydrolyzes P-PE secreted from keratinocytes to yield P-LPE, a unique lysophospholipid that accelerates the differentiation and activation of keratinocytes, leading to propagation of skin inflammation (Fig. 5B). This finding provides the first in vivo evidence that a particular sPLA2 regulates a biological process by mobilizing a lysophospholipid mediator.",

            "text": "Mast cells are known for their plasticity, and environmentally induced alterations in mast cell phenotypes could affect the severity of immediate hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis (Gurish and Austen, 2012, Rivera et al., 2008). Crosslinking of the high-affinity IgE receptor Fc\u025bRI on mast cells with IgE and antigen initiates signals leading to the release of allergic mediators such as histamine and eicosanoids that induce allergic inflammation. Activated mast cells produce PGD2, LTB4, and LTC4 as main eicosanoids, and accumulating evidence suggests that mast cell-derived LTB4 and LTC4 exacerbate, while PGD2 ameliorates, allergic diseases (Kanaoka et al., 2001, Nakamura et al., 2015, Ott et al., 2003, Taketomi et al., 2013). The initiation of AA metabolism in mast cells depends solely on cPLA2\u03b1, an AA-selective intracellular PLA2 which, upon Fc\u025bRI signaling, is activated by mitogen-activated protein kinases and undergoes Ca2 +-dependent translocation from the cytosol to perinuclear membranes, where downstream eicosanoid-biosynthetic enzymes reside (Clark et al., 1991, Lin et al., 1993, Ueno et al., 2011). Allergic responses, such as asthma, are attenuated in mice lacking cPLA2\u03b1 (Pla2g4a\n\u2212/\u2212) or those treated with a cPLA2\u03b1 inhibitor (Malaviya et al., 2006, Uozumi et al., 1997). However, the roles of sPLA2s in allergy in the context of mast cell biology in vivo have remained elusive over the last few decades.",

Exogenous human PLA2G3 also facilitates mast cell activation in mouse skin (Taketomi et al., 2013), and endogenous PLA2G3 is stored in and released from mouse mast cell granules. Importantly, mast cell-dependent passive and active anaphylactic responses are markedly attenuated in Pla2g3\n\u2212/\u2212 mice and conversely augmented in PLA2G3-TG mice (Taketomi et al., 2013). This phenotype is mast cell autonomous, as bone marrow-derived mast cells from Pla2g3\n\u2212/\u2212 mice fail to reconstitute the anaphylactic response after transfer to mast cell-deficient Kit\nW-sh/W-sh mice. Notably, mast cells in Pla2g3\n\u2212/\u2212 mice are numerically normal but morphologically and functionally immature, indicating that PLA2G3 does not merely act as a mast cell activator but also facilitates mast cell maturation. Moreover, mast cell abnormalities observed in Pla2g3\n\u2212/\u2212 mice are recapitulated in mice lacking lipocalin-type PGD2 synthase (L-PGDS), which is expressed in neighboring fibroblasts, or those lacking the PGD2 receptor DP1, which is induced in maturing mast cells. Pharmacological or genetic ablation of DP1 in mast cells or L-PGDS in fibroblasts phenocopies that of PLA2G3 in mast cells in terms of perturbed mast cell maturation and anaphylaxis (Taketomi et al., 2013).",

The primary cilium is a microtubule-based organelle that projects from the surface of a wide variety of cells and acts as an antenna to sense extracellular cues and regulate diverse signaling pathways (Berbari et al., 2009, Christensen et al., 2007). Defects of cilium formation have been recognized as a central event in many types of pathologic states, including classical ciliopathies, obesity, and cancer (Fliegauf et al., 2007, Sen Gupta et al., 2009).

However, subsequent studies, pioneered by Arm and coworkers, have shown that in several situations PLA2G5 exerts antiinflammatory functions, which may rely on a common mechanism involving the regulation of macrophage phagocytosis by this sPLA2. Peritoneal macrophages from Pla2g5\n\u2212/\u2212 mice show reduced phagocytosis of fungi (yeast and Candida albicans) ex vivo, and Pla2g5\n\u2212/\u2212 mice display severe systemic candidiasis with higher mortality due to an increased fungal burden in multiple tissues in vivo (Balestrieri et al., 2006, Balestrieri et al., 2009). In this regard, PLA2G5 contributes to antifungal innate immunity by facilitating phagocytotic killing. Likewise, increased airway inflammation in Pla2g5\n\u2212/\u2212 mice after Escherichia coli infection could be explained, in part, by reduced clearance of the bacterium by alveolar macrophages (Degousee et al., 2011). Arthritis is also exacerbated in Pla2g5\n\u2212/\u2212 mice, where opsonization-driven clearance of the pathogenic immune complex by macrophages is hampered (Boilard et al., 2010). Exogenous supplementation or adenoviral transfer of PLA2G5 into Pla2g5\n\u2212/\u2212 mice can rescue Candida clearance and ameliorate arthritis by facilitating macrophage phagocytosis of the fungi and immune complex, respectively. Conceivably, the opposing functions of PLA2G5 and PLA2G2A in protection from and promotion of arthritis, respectively, could explain why a pan-sPLA2 inhibitor failed to exert a therapeutic effect on rheumatoid arthritis in a clinical study (Bradley et al., 2005).",

Pla2g5\n\u2212/\u2212 mice are protected from antigen-induced asthma and LPS- or ventilator-induced alveolar injury (Giannattasio et al., 2010, Henderson et al., 2013, Meliton et al., 2013, Munoz et al., 2007, Munoz et al., 2009, Ohta et al., 2013), indicating that PLA2G5 acts as a proinflammatory enzyme in the airway. Bone marrow transfer experiments have revealed that PLA2G5 in antigen-presenting cells promotes antigen uptake and thereby antigen presentation to T cells for eliciting a Th2 response, while PLA2G5 in airway epithelial cells augments lung injury, probably through surfactant degradation (Giannattasio et al., 2010, Henderson et al., 2013, Ohta et al., 2013, Ohtsuki et al., 2006). Importantly, PLA2G5 is the only sPLA2 isoform induced by the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 in M2 macrophages and Th2 cells and promotes the Th2 immune response by facilitating IL-4 expression and IgE production by LN cells (Ohta et al., 2013, Rubio et al., 2015, Sato et al., 2014). Indeed, PLA2G5 expression in IL-4-driven M2 macrophages is sufficient for development of asthma induced by house dust mites (Ohta et al., 2013). The property of PLA2G5 as a \u201cTh2/M2-prone sPLA2\u201d appears to fit with the view that Pla2g5\n\u2212/\u2212 mice are protected from asthma (Th2 dependent; Giannattasio et al., 2010, Munoz et al., 2007), whereas they suffer from more severe infection (Th1 dependent) and arthritis (Th17 dependent) (Balestrieri et al., 2009, Boilard et al., 2010), where Th1/Th17 immunity is counterbalanced by Th2 immunity. This immune balance regulation by PLA2G5 toward a Th2/M2-prone state could thus explain why this enzyme exhibits pro- or antiinflammatory actions depending on distinct disease contexts. This notion may also be true for the metabolic role of PLA2G5, as described later. The roles of PLA2G5 in phagocytosis and Th2 immunity are illustrated in Fig. 7A.",

The mechanisms connecting insulin resistance to obesity include an elevation of circulating lipids, ectopic lipid deposition leading to lipotoxicity, and chronic inflammation in metabolically active tissues (Hotamisligil, 2006). Among the sPLA2s, PLA2G5 is highly induced in hypertrophic adipocytes of obese mice (Sato et al., 2014). This fact, along with the constitutive expression of PLA2G5 at relatively high levels in the heart, which has a high demand for lipids as an energy source (Fig. 7B), suggests that regulation of energy metabolism may be one of the primary roles of this sPLA2. The levels of Pla2g5 expression in WAT and the heart are markedly elevated in aged mice relative to young mice (Fig. 7C), perhaps reflecting its upregulation in age-related obesity and/or through an unknown mechanism.",

Mechanistically, PLA2G5 protects against metabolic disorders by normalizing the lipid content in fat-overladen LDL and by tipping the immune balance toward an M2/Th2 state that counterregulates adipose tissue inflammation. Unsaturated fatty acids (OA and LA) released from PC in hyperlipidemic LDL by adipocyte-driven PLA2G5 prevent M1 polarization of adipose tissue macrophages by palmitic acid, a saturated fatty acid that promotes metabolic inflammation. Moreover, in agreement with the role of PLA2G5 in macrophage phagocytosis (see earlier), which might be a result of the altered M1/M2 macrophage ratio, HFD-fed Pla2g5\n\u2212/\u2212 mice show impaired clearance of dead cells in adipose tissue. Overall, PLA2G5 allows adipose tissue to be in an antiinflammatory state by regulating the balance between detrimental saturated fatty acids and beneficial unsaturated fatty acids. Additionally, given that Th2 immunity counteracts metabolic diseases (Odegaard & Chawla, 2013), the reduced whole-body Th2/M2 status in Pla2g5\n\u2212/\u2212 mice (see earlier) may also underlie the exacerbated metabolic outcomes. These results reveal the physiological importance of lipoprotein hydrolysis by sPLA2 and highlight PLA2G5, a \u201cmetabolic sPLA2,\u201d as an integrated regulator of metabolism and inflammation (Sato et al., 2014). The metabolic regulation by PLA2G5 is illustrated in Fig. 7D. Of note, PLA2G5 expression in human adipose tissue inversely correlates with plasma LDL levels (Sato et al., 2014) and PLA2G5 mutations are associated with LDL levels in patients with type 2 diabetes or obesity (Sergouniotis et al., 2011, Wootton et al., 2007), implying the relevance of these findings to humans.",

            "text": "Prior to discovery of the role of PLA2G5 as a \u201cmetabolic sPLA2\u201d as described earlier, this enzyme has long been implicated in atherosclerosis. In this scenario, sPLA2-mediated hydrolysis of LDL gives rise to a type of proatherogenic small-dense LDL with an increased net negative charge, LPC content, and aggregation propensity (Hanasaki et al., 2002, Wooton-Kee et al., 2004). Treatment of LDL with several sPLA2s (X > V > III > IIF > IIA in rank order) facilitates the hydrolysis of phospholipids and thereby the formation of lipid-laden foam cells from macrophages in vitro (Boyanovsky et al., 2005, Hanasaki et al., 2002, Sato et al., 2008), a hallmark feature of atherosclerosis. However, the in vivo relevance of this phenomenon remains controversial. Ldlr\n\u2212/\u2212 mice transferred with Pla2g5\n\u2212/\u2212 bone marrow cells are modestly protected from atherosclerosis (Bostrom et al., 2007), whereas global Pla2g5 deficiency on an Apoe\n\u2212/\u2212 background does not affect plaque formation (Boyanovsky, Zack, Forrest, & Webb, 2009). Although the former study suggested that hematopoietic (probably macrophage) PLA2G5 contributes partially to atherosclerosis development, plasma LDL levels are unaffected by Pla2g5 ablation in both cases, arguing against the proposed role of PLA2G5 in LDL metabolism under atherosclerotic conditions. Contradictory results have also been reported for the roles of PLA2G5 in cardiac disorders, where Pla2g5 ablation aggravates cardiac fibrosis (Boyanovsky, Bailey, Dixon, Shridas, & Webb, 2012), whereas conversely it attenuates myocardial infarction and aneurysm (Boyanovsky et al., 2012, Yano et al., 2011). Moreover, a pan-sPLA2 inhibitor failed to show efficacy in a phase III clinical trial in the context of cardiovascular disease (Nicholls et al., 2014). Thus, PLA2G5 or any other conventional sPLA2s may not contribute significantly to atherosclerosis or related cardiovascular disorders, even though it may promote or suppress them under certain conditions. Rather, LDL hydrolysis by PLA2G5 appears to be relevant to obesity-related metabolic syndrome, as described earlier.",

            "text": "Several studies have demonstrated that PLA2G10 is expressed in pulmonary epithelial cells, although at much lower levels than in the GI tract and testis. Perhaps asthma is the best-studied disease in which PLA2G10 exerts proinflammatory functions through AA metabolism. Pla2g10\n\u2212/\u2212 mice show resistance to antigen-induced asthma, with marked reductions of eosinophil infiltration, goblet cell hyperplasia, smooth muscle layer thickening, and pulmonary eicosanoid synthesis (Henderson et al., 2007). The attenuated asthmatic responses in Pla2g10\n\u2212/\u2212 mice are restored by knock-in of the human PLA2G10 gene, and treatment of these knock-in mice with an inhibitor specific for human PLA2G10 attenuates pulmonary inflammation (Henderson et al., 2011). Unlike PLA2G5 (see earlier), however, PLA2G10 does not influence the Th2 response itself, since IgE and IL-4 levels are unaffected in Pla2g10\n\u2212/\u2212 mice (Henderson et al., 2013). Mechanistically, PLA2G10 secreted from the airway epithelium may act on infiltrating eosinophils in a paracrine manner to trigger the LPC-dependent activation of cPLA2\u03b1 for LTC4 biosynthesis (Hallstrand et al., 2016, Lai et al., 2010). Selective inhibition of PLA2G10 attenuates the fMLP-induced release of AA and LTC4 by human eosinophils, suggesting an autocrine amplification of AA metabolism through the coordinated action of eosinophil-secreted PLA2G10 and intracellular cPLA2\u03b1 (Hallstrand et al., 2016). In addition, PLA2G10 is induced during in vitro differentiation of airway epithelial cells, from which it appears to elicit AA release directly (Hallstrand et al., 2013). Pla2g10\n\u2212/\u2212 mice are also partially protected from the early phase of lung inflammation following influenza infection (Kelvin et al., 2014). Moreover, PLA2G10 is a major sPLA2 isoform detected in the airway of patients with asthma (Hallstrand et al., 2011). Thus, PLA2G10, an \u201casthmatic sPLA2,\u201d may be a novel therapeutic target for asthma or other inflammatory diseases in the airway.",

This phenotype is accompanied by marked elevation of antiinflammatory \u03c93 PUFAs and their metabolites in multiple tissues, indicating for the first time that PLA2G10 has the capacity to release \u03c93 PUFAs in vivo. In an effort to obtain physiological insight into this phenomenon, studies using Pla2g10\n\u2212/\u2212 mice have demonstrated that endogenous PLA2G10, which is expressed abundantly in the colon epithelium as a \u201cgastrointestinal sPLA2,\u201d mobilizes \u03c93 PUFAs and their metabolites, rather than \u03c96 AA metabolites, thereby protecting the tissue from dextran sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis (Murase et al., 2016). Pla2g10 deficiency increases the colorectal expression of Th17 cytokines, and \u03c93 PUFAs themselves attenuate the production of these cytokines by lamina propria cells from DSS-treated mice, at least in part through the PUFA receptor GPR120. In comparison, the production of colon-protective prostanoids, such as PGE2 (Kabashima et al., 2002), is regulated mainly by cPLA2\u03b1 (Murase et al., 2016). These results underscore a previously unappreciated role of PLA2G10 as an \u03c93 PUFA mobilizer in vivo, segregated mobilization of \u03c93 and \u03c96 PUFAs by PLA2G10 and cPLA2\u03b1, respectively, in protection against colitis, and a functional connection between a particular sPLA2 and a PUFA-sensing receptor (Fig. 8A and B).",

Pla2g10\n\u2212/\u2212 mice are protected from myocardial infarction or aneurysm (Fujioka et al., 2008, Watanabe et al., 2012, Zack et al., 2011). Different groups have reported opposite (promoting or protecting) atherosclerotic phenotypes in Pla2g10\n\u2212/\u2212 mice (Ait-Oufella et al., 2013, Zack et al., 2011). In humans, it has been reported that PLA2G10 gene polymorphisms are negatively correlated with a risk of recurrent cardiovascular events or not associated with such a risk (Gora et al., 2009, Guardiola et al., 2015). Pla2g10\n\u2212/\u2212 mice display increased or reduced adiposity (Li et al., 2010, Sato et al., 2011), altered or unaltered macrophage functions (Shridas et al., 2011), increased adrenal steroidogenesis probably through PUFA-mediated perturbation of nuclear receptor signaling (Shridas et al., 2010), or altered insulin secretion by pancreatic \u03b2 cells, perhaps due to reduced PGE2 synthesis (Shridas, Zahoor, Forrest, Layne, & Webb, 2014). As PLA2G10 is expressed abundantly in the gut epithelium, decreased digestion of dietary and biliary phospholipids may be eventually associated with the reduced adiposity in Pla2g10\n\u2212/\u2212 mice (Sato et al., 2011), a situation similar to that in Pla2g1b\n\u2212/\u2212 mice (see later). Alternatively, PLA2G10 in the GI tract might alter the microbiota, which could secondarily affect both immune and metabolic balance (Ley et al., 2005, Mazmanian et al., 2005, Tremaroli and Backhed, 2012). This could explain some of the discrepancies observed in Pla2g10\n\u2212/\u2212 mice maintained in different facilities, although this will require experimental confirmation.",

            "text": "PLA2G1B (sPLA2-IB), a prototypic isoform often referred to as pancreatic sPLA2, is secreted from pancreatic acinar cells into the intestinal lumen, where an N-terminal heptapeptide of the zymogen is cleaved by trypsin to yield an active enzyme (Seilhamer et al., 1986, Verheij et al., 1983). Although the immunological function of PLA2G1B is unknown, Pla2g1b\n\u2212/\u2212 mice are refractory to diet-induced metabolic disorders and atherosclerosis (Hollie and Hui, 2011, Hollie et al., 2014, Huggins et al., 2002, Labonte et al., 2006), suggesting that absence of PLA2G1B may indirectly ameliorate metabolic inflammation. These phenotypes in Pla2g1b\n\u2212/\u2212 mice are most likely explained by reduced digestion of dietary and biliary phospholipids in the GI tract (Huggins et al., 2002). Accordingly, the reduced production and absorption of LPC in the GI tract, a causal factor for insulin resistance, leads to protection from metabolic disorders (Hollie and Hui, 2011, Hollie et al., 2014, Labonte et al., 2006). On the other hand, pancreatic acinar cell-specific Pla2g1b-TG mice develop more severe obesity and insulin intolerance (Cash et al., 2011). Oral administration of a cell-impermeable pan-sPLA2 inhibitor to mice attenuates diet-induced obesity and diabetes by inhibiting PLA2G1B (and probably PLA2G10) in the GI tract (Hui et al., 2009). Thus, pharmacological inhibition of PLA2G1B, a \u201cdigestive sPLA2,\u201d could be an effective oral therapy for metabolic diseases.",

Nonetheless, in relation to immunity, a Pla2g2c knockdown study has demonstrated that PLA2G2C is induced in mouse hepatocytes after infection with hepatitis B to produce LPE, a lysophospholipid antigen. LPE is then presented to CD1d on NKT cells, leading to propagation of an antivirus immune response (Zeissig et al., 2012). It remains unknown whether other sPLA2s may compensate for this function of PLA2G2C in human hepatocytes.",

Pla2g2e\n\u2212/\u2212 mice are modestly protected from diet-induced obesity, fatty liver, and hyperlipidemia, without any accompanying alteration of adipose tissue inflammation (Sato et al., 2014). Mechanistically, PLA2G2E hydrolyzes the minor lipoprotein phospholipids, PE and PS, thereby affecting lipoprotein-mediated lipid delivery to adipose tissue and liver. Unlike the situation in mice, however, PLA2G2A rather than PLA2G2E is highly expressed in human or rat adipose tissue, where PLA2G2A might act in place of PLA2G2E. Indeed, administration of a PLA2G2A-specific inhibitor to rats prevents metabolic disorders (Iyer et al., 2012). In humans, a polymorphism in the PLA2G2E gene is associated with ulcerative colitis (Yang et al., 2013).",

            "text": "PLA2R1, also known as Clec13c belonging to the C-type lectin family, binds to several conventional sPLA2s with distinct affinities in a species-specific manner (Rouault et al., 2007). PLA2R1 may act as a clearance receptor that inactivates sPLA2s, as a signaling receptor that transduces sPLA2-dependent signals in a catalytic activity-independent manner, or as a pleiotropic receptor that binds to non-sPLA2 ligands (Valentin & Lambeau, 2000). In allergen-induced asthma, the lungs of Pla2r1\n\u2212/\u2212 mice display advanced inflammation, accompanied by greater accumulation of PLA2G1B and PLA2G10 proteins (Tamaru et al., 2013), providing the first in vivo evidence that PLA2R1 serves as a clearance receptor for these sPLA2s. In myocardial infarction, Pla2r1\n\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibit higher rates of cardiac rupture and myofibroblast activation (Mishina et al., 2014), where PLA2R1, by interacting with integrin, may transmit sPLA2-dependent signals to augment myofibroblast-driven wound healing or may facilitate the clearance of offensive sPLA2s (eg, PLA2G5 or PLA2G10). Pla2r1\n\u2212/\u2212 mice have higher susceptibility to skin tumorigenesis (Vindrieux et al., 2013), which may be based on the sPLA2-independent function of PLA2R1 in senescence or on the impaired clearance of skin-resident offensive sPLA2s (eg, PLA2G2F). Finally, PLA2R1 is a major autoantigen in membranous nephropathy, a severe autoimmune disease leading to podocyte injury and proteinuria (Beck et al., 2009, Stanescu et al., 2011). However, it is not clear whether the role of PLA2R1, which is expressed in podocytes, is sPLA2 dependent or independent, or whether sPLA2s play some roles in the glomerulus by being supplied from the circulation or from mesangial cells, which are known to secrete PLA2G2A under inflammatory conditions (Beck et al., 2003).",

Individual sPLA2s play unique and tissue-specific roles by driving canonical AA metabolism or noncanonical lipid pathways in immunology, metabolism, cancer, or other biological events by hydrolyzing different phospholipid components in various extracellular milieus. Nonetheless, since most of our present knowledge on the functions of sPLA2s has been based on the results of studies using knockout and/or transgenic mice, it is important to translate these findings to humans. Association of sPLA2s with human diseases and their relationships with phenotypes seen in sPLA2 gene-manipulated mice are summarized in Table 1\n. Hopefully, during the next decade, we will gain a more comprehensive picture of the sPLA2-driven lipid networks, thus allowing the therapeutic application of inhibitors for some sPLA2s or sPLA2-driven lipid products to human diseases.",
