Selection of subjects was based on predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Children who met the final diagnosis for ALRTI had at least 3 of the following: fever, tachypnoea, cough, auscultation findings indicative of lower respiratory disease (including rhonchi, crackles, or bronchial breath sounds) and/or chest retraction supported with chest radiographic changes, if available, were included and if nasopharangeal specimens were collected within 24 h of admission. Children who had one of the followings were excluded from the study: congenital or acquired immunosuppressive conditions and patients with conditions posing a potential hazard in obtaining the nasopharyngeal samples. A standardized study protocol was developed to record demographic and medical history of the patients, clinical features including symptoms and signs, outcome of the illness and hospital course, and laboratory and radiological findings. At the end of the hospitalization, the children's charts were reviewed by four of the co-investigators and the clinical diagnosis was determined by the principal investigator. The clinical diagnosis was categorized into pneumonia, bronchiolitis, and post-viral wheeze.",

HRV-A strains represented the majority detection (22/36, 61.1%) as shown in Fig. 1\n.

We found that 14 (39%) of the samples were clustered in the separate clad distinct from HRV-A and HRV-B, along with representative strains of HRV-C (Fig. 2\n). HRV-B strains were not among the typed strains. The nucleotide similarities to closest prototype strain in HRV-A, varied from 85.1% to 95.0%, while the closest genetic relatives were observed with a variation range of 91.2% to 99.8%. The respective HRV-C strain similarities varied from 87.5% to 98.9%. Genetic analysis used for typing revealed four human enterovirus (HEV) strains in species HEV-B, HEV-C and HEV-D. However, it should be noted here that the VP4/VP2 region used for genetic typing of HRV strains does not unequivocally allow typing of HEV strains due to greater sequence similarity between strains within species.",

            "text": "A significant burden of HRV infection, was found in 54 out of 165 patients (33%), and this concurs with previous studies with a rate varying from 26% to 33% in a hospitalized pediatric patient [8], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. This contradicts with the traditional notion that HRV is only associated with upper respiratory tract infections. Earlier studies indicated that the clinical value of positive PCR is somewhat disputable among patients with ALRTI [3], [7], [19], [21] as asymptomatic HRV infections is known to occur in 15\u201330% of individuals. Several subsequent clinical studies of small numbers of selected patients showed that HRV can replicate in lower respiratory tract. This finding concluded that detection of HRV especially in children less than 2 years does not simply represent asymptomatic infection but is related to true infection [7], [22]. In addition, the ability of HRV to infect lower respiratory airways and to induce cytotoxicity to bronchial epithelium has been shown experimentally among immunocompetent individuals [18].",

Our study revealed that HRV infected children were hospitalized earlier in the course of their disease and were less febrile on presentation as compared to RSV and IFV-A infections. They were also more likely to be discharged earlier and tend to receive lesser antibiotics as compared to the other two infections, especially to RSV. HRV is known to have a shorter incubation period and hence presented earlier as compared with HRV or occasionally with IFV-A especially with H1N1 infection. This could be explained further in terms of the cytopathology on the respiratory epithelial cells as HRV is the least invasive with minimal cell damage and secondary bacterial infection is far less a complication compared to RSV and IFV. As a result, patients were subjected to lesser antibiotics and stayed shorter in the hospital as seen in this study. However, neutrophilia as documented in the present study may not reflect secondary bacterial infection in HRV. Several studies in the past, acknowledged the increase infection in both peripheral and airway neutrophils as a risk to development of asthmatic exacerbations. On the other hand, IFA-A infection tended to be associated with diarrhea, as the infection usually resulted in a more systemic involvement with direct invasion of the gastrointestine by the virus [28].",

Although in general, the clinical presentations were comparable for both HRV-A and C, rhonchi and vomiting were more common in HRV-C infected children as compared to HRV-A. In our study, the presence of rhonchi was associated with ALRTI rather than asthma, as only one had asthma as an underlying disease. As shown in previous studies, this finding further supports the role of HRV-C among patients with febrile wheeze in ALRTI. A large clinical cohort study indicated that this group of children has a preexisting predisposition to asthma in early childhood. On the other hand, vomiting has not been reported in other studies as a prominent presentation in HRV-C. Vomiting with coughing is common in children (post-tussive vomiting) and it could be related to the wheezing episodes in our study and indicate a more severe form of infection in HRV-C as compared to HRV-A. Likewise, no characteristic laboratory finding has been associated previously with any specific HRV species; the modest increase in lymphocytes in HRV-A and neutrophils in HRV-C in our study could be coincidental and probably of no clinical importance. Consistent with the study by Jin [29], there was no significant difference in terms of disease severity for both species of HRV. On the other hand, Miller [8] found that HRV-C patients were more likely to require supplemental oxygen than HRV-A. The variations could be partly attributed to bacterial co-infections, viral load and type of the studied population. Therefore, these data must be interpreted with some caution.",
