Genetic factors also contribute significantly to disease expression and severity. Asthma is genetically classified as a complex disorder; as such, it does not follow simple Mendelian inheritance characteristics. Hundreds of genetic association studies on asthma-related phenotypes have been conducted in different populations; these have been recently reviewed.28 Although the importance of gene-by-environment interactions in the expression of disease has recently been highlighted,29, 30 the complexities involved in analyzing these relationships from a functional perspective have proved to be challenging.31 Recent pharmacogenetic evaluations in relationship to chronic \u03b2-agonist use32 and corticosteroid efficacy have provided new insights into the variability of response in asthmatic patients.",

            "text": "Allergen exposure is important in host allergic sensitization and as a common precipitant of asthmatic symptoms in both children and adults. The formation of antigen-specific IgE antibody to aeroallergens (eg, mites, trees, grasses, and animal dander) does not usually occur until 2 to 3 years of life. Thus aeroallergen-induced asthma is uncommon during the first year of life but begins to increase in prevalence during later childhood and adolescence and peaks in the second decade of life. Once established in genetically predisposed individuals, IgE-mediated reactions are a major contributor both to acute asthmatic symptoms and chronic airway inflammation. Chronic low-level exposure to indoor allergens (dust mite and cockroach in particular) might play a major role in both asthma inception and subsequent provocation of symptoms.33 Although a wide variety of inhaled allergens can provoke asthma symptoms, sensitization to house dust mite,34 cockroach,35\nAlternaria species,36 and possibly cat37 are important in the pathogenesis of asthma. Dog, but not cat, ownership during infancy has been shown to reduce the subsequent development of allergic sensitization and atopic dermatitis38; numbers of pets, and not the type of furred pet, might also reduce future risk.39 These diverse findings indicate that these relationships are indeed complex and might involve gene-by-environment interactions. Pollen immunotherapy in school-aged children with only allergic rhinitis at the start of treatment has been demonstrated to reduce significantly the subsequent risk of the development of airway hyperresponsiveness and asthma.40\n",

            "text": "Respiratory tract infections caused by viruses,41\nChlamydia species,42 and Mycoplasma species43 have been implicated in the pathogenesis of asthma. Of these respiratory pathogens, viruses have been demonstrated to be epidemiologically associated with asthma in at least 3 ways. First, during infancy, certain viruses have been implicated as potentially being responsible for the inception of the asthmatic phenotype. The virus most convincingly demonstrated in this regard has been respiratory syncytial virus.12 However, because nearly every child has been infected at least once with this virus by 2 years of age, additional genetic, environmental, or developmental factors must contribute to the propensity of this particular virus to be epidemiologically linked with childhood asthma.44 Second, in patients with established asthma, particularly children, viral upper respiratory tract infections play a significant role in producing acute exacerbations of airway obstruction that might result in frequent outpatient visits or in hospitalizations.45 Rhinovirus, the common cold virus, is the most frequent cause of exacerbations, but other viruses, including parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, and coronavirus, also have been implicated, albeit to a lesser extent. The increased tendency for viral infections to produce lower airway symptoms in asthmatic individuals might be related, at least in part, to interactions among allergic sensitization, allergen exposure, and viral infections acting as cofactors in the induction of acute episodes of airflow obstruction.46, 47 Abnormalities in the innate immune response that would prevent viral replication in airway epithelial cells from asthmatic subjects have recently been demonstrated.41 Third, paradoxically, infections have been considered to have the potential of actually preventing the development of allergic respiratory tract diseases, including asthma. Interest in this area increased after the advancement of the hygiene hypothesis,48 which proposed that increasing family size coincident with an increased number of infections might protect against these developments. On the basis of a progressively broader interpretation of this initial hypothesis,49 a number of other epidemiologic (eg, living on a farm18) and biologic (eg, probiotics50) factors have been evaluated regarding their ability to influence the development of allergic sensitization, asthma, or both.",

Although often asymptomatic in its presentation, many patients have nighttime exacerbations or difficult-to-control symptoms. Confirmation of the importance of GERD to asthma often requires endoscopy and 24-hour monitoring of intraesophageal pH levels, with concomitant measures of peak expiratory flow rates.

Asthma control is defined by an understanding of the patient's asthma severity, which can be viewed in 2 domains: impairment and risk. Impairment is an evaluation of the concurrent degree of control in achieving the following: minimal (or no) chronic symptoms, including nocturnal awakenings caused by asthma; minimal (or no) need for acute rescue therapy, such as inhaled \u03b22-agonists; establishment of a normal lifestyle with no limitations on activities including exercise; and normalization of pulmonary function. The risk domain includes criteria that deal with future events that the treatment program should either prevent or reduce to the greatest extent possible: reduction (or elimination of) in the frequency and severity of asthma exacerbations; minimal or no loss of lung function over time (considered to be a potential consequence of airway remodeling); and minimal or no adverse effects from medications.",

A stepwise approach has been adapted for treatment to accomplish these goals (see http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/asthma/asthsumm.htm).64 The basis of the stepwise approach is to increase the number, frequency, and dose of medications with increasing asthma severity until the patient's disease has been put into remission (ie, achieving optimal control for that individual).

It is further distinguished by multiple phenotypes that might differ on the basis of age of onset, triggering factors, and patterns of severity both during acute exacerbations and on a more chronic basis, as reflected by variably reversible loss of lung function. As a result of this clinical heterogeneity, treatment approaches need to be individualized and modified to obtain and maintain adequate symptom and disease control over time. Although current therapy is targeted at the development of secondary and tertiary prevention strategies, ongoing research is evaluating the prospects of primary prevention as well.",
