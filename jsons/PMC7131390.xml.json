In their mammalian hosts, the parasites have a complex life cycle, with sporozoites transforming into schizonts in white blood cells of the mononuclear lineage, followed by the development of piroplasms in erythrocytes. Identification of the Theileria species and characterisation of parasite stocks are based on different criteria such as vector specificity, parasite morphology, host specificity and pathogenicity, serological cross-reaction as well as cross-protection to other species within the genus (Uilenberg, 1981; Irvin and Morrison, 1987; Morzaria, 1989).",

All naive sheep that were inoculated with sporozoites of the Lahr stock of T. lestoquardi developed malignant ovine theileriosis. Generalised lymph node enlargement and high fever were the most prominent symptoms of the T. lestoquardi infection. Another consistent finding was a marked fall in WBC counts, often resulting in leukopenia that lasted for several days. Anaemia was also recorded in all sheep that survived for more than 3 weeks. Although individuals showed a rather wide variation in range and magnitude of other clinical symptoms, the first appearance of parasites was quite uniform in all sheep. Schizont-infected cells were first seen in lymph nodes draining the site of inoculation but were later also demonstrated in peripheral blood and in lymph nodes at the contra-lateral side.

Infection was proven by the demonstration of schizont-infected cells, albeit in two of four animals only. However, the fact that all sheep reacted serologically following primary inoculation of T. annulata sporozoites, indicated that all sheep had become infected. Infection of all sheep was later confirmed by culture of schizont-infected cells (Leemans et al., 1999). Of particular interest is the fact that in none of these sheep were piroplasms ever observed, indicating that T. annulata is unable to complete its life cycle in sheep. However, piroplasms may have developed at levels too low to be detected by microscopical examination of peripheral blood and no attempts were carried out to analyse whether ticks applied onto T. annulata-infected sheep were able to pick up infection.",

However, several authors have shown that sheep PBMC can become infected in vitro with sporozoites of T. annulata and transform into continuously growing cell lines (Steuber et al., 1986; Entrican et al., 1991), and sheep have been inoculated with autologous in vitro infected T. annulata cells (Steuber et al., 1986). Interestingly, these authors found no erythrocytic stages in sheep inoculated with such autologous cells, whereas mild symptoms of theileriosis, including demonstration of piroplasms, were observed in cattle inoculated with in vitro established T. annulata schizont-infected sheep cells.",

Moreover, schizonts were detected in some of the latter sheep, but not in any of the sheep challenged with T. annulata following T. lestoquardi infection.

It may be of interest that the sheep reacting strongest to T. lestoquardi challenge inoculation was the only animal that had not shown a temperature reaction to primary T. annulata infection. Moreover, both schizonts and piroplasms were demonstrated in all challenged sheep, albeit in some of them at lower levels than in sheep undergoing primary T. lestoquardi infection. Although these parasites in theory could be either T. lestoquardi or T. annulata, the fact that piroplasms also developed, which were never seen during primary T. annulata infection of sheep, made it more likely that they were T. lestoquardi. Also, all challenged sheep reacted serologically with a strong secondary antibody response. Thus, previous infection with T. annulata did not prevent sheep from infection with T. lestoquardi.",
