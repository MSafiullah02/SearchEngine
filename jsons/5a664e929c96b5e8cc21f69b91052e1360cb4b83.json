Briefly, synthetic N-terminally biotinylated Ub thioester (25 mg/mL) and synthetic K48-thiolysine Ub (25 mg/mL) were ligated in 8 M Gdn.HCl / 200 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , pH 7.6 in the presence of 1.2 M mercaptophenyl acetic acid (MPAA) for 16 hours at 37 o C. After HPLC and size exclusion chromatography (SEC), the resulting Bt-diUb Lys48 Cterminal carboxylic acid (13 mg/mL) was converted to its MESNa-thioester using recombinant UBA-E1 ubiquitin activating enzyme (250 nM) in 200 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.7 containing 10 mM ATP, 10 mM MgCl 2 and 100 mM MESNa for 1 hour at 37 o C. After HPLC purification, the appropriate fractions were pooled and lyophilized to yield Bt-diUb Lys48 -MESNa, which was ligated to K48-thiolysine Ub (25 mg/mL) in 8 M Gdn.HCl/ 200 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , pH 7.6 in the presence of 1.2 M MPAA for 16 hours at 37 o C. After HPLC-and Size Exclusion Chromatography the resulting Bt-Ub 3 Lys48 was desulfurized in 8 M Gdn.HCl/200 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , pH 6.8 in the presence of 200 mM TCEP, 75 mM GSH (reduced form) and 75 mM of the radical initiator VA-044. Concomitant HPLC and subsequent SEC-purification resulted in the target compound: Bt-triUb Lys48",

Briefly, the nucleotide sequence (nts 4451-7179) from MERS HCoV ORF1a (GenBank AGV08402.1) and the nucleotide sequence encoding the SARS PLpro minimal domain (nts 4884-5829, aa 1541-1885, PDB: 3MJ5) were gene synthesized by GenScript and subcloned into pET28b with a C-terminal 6xHis-tag. All mutations were generated by over-lapping PCR and verified by sequencing. DUBs (SARS and MERS PLpro and USP21 CD ) were expressed in E.coli BL-21 codon plus RIL cells and purified until homogeneity as previously (Bekes et al., 2015) . Briefly, E.coli was grown at 37\u00baC until OD 600 =1.0 and induced with 1 mM IPTG and further incubated at 30\u00baC for 4 hours. Harvested cell pellets were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80\u00baC until purification. Frozen pellets were thawed on ice and lysed in 20 mM Tris, pH=8.0, 350 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM beta-mercaptoethanol, 1% NP-40 and 10 mM imidazole by sonication. After centrifugation, the supernatant was applied onto Ni-NTA resin (Quiagen) for batch-binding by rotation for 1 hour at 4\u00baC. Ni-bound DUBs were eluted with 20 mM Tris, pH=8.0, 350 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole and 1 mM beta-mercaptoethanol, concentrated and purified by size-exclusion chromatography on a Superdex-75 (16/600) column (GE); peak fractions were collected, concentrated to 1-10 mg/mL, aliquoted and stored at -80\u00baC until use. SARS PLpro mutants were purified by Ni-NTA purifications and buffer exchanged into assay buffer (20 mM Tris, pH=8.0, 150 mM NaCl using BioRad spin-columns and supplemented with 1 mM DTT prior to biochemical assays.",

Inhibition assays were performed at 30\u00baC using a Spectramax fluorescence plate reader running SoftMax Pro 5 (Molecular Devices) operated in kinetic mode, in black, round-bottom 384-well plates (Corning #3698), where free AMC fluorescence was monitored by excitation at 355 nm and emission at 460 nm over time for 5-10 min. Initial linear cleavage rates (V i ) were expressed as percent of no inhibitor cleavage rate for every run and were fitted to Prism's log(inhibitor) vs. normalized curve equation, which calculated IC 50 values. IC 50 were then transformed into K i values based on the equation K i = IC 50 /(S/K M +1), assuming low affinity, competitive inhibition, where S is the concentration of the substrate (Cer et al. 2009, NAR) .
