Therefore, ANPs are metabolically stable due to the presence of a phosphonate linkage (P\u2013C) instead of a phosphoester (P\u2013O), making these compounds resistant towards phosphatases. Furthermore, they do not require the first intracellular phosphorylation step which is often considered as a limiting-step and essential for the antiviral effect. Indeed, ANPs share their mechanism of action with other nucleoside analogues. Briefly, after two subsequent phosphorylation steps the ANP is converted to its corresponding triphosphate derivative, which can then interfere with nucleic acid biosynthesis as a DNA chain terminator.5\n",

The origin of the chemical shift difference is attributed to the shielding cone of the phenyl ring from (S)-MPA; the signals of the substituents under the shielding cone are moved upfield.16 When the phenyl group is eclipsed with the adenine\u2013CH2\u2013CH2 moiety in the less polar diastereomer (Fig. 2), the two methylene groups are shielded and should appear upfield compared to the more polar one. Indeed, we observed that the Ad\u2013CH2\u2013CH\n2 signal resonates at 2.16 ppm in the less polar diastereomer whereas it resonates at 2.28 ppm in the more polar one (\u0394\u03b4 0.12 ppm). Similarly the Ad\u2013CH\n2\u2013CH2 resonates at 3.59 ppm in the less polar diastereomer, whereas it resonates at 4.04 ppm in the more polar one (\u0394\u03b4 0.45 ppm). On the other hand, when the phenyl group is eclipsed with the (CH3O)2P and the CH2P(O) groups, as in the more polar diastereomer, both the methyl and methylene protons are shielded and should appear upfield with respect to the less polar one. Indeed, the two methyl protons of the (CH3O)2P group resonate at 3.51 and 3.49 ppm in the more polar diastereomer (Fig. 2), whereas in the less polar one, they resonate at 3.61 and 3.57 ppm (\u0394\u03b4 0.1 and \u0394\u03b4 0.08 ppm, respectively).

This difference can be attributed to the \u03c0-stacking effect between the phenyl ring and the nucleobase. This observation was supported by molecular modelling studies and suggested that the H-8 proton was in close proximity to the phenyl ring. The 2D NMR-NOESY spectra were also obtained and a selected portion is shown in Figure 3\n. In the case of the less polar diastereomer (R,S)-8, we clearly observed cross peaks between the H-8 proton of the nucleobase and the aromatic protons of MPA with both the adenine\u2013CH2\u2013CH2 moiety and the (CH3O)2P groups (Fig. 3B). In comparison with an identical part of the 2D NOESY spectrum of the more polar diastereomer, due to the overlapping of the signals of interest, less relevant cross peaks were observed (Fig. 3A). Consequently, the 1H-, 13C- and 31P-NMR spectra of both isolated diastereoisomers strongly suggested that the absolute configuration of the less polar compound is (R,S)-8 while the more polar compound is (S,S)-9.",

Atomic charges and potentials were assigned using the Gasteiger\u2013Marsili empirical atomic partial charges17, 18 and Charmm22 force field,19 respectively. Then, four planar angles were selected corresponding to the bonds of the methoxy and carbonyl groups of MPA and the proton at the \u03b2-position to the phosphorus atom of each diastereomer, and a systemic conformational search using the AMMP (Another Molecular Mechanics Program) program20 and Charmm22 as Force field was carried out on the diastereomeric pair. Molecular modelling studies supported the NMR chemical shift analysis of each diastereomer due to the geometry predicted by Mosher\u2019s approximation21 in which the methoxy and carbonyl groups of MPA and the proton at the \u03b2-position to the phosphorus atom are in almost the same plane for both diastereomers (Fig. 4\n).",

The newly obtained derivatives were assayed in various cell lines (including HEL, CRFK, Vero, MDCK and HeLa cells) for antiviral activity against a wide variety of DNA and RNA viruses [varicella zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1, KOS and TK- KOS), HSV-2 (G), vaccinia virus and vesicular stomatitis viruses, feline herpes and corona viruses, parainfluenza-3, reovirus-1, Sindbis, Coxsackie B4 and Punta Toro virus, influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2) and influenza B viruses and respiratory syncytial virus]. However, none of them revealed a significant effect up to 100 \u03bcM. Cytotoxicity was evaluated on HEL, Vero, HeLa and MDCK cell cultures and the studied compounds were found to be non-toxic (up to 100 \u03bcM). Further studies are currently underway to tentatively explain the lack of biological activity.",
