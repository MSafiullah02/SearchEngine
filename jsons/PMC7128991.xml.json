The use of culture to detect respiratory pathogens became increasingly common in clinical virology laboratories during the last 50 years with the commercial availability of cell cultures. However, with the introduction of commercially manufactured and FDA-approved molecular assays, including multiplexed PCR assays, the preference for testing viral pathogens using cell culture systems is diminishing [2]. In this case study we describe the utility of cell culture followed by electron microscopy (EM) to identify an unknown pathogen causing ILI in a healthy 19 year old woman. Moreover, the case highlights the importance of providing relevant case history in order to avoid unnecessary testing.",
