Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), along with its coreceptor CD14, is activated by bacterial lipopolysaccharide. The RSV-specific F-protein elicits a similar TLR4 response, but the response is significantly weaker than the lipopolysaccharide response.9 Another cofactor, the MD-2 polypeptide, is believed to play an important role in the TLR4 pathway described above, but this relationship is still under investigation. Lipopolysaccharide antagonist analogs that lower LPS mandated TLR4 activation also lower RSV F-protein\u2013mandated TLR4 activation.9 The measurement of RSV F-protein levels, TLR4 activation, and MD-2 levels offers a potentially novel biomarker system in the pediatric domain for prognostic purposes.9 Serum vitamin D levels are another biomarker under research for acute bronchiolitis. Serum vitamin D levels have been shown to vary directly with immunoglobulin G and A levels and inversely with immunoglobulin E levels in the acute stages of bronchiolitis.10 Data from a recent clinical trial showed that serum vitamin D levels were significantly lower in children with acute-phase bronchiolitis compared with healthy controls.10\n",

Before that, DNA- or RNA-based diagnostic and prognostic tests have to be cost-effective and rapid enough to be clinically effective in a busy ED setting.

Interlukin-6 is also relevant to several pathogenic inflammatory states, with serum concentrations varying directly with sepsis severity, onset of H1N1 type A, and severe acute respiratory syndrome.12 Serum IL-6 in pandemic H1N1 was significantly higher in patients who required critical care support compared with those who did not; however, this did not affect disease outcome.12 This suggests that IL-6 shows potential as a biomarker of disease severity, but not as a therapeutic agent. As mentioned above for bronchiolitis biomarkers, serum levels of IL-6 would require a blood sample and thus are nonideal in the pediatric ED. During influenza virus infection, epithelial cells, macrophages, lymphocytes, and other cells release a complex series of cytokines and chemokines in an attempt to overcome viral replication and disease progression.13, 14, 15 Nitric oxide (NO), a key mediator of airway inflammation, is also released. It is unclear if increased NO activity is a marker of clinical disease, a marker of the innate antiviral response, or associated significantly with a unique respiratory virus infection.16 In the murine model of RSV for instance, NO production in the lungs appears to be associated with viral clearance and lung disease.17 Induced NO synthase activity and production of NO were associated with enhanced clearance of RSV, yet they were also associated with airway inflammatory changes and airway dysfunction.17 In murine studies of experimental influenza A\u2013triggered pneumonia, excessive NO biosynthesis, as measured by its metabolites nitrate and nitrite (collectively referred to NOx), was demonstrated in the lungs.18, 19 This suggested that the metabolites may be markers of influenza-mediated disease in the respiratory tract.",

Overall, our data suggested that concentration of NO-derived nitrate in nasal secretions in children in the ED may be related to type of viral pathogen causative for ILI: RSV subtype B\u2013associated ILI had higher nasal wash nitrate compared with all other viruses combined (P = .002).8 Ongoing studies will determine the predictive potential of this putative biomarker for important disease outcomes in sicker patients. Exhaled NO has also been studied as a putative biomarker for respiratory infections caused by influenza, rhinovirus, and other viral pathogens, but the data have been equivocal.26, 27 The conflicting data above may simply reflect technical issues in measuring exhaled NO. This methodology is cumbersome to achieve in the pediatric population, either for inpatients or in the ED. The newer NIOX-MINO (Aerocrine, Morrisville, NC) handheld NO detector has proven to be as reliable as the older, stationary chemiluminescence analyzer, the Ecomedics (ECO MEDICS, Duernten, Switzerland).28 Its portability may make it easier to handle in the ED setting. Focusing on stable NO metabolites in nasal secretions from patients with ILI in the ED may still be the better approach because of ready accessibility. Future studies are needed that can establish correlations between nasal secretion NOx and exhaled NO for ILI-type disease processes in the ED. A major benefit of working with respiratory tract\u2013based biomarkers, either in exhaled breath or via biochemical analyses of nasal secretions, is the independence from a blood collection in the ED.",

Cerebrospinal fluid ApoE levels were significantly increased in patients with bacterial meningitis when compared with healthy controls (sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 100% for CSF values vs sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 93% in serum).31 Although the collection of both CSF and serum is invasive, if such high measures of validity can be replicated consistently, ApoE has potential as a prominent diagnostic biomarker for bacterial meningitis.",

Several studies have implicated the overproduction of NO as the cause for the decompensated state.34 Sepsis, septic shock, and systemic inflammatory response syndrome in intensive care settings are associated with increased plasma levels of NOx.36, 37, 38 Measuring both plasma and urinary NOx has revealed elevations in patients with sepsis and septic shock.34 This may be caused by an elevated innate immune response to infection and inflammation, particularly in sepsis and shock. Such a response is associated with increased activity of induced NO synthase and thus more NO being released.39, 40 Urinary NOx, primarily nitrate, reflects both the production and use of NO.41, 42, 43 Sepsis and shock can expose the kidney to ischemic injury, which can be reflected in low levels of urinary NOx excretion likely caused by low endogenous NO generation.44, 45 Conversely, because most (96%) of filtered nitrate and nitrite is reabsorbed by the renal tubules, high levels in urine secondary to reduced renal reabsorption may reflect acute renal failure concomitant with sepsis/septic shock.44, 46\n",
