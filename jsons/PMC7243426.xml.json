For\nsmaller droplets (aerosols), the electrostatic attraction becomes the most efficient\nfiltering mechanism, where charged fibers attract the fine particles and get attached to\nthem.24 Nevertheless, these mechanisms take place in depth filters\nconsisting of a mesh of fibers where the pore sizes are always larger than the fine particle\nsizes. Thus, air velocity plays a key role in the efficiency of the filter, with higher\nvelocities reducing the filtration efficiency. However, the proposed filter is based on a\nmembrane where the main filtering mechanism is straining. In this case, filtration occurs\nbecause the size of the pores is smaller than the size of the particles, so the efficiency\nof the filter does not depend on the air velocity. Therefore, it is necessary to customize\nthe pore dimensions based on the particles to be removed; for instance, the pore size should\nbe below 60 nm if the droplet containing the COVID-19 virus has a size >60 nm.",

According to the United States National Institute for Occupational Safety and\nHealth (NIOSH), the airflow rate through a mask should be >85 L/min, which corresponds to\na moderately high work rate.25 In addition, according to NIOSH, a\ncertified N95 mask should not show a pressure drop above 343.2 Pa during inhalation and\n245.1 Pa during exhalation when tested using an airflow rate of 85 L/min. A higher pressure\ndrop means that a higher airflow resistance would be experienced, which degrades the\nbreathability of the mask. Therefore, in order to assess the performance of the membrane, we\ncalculated the airflow rate through the pores assuming a maximum pressure drop of 345\nPa.25 We also analyzed the effects of the pores size, density, membrane\nthickness, and pressure drop on the airflow rate. To simply the calculation, we assumed the\nshape of the pore to be circular because the pore size is in the nanoscale range. Moreover,\nwe assumed the flow to be laminar with negligible effects of friction. We estimated the air\nmean velocity Um using eq 1 and extracted the airflow rate Q using eq 2:12where\nUm is the air mean velocity (m/s),\ndp is the pore diameter (m), \u0394P is the\npressure gradient across the mask (Pa), h is the pore length (m), \u03b7\nis the dynamic viscosity of air (Pa\u00b7s), m is the number of pores,\nA is the area of the mask (m2), and Q is the\nvolumetric flow rate of air through the pores (m3/s).26",

It is also worth noting that for\npores with a size of 60 nm (smaller than the size of the COVID-19), a maximum spacing of\n\u223c330 is needed to achieve good breathability (85 L/min). This spacing is possible\nusing state-of-the-art lithography tools based on EUV and DUV. However, when using cheaper\nproximity photolithography tools, which have a resolution of \u223c1 \u03bcm, multiple\npatterning of the membrane would be necessary to increase its porosity (Figure 6B). If the patterned squares on the Si template are 1\n\u03bcm by 1 \u03bcm, then the spacing between the nanopores would be >1 \u03bcm. The\nthickness of the PI-based membrane can also be customized by spin-coating it at a higher\nspeed to achieve a thinner membrane with enhanced breathability (Figure\n6C). In addition, the membrane enables breathability across a\nwide range of pressure drops (Figure 6D). In all of\nthese cases, an increased airflow rate does not affect the filtration efficiency if the\nmembrane pore size is smaller than the COVD-19 size as a result of the straining\nmechanism.27 When the pore size of the filter is larger than the\nparticle size (as in the case of an N95 mask with 300 nm pores), then an increased air flow\nrate has been shown to reduce the filtration efficiency.28",

The rolling of droplets on inclined hydrophobic surfaces has been studied\nextensively in the past, both experimentally and using simulations, for applications in\nself-cleaning. As the inclination angle is increased and the droplet size is reduced, the\nrotational speed of the droplet increases, making the antifouling process\nfaster.31\u221233 Finally, the\nhydrophobicity of PI might be useful in repelling water droplets, which are the carriers of\nthe novel coronavirus.",

The\nflexible membrane could be used on a reusable N95 mask to enhance its filtering efficiency\nagainst sub-300 nm particles, including the COVID-19 virus. Moreover, the reusability of the\nN95 mask contributes toward relieving the challenges arising from the shortage of single-use\nface masks. The filtration mechanism is based on straining, with pores that are smaller than\nthe virus particles. Theoretical calculations on the airflow rate show that the membrane is\nbreathable over a wide range of pore sizes, densities, membrane thicknesses, and pressure\ndrops. Multiple patterning steps can be performed on the membrane to increase its porosity\nand to increase the allowable airflow rate through it without affecting its filtration\nefficiency. Finally, the membrane is based on a naturally hydrophobic polymer which\ncontributes to self-cleaning as a result of the rolling of the droplets on the inclined\nsurface.",
