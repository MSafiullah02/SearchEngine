Although the origin of PIV5 is unclear, PIV5 is thought to be able to infect humans and animals including dogs, pigs, cats, hamsters, guinea pigs, cattle, and panda.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 Parainfluenza virus 5 was first isolated as a contaminant from simian cells in 1956, and thus named simian virus 5.7 However, there is no sufficient evidence from subsequent studies indicating that PIV5 is a simian virus. Therefore, the virus was subsequently renamed PIV5 by International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses in 2009. Notably, PIV5 was renamed in 2016 to mammalian rubulavirus 5, but the name, \u201cPIV5,\u201d will be used in this review.8\n",

They have become powerful tools in basic virus research and translational research, including their use as vaccine vectors for prevention of infectious diseases and delivery vectors for gene therapy. In the past decades, NNSV members including Sendai virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, NDV, and RABV have been extensively explored for these applications.18, 19, 20, 21 Parainfluenza virus 5 has also emerged as a novel and attractive vector in vaccine studies. Parainfluenza virus 5 is an NNSV member that infects host respiratory epithelium, making it an attractive vector for developing live\u2010vectored vaccines that induce protective mucosal immune responses. So far, a number of PIV5\u2010based vaccine candidates have been successful in protecting against viral and bacterial infections in multiple animal models, suggesting that PIV5 vector is highly worthy of further exploration in the field of vaccine research. This is the first review of PIV5\u2010vectored vaccines against human and animal infectious diseases (Table 1), along with discussion of the advantages of the PIV5 vaccine vector platform to aid future vaccine design and to accelerate progression of PIV5\u2010based vaccines into clinical trials.",

            "text": "The reverse genetics system to rescue PIV5 was first established in 1997.24 The virus is rescued from a cloned cDNA that contains the full genome sequence in the positive\u2010sense orientation flanked by a T7 promoter and hepatitis delta virus ribozyme. To rescue PIV5, cells are infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing T7 RNA polymerase (vTF7.3) and then transfected with the PIV5 molecular clone along with helper plasmids encoding NP, P, and L genes. Viral RNA synthesized by T7 RNA polymerase is encapsidated with NP and associates with the polymerase complex, composed of P and L. The polymerase complex transcribes and replicates the genome, and progeny virions are produced. Rescued PIV5 is then filtered through a 0.45\u2010\u03bcM filter to remove the vaccinia virus. To avoid cell damage caused by vaccinia virus infection and for biosafety purposes, alternative PIV5 rescue approaches have been developed that do not require vaccinia virus. For example, a Baby Hamster Kidney Fibroblast (BHK)\u2010derived cell line that constitutively expresses T7 RNA polymerase (BSR\u2010T7/5) can be used in place of vTF7.3\u2010infected cells.25 Another approach, which we prefer to use in our laboratory, involves construction of a eukaryotic plasmid expressing T7 RNA polymerase that is cotransfected with the PIV5 infectious clone plasmid and NP, P, L\u2010encoding plasmids (Figure 1C). This method has the added benefit of enabling virus rescue in multiple cell lines. This flexibility is important when there are special requirements for virus stock production. The recombinant PIV5 viruses can be rescued efficiently from both approaches and directly used in further research without the need to remove vaccinia virus.",

            "text": "When rescuing recombinant PIV5 viruses expressing foreign genes using the reverse genetics system, it is critical to insert the foreign genes into PIV5 genome strategically. Generally, the foreign genes are inserted into PIV5 noncoding region as an additional transcriptional unit, including the GS sequence, the foreign gene, and the GE sequence. In our laboratory, the foreign gene is routinely inserted between the 3\u2032 end of upstream gene and the gene junction sequences. Using this strategy, one only needs to artificially insert a gene junction sequence between 3\u2032 end of upstream gene and foreign gene. The transcription of original upstream and downstream genes remains active, and the foreign gene transcriptional unit is functional in gene expression. As mentioned previously, the genome sequence of the recombinant PIV5 genome should adhere to the \u201crule of six,\u201d which enables proper genome encapsidation and thereby maintains the integrity of the genome and efficient virus replication. The insertion site is another important factor to consider, because it impacts the foreign gene expression level and viral replication efficiency. In principle, the foreign gene is more abundantly expressed when it is closer to the 3\u2032 end of the virus genome. In the case of NDV expression vector, insertion of the foreign gene at the P/M intergenic site of virus genome is preferable for optimal foreign gene expression.26, 27 An ideal insertion site for the foreign gene should balance virus replication and foreign gene expression and contain an optimized arrangement of gene junction sequences before and after the foreign gene.",

            "text": "Parainfluenza virus 5 is a good candidate for the development of viral vectored vaccines because of its safety, genomic stability, and abilities to grow in multiple cell lines and accommodate foreign genes of various sizes. (1) Parainfluenza virus 5 does not have a DNA phase in the life cycle, thereby avoiding the risk of genetic modification of host cell DNA by recombination or insertion. Furthermore, although PIV5 can infect many animal species, there is thus far no sufficient evidence indicating that PIV5 causes disease in any animal species or even in humans. Therefore, the PIV5 is thought to be a relatively safe vaccine vector, which is advantageous over other negative\u2010sense single\u2010stranded virus vectors developed from RABV, vesicular stomatitis virus, and NDV,27, 28, 29, 30, 31which encounter issues with virus reversion, residual virulence, etc. (2) The PIV5 genome harboring a foreign gene is relatively stable. It does not have issues with genome recombination and the loss of the foreign gene as frequently happens with positive\u2010stand RNA virus genomes.32, 33 Remarkably, PIV5 maintained expression of the GFP gene for over 10 generations in cell culture.24 In addition, PIV5 stably retained foreign genes from RSV34 after in vitro and in vivo passage. (3) Parainfluenza virus 5 infects a wide range of cell types, including primary human cells and established human cell lines. Parainfluenza virus 5 also infects a large number of mammals without causing any illness.2, 35, 36 Vero cells, a WHO\u2010approved cell line for vaccine production, is an ideal cell substrate for propagating PIV5, with viral titers up to 8 \u00d7 108 PFU/mL.37 Parainfluenza virus 5\u2032s ability to grow to such high titers makes it amenable to developing a mass\u2010produced, cost\u2010effective vaccine. Furthermore, PIV5 replication in the respiratory tract of animals offers an attractive route to deliver the vaccines where mucosal immunity is important for protection against pathogen infection. (4) Parainfluenza virus 5 virions are highly pleomorphic, with sizes ranging from 100 to 200 nm in diameter (Figure 1A). This structural versatility allows the PIV5 genome to accommodate foreign genes of various sizes, which is advantageous when using it as a vaccine vector. The maximum size for a gene inserted into PIV5 is unclear, but studies have shown that inserting genes 1500 to 2500 nt in length do not significantly affect PIV5 growth or virion integrity (unpublished data). Thus, the size of the PIV5 genome may not be tightly restricted by the virion structure.",

This was the first proof\u2010of\u2010concept study confirming that the PIV5 could be used for foreign gene expression. The feasibility of using recombinant PIV5 as a vaccine vector has since been tested. The first example is expression of the HA gene of influenza A/Udorn/72 (H3N2 subtype) virus at the gene junction between the HN and L genes of PIV5 (rPIV5\u2010H3).38 Interestingly, the HA was not only expressed in the virus\u2010infected cells but also incorporated into the rPIV5\u2010H3 virions. Infection and replication of rPIV5\u2010H3 in mice did not cause any clinical signs of disease or weight loss when compared to PBS\u2010treated mice. A single dose of rPIV5\u2010H3 by intranasal vaccination provided protective immunity to mice against influenza virus infection. This was the first study demonstrating that PIV5 could be used as a vector to provide protective immunity against influenza virus infection. Influenza virus HA protein incorporation into rPIV5\u2010H3 particles is thought to enhance HA\u2010specific immune responses by functioning as a virus\u2010like particle. When PIV5 delivers the envelope proteins of other viral pathogens, they may be presented on the surface of virus particles and enhance immune responses.

Fifty percent of the PIV5\u2010G\u2013treated mice survived, even after the onset of clinical signs on day 6 post\u2010RABV infection. PIV5\u2010G was as effective as LBNSE\u2013GM\u2010CSF in treating RABV\u2010infected mice. To improve the efficacy of PIV5\u2010G, a combined therapy of PIV5\u2010G and anti\u2010rabies antibodies is worthy of further investigation. Unlike an attenuated RABV vaccine, PIV5\u2010G will not be neutralized by anti\u2010rabies antibodies. The attenuated RABV vaccine also has safety concerns when injected into the human brain.",

Thus far, there is no licensed RSV vaccine, and a safe and efficacious RSV vaccine remains an unmet need. Two PIV5\u2010vectored vaccines expressing RSV glycoproteins F (PIV5/F) and G (PIV5/G) were evaluated in animal models for their immunogenicity and efficacy of protection against RSV infection.52 First, PIV5/F and PIV5/G were examined in mice for proof\u2010of\u2010concept testing. It was found that serum neutralizing antibodies were generated in PIV5/F\u2010immunized mice but not in PIV5/G\u2010immunized mice. Despite this, reduced viral burden was found in the lungs of PIV5/G\u2010immunized mice presumably because RSV G\u2010specific antibodies are protective independent of conventional neutralization activity in vitro. This work demonstrated that a single\u2010dose immunization with PIV5/F or PIV5/G elicited protective immunity against RSV challenge in mice. PIV5/F and PIV5/G were further evaluated as single\u2010dose inoculations in more relevant preclinical animal models.53 In cotton rats, both PIV5/F and PIV5/G elicited RSV\u2010specific serum antibodies and conferred complete protection in the lung against RSV challenge. In African green monkeys, PIV5/F conferred the greatest reduction in post\u2010challenge RSV titers in the respiratory tract, while PIV5/G was relatively less efficacious. The PIV5 vaccines were also able to boost RSV neutralizing antibody responses in African green monkeys with prior exposure to RSV. These studies demonstrate that the PIV5 is a promising vaccine vector for RSV\u2010na\u00efve and RSV\u2010exposed persons (pediatric and elderly) against RSV infection, with PIV5/F as a superior RSV vaccine candidate.",

If humans or animals have preexisting immunity (especially neutralizing antibodies) to viral vectors, it will theoretically inhibit virus entry into host cells, thereby reducing the dose and antigenicity of vectored antigens.56 To determine if the presence of preexisting immunity is detrimental to the efficacy of a PIV5\u2010vectored vaccine, dogs with prior exposure to PIV5 were inoculated with PIV5\u2010H3, and efficacy of PIV5\u2010H3 (HA of influenza virus subtype H3) was measured.16 Dogs seroconverted 2 weeks postinoculation, and the hemaggluitination inhibition antibody titers against an H3N2 virus were greater than 40, which is considered protective in immunological standards, by 3 weeks postinoculation. These results indicate that prior exposure to PIV5 does not prevent a PIV5\u2010vectored vaccine from generating protective immunity. These results are consistent with the previous findings that anti\u2010PIV5 antibodies do not prevent PIV5 infection in mice.57 The exposure of PIV5 in human populations has also been investigated. Neutralizing antibodies against PIV5 were detected in 29% of human serum samples, but the titers were lower than those in dogs with prior exposure to PIV5.16 These results suggest that PIV5 vaccines may be able to overcome preexisting immunity to induce immunogenic and protective immune responses against pathogen infections in humans.",

As previously discussed, PIV5 vector is able to induce strong humoral immunity and protection for a variety of vaccine targets. Induction of cellular immunity is also critical for protection against some pathogens, but the induction of cellular immunity by PIV5 has not been investigated in depth. The ability of PIV5 to induce a cellular immune response was tested using PIV5 expressing a model antigen, chicken ovalbumin. In this experiment, mice were inoculated intranasally and T\u2010cell responses were assessed.60 Vaccination elicited a strong and long\u2010lasting cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response with high avidity against ovalbumin. This result suggests that PIV5 is a good vaccine vector for viral antigens, since a high avidity CTL response is optimal for virus clearance.61 Since PIV5 replication primarily occurs in the respiratory tract, this quality makes it an attractive vaccine vector for generating high avidity CTL responses against respiratory or mucosal pathogen infection.",

The use of PIV5 as a vector appears to pose no major risk to animal and human health because there is no concern of virulence reversion, residual virulence, or virus recombination.
