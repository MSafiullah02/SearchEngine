Santos gratefully acknowledges financial support from of a group of climate scientists that should advise the European Union about the best policy in order to fight CO 2 emissions. Another concrete and recent example may be the one of epidemiologists advising a prime minister about the best policy to fight the Coronavirus outbreak in 2020. In both cases, it is reasonable to think that different experts assign different probability distributions to possible scenarios. For instance, in the beginning of March 2020, due to the lack of data and high uncertainty about the number of infected people, some epidemiologists may have assigned a high probability to a pandemic scenario with several hundred thousand of contaminated people by the Coronavirus in all Europe, while at the same time others may have thought that such a scenario was not as likely to happen.",

If all experts think that f is better than g, 1 then it may be reasonable for the DM to prefer policy f rather than g. This decision rule is sometimes referred to as unanimity principle. Note that all experts in the group have a veto power: it is sufficient that one expert ranks g above f to break unanimity. Suppose that this is indeed the case and that experts disagree. Then it is not clear which policy the DM should implement. In this situation, especially when uncertainty about different scenarios is high and there are scenarios that can lead to catastrophes, several authors suggest to adopt the precautionary principle. While there is not an accepted and universal definition of the precautionary principle, see Gardiner [14] , one can think of it as saying that a policy should be evaluated through the opinion of the most pessimistic expert.",

These axioms are imposed on two Bewley preference relations, * and * * (and on their generalized Bayesian updates * E and * * E ), that correspond to the original and to the enlarged group of experts respectively. Coherence is divided into two parts: Ex-Ante and Ex-Post Coherence. Ex-Ante Coherence says, loosely speaking, that the (new) unconditional preference * * should agree with * on the likelihood of events in the information partition. Ex-Post Coherence states that the (new) updated preference * * E should agree with * E . Therefore Coherence imposes some restrictions on how new experts should be chosen. Prudence simply asserts that the novel unanimity rule will never reveal a ranking that is not supported by the original criteria. For the representation it implies that the new set of probability measures should contain the original one. It means that we may observe new experts added to the original group and all experts that were already there will still have veto power.",

We call * * the coherent precautionary restriction of * . On the one hand, extending the set of probabilities means that more opinions are taken into account. On the other hand, it implies that it is more likely that two experts disagree on the ranking of a pair of acts. Our point here is that the decrease of comparable acts (i.e. increasing incompleteness of preferences) is consistent with a DM whose behavior is driven by uncertainty aversion and regret aver-sion. Note that an alternative way to solve both the problems of incompleteness and time inconsistency is to pick only one expert out of the group. Since it seems that there is not an objective procedure to select the \"best expert\", it seems reasonable for a DM to opt for a plurality of opinions.",

As a corollary, a simple application of GMMS allows us to obtain a dynamic consistent Maxmin preference as a completion of * * . 2 Our results can be interpreted in the following way: if a set of expert is not rectangular and if one is willing to safely (i.e. without generating dynamic inconsistent decisions) complete the unanimity rule by the precautionary principle, then this set should be enlarged through a \"rectangularization\"\u00e0 la Sarin and Wakker [23] and Epstein and Schneider [9] .

Moreover, one can notice that acts f \u2032 and g are not ambiguous with respect to the probability set C, meaning that u(f )dP = u(f )dQ for all P, Q \u2208 C. This happens because the events R and BG are not ambiguous. Clearly, if # denotes a Maxmin preference represented by the same pair (u, C), one obtains g \u227b # f \u2032 . However, if the information partition is P = {G, RB} there is an increase in ambiguity since P is not aligned with the ex-ante structure of information given by C. Note actually that f \u2032 and g are not comparable with respect to * RB and moreover one has f \u2032 \u227b # RB g, where * RB and # RB are the ex-post Bewley and Maxmin preferences represented both by (u, C RB ), and C RB is as in Example 1. This violates Dynamic Consistency. Ghirardato et al. [17] note \"Yet, it seems to us that a decision maker with the ambiguity averse preferences [f \u227b g \u227b f \u2032 ] might still prefer to bet on a red ball being extracted, finding that event less ambiguous than the extraction of a [blue] ball, and that constraining him to choose otherwise is imposing a strong constraint on the dynamics of his ambiguity attitude. In view of this example, we claim that dynamic consistency is a compelling property only for comparisons of acts that are not affected by the possible presence of ambiguity. In other words, we think that rankings of acts unaffected by ambiguity should be dynamically consistent.\"",

In order to obtain Dynamic Consistency of the (uncertainty averse) subjectively rational preference, Corollary 1 says that the coherent precautionary restriction * * of * should be computed. Acts f \u2032 and g are not comparable with respect to * * , as for instance g is ranked higher than f \u2032 for the probability ( 1 9 , 2 9 , 6 9 ) \u2208 r P (C) (take p = 1 3 and t = 1 3 ) and f \u2032 is ranked higher than g for the probability (1, 0, 0) \u2208 r P (C) (take p = 1 and t = 1). When the completion ## (a Maxmin preference represented by (u, r P (C))) is used, we obtain f \u2032 \u227b ## g. The ex-ante ranking is therefore reversed in a way that reflects the increase in ambiguity. This implies no violations of Dynamic Consistency.",
