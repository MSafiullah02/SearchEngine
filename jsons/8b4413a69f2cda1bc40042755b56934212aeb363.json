This shortage has led to an increase in the prevalence of falsified alcohol-based hand sanitizers, including the illegal addition of methanol to hand sanitizers and the production of hand sanitizers with an alcohol concentration of less than 60%. These findings indicate that regulatory and public health bodies should take an active role in ensuring the safety and quality of antimicrobial products such as alcohol-based hand sanitizers at every stage of the products' lifecycle, including distribution, manufacture and import.",

In mid-March 2020, the disease's spread across the globe was such that the World Health Organization (WHO) officially labelled the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. 2 To control the spread of the virus, it is essential to implement strict preventative measures, including repeated hand-washing with water and soap.",

Made with n-propyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethanol, or a combination of alcohol types, these sanitizers are also less irritating to the skin and can be applied quickly. 3, 5 Given the popularity of hand sanitizers and their importance in preventing the spread of COVID-19, falsified alcohol-based sanitizers pose a significant public health risk.",

First, methanol should not be used in hand sanitizers because it is highly toxic and can cause severe reactions when exposed to the skin, lungs or mouth. 7 Exposure to methanol can result in systemic toxicity and, in some cases, death. [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] The substance's elevated intrinsic toxicity, its ready availability and its widespread use make poisoning from undeclared methanol in hand sanitisers an important public health concern. 15 Second, a hand sanitizer that contains less than 60% alcohol would be ineffective as a germicide and offer users no biocidal effect, leaving the public vulnerable to contracting and spreading COVID-19.",

The popularity of alcohol-based sanitizers in healthcare and community settings coupled with the risk of methanol poisoning and ineffective hand antisepsis posed by falsified sanitizers demands a response.
