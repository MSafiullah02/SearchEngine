            "text": "At present, 588 human proteases are listed in the degradome database (Quesada et al. 2009), which can be further divided into five classes based on their catalytic mechanism. The majority belongs to the family of metallo (192 members), serine (184 enzymes), and cysteine proteases (164 members); in addition, 27 threonine and 21 aspartyl proteases are known, so far. Proteases are well-druggable targets and numerous small-molecule protease inhibitors have been approved in the past. The more than ten inhibitors of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) (Turk 2006), as well as the neprilysin (enkephalinase) inhibitor prodrugs sacubitril (Howell and Cameron 2016) and racecadotril (acetorphan) target Zn2+-dependent metalloproteases. The ACE blockers and sacubitril are suitable for long-term usage as antihypertensive drugs, whereas racecadotril is approved as an antidiarrheal drug. Despite limited use, treatment of high blood pressure is also possible with aliskiren, a small-molecule inhibitor of the aspartate protease renin (Wood et al. 2003). Numerous synthetic inhibitors of the trypsin-like serine proteases (TLSP) thrombin (argatroban, dabigatran etexilate, bivalirudin) and factor Xa (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, betrixaban) can be used as anticoagulants (Straub et al. 2011). Except argatroban and bivalirudin, all of these clotting protease inhibitors are orally available and suited for long-term use in the prevention of stroke, e.g., in patients suffering from atrial fibrillation. Meanwhile, more than ten gliptins have been approved in various countries. The gliptins are a class of oral hypoglycemic drugs for the treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2 targeting the serine protease dipeptidyl peptidase 4, thereby reducing the degradation of incretin hormones leading to an enhanced insulin secretion (Scheen 2015). The proteasome inhibitors bortezomib (Adams 2004) and carfilzomib (Kortuem and Stewart 2013) are used in patients with multiple myeloma and the first approved drugs targeting threonine proteases. Meanwhile, two additional proteasome inhibitors, ixazomib and oprozomib, obtained orphan drug status (Manasanch and Orlowski 2017). Besides addressing human proteases, numerous inhibitors of the aspartyl protease of HIV (Ghosh et al. 2016) and the NS3/4A serine protease of the hepatitis C virus (McCauley and Rudd 2016) are on the market. With few exceptions, most of these inhibitors are routinely used in combination with other drugs and not as single agents. Despite large efforts, no cysteine protease inhibitor has been approved, so far. One of the most advanced inhibitors of the papain-like bone-degrading protease cathepsin K is the nitrile derivative odanacatib, which was developed for the treatment of osteoporosis. Based on a clinical phase III trial, a high efficacy with increasing bone mineral density and reduced risk of fractures was initially reported, as well as a good safety profile (Chapurlat 2015). However, its further development was stopped at the end of 2016 due to a slightly increased risk of stroke (Mullard 2016). Other cathepsin K inhibitors, like the nitrile balicatib, failed in phase II due to complications with skin fibrosis (Br\u00f6mme et al. 2016; Runger et al. 2012). Despite the lack of approved cysteine protease inhibitors, many other examples confirm the suitability of at least some proteases as excellent drug targets.",

The inhibition of host enzymes could be advantageous compared to the classical addressing of viral targets due to a low risk for rapid drug resistances. However, side effects may occur by targeting host enzymes, which are required for normal physiological processes. Moreover, most host proteases belong to families of structurally closely related enzymes, and therefore it might be challenging to address a single target without affecting other family members. In order to avoid side effects and a narrow therapeutic window, it is therefore advisable to develop such host protease inhibitors mainly for combination therapies, which should enable the use of lower drug doses.",

As nonhuman protein, it may cause hypersensitive reactions during cardiac surgery, although the risk for anaphylactic reactions at first-time exposure is very low (<0.1%) but might increase to ~2.7% after reexposure (Levy and Adkinson 2008). However, the application of aprotinin against influenza in form of an aerosol at significantly lower doses should minimize side effects (Zhirnov et al. 2011). In addition, an aprotinin variant with stronger kallikrein and similar plasmin inhibition has been developed, which exhibits a reduced immunogenicity in chimpanzees (Apeler et al. 2004). Antiviral potency against influenza was recently also demonstrated with the endogenous proteinaceous inhibitor hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor 2 (HAI-2) (Hamilton et al. 2014). HAI-2 and HAI-1 are type 1 transmembrane proteins both containing two Kunitz domains, which inhibit numerous trypsin-like serine proteases including hepatocyte growth factor activator, matriptase (Szabo et al. 2008), hepsin, trypsin, and prostasin (Liu et al. 2017). Sunflower trypsin inhibitor SFTI-1 (2), a bicyclic 14-mer, provides also an excellent scaffold for the design of serine protease inhibitors (Luckett et al. 1999) (Fig. 11.2).\n",

Despite this limitation, an aerosol formulation of aprotinin has been developed and approved in Russia for the treatment of mild-to-moderate influenza infections (Zhirnov et al. 2011). It was described that in case of mammalian IAV and LPAIV with monobasic HAs, progeny particles are assembled, which still contain some uncleaved HAs and therefore require further activation by extracellular enzymes sensitive to aprotinin. In contrast to these previous reports, more recent findings reveal that the monobasic HAs are processed in intracellular compartments without a further need for extracellular processing (B\u00f6ttcher-Friebertsh\u00e4user et al. 2010, 2013). This suggests that small amounts of aprotinin can reach intracellular targets and achieve an antiviral efficacy (Zhirnov et al. 2011).",

            "text": "Although the therapeutic use of peptide drugs (Vlieghe et al. 2010) and biologics including recombinant enzymes, hormones, and antibodies is steadily increasing and meanwhile well established, a treatment with synthetic, small-molecule drugs offers significant advantages. They can be produced at low costs in large quantities and offer the possibility for oral administration with a negligible risk of allergic reactions. In initial studies a weak antiviral effect after treatment with ECA (5, \u03b5-aminocaproic acid, Fig. 11.4) was observed in mice infected by IAV including the plasmin-dependent WSN strain (Zhirnov et al. 1982a, b). Due to its small size, ECA (5) cannot bind efficiently to the active site of trypsin-like proteases and reduces mainly the activation of plasminogen by blocking the lysine binding site on the kringle domains of plasminogen (Al-Horani and Desai 2014). A pronounced protective effect was also observed, when IAV-infected mice were treated with a cocktail of 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonylfluoride (6, AEBSF or Pefabloc\u00aeSC) and p-aminobenzamidine (7, p-AB) prior to infection. Both compounds are relatively unspecific protease inhibitors and can only occupy the S1 pocket of trypsin-like serine proteases. AEBSF 6 leads to a covalent sulfonylation of the active-site Ser195 side chain (second-order inactivation constant k\n2/K\ni for trypsin 30 M\u22121 s\u22121), while p-AB acts as a reversible competitive inhibitor with K\ni values in the two- and three-digit micromolar range depending on the specific target (St\u00fcrzebecher et al. 2001). Although AEBSF 6 is more stable in buffer than the related phenylmethane sulfonylfluoride (PMSF), it is also susceptible\nto hydrolysis in aqueous media (Powers et al. 2002) and not suitable for further development. Derivatives of the classical active-site titrant p-nitrophenyl-p-guanidinobenzoate (Chase and Shaw 1967) including compounds like camostat 8 (FOY-305) and nafamostat 9 (FUT-175) (Fujii and Hitomi 1981) inhibit numerous trypsin-like serine proteases by covalent acylation of their active-site Ser195, providing relatively stable acyl-enzyme complexes. These compounds are active against numerous monobasic IAV and IBV strains (Hosoya et al. 1993; Lee et al. 1996; Someya et al. 1990) but suffer from instability of their ester bond in aqueous media and the circulation (t\u00bd <1 min after intravenous application of camostat in man (Midgley et al. 1994)). A very short half-life is also reported for nafamostat, although this could be an advantage for certain applications. Notably, nafamostat has been widely used as anticoagulant for hemodialysis patients with a tendency to bleed (Han et al. 2011).\n",

            "text": "A well-suited P1 mimetic to target trypsin- and furin-like PCs is the 4-amidinobenzylamide group (4-Amba). The 4-Amba anchor makes numerous polar interactions to residues at the bottom and exit of the\nS1 pocket (Fig. 11.5) but exhibits no preference for special trypsin-like serine proteases. Within this inhibitor type, an improved selectivity for individual family members can partially achieved only via their P2, P3, and/or P4 residues. All substrate analogue structures strictly require a P2 amino acid in l-configuration, whereas a d-configured P3-residue is often preferred. Its side chain can address the characteristic distal S3/4 binding pocket above Trp215, which is found and mostly well-defined in all trypsin-like serine proteases. In contrast, the side chain of a natural l-configured P3 residue is directed toward the solvent and makes fewer binding contributions. Interestingly, the backbone of the P3 residue is involved in a short antiparallel \u03b2-sheet interaction with a highly conserved glycine in position 216 of the protease domain, irrespective of an l- or d-configuration of the P3 amino acid. So far, no crystal structures of TTSPs involved in HA cleavage, like TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4, or HAT, are available. However, countless crystal structures of this inhibitor type in complex with numerous other trypsin-like serine proteases have been elucidated. As an example, Fig. 11.5 shows the binding mode of the substrate analogue inhibitor H-d-hTyr-Ala-4-Amba (10) (Fig. 11.6) in complex with trypsin, indicating the characteristic binding pockets (Maiwald et al. 2016). This inhibitor type could be refined following a well-established prodrug strategy that has been used for the development of the orally available thrombin inhibitor ximelagatran (Gustafsson et al. 2004). The conversion of the P1-amidine (pK\na = 11.5) into a hydroxyamidine (pK\na = 5.2) reduces the strongly basic character of the 4-Amba group and improves the bioavailability of the inhibitors. An enzyme system found in the liver and other organs (kidney, lung, brain, and intestine) consisting of cytochrome b5, a NADH-dependent cytochrome b5 reductase, and a P450 enzyme is involved in the reduction of the N-hydroxylated compounds (Clement 2002).\n\n",

For inhibitors containing a d-configured P3 residue, the N-terminal coupling of a benzylsulfonyl group induces a turn-like inhibitor backbone conformation when bound to the target, in which the N-terminal benzyl group binds in a shallow subpocket adjacent to the S1 site and comes in close van der Waals contact to the P1 phenyl ring (Fig. 11.7) above the Cys191-Cys220 disulfide bridge. Inhibitor 11 is a somewhat selective fXa inhibitor (K\ni = 3.5 nM (Schweinitz et al. 2006)) due to the presence of glycine in P2 position but inhibits also trypsin and matriptase with inhibition constants of 10 nM and 130 nM, respectively.\n",

A significant antiviral effect was found in BAPA-treated cell cultures infected with numerous monobasic IAV strains (B\u00f6ttcher-Friebertsh\u00e4user et al. 2010, 2012; B\u00f6ttcher et al. 2009; Sielaff et al. 2011a). Many analogues of this inhibitor scaffold with different P2 and/or P3 residues have been tested but were less effective than BAPA (data not published). It seems that compounds with a broader target spectrum exhibit an advantageous antiviral profile. This tendency confirms the promising results obtained for the relatively nonselective inhibitor aprotinin. Otherwise, less selective inhibitors that also target numerous clotting proteases might suffer from a narrow safety profile due to potential bleeding complications after i.v. treatment. Such side effects might be reduced, when the compounds will be inhaled, as described for aprotinin. Notably, BAPA (12) was well tolerated in a bleomycin-induced fibrosis model in mice when it was applied as aerosol via a microsprayer (data not published).",

Numerous alternative P1 groups are known from the field of thrombin and fXa inhibitors (Straub et al. 2011). Besides basic groups, many chloro-substituted aromatic P1 residues as used, for example, in inhibitor 13 have been developed (Sisay et al. 2010). The chlorine addresses a highly conserved Tyr228 side chain found at the back of the S1 pocket, whereas the aminomethyl group comes out of the S1 pocket and does not bind to Asp189. It provides an enhanced inhibitory potency against thrombin and fXa but leads to a reduced inhibition of HAT, matriptase, plasmin, and of several other trypsin-like serine proteases.

            "text": "Another strategy is the design of covalent inhibitors (Singh et al. 2011). Covalent bonds can be irreversibly formed, e.g., when serine proteases are inactivated by chloromethyl ketones (CMK) (Powers et al. 2002). Although such CMKs are useful tools for initial biochemical experiments and structure analysis, they are not suitable for drug development due to stability and selectivity problems. A more eligible approach is the incorporation of electrophilic warheads, which also form covalent but reversible bonds to their targets. This can be achieved by coupling of substrate-analogue P3-P2 or P4-P2 segments with P1 boroarginine and arginal groups or with P1-P1\u2032-arginyl ketones. These electrophilic groups can be attacked by the active-site serine providing covalent boronate ester-, hemiacetal-, or hemiketal-like complexes. The formed covalent bond significantly improves the affinity of the inhibitors. In the 1990s, a few arginal and arginyl-ketone-derived thrombin inhibitors reached preclinical and early clinical development (Steinmetzer et al. 2001), which was stopped due to the discovery of more suited non-covalent inhibitors, like melagatran containing the 4-Amba residue. The arginal derivative 14 acylated with the N-terminal Abz-fluorophore\n(Fig. 11.8) was described as an inhibitor of HAT (K\ni = 54 nM) (Wysocka et al. 2010). CVS-3983 (15), a second aldehyde derivative containing an unusual dialkylated P3 residue, inhibits matriptase with an inhibition constant of 3.3 nM and reduced prostate cancer growth in a xenograft mice model (Galkin et al. 2004). However, none of these aldehydes was tested for antiviral potential. The reuse of reversible arginyl ketone inhibitors against TTSPs has started in 2012 with compound 16 (IN-1) (Fig. 11.8). Although it is a much stronger matriptase inhibitor (K\ni = 11 pM), it potently inhibits additional trypsin-like serine proteases like matriptase-2, hepsin, HAT, and trypsin with K\ni values <10 nM (Colombo et al. 2012). Compound 16 reduces breast cancer progression in mice (Zoratti et al. 2015) and inhibits H1N1 IAV propagation in human Calu-3 cells with an EC50 of 5.6 \u03bcM (Beaulieu et al. 2013). It was postulated that the antiviral efficacy is due to matriptase inhibition. However, since the inhibitor concentrations used were well above the K\ni values against related proteases, it is conceivable that the inhibition of additional targets contributes to the observed antiviral effects. Numerous analogues with modified P4-P2 peptide segments like compound 17 (K\ni value for matriptase 0.92 nM) targeting also matriptase-2, hepsin, and hepatocyte growth factor activator (HGFA) have been prepared for tumor treatment or regulation of iron overload but were not further tested with influenza viruses, so far (Duchene et al. 2014; Han et al. 2014, 2016).\n",

            "text": "Suitable scaffolds for non-covalent inhibitors of trypsin-like serine proteases are the tertiary amides of sulfonylated 3-amidinophenylalanines, which were originally developed for the inhibition of trypsin, thrombin, or uPA and further used for the design of matriptase inhibitors (Steinmetzer et al. 2006; St\u00fcrzebecher et al. 1997). With some exception, this class of compounds provides relatively broad-spectrum inhibitors targeting numerous trypsin-like serine proteases. The uPA inhibitor\n18 (St\u00fcrzebecher et al. 1999) (WX-UK1, Fig. 11.9) in combination with the 5-fluorouracil prodrug capecitabine reached clinical development for tumor therapy (Setyono-Han et al. 2005). Moreover, an orally available formulation in form of its hydroxyamidino prodrug mesupron (19) has also reached clinical phase II studies (indication pancreas and breast cancer). This suggests that this 3-amidinophenylalanine inhibitor type is suitable for drug development. Otherwise, compound 18 is only a moderate inhibitor of numerous trypsin-like serine proteases including matriptase with K\ni values close to 0.5 \u03bcM. Its sterically demanding and rigid triisopropyl-phenylsulfonyl (Tips) group cannot fully occupy the distal binding pocket above Trp215 in the usual way (Setyono-Han et al. 2005; St\u00fcrzebecher et al. 1999). A significantly improved and selective matriptase inhibition (K\ni = 3.8 nM) was achieved with inhibitor 20. Its N-terminal \u03b2-alanyl-amide targets the distal S3/4 pocket and is most likely involved in cation-\u03c0 interactions to Trp215 and Phe99 of matriptase (Steinmetzer et al. 2006). However, the tribasic and strongly polar character limits the membrane permeability and bioavailability of this compound. Therefore, the number of basic groups was stepwise reduced and provided compound 21 (MI-432) containing an N-terminal substituted biphenyl-3-sulfonyl group. This analogue inhibits matriptase and TMPRSS2 with similar inhibition constants of 2 nM and 0.9 nM, respectively (Hammami et al. 2012; Meyer et al. 2013). It is also a relatively potent thrombin inhibitor (K\ni = 20 nM) but poor inhibitor of HAT (K\ni = 1.7 \u03bcM). Replacement of its C-terminal amino group by an urea portion provided the monobasic analogue 22 (MI-462) (Hammami et al. 2012) (K\ni = 5.1 nM for matriptase and 630 nM for thrombin). Compounds 20\u201322 (Fig. 11.9) reduced the propagation of various LPAIV strains with monobasic HA cleavage sites in infected cells (Baron et al. 2013; Meyer et al. 2013). For instance, treatment\nwith 50 \u03bcM of compound 21 inhibited the multiple cycle replication of IAV H3N2 and H1N1 strains in Calu-3 cells (Meyer et al. 2013), in which TMPRSS2 was identified as the major HA-cleaving protease (B\u00f6ttcher-Friebertsh\u00e4user et al. 2011).\n",

Therefore, we have generated a homology model of TMPRSS2 in complex with inhibitor 21 using SWISS-MODEL (http://swissmodel.expasy.org/) (Biasini et al. 2014). The model was superimposed with the crystal structure of inhibitor 21 in complex with thrombin (PDB, 4E7R (Hammami et al. 2012)) and subsequent deletion of the thrombin structure. The inhibitor was energy minimized in the active site of TMPRSS2 using the software Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) (2016). The model shows the expected polar contacts known from numerous crystal structures of sulfonylated 3-amidinophenylalanines in complex with trypsin (Renatus et al. 1998), uPA (Zeslawska et al. 2000), and matriptase (Steinmetzer et al. 2006) (Fig. 11.10). The benzamidine binds to Asp189, Ser190, and Gly219 at the bottom of the S1 pocket, whereas the backbone amide NH and carbonyl oxygen of the P1 3-amidinophenylalanine make a short antiparallel \u03b2-sheet-like interaction with Gly216, and one sulfonyl oxygen binds to the NH of Gly219. It should be noted that in complexes with the substrate analogue inhibitors 10\u201317, this Gly216 is addressed by the backbone NH and carbonyl of the P3 residue, which indicates a completely different binding mode of this inhibitor type.\n",

Usually, they are more stable than peptidic inhibitors, possess longer half-lives, and offer better chances to be orally bioavailable. Hundreds of highly potent nonpeptidic inhibitors targeting the clotting proteases are available, whereas only few TTSP inhibitors of this type have been described, so far. Most of the work was done in the field of matriptase inhibitors (Fig. 11.11). The bis-benzamidine 23 has a K\ni value of 208 nM (Enyedy et al. 2001); and an enhanced potency (K\ni = 40 nM) was described for analogue 24 (Goswami et al. 2013). The tribasic compounds 25 and 26 show improved matriptase inhibition with K\ni values of 10 nM and 3 nM, respectively (Goswami et al. 2014). A less rigid core segment was used for the design of the tribasic inhibitor 27, which inhibits matriptase and matriptase-2 with K\ni values of 38 nM and 3.6 \u03bcM (Furtmann et al. 2016). A group from Korea reported the discovery of the 2-hydroxydiarylamide derivatives 28 and 29 as TMPRSS4 inhibitors with IC\n50 values of 12 \u03bcM and 6 \u03bcM (Kang et al. 2013), respectively.

            "text": "The spike (S) surface protein of respiratory coronaviruses (CoV)\nis also synthesized as inactive precursor protein that has to be activated by host proteases. The N-terminal S1 unit of the cleaved protein binds to receptors on host cells, and the C-terminal S2 unit enables the fusion of the viral membrane with host cell membranes. Both functions are essential for CoV propagation. Original studies suggested that the endosomal cysteine protease cathepsin L is solely required for spike activation and subsequent SARS-CoV infectivity (Simmons et al. 2005). Notably, a cathepsin dependency was also found for the enveloped Ebola virus of the Filoviridae family (Chandran et al. 2005) and Nipah virus (Diederich and Maisner 2007), as described above. Later, numerous groups have found that in the presence of cathepsin L inhibitors, the S-protein of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV is activated by TMPRSS2 (Gierer et al. 2013; Matsuyama et al. 2010; Shulla et al. 2011; Zmora et al. 2014). Consequently, inhibition of SARS-CoV growth in Calu-3 airway epithelial cells was achieved by a combination treatment with the broad-spectrum serine protease inhibitor camostat (8) (Fig. 11.4) and the cathepsin inhibitor (23,25) trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-3-methyl-butane ethyl ester (EST) (Kawase et al. 2012). Based on these observations, it is suggested that SARS-CoV enters the host cells via two distinct pathways, one using TTSPs like TMPRSS2 and a second using the endosomal cathepsins L and/or B for spike activation. Interestingly, a recent study with a fresh clinical isolate of the human CoV 229E revealed a clear preference for host cell entry via TMPRSS2, whereas after 20 passages in HeLa cells the cathepsin L pathway became more important (Shirato et al. 2017). However, the cell culture virus showed a reduced ability for replication suggesting that the endosomal pathway is disadvantageous for HCoV-229E infection in humans. Based on these results, the authors suggested to target TMPRSS2 rather than endosomal cathepsins in CoV infections (Shirato et al. 2017). A similar tendency was previously found in an animal model of SARS-CoV infection, where viral spread and pathogenesis were only prevented by the TLSP inhibitor camostat and not by broad-spectrum vinylsulfone-type cysteine protease inhibitors targeting cathepsins L and B (Zhou et al. 2015). However, the authors argue that their new vinylsulfone inhibitors might be excellent lead structures for the development of inhibitors of Ebola virus entry.\n",

It also inhibits PC1 (K\ni = 260 nM) and PC5 (K\ni = 2.3 nM) but has reduced potency against PC2, PC7, and PACE4 (K\ni >1000 nM). Its expression in cells blocked the processing of HIV gp160 as well as measles virus fusion protein and, thus, inhibited virus spread (Anderson et al. 1993; Watanabe et al. 1995). Based on the reactive loop of \u03b11-PDX, numerous mini-PDX peptides have been prepared. These acyclic- or disulfide-bridged cyclic 30-mers inhibit furin with IC\n50 values of 731 nM and 569 nM, respectively (Basak and Lotfipour 2005).",

Due to their relatively high molecular weight, negligible oral bioavailability, and stability problems, these compounds are not the first choice for drug development. Nevertheless, numerous injectable peptides are used in therapeutic applications (Vlieghe et al. 2010). The first potent PC inhibitors were the irreversible substrate analogue chloromethyl ketones (CMK), which covalently bind to the enzyme (Garten et al. 1989; Hallenberger et al. 1992). The most widely used basic PC inhibitor\nis the commercially available derivative Dec-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-CMK (31, Fig. 11.15), which targets all of the known furin-like PCs in the nanomolar range (Garten et al. 1994; Jean et al. 1998). In cell culture, it blocks the furin-catalyzed cleavage of HIV gp160 into gp120 and gp41. Furthermore, the first crystal structure of furin was obtained when it was complexed with this inhibitor (Henrich et al. 2003). However, CMKs are not suited for further development. In vivo studies with the thrombin inhibitor d-Phe-Pro-Arg-CMK revealed a very short half-life <5 min (Hanson and Harker 1988). The same P4-P1 segment of the CMK 31 served for the design of analogues containing pseudo peptide bonds, like the ketomethylene inhibitor 32 (K\ni value of 3.4 nM against furin, Fig. 11.15) (Angliker 1995).\n",

On the other hand, the unprotected analogue H-Leu-Leu-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-OH has a stronger furin affinity (0.42 \u03bcM) but reduced potency against PC2 (3.4 \u03bcM) (Cameron et al. 2000).",

            "text": "We have developed a new peptidomimetic lead structure for basic PCs by incorporation of decarboxylated arginine derivatives in P1 position. Starting from the agmatine compound Phac-Arg-Val-Arg-4-Agm (33, K\ni = 78 nM, Fig. 11.16) or the equipotent noragmatine analogue, the approximately 100-fold more potent 4-Amba inhibitor 34 has been prepared (Fig. 11.16). It inhibits furin with a K\ni value of 0.81 nM and PC1, PACE4, and PC5 with similar efficacy but has reduced potency against PC2 and PC7 (Becker et al. 2010) and negligible affinity against the trypsin-like serine proteases thrombin, factor Xa, and plasmin. Further modification of the P3 position by tert-leucine or penicillamine provided inhibitors with enhanced potencies (Becker et al. 2011; Hardes et al. 2015). A considerably improved affinity was achieved by incorporation of basic P5 residues (Becker et al. 2012). The most potent analogue 36 (MI-1148, Fig. 11.17) contains a para-guanidinomethyl substitution at the P5 phenyl ring and inhibits furin with a K\ni value of 5.5 pM (Hardes et al. 2015). These inhibitors have a similar selectivity profile, as described for analogue 34, and also inhibit PC4 in the low picomolar range. To the best of our knowledge, these compounds are the most potent synthetic inhibitors of furin-like PCs. Some of these compounds enabled the determination of crystal structures in complex with human furin (Fig. 11.17) (Dahms et al. 2014, 2016a; Hardes et al. 2015). A nearly identical binding mode was found for an analogous inhibitor containing the P5 guanidinomethyl substitution in meta-position (Dahms et al. 2014). The antiviral efficacy of inhibitor 36 and/or of its P3 Val analogue MI-701 (Becker et al. 2012; Hardes et al. 2015) was extensively studied in cell culture infected with numerous furin-dependent viruses. A significant antiviral effect was found with HPAIV H5N1 and H7N1 strains (Hardes et al. 2015; Lu et al. 2015) and with canine distemper virus (CDV), which belongs to the Paramyxoviridae and is closely related to measles virus (Hardes et al. 2015). Moreover, both inhibitors reduced the replication of Semliki Forest and chikungunya virus, both belonging to the alphaviruses, where furin cleaves the precursor protein p62 in the TGN (Hardes et al. 2017). An antiviral effect was also found against flaviviruses like West Nile and dengue-2 virus (Kouretova et al. 2017) and, for MI-701, also against Borna disease virus (Lennartz et al. 2016). Furthermore, both compounds strongly protected cells against anthrax, Shiga, and diphtheria toxin (Becker et al. 2012; Hardes et al. 2015).\n\n",

Among a series of weakly basic guanylhydrazones, several compounds like derivative 46 were prepared, which inhibit furin with inhibition constants close to 0.5 \u03bcM (Sielaff et al. 2011b). Even, the mono-guanylhydrazone derivative (47) still showed a significant furin inhibition with a K\ni value of 11.8 \u03bcM (Komiyama et al. 2009). Compound 47 also inhibits PC5 and PACE4 in the same range, whereas a reduced potency was observed against PC7. Despite the poor in vitro potency of the cell-permeable naphthofluorescein derivative B3 (48) with a K\ni value of 12 \u03bcM against furin, it was able to inhibit the furin-catalyzed activation of the remodeling protease proMT1-MMP, leading to decreased MMP-2 activation and cell motility of CHO cells.

Based on screening results, improved derivatives were prepared. The most potent compound from this study (55, Fig. 11.21) inhibits SKI-1/S1P with an IC\n50 value of 8 nM. However, the less potent analogue PF-429242 (56) was used for further evaluation because of its lower molecular weight and lipophilicity. PF-429242 is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of SKI-1/S1P with an IC\n50 value of 170 nM. Furthermore, it is highly selective for SKI-1/S1P; other serine proteases like trypsin, plasmin, kallikrein, or furin are not inhibited by this compound. However, PF-429242 suffers from rapid clearance and poor oral bioavailability in rats. Inhibition of SKI-1/S1P by PF-429242 blocks the cleavage of the glycoprotein of the old-world arenaviruses LASV and LCMV, resulting in reduced virus replication in infected cell cultures (Urata et al. 2011). Interestingly, no escape variants could be detected during or after the treatment with this SKI-1/S1P inhibitor. These studies were extended to several new-world arenaviruses like Junin or Guanarito virus, where PF-429242 also efficiently blocked glycoprotein processing and virus production (Pasquato et al. 2012).\n",

            "text": "Numerous viral surface proteins are cleaved by endosomal cysteine proteases. The papain-like cathepsin L activates the Ebola virus (EboV) glycoprotein (GP) (Chandran et al. 2005) or Nipah virus F protein (Diederich et al. 2008), and despite contradictory reports, cathepsins might be also involved in the GP activation of some coronaviruses (Zhou et al. 2015). In contrast to the majority of serine protease inhibitors, most cysteine protease inhibitors achieve potency by a covalent modification of their target enzymes, which can be reversible or irreversible (Siklos et al. 2015). Only a few basic examples of typical cysteine protease inhibitors will be provided in this paragraph. Classical warheads leading to a relatively specific irreversible inhibition of cysteine proteases are the epoxysuccinates, vinylsulfones, and allylsulfones, whereas chloromethyl and diazomethyl ketones react with both the cysteine and serine proteases. The archetypal epoxysuccinate E-64 (59) (Fig. 11.22) was isolated from Aspergillus japonicus and forms a thioether bond with the active-site cysteine (Hanada et al. 1978). It is a nonselective inhibitor of nearly all cysteine cathepsins, with the exception of cathepsin C (Turk et al. 2012). Many analogues of E-64 have been prepared by replacement of its leucyl-agmatine segment. The more hydrophobic ethyl ester prodrug E-64d (60) reached clinical phase III trials (Satoyoshi 1992). Peptidic vinylsulfones represent an additional class of widely used cysteine protease inhibitors, including numerous cathepsins. The active-site cysteine attacks the Michael acceptor like vinylsulfone and becomes irreversibly alkylated. For instance, cathepsins L and B are very rapidly inactivated by inhibitor 61 with second-order rate constants (k\ninact/K\ni) of 9.2 \u00d7 106 M\u22121s\u22121 and 4.2 \u00d7 105 M\u22121s\u22121, respectively (Palmer et al. 1995). A considerable inhibition of EboV GP and SARS-CoV S-protein cleavage was observed for close analogues in cell culture, like compound 62. However, this compound was completely inactive in a lethal SARS-CoV mouse model (Zhou et al. 2015). A considerably slower inactivation of cathepsin B (k\nobs/[I] = 9.2 \u00d7 106 M\u22121s\u22121) and other cysteine proteases was found by the allylsulfone 63 and numerous analogues, indicating a reduced electrophilicity of the allylsulfone segment (Fennell et al. 2013). Peptidic chloromethyl or diazomethyl ketones (Powers et al. 2002) are also very effective in vitro cysteine protease inhibitors. However, they suffer from instability in vivo and often from low selectivity.\n",

The ketone moiety of these analogues is attacked by the active-site cysteine leading to a covalent but reversible thiohemiketal complex. Additional examples are summarized in a recently published review (Siklos et al. 2015). Probably the most promising warhead for the development of covalent reversible cysteine protease inhibitors is the nitrile group. Nitriles react with the active-site cysteine forming a thioimidate adduct. A myriad of peptidic nitrile inhibitors have been prepared (Frizler et al. 2010), for instance, compound 67 inhibits cathepsins L and B with IC\n50 values of 20 nM and 1.8 nM (Greenspan et al. 2001). A potency considerably enhanced by four to five orders of magnitude could be achieved by the replacement of the C\u03b1 carbon in P1 position with nitrogen. For instance, the resulting azanitrile 68 binds to cathepsin L with a K\ni value of 74 pM and possesses a similar picomolar potency against cathepsins S and L (L\u00f6ser et al. 2008). The cathepsin K inhibitor odanacatib 69 reached clinical phase III development, but its development was recently cancelled due to side effects. Moreover, completely nonpeptidic nitrile derivatives have been developed, such as compound 70 that inhibits cathepsin L with a K\ni value of 2 nM (Fig. 11.23).\n",

Moreover, a considerable amount of the EboV GP is shed by the metalloprotease TACE (ADAM17) (Dolnik et al. 2004). The soluble GP activates dendritic cells and macrophages and causes the release of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and affects vascular permeability. The dysregulated inflammatory host response seems to contribute to the high virus pathogenicity (Escudero-Perez et al. 2014). These results suggest that inhibitors of metalloproteases may have antiviral activity.

A huge arsenal of excellent inhibitors against host proteases has been developed in the past for treatment of chronic diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes, risk of thrombosis, inflammatory ailments, and cancer, but only few of them reached the clinic. Despite loss of patent protection, many of these failed inhibitors or their analogues could still be suitable for short-term treatment of acute life-threatening infectious diseases, without being hampered by side effects that might develop after long-term application. One of the most important prerequisites for successful drug development is the identification of a valid target. For some virus infections, the relevant host proteases have been identified, in other cases there are still uncertainties, and further basic research on target identification is needed. Since proteases usually belong to families of similar enzymes which substitute each other, a broad-spectrum inhibitor could be tolerable or even advantageous for the special treatment of infectious disease, although selective drugs are usually preferred for most applications to minimize side effects. Ideally, host protease inhibitors should be used in combination with additional drugs. This strategy should improve the antiviral efficacy and allow the use of reduced concentrations, thereby minimizing side effects. The development of effective and tolerable host protease inhibitors will hopefully expand the arsenal of antiviral drugs in the future.",
