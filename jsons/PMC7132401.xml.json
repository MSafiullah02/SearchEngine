The isirv Antiviral Group (isirv-AVG) was established following the merger in April 2011 of the former Neuraminidase Inhibitor Susceptibility Network (NISN) with isirv. The Group aims to promote understanding of the means of prevention, treatment and control of influenza and other respiratory virus diseases, including the emergence of antiviral resistance. To communicate preclinical and clinical developments of potential novel/new antivirals three meetings have been held annually in different regions of the world.",

With emerging resistance to the drugs currently licensed for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza (primarily the neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) oseltamivir phosphate (Tamiflu) and the M2 inhibitors amantadine and rimantadine) and the lack of effective interventions against other respiratory viruses, the 3-day programme focused on the discovery and development of inhibitors of several virus targets and key host cell factors involved in virus replication or in mediating the inflammatory response. Virus targets included the influenza haemagglutinin, neuraminidase and M2 proteins, and both the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza polymerases and nucleoproteins. Therapies for rhinoviruses and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoV) were also discussed. With the emerging development of monoclonal antibodies as therapeutics, the potential implications of antibody-dependent enhancement of disease were also addressed. Topics covered all aspects from structural and molecular biology to preclinical and clinical studies. The importance of suitable clinical trial endpoints and regulatory issues were also discussed from the perspectives of both industry and government. This meeting summary provides an overview, not only for the conference participants, but also for those interested in the current status of antivirals for respiratory viruses.",

These target the virus M2 ion channel protein, involved in virus uncoating in the endosome (see 9.3 below). However, due to central nervous system complications in the elderly and lack of efficacy against influenza B, they were not widely employed. Additionally, since 2000 many viruses have acquired mutations in the M2 gene conferring resistance, including the current human A(H3N2) and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, and avian influenza A(H5N1) and A(H7N9) viruses which have caused sporadic human infections. Resistance initially emerged in China, possibly related to the ready availability of the aminoadamantanes in over the counter medications, and use in poultry feed.",

More recently, peramivir (Rapivab), administered intravenously, as well as a long-acting derivative of zanamivir, laninamivir (Inavir), have been approved in some countries. The US CDC recommends the use of NAIs for patients with suspected or confirmed influenza who are hospitalised or at high risk for complications due to influenza, including patients less than 2 and more than 65 years of age, those with underlying medical conditions or compromised immunity, and pregnant women (CDC, 2015b). Clinicians are advised to use clinical judgement to guide NAI treatment of outpatients who are not at high risk. One study showed that antivirals are under-prescribed for high-risk outpatients, with only 19% receiving a prescription when presenting at less than 48 h post symptom onset (Havers et al., 2014). Furthermore, only 7.5% of all laboratory-confirmed influenza outpatients were given an antiviral prescription, versus 30% who were prescribed antibiotics. With the recent emergence of the novel influenza A(H5N2) circulating in poultry in the USA, CDC recommends antiviral treatment as soon as possible for hospitalised patients with novel influenza A viruses associated with severe infection.",

The Cochrane group carried out meta-analysis of clinical data from 20 oseltamivir and 26 zanamivir trials (all enrolled outpatients with uncomplicated influenza), concluding that oseltamivir provided a 17 h benefit for adults and a 29 h benefit for children, and zanamivir, a 0.6 day benefit among all enrolled participants, regardless of influenza infection (intention to treat (ITT) population) (Jefferson et al., 2014). They failed to find a significant decrease in the number of hospitalizations after treatment, and concluded that, with the increased risk of nausea from oseltamivir (4%) and possible psychosis, the harm from treatment outweighed the benefits. However, the PRIDE study (Muthuri et al., 2014), using meta-analysis of global hospitalizations of more than 29,000 individual patients in 78 observational studies from 2009 to 2010, showed that NAI treatment led to a 19% decrease in mortality in adults, and, with early treatment, to a 50% reduction in mortality.

            "text": "Influenza RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is a good drug target since its active site is highly conserved. The polymerase complex, composed of three proteins, PA, PB1 and PB2, is essential for transcription, to generate capped viral mRNAs, replication, to generate the full length vRNA genome for incorporation into new virions, and antigenome cRNA, providing the template for full length vRNA. PB2 binds host cell pre-mRNA associated with the cell Pol II, then short 5\u2032 capped RNA fragments are cleaved off by the PA endonuclease, in a process known as cap snatching. Transcription elongation is then initiated by PB1 using the capped primer. Early attempts at crystallization of soluble fragments had limited success. However more recently, expression of the complete trimeric polymerases, using self-cleavable polyproteins, of the novel bat influenza virus H17N10 and influenza B enabled solving the X-ray crystal structures in complex with the RNA promoter, comprising 16\u201318 nucleotides from the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends of vRNA, to between 2.7 and 3.4 \u00c5 resolution (Pflug et al., 2014, Reich et al., 2014). The structures suggest that the cap-binding domain of PB2 rotates by 70\u00b0, first allowing the endonuclease to cleave the host pre-mRNA, to an alternative configuration in which the capped oligomer can enter the polymerase active site and prime transcription. All three subunits are thus involved in RNA binding and transcription. When the influenza B polymerase was complexed with 5\u2032 vRNA only, it yielded a different structure to that of the complex with both the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032vRNAs, which may represent an alternative conformation active in cap snatching.",

The primary endpoint was the area under the curve for virus shedding, determined by virus infectivity in cell culture and qRT-PCR. A statistically significant decrease in virus shedding was seen in the 1200/600 cohort, although the duration of virus shedding was not affected. There was also a dose-dependent decrease in symptom scores and duration of symptoms. Resistance screening revealed a mutation M431I in the PB2 gene in four of 72 patients, which resulted in a 57-fold reduction in sensitivity. However, mutant viruses had reduced fitness, estimated to be 8% of wild type. Cusack commented that resistance was seen within 2 passages in vitro. Mutation of phenylalanine 323, involved in tight binding of the inhibitor to influenza A, to serine leads to resistance. Lack of this phenylalanine in influenza B PB2 accounts in part for naturally poor binding and lack of activity against influenza B. A phase 2b trial is evaluating the dose range and once versus twice daily dosing in healthy patients.",

The recent structures of the polymerase complex and cryo-electron microscopy studies of the RNP have provided the basis for in silico screening of the Sigma catalogue for inhibitors of NP-polymerase and NP-RNA interactions. Naproxen, a known anti-inflammatory inhibiting cellular cylcooxygenase 2 (COX-2), was identified as a competitor of NP\u2013RNA interaction, and protected the NP C-terminus against proteolysis. Naproxen reduced infection of both H3N2 and H1N1 viruses in cells with an EC50 of 50 \u03bcM, and at 2\u20138 mg/kg per day decreased virus titers in mice (Lejal et al., 2013). Two derivatives were synthesised to be more specific for viral RNP, naproxen A and CO (Tarus et al., 2015). Naproxen CO competes with RNA binding to NP and destabilizes NP-RNA oligomers while stabilizing monomeric NP. It was more potent with an IC50 of 2\u20133 \u03bcM, more soluble and less toxic than naproxen, but no longer inhibited COX-2 in human A549 cells.",

Yu and colleagues reported here that they have identified a novel thienodiazepine as an N inhibitor with improved potency and broad spectrum activity against both RSV A and B strains, although it was also cell type dependent.

An X-ray co\u2013crystal structure showed the binding site overlapped the N\u2013P interaction site.

            "text": "While the current NAIs are based on the transition state analogue DANA, a new series of compounds, based on the natural substrate sialic acid, 2,3, difluoro sialic acids (DFSA), have recently been described (Kim et al., 2013). DFSAs require the catalytic activity of the NA to bind, hence are termed mechanism-based inhibitors. They form a covalent link to a tyrosine in the enzyme active site. Unlike the NAIs, they are not competitive inhibitors and their efficacy depends on a slow turnover of the covalently linked inhibitor. Substitution on the sugar ring, with either 4-amino or 4-guanidino groups, affected affinity and rates of binding and dissociation in an IC50 kinetics assay (Barrett et al., 2011). Even more striking was the effect of the orientation of the 3 fluoro group, with the equatorial being more potent than the axial. DFSAs have broad efficacy, with IC50s in enzyme assays and in plaque reduction assays in the low nM to \u03bcM range, and can protect mice from a lethal influenza infection. They are also effective against viruses resistant to oseltamivir and zanamivir. Theoretically resistance to DFSAs should be more difficult to select, since mutations would compromise the NA function. No resistant viruses were selected after 12 passages of an A(H1N1)pdm09 and an influenza B virus in vitro, with virus reduced to almost undetectable levels. A further 3 passages in a lower drug concentration, however, led to isolation of a small plaque variant from the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, which was highly resistant in the plaque reduction assay. The mutant virus had barely detectable enzyme activity, but replicated to comparable titers in vitro as the wild type virus. Preliminary results suggest a novel mutation/s in the NA, which remains to be confirmed. These DFSAs are also active against human PIV3 (Dirr et al., 2015, Streltsov et al., 2015). Since the NAs of human H3N2 (Mohr et al., 2015) and H1N1 (Hooper et al., 2015) viruses can demonstrate receptor binding as well as the catalytic function, with a recent focus on antivirals targeting the HA we need to understand this secondary role of the NA, which may compensate for inhibition of the HA receptor binding function. We may need to target both the HA and NA.",

Pinto and colleagues have created a carbocyclic analogue of zanamivir, by replacing the hydrophilic glycerol side chain with the hydrophobic pentyloxy group of oseltamivir (Kerry et al., 2013, Mohan et al., 2014). This inhibitor targets only the catalytic site, and showed nM potency in the NAI assay (Ki = 0.46 nM; Ki (zanamivir) = 0.16 nM) and an EC50 of 80 nM in cell culture; activity was only 10-fold lower against the H275Y oseltamivir resistant mutant (100\u20131000 fold resistant).

            "text": "Once the influenza virus binds to sialic acid receptors, it is taken up into the endosome, where the low pH activates the formation of the M2 ion channel, causing an influx of protons, into the virion interior. This results in dissociation of the M1 matrix protein from the virus RNP, which is then released into the cell. The M2 protein is highly conserved, and can be inhibited by the adamantanes. However resistance arises rapidly, due to three major mutations, L26F, V27A or S31N, S31N being the most common. The S31N mutant has a more contracted channel compared with that of the wild type (WT). It is hypothesised that the pore undergoes a conformational change from open-closed to closed-open as the H+ goes from outside to inside. Guided by molecular dynamics simulations, NMR and X-ray crystallography studies, the group developed amantadine derivatives which are effective against the resistant mutants (Wang et al., 2015, Wang et al., 2013). One compound which contains a charged ammonium group, M2WJ332, sits inside the channel, and in the plaque reduction assay has an EC50 of 153 nM against the S31N mutant in comparison to 328 nM for amantadine against the WT M2. Four passages in drug concentrations increasing from 300 to 600 nM did not select a resistant mutant. However, greater increase in drug concentrations (330, 376 nM, 1.6 and 35.9 \u03bcM) selected resistant mutants with an L26I mutation, and by passage 6 a reversion of the N31S occurred, which decreased binding. However, the limitation remains that new compounds need to bind both the wild type and mutant M2s, and the L26I mutation is found naturally in avian viruses isolated from wild birds. Additionally, the BM2 of influenza B viruses is not inhibited by aminoadamantanes.",

The top five were screened against wild type viruses, with three showing influenza A specific inhibition, but not broadly reactive. The other two were broadly reactive, M4 reacting against a subset of viruses and M53 showing reactivity against both RNA and DNA viruses, suggesting a host cell target. The three influenza-specific hits were S57, which had broader reactivity, interacting with the C-terminus of the NP, S119, reacting with the N-terminus of the NP protein, and S20, reacting with the HA of group 1 viruses, but not H3N2 or influenza B viruses. When tested against wild type virus, S20 had an IC50 of 80 nM and caused a maximum reduction in virus titers of >3 log10 with low toxicity (CC50 40 \u03bcM). Time of addition assays and use of an HA/NA pseudotype HIV particle showed that S20 inhibited entry. Resistant viruses were selected after 4 passages in vitro, all with mutations affecting the HA, primarily around the \u201cB\u201d loop structure connecting the large and small helices of the HA2 subunit (White et al., 2015). In a red cell fusion assay, the pH of fusion (50% fusion at pH 5) was lowered below pH 5 in the presence of S20, indicating stabilisation of the prefusion form by S20. S20 also protected the HA from conversion to the trypsin sensitive form under low pH conditions. In contrast, the pH of fusion of a M59I mutant was unaffected by S20. In silico docking studies predicted that S20 binds both the HA1 and HA2 in the stalk region, corresponding to the area where resistance mutations occurred.",

IC50s ranged from the low nM to \u223c100 nM (Nicol et al., 2012). In PR8 recombinants with different HAs, sensitivity was dependent on the HA. The Entry Blocker did not show the same strain specificity. They acted upstream of the nuclear import of the RNPs. The peptides caused aggregation of fluorescently labelled virus particles on the surface of host cells, and appeared to slow internalisation.

The common cold, generally a self-limiting disease, was an original target, but no broadly effective inhibitor has been demonstrated; additionally, it would need to be cheap with no side effects. Interferon, protease inhibitors, and capsid binding inhibitors all showed efficacy in laboratory models, but not in patients (Hayden, 2013). Although rhinovirus (RV) is an important cause of exacerbations of COPD and asthma, hence being alternative targets, there is no good clinical model for evaluation of therapies. Prophylaxis may be more feasible. In a family study there was a significant decrease in asthma scores with pleconaril prophylaxis. However, approaches to therapy have been further complicated by the discovery of a new species of rhinovirus, RV-C, in 2006, in addition to the known RV-A and RV-B viruses (Palmenberg and Gern, 2015). As with RV-B they are inherently resistant to capsid binders and have a different cellular receptor to both RV-A and RV-B (CDHR3 instead of ICAM-1). Host-directed therapies, such as TLR antagonists and probiotics, may be promising, and recent studies have reported some beneficial effect of probiotics (Lactobacillus spp.) on the occurrence of common cold illnesses in children (Ballengee and Turner, 2014).",

In the summer and fall of 2014 there was a large increase in severe respiratory illness in the USA and the CDC and state health laboratories identified 1,529 people PCR positive for EV-D68 (Midgley et al., 2015); however rhinovirus, Coxsackie virus and echoviruses will also be detected by the rhinovirus/enterovirus multiplex PCR. Using VP1 sequencing to identify EV-D68, 46% of specimens were positive for EV-D68. Several cases of flaccid myelitis have been temporally related to EV-D68 infection but a causal role of EV-D68 has not been established. A new real-time RT-PCR test is available from the CDC (Zhuge et al., 2015). Three strains have been identified with 92% belonging to one strain, 7.4% to the second, and a single case of the third strain. The virus grows in MK cells and human lung A549 cells and binds to \u03b12,6 linked sialic acids. It is sensitive to pleconaril and other capsid binding inhibitors in vitro, and a randomised double blind placebo controlled trial suggested a shorter time to culture and PCR negative status with oral pleconaril. DAS181 which removes sialic acid receptors is also being evaluated (Abzug et al., 2015).",

            "text": "The four types of Dengue virus (DENV) cause up to 100 million cases, with 2.1 million severe cases and up to 21,000 deaths per year. Infections range from asymptomatic to a self-limited febrile illness, dengue fever (DF), to life threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). The roles of antibodies and T cells in mediating protection versus pathogenesis remains unclear. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) was identified more than 40 years ago, and is hypothesised to be due to the presence of subneutralizing levels of antibody and the consequent binding of antibody-coated virus to the Fc receptors (FcR) which facilitates virus entry, leading to enhanced infection. In the case of secondary infections and of maternal antibody in newborns, there may be some cross-reactive antibodies, but insufficient to neutralize virus. A model of DHF/DSS-like disease has been developed in AG129 mice lacking the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR) and the IFN-\u03b3R (IFNAR\u2212/\u2212; IFN-\u03b3R\u2212/\u2212). This mouse model reproduces key pathophysiological features of DHF/DSS, including similar cellular and tissue tropism, lethal vascular leakage, cytokine storm, low platelet count, elevated hematocrit, and hemorrhage (Tang et al., 2015). In order to test the hypothesis, mice were pretreated with different levels of antibody IP, followed by DENV challenge: 0.5 \u03bcg of antibody was too low to have any effect; subneutralizing doses of 2\u201315 \u03bcg led to severe disease and death; while a fully neutralizing dose of 500 \u03bcg protected all mice. Virus load was significantly higher at 48 h in the liver of ADE mice compared with non-ADE mice. The importance of the interaction between the Fc in the DENV-Ab complex and Fc\u03b3 receptor was confirmed using an antibody with a mutant Fc region that cannot bind Fc\u03b3 receptors, or Fc\u03b3 receptor-blocking antibody or the Fab fragment of anti-DENV Ab. These interventions could decrease the enhanced virus titer in the livers of ADE mice to non-ADE levels. In another model using a VEE replicon and the DENV E2 protein (virus replicon particles), AG129 immunised mice had a higher survival rate and lower virus titers when challenged with DENV (Zellweger et al., 2013). However, passive transfer of 50\u20131500 \u03bcl of immune sera resulted in ADE in recipient mice.",

The mechanism of vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) is not well understood. Using a swine model, Khurana et al. (2013) showed that vaccination of pigs with an H1N2 virus and challenge with a A(H1N1)pdm09 virus resulted in the pigs having enhanced pneumonia and disease. Using recombinant expression of HA1 and HA2 and SPR binding assays, they showed that the H1N2 sera reacted with the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, but that antibodies bound only to the HA2 of the H1N1 virus, and competed with other stem-targeting antibodies. The H1N2 sera also enhanced A(H1N1)pdm09 infection of MDCK cells and promoted virus fusion activity. Only adsorption of the sera with HA2 had any effect in reducing the enhancement effect. Live vaccination of pigs caused no ADE; however administration of the same, but UV-inactivated, vaccine resulted in ADE.

There are 5 types of S1P receptor, S1PR1-5. S1PR1-3 are found on various types of cells and tissues, while S1PR 4 is found mostly in cells of the immune system, and S1PR5 mostly in the nervous system. The sphingosine analogue, AAL-R, targets types 1, 3, 4, and 5 S1PRs, blunting the Type 1 IFN response and cytokine induction upon influenza infection of mice, without affecting the antibody response (Marsolais et al., 2009, Walsh et al., 2011). In the presence of AAL-R, purified dendritic cells (DC) from spleen and lung produced lower levels of IFN-\u03b1 after virus infection or stimulation with the IFN inducer CpG. There was also a marked reduction in infiltration of PML and macrophages into the lung and resultant pulmonary tissue injury. DC maturation was suppressed, limiting proliferation of specific antiviral T cells in the lung and draining lymph nodes. The S1P1-specific receptor agonist, CYM5442, caused similar effects to the broadly-active AAL-R (Walsh et al., 2011); however, S1P1 knockout is lethal in mice.",

After HA-mediated membrane fusion the cores detach from the endosome surface and M1 and the vRNPs dissociate from each other in the cytosol, allowing the vRNPs to be transported through nuclear pores into the nucleus. Treatment of cells with Importazole, an importin inhibitor, or mutation of a consensus sequence in M1 through which transportin binds, inhibits post-fusion transport of the vRNPs. Using siRNA silencing of cellular targets 177 hits were obtained, with 29 affecting uncoating, and 24 nuclear import. Knockdown of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), an essential component in ubiquitin-dependent aggresome formation and assembly, reduced uncoating (Banerjee et al., 2014). HDAC6 binds to free ubiquitin in the cytosol, via its C-terminal zinc-finger ubiquitin-binding domain (UBD), and is recruited to the late endosome surface after infection. The capsids mimic misfolded protein aggregates binding the unanchored ubiquitin. Free ubiquitin is also found in virus particles. HDAC6 associates with actin and myosin 10 on microtubules, leading to physical disruption of the endosome/core structure. Cleavage of the UBD by Caspase 3, prevents virus uncoating. Thus these cellular proteins offer potential targets for antiviral strategies.",

Administered via inhalation or a nebuliser, the sialidase cleaves terminal sialic acid residues from glycans on the surface of respiratory cells, thus reducing the receptors available for binding of viruses, such as influenza and parainfluenza. In H5N1-infected mice DAS181 administered at 1 mg/kg/day from 24 h pre-to 72 h post-infection reduced lethality (Belser et al., 2007). For mice infected with either oseltamivir-sensitive or -resistant H7N9 viruses, 0.3, 0.6 and 1 mg/kg all protected against death (Marjuki et al., 2014). In a phase IIb trial, patients with influenza received 10 mg daily for 3 days (multidose), or 10 mg as a single dose, or placebo (Moss et al., 2012). While both groups treated with DAS181 showed a significant decrease in virus load at 24 h, only the multidose group showed a significant decrease at 3 and 5 days. There was, however, no difference in the time to alleviation of clinical symptoms. More than 80 patients, primarily immunocompromised transplant patients, have been treated with DAS181 on a compassionate use basis. There was a decrease in virus load and less need for oxygenation in four PIV-infected children (Waghmare et al., 2015). A cystic fibrosis patient infected with an oseltamivir-resistant influenza virus showed improvement (Silveira et al., 2015), and hematopoietic cell transplant (HTC) recipients infected with PIV have also appeared to benefit (Chalkias et al., 2014). Unpublished results have shown that up to 14 of 16 patients had decreased virus load and increased survival. A phase II trial for PIV pneumonia in immunocompromised patients is currently underway. While DAS181 generally appears safe, some patients have shown elevated alkaline phosphatase levels, with transient increases in liver enzymes (Moss et al., 2012). It has systemic immunogenicity, with anti-DAS181 antibodies induced in healthy patients (Zenilman et al., 2015). Hence, it is unlikely to be useful systemically, and it is also undergoing particle size testing to minimise systemic absorption.",

Small molecule activators of sirtuins block in vitro replication of viruses, including influenza, HCMV, adenovirus, and polyomavirus. Antivirals are being developed based on Sirt1 and 2 dual inhibition, and Sirt 6 activation. The most potent inhibitor has an IC50 of 0.4 nM. The simultaneous inhibition of Sirt1 and 2 unexpectedly resulted in a 5-fold decrease in influenza virus titer. It appears that the initial NS1 down regulation of p53 (Terrier et al., 2013) is restored with Sirt1/2 inhibition. This results in reactivation of p53, thus inducing apoptosis, specifically in virus-infected cells. Compared to oseltamivir, novel Sirt1/2 inhibitors lead to enhanced virus clearance.

Administration of a TLR4-specific IgG also protected wild-type mice infected with a lethal dose of influenza PR8. Intravenous administration of 200 \u03bcg/day of Eritoran (E5564), a synthetic TLR4 antagonist, at 2, 4 or 6 days post-infection, increased survival of PR8-infected mice (Shirey et al., 2013). The mice showed reduced lung pathology, clinical symptoms and cytokine gene expression. Treatment with tenfold less Eritoran decreased survival from 90% to 40% and Eritoran efficacy decreased with increasing virus challenge, from 90% survival with 7500 TCID50 to 60% and 25% survival with 10,000 and 20,000 TCID50, respectively. Mice subsequently challenged with PR8 all survived, indicating an immune response had developed despite the Eritoran treatment. Cotton rats infected with non-adapted H3N2 (A/Wuhan/359/95) and A(H1N1)pdm09 (A/California/07/1009) influenza viruses and treated with Eritoran showed reduced lung pathology and lower levels of IL-6 and IL-10 (Shirey et al., 2013). In both the mice (lung homogenates) and the cotton rats (blood), Eritoran treatment of influenza infection showed strong reduction in concentrations of high mobility group protein 1 (HMGB1), a TLR4 agonist known to be involved in systemic inflammation.",

For the M2 inhibitors, a limited number of mutations are known to correlate with resistance in cell culture and in vivo. However for the NAIs, cell culture sensitivity does not always correlate with reduced inhibition of the NA enzyme. Hence enzyme-based assays have been used as a surrogate assay for monitoring influenza virus susceptibility to NAIs. The WHO Expert Working Group for Surveillance on Influenza Antiviral Susceptibility has used the fold increase in IC50 compared with the reference IC50 value as an indicator of possible resistance. \u2018Reduced inhibition\u2019 defines influenza A viruses with a 10- to 100-fold increase in IC50, or influenza B viruses with a 5- to 50-fold increase in IC50, and \u2018highly reduced inhibition\u2019 defines influenza A viruses with >100-fold increase in IC50 or influenza B viruses with >50-fold increase in IC50 (WHO, 2012). While commercial kits do not include reference viruses, panels of resistant viruses are available from both the CDC and isirv AVG. A major limitation of the enzyme-based assay is that viruses must be amplified in culture for testing, which may result in selection for or against resistant viruses, as well as de novo mutations. A new bioluminescent assay may, however, allow direct assessment of NA enzyme inhibition in clinical samples. Various sequencing methods have been used to identify NA substitutions, including high throughput 96 well pyrosequencing or next generation sequencing. However, while sensitive, most of these methods only allow screening for known resistance mutations. Novel mutations require the use of phenotypic assays. Correlating the presence of low levels of resistant virus to wild type virus in a clinical sample with lack of clinical effectiveness is also challenging.",

Prior to the main influenza season, 28% of isolates in Sapporo/Hokkaido had the H275Y mutation (Takashita et al., 2015). Phylogenetic analysis suggested the clonal expansion of a single mutant virus. The virus replicated as well as the wild type virus in cell culture and in ferrets, and was transmitted as efficiently by droplet infection. H275Y-containing viruses had two additional substitutions in NA, V241I and N369K, known to increase replication and transmission fitness.

Years 1\u20135 of the study included non-immunocompromised patients >1 year old; year 6 included only children aged <12 years.

Similarly, antiviral treatment is recommended for hospitalised patients and outpatients at high risk for influenza complications, with suspected or confirmed influenza; providers are urged not to wait for laboratory confirmation and not to rely on results of insensitive assays before beginning treatment. However, several studies suggest that insensitive rapid influenza diagnostic assays (RIDT) are commonly used in outpatient and inpatient settings and that providers wait for the RIDT result to begin treatment. Many new sensitive molecular diagnostic assays are now commercially available. However, while very sensitive, these assays are expensive and several studies suggest empiric treatment during periods of high influenza prevalence may be more cost-effective.

Efficacy trials for serious influenza in hospitalised patients face several challenges, including a heterogeneous population on other medications, a current standard of care that varies by local practices, no current product with proven efficacy that would allow an inferiority trial, and no validated clinical endpoint or accepted biomarker. Efficacy endpoints have not been standardised for all types of influenza trials; most trials warrant examination of multiple secondary endpoints. Virologic endpoints, e.g. virus shedding, are important secondary endpoints but not primary endpoints. FDA encourages the development of novel efficacy endpoints for trials of the treatment of serious influenza and conducting pilot studies of them before entering into phase 3 trials.

Thus, only 121 influenza infected participants qualified for primary efficacy analysis (43 placebo, 78 peramivir); only 28% had positive virus titers at baseline and 45% had had symptoms for >48 h. Also, inclusion of oseltamivir in standard care was often used for patients who were clinically more seriously ill. Thus, the patients included in the final analysis were less ill, and may not be representative of severe influenza, and were admitted after the optimal time for a NAI to be effective. The study was terminated early as it was deemed unlikely to enrol adequate numbers. The experience with this trial highlighted several roadblocks to conducting clinical trials for new antiviral drugs in hospitalised patients. Widespread availability and use of oseltamivir obfuscates the ability to randomly allocate to a placebo group and reasons for hospitalization vary, so that hospitalization per se may not be an appropriate case definition for severe disease; hospitalised patients represent a continuum of disease. There is a lack of validated endpoints and many variables could contribute to the resolution of the endpoints used in the peramivir study. Conducting clinical trials in hospitalised patients with influenza thus presents unique research difficulties.

Several novel agents with the potential to add to the current armamentarium against influenza were described. Additional studies on other respiratory viruses were presented, including those targeting the proteins involved in replication, receptor binding and fusion, and host cell targets. While each is in a different phase of development, few have made it to human studies. Future challenges include identifying the best methods to evaluate efficacy against severe influenza and other respiratory diseases and to monitor for adverse effects related to antibodies.",
