Several drugs therapeutic interventions for coronavirus were investigated during the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), caused by a novel coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Reviews of the available literature suggest that interferon alpha and beta might be of benefit in patients with severe MERS-CoV infection[3,4].Interferon(IFN) is an immune active protein with broad-spectrum antiviral effect in vivo, IFN-\u03b1 is a broad spectrum antiviral drug, different preparations of recombinant rIFNs (rIFN-\u03b12a, rIFN-\u03b12b, rIFN-\u03b21a, and rIFN-\u03b21b) were active against MERS-CoV in vitro[5]. Interferon-\u03b1 treatment strongly inhibite severe in vitro cytopathology induced by MERS-coronavirus replication. Furthermore, MERS-CoV was found to be 50-100 times more sensitive to alpha interferon (IFN-\u03b1) treatment than SARS-CoV in vitro. These findings highlight relevant differences between these distantly related CoVs in terms of their interaction with and evasion of the cellular innate immune response[6].Arbidol was used to treat for influenza infection[7]. Arbidol play an antiviral role not only directly inhibiting virus but also inducing interferon and immune cells producing[8], After taking arbidol, there was a significant increase of serum immunoglobulin levels of CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes in patients with hypoimmunity[9]. It was reported that Arbidol was effective of COVID-19 at a concentration range of 10-30 \u03bcM in vitro.",
