Since RNA viruses need their RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) for their replication, in theory, COVID-19 pandemic could be treated effectively by a series of RdRP inhibitors such as Remdesivir which is an ATP antagonist and originally developed in 2019 by Gilead Sciences in California for the treatment of Flu and Ebola viruses [1]. However, ATP antagonists in general could potentially inhibit many other ATP-dependent enzymes such as ATPases, protein kinases, and Chaperons, and therefore could cause a number of side effects, depending on their doses, as \u201cconventional\u201d anti-cancer chemos (DNA/RNA poisons). Thus, ideally, far more selective chemical drugs, which target a specific \u201chost\u201d enzyme essential for viral infection, but not for normal physiology of hosts, would be desirable for the COVID-19 treatment as well. Among such target enzymes is the major \u201cpathogenic\u201d kinase PAK1 in hosts that is essential for malaria and viral infection in general [3].",

Among them PAK1 is the major \u201cpathogenic\u201d kinase whose abnormal activation is responsible for a wide variety of diseases such as cancers, inflammation, viral infection, malaria, immuno-suppression, ageing, and so on [3]. Among PAK1-blockers, caffeic acid (CA) and its ester (caffeic acid phenethyl ester = CAPE) in a bee-product called \u201cpropolis\u201d were the first natural ingredients that were shown to inhibit RAC, which activates directly PAK1 [4]. Interestingly in 2005, an old anti-malaria drug \u201cChloroquine\u201d (CQ) was also shown to suppress SARS/ coronavirus infection in cell culture with IC50 around 1 \u03bcM [5], although the precise molecular mechanism underlying its anti-viral activity remains unknown till recently. The anti-coronaviral effect of CQ and Remdesivir (IC50 around 1 \u03bcM of each) was recently confirmed in vitro by a team at Chinese Academy of Sciences as well: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-0282-0/\n",

Further-more, expression of LLC2 depends on the coronavirus receptor (called ACE2 = Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) -induced CK2/RAS-PAK1-RAF-AP1 signaling pathway [[8], Fig. 1\n].

Originally honey-bees extract something from young buds of trees such as poplar and willow and blend the extract with their saliva to make the hexagonal beehive to protect their larva from various pathogens. Thus, propolis is a \u201cherbal\u201d medicine prepared by bees. It is both anti-bacterial and anti-viral. It is well known to be used as a mixture of antibiotics for preparing mummies of deceased royal families to be stored under pyramids.",

The major anti-cancer ingredient in Brazilian green propolis is artepillin C (ARC), whereas those in subtropical propolis from Okinawa or Taiwan are polyphenols called Nymphaeols which directly inhibit PAK1 [11].

Its recommended daily dose is 1 ml (250 mg) /10 kg (body weight). Unfortunately, however, its stock is rather limited for COVID-19 patients, because it has been saved mainly for therapy of deadly pancreatic cancers and the life-long treatment of a rare genetic brain tumor called NF (neurofibromatosis types 1 and 2). Furthermore, the cell-permeability of both caffeic acid (CA) and ARC is rather poor, mainly due to their COOH moiety. Thus, a few years ago, via Click Chemistry (CC), we managed to boost their cell-permeability by making their 1,2,3-triazolyl esters (called 15A and 15C), which are 100 and over 400 times more potent than ARC and CA, respectively [12].",

Interestingly, more than a decade ago, triptolide was found to suppress virus production during dengue virus infection of human lungs by blocking PAK1 signaling pathway [17]. However, its water-solubility is rather poor. Thus, several years ago, a team at University of Minnesota led by Gunda George, a German organic chemist, phosphorylated OH group at position 14 of Triptolide to boost its water-solubility over 3000 times [18]. The resultant phosphatase-sensitive prodrug of triptolide called \u201cMinnelide\u201d is currently in clinical trials for cancers. Thus, both Triptolide and Minnelide would be potentially useful for treating coronaviral infection as well.",

Thus, to reduce its side effect, a Merck team led by William Campbell chemically reduced it to develop \u201cIvermectin\u201d (dihydro-Avermectin), sharing the Nobel prize in 2015. It was eventually marketed by Merck into medical use in 1981. It has been used to treat many types of parasite infestations including head lice, scabies, river blindness (onchocerciasis), etc. 3 decades after its discovery, it was shown by a Russian team to suppress the growth of cancers as well, and eventually we found that inactivation of PAK1 is the major molecular mechanism underlying its anti-cancer action [19]. Thus, it could potentially serve as an alternative (and inexpensive) therapeutic to eradicate the PAK1-dependent coronaviral infection as well.

Thus, shortly after one of us (HM) urged both the White House and NIH to use a series of PAK1 blockers including HQ for the treatment of coronaviral infection, FDA quickly approved to use HQ or CQ for clinical trials for COVID-19 patients in NY City, the hottest-bed of COVID-19 in US. According to a French team's clinical trial for 30\u201340 COVID-19 patients, the effective daily dose of HQ was found to be around 600 mg [[26], see Fig. 3\n]. Very interestingly, the combination of HQ and another old anti-malaria drug called Azithromycin (AZ) was far more effective than HQ alone clinically [26]. AZ is a macrolide discovered 1980 by Pliva and approved for medical use in 1988.

Thus, via Click Chemistry (CC), we have boosted its cell-permeability over 500 times (with IC50 around 5\u201324 nM against B15F10 melanoma and A549 lung cancer cells, respectively) [29]. The resultant potent PAK1-blocker, called 1,2,3-triazolyl ester of Ketorolac (15 K), suppresses both growth and metastasis of chemo-resistant human pancreatic cancer xenogrfats in mice with IC50 below 0.1 mg/kg/day, and causes no side effect even at 5 mg/kg/day [30].

In other words, when its vaccine becomes available sometime in 2021, 12\u201318 months after its outbreak, it is most likely that the vaccine would be no longer useful in a practical sense. Thus, non-vaccine \u201cfast-track\u201d therapeutics would be definitely needed for solving such a pandemic viral infection as soon as possible. Here we introduced the pre-existing natural or synthetic compounds known to inhibit PAK1 directly or its up-stream, thereby potentially blocking coronaviral infection or pathogenesis. Among these PAK1-blockers, at least CQ and Ivermectin have been proven to block the replication of COVID-19 in Vero cell culture with IC50 ranging 1\u20133 \u03bcM, and a combination of HQ and AZ or ciclesonide alone have been shown clinically to ease the pathogenic symptom of this virus. Thus, we would urgently encourage world-leading viral experts to test whether the rest of PAK1-blockers listed here also directly block the replicaion of this virus in cell culture, and if so, test their anti-COVID-19 efficacy clinically in an attempt to save over 2 million victims world-wide.",

Thus, PAK1-blockers could knock-out each virus with \u201cdouble\u201d punches (Fig. 2). Lastly it should be high-lighted that the major purpose of PAK1-blockers for clinical application such as therapy of viral infection is to reduce the virus-induced abnormally activated PAK1 to the \u201cnormal\u201d level (instead of \u201cnull\u201d level) in patients suffering from PAK1-dependent diseases. Thus, it is very unlikely that such a cautious measure/approach would cause any serious side effect.",
