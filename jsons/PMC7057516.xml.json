            "text": "Considerable evidence in preclinical models shows that the use of iloprost for the treatment of ARDS and pulmonary inflammation might be of significant benefit. In small animal models, investigators showed that iloprost improves endothelial barrier function and reduces the detrimental signs of pulmonary edema [13]. It also reduces the pulmonary sequestration of leukocytes and platelets, which is a central disease mechanism underlying the development of ARDS [14]. This evidence could be transferred into different models of lung injury, showing positive evidence for the reduction of pulmonary inflammation in a pressure-induced model of lung injury [15]. The anti-inflammatory effect was attributed to the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) system and the involvement of lipoxin A4 [16]. Ras-related protein 1 (RAP-1) might also be involved in the protective role of iloprost [17]. This positive anti-inflammatory effect of iloprost on the pulmonary tissue was also demonstrated in several models of ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. Furthermore, IR injury can also result in ARDS and pulmonary failure. Iloprost was able to reduce this pulmonary compromise in several preclinical studies [18\u201321]. The anti-inflammatory effect of iloprost was also shown in large animal models of lung injury using porcine models of ARDS [22\u201324]. Here, again, iloprost showed an anti-inflammatory effect. In addition, the shunt fraction could be reduced, which resulted in improved oxygenation and improved pulmonary dynamics, which is essential for the reinstitution of spontaneous ventilation during and following ARDS [22, 23, 25\u201327]. This shows that the preclinical data identified a beneficial effect of iloprost on ARDS. So far, only one study on inhaled iloprost in adult patients with ARDS has been conducted, although an application of inhaled iloprost is noted in the guidelines of the Association of the Scientific Medical Societies (AWMF) for the treatment of ARDS [28]. The AWMF guidelines indicate that the use of ARDS can be considered, especially in patients with severe ARDS who are mechanically ventilated and not self-consenting [7].",

Therefore, in the control group, NaCl 0.9% will be used to keep the airway circuit moist, which is the standard of care for the treatment of patients with pulmonary insufficiency [7]. Considering the pharmacokinetic and dynamic profile of iloprost, we have suggested an approach of an application of three times per day, with a dose of 20 \u03bcg, which seems to be an average dose in the trials reported up to now. The rationale behind this was that iloprost also exerts an anti-inflammatory effect that may last up to 6 h [29\u201333]. Therefore, an administration of iloprost three times a day would allow a significant time frame per day to be covered by anti-inflammation due to this drug. The duration of 5 days was included in the trial because the pathophysiology of ARDS develops within the first few days and is progressive during that period.",
