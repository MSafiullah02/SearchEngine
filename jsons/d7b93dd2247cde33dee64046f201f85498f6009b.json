Overall, subclinical infections are much more common than those that result in disease. Their relative frequency accounts for the difficulty of tracing chains of transmission, even with the help of laboratory diagnostics. Although clinical cases may be somewhat more productive sources of virus than subclinical infections, because the latter do not restrict the movement of the infected host, they can be most important as sources of viral dissemination. In most acute infections, whether clinically apparent or not, virus is shed in highest titers during the late stages of the incubation period, before the influence of the host-immune response takes effect. Persistent infections, whether or not they are associated with episodes of clinical disease, also play an important role in the perpetuation of many viruses in nature. For example, prolonged virus shedding can reintroduce virus into a population of susceptibles all of which have been born since the last clinically apparent episode of infection. This is important in the survival of rubella virus in some isolated populations. Sometimes the persistence of infection, the production of disease, and the transmission of virus are dissociated; for example, togavirus and arenavirus infections may have little adverse effect on their reservoir hosts (arthropods, birds, and rodents), but transmission may be very efficient.

A virus may disappear from a population because it exhausts its potential supply of susceptible hosts as they acquire immunity to reinfection with the same virus. Depending on duration of immunity and the pattern of virus shedding, the 'critical population size' varies considerably with different viruses and with different host species. The most precise data on the importance of population size in acute nonpersistent infections come from studies of measles. Persistence of measles virus in a population depends upon a continuous supply of susceptible children. Analyses of the incidence of measles in large cities and in island communities have shown that a population of about half a million persons is needed to ensure a large enough annual input of new susceptible hosts, by birth or immigration, to maintain measles virus in the population. Because infection depends on respiratory transmission, the duration of epidemics of measles is correlated inversely with population density. If a population is dispersed over a large area, the rate of spread is reduced and the epidemic may last longer, so that the number of susceptible persons needed to maintain transmission chains is reduced. On the other hand, in such a situation a break in the transmission chain is much more likely.

Arthropod transmission may be 'mechanical', where the arthropod acts as a 'flying pin', or more commonly, 'biological', involving replication of the virus in the arthropod vector. The arthropod vector acquires virus by feeding on the blood of a viremic person or animal. Replication of the ingested virus, initially in the arthropod's gut, and its spread to the salivary glands takes several days; the interval varies with different viruses and is influenced by ambient temperature. Virions in the salivary secretions of the vector are injected into human or animal hosts during subsequent blood meals. Most arboviruses have localized natural habitats in which specific receptive arthropod and vertebrate hosts are involved in the viral life cycle. Vertebrate reservoir hosts are usually wild mammals or birds; humans are rarely involved in primary transmission cycles, although the exceptions to this generalization are important (e.g., Venezuelan equine encephalitis, yellow fever, and dengue viruses).
