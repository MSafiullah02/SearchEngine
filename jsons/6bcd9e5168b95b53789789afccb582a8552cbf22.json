The pathophysiology of COVID-19 infection has not been elucidated but cytokine storm, prothrombotic state and myocardial dysfunction have been implicated. (1) Echocardiography is an essential bedside tool, which allows non-invasive assessment of biventricular function in COVID-19 patients, and echocardiographic findings can significantly influence decision making in the appropriate clinical settings. (2) We aimed at studying the association of in-hospital mortality with right ventricular size measured by a focused, time-efficient echocardiography protocol. (2) In this retrospective study, we enrolled consecutive patients hospitalized to Mount Sinai Morningside Hospital, New York, NY due to COVID-19 infection who underwent clinically Univariate and multivariate regression analysis was used to explore the associations of clinical and echocardiographic variables with mortality. The study protocol was approved by Mount Sinai Institutional Review Board.",

There were no differences between the groups in the use of therapeutic anticoagulation (38% vs 39%, p=0.83) at the time of the echocardiographic examination.

Right ventricular hypokinesis (66% vs 5%, p = 0.01) and moderate or severe tricuspid regurgitation (21% vs 7%, p=0.05) were more prevalent in patients with right ventricular enlargement.
