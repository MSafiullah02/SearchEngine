            "text": "State-of-the-art biomedical research often uses rodents and other small animals for disease modeling. A recurring issue for many investigators is the desire to obtain anatomical and physiological information from valuable research animals without sacrificing them. In vivo imaging is a noninvasive way to gain insight into the animal's anatomy and physiology1; however, the unit cost and complexity of many such methods may preclude an investigator's ability to gain access to such devices. Location of the imaging equipment in a shared facility can overcome these obstacles. The vision of the NIH Mouse Imaging Facility (MIF) is to offer various state-of-the-art, in vivo small-animal imaging techniques in one facility. The MIF is a shared resource for the NIH intramural community, and currently has more than 70 active animal protocols. The MIF has three magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners, a micro X-ray computed tomography (CT) scanner, two ultrasound scanners, a combined luciferase/GFP imager, and a laser Doppler imager. In addition to administrative personnel, the staff consists of a veterinarian, three imaging scientists, an electrical engineer, and three animal technicians. Setting up this facility took planning and intellectual contributions from experts in many fields. We provide resources for a wide variety of investigators from many of the various institutes within the NIH. This is not a 'how-to' manual, but we will discuss some of the issues that the principal players considered when designing and staffing the MIF.",

This technology uses radio waves and powerful magnets to generate radio-graph-like images of tissue. A strong magnetic field partially aligns the hydrogen atoms on water molecules in the tissue. A radio wave then disturbs the built-up magnetization, and radio waves are in turn emitted as the magnetization returns to its starting place. These radio waves can be detected and used to construct an image (Fig. 1A). Unlike radiographs, the MRI patient is not exposed to X-ray radiation, so repeated imaging is not a risky procedure2.",

The fringe field is the distance that the surrounding magnetic field extends before it drops to the level of 5 gauss. The fringe field can occupy an area up to 250 ft2. The MRI suite must have a design that prevents casual visitors from entering the fringe field. A magnetic field >15 gauss can adversely affect persons with pacemakers or other metallic implants. The distance to the 15 gauss line varies widely with field strength and magnet type. There are magnets available that have a fringe field limited to a foot or less, but these cost more. MR scanners use extremely heavy magnets; therefore, most facilities locate the MR imager on the ground floor. Additionally, because the magnets are cooled by cryogens, good ventilation must be present. Rapid boil-off of the cryogens could lead to asphyxiation. The instrument manufacturer can provide a detailed description of space requirements and suggested architectural layouts. A facility will need to plan for additional space for the electronics and console for the scanner as well as a preparation area outside the magnetic field. This can amount to another 250 ft2.",

In our system, an X-ray source and detector rotate around the subject 360 degrees while generating a number of projections or views. The MIF has a MicroCat II CT scanner built by ImTek, Inc. (Knoxville, TN). Other manufacturers of micro-CT equipment include GE Medical Systems (London, Ontario, Canada), Scanco Medical (Scanco USA, Inc., Southeastern, PA), and SkyScan (Aartselaar, Belgium). Each projection is the equivalent of a radiographic image. A method called 'filtered back projection' permits these projections to be reconstructed into a three-dimensional (3D) data set. A micro-CT scanner for rodents typically uses less X-ray power than a conventional clinical CT scanner, so the effective radiation exposure per scan is reduced. The highest radiation dose we have measured was 35 rad for skin, but typical scans are much less (9 rad). The radiation dose is ultimately dependent on the scan parameters (i.e., number of projections, exposure time, X-ray beam strength).",

Optical imaging devices, which allow the user to monitor gene expression, are easy to operate and have no special environmental requirements. There are several different types of optical imaging. Bioluminescence is an enzymatic biochemical process that produces light. The luciferase gene is first inserted into the targeted cell population. Image acquisition requires live cells to process the substrate and produce light. Advantages of bioluminescence include high sensitivity, and virtually no background noise; disadvantages include the need for cofactors (i.e., oxygen, magnesium, and ATP) and expensive substrates (luciferin). Fluorescence imaging also requires genetic manipulation; however, the technology does not require a living system to produce an image. Fluorescence imaging differs from bioluminescence in that light must be applied to the tissue to generate a signal. One advantage of fluorescence imaging is the commercial availability of numerous markers (GFP, DsRed, ICG, and Cy5.5) with no need for substrate or cofactors; a disadvantage is the low signal/noise ratio due to autofluorescence.",

Image acquisition is simple, and it is not necessary to have a dedicated system operator. Investigators can easily learn to perform their own imaging study. Our system's operating software first acquires a black-and-white photographic image of the subject, then acquires the luminescent image, and finally overlays the image onto the photograph for anatomical signal mapping (Fig. 2). Both bioluminescence and fluorescence imaging are useful to detect tumor cells, monitor tumor growth, or track cell movement (e.g., metastasis). Optical imaging can be highly specific, but it has low spatial resolution. Optical data are typically two-dimensional (2D), but 3D methods are in development.

As the sound waves encounter the interfaces between various types of tissue, they are reflected. The transducer detects the reflected sound waves and uses them to construct an image (Fig. 4). The depth of penetration depends on the frequency of the sound wave. The image-processing software produces an image in real time, and the various tissues within the image display different 'echogenic' properties.",

Resolution increases (and field of view decreases) as the ultrasound frequency increases; therefore, high-frequency ultrasound is ideal for rodents. Ultrasound is excellent for cardiac studies and evaluation of embryonic development12,13. It may also be used for various organ evaluations, tumors, and guided injections. Advantages of ultrasound include rapid image acquisition and ease of use; however, time is required for the operator to develop proficiency in the acquisition techniques and image interpretation. Knowledge of anatomy is useful for positioning the transducers, as well as evaluating the resulting images. A well-trained operator should be able to distinguish normal and abnormal anatomy. Scattering of the sound waves in the tissue often cause ultrasound images to appear 'noisy'. Also, most ultrasound images are 2D, although some 3D-capable instruments are available. Most ultrasound machines are built on portable carts for easy relocation. The image display is most clearly visible in low ambient light, so this should be a consideration when determining the location for ultrasound imaging.",

The imaging area should be in a location that allows the environment to be properly controlled and appropriate precautions taken. Your institution should be able to provide a detailed description of the rules and regulations that govern the use of radionuclides. The imaging animals will remain radioactive for some time after imaging, so housing for these 'hot' animals must be considered. The half-lives of radionuclides in the radioactive compounds are typically short (e.g., 18 hours), so housing animals can be a temporary situation. The availability of radioactive compounds will have the greatest impact on the success of a micro-PET program. Radiolabeled glucose, oxygen, and ammonia are commercially available; however, many studies may need custom-made radioactive compounds. The ideal arrangement is an imaging suite located adjacent to the radiopharmacy that will produce the radionuclides. Production of these reagents can represent the largest expense because of the need for highly specific equipment and personnel. Manufacturers of micro-Pet imagers include General Electric and Philips Medical Systems. Micro-PET operation will also require a postdoctorate-level scientist to assemble, operate, and maintain the equipment.",

At the MIF, we train investigators to perform simple data analysis. For more complex data analysis, MIF staff collaborates with the investigators.
