The 20.4% total case fatality rate (CFR) in the Korean MERS outbreak was lower than that in the Arabian Peninsula.3 However, the CFR differed among clusters in Korea. For example, the CFR of St. Mary\u2019s hospital in Pyeongtaek (Hospital P) was 16.7%,4 whereas that of the Daejeon cluster was 44.0%. From May 2015 to June 2015, Daejeon, a metropolitan city in Korea, experienced an outbreak of MERS based around two hospitals, hospital A and hospital B, and recorded a higher CFR than the overall CFR in Korea.",

Chest radiographs showed the progression of pneumonia from May 22 to 28. The chest image in hospital B on May 28 showed aggravation of pneumonia compared with those obtained in hospital A. On the second day of admission in hospital B, he received lidocaine inhalation in his admission room using a jet nebulizer and then underwent a bronchoscopy in a separate examination room. Medical staff in the bronchoscopy room wore surgical masks, gloves, and vinyl gowns.

An activated host immune response to viral infection may also increase the CFR, similar to the observed neutrophilic response in SARS cases with poor prognoses.19, 20 Moreover, since aggravated pulmonary infiltration may induce dyspnea and sputum, these symptoms may be predictive of higher CFR.
