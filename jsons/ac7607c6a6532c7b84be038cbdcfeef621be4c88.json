The urgent need for effective vaccines and therapies is leading to a rapid rise in the number of high resolution structures of SARS-CoV-2 proteins that collectively reveal critical targets on the virus and a map of vulnerabilities. To enable structure-based design of vaccines and therapeutics, as well as insights into structural and molecular features of coronaviruses, we have developed the CoV3D database, which provides a view of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus protein structures, updated on a weekly basis. This database includes and annotates structures of coronavirus proteins and their complexes with antibodies, receptors, and small molecules. Additionally, CoV3D provides information on spike glycoprotein sequence variability and polymorphisms, mapping these features onto the spike structure, and includes spike structures with modeled glycosylation. CoV3D is available at: https://cov3d.ibbr.umd.edu.",

These high resolution protein structures are of immense importance for understanding viral assembly and for rational vaccine design. The first structures of SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike glycoproteins were reported in February and early March 2020 (Walls et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020) . These are the major target of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and antibody therapeutics, and previously determined spike glycoprotein structures have enabled advances including rational design of CoV spike glycoproteins with proline substitutions to stabilize the prefusion conformation, yielding improved protein expression and immunogenicity (Pallesen et al., 2017) . Given that the rapid rate of coronavirus protein structural determination and deposition is likely to continue, and their importance to the research community, a simple and updated resource detailing these structures would provide a useful reference.",

Structures are identified from the PDB on a weekly basis using NCBI BLAST command line tools (Camacho et al., 2009) Structural visualization is performed using NGL viewer (Rose and Hildebrand, 2015) . SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein sequences and sequence information were downloaded from NCBI Virus (Hatcher et al., 2017) , followed by filtering out sequences with missing residues. Sequence polymorphism information was obtained by BLAST search using a reference SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein sequence (QHD43416.1). To develop spike glycoprotein alignments, betacoronavirus spike glycoprotein sequences were downloaded from NCBI Virus and aligned with Clustal Omega (Sievers et al., 2011) in SeaView (Gouy et al., 2010) . Sequences that were redundant (>95% similarity) or contained missing residues were removed, with the remaining 70 sequences forming the Pan-betacoronavirus alignment. A subset of 18 sequences from the pan-betacoronavirus alignment was used to generate the SARS-like sequence alignment, which contains every sequence from the pan-betacoronavirus alignment with >70% sequence similarity to the SARS-CoV-2 spike. Sequence logos are generated dynamically for user-specified residue ranges using the command-line version of WebLogo (Crooks et al., 2004) . N-glycans are modeled onto spike glycoprotein structures using a glycan modeling and refinement protocol in Rosetta (Labonte et al., 2017 ). An example command line and Rosetta Script for this glycan modeling protocol is provided as Supplemental Information.",

The SARS-like logo highlights the high conservation of this region of the spike glycoprotein, providing a mechanistic basis for the cross-reactive binding exhibited by CR3022 for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs (Yuan et al., 2020) .

Under \"Sequences\", users can navigate to \"Spike Polymorphisms\" where a table is shown with observed single and multiple substitutions in the spike glycoprotein, along with the counts of sequences containing them. The D614G variant is currently the most prevalent, with more occurrences than the reference sequence represented in spike glycoprotein structures (923 sequences, versus 637 sequences). The position of this substitution on the spike glycoprotein can provide some indication of its possible structural and functional impact. By clicking \"view\" next to this substitution, users can visualize the position of this substitution, showing that it is located on the spike surface, and is not located within or adjacent to the receptor binding domain (RBD; Figure 2A) . However, this site is closer to the RBD than the site of another less prevalent SARS-CoV-2 spike variant (T791I; Figure 2B ).",

Experimentally reported protein structures often lack full N-glycans due to limitations from resolution or intrinsic glycan dynamics or heterogeneity. To enable visualization and additional analysis or modeling of glycosylated spike glycoproteins, CoV3D includes sets of structures with modeled N-glycans at all predicted glycosylation sites, with N-glycans built onto the glycoprotein structures and refined using a protocol in Rosetta (Labonte et al., 2017) . Examples of glycosylated structures that can be visualized in CoV3D are shown in Figure 3 , and these can be downloaded directly by users for further processing. This permits users to view features such as the amount of N-glycosylation present on the ACE2 surface ( Figure 3A ) and the relatively high glycosylation of the spike glycoprotein base (bottom in Figure 3B ) versus the RBD. Presently, these structures include oligomannose glycans that were found to be prevalent on the SARS-CoV spike based on previous mass spectroscopy analysis (Ritchie et al., 2010) , with five branched mannose sugars. In the future, we plan to include more glycosylated structures, with additional options for glycan sizes and types.",

This will allow researchers to identify and classify new coronavirus protein structures as they are released, particularly for SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, and it can enable insights into sequence features, polymorphisms, as well as glycosylation. A recent study combining coronavirus structural and sequence analysis revealed insights regarding the determinants of ACE2 recognition (Wan et al., 2020) , and CoV3D can enable prospective comparative studies, in addition to modeling and structure-based design efforts. This database will likely be of interest to virologists, computational biologists, immunologists, and those interested in learning about and targeting SARS-CoV-2 proteins with small molecules and antibodies, as well as those engaged in vaccine design.
