Invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) is associated with adverse events such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, ventilator-induced lung injury, and the potential for oversedation [4\u20136]. Avoiding unnecessary endotracheal intubation remains a major goal in the management of patients with AHRF [7\u20139]. Multiple noninvasive oxygenation strategies have been identified that might help avoid endotracheal intubation and decrease mortality, but it remains unclear which of these is most effective [9].",

            "text": "Previous studies have aimed to identify the optimal initial oxygenation strategy to avoid the receipt of invasive mechanical ventilation in adults with AHRF but have often produced conflicting results [10\u201314]. Classically, standard oxygen therapy (SOT) has been the conventional approach evaluated. Standard oxygen therapy provides low-flow oxygen (< 15 L/min) using different interfaces such as nasal prongs, Venturi system, and non-rebreather masks. In the early 2000s, noninvasive ventilation provided by a face mask (FM-NIV) was shown to be superior to SOT in two small single-center randomized controlled trials (RCT) [10, 11]. In 2015, a large RCT failed to show superiority of FM-NIV on the rates of endotracheal intubation and all-cause mortality compared to SOT in immunocompromised patients [12]. More recently, the use of high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) gained interest and use among clinicians as an alternative method to provide noninvasive oxygenation [15\u201317]. A large 3-arm RCT recently compared the efficacy of HFNC, FM-NIV, and SOT in adults with AHRF [13]. Although this study did not show a benefit in the primary outcome (invasive mechanical ventilation at 28 days), HFNC was associated with decreased all-cause mortality at 90 days. Furthermore, a post hoc subgroup analysis showed that in patients with severe hypoxemia (PaO2:FiO2 < 200 mmHg) HFNC decreased the need of invasive ventilation when compared with the other two modalities. Notably, the highest mortality was seen among the FM-NIV treatment arm. This study started to raise concerns for potential harmful effects associated with FM-NIV, which were further supported by two large observational studies [18, 19]. Potential mechanisms of harm attributable to FM-NIV as compared to HFNC include the poor tolerance of the face-mask interface, increased risk of patient-ventilator asynchrony, and the inability to limit tidal volumes leading to high transpulmonary pressures and ventilator- and patient-inflicted lung injury [20\u201322]. As a result, recent guidelines have expressed uncertainty regarding the use of FM-NIV for the treatment of de novo AHRF [7]. Interestingly, in a subsequent study comparing HFNC vs SOT among immunocompromised patients, there were no differences noted in rates of invasive mechanical ventilation or mortality [14].",

The potential benefits of H-NIV compared to SOT and FM-NIV to decrease the risk of ETI has been supported by recent RCTs [24\u201327]. In an RCT study conducted in 2010, H-NIV was found to decrease mortality and need for invasive mechanical ventilation compared to SOT in patients with hematologic malignancy [26]. Helmet-NIV was also found to decrease rates of invasive mechanical ventilation and mortality in a more recent single-center RCT compared to FM-NIV [25]. There are a series of physiologic mechanisms that may explain these results\u2014predominantly related to the helmet interface. The helmet interface may act to decrease air leaks when compared to the face mask interface. This may permit more effective delivery of higher levels of positive end-expiratory pressure potentially increasing alveolar recruitment and decreasing respiratory drive [2, 8, 22, 27]. Furthermore, patients with AHRF seem to have better tolerance for a helmet interface minimizing the time that the therapy requires interruption\u2014something not uncommon for FM-NIV [25]. Interestingly, there are currently no available head to head comparisons of H-NIV and HFNC for relevant clinical outcomes such as mortality and need for invasive mechanical ventilation.",

The limitations of the current evidence are clearly reflected in clinical practice, where there exists high variability among clinicians in the use of these four noninvasive oxygenation strategies for AHRF [8]. Furthermore, although previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses have explored the effectiveness of HFNC in patients with AHRF, these studies have often pooled control group data as \u201cany other strategy,\u201d failing to account for the important physiologic and clinical differences of these alternative interventions [28\u201330].",

Analyses will be based on Markov chain Monte Carlo methods using prior distributions for event rates derived from previous literature, minimally informative treatment effect estimates, and informative prior distributions for heterogeneity estimates derived from external evidence [38]. We will report pairwise and NMA treatment effect estimates as risk ratios (RR), estimating summary treatment effect estimates from the median and corresponding 95% credible intervals (CrIs) from the 2.5th and 97.5th percentile of the posterior distribution. We will also rank interventions according to their apparent effectiveness and will calculate the probability that interventions have risk reductions or increases greater compared to standard oxygen therapy. We will quantify heterogeneity in treatment effects between studies using the posterior distribution \u03c42. Inconsistency (incoherence) between direct and indirect comparisons will be estimated using the node-splitting approach contrasting estimates from both direct and indirect evidence [39, 40].
