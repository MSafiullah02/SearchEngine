Although the attack rate among HCWs was reported to be lower than patients and family contacts, 13 HCWs represented a significant proportion of all detected cases of MERS-CoV in the current study and elsewhere. One-third of the confirmed cases in the current outbreak were HCWs. This was similar to what was observed in the Jeddah outbreak, where 31% of the 255 confirmed cases were HCWs. 14 Additionally, 40% of the 55 MERS-CoV cases reviewed in the United Arab Emirates were HCWs. 15 However, it was considerably higher than seen in other outbreaks: 13% in the Eastern region outbreak and 14% in the Korean outbreak. 5, 8 Additionally, a review of the 99 cases detected after more than 5,000 screenings over a year in Saudi Arabia found that 19% were HCWs. 13 One reason that may explain the high proportion of HCWs at the time of outbreak, including in the current study, is the active screening for patient contacts, mass screening of certain units that harbor patients, and proactive screening of anxious HCWs. Additionally, the higher than expected (from previous outbreaks) number of community cases of MERS-CoV may have amplified transmission and increased the risk of HCWs. More than half of the healthcare-acquired infections in the current study were identified in the ED, a 150-bed multisection complex that served more than 800 visits per day during the outbreak. Factors that facilitated the spread of infection in and from the ED included the extreme overcrowding, uncontrolled patient movement, high visitor traffic, non-strict compliance with infection control recommendations, late recognition/isolation of some cases, and HCWs serving on both ED and other hospital locations. This was closely similar to the conditions believed to have contributed to the rapid spread of MERS-CoV in several hospitals in Saudi Arabia and South Korea. 4, 16 For example, combinations of several contributing factors, such as crowded ED environment, close and unprotected contacts with a symptomatic case, and possibly fomite transmission, have been suggested as causes in the Korean outbreak. 16 Additionally, the ED received during the outbreak more than the expected number of community cases of MERS-CoV, which amplified ED transmission. This observation is also supported by the fact that there was an immediate decrease in new cases just after closure of the ED. Moreover, the commitment of KAMC-R to care for eligible patients regardless of the availability of beds and for noneligible cases in case of emergency, in addition to the lack of a divergence system, made this outbreak inevitable with difficult containment.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 217, "end": 219, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 604, "end": 606, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 740, "end": 742, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 743, "end": 744, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 880, "end": 882, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1974, "end": 1976, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1977, "end": 1979, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2215, "end": 2217, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "discussion"}, {"text": "The current study reconfirmed significant differences between the MERS-CoV course and outcome among patients and HCWs at a healthcare setting. Obviously, HCWs were younger, healthier, and with fewer comorbidities. Additionally, HCWs had a less severe version of the disease, as indicated by the higher frequency of asymptomatic cases and probable diagnosis. This may have reflected more intensive ascertainment rather than different disease behavior. For example, HCWs working in areas like ED and the dialysis unit were mass-screened to detect cases that otherwise would have been missed. Additionally, anxious HCWs were closely monitoring their symptoms and sought help frequently before they turned positive. This explanation was supported by the lack of major differences in the frequency of fever and respiratory symptoms among symptomatic cases of both patients and HCWs. One of the most striking finding of the current study, yet previously reported, is the high mortality among patients and lack of such mortality among HCWs. Similarly, there was higher mortality among confirmed cases (mainly patients) than probable cases (mainly HCWs). This may reflect the younger age, better health, and earlier diagnosis among HCWs. This difference may reflect a detection bias that is typically seen in hospital outbreaks and may not be controlled except in a planned study design. The current 39% overall mortality and 59% patient mortality were similar to the Jeddah outbreak, where overall mortality was 36% and patient mortality was 59%. 14 Additionally, the overall mortality among accumulated cases in Saudi Arabia during the past 3 years was 43%. 2 However, the current mortality numbers were much higher than reported in the Korean outbreak, where 36 (19%) of the 186 died. 8 Interestingly, the mortality was 40% in the first half of the Korean outbreak before it significantly decreased at the end of outbreak. 17 This was explained by the possibility of a better ascertainment rate and the infection of younger, healthier individuals in the second half of the outbreak. 17 The mortality difference between the current and the Korean outbreaks may also reflect the higher comorbidity (80% vs 55%) and symptomatic disease (81% vs 74% for fever and 68% vs 18% for cough) in the current outbreak compared with the Korean outbreak. 8 The current outbreak reemphasizes the fact that MERS-CoV remains a major threat to advanced healthcare settings with a high possibility of hospital outbreaks. These outbreaks are costly in terms of lives, healthcare resources, and health service continuity.
