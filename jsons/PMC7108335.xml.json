            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), an enveloped, positive-stranded RNA virus of the Coronaviridae family (Rota et al., 2003, Peiris et al., 2003). The genome of SARS-CoV encodes several structural proteins including the spike (S) glycoprotein, nucleocapsid protein, membrane protein and envelope protein (Marra et al., 2003). Membrane fusion between SARS-CoV and the host cell is mediated by its S glycoprotein (Li et al., 2003, Xiao et al., 2003, Dimitrov, 2003, Wong et al., 2004, Wang et al., 2004, Sui et al., 2004), which consists of 1255 amino acid residues with approximately 25% homology to that of the other human CoVs (Spiga et al., 2003, Ho et al., 2004). The S1 subunit (amino acids 1\u2013680) of the S glycoprotein contains a receptor-binding domain and is apparently the main target for neutralizing Abs in patient sera (Xiao et al., 2003, Sui et al., 2004, Wong et al., 2004, Wang et al., 2004, Babcock et al., 2004). Western blot (WB) and indirect immunofluorescence assays have been developed for detection of Abs against the S protein (Tan et al., 2004, Chang et al., 2004, Wu et al., 2004, Woo et al., 2004, Ho et al., 2004, He et al., 2004). However, so far there is no enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) available for easier and more sensitive detection of anti-S Abs. Our computer-assisted analysis suggested that amino acid residues 450\u2013650 of the S glycoprotein (S450-650) of SARS-CoV is largely solvent accessible and likely to contain dominant B cell epitopes. This coincided with recently published results by Lu et al. (2004) showing that residues 441\u2013700 of the S protein of SARS-CoV contained dominant epitope(s) for anti-S Abs in patient sera, as determined in WB assays. Sequences outside the 441\u2013700 region were relatively poorly recognized by patient sera (Lu et al., 2004). It is also supported by findings of Zhou et al. (2004) that residues 485\u2013625 of the S protein of SARS-CoV elicited neutralizing Abs against the virus. In this study, the S450-650 fragment was expressed in E. Coli and used as Ag in an ELISA system for detection of anti-S Abs.",

The blood samples were processed within 18 h of collection. All patient sera were tested for anti-SARS-CoV IgG Abs using an ELISA kit produced by Huada Institute (see below). A total of 45 serum samples from 18 patients, randomly selected from the above patient group, were tested using our S450-650-based ELISA kit.
