The hallmark microscopic lesions of MHD are transmural haemorrhages in the heart muscle and severe necrosis of heart muscle fibres (Sharp et al., 1972b). This disease and its associated lesions are known by other names such as microangiopathy (MAP) (Rice and Kennedy, 1989; Korpela, 1990a, 1990b, 1991) and white muscle disease (Mahan et al., 1973). In 2007, swine practitioners and producers observed a marked increase in MHD in nursery pigs across the United States. (personal communication Dr. R. B. Baker). Typically, pigs were affected 5\u20137 days after arrival into the nursery, and the mortality was usually 2\u20135% regardless of the intervention strategies used such as vitamin E and selenium supplementation of sows and piglets and preventive antibiotic treatment before and after shipment.",

A higher frequency of MHD was observed in pigs fed low\u2010level selenium diets containing torula yeast (Sharp et al., 1972a) and MHD has been experimentally reproduced with diets deficient in vitamin E and selenium (Van Vleet, 1982). In the field, gross lesions such as a heart resembling the appearance of a mulberry, fluid accumulation in the pericardial sac and sudden death are reported conditions of vitamin E and selenium deficiency in pigs (Mahan et al., 1973). A retrospective analysis was conducted on vitamin E and selenium levels in liver in 37 and 26 cases, respectively. Only 25% of the pigs diagnosed as having MHD had low liver levels (<2 ppm) of vitamin E (Pallar\u00e9s et al., 2002), and all pigs had adequate levels of selenium. Supplemental vitamin E and selenium resulted in a reduction in the incidence of lesions including myocardial degeneration, skeletal muscle degeneration and exudative diathesis by approximately 50% (Sharp et al., 1972b).",

In pigs that died of MHD or microangiopathy, significantly (P < 0.001) higher myocardial and hepatic iron concentrations were found (Korpela, 1990b). Similarly, myocardial and hepatic calcium concentration in MHD\u2010affected pigs was significantly (P < 0.001) higher than in pigs with other diseases and in healthy slaughter pigs (Korpela, 1991). On the other hand, myocardial and hepatic magnesium concentrations in pigs with microangiopathy were significantly (P < 0.001) lower than in pigs with other diseases and in healthy slaughter pigs (Korpela, 1991). These results suggested that iron, calcium and magnesium concentrations may play a role in the development of MHD (Korpela, 1990b, 1991).",

            "text": "It is possible that there are known and unknown pathogens that may be involved in inducing MHD\u2010like lesions in pigs. Different bacteria have been reported to be isolated in cases with necrotizing myocarditis resembling MHD, including Escherichia coli, which is the most common organism (Trapp et al., 1970), and Streptococcus suis type 2 from hearts of pigs aged 3\u20135 weeks (Sanford, 1987). Viral pathogens are also capable of causing MHD\u2010like lesions in pigs, such as porcine circovirus (PCV) type 2 (PCV2) (West et al., 1999) and porcine parvovirus (PPV) (Bolt et al., 1997). Cases of heart failure without the hallmark lymphoid lesions associated with PCV2 (lymphoid depletion and histiocytic replacement of follicles) are rarely tested for the presence of PCV2. However, high amounts of PCV2 in areas of myocardial necrosis in cases consistent with MHD but with normal vitamin E and selenium concentrations have recently been observed (Opriessnig et al., 2006). The prevalence of PPV\u2010associated lesions in growing pigs is not known because laboratory testing for PPV is usually limited to mummified foetuses. Finally, the determination of involvement of porcine enterovirus (PEV) in cases of heart failure is typically not carried out despite having a PCR available and frequently using it on suspected enterovirus\u2010associated CNS cases. Recently, a new disease termed \u2018porcine myocarditis syndrome\u2019 was reported in Australia (McOrist et al., 2004). The cause is believed to be Bungowannah virus (BGWV) that is assumed to be a new species of pestivirus (Kirkland et al., 2007). Nevertheless, the role of these organisms is difficult to assess because many are considered secondary or opportunistic pathogens. It is also possible that many of the cases diagnosed as MHD are not associated with vitamin E or selenium deficiency but are associated with acute viral infection.",

It is generally accepted that MHD is caused by a deficiency of selenium and/or vitamin E in feed (Sharp et al., 1972a, 1972b; Mahan et al., 1973; Van Vleet, 1982). However, this is not always the case as shown in a study comparing the concentration of vitamin E and selenium in feed for MHD (microangiopathy)\u2010affected pigs and control pigs where both diets contained adequate amounts of vitamin E and selenium (Rice and Kennedy, 1989). Similarly, in Denmark, MHD persisted among young pigs even though abundant supplies of selenium and vitamin E were added to feedstuffs for sows and pigs (Nielsen et al., 1989). In the present study, analysis of feed samples revealed that the selenium concentration for all samples was above the 0.3 ppm legal supplementation limit, and all vitamin E levels were above 20 IU/Kg. Based on these results, it is not likely that a deficiency of selenium and vitamin E is the cause of MHD in the present study. MHD may be a vitamin E\u2010 and selenium\u2010responsive condition in pigs but evidence continues to build indicating MHD is not because of a deficiency of either vitamin E or selenium in the diet.",

            "text": "The level of vitamin E (alpha\u2010tocopherol) in tissue is an important parameter to measure to further investigate the role of vitamin E in the occurrence of MHD. In spite of apparently adequate amounts of dietary alpha\u2010tocopherol, previous results indicate that pigs with MHD (microangiopathy) had lower tissue alpha\u2010tocopherol concentrations than the control pigs (Rice and Kennedy, 1989). Investigation of MHD cases revealed that mean liver vitamin E concentrations were lower in pigs with MHD than in pigs that died of causes other than MHD (Pallar\u00e9s et al., 2002). In cases submitted to the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory at Iowa State University from 1999 to 2009, only 24.6% (30/122) of the MHD cases were actually deficient in liver concentrations of vitamin E, and similarly only 5.6% (6/106) cases were deficient in liver concentrations of selenium. The concentrations of selenium and vitamin E in the liver and heart tissues of young pigs that died suddenly and had characteristic lesions of MHD were not significantly different from the concentrations found in pigs of the same age that had died from other causes (Nielsen et al., 1989). In the present study, in heart tissues, more pigs in the L\u2010NEG group had deficient levels of vitamin E compared to L\u2010POS pigs (8/33 L\u2010POS; 23/40 L\u2010NEG). This pattern was similar for liver tissues where a total of 40 pigs were deficient in vitamin E (11 L\u2010POS; 29 L\u2010NEG). This study does indicate a close association of heart and liver concentrations of vitamin E. As the concentration of vitamin E in the liver changed, the heart concentration also changed. With this information, it is difficult to associate MHD with a vitamin E deficiency as this study clearly provides evidence that pigs affected by MHD (L\u2010POS) had high levels of vitamin E in tissues similar to levels in pigs with no lesions of MHD (L\u2010NEG).",

In one experimental study, tissue selenium concentration did not appear to be related to the incidence of MHD\u2010related lesions (Sharp et al., 1972b). In Western Australia, hepatic selenium concentrations were not low in pigs with MHD (Moir and Masters, 1979). In field cases, heart and kidney selenium concentrations were similar in pigs of either group, i.e. spontaneous MHD (microangiopathy) and control pigs (Rice and Kennedy, 1989), and liver selenium concentrations were adequate in all pigs including MHD cases and non\u2010MHD cases (Pallar\u00e9s et al., 2002). In pigs that died of MHD (microangiopathy), hepatic selenium concentration in pigs was lower than levels found in healthy pigs (Korpela, 1990a). In the present study, there were no significant differences in selenium levels in heart tissue; however, there was a significant (P < 0.05) difference in selenium in liver tissues. Even though the significant difference exists, the level of selenium for MHD pigs is not considered deficient, in fact it is considered within the adequate range (0.1\u20132.9 ppm). Of all the livers tested, the selenium levels were considered adequate in 71/73 and within the toxic range (3.0\u2013120 ppm) in 2/73. This is not surprising when looking at the 22 feed samples, where all were above the legal supplementation limit. Selenium does occur naturally in corn and soy diets, which are the most common in swine rations; however, the level of selenium that naturally occurs in these diets is not higher than 0.1 ppm. When taking this into consideration, 19/22 feed rations were still above the legal supplementation limit as defined by the food and drug administration (FDA). It is most likely the excess selenium observed in these rations was because of added selenium, not naturally occurring selenium in the diet.",

In this study, none of the pathogens detected could be clearly linked to MHD; however, there are a number of viruses in humans that have been shown to cause lesions in humans similar to MHD in pigs (Chariot et al., 1997; Ramanathan and Taylor, 1997; Beck et al., 2003). These viruses, which also cause selenium deficiencies in the infected persons, include human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 1 and HIV2, Coxsackievirus B3 and several haemorrhagic fever viruses, most notably Ebola Zaire (Chariot et al., 1997; Ramanathan and Taylor, 1997; Taylor et al., 1997; Zhang et al., 1999; Beck et al., 2003). Furthermore, while the data were not strong enough to point to a definitive pathogen associated with MHD, there did seem to be a relationship between MHD and PEV and pan\u2010herpesvirus. This is especially interesting because of the link between certain viruses in other species and their associated clinical signs that are common to MHD (Chariot et al., 1997; Ramanathan and Taylor, 1997; Taylor et al., 1997; Zhang et al., 1999; Beck et al., 2003).",

Interestingly, we found that supplementation of vitamin E and selenium in feed above recommended and in some cases legal limits was not uncommon on farms experiencing MHD, and in some cases, these were approaching levels where it may become toxic to the pig. It is possible that there are several different causes of MHD\u2010like lesions based on our observation of significantly higher levels of sodium in heart and liver, and lower levels of copper in heart, magnesium in liver and phosphorus in liver in MHD pigs. We also found some evidence that may warrant further investigation of the relationship between MHD and PEV and pan\u2010herpesvirus.",
