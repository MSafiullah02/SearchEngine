First reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012 (Zaki, van Boheemen, Bestebroer, Osterhaus, & Fouchier, 2012), this infectious viral respiratory disease causes high mortality and morbidity in humans. Worldwide, there have been 2,399 cases, with a 34.47% mortality rate (World Health Organization, 2019a). In Saudi Arabia, the most affected country, there have been 2,008 cases, with a 37.30% mortality rate. Currently, human MERS\u2010CoV infections are reported monthly in Saudi Arabia.",

Dromedaries are natural hosts of MERS\u2010CoV, and transmission to humans can occur through sporadic zoonotic infection after direct or indirect exposure to infected dromedary camels or their products (Azhar et al., 2014; Kayali & Peiris, 2015; Memish et al., 2014; Omrani, Al\u2010Tawfiq, & Memish, 2015; Sikkema et al., 2019).

(2016) evaluated variances in environmental exposures among 30 primary laboratory\u2010confirmed MERS\u2010CoV cases and 116 controls; they observed that direct exposure to dromedary camels was independently associated with primary MERS\u2010CoV infection.",

They also found that in camel\u2010exposed individuals, seroprevalence was significantly higher (15 and 23 times) in shepherds and slaughterhouse workers, respectively, compared with the general population in the study. However, only 2.4% of the 87 samples from shepherds and 3.6% of the 140 samples from slaughterhouse workers had serological evidence of infection. Another study conducted in Saudi Arabia reported higher MERS\u2010CoV seroprevalence (53%) in camel workers using a cohort of 30 camel workers from the Riyadh New Camel Market and 44 controls from Saudi Arabia and the United States (Alshukairi et al., 2018).

The wild dromedary camel was likely domesticated in the Arabian Peninsula 5,000\u20136,000 years ago (Uerpmann & Uerpmann, 2002). Approximately 1.6 million dromedary camels inhabit this area, with approximately 53% located in Saudi Arabia (Abdallah & Faye, 2013). The population has grown by 5.2% each year since 1961 (Food & Agriculture Organization, 2014). Raising camels is part of the Saudi Arabian sociocultural heritage; they are also used for traditional races and festivals (Abdallah & Faye, 2013; Auty, 2001). Increasing demand for camel milk and meat has led to the establishment of peri\u2010urban dromedary camel husbandry, and these increased interactions between camels and humans introduce a risk of transmission of zoonotic diseases, such as MERS\u2010CoV, to humans (Gikonyo et al., 2018).",

Additionally, there is a higher risk of human MERS\u2010CoV infection during winter than in summer (Kasem et al., 2018; Khalafalla et al., 2015), driven by many seasonal activities, such as breeding, calving and racing (Abbas, Al Qarawi, & Al Hawas, 2000; Gossner et al., 2016; Padalino, Monaco, & Lacalandra, 2015).",

Associations were more significant for those who had a history of direct contact with camels. In past decades, peri\u2010urban camel farming and camel festivals have attracted increased public interest in the Arabian Peninsula. In addition, camel dairy production and human consumption of camel products, including unpasteurized camel milk, have also dramatically increased. These changes could have significantly contributed to the massive spread of MERS\u2010CoV within camel herds and the emergence of this zoonotic disease in humans (Faye, 2013; Faye, Madani, & El\u2010Rouili, 2014; Gossner et al., 2016; Reusken et al., 2014). The results also reveal that primary MERS\u2010CoV infection and juvenile male camels are significantly linked, which could be due to their higher viral MERS\u2010CoV RNA load compared with female camels (Alagaili et al., 2014; Elfadil et al., 2018; Hemida et al., 2013; Kasem et al., 2018).",

This is consistent with the projected large proportion of MERS\u2010CoV seropositive individuals (asymptomatic human carriers) reported for Riyadh (46.7%) by Muller et al. (2015). Interestingly, Najran province, most of which is rural, had a very high camel density in relation to the human population and the highest incidence rate and excess risk ratio of primary MERS\u2010CoV infection in the country. Additionally, most of the primary MERS\u2010CoV cases in this province had been previously exposed to camels, which indicates that areas with high camel density are more likely to be hotspots for MERS\u2010CoV transmission (Gikonyo et al., 2018).",

The fact that camel\u2010related activities, such as camel trading, shepherding, slaughtering and animal waste sanitation, are primarily carried out by middle\u2010aged and elderly men supports our findings. We also found that in most Saudi Arabian provinces, the largest proportion of human primary MERS\u2010CoV cases occurred during spring and winter, when camel breeding, calving, mobilization and interactions are more frequent (Padalino et al., 2015). Additionally, camel movements throughout the winter for grazing and participation in camel races and beauty festivals might be another contributing factor of camel\u2010to\u2010human MERS\u2010CoV transmission (Hemida, Elmoslemany, et al., 2017).",

Fortunately, in June 2019, the Saudi Ministry of Environment, Water, and Agriculture launched an electronic system for numbering and tracking camels using microchip implants to generate a national database (Ministry of Environment, Water, & Agriculture, 2019). This initiative will help improve the health status of camels through epidemiological mapping of camel\u2010related diseases to support timely, preventive interventions and effective control measures. Data from the new camel tracking system can be used for detailed investigations at lower spatial levels to study the spatiotemporal patterns of camel movements and human interactions.",
