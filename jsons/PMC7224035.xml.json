More, it has been showed that burnout prevalence, career dissatisfaction, and work\u2013life imbalance are higher among neurologists than physicians in most other specialties [11]. The care for specific neurologic illnesses requires more hours of dedication and intellectual and emotional engagement [12], such as a sense of failure and frustration when the patient\u2019s illness progresses, facing uncertainty in clinical practice, or a desire to separate from and avoid patients to escape these feelings [13]. Repeated exposure to these emotions and experience of distress contributes to the high levels of stress doctors experience in their profession. No specific studies were carried out to investigate the possible risk of BO and CF in carers for multiple sclerosis (MS), although it is possible to consider this condition among the neurological illnesses requiring more health providers\u2019 engagement. MS is increasing in Italy and worldwide, both in its incidence and prevalence [14, 15]; it predominantly affects young adults of female sex (female to male ratio 2.5:1 or greater), although the disease may begin in children [16] and subjects over the age of 60 [17]. The improvements in therapy for MS increased the complexity of care, requiring the management of a long-term disability, with a considerable variability of patients experience along the pathway of care [18\u201320].",

Together with validated tests and questionnaire, this activity can be carried out also through narrative medicine, which has been defined as the set of relationships between the health professional and the patient, starting from the collection of information on events before the disease, to how it has been diagnosed, focusing on psychological, social, and ontological implications for the patient [21, 22]. While evidence-based medicine (EBM) focuses on clinical processes and problem solving, narrative-based medicine (NBM) includes the person\u2019s experience in coping with distress [23]. The integration of EBM and NBM provides clinicians with fresh methods to fortify their clinical practice with narrative competences [24, 25]. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of narrative research to improve health care policies \u201cat the level of the individual, the health professional, the health care organization, and the health care system\u201d [26]. The narrative medicine tool for collecting health care providers\u2019 perspective is the \u201cparallel chart\u201d, which allows physicians to represent also their emotional reactions to clinical practice [27, 28].",

The test is composed of 30 items to be evaluated according to a score from 1 (never) to 5 (very often); specific steps have to be carried out, in order to obtain three scores, respectively related to CS, BO, and STS [31].

Finally, the lack of local networks increases the team\u2019s workload, for the impossibility to transfer some services of care on the territory. This situation can partially explain the not so positive result from the Satisfaction and Compassion Fatigue. Although the scores of CS and BO were \u201ctechnically\u201d positive, their values were close to the limit between positive and negative result, and the final section on the STS was clearly negative. More, analysing the details of these results, it is remarkable that neurologists revealed the lowest levels of CS and the highest risks of BO and STS. Integrating the test with the quantitative survey, they resulted the category with less time available and more precarious working conditions (all the fixed-term contracts were from neurologists).",

From the professional biographies, the concern about the uncertain working conditions was underlined; this uncertainty was not only referred to the contractual situation, but it was enlarged to the worry about current and future tendencies of the organizational setting of care, more and more challenging and stressing. More, from the parallel charts, a new element to understand the negative result of STS was given: more than 50% of the narratives concerned the people with MS\u2019 young age; this element was often underlined by the health care providers, who revealed to be particularly engaged in these relationships of care. Many recurring expressions were referred to the possible mirroring with young patients and the strong personal involvement. This evidence suggests an implicit request to receive more support in facing this daily emotional burden, to which probably the carers were not trained and prepared, considering that the decrease in people with MS\u2019 age comes from the recent revision of diagnostic guidelines allowing for early diagnosis, together with the evolution of the incidence and prevalence of the disease. Furthermore, the collected narratives represented a precious tool to express and give space to considerations and emotions in relating with patients\u2014illness centred narratives\u2014which in the ordinary professional settings can be repressed, contributing to increase the levels of stress. Indeed, the positive effect of the narrative medicine approach on daily practice and professional quality of life, preventing burnout, has been shown [36\u201338].",
