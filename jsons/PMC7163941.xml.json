DC\u2010SIGN consists of an N\u2010terminal cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane domain, an extracellular C\u2010terminal neck region and a C\u2010type carbohydrate\u2010recognition domain (CRD) [3]. Characteristic of C\u2010type lectins with the CRD containing an EPN (Glu\u2010Pro\u2010Asn) motif, the receptor recognizes glycans containing terminal nonreducing mannose (Man), N\u2010acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and fucose (Fuc) in a Ca2+\u2010dependent manner [4, 5, 6]. There are lines of evidence which indicate that, through this basic specificity, DC\u2010SIGN recognizes endogenous self, exogenous nonself or tumor\u2010specific ligands, and mediates various functions in the immune system. In the first line of evidence, DC\u2010SIGN was found to bind to immune cells in a carbohydrate\u2010dependent manner. In fact, DC\u2010SIGN was reported to recognize na\u00efve T cells through ICAM\u20103 in a LewisX\u2010dependent manner, resulting in the initiation of an adaptive immune response [2, 7]. DC\u2010SIGN also mediates interactions between DCs and neutrophils through binding to LewisX of Mac\u20101 expressed on neutrophils, and hence regulates DC maturation [8]. Second, DC\u2010SIGN recognizes invading pathogens via pathogen\u2010specific glycan structures, and acts as a scavenging receptor for them. These pathogens include viruses (HIV, Ebola and dengue), bacteria (Mycobacterium, Neisseria), fungi (Candida, Aspergillus) and parasitic protozoa (Leishmania, Schistosoma) [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. As a contrasting feature, DC\u2010SIGN has also been reported to function as a target for HIV entry, thus facilitating its infection [9]. Third, DC\u2010SIGN recognizes tumor\u2010specific glycans. DC\u2010SIGN has been reported to interact with carcinoembryonic antigen via Lewis structures expressed on colorectal cancer cells, and attenuates DC maturation [19, 20].",

Unlike the broad expression pattern of DC\u2010SIGN, DC\u2010SIGNR is exclusively expressed on endothelial cells in lymph\u2010node sinuses and on liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, but not on myeloid cells [22], whereas it showed a similar binding feature to DC\u2010SIGN (i.e. Man\u2010 and Fuc\u2010specificity) [4, 23]. DC\u2010SIGNR binds to and takes up exogenous ligands, including viruses (e.g. HIV and Ebola) and parasites (e.g. Schistosoma), and mediates HIV dissemination [10, 22, 23]. Similarly to DC\u2010SIGN, DC\u2010SIGNR also recognizes endogenous ligands, such as ICAM molecules [24], although their glycan epitopes have not been fully characterized.",

The receptor is specifically expressed on sinusoidal endothelial cells of human liver and lymph node, showing a distribution similar to that of DC\u2010SIGNR. Recently, however, LSECtin was found to be expressed in macrophages, DCs and Kupffer cells, where the lectin was reported to function as an endocytic receptor [26, 27]. LSECtin also functions as an attachment factor for viruses, such as Ebola virus, Marburgvirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV), but not for HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) [26, 28, 29]. In a more recent paper by Powlesland et al., [30] LSECtin was reported to bind to an Ebola virus surface glycoprotein through GlcNAc\u03b21\u20102Man structures. Undoubtedly, the DC\u2010SIGN\u2010related lectins mediate diverse functions in extensive immunobiological phenomena via the C\u2010type CRDs. However, there has been no report on the quantitative analysis of sugar\u2013protein interactions, in terms of affinity constants (K\nd or K\na), of DC\u2010SIGN, DC\u2010SIGNR and LSECtin.",

Further analysis by glycoconjugate arrays and cell\u2010based biological assays using flow cytometry confirmed the observed preferences of the lectins for agalactosylated N\u2010glycans.

It should be noted, however, that in this study we adopted substantially different conditions of lectin columns in terms of effective ligand content (Bt) (see below). Under such conditions with very different lectin densities, direct comparison of K\nd/K\na values among the three lectins may be inappropriate. Therefore, as a compromise, we used the term \u2018apparent\u2019 affinity, or app\nK\na/app\nK\nd (meaning it is restrictive to the given conditions) in relevant contexts throughout this paper.",

In fact, DC\u2010SIGN gave the highest affinity to 102 (app\nK\nd, 55 \u03bcm), where the GlcNAc residue is attached at the GnT\u2010I position of the trimannosyl core structure. The binding affinity to 102 was similar to that to 014 (55 \u03bcm), which showed the highest affinity among the high\u2010mannose\u2010type N\u2010glycans tested. By contrast, no detectable binding was observed for its positioning isomer, 101, containing the GlcNAc residue at the GnT\u2010II position. Other oligosaccharide structures containing the terminal GlcNAc residue at the GnT\u2010I position (202, 68 \u03bcm; 103, 104 \u03bcm; 304, 140 \u03bcm; 403, 156 \u03bcm; 203, 322 \u03bcm; 104, 492 \u03bcm) were also high\u2010affinity ligands for DC\u2010SIGN.

Addition of the GlcNAc residue at the GnT\u2010II position (e.g. 102 versus 103) resulted in only a moderate inhibitory effect, while the addition of the bisecting GlcNAc at the GnT\u2010III position greatly reduced the binding to approx. 20% (104). Addition of the GlcNAc residue at the GnT\u2010IV position (105) abolished the binding of DC\u2010SIGN, indicating that highly branched N\u2010glycans are not ligands for DC\u2010SIGN. No significant effect was observed for core fucosylation on DC\u2010SIGN binding (e.g. 103 versus 202).

We examined whether agalactosylated glycoproteins are internalized into cells expressing these C\u2010type lectin receptors. As a model ligand, we chose agalactosylated \u03b1AGP, which was recognized by DC\u2010SIGN\u2010related lectin\u2013Fc chimeras on a glycoconjugate microarray. \u03b1AGP was pretreated with both sialidase and \u03b2\u2010galactosidase, and the resulting agalactosylated \u03b1AGP was biotinylated. DC\u2010SIGN\u2010, DC\u2010SIGNR\u2010 and LSECtin\u2010expressing CHO cells were then incubated on ice for 1 h with the biotin\u2010labeled agalactosylated \u03b1AGP precomplexed with phycoerythrin (PE)\u2010conjugated streptavidin (10 \u03bcg\u00b7mL\u22121), and the temperature was raised to 37 \u00b0C to trigger internalization. The internalized fluorescence was detected by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 7A, agalactosylated \u03b1AGP was found to be internalized into all of the DC\u2010SIGN\u2010, DC\u2010SIGNR\u2010 and LSECtin\u2010expressing CHO cells, whereas the internalization was not observed for its intact (extensively sialylated) form. In the absence of CaCl2, no internalization was observed. Neither intact nor agalactosylated \u03b1AGP were internalized by parental CHO cells. When the transfected cell lines were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for prolonged periods of time (up to 120 min), the internalization levels of agalactosylated \u03b1AGP were found to increase over the incubation period (Fig. 7B).

However, each lectin showed distinct affinities to a variety of agalactosylated N\u2010glycans. We used C\u2010type CRDs fused with the Fc region of IgG, because the standard procedure, in which lectins are covalently immobilized on N\u2010hydroxysuccinimide\u2010activated Sepharose through primary amine groups [31], gave insufficient interaction for the DC\u2010SIGN\u2010related lectins tested. By contrast, the present procedure, using Fc\u2013chimera conjugates, yielded good results with sufficient availabilities of the immobilized ligands (i.e. 10\u201360%). However, there is still room for discussion about K\nd/K\na values determined in this work, which were basically defined for the disulfide\u2010linked homodimer of each C\u2010type CRD fused with an IgG Fc portion. The DC\u2010SIGN\u2010related lectins are thought to form relatively large multimers at the cell surface [6, 30]. In addition, the K\nd values are highly dependent on the experimental conditions, including temperature (in this work, 25 \u00b0C), flow rate (0.125 mL\u00b7min\u22121), lectin density (various) and lectin\u2010immobilization method (Fc chimera). In this study, the lectin densities were considerably different from one another. Hence, the affinity was expressed as \u2018apparent K\nd/K\na\u2019 throughout this manuscript. Nevertheless, the major conclusion reached in this work was that DC\u2010SIGN, DC\u2010SIGNR and LSECtin exhibited common binding affinity to mono\u2010 and/or bi\u2010antennary agalactosylated N\u2010glycans. Although affinity enhancement by multivalent lectin\u2013carbohydrate interaction is well documented, it is assumed that a simple 1 : 1 interaction, rather than multiple interactions, occurs under the FAC conditions used, because the oligosaccharide concentrations used for the analysis were low (2.5\u20135 nm). Moreover, accumulated evidence from crystallography suggests that multiple lectin\u2013oligosaccharide interactions, leading to affinity enhancement, does not seem to occur in the cases of DC\u2010SIGN and DC\u2010SIGNR and their counterpart glycan ligands (see below).",

            "text": "In the crystallographic analysis of DC\u2010SIGN with GlcNAc2Man3 (PDB code, 1k9i) [38], the trimannosyl core structure was found to form hydrogen bonds via Ca2+\u2010coordination with Glu347 and Asn349 in an EPN motif, as well as via van der Waals contact with Phe313. The terminal \u03b21\u20102GlcNAc residue on the \u03b11\u20103Man branch also forms both a hydrogen bond with Asn349 and van der Waals contact with Val351. In the structure of DC\u2010SIGNR (1k9j) [38], Asn361 in the EPN motif and Ser363 (Val351 in DC\u2010SIGN) makes hydrogen bonds with the terminal \u03b21\u20102GlcNAc residue. These observations support the present result that \u03b21\u20102GlcNAc at the GnT\u2010I position is critical for recognition by DC\u2010SIGN and DC\u2010SIGNR (Fig. S5). Crystallographic studies also revealed that the terminal \u03b21\u20102GlcNAc residue of the \u03b11\u20106Man branch forms hydrogen bonds and/or van der Waals contacts (Asn311 and Phe313 of DC\u2010SIGN; Asn323 and Phe325 of DC\u2010SIGNR). In the case of LSECtin, for which neither crystallographic analyses nor NMR studies have been reported, we used a modeling structure available from MODBASE published by Pieper et al. [39] (http://modbase.compbio.ucsf.edu/modbase-cgi/index.cgi). Comparison between LSECtin and DC\u2010SIGN CRDs (1k9i) indicated that the terminal \u03b21\u20102GlcNAc residue on the \u03b11\u20103Man branch would interact with Trp259, in addition to Ca2+\u2010coordinated hydrogen bonds to the \u03b11\u20103Man residue (Fig. S5). Trp259 of LSECtin corresponds to Val351 in DC\u2010SIGN and to Ser363 in DC\u2010SIGNR, indicating that Trp259 would be involved in the binding to the terminal \u03b21\u20102GlcNAc residue. Phe313 in DC\u2010SIGN and Phe325 in DC\u2010SIGNR also correspond to Arg219 in LSECtin, which probably interacts with the \u03b21\u20102GlcNAc residue on the \u03b11\u20106Man branch. In the present FAC analysis, highly branched agalactosylated N\u2010glycans were not recognized by the DC\u2010SIGN\u2010related lectins, presumably for reasons of steric hindrance. Indeed, there is no structural space to accommodate the terminal \u03b21\u20104GlcNAc residue on the \u03b11\u20103Man branch according to their reported crystal and modeling structures. The DC\u2010SIGN\u2010related lectins are unlikely to accommodate O\u2010glycans because of steric hindrance caused by the presence of an attached polypeptide.",

The characteristic features are (a) DC\u2010SIGN apparently shows higher affinity to high\u2010mannose\u2010type N\u2010glycans than to DC\u2010SIGNR, (b) the binding affinities of both DC\u2010SIGN and DC\u2010SIGNR are enhanced when the number of \u03b1Man structures increases, consistent with previous results [4] and (c) DC\u2010SIGNR shows higher affinity to mannosylated glycans (913\u2010915) than to high\u2010mannose\u2010type N\u2010glycans (005\u2010014), whereas DC\u2010SIGN shows the opposite. A significant difference was also observed in the binding affinities of the ligands for Fuc\u2010containing glycans. An earlier report by Appelmelk et al. [40] indicated that DC\u2010SIGN showed strong recognition of a series of Lewis antigen\u2010immobilized polyacrylamides (i.e. Lewisa/b/x/y) when analyzed using an ELISA. Subsequently, Guo et al. [4] demonstrated different aspects of specificities between DC\u2010SIGN and DC\u2010SIGNR CRDs using glycan microarray analyses, and further discussed their binding mechanisms based on crystallographic analyses with lacto\u2010N\u2010fucopentaose III. They found that the Lewis antigens were high\u2010affinity ligands for DC\u2010SIGN, but not for DC\u2010SIGNR. In fact, DC\u2010SIGN Val351 is involved in tight van der Waals contact with 2\u2010OH of Fuc on Lewisx antigen in addition to recognition of 3\u2010 and 4\u2010OH in a Ca2+\u2010dependent binding manner (PDB code, 1sl5), whereas DC\u2010SIGNR Ser363 excludes the contact with 2\u2010OH of Fuc (1sl6) [4]. van Liempt et al.

One the well\u2010characterized example of this is leukocyte\u2013endothelial cell adhesion mediated by selectins. Like selectins, DC\u2010SIGN and DC\u2010SIGNR may also function as adhesion receptors for endogenous cells, such as T cells [2], endothelial cells [42] and neutrophils [8]. Herein, we provided evidence that DC\u2010SIGN, DC\u2010SIGNR and LSECtin serve as cellular adhesion receptors for mammalian agalactosylated CHO cells (Lec8 cells). This finding suggests that these DC\u2010SIGN\u2010related lectins can mediate cellular adhesion events through recognition of agalactosylated N\u2010glycoproteins expressed on endogenous cells. Considering the fact that agalactosylated glycoproteins are abundant in mouse brain [43], and vessel\u2010associated DC\u2010SIGN+ cells are present in human brain tissue [44], interaction of DC\u2010SIGN with agalactosylated cells might be involved in cell\u2013cell adhesion events in the brain.",

            "text": "The cell wall of Gram\u2010negative bacteria contains lipopolysaccharide (LPS) consisting of three domains: lipid A, core saccharide and O\u2010antigen. Recently, Steeghs et al. [18] reported that DC\u2010SIGN expressed on DCs mediates cell adhesion and internalization of Neisseria meningitidis through the recognition of GlcNAc, a repeating unit in the core saccharide region of LPS. Similarly, Zhang et al. [46] showed that DC\u2010SIGN on HeLa cells binds to several Gram\u2010negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus ducreyi) through GlcNAc in the core region of LPS. By contrast, LSECtin has been reported to bind to Ebola virus glycoprotein and SARS virus spike protein in a Ca2+\u2010dependent manner [28, 29]. Subsequently, Powlesland et al. [30] suggested the presence of bi\u2010antennary agalactosylated N\u2010glycans, as well as high\u2010mannose\u2010type N\u2010glycans, on Ebola virus glycoprotein by MS analysis. Similar, but detailed, data have also been obtained for SARS virus spike protein [47]. These findings support the fact that LSECtin binds to these viral glycoproteins in a \u03b21\u20102GlcNAc\u2010binding manner. Consistently, both DC\u2010SIGN and DC\u2010SIGNR would act as pathogen\u2010recognition receptors for Man/GlcNAc\u2010containing glycans presented in Ebola and SARS viruses [10, 48, 49], illustrating that the three lectins are also involved in interacting with such viruses. In this regard, an EPN motif may function as a bridging player towards nonself (pathogen) and undesired self. Further investigations of natural agalactosylated glycan ligands for these DC\u2010SIGN\u2010related lectins remain to be made for understanding their physiological functions.",
