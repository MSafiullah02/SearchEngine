Elderly patients with lymphoproliferative disorders, including chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and lymphomas, often present with lymphadenopathy and a lymphocytosis. Morphology and immunophenotyping of the cells combined with histological examination of a bone marrow trephine biopsy are used to classify these disorders and to give an indication of management and prognosis. It is occasionally difficult to differentiate between a reactive and a neoplastic lymphocytosis.

A diagnosis of iron deficiency requires a search for the cause. This should include specific questions relating to blood loss and dietary insufficiency and may require stool examination for parasites and occult blood, endoscopic examination of the gastrointestinal tract to exclude occult malignancy, and serological or other tests for coeliac disease.

A normal platelet count with a prolonged bleeding time is characteristic of a disorder of platelet function, but some patients with abnormal platelet function are also thrombocytopenic. Hereditary disorders of platelet function are uncommon and usually present as a bleeding diathesis. When a qualitative disorder of platelets is suspected, platelets should be examined to assess size and to detect the cytological features of the grey platelet syndrome. They can broadly be divided into two categories: abnormalities of the platelet membrane (e.g., Bernard\u2013Soulier syndrome, Glanzmann's thrombasthenia) and of platelet secretory function (e.g., storage pool diseases). In comparison, acquired disorders of platelet function are common. Haematological conditions associated with platelet dysfunction include myeloproliferative and myelodysplastic disorders and dysproteinaemias. Many widely prescribed drugs can interfere with platelet function, including aspirin and non-steroidal antiinflammatory agents, whereas systemic conditions, particularly chronic renal failure and cardiopulmonary bypass, are associated with a bleeding tendency as a result of qualitative platelet defects. Most of these acquired functional defects are not associated with any abnormality in platelet appearance but in the myelodysplastic and, to a lesser extent, in the myeloproliferative disorders there may be hypogranular and giant platelets.",
