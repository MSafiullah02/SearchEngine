RV clades A, B, and C were detected in the primer set utilized [29]. ADV testing was not done from August to October 2009 due to limited availability of reagents [28]. PCR data were semiquantitative and specimens with a cycle threshold (Ct) value <37 were considered positive. To detect pneumococcal infection, both blood culture for Streptococcus pneumoniae and whole blood lytA PCR were performed on blood specimens, although blood cultures were not systematically performed on all patients [30]. HIV testing was performed on a whole blood specimen or dried blood spot using an HIV PCR assay for children <18 months of age and HIV enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for children \u226518 months of age.

In addition, we compared ADV-RSV and influenza-RSV coinfections to ADV and influenza monoinfection, as coinfection with these pathogens among RSV-positive children was found to be associated with increased risk of life-threatening disease. This analysis was implemented to assess whether ADV and influenza monoinfection were the driver of severe disease. Results were expressed as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Multivariate logistic regression was performed by use of the manual forward stepwise procedure including variables with a P value < .2 in univariate analyses. The analysis was adjusted for age using the subgroups <6 months and \u22656 months. The primary analysis was conducted on the HIV-uninfected population; subsequently, a separate analysis was performed for the HIV-infected population due to significantly elevated mortality rate and altered immune status of this subgroup.",

After adjusting for confounders, RSV-ADV coinfection had a 3.4 increased odds of life-threatening disease compared with RSV monoinfection (95% CI, 1.6\u20137.2; P = .001; Table 3). RSV-ADV coinfection was not associated with the secondary outcome (aOR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.77\u20131.3; P = .77, Table 4). When we compared RSV-ADV coinfection to ADV monoinfection, we found no relation to life-threatening disease (aOR, 0.78; 95% CI, .37\u20131.6; P = .51) and decreased life-threatening disease and extended length of stay (aOR, 0.51; 95% CI, .38\u2013.70; P < .001). The median ADV Ct value was significantly lower in ADV monoinfection (29.7; IQR, 20.8\u201334.3) compared with RSV-ADV infection (33.2; IQR, 30.1\u201335.5) (P < .001). Finally, RSV-influenza showed increased odds for our secondary outcome including prolonged length of stay (aOR, 2.1; 95% CI 1.0\u20134.5; P = .05) Table 4. We identified an increased odds of our secondary outcome for RSV-influenza when compared to influenza alone (aOR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.0\u20134.4; P = .04). No other viral coinfections showed increased odds of severe disease compared with RSV monoinfection.",

We did, however, identify an association between RSV-ADV coinfection and life-threatening disease, which may be indicative of synergistic pathogenesis leading to respiratory failure or that severe disease in these children was largely driven by coinfection with ADV. The association of RSV-ADV coinfection with severe disease was, however, not evident when we assessed prolonged hospitalization. Our data are supported by findings of another study in which RSV-ADV coinfection showed statistically significant increases in hospital length of stay, days with supplemental oxygen use, ICU admission, and mechanical ventilation compared with RSV monoinfection in children hospitalized for LRTI, although no comparison was made with ADV monoinfection [33]. In a study of mixed RSV-ADV infection, RSV-ADV coinfection was not found to be more severe than ADV alone when examining duration of fever, oxygen requirement, and length of hospital stay [34]. Another study of 9 RSV-confirmed infants found that 75% of children with RSV-ADV coinfection died despite mechanical ventilation [35]. Even though ADV alone may be responsible for more severe disease, clinical features such as hospital stay were not found to differ between RSV and ADV hospitalized LRTI [36]. However, increased pathogenicity may be explained by distinctly different immunological responses produced by RSV and ADV. ADV induces interferon-\u03b3 production activating the classical antiviral defense mechanism and heightened mononuclear cell activation compared with RSV, possibly leading to more severe disease with coinfection [37].",

Some respiratory viruses are frequently detected in asymptomatic children and infants. RSV, HMPV, influenza, and ADV are significantly more prevalent in symptomatic children, whereas RV is commonly found in asymptomatic individuals [48]. Another study of infants up to 12 months of age found that detection of RSV, RV, influenza, ADV, and HMPV are highly associated with symptoms, with an OR >4 for presence of symptoms, whereas for EV, detection is not significantly associated with symptoms [49]. In South Africa, ADV was only moderately associated with severe disease as it was commonly identified in controls; the attributable fraction of ADV detection was 10.1% [50]. Viral detection may also be an artefact of prolonged viral shedding: ADV, for example, is known to exhibit longer low-level shedding [51]. In the RSV-ADV coinfection population, we found more frequent low-level virus than in the population with ADV monoinfection, which may be indicative of prolonged viral shedding and acute infection, respectively (Figure 1). The multiplex PCR used was limited in its ability to discriminate between RV and EV due to cross-reactivity; therefore, these coinfections are not optimally characterized within this population. Furthermore, the definition of any viral coinfection is limited by the respiratory viruses we did not test for, although the clinical significance of many of those (eg, human coronavirus and human bocavirus) as LRTI etiological agents also remain to be fully elucidated. Another limitation was that we only had semiquantitative data for viral load.",

Molecular diagnostics for respiratory viruses may serve as an important diagnostic tool in pediatric LRTI, but the possible synergy of multiple viruses in the respiratory tract is an area with no clear consensus. In our study, we found that RSV and any respiratory viral coinfection was not associated with more severe disease. The association between RSV-ADV coinfection and life-threatening disease in hospitalized children <5 years of age warrants further exploration and may be explained by enhanced ADV disease alone.",
