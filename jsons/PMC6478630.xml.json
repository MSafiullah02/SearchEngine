            "text": "Members of the Culex pipiens complex are critical for the epidemiology of certain viruses that menace public and veterinary health (Brugman et al. 2018). At least, Sindbis and Sindbis-like viruses (Togaviridae), Lednice virus (Bunyaviridae) and Usutu and West Nile virus (Flaviviridae) are primarily transmitted by Culex species in Europe (Becker et al. 2012; Roiz et al. 2012; Fros et al. 2015). Furthermore, persistence of the West Nile virus lineage 2 throughout the winter season in Europe, facilitated by vertical transmission, is strongly linked to this species complex (Rudolf et al. 2017). Heed must be paid to the fact that different host preferences of the two Cx. pipiens forms and the hybrids entail distinct vector competences (Lundstr\u00f6m et al. 1990; Vogels et al. 2016). In addition, the two forms exhibit ecological differentiation: Culex pipiens f. pipiens is basically ornithophilic (bird-biting), anautogenous (the female requires a blood meal for egg development) and eurygamous (mates while swarming in a large breeding area), whereas Cx. pipiens f. molestus is mammalophilic (preferring mammals), autogenous (can lay a first batch of eggs without a blood meal) and stenogamous (mates in restricted space without nuptial flight). Immature stages of both forms are found at epigean sites, whereas in hypogean sites only f. molestus has been recorded so far (Byrne and Nichols 1999). Furthermore, the two biotypes are known to hybridise in areas where they coexist (Zittra et al. 2016), which may result in populations that act as bridge vectors due to their feeding preferences (Hamer et al. 2008; \u010cern\u00fd et al. 2011). Previous studies, not only with reference to Austria, mainly focused on epigean urban and wetland habitats, completely neglecting less accessible sites such as natural caves (Lebl et al. 2014; Zittra et al. 2016).",

Only a restricted number of these has been reported from both natural and man-made underground cavities in Austria, namely Cx. pipiens s.l. (recorded in several federal states: Salzburg, Upper Austria, Lower Austria, Vienna, Burgenland, Styria and Carinthia), Cx. hortensis and Ochlerotatus geniculatus (Carinthia), Culiseta annulata (Lower Austria and Burgenland) (Strouhal and Vornatscher 1975) and Uranotaenia unguiculata (Lower Austria) (Rudolf et al. 2015). The Cx. pipiens complex, usually referred to as the common house mosquito, consists of several taxa (Bahnck and Fonseca 2006; Farajollahi et al. 2011). In Austria, only one species of this complex has been confirmed so far: Cx. pipiens L., with the biotypes Cx. pipiens f. pipiens, Cx. pipiens f. molestus and hybrids of the two (Zittra et al. 2016). A number of Culex species are genetically separated from the Cx. pipiens complex (Farajollahi et al. 2011), yet morphologically hardly distinguishable in the female sex. In Austria, this pertains to Cx. torrentium (Zittra et al. 2016).",

Each locality was sampled one to three times, only cave Schelmenloch was sampled monthly from January 2017 to May 2018. The effort always equated to one person-hour. We used an aspirator for collecting mosquitoes resting on the cave walls. A moistened duster proved efficient for the catch of flying mosquitoes. Small caves were completely screened for mosquitoes, bigger caves from the entrance to well beyond the innermost mosquito sampling spot (in the aphotic zone, if present). The specimens were transported in cooled plastic tubes to the lab, subsequently deep-frozen and kept in the freezer until examination. Mosquitoes were identified morphologically to species or species complex level using the identification key after Becker et al. (2010). Mosquitoes classified as belonging to the Cx. pipiens complex or Cx. torrentium were identified subsequently to species level or form level by means of molecular tools.",

PCR products were separated using gel electrophoresis targeting 634 bp (Cx. pipiens forms) and 512 bp (Cx. torrentium) DNA fragments. Mosquitoes, determined as members of Cx. pipiens complex, were subsequently identified to biotype level in a second step (Bahnck and Fonseca 2006) using primers CQ11F2, pip CQ11R and mol CQ11R in standard PCR protocols. PCR products were visualised using gel electrophoresis targeting 185 bp (Cx. pipiens f. pipiens) and 241 bp (Cx. pipiens f. molestus) DNA fragments (Bahnck and Fonseca 2006). Fragments (ca. 700 bp) of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) of the negative samples were partially amplified using primers H15CuliCOIFw and H15CuliCOIRv (Zittra et al. 2016) in standard protocols, to test for members of similar Culex species that had possibly passed unnoticed through the initial morphology-based sorting. PCR products were subsequently purified and directly sequenced by a commercial company (LGC Genomics, Germany).",

Our results suggest, however, that subterranean habitats do not host significant numbers of the biotype molestus. It seems that the two forms are equally inclined to spend winter dormancy in caves. Further investigations in extended caves with a zone of perfect darkness, the aphotic zone and steady climate should put this statement to the proof.

            "text": "Three mosquito species rated as rare, viz. Cx. torrentium, Cx. hortensis and Cx. territans, were collected during this study. Individual numbers of the latter two species are too low to detect any correlation with overground abundance. The three species are generally hard to come by. A common problem in mosquito ecology is under-estimation of certain species when carbon dioxide traps are used (Beck et al. 2003; Zittra et al. 2017a). It seems that mainly non-mammalophilic species are underrepresented in surveillance studies due to the low attractiveness of these standard traps (Zittra et al. 2017a). The high numbers of Cx. torrentium in the caves are therefore quite unusual as this species is typically collected in much lower proportions (Zittra et al. 2016). We assume that these relative high abundances in caves might be due to a species-specific preference for resting and hibernating in subterranean shelters. Indeed, several species of the genera Culex, Culiseta, Anopheles and Uranotaenia are known to use caves as places for hibernation or as resting sites (Tr\u00e1jer et al. 2018). On the other hand, we collected low numbers of Cx. territans and Cx. hortensis, both likely non-mammalophilic, that are also described as using dark and cool places as daytime resting sites. Generally, little is known about these taxa as they are rarely collected (Zittra and Waringer 2015; Zittra et al. 2016, 2017b). Sophisticated trapping devices might be necessary to capture and investigate such rarely collected, yet not necessarily rare species (Camp et al. 2018). The species-rich genera Aedes and Ochlerotatus mainly hibernate in their immature stages (Becker et al. 2010) and were therefore, as expected, not recorded in this study. The absence of Uranotaenia species at the studied sites possibly relates to their limited distribution in Burgenland, near Lake Neusiedl (Lebl et al. 2014; Camp et al. 2018), while there are only single records in other federal states (Lebl et al. 2015; Zittra et al. 2017).",

In Austria, 33 out of 16,000 surveyed caves run as show caves (Oedl and Sp\u00f6tl 2016), but many more subterranean sites are well-frequented local attractions without regular guiding service. In Central European caves, the hazard of a mosquito-borne infection is small, as culicids are using caves mainly for resting or hibernation. Reports on mosquito attacks in caves are rare. This is in contrast to subways and similar subterranean habitats in cities (Byrne and Nichols 1999) where the environment does not fully comply with cave conditions.",

Subterranean shelters house a more diverse mosquito assemblage than previously inferred from literature data. We found that the composition of underground assemblages of the Culex pipiens complex reflects the composition in overground habitats, without proportional increase of Cx. pipiens f. molestus in the caves. The high proportions of Cx. torrentium are surprising but can be related to the ecology of the species. Further rare species in our material additionally suggest the inclusion of caves in mosquito surveillance programs.",
