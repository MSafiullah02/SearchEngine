The infection, named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), is now spreading worldwide. As of April 16, 2020, the virus had affected more than 2,000,000 individuals and resulted in over 125,000 deaths worldwide. Mortality can be as high as 15% in elderly patients, and/or in patients with comorbidities [1, 2]. Based on the current available data, the incubation period (time from exposure to symptom development) is estimated as between 2 and 14 days [3]. At present, there are no approved treatment options in Europe and no available vaccine. Avoiding exposure by adhering to recommended hygiene procedures, isolation of infected persons and social distancing are the only prevention strategies recommended by the WHO [4].",

In addition, data from China suggest that patients with cancer have a significantly higher incidence of severe events (including intensive care unit admission, need of assisted ventilation, death) after contracting the virus (39% versus 8% in patients without cancer) [5]. Another study reported that cancer patients appear to be twice as likely to contract infection with SARS-CoV-2 [6]. Importantly, that study suggests that hospital admission and recurrent hospital visits, inherent to cancer patients\u2019 management, are potential risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection [6]. To date, very few data are available on COVID-19 outcomes in patients with hematologic diseases. Only one 47-year-old patient with a lymphoma has been included in a previous report [5], and two articles have reported on the course of COVID-19 infection in a 39-year-old patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia [7] and in a 60-year-old patient with multiple myeloma (MM) [8]. All three patients had a favorable outcome. Nevertheless, these were relatively young, unlike the overall patient population with hematologic neoplasms which is usually aged, comorbid and highly immunosuppressed. These patients are therefore expected to be a particularly vulnerable group for COVID-19. A better characterization of those infected with the virus is important. Here we describe the demographic characteristics, coexisting conditions, imaging findings, and outcomes among patients with hematologic disease and COVID-19 infection.",

This study highlighted the following observations: patients with a hematologic malignancy harbored a higher risk of developing a severe form of COVID-19 with ARDS, requiring mechanical ventilation, compared to those in the general French population without an underlying medical condition [1]. This translated into a very high mortality (estimated as 40% at 1 month) which we can expect to be even higher with a longer follow-up. Furthermore, fewer than half of the patients were receiving active anti-neoplastic treatment before COVID-19, highlighting that vigilance must remain high in every patient given the long-term immunosuppressive effect of prior therapies. Interestingly, for the majority of the patients, a nosocomial origin was suspected, owing to their hospitalized status or to outpatient visits within the 14 previous days.",

            "text": "We observed an overrepresentation of patients with MM in our cohort (although MM is not overrepresented in our department), suggesting that such patients are particularly vulnerable, owning to the immunosuppression associated with the disease and its treatment, in particular steroids. In fact, the detrimental effect of steroids on patient outcome has been established during previous coronavirus outbreaks (SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV) [10, 11], and a similar impact is expected in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 [12]. Finally, we must emphasize that more than half of the patients were over 65 years of age, and 92% had at least one additional comorbidity, factors which have been associated with COVID-19 severity [1, 2], and which have possibly contributed to the seriousness of the infection and high mortality rate observed in our study.",
