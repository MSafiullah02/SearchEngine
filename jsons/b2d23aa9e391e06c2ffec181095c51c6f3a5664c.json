The first known outbreak of SARS occurred in China's Guangdong province in November, 2002 (Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemiology Consortium, 2004 . By August 7 of the following year, SARS had spread to more than 30 countries, affecting 8,096 people and resulting in 774 deaths worldwide (World Health Organization, 2004) . In 2003, Taiwan experienced a series of SARS outbreaks and the Municipal Hoping Hospital (referred to hereafter as HP) in Taipei City suffered the first and the most serious outbreak of SARS-CoV nosocomial infections: 137 probable cases and 26 deaths (Division of Surveillance and Investigation, Center for Disease Control, Taiwan, 2003; Lan et al., 2005b) . According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC) in Taiwan, 364 of the 664 probable Taiwanese SARS cases reported to the World Health Organization were confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and/or neutralizing antibody tests (Center for Disease Control, 2003a) . In this chapter, we will discuss the molecular and clinical epidemiology of SARS infection in Taiwan during 2003.",

A comparative analysis of SARS-CoV isolates has identified two distinct clades belonging to the early and late epidemics, respectively (Lan et al., 2005a) . Conventionally, phylogenetic SARS-CoV analyses require full genome sequences (Lan et al., 2005a) . Because of the limited amount of specimens for fulllength sequencing, some researchers have used the SARS-CoV spike gene for this purpose, but most results have been less than satisfactory (Guan et al., 2003; Guan et al., 2004) . Therefore, we developed a new phylogenetic analytical tool by combining nucleotide sequences from six variable regions, 5.6-kb in total, of a SARS-CoV genome and validated the robustness of the method (Lan et al., 2005b) . Since this new method requires only seven RT-PCR reactions to obtain the nucleotide sequences for phylogenetic tree analysis, it is less time-consuming and more efficient than conventional methods. To facilitate future molecular epidemiological studies of SARS outbreaks in other laboratories, we have made the nucleotide sequences alignment file of 80 SARS-CoV reference strains available on our center's website: http://www.ym.edu.tw/aids/Molepi/.",

Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that the Taiwanese SARS-CoVs were distributed in three clusters: B1, B2, and B3 (Fig. 2) . The third wave, which began in late March, consisted of an infection that occurred on a train (TW-HP1), an intra-familiar transmission (TC1), as well as multiple nosocomial infections (all TW-HPs and TW-GD1, TW-GD-3, and TW-GD4). In cluster B2, all the SARS-CoVs mentioned above clustered with the SARS-CoVs from the Amoy Gardens housing complex in Hong Kong (CUHK-AG01, CUHK-AG02, and CUHK-AG03) (Chim et al., 2003) . Additionally, we identified a fourth wave of SARS infection (cluster B3), which started in late April and ended in mid-June, that contained SARS-CoVs not only from hospitals JC, KC, PH, GD [TW-GD2 and TW-GD5], and YM, but also from sporadic community outbreaks (TW10 and TW11). The fifth wave happened in early December 2003 with a laboratory contamination case-SCVJ. It clustered with a SARS-CoV isolate used in the laboratory HKU-39849 and another isolate from Taiwan CDC-TWC (Lan et al., 2005b) .",

It is worthy to note that there is only one nucleotide difference between SARS-CoV strains TC1 and TWC3. In addition, TWC3 shared an identical sequence with CUHK-AG01 (Chim et al., 2003) , an Amoy Gardens isolate, even though patient TW-HP1 (SARS-CoV strain TC1) never left Taiwan at any time during the epidemic. An epidemiological investigation showed that the Hong Kong visitor and this female patient sat in different cars during their train ride. This is the first documented case with molecular proof of transmission of SARS-CoV infection on a train (Lan et al., 2005b) . If we assume that the CUHK-AG01 represents the first generation virus in the transmission link, then both TC1 and TWC3 were the second generation viruses and TWH was the third generation virus.

Contaminated sewage is believed to be responsible for the first major SARS outbreak in Hong Kong's Amoy Garden housing complex, with over 300 residents affected (Peiris et al., 2003a) . Two months after the final outbreak of the SARS nosocomial infection, we recruited 658 employees from Hoping hospital that suffered the first and most severe SARS infections to help us investigate the epidemiological and genetic factors associated with SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV infections were detected using enzyme immunoassays and confirmed by a combination of Western blot assays, neutralizing antibody tests, and commercial SARS tests. Risk factors were analyzed via questionnaire responses and sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles. Our results indicate that 3% (20/658) of the study participants were seropositive, with one female nurse identified as a subclinical case. Identified SARS-CoV infection risk factors include working in the same building as the hospital's emergency room and infection ward, providing direct care to SARS patients, and carrying a Cw*0801 HLA allele (Fig. 3) . Three SARS-CoV-infected nursing aides and one infected occupational therapist claimed that they had no direct contact with SARS patients; they may have come into contact with patient specimens or contact with infected bedclothes.",

HLA class I gene products present antigenic peptides to T cells, initiating an immune response and the removal of foreign material (Segal and Hill, 2003) . Researchers have demonstrated that specific HLA alleles are associated with susceptibility to and outcomes from such viral infections as HIV-1, HTLV-1, and HCV (Jeffery et al., 2000; Carrington and O'Brien, 2003; Khakoo et al., 2004) . During their study of potential SARS patients and high-risk health care workers (HCWs), Lin et al. (2003) observed an association between HLA-B*4601 and SARS-CoV infections. However, their definition of a SARS patient was based on clinical diagnosis rather than serological evidence, and HCWs may not have been a suitable control group. In contrast, 14.6% of our 80-member control group and 5% of the 20 seropositive participants carried the HLA-B*4601 allele (no statistical significance) (Chen et al., 2006) . In a Hong Kong study that used bone marrow donors as a control, Ng et al. described HLA-B*0703 and HLA-DRB1*0301 as susceptible and resistant alleles for SARS-CoV infection, respectively. However, they did not collect or analyze HLA-Cw allelic frequencies among their participants . In our study, the seropositive group had a lower HLA-DRB1*0301 frequency than the seronegative group, but not at a statistically significant level (p = 0.22) (Chen et al., 2006) .",
