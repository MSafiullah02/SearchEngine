To date, 7 human coronaviruses have been identified, including the 3 epidemic viruses of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV and the newest, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).2 These 3 epidemic viruses have similar sequence identity, sharing more than 50% genome sequences.3 In December of 2019, a series of pneumonia cases of unknown origin began to spread in the central city of Wuhan, China. Now identified as SARS-CoV-2, the virus had gone on to infect more than 300,000 people worldwide by March 2020.4 The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been labelled a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) having led to thousands of deaths and hospitalizations worldwide. While most COVID-19 cases have been identified as mild, more extreme diagnoses have led to respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction.5 As this infectious disease continues to spread, further clinical and epidemiological characteristics must be elucidated to improve our understanding of the true extent of the virus, in order to improve diagnostic and treatment capabilities and reduce its overall impact on morbidity and mortality.",

Hence, the aim of this study was to report the clinical course and liver test parameters in patients with COVID-19 admitted to the only referral hospital in Shenzhen, China. With better knowledge of pathogenesis, more targeted therapies and holistic care models could be developed, which may help to prevent severe liver injury or failure in patients with COVID-19.",

As COVID-19 is a new, emerging infectious disease, guidance or consensus on liver injury classifications are lacking. Thus, we classified the pattern of these abnormalities as hepatocellular, cholestatic, or mixed. Patients who had raised ALT and/or AST more than 3\u00d7 the upper limit unit of normal (ULN) were classified as hepatocyte type; patients who had raised ALP or GGT twice the ULN were classified as cholangiocyte type; and patients who had a combination of both ALT/AST elevated more than 3\u00d7 the ULN and ALP/GGT twice the ULN were classified as mixed type (Abnormality type (1)). To further describe liver test characteristics, we defined ALT and/or AST over 3\u00d7 ULN, ALP, GGT, and/or TBIL over 2\u00d7 ULN as liver injury. Moreover, as the magnitude of the liver test elevations in our patients ranged from mild to moderate, we also defined patterns of liver abnormality according to another criteria. Patients were classified as hepatocyte type when the AST/ALT activity was higher than the ALP/GGT activity, with the liver enzyme activities calculated by multiples of their ULN, respectively, and were classified as cholangiocyte type when the reverse occurred (Abnormality type (2)).",

Patients with mild symptoms (i.e., fever, cough, expectoration, and other upper respiratory tract symptoms), and without abnormalities, or with mild changes on chest radiography, were classified as non-severe types.8 A mild change in chest radiography is defined by multiple small patchy shadows and interstitial changes, mainly in the outer zone of the lung and under the pleura. Severe pneumonia was defined by the presence of any of the following conditions: i) significantly increased respiration rate (RR): RR \u226530 times/minute; ii) hypoxia: oxygen saturation (resting state) \u226493%; iii) blood gas analysis: partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2) /FiO2) \u2264300 mmHg (millimeters of Mercury); or iv) the occurrence of respiratory or other organ failure that requires intensive care unit (ICU) monitoring and treatment, or shock.",

Comparison of categorical variables was done using the \u03c72 test or the Fisher exact test, if the cell counts were small. Multivariable logistic regression was used to explore the association between liver test abnormalities and the severity of disease, and the association between drugs and liver injury, using odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs. As the presence of underlying liver disease may also play a role in the association of liver tests with disease severity, we also conducted sensitivity analyses excluding patients with underlying liver disease, including chronic hepatitis B and alcoholic/non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD was defined by ultrasonographic detection or CT measurements of steatosis, with the exclusion of both secondary causes and of a daily alcohol consumption \u226530 gram in men and \u226520 gram in women.20 HBV infection was defined by the positive test for hepatitis B surface antigen.21 Furthermore, we used inverse probability weighting (IPW) to adjust for potential confounders and to account for possible selection bias induced by the severity of disease at admission when examining the effects of drugs on liver injury. All statistical analyses were performed using STATA/SE version 16.0 software (StataCorp. 2019. Stata Statistical Software: Release 16. College Station, TX: StataCorp LLC).
