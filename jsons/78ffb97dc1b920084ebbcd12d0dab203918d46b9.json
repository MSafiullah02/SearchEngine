Here, based on a novel genomic analysis of 2625 different viruses and 439 corresponding host organisms, we provide evidence of universal evolutionary selection for high dimensional 'silent' patterns of information hidden in the redundancy of viral genetic code. Results: Our model suggests that long substrings of nucleotides in the coding regions of viruses from all classes, often also repeat in the corresponding viral hosts from all domains of life. Selection for these substrings cannot be explained only by such phenomena as codon usage bias, horizontal gene transfer and the encoded proteins. Genes encoding structural proteins responsible for building the core of the viral particles were found to include more host-repeating substrings, and these substrings tend to appear in the middle parts of the viral coding regions. In addition, in human viruses these substrings tend to be enriched with motives related to transcription factors and RNA binding proteins. The host-repeating substrings are possibly related to the evolutionary pressure on the viruses to effectively interact with host's intracellular factors and to efficiently escape from the host's immune system.",

Being under permanent pressure to escape from the defense mechanisms of the cell and at the same time driven by an essential requirement to ensure optimal conditions for efficient and selective replication, viruses are forced to continuously co-evolve with the host by adapting various properties and mechanisms, often uncommon to cellular organisms (Domingo, 2005; Firth and Brierley, 2012; Gale et al., 2000; Gibbs et al., 2005; Holmes and Drummond, 2007; L\u00f3 pez-Lastra et al., 2010) . These mechanisms can involve the recruitment and/or modification of cellular factors, but are also inherent in the nucleotide composition of the viral genomic sequences themselves. In particular, viral genomes, and specifically coding regions, not only determine protein products, but also include additional, overlapping, information encrypted in the combination of synonymous codons. This information does not affect the protein encoding (i.e. phenotypically 'silent'), and is associated with different biophysical and evolutionary aspects related, among others, to the amplification of the genomic coding potential, to the regulation of viral gene expression and to the mediation of intercellular interactions (Brierley, 1995; Cuevas et al., 2012; Firth and Brierley, 2012; Gale et al., 2000) .",

            "text": "Accordingly, it is reasonable to anticipate that the genomic footprints of virus host co-evolution could be seen in the form of common compositional signatures shared both by viral and host genomes. Indeed, examination of such signatures has revealed correspondences between the genomes of viruses from different specific groups and their hosts (Barrai et al., 1990; Cardinale and Duffy, 2011; Greenbaum et al., 2008; Jenkins et al., 2001; Kerr and Boschetti, 2006; Lobo et al., 2009; Mihara et al., 2016; Pride et al., 2006; van Hemert et al., 2007) . For example in Bahir et al. (2009) and Mihara et al. (2016) a significant correlation between GC content of bacteriophages with their prokaryotic hosts was demonstrated (although no significant associations were found for other taxonomic groups). In Greenbaum et al. (2008) , Lobo et al. (2009) and Shackelton et al. (2006) it was shown that CpG pairs are underrepresented in many RNA and most small human DNA viruses, in correspondence to dinucleotide frequencies of their hosts. Further motivated by the possibility that a complete dependence on the translational machinery of a cell might subject the codon usage of viral genes to host selection pressures, various studies have focused on exploring the similarity between the codon usage preferences in viruses and their hosts. These studies revealed numerous examples of viral codon usage either matching or significantly deviating from the codons usage for corresponding organisms from different taxonomic domains (Bahir et al., 2009; Barrai et al., 2008; Carbone, 2008; Cheng et al., 2012; Coleman et al., 2008; Gu et al., 2004; Kunec and Osterrieder, 2016; Lobo et al., 2009; Lucks et al., 2008; Mueller et al., 2006; Sau et al., 2005 Sau et al., , 2007 Su et al., 2009; Zhao et al., 2008) . Nevertheless, almost all of the previous works examined a limited number of specific viral families and were mostly based on comparisons of very basic (low-dimensional) compositional characteristics of genomic sequences such as: GC content, dinucleotides, codons and more generally short oligomers. Although these features may present, to some extent, evidence for possible virus-host co-adaptation, they cannot fully capture longer patterns of information. For example, transcription factors binding sites (TFBS), the binding site of micro-RNAs, RNA binding proteins (RBPs), spliceosome, sequences related to immune system (e.g. CRISPR), etc., can typically be longer than 10 nt and can vary among different viruses, cells and host organisms; therefore they cannot be fully described by simple features spanned by short nucleotide k-mers. Since viral genomes co-evolve with their hosts and adapt the function and expression of their genes to interact with intracellular environments, we expect such longer patterns to appear both in the viral and in the cellular coding regions and play role in controlling the viral fitness.",

Our analysis was based on the largest viral-host dataset analyzed so far that contains most of the available virus-host associations and covers 2625 unique viruses of all classes and 439 different hosts from all kingdoms of life. We have shown that the coding regions of many viruses tend to undergo evolutionary selection for inclusion of repeating substrings that are on average longer or more abundant than expected in random, and cannot be explained by the encoded viral/host proteins or by basic genomic features such as the preferences for synonymous codons/codon pairs or distribution of nucleotide pairs. Nor can they be explained by gene transfer mechanisms or by canonical mechanisms of protein recognition by the immune system alone. Our approach was inspired by universal methods for data compression without any prior knowledge of its statistical characteristics (Ulitsky et al., 2006; Ziv and Lempel, 1977) and is based on the idea that various aspects of viral fitness are encoded in the composition of synonymous codons by possibly long patterns of nucleotides that tend to appear in the coding regions of both viral and host genomes. Our results provide evidence of a complex genomic level evolutionary adaptation of viruses to their hosts and may have important implications in understanding the viral evolution and developing novel antiviral vaccines and therapeutic approaches.",

They are motivated by the assumption that evolution shapes the viral coding sequences to improve their interaction with the intra-cellular environment. Thus, if longer (than expected from compositional biases driven by neutral evolutionary forces) substrings of a coding region tend to appear also in host and/ or other viral coding sequences, it may suggest that these substrings are associated with functional synonymous motives related to various aspects of viral replication and have been selected by evolutions to improve viral fitness, e.g. via adaptation to the cellular gene expression machinery or to the innate immune system. These scores can potentially capture known and unknown (or hidden) high dimensional (longer than a single codon or short k-mers) information encoded in the genomic substrings of nucleotides of an arbitrary length. They can be efficiently and systematically applied to a large scale set of viruses and their related hosts in an unsupervised manner, i.e. without a prior knowledge on the intrinsic genomic structure shaped by these associations, and with no prior knowledge on the substring length. In addition, as was previously demonstrated in (Zafrir and Tuller, 2017; Zur and Tuller, 2015) , such scores are able to capture complex information that does not appear in single codon/codon-pairs distributions and in particular to be used for predicting the expression levels/protein levels of a gene from its sequence.",

Coding regions/viruses for which the sequence-specific/virus-specific AHRS scores were found to be significantly higher than in both randomizations models (P < 0.05) were designated as AHRS-significant, i.e. selected for long hostrepetitive substrings. AHRS-significant coding regions were further analyzed in order to investigate whether the propensity to be selected for long host-repetitive substrings is related to the functional properties of the corresponding proteins. Also in order to check whether certain sectors of a coding sequence tend to be enriched with longer host-repetitive sequences more than others, local analysis of AHRS in 3 different equal parts of each coding sequence was performed. In addition, explicit relations between the global AHRS scores in AHRS-significant viruses and different low-dimensional genomic features (LDF) of their coding sequences, such as: Effective Number of Codons (ENC), Codon Pairs Bias (CPB), Dinucleotide Bias (DNTB), CpG and GC content and the total length of coding sequences were examined.

The results of comparison of these features to the AHRS statistics of the corresponding genomes, demonstrated explicitly that selection for long host-repetitive patterns cannot be explained merely by their relation to more basic genomic features (see Supplementary Sections S1.5 and S2.3 for more details).",

Selection for long host-repetitive patterns of silent functional information in viral coding regions. A summary of the analyzed hosts and viruses that undergo significant enrichment for mutually long sub-sequences. Each vertical bar corresponds to viruses infecting a specific host organism (in bacteria-a specific genus) and is partitioned into class specific segments; every segment corresponds to percentage of viruses belonging to its corresponding class (y-axis) and is assigned a specific color. Further, each segment is composed of two stacked parts: the lower part with full color interior represents the portion (out of all hostspecific viruses) of AHRS-significant viruses (P < 0.05 w.r.t both randomization models); and the upper part with black interior (but with borders of the corresponding color) represents the rest of the viruses (P ! 0.05 w.r.t at least one randomization model). The numbers (e.g. x/y) shown under each bar indicate the number of viruses (e.g. x) that show significant enrichment out the total number of viruses checked (e.g. y); thus, for each class-specific segment, the sum of its two parts (significant and not significant) represent the total portion of viruses of this class within all viruses related to the organism described by the bar, and the sum of all segments is equal to 1. Horizontal bars visualizes the total percentage of AHRS-significant viruses in each host domain. We can see that coding regions in 47, 36, 39, 27, 25 and 90% of viruses from different classes that infect one or several vertebrates, metazoa, plants, fungi, protists and bacteria organisms (correspondingly) undergo an evolutionary pressure to maintain long genomic substrings that also tend to repeat in the coding regions of at least one related host coding regions of at least one related host (Fig. 1) . These substrings are apt to be on average significantly longer (virus-specific AHRS P < 0.05) than expected if only lower-dimensional silent functional information was selected for (i.e. we expect only 5% of viruses to be selected for by chance).

In Figure 2 we show that 13, 28, 18, 15, 21% of the coding sequences belong to surface genes, structural genes, enzymes and genes corresponding to putative and unclassified proteins have significantly high sequence specific AHRS scores (P <0.05 with respect to both randomization models).

On the other hand, among proteins expressed on the viral surface, which participate in recognition of the host receptors and often susceptible to higher mutability, the number of AHRS significant genes is the smallest (13%).

Selection for complex host-repetitive silent functional patterns depends on protein's function. The upper panel (in blue) represents the number of coding sequences within each functional group. The bars in the middle panel (green, yellow and red, respectively) represent the percentage of significant (AHRS P < 0.05 w.r.t both randomization model, green); semisignificant (AHRS P < 0.05 w.r.t only one randomization models, green); non-significant (AHRS P > 0.05 w.r.t. both randomization models). Black lines represent the mean length of significant (solid line) and non-significant (dotted-line) coding sequences in each group. We can see that those structural proteins are encoded by the highest portion of AHRS significant coding sequences. On the other hand, surface proteins have the smallest number of AHRS significant coding sequences. The enzymes and other proteins show an intermediate level of selection for long host-repetitive patterns. Each green bar (at the bottom) is divided into three parts, corresponding to the local AHRS analysis in the 5 0 , middle, and 3 0 segments of a coding sequence. In each part the percentage of AHRS-significant genes with the highest local AHRS found in this part is indicated. We can see that for each gene group, most of the sequences used to have the highest local AHRS in the middle part; the percentage of genes with the highest local AHRS in the 3 0 part was found to be the smallest within most of the bins the structural group contains the highest number of AHRS-significant genes and the surface group and enzymes contain the lowest number. Therefore, our conclusions cannot be attributed only to the lengths of the coding regions (see details in Supplementary Section S2.6). This finding is in agreement with stronger codon usage resemblance of viral structural genes to their host sequences demonstrated in Bahir et al. (2009) , and may be attributed to higher expression levels required from this functional group. Thus, this group should be under stronger selection for optimal gene expression codes; the higher expression levels may also have stronger effect on the host immune system, triggering stronger selection to include longer pattern similar to the host.",

We found that for each gene group, most of the sequences used to have the highest local AHRS in the middle part; the percentage of genes with the highest local AHRS in the 3 0 part was found to be the smallest. This pattern may be related to the fact that initiation and termination (of translation and transcription), encoded in the coding region ends, tend to be non-canonical in viruses (e.g. initiation via IRES), while the regulation at the middle of the coding region is more conserved relatively to the host (Clyde and Harris, 2006; Gale et al., 2000; Groat-Carmona et al., 2012; Jackson, 2005; Kieft, 2008; L\u00f3 pez-Lastra et al., 2010; Thurner et al., 2004) .

Viral genomes include various types of motifs that are recognized by the host gene expression machinery; since the same (host) gene expression machinery processes both the viral and the host genes these motifs tend to appear both in the host and in the virus.

However, it is plausible that they are related to alternative known and/or unknown immune mechanisms. One such relevant mechanism in bacteria is given by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) (Krieg, 2002) . This mechanism is based on creating fragments from the viral genome that are transcribed to short RNA molecules (crRNAs); these short RNA molecules match a certain region in the viral genome and 'guide' a protein complex (CAS-crRNA complex) that cuts the viral genome in this region and inactivates the virus. Since this mechanism is based on the recognition of short genomic sub-sequences that should appear in the virus/phage but not in the host, this may trigger evolution of the nucleotide composition of the virus/phage to be similar to the host. This may result in similar patterns of codons, and longer sequences that appear in the phage and the host, explaining especially high levels of AHRS-significant viruses in the bacteria reported here.",

One explanation for that is related to the fact that these proteins tend to be more highly expressed and thus are under stronger selection for gene expression optimization, as is well known for non-viral genes; see for example (dos Reis and Wernisch, 2009 ). In addition, our analysis shows that up to 15-50% of the variance related to the shared host-virus sub-sequences can be explained by LDFs (e.g. codon bias; see the Results). Among others, this correlation may be related to the fact that viruses that undergo stronger selection for LDFs (e.g. due to larger effective population size or higher selection pressure) also tend to undergo stronger selection for shared long subsequences with the host in their coding region; for example, as explained above, both signals may contribute to improved expression levels.",

Thus, although the host-homologous genes were excluded from our analysis, many of the results reported here may be generalized to the case of HGT. It is important to emphasize that a central HGT mechanism is transduction, the process in which bacterial DNA is moved from one bacterium to another by a bacteriophage (Soucy et al., 2015) . Thus, the reported relations between (i) the host silent patterns and (ii) the transferred gene silent patterns have much overlap: The fact that viral fitness is related to the similarity of its silent patterns to the host should directly improve its ability to transfer genes; it is also directly related to the fact that the silent aspects/codes in the transferred genes are more adapted to the new host since the virus undergoes evolution to be better adapted to the host.",

Second, experimental and computational approaches for engineering viral coding regions for improving and decreasing their fitness based on the optimization of their AVRS/AHRS should be developed. Third, it will be interesting to perform further specific study related to the functionality of some of the virus-host repetitive sequences, or to the ways the host immune system may have been adapted to these silent/signals. This may require the deciphering of novel immune system pathways. Finally, it should be important to consider the possible effect of the non-trivial synonymous patterns reported here when developing models for viral molecular evolution; it may also be interesting and challenging to track the evolution of these patterns in viruses.",
