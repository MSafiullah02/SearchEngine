Furthermore, most of the cases of SARI in China (74.7% or 94.29%) resulted from viral pathogens, according to the latest report [3]. It is important to catalogue viruses present in the respiratory tracts of children as comprehensively as possible. However, it is difficult to detect all viral pathogens and make a definite diagnosis by routine detection methods because of the variety of respiratory viruses and genetic variations.",

Results from investigations of the virome of children's respiratory tracts have been reported by several groups [14], [15], [16], [17]. Metagenomic detection of viral pathogens in nasal and faecal specimens in Japan indicated that the unbiased high-throughput sequencing approach is useful for directly detecting pathogenic viruses [18]; however, genome analysis was seldom available, due to the majority of reads (> 90%) derived from the host genome. Because of the high proportion of host genomic and bacterial sequences, viral reads were rarely detected in respiratory samples by high-throughput sequencing, or only a small proportion (<1%) of generated reads were assigned to known viruses. Most studies of the respiratory tract virome were conducted using routine molecular detection methods [19], [20]. For example, one recent report about viral profiles in China showed that piconaviruses and paramyxoviruses are the most common viral pathogens among children with SARI using a commercial assay for 18 respiratory viral targets based on multiplex PCR [20]. Comprehensive and detailed metagenomic analyses of respiratory tracts of children with SARI and matched control groups have not yet been reported. Therefore, we conducted a viral metagenomic analysis and attempted to provide a complete picture of the viral content and diversity in the respiratory tracts of children with SARI.",

The detailed results are summarized in Fig. 1\n, which shows that the relative abundance of reads of different viruses varied between respiratory sample pools. The most highly represented respiratory viruses were, in order of sequence read abundance, human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) (48.1% of all non-bacteriophage virus reads), human coronaviruses (HCoVs) (24.3%), Torque teno virus (TTVs) (17.4%), human bocavirus (HBoV) (7.3%), human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV) (2.0%), human rhinovirus (HRV) (0.3%), influenza viruses (0.3%) and human adenoviruses (HAdV) (0.1%). These virus species above together comprised almost 99% of the viral contigs or reads in all sample pools (Table 1). However, some sequences matching with other eukaryotic viruses were also detected within the respiratory tract, but at much lower read abundance. These included human metapneumovirus, measles virus, hepatitis viruses B and C, human papillomavirus, human poliovirus 2 and influenza viruses B and C (Table 1). The poliovirus sequences identified were likely to be derived from the oral vaccine (Sabin type 2 vaccine strain) and hepatitis viruses B and C sequences might come from chronic hepatitis B or C carrier children.",

This study is the first to perform a full, detailed analysis of the virome of respiratory tract samples among children with SARI and a cohort group. Several metagenomic analyses of the respiratory virome of children have been conducted. Lysholm et al.\n[15] analysed the viral microbiome in patients with severe lower respiratory tract infections and found three major families: Paramyxoviridae, Picornaviridae and Orthomyxoviridae. Additionally, the predominant genera identified included HRSV, influenza virus A and HRV, whereas influenza A and HRV represented a small proportion of viral reads in the present analysis. Zoll et al.\n[22] reported that HRV, TTV and TTMV were frequently detected in children and that viral populations were less complicated than those found in children from Beijing. The only viral metagenomic research on respiratory samples was reported by Yang et al.\n[17] in China, in which only 0.05% of the sequences were virally derived. These differences may be the result of differences in the respiratory samples of children, sample collection, location and time, because the residual genome of host and bacteria will greatly affect the later metagenomic analysis. The respiratory tracts of children were likely to act as mixing vessels in which diverse viruses could be detected, such as common respiratory viruses, zoonotic pathogens, and some viruses associated with non-respiratory viral infections.",

No association was found between the presence of TTV and SARI; all the observations indicated that children might constitute an important reservoir of TTVs. In addition, some reads matching with zoonotic pathogens were detected in the respiratory tracts of both children with SARI and controls, such as flock house virus, porcine stool-associated circular virus, bovine diarrhoea virus and rodent TTV.

The proportion of bacteriophage among all generated reads per sample pool not only influenced the viral composition, but also revealed the presence of other pathogens in respiratory samples, such as various bacteria.
