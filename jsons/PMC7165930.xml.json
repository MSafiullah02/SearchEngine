Correlation with a variably intense inflammatory reaction is stated in some cases (Otto et al., 1994; Handt et al., 1995; Hermanns et al., 1995; Fox et al., 1996; Happonen et al., 1996; Neiger et al., 1998; Norris et al., 1999; Simpson et al., 2000). Intestinal Helicobacter infections in cats have been studied very little, presumably due to difficulties in identifying these organisms. There are only two reports on intestinal Helicobacter infections with clinical symptoms in cats (Foley et al., 1998, 1999). In dogs, mice and hamsters, however, these organisms are regarded as normal intestinal colonizers (Lockard and Boler, 1970; Gebhart et al., 1989; Schauer et al., 1993; Stanley et al., 1993; Fox et al., 1995).",

After 40 cycles, the amplification products were subjected to gel electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels, and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. The presence of polymerase inhibitory substances was determined by spiking the material with positive controls. Negative controls for DNA extraction and for the PCR reagents were run in parallel.",

The morphology of the gastrointestinal alterations together with the negative immunohistochemical results meant that FeLV\u2010associated enteritis, parvovirus enteritis and coronavirus enteritis could be excluded (Reinacher, 1987; Kipar et al., 1998a, 2000). Electron microscopy did not reveal virus particles in intestinal epithelial cells, rendering other viral infections, such as astrovirus, rotavirus, or torovirus infections, which are generally of minor pathological significance (Harbour, 1998), unlikely. Fungal elements or parasites were not demonstrated, and other bacteria were not observed in significant amounts. Furthermore, it has been shown that the antibody against H. pylori, applied for immunohistochemistry, does not cross\u2010react with Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, and Campylobacter jejuni/coli (Andersen et al., 1988). Unfortunately, a microbiological examination was not performed which would have served to definitely exclude other potential bacterial pathogens. The case history does not indicate drugs (cytostatica) or radiation as potential reasons for the alterations observed. Therefore, it seems likely that the described spiral\u2010shaped organisms are responsible for the lesions found.",

The organisms bear more of a resemblance to \u2018F. rappini\u2019, H. bilis and H. canis, some closely related bacilli isolated from the intestine of various species (Lockard and Boler, 1970; Schauer et al., 1993; Stanley et al., 1993; Fox et al., 1995; Foley et al., 1999). The presence of a single periplasmic filament together with the lack of a basal plate at the point of flagella insertion strongly support that the organism is actually \u2018F. rappini\u2019 (Lockard and Boler, 1970; Stanley et al., 1993; Fox et al., 1995). However, a definite identification of the organism was not possible, as the PCR for bacterial ribosomal RNA genes (16S rDNA) did not yield any amplification product, thereby excluding determination of specific 16S rDNA sequences. It seems likely that the reason for the failure to detect 16S rDNA was DNA degradation due to prolonged formalin fixation and paraffin embedding.",

Species differentiation has most often identified \u2018H. heilmannii\u2019 and H. felis, whereas H. pylori infection has only been occasionally observed in commercial catteries, but not in pet or stray cats (Handt et al., 1994, 1995; El\u2010Zaatari et al., 1997; Neiger et al., 1998). Intestinal Helicobacter infection, however, has only been reported twice in cats (Foley et al., 1998, 1999). Helicobacter colifelis was isolated from the caecum and colon of a cat suffering from severe diarrhoea. The bacilli formed dense layers on the mucosal surface and within crypts which showed dilation and flattened epithelium (Foley et al., 1998). Helicobacter canis was isolated in a cat colony. The bacilli were found to be adhered to the colonic mucosal surface, and mixed cellular infiltrates and occasional crypt abscesses were observed. However, as both healthy cats and cats suffering from diarrhoea harboured the agent, the pathogenic role of H. canis could not be determined (Foley et al., 1999).",

The same is true for H. cinaedi in hamsters (Gebhart et al., 1989) and H. canis in the dog (Stanley et al., 1993). However, H. cinaedi and H. fennelliae have been shown to be potential enteric pathogens in humans (Totten et al., 1985). There is evidence for H. canis to be an enteric pathogen in cats (Foley et al., 1999), and a new Helicobacter species has been isolated from cotton\u2010top tamarins with chronic colitis (Saunders et al., 1999). Taking these observations and the present case into account, there is strong evidence that a group of phylogenetically closely related Helicobacter species are potentially enteropathogenic (Stanley et al., 1993; Fox et al., 1995; Saunders et al., 1999).",
