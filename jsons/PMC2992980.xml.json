Early epidemiologic studies frequently suffered from variable viral isolation rates14 and had to rely on tissue culture and serology for the detection of HRV, RSV, human influenza virus (IF), human parainfluenzavirus (HPIV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), enterovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae,15 pneumococcal strains, and Haemophilus influenzae.16, 17 Microbial pathogens are usually more abundant in nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) from children and adults with active asthma.17, 18, 19 Due to technological limitations and variable clinical criteria for diagnosing asthma,14 observations from some early studies showed only weak correlations between respiratory infections and wheezy bronchitis and asthma.20 Total viral isolation rates of RSV, HRV, and HPIV in children younger than 15 years were as low as 14.2% (38/267 children)18 to as high as 45% (22/72 children)17 during hospital admissions or reported asthma attacks. Despite the limitations, these early studies identified important factors that influence certain virus isolation rates, including patient readmission status and season of illness,18 sensitivity of detection method,14 environmental exposures such as parental smoking,21 and patient age.22 The controversial question of whether viral infections cause asthma exacerbations or if the asthma phenotype enhances susceptibility to infectious disease was still not answered.",

Despite the lack of high-tech tools such as PCR and microarrays, the extensive study found that HRV, HPIV, and RSV were the predominant infectious agents in 614 isolates. RSV infection was highest among children younger than 4 years and occurred most often during winter months, whereas HRV illnesses occurred at all seasons and ages. Recent reports that use PCR and more sensitive methods generally confirm the findings of the Roehampton study.7, 24, 25 The frequent detection of respiratory tract pathogens during acute lower respiratory bronchitis26, 27 suggests microbial pathogens trigger airway inflammation and stimulate leukocyte infiltration. More importantly, certain populations of children wheeze after a viral infection but show no symptoms of wheeze between viral infections, suggesting an immediate correlation between asthmatic phenotype and respiratory infections.28 Although a multitude of factors, such as genetics, environment, weather, and atopic sensitization, could trigger asthma attacks, microbial pathogens have a potential for contributing to both persistent and episodic asthma attacks.",

Collecting NPA samples and using PCR for viral detection, the Perth study identified HRV, RSV, human coronavirus (HCoV), HPIV, and IF as the predominant respiratory pathogens associated with ARIs. In control children, who were healthy and asymptomatic, 24% of the NPA samples were positive for viral agent whereas viruses were present in 69% of the infected children. HRV was the most frequent virus identified with all 3 forms of ARI, including upper respiratory illness (URI), lower respiratory illness without wheeze (nwLRI), and lower respiratory illness with wheeze (wLRI). The attributable risk associated with wLRI, which is a measure of the degree to which a specific pathogen contributes to the severity of the respiratory illness, was highest for HRV and RSV, at 39% and 12%, respectively.29 In a 5-year follow-up of the original Perth birth cohort, HRV- and RSV-associated wheeze with LRI were correlated with statistical significance to current or persistent wheeze, and current asthma later in life.7 Skin prick tests helped categorize the remaining 198 children into the following groups: never atopic, atopic by age of 2 years, or atopic after 2 years. Combining ARI histories and status of atopic sensitization, children who were atopic by age 2 and had acquired wLRI HRV infections were found to have the greatest likelihood of developing wheeze by age 5 years. Odds ratios associated with this group nearly doubled when more than one wLRI was reported. The cohort studies by Merci and colleagues7 provide evidence that HRV-induced wLRI and early sensitization are risk factors for current and persistent wheeze and asthma by the age of 5 years.",

Among 259 children examined in the study known as Childhood Origins of ASThma (COAST) in Madison, Wisconsin, 73 children developed childhood asthma by their sixth year. Wheezing illnesses attributed to either HRV or RSV in their third year of life increased their risk of developing asthma by age 6; in particular, 90% of children who had wheezy HRV-induced illness by age 3 subsequently became asthmatic by age 6 years. HRV-induced wheezing observed within the first, second, and third years of life increased the risk for asthma by the age of 6, and led to the conclusion that rhinovirus-associated illnesses during infancy are early predictors of subsequent development of asthma by age 6 years. In agreement with Merci and colleagues7 and Stein and colleagues,31 respiratory illnesses without wheeze were not statistically correlated with the development of asthma at age 6 years. Several longitudinal studies implicated HRV as a prominent viral pathogen in asthma etiology.",

Tables 1 and 2\nsummarize the study designs, population groups, and types of respiratory tract pathogens isolated in international clinical studies of adults and children from the 1970s to the current time. Four Swedish cohort studies conducted by Sigurs and colleagues27, 32, 33, 34 prospectively followed 46 children from infancy until the age of 18 years. Compared with 92 age-matched control subjects, exposure to RSV was associated with a significantly higher prevalence of asthma (39% in RSV-exposed vs 9% in controls), allergic rhinoconjunctivitis at age 1327 (39% in RSV-exposed vs 15% in controls), and sensitization to allergens by age 1834 (41% in RSV-exposed vs 14% in controls). The occurrence of RSV-induced bronchiolitis within the first year of life was associated with the development of asthma at ages 7 and 13 years. A 2-year prospective study conducted in Finland using PCR detection methods identified RSV, HRV, and other viruses as the major etiologic agents in acute expiratory wheeze in 293 hospitalized children, from 3 months to16 years of age.35 Among the cases of acute expiratory wheezing, 88% involved a single respiratory virus while coinfection with several different viruses comprised 19% of all cases. The study found noticeable age-dependent variations in viral agent prevalence: RSV infects children younger than 11 months more than other age groups, whereas enteroviruses and HRV are most prevalent in children aged 12 months or older.35 Unfortunately, no screening for atypical bacteria was performed to assess the prevalence of C pneumoniae or M pneumoniae.\n",

Differences between the Swedish and Tucson study designs may account for the discrepancy in results at age 13 years. The Tucson questionnaire study enrolled healthy children in the first year of life, whereas the Swedish study investigated primarily infants younger than 6 months, who were hospitalized for RSV-induced bronchiolitis. Consequently, the Swedish study examined incidences of severe RSV-induced respiratory illnesses that resulted in enhanced airway obstruction and limited airway function. Furthermore, the Tucson study used immunofluorescence and viral culturing without PCR, and this may have resulted in missed detection of viral pathogens. For example, children who acquired virus-negative LRI before the age of 3 years were found to have an increased risk of frequent wheeze at age 8 compared with healthy controls31; moreover, LRIs caused by other agents, including rhinovirus, contributed a low proportion (14.4%) of the 472 reported LRIs and were not statistically correlated with frequent wheeze after age 3 years. These findings conflict with studies that identified HRV as the predominant cause of wheezy LRI in children in the age range of 6 to 17 years8, 26, 30, 37 or reports that found relatively low PCR detection of the atypical respiratory bacteria, C pneumoniae and M pneumoniae, in children.15, 38 Despite the design differences, the Sweden, Finland, and Tucson clinical studies all implicate RSV as an important pathogen in the subsequent development of early childhood asthma.",

Recent evidence, however, indicates that HRV is equally as important as a lower respiratory tract pathogen.6, 7 Symptoms of HRV infection often persist in the lower airways of adults49 and the elderly,50 yet evidence supporting the hypothesis that HRV causes chronic infections is limited because early longitudinal studies failed to identify HRV serotypes. Therefore, it is still unclear whether persistent HRV-induced ARIs result from chronic or new infections with different serotypes.51 In support of the argument that HRVs do not cause chronic infections, a follow-up evaluation of the COAST study participants found consecutive, recurrent HRV infections with the same serotype to be uncommon.52 Because a large number of serotypes recirculate in populations, reinfection with the same serotype is unlikely. Similar to other highly diverse viral pathogens, antigenic diversity could serve as a means for evading adaptive immunity.51\n",

In vitro culture assays and animal model systems have been vital resources for studying disease pathogenesis. Unfortunately, primate cells are selectively permissive to a large number of HRV serotypes. Cells from rodents and other mammals lack the primate ICAM-1 receptor for HRV absorption and thus do not support the replication of the 90% of serotypes defined as the major group.58 This problem has hindered studies of major-group HRV in vivo using animal models. Rodent cells are semipermissive to the remaining 10% (minor-group). Consequently, a minor-type rhinovirus-1B strain was used to develop rhinovirus 1B-induced asthma exacerbations in BALB/c mice.88 Because RSV infections are relatively inefficient in adult rodents, high viral loads of RSV (105\u2013107 pfu) are required to produce pathologic changes through intranasal89, 90, 91 or intratracheal87 inoculation. Despite some limitations, the murine models of virus-induced asthma exacerbation have provided a great deal of information regarding HRV and RSV pathogenesis.",

While neither control nor inoculated subjects demonstrated severe illness symptoms or lower respiratory disease with cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing, the 8 subjects given high doses and the 5 subjects given low doses shed virus for 1 to 8 days after inoculation.105 Inoculated individuals exhibited mild systemic illness, with fever, chills, and fatigue, but respiratory symptoms remained localized to the upper respiratory tract. The study specifically measured viral titers and levels of viral proteins F and G, but did not report infiltrating cell profiles; thus, cellularity associated with experimental RSV A2 inoculation in humans was not directly comparable with that in murine or in vitro studies. Nasal and bronchial lavages from earlier clinical studies provide evidence that the infiltrating cell and chemokine profiles of RSV-infected patients are similar to those in HRV-infected murine models and human subjects.93 Neutrophils are abundant in the nasal lavages of RSV-infected adults and infants107 and in response to RSV infection, early cytokines and chemokines, like IL-12, IL-18, MIP-1\u03b1, IL-8, and RANTES, are up-regulated in the upper respiratory tract.87, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112 Lastly, detectable levels of eosinophils and factors associated with eosinophilic airway inflammation, such as eosinophil cationic protein and eotaxin, were observed to be highest among infants with RSV bronchiolitis when compared with control and non-RSV bronchiolitis.113\n",

In addition, HRV and RSV stimulated production of IFN-\u03b3 in the presence of dendritic cells and T cells when eosinophils were absent. Other reports suggest that eosinophilia and secretion of eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) or RANTES are potential predictors of asthma and disease severity121, 122, 123; consequently, virus-induced eosinophilia may play a significant role in asthma exacerbations.",

RSV-mediated TLR4 overexpression was associated with sensitization of epithelial cells, resulting in enhanced IL-6 and IL-8 production after stimulation with bacterial lipopolysaccharide.145 Lastly, both HRV and RSV use ICAM-1 as a receptor for viral attachment, and up-regulation of ICAM-1 could enhance viral infection. HRV has been observed to selectively enhance membrane-bound ICAM-1 while suppressing expression of secreted ICAM-1.62 In recognition of this binding requirement for effective viral infection by either HRV or RSV, therapeutic applications have attempted to target ICAM-1 with blocking monoclonal antibodies.146 Application of the ICAM-1 blocking antibody CFY196 showed promise in HRV infections, and reduced RV infection symptoms and length of disease in human subjects.147, 148, 149 Similarly, blockage of ICAM-1 through a neutralizing monoclonal antibody to ICAM-1 attenuated RSV infection of epithelial cells in vitro.60\n",

In human trials, asthmatic individuals did not have increased risk of HRV infection. Instead, the symptoms of clinical illness extended for longer times and were reported as more severe than in healthy, nonasthmatic cohabiting partners who had acquired HRV infections.6 Whereas healthy controls usually had mild URI for 3 days, asthma patients developed both upper and lower respiratory tract symptoms for up to 5 days. A distortion of Th1/Th2 responses is expected to predispose subjects to more severe allergic reactions.93, 138, 150 HRV infections in vitro stimulate IL-4 up-regulation in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of atopic asthmatics,151 which contrasts with the usually observed decrease in IL-4 in PBMCs of healthy controls. Likewise, after RSV infection, ovalbumin-allergic mice have airway hyperresponsiveness and enhanced Th2 responses, accompanied by an up-regulation of IL-4 and increased eosinophilia in the lungs, on inhalation of ovalbumin.152\n",

Moreover, immunoblots displayed a loss in the homodimer form of IRF3 in RV14-infected cells compared with VSV-infected cells at both 4 hours and 7 hours after infection. Of note, the expression of PRR-like melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) or mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) protein were unchanged in lysates after infection with RV14 at 4 or 7 hours after infection. Together, this evidence suggests that RV14 disrupts nuclear translocation of IRF3 and suppresses IFN-\u03b2 production after infection without disrupting either MDA5 or MAVS.

HRV capsid surface proteins are highly variable among the 100+ serotypes, and passive immunization will likely provide marginal, if any, protection. Because most HRV-induced illnesses in healthy individuals do not lead to hospitalizations, with cold-like symptoms peaking within 2 to 3 days and usually subsiding within a week, therapeutic benefits of any HRV intervention would need to significantly outweigh the risks associated from delivering treatment or immunizing with a vaccine. As with the failed clinical trials of FI-RSV, the associated dangers from vaccine delivery are unpredictable and could result in symptoms that are more serious. Conversely, if respiratory viral agents contribute to the development of asthma, prophylactic use of antivirals has the potential to prevent ARI as well as the chronic illness. Current antiviral drugs target the steps involved in viral propagation to suppress the spread of infection,64, 154 including attachment, replication, protein synthesis, and release of viral progeny, as illustrated in Fig. 2\n. Alternatively, supplementation with IFNs promotes antiviral and immunologic effects, thereby decreasing cell susceptibility; intranasal IFN has demonstrated effective prophylactic potential in enterovirus and HRV studies.154 In an RSV-infected murine model, intranasal administration of the plasmid encoding IFN-\u03b3 decreased the neutrophilia and pulmonary inflammation that is associated with RSV-induced disease.155\n",

As complementary pharmacologic agents or alternatives to passive immunization, small-molecule inhibitors and viral protein antagonists are showing promise in tissue-culture and animal models.75, 162, 163, 164 A few of these alternative, experimental studies are proceeding to clinical application and may be successful. DeVincenzo and colleagues,106 in 2010, were the first group to demonstrate a proof-of-concept application of RNAi (RNA interference) for protection against RSV by delivering siRNA to the respiratory tract in human subjects given experimental RSV infection. RNAi-based therapies have shown promise in vitro and in animal models for various human diseases, predominantly cancer. In rodent models, intranasal delivery of siRNA against the nucleocapsid (N) protein (ALN-RSV01) before or 1 to 2 days after RSV inoculation reduced lung viral titer loads by at least 2 logs.165 Gene silencing of the well-conserved RSV N protein disrupts viral replication through impairment of the RSV RNA polymerase. ALN-RSV01 is the first siRNA delivered to humans via the intranasal route for specifically combating a microbial pathogen.165 In a randomized, phase 2 study conducted by DeVincenzo and colleagues,106 ALN-RSV01 decreased RSV infection in experimentally RSV-inoculated subjects by 38% compared with placebo-treated controls, as diagnosed by 2 culture-based assays. From days 4 to 7 after infection, the mean viral load in pfu/mL decreased approximately 1 log as detected by quantitative RT-PCR. The antiviral effect of ALN-RSV01 was found to be independent of preexisting RSV-neutralizing antibodies or cytokine concentrations. Thus, ALN-RSV01 exhibits potential for therapeutic use in healthy adults. However, low statistical power and insufficient sample numbers hinder the study\u2019s reliability in evaluating the antiviral dose-responsiveness of ALN-RSV01 with respect to viral load and disease symptoms over the entire term of the study. ALN-RSV01 remains an attractive antiviral candidate because few adverse affects were observed in normal adult humans. Further investigations are needed to test the efficacy of RNAi against natural infections, and its applicability to infants and RSV risk groups.",

National health organization guidelines often recommend inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) as the primary treatment for recurrent asthma, followed by short- or long-acting \u03b22-agonists (SABA and LABA) and cysteinyl-leukotriene (Cys-LT) receptor agonists (LTRA).166, 167 ICS act to reduce asthma symptoms, and help improve forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR).168 Although ICS demonstrate potency against other inflammatory diseases and continue to be the preferred drug for managing asthma symptoms, evidence is lacking to support ICS in preventing virus-induced wheezing in corticosteroid-unresponsive subpopulations.168, 169 In a clinical study of United Kingdom children aged between 10 and 30 months hospitalized for wheezy ARI, oral corticosteroid prednisolone administration over 5 consecutive days failed to reduce disease severity or hospitalization length significantly.169 According to a retrospective United States study, steroid insensitivity was frequent in adolescent populations (\u223c14 years of age); up to 24% of patients with severe asthma failed to respond to glucocorticosteroid therapy.170 Inconsistent responsiveness to ICS likely results from genetic variability, atopic family history, and airway fibrosis that accumulates after severe epithelial damage.171 At present there is insufficient information to assess the effects of ICS on virus-induced illnesses.",

            "text": "While controversy over the efficacy of ICS on virus-induced ARI continues, recent clinical studies suggest leukotriene receptor antagonists may alleviate virus-induced bronchiolitis. Two clinical trials of the Cys-LT known as montelukast demonstrated efficacy against RSV-induced asthma exacerbations as compared with placebo. Bisgaard and the Study Group on Montelukast and Respiratory Syncytial Virus172 monitored children from 3 to 36 months old for 28 days to compare the effect of chewable tablets of montelukast on RSV-induced bronchiolitis, compared with placebo. In the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, subjects receiving montelukast reported fewer symptoms, and disease severity was significantly less than in the placebo-receiving control population. Post hoc analysis of a similar, but more extensive study by Bisgaard and colleagues173 revealed a comparable therapeutic effect of montelukast on RSV bronchiolitis. Furthermore, Kim and colleagues174 specifically investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of montelukast in infants for a 12-month period by analyzing eosinophil degranulation, as measured by the secretion of an eosinophil biomarker, eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN). EDN is more stable than other eosinophil biomarkers and is therefore a better representation of eosinophil inflammatory activity than eosinophil counts alone. For that reason, the group used EDN levels for estimating disease severity and recurrent wheeze. Kim and colleagues observed significantly higher levels of EDN in RSV-infected populations than in uninfected controls; furthermore, patients receiving a 3-month course of montelukast had significantly lower levels of EDN than the placebo-treated group. Based on this evidence, montelukast could be used to treat RSV bronchiolitis; however, further investigation is needed to understand the antiviral mechanism and how different subpopulations respond to the drug.",

            "text": "Although infections with other viruses and bacteria may play roles in wheezing, airway inflammation, and hyperactivity, HRV and RSV are the primary etiologic agents associated with acute respiratory illness and asthma exacerbations.8, 26 In 2006, 197 children hospitalized for asthma exacerbations and wheezing episodes were examined in a year-long prospective, cross-sectional study in Buenos Aires.24 The ages ranged from 3 months to 16 years, and PCR was used for detecting virus and bacteria in nasopharyngeal aspirate samples. In agreement with others, Maffey and colleagues24 found virus or bacteria in 78% of the cases (40% RSV, 4.5% HRV, 4.5% M pneumoniae, and 2% C pneumoniae). With increased sensitivity, PCR has enabled detection of pathogens that would otherwise be nondetectable by culture methods. In addition, the methods for recruiting, diagnosing, and examining ARI subjects are becoming standardized, allowing better comparisons with other studies. However, several factors continue to cause variability in community-based studies. Environmental, economic, and social variables will continue to challenge how diagnosticians and health care workers collect data. In some studies, obtaining controls is difficult due to semi-invasive procedures, and comparisons must often be made with asymptomatic individuals.26 Furthermore, the statistical power of these studies is reduced by the relatively small number of eligible and cooperative participants. While most cohort investigations study infants and older children hospitalized for severe ARI symptoms, additional studies on less severe cases should be done to determine how mild RSV infections are associated with wheeze.",

            "text": "Despite the strong evidence for a link between asthma and respiratory infections, the direction of causality between viral infections and asthma is still heatedly debated. Although there is a growing body of evidence supporting a causal relationship for HRV, a similar relationship for RSV is difficult to prove because virtually all children have been infected with RSV by the age of 2 years66, 79; therefore, the development of asthma likely depends on genetic and/or atopic factors.175 Sim\u00f5es and colleagues176 recently reported new evidence that associates RSV infection with the development of recurrent wheeze in nonatopic infants, in a worldwide, multicenter, 24-month investigation. Prophylactic delivery of palivizumab decreased the relative risk of recurrent wheezing in nonatopic infants by 80%. Surprisingly, palivizumab failed to improve wheezing outcomes in infants from families with atopic genetic backgrounds. As one of the first investigations to evaluate the protective effects of palivizumab against recurrent wheeze, the evidence from Sim\u00f5es and colleagues suggests that early-life RSV infection significantly predisposes nonatopic populations to recurrent wheeze. Additional investigations that use prophylaxis, including passive immunization through neutralizing antibodies and other antiviral candidates, are needed to better understand the contribution of viral infections to the development of asthma. Small-interfering RNA, neutralizing antibodies, and RSV fusion inhibitors show promise in vitro and in murine models, but the feasibility of broad-use application remains to be tested.64 As the asthma epidemic persists and wheezing conditions continue to increase the costs of health care, the world awaits the application of more effective prophylactics to prevent microbe-associated respiratory illnesses.",
