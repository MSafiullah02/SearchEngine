            "text": "Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) is a common problem in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with or without primary neurological pathology [1]. Early detection of its presence and determination of the main cause of increased ICP are very important in the prevention of potentially devastating secondary brain injuries [2]. Indications of intracranial pressure monitoring in traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been defined in the 2007 guidelines [3]. Although there are several ways of ICP monitoring, monitoring through an intraventricular catheter is the gold standard nowadays [2]. However, invasive ICP monitoring methods are associated with complications such as ventriculitis, meningitis, intracranial hemorrhage, and neurologic deficits [1, 4\u20136]. In addition to these complications, there are some disadvantages of invasive ICP monitoring; for example, catheter occlusion, need for re-calibration with the change of head position, obtaining inaccurate values in case of cerebrospinal fluid leakage, or need for catheter replacement after 5 days. Furthermore, the neurosurgeon may not always be available for the invasive ICP monitoring process or health facilities may not have adequate qualifications for ICP monitoring. For these reasons, non-invasive ICP monitoring has become an alternative option today. Also, noninvasive methods can be helpful when invasive tools are not indicated (i.e., milder than severe degrees of traumatic brain injury), are contraindicated (patients with hemostatic disorders) or are unavailable (such as in general intensive care).",

Among the alternatives, ultrasonographic measurement of ONSD can be preferred because it is easy to learn especially by emergency and intensive care physicians, it is easy to apply at bedside, it does not cause complications, and the patient is not exposed to radiation. Optic nerve sheath is anatomically continuous with dura mater, and optic nerve, pia mater and subarachnoid space can be distinguished easily with proper technique [7]. Ultrasonographic images should be obtained with appropriate techniques according to new Optic Nerve Sonography Quality Criteria [8]. Recent studies suggest that daily monitoring of ONSD measurement by USG can be useful not only for the determination of increased ICP but also for evaluating the neurological prognosis of the patients [9\u201311].",

Their validity has been tested for cardiac, abdominal, and vascular (IVC, lower extremity venous Doppler, jugular cannulation e.g.) structures. We also think that conducting studies on the comparison of ONSD measurements by PSUD and by standard USG devices (SUD) are important for finding a more practical way of performing ONSD measurement; however, this subject has not been studied in the literature, yet. For this reason, this observational prospective study was carried out to compare PSUD to SUD in the measurement of ONSD and determine the applicability of PSUD in ONSD measurement.",

Then the two clinicians independently performed three measurements from the transverse axis and three measurements from the sagittal axis of one eye using previously recorded videos. We used special software for V-Scan devices to perform the measurements of previously recorded ONSD footage. The ONSD measurement was performed according to the new Optic Nerve Sonography Quality Criteria. [8]. While recording proper images for measurement, we considered the following matters: clear discrimination of optic nerve, internal and external border of the subarachnoid space; capturing close proximity of the hypoechogenic regions which belong to optic nerve fibers and vitreous fluid inside the eye globe and lens-free images. Measurements were made perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis of the nerve 3 mm behind the vitreoretinal conjunction where the optic nerve is the thickest (Fig. 1). Mean transverse ONSD (mtONSD was calculated as the average of three transverse measurements), mean sagittal ONSD (msONSD was calculated as the average of three sagittal measurements) and mean ONSD (mONSD was calculated as the average of mtONSD and msONSD) were calculated from the ONSD measurement values obtained with each device for one eye.",

Eleven (31%) patients died during their follow-up in the ICU.

The measurements performed by each clinician with each device overlapped through high ICC coefficients. Our results suggest that PSUDs are highly reliable in ONSD measurements compared to SUDs. Therefore, PSUDs may be suggested as useful as SUDs in evaluating ONSD in in vivo environment. When we look at the Bland\u2013Altman test graphics of our study, we can see that there are 0.80 mm positive and -1.02 mm negative limits of agreement for transverse axis, there are 0.62 mm positive and \u2212 0.81 mm negative limits of agreement for sagittal axis, and lastly there are 0.51 mm positive and \u2212 0.72 mm negative limits of agreement for both axis in average. Moreover, when all Bland\u2013Altman graphics in Fig. 3 are examined one by one, larger limits of agreement values can be seen. These limits of the agreement are not only affected by the difference in measurement capability between the two devices but also by the intraobserver variability. When we look at the literature for intraobserver variability values of ONSD measurements, we can see that our values for agreement limits are similar to those in the literature. For example, in a study evaluating the reproducibility of SUD in ONSD measurement, the limits of agreement were found as 0.62/\u2212 0.77 mm [14]. In another study, a maximal difference between 0.43 and 1.19 mm was detected between the repeated ONSD measurements of the observers [15]. Finally, Baurlee et al. found that the limits of agreement between the repeated measurements of the observers were 0.85/\u2212 0.65 mm for the right eye and 0.77/\u2212 0.69 mm for the left eye [16]. On the other hand, in our study, we found that there was \u00b1 0.6 mm variance between all measurements of the observers. This finding was in line with those in the literature. Therefore, we think that these agreement limit values between each USG device obtained in our study according to Bland\u2013Altman test statistics can be explained by the intraclass variation between the observers. Also, there was a clinically acceptable difference between the measurements of each device in the transverse and sagittal axis according to the mean difference and 95% confidence interval of mean difference (Table 2).",

            "text": "Although SUDs are valuable non-invasive assessment tools, they are expensive and may not be useful for daily clinical practice in ICUs and emergency departments. Consequently, smaller and more economic USG devices have been developed and their image qualities are getting better every other day. PSUDs allow clinicians to evaluate physical examination findings quickly and they are quite important for physicians especially in emergency services in terms of avoiding disruption of workflow and reducing the waiting time of patients [17]. PSUDs have been shown to be suitable devices compared to SUDs for demonstrating several abdominal pathologies. On the other hand, assessment of solid organ pathologies by these devices is still a problem because of their narrow field of vision and poor penetration property. As a result, in wider and/or deeper areas of interest, the yield and viewing capacity of PSUD is reduced [17]. However, in the context of the assessment of ONSD, penetration requirement is low and the investigation area is quite narrow. It is usually possible to get good quality images of the optic nerve behind the hypoechogenic vitreous in the absence of cataract, mass or the artificial lens inside the eye globe [8]. In relation to this information, PSUDs (VScan) have a similar degree of accuracy and yields consistent results with SUDs in an ultrasound study on a simulation model for ONSD measurement and these results need to be confirmed by further in vivo studies [18]. PSUDs have also been found beneficial for the assessment of other organs and systems. For example, the use of PSUDs (for lung, heart and inferior vena cava USG) in the evaluation of patients who are admitted to emergency services with acute respiratory problems is feasible, reliable, and beneficial for high yield and speed [12]. Similarly, PSUDs are also found to be as efficient as SUDs in the evaluation of thickening and excursion of the diaphragm in ICU patients, but the quality of the image is low in obese and edematous patients [13]. Also, PSUDs are reliable in demonstrating proximal deep venous thrombosis compared to venous duplex USG [19].",

            "text": "Many medical conditions may lead to increased ICP, such as hypercarbia, hypoxemia, hepatic encephalopathy, shock, hypertension, hyperpyrexia, central nervous system infections, which are frequently seen in ICU patients. Also, more importantly and, maybe, more frequently, ventilation strategies commonly used in patients with ARDS are potentially associated with an increased risk of intracranial hypertension. In particular, the use of higher level of positive end-expiratory pressure, recruitment maneuvers and prone positioning can have undesirable effects on ICP. In a recent study, ONSD was tested as a surrogate non-invasive measures of ICP changes during prone position and/or PEEP application in non-brain-injured patients who underwent spine surgery [20]. In this study, mean ONSD increased significantly upon prone positioning and upon a PEEP application of 8 cm H2O [20]. For this reason, if a patient has brain injury and requires mechanical ventilation, particular care is recommended not only for lung protection but also for brain protection [11]. On the other hand, hypercarbia is frequently seen in patients in our intensive care practices. Hypercapnia is widely known to increase the cerebral blood flow, cause cerebral edema and therefore increased ICP [21]. In healthy individuals, hypercarbia (6.5 kPa = 48.7 mmHg) increased the ONSD measurement values from 4.2 to 4.7 mm and it quickly returned to basal values with normocarbia [22]. But in ICU patients, once quite high carbondioxide levels are observed, greater ONSD values can be expected. Also, hypoxemia just as hypercarbia leads to increased cerebral blood flow and increased ICP. However, ONSD measurement values which are correlated with raised ICP have a wide range and are not the same for each study. For example, in a recent meta-analysis, the cut-off values of ONSD increased from 5 to 6.3 mm [5], while changing from 5 to 5.3 mm in another [23]. This wide range of cut-off values is a problem for proper use of USG for this purpose. Cumulative data related with intracranial pressure and ultrasonographic measurement of ONSD have shown that an increase in ONSD above a cut-off value of 5.7\u20136 mm strongly suggests an increased ICP > 20 mmHg [24]. In our study, mean measurements of ONSD with both devices were close to the upper limits of normal values given in the literature [24, 25]. We can think that our measurements are close to the upper limit as a result of many situations described above which lead to increased ICP. But it is clear that we need more patients to clarify this hypothesis.",

In addition, the number of patients ventilated with high pressure and volumes and treated with recruitment maneuvers in the prone position was very low in this study population. Because of these reasons, we could not divide our patients into clinical groups, and thus we could not compare their ONSDs. Additionally, it is not possible to say if the results could have changed with increasing ICP. Clinical information such as the length of stay in the ICU, the percentage of mortality and the underlying disease variability in the patient group included in this study is consistent with the general information of our ICU, where the study was conducted. However, our study showed that PSUDs might be useful to measure ONSD as much as SUDs. In our opinion, this is important in ICU and emergency settings. Recent developments have shown that the use of PSUDs is increasing. Some developed countries are using them in their ambulance services. Cardiologists, internists, and general practitioners prefer them in the examination of the heart instead of physical examination. Finally, they may be more practical and available for resource-limited emergency settings and countries. European Association of Echocardiography recommends them in the completion of physical examination, fast initial screening in an emergency setting, first cardiac evaluation in the ambulance, and determination of complete echocardiography requirement [26].",

For these reasons, consideration of quality criteria and experience of physicians are very important factors for a reliable measurement of ONSD. Finally, in some PSUD devices, there are two choices for performing a measurement. One of them is to do measurements on the device itself and the other is to use their special software. In our study, we used V-Scan Gateway software in order to increase our chances to do more precise measurements. This software can be easily used after it is set up on any computer in ICUs.",
