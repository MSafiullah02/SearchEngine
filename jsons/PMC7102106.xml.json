It is characterized by acute hepatocellular injury or death, leading to rapid loss of hepatocellular function resulting in multisystem involvement and, eventually, failure. In adults, it was initially characterized by signs of severe hepatic dysfunction, including jaundice and coagulopathy, accompanied by development of hepatic encephalopathy within 8 weeks of onset of the signs and symptoms of liver disease [1]. The inability to assess the age-appropriate mental status and the exact duration of illness in children has made it challenging to apply this definition to children [2\u2022\u2022, 3]. Pediatric acute liver failure (PALF) can be defined as:Biochemical evidence of acute liver injury in a child with no known evidence of chronic liver disease along with at least one of the followingINR > 1.5, not corrected with vitamin K supplementation, with encephalopathyINR > 2.0, not corrected with vitamin K supplementation, without encephalopathy.",

In infants, metabolic and infectious etiologies are more common, with herpes simplex virus being the most common infectious etiology [7]. In adolescents, drug-induced liver injury and autoimmune hepatitis are more common. In developing countries, infectious etiologies dominate with hepatitis A viral infection being the most common infection [5]. Acetaminophen overdose accounts for more than 75% of drug-induced ALF [3]. Diagnostic evaluation for the PALF should be tailored according to age of presentation (Table 1). Preference should be given to diagnosis of diseases that have targeted therapies, that are preventable in future, or where transplant would be contraindicated.",

A comprehensive history with emphasis on onset of symptoms, changes in mental status, exposure to infectious contacts, blood transfusions, use of medications, and/or family history of liver disease, infant death, autoimmune conditions, and consanguinity should be obtained. Complete physical examination along with a thorough neurological status evaluation is vital. Laboratory evaluation of acute liver failure includes assessment of liver function and liver injury in addition to assessment of overall functioning of all the vital organs of the body. This would include a comprehensive metabolic panel, liver enzymes, total and fractionated bilirubin, gammaglutamyl transferase, prothrombin time with international normalized ratio, reliable serum ammonia level, and a complete blood count [8, 9]. Etiologic testing for age-appropriate causes of ALF should be tailored according to presentation of illness, history, physical exam, and clinical course to optimize the amount of blood drawn and number of tests ordered [3, 8]. Ultrasound of the abdomen with Doppler should be a part of evaluation for all patients [9]. Further imaging studies like CT, MRI, and/or MRCP should be considered [2\u2022\u2022]. Liver biopsy should be performed early in cases of unclear diagnosis, not only for assessment of etiology but also to help assess patient\u2019s prognosis. Trans-jugular approach should be used for liver biopsy in the setting significant coagulopathy to prevent complications. One should be cautious in interpreting the level of necrosis in liver biopsy specimens as injury may not be uniform throughout the liver [10]. (Table 1).",

Patients with suspected PALF should undergo immediate evaluation.

Pediatric patients demonstrating signs of worsening coagulopathy and/or altered mental statues should be monitored in intensive care unit where frequent neurological, cardiorespiratory, and laboratory monitoring can be performed. Once the initial evaluation has been performed and patient has been stabilized, further patient management should be along the path of monitoring and supporting the patient and organ systems, identifying and treating complications, age-appropriate diagnostic evaluation, and optimizing treatment to maximize health and survival [3] (Table 2).",

            "text": "Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a progressive but potentially reversible neuropsychiatric syndrome that occurs as a complication of liver failure. The clinical features of HE can range from subtle cognitive or motor deficits to irritability to overt cerebral edema leading to coma. Pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy is not completely understood. Hyperammonemia, increased cerebral blood flow, and augmented inflammatory response are pivotal in causing the increased intracranial pressure [12]. Glutamine is broken down into ammonia and glutamate by glutaminase in the enterocytes. This gut-derived ammonia then enters the urea cycle where it is detoxified and excreted by the kidneys. The ammonia that bypasses the urea cycle is then converted to glutamine in astrocytes, skeletal myocytes, and hepatocytes. Astrocytes, the predominant type of cells in the brain, are very sensitive to rapid increase in serum levels of ammonia which, in turn, cause increase in intracellular glutamine concentration, leading to increased osmotic gradient and influx of water into the astrocytes resulting in cerebral edema (CE) and, subsequently, intracranial hypertension (ICH) [2\u2022\u2022, 13]. Plasma concentration of ammonia does not always consistently correlate with the clinical manifestations of HE [14]. Increase in circulatory pro-inflammatory cytokines, especially interleukin IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor, can cause changes to cerebral blood flow and endothelial permeability affecting the development of HE and CE [15]. The incidence of CE and ICH is partially related to the severity of hepatic encephalopathy. About 55% of children developed HE in the PALF study group, 75% of which were grade 1 and 2 encephalopathies [3]. Grade 3 and 4 encephalopathies were observed in about 17 and 7% patients, respectively [3].",

Fever and shivering may lead to increased intracranial pressure and should be treated aggressively. Lactulose and other antibiotics like rifaximin and neomycin are commonly used ammonia-lowering strategies used to treat HE; however, data to support this use in ALF is currently lacking [17]. l-Ornithine l-aspartate (LOLA) and l-ornithine phenyl acetate (LOPA) are currently being studied for use as ammonia-lowering agents by increasing the renal excretion of the same. These have shown promising results in the adult STOP-ALF trial [18]; however, there is no data regarding their use in PALF.

Clinical monitoring can be very difficult in pediatric patients with grades III\u2013IV of HE. Cushing\u2019s triad (irregular breathing, systemic hypertension, and bradycardia), a sign of ICH, is not uniformly present. Intracranial pressure monitoring allows assessment of CPP (difference between ICP and mean arterial pressure) which helps avoid hypoxic brain injury [9]. There have been multiple studies to assess safety and efficacy of invasive intracranial pressure monitoring. There has been no demonstrated improvement in survival with invasive intracranial pressure monitoring [20\u201322]. Invasive intracranial monitoring carries the risk of intracranial hemorrhage which can be fatal in these patients with coagulopathy [23]. The use of invasive ICP monitoring has not been studied in children and its use in PALF remains controversial. [2\u2022\u2022].",

As a result, HTS has now been accepted as standard of care in management of ICH in children with traumatic brain injury [26]. In an RCT from King\u2019s College, the patients who received HTS had decreased ICP from baseline in the first 24 h and incidence of ICP > 25 mmHg was also significantly lower when compared to standard care [27]. HTS has been studied and is currently recommended as a prophylactic agent to prevent ICP in adults at highest risk for cerebral edema [9]. Target serum sodium level should be maintained between 145 and 150 mmol/L [2\u2022\u2022, 27]. HTS has not been studied as an agent to treat acute increase in ICP in ALF patients. HTS is associated with electrolyte abnormalities, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, worsening coagulopathy, deep venous thrombosis, and hemorrhages [25, 28, 29].",

Mannitol use has only been recommended for acute increase in ICP and it should not be used prophylactically [9]. Effect of mannitol is transient and it should not be used if serum osmolality is > 320 mOsm/L, or in the presence of hypovolemia, or renal failure. Volume overload can occur with mannitol and might necessitate dialysis [2\u2022\u2022, 9, 17]. Most of the information on use of mannitol is extrapolated from adult literature, and there are no controlled trials to assess the same in PALF.",

            "text": "Neurological morbidity is a major predictor of outcome for patients with ALF. Early identification of declining neurological status will allow earlier therapeutic interventions and help minimize morbidity and mortality [2\u2022\u2022]. Seizure activity increases cerebral oxygen requirements and in patients with ALF may worsen cerebral edema [30]. Hussain et al. [31\u2022] reported the role of EEG in management of PALF in their single-center retrospective study consisting of 19 children. Clinical seizures occurred in about 11% of patients and subclinical seizures were found in about 5% of patients. There was increased mortality in patients with EEG findings of moderate to severe slowing, epileptiform discharge, and electrographic seizure [31\u2022]. EEG maybe used as a sensitive tool to screen for declining neurological status or subclinical seizures especially for patients with grade III or IV encephalopathy or clinical deterioration [31\u2022, 32]. Head imaging with computerized tomography (CT) scan has been frequently used in patients who progress to stage III/IV HE or in patients with acute change in mental status to rule out different causes like intracranial hemorrhage and infections [33]. In a recent pediatric study, CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were abnormal in 13% of the patients but failed to demonstrate consistent abnormalities indicating the presence of cerebral edema [31\u2022]. Also, there was no association between EEG and CT/MRI findings in these patients [31\u2022]. A small retrospective study in adults demonstrated promising results for the use of transcranial Doppler waveform to assess the state of cerebral perfusion [34]. Prophylactic phenytoin has been used in adults with ALF to suppress subclinical seizures [32] but no overt benefit has been demonstrated in prevention of cerebral edema, in prevention of seizures, or in improvement in survival [30]. There is insufficient pediatric data to support the use of prophylactic antiepileptic agents in management of PALF [2\u2022\u2022].",

Benzodiazepines can have protracted sedative effect and should be avoided [2\u2022\u2022]. Recovery time from propofol is shorter and it may lower ICP by decreasing cerebral blood flow [38]. Propofol can be used in small doses for short periods in children without mitochondrial diseases [2\u2022\u2022]. Concurrent use of opioid analgesics with short half-life, like fentanyl or remifentanil, can help reduce the dose of anesthetics and improve cardiovascular stability [2\u2022\u2022, 17].

This is associated with low systemic vascular resistance and low mean arterial pressures which contribute to decreased peripheral tissue oxygenation and can contribute to multi-organ failure. Most patients with ALF present with depleted intravascular volume due decreased oral intake and transudation of fluid into the extra-vascular spaces. As with any other hemodynamically compromised patient, resuscitation should start with adequate volume replacement with intravenous normal saline in these patients [9]. If the patient continues to be hypotensive after adequate fluid resuscitation, vasoconstrictor medications should be initiated. In adults, norepinephrine has been the preferred agent as it best enhances peripheral organ perfusion while minimizing tachycardia and preserving splanchnic circulation [17]. Despite the lack of pediatric data, norepinephrine is the rational choice of vasoconstrictor in volume-refractory hyperdynamic circulatory failure in PALF to ensure adequate central perfusion pressure (CPP) [2\u2022\u2022]. Vasopressin and its analogs can be used to potentiate the effect of norepinephrine on patients who do not respond to the combination of volume challenge and norepinephrine [9].",

Endotracheal intubation may be required in PALF for acute respiratory failure resulting from abovementioned causes, or for airway protection subsequent to hepatic encephalopathy. About 40% of patients in the prospective PALF study required some type of ventilator support [41]. The strategies for mechanical ventilation in PALF must aim at balancing the risk of ventilator-associated lung injury and neuroprotection in the setting of increased ICP. It is suggested to maintain low tidal volumes and moderately elevated positive end expiratory pressure to maintain normal oxygenation [42]. Hyperventilation can be used in acute management of increased intracranial pressure not controlled with mannitol or other strategies mentioned above to delay impending cerebral herniation, but sustained hyperventilation should be avoided [9]. The standard of care in ventilating patients with increased ICP is maintaining normocapnia and avoiding hypoxemia.",

Impaired adrenal function in septic shock can depress the sensitivity to noradrenaline and this can be improved by administering physiologic doses of hydrocortisone [53]. Low HDL levels and increased levels of circulating endotoxins (i.e., lipopolysaccharides) and pro-inflammatory markers like tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 lead to impaired cortisol synthesis [54]. This leads to adrenal insufficiency in ALF, also known as hepatoadrenal syndrome. The incidence of hepatoadrenal syndrome correlates with severity of ALF [55]. Children with ALF are also at-risk for hepatoadrenal syndrome and vasopressor-dependent children in ALF may benefit from systemic corticosteroid administration [56, 57]. However, more research is required to make any definite recommendations. The consensus is that a trial of systemic steroids should be considered in patients with persistent shock resistant to both fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support [17].",

Unfortunately, due to lack of adequate studies, there are no clear guidelines on nutritional support in ALF. Nutritional regimen in PALF should be tailored to provide adequate calories, glucose, and protein to overcome catabolism while maintaining euglycemia and preventing hyperammonemia. Most of the recommendations regarding formula choice are targeted at chronic liver diseases or liver cirrhosis [59]. Enteral nutrition with high caloric density feeds should be pursued whenever possible to avoid excess free water administration which may exacerbate cerebral edema [17]. Parenteral nutrition is a safe second-line option in patients in whom adequate nutrition cannot be provided with enteral feeding [60]. Branched-chain amino acids provide no additional benefit over standard amino acid solutions [61]. Intravenous lipid solutions are used as a source of calories but it is important to recognize that fat metabolism may be problematic in some disorders such as mitochondrial diseases [62].",

Prolonged PT-INR is due to decrease in pro- and anticoagulant factors and is a marker for decreased synthetic function of the liver [2\u2022\u2022]. Platelets can also be low in these patients. Despite these clinical abnormalities, clinically significant bleeding is only seen in < 5% of patients, and spontaneous intracranial bleeding happens in < 1% of patients [63]. Newer techniques like thromboelastography have been found to be better at assessing the risk of bleeding but are not widely available for regular use [64]. Vitamin K deficiency is present in about 18\u201324% of adults with ALF and administration of IV vitamin K is recommended [65]. Plasma and/or platelet transfusions have their own drawbacks like transfusion-related lung injury and volume overload in addition to masking the elevation of INR which is a prognostic marker in ALF. Replacement of these blood products is only recommended prior to invasive procedures or in the setting of hemorrhage [9]. However, plasma infusion might not be adequate to correct severe coagulopathy and might risk volume overload. Use of recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) has been found to be transiently effective in managing the coagulopathy and facilitates performance of invasive procedures and management of spontaneous hemorrhage without increasing the risk of volume overload [66]. This may be especially important in the setting of renal insufficiency. However, rFVIIa should be used cautiously mainly due to its high cost and reports of serious thromboembolic events associated with its administration [67].",

There have been promising improvements in outcomes over last few decades due to numerous recent advances in intensive care management of PALF. However, the current management of PALF still remains supportive and is either based on adult data and/or experience from local institutions. PALF remains poorly defined and incompletely studied due to its rarity and heterogeneity. Future studies designed by hepatologists and intensivists, and targeted towards improved etiological diagnosis, refined prognostic indicators, and potential for a medical cure, should be prioritized. Intensive supportive care, systematic diagnostic approach, and early transfer to transplant center with timely liver transplantation are the current best approach to improve outcomes in patients with PALF.",
