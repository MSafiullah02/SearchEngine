A continuous infusion of a small dose of fentanyl was administered until ventilator weaning. Routine management for postoperative hypoxemia included: (1) recruitment maneuvers with PEEP of 10\u201315 cm H2O; (2) negative fluid balance maintenance if hemodynamic stability could be achieved; (3) administration of methylprednisolone 40 mg and ulinastatin 300,000 units intravenously twice daily for 3 days; (4) bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) noninvasive ventilation support after extubation, when necessary.\n",

NO gases and equipment were supplied by the Children\u2019s Hospital of Fudan University, as previously described [13]. Briefly, the NO inhalation device was managed by a flow controller (MFC) (Shanghai Noventek, Shanghai, China). The N2-based gas mixture flowed into the breathing circuit. The NO/NO2 electrochemical sensor (NOxBOX Plus\u00ae; Bedfont Scientific, Rochester, England) was placed in the breathing circuit near the intubation cannula. Continuous monitoring was instituted to maintain the iNO concentration at 5\u201310 ppm and NO2 at less than 3 ppm. Methemoglobin (MetHb) levels were measured once daily using the Radical-7 pulse oximeter (Radical-7\u00ae Pulse CO-Oximeter\u00ae, Masimo, USA). Side effects included increasing pleural drainage, new-onset bleeding, and thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 500,000/ul). If oxygenation did not improve within 24 h, if any side effects were noted, or if abnormal methemoglobin and NO2 were observed, iNO therapy was discontinued. When the patient was extubated, iNO was administered via nasal cannula and weaned by decreasing the flow gradually within 24 h.",
