            "text": "It is estimated that 65 % of fatalities in Old World camels (OWC, i.e., Camelus dromedarius and C. bactrianus) and 50 % in New World camelids/South American camelids (NWC/SAC, i.e., the domestic alpaca (Vicugna pacos) and llama (Lama glama)) are caused by infectious diseases (Wernery and Kaaden 2002). In the past, camels were used mainly for transportation beside their role as the main source of milk and meat for pastoralists. Dromedary camel in sub-Saharan Africa was traditionally known to be reared in the arid and semiarid lands. Due to aridity and desertification, they obliged to move to the higher rainfall areas side by side with other domestic livestock and wildlife. This change resulted in exposure of camels to diseases that were uncommon in their natural habitat such as dermatophilosis, tick paralysis, trypanosomosis, and brucellosis. The situation in Niger, Chad, and Sudan is an example where diseases like contagious ecthyma, trypanosomosis, and tick paralysis have become very serious with increased mortality rates due to the migration of camels south of their well-known camel belt. Drought in the Sahel and the Horn of Africa has also brought pastoralists closer to urban centers, and sales of camel milk became their main source of cash income. Due to an increased demand of urban populations of many countries, particularly in North Africa and the Middle East for camel milk, many dairy farms are established in intensive and semi-intensive systems. This development may be responsible for making camels more susceptible to certain disease. Brucellosis, enterotoxemia, and Johne\u2019s disease are examples of these diseases. A similar situation could be envisaged for an increased incidence of enterotoxemia in camels when raised in an intensive husbandry system as in the UAE (Wernery and Kaaden 2002) or Syria (Khalafalla AI 2015, personnel communication). Changes in animal husbandry related to increasing camel contacts with other animal species, such as equids, may cause disease emergence. Examples of newly emerged diseases of camels resulting from sharing premises with equines are glanders (Wernery et al. 2011), melioidosis (Wernery et al. 1997), and Rhodococcus equi infection (Kinne et al. 2011). Another factor that may contribute to the emergence of camel diseases is the migration into new habitat that never was reached before by camels (Faye and Vias 2010).",

            "text": "It has been over 106 years since camelpox was first described in Punjab, India, in 1909 (Wernery and Kaaden 2002), but the zoonotic nature of the CMLV remained a debate. According to Baxby (1972), CMLV is different from the VARV, the causative agent of smallpox, and is incapable of infecting man. Kritz in Somalia (Kritz 1982) described the first report of a case of human camelpox. The case was a 40-year-old camel herder who developed lesions resembling those of smallpox in June 1978. From the 1970s until recently, it has been well accepted that CMLV rarely infects humans (Duraffour et al. 2011). This is probably due to the cross-immunity induced via smallpox vaccination that ended in the late 1970s. It was therefore postulated that human camelpox may become more common as the immunity of the human population wanes (Duraffour et al. 2011). Human population more than three decades after cessation of the smallpox vaccination has lost protection against that deadly virus and all zoonotic infections caused by human and animal OPVs as well. The first conclusive evidence of zoonotic CMLV infection in humans, associated with outbreaks in dromedary camels, has been recently reported in India where three human cases of camelpox have been reported (Bera et al. 2011). They were detected in animal handlers during an outbreak of camelpox, and the lesions were confined to the hands and fingers of camel handlers and passed through all the stages of pox lesions until the formation of scabs. These are the first confirmed cases of zoonotic camelpox as infection was diagnosed by conventional PCR and seroconversion. Additional four cases of camelpox in humans (camel herders) were detected recently in 2015 in Showak area of Eastern Sudan (Khalafalla et al. 2016, Vector borne & Zoonotic Diseases, accepted) (Fig. 20.3).\n",

Furthermore, the demonstration of specific IgG antibodies in camels (Nabeth et al. 2001) indicates that these animals are naturally infected. The disease emerged in Egypt in 1977, in Mauritania in 1998 (Nabeth et al. 2001), and in the Arabian Peninsula in 2000 (Abdo-Salem et al. 2006).

PPRV is a non-segmented negative-strand RNA virus closely related to the rinderpest virus of cattle and buffaloes, the measles virus of humans, the distemper virus of dogs and some wild carnivores, and the morbilliviruses of aquatic mammals. To date, genetic characterization of PPR virus strains has allowed them to be categorized into four groups: three from Africa and one from Asia. This virus has a particular affinity for lymphoid tissues and epithelial tissue of the gastrointestinal (GI) and respiratory tracts, where it produces characteristic lesions.",

The first documented outbreak of PPR in camels reported from Ethiopia in 1996, consisted of a highly contagious respiratory syndrome with elevated morbidity and low mortality rates (Roger et al. 2000, 2001). Consecutive outbreaks of a similar disease occurred in Eastern Sudan in 2004 and later in Somalia and Kenya. Though investigations in Somalia and Kenya were inconclusive and failed to identify the real causative agent, the disease in Sudan was diagnosed as a PPR virus (small ruminant virus) infection (Khalafalla et al. 2010). The incriminated virus belongs to the genus Morbillivirus in the family Paramyxoviridae\u2014a group of RNA viruses characterized by continuous evolution and species jumping. Newly evolved viruses in this family include phocine distemper virus and Hendra virus, formerly called equine Morbillivirus (Earle et al. 2011).",

The presence of more than one form points to involvement of other pathogens as secondary invaders or to the genetic variations of the causative virus. The last hypothesis was verified by detecting lineage III of PPRV from camels in Ethiopia in 1997 and lineage IV from camels affected by PPRV in 2004 in Sudan (Kwiatek et al. 2011). Kwiatek and coworkers (2011) suggested that a virulent lineage IV strain might have been introduced in Africa during the 1990s, resulting in outbreaks in both camels and small ruminants.",

The AHFV causes an extremely severe hemorrhagic fever in humans with a case fatality rate of >30 %. About 20 human cases have been diagnosed with the infection in Saudi Arabia (Charrel et al. 2007).

Occasionally it has occurred on the southern borders of Europe. The BTV is transmitted by midges (Culicoides spp.) and naturally infects domestic and wild ruminants. The disease is considered to be one of the most important infections of domestic livestock. It is quite severe in sheep, less so in cattle. In June 2006, BTV appeared in northern Europe for the first time (Carpenter et al. 2009) and successfully wintered. Subsequently it caused substantial losses in livestock in 2007 and 2008. The virus has never previously occurred so far north anywhere in the world (Mellor et al. 2008). The explanation to this dramatic change in the epidemiology of BT is many, but one is linked to the recent extension in the distribution of its main vector(s) Culicoides imicola and perhaps new Culicoides vector(s) and to the ongoing climatic change (Wilson and Mellor 2009).",
