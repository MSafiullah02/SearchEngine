CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses, as well as an anti-viral antibody response are induced in infected mice, and they are critical to control virus replication and recrudescence. Although an adaptive immune response is induced in infected mice, the anti-MHV CD8 T-cell response is reduced in mice infected with a virulent strain of MHV (named MHV-4 or JHM.SD 4 ) when compared with mice infected with the A59 strain. 5 This might indicate suboptimal DC function during infection with JHM.SD. Because of the critical role DCs play in the host immune response to viral pathogens, viruses have developed strategies to depress the function of these cells.",

One explanation for the apparent contradiction between the in vivo and in vitro results described above is that MHV preferentially infects either mature or immature DCs. For this purpose, we infected unfractionated BM-derived DCs with a recombinant JHM that expresses GFP (rJHM.GFP) and analyzed cells by FACS at 9 hr p.i. In this virus, GFP was inserted by targeted recombination into gene 4 of the virus because this gene is not necessary for growth in tissue culture cells or mice. 8 The majority of infected CD11c + cells exhibited high expression of MHC class I and II antigen (data not shown) and of the costimulatory molecule, CD86 (Figure 1 ), consistent with a mature phenotype. An attenuated strain of JHM, J2.2-V-1, 9 and the A59 strain also preferentially infected mature DCs. However, compared with JHM, A59 infected immature DCs to a greater extent ( Figure 1 ). Further, CD11cprecursor cells present in the DC culture were about 10 times more susceptible to infection with A59 compared with JHM ( Figure 2) .",

However, we could not detect a significant number of infected DCs in infected mice (data not shown). Mature DCs are the major population susceptible to JHM infection. However, the majority of DCs in na\u00efve or infected animals are immature. This preferential infection of mature DCs may explain the low percentage of infected DCs that we observed in infected animals. Some other viruses also preferentially infect mature DCs. For example, mature blood-derived human DCs were infected at a higher level by RSV than were immature cells. 11 Although human CMV preferentially infects immature blood-borne DCs, recent results show that the virus has a tropism for mature Langerhans cells. 12 Although MHV receptor CEACAM1a is expressed on DCs, 6 CEACAM1a in MHV infection of DCs was shown in a previous study, in which the presence of anti-CEACAM1a antibody blocked the process completely. 6 However, JHM may require a second host factor for efficient infection of some cells, as previous studies showed that JHM infected some cell lines less efficiently than A59. 13 Our data also show that A59 more readily infects CD11cprecursor cells and CD86 lo DCs than does JHM. These results suggest that JHM, compared with A59, might be more dependent upon the presence of this putative second factor for infection. This factor might be expressed at low levels on CD86 hi DCs, and even lower level on CD11ccells and CD86 lo DCs.",
