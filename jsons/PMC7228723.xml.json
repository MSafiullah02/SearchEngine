Although the move originally was made to minimize expense with the goal of keeping ABO fees as low as possible, the decision proved to be fortuitous.",

Approximately two thirds of candidates responded to the survey, with nearly 80% preferring a virtual examination. Notably, 90% of respondents indicated a willingness to participate in a pilot project when available. As I write this in early May, progress has been encouraging as regards the logistics, information technology requirements, security concerns, psychometric standards, volunteer engagement, and financial resources that will be required to administer what we are calling the Virtual Oral Examination\u20142020.",

As the name suggests, Quarterly Questions content normally is delivered to the more than 12 000 diplomates who participate in Maintenance of Certification on January 1, April 1, and July 1 (with the last quarter of each year designated as catch-up time, if needed). However, with many ophthalmology practices shuttered, some colleagues desired to devote some of their unanticipated free time to this activity. With the help of dozens of dedicated ABO volunteer subject-matter experts and extra work by the ABO office staff, all content for 2020, including new material related to COVID-19, was put online2 in March and April.",

Therefore, simultaneous with the development of the Virtual Oral Examination\u20142020, the ABO is taking the opportunity to reconsider the goals of the assessment itself. Such an exercise is not new\u2014in fact, minutes from ABO meetings reveal that similar appraisals have been conducted every few years for decades. Because almost half of the 24 member boards of the American Board of Medical Specialties do not conduct an OE, it is legitimate to ask whether it would be appropriate to certify ophthalmologists after the Written Qualifying Examination (WQE) alone. On the other hand, OEs are the norm for surgical boards.",

The WQE evaluates a wide range of medical knowledge\u2014essentially the didactic spectrum that the American Academy of Ophthalmology\u2019s excellent Basic and Clinical Science Course comprises. The OE aims to evaluate how a candidate applies that knowledge in clinical scenarios with which an ophthalmologist recently out of residency should be familiar. In addition, the OE affords an opportunity to assess the candidate\u2019s communication and interpersonal skills and whether the candidate can think on their feet. Low to moderate correlation between the results of the WQE and OE likely reflects the measurement of separate constructs by each examination. Each time the ABO has discussed the question, it has concluded that the OE complements the WQE, has value, and should be retained\u2014even though the operational costs for the OE significantly exceed the fees collected from candidates. It is a good time to consider something new.",

Our volunteers and examiners, who are the lifeblood of the ABO, highly value the personal interactions with candidates and with each other. Thus, maintaining some method of face-to-face examination, even if carried out remotely, makes robotic administration of the process unlikely (which has been suggested as a means to improve standardization). We also wish to provide a pathway that allows certification to be achieved relatively soon after graduation from residency; most newly minted ophthalmologists seem eager to \u201cget on with it,\u201d although the board eligibility window is 7 years, allowing flexibility for those with other commitments. And given that most residents pursue fellowship training, perhaps the Initial Certification\u2014Step 2 eventually could play a role in assessing and acknowledging subspecialty knowledge and expertise.",
