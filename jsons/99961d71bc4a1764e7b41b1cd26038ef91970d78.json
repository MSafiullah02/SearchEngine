The two former diagnoses were predominantly due to bacterial etiologies while viral detection was more frequent in the two latter diagnoses. AFB-positive accounted for 25.6% of acute pneumonia. Of the positive cultures (16.8%), abscess-prone Gram-negative bacteria (39.6%) and Haemophilus influenzae (38.0%) were most frequent, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (17.7%). Of the identified viruses, the three most common viruses included rhinoviruses (49.5%), respiratory syncytial virus (17.7%) and influenza viruses (12.1%) regardless of the diagnostic groups. Wheezing was associated with viral identification (31.9% vs. 13.8%, p < 0.001) independent of age and time-to-admission. Conclusions: High frequency of H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae infections support the need for introduction of the respective vaccines in the national immunization program. Tuberculosis was frequent in patients with acute pneumonia, requiring further investigation. The relationship between respiratory viruses and wheezing merits further studies.",

Patients with known tuberculosis (TB), HIV or active cancer were excluded. Decision whether to hospitalize was left to the clinicians' judgment. Demographic information, basic clinical features, past medical history and use of antibiotics prior to admission were collected on a standardized case report form (CRF). Recorded laboratory and microbiology findings, antibiotic treatment and outcome status upon discharge were also collected. Independent expert pulmonologists unaware of the microbiologic diagnosis retrospectively interpreted each CXR. They subsequently assigned the final diagnosis of the various types of ALRI in this study based on a combination of the CXR interpretation and information from the CRF. Written informed consent was obtained from patients aged 18 years and older and the parents or guardians of children.

Pneumonia was defined by the radiologic images of lobar consolidation, nodules, alveolar or interstitial infiltrates; a necrotizing pneumonia meant presence of cavitations. Preexisting pulmonary lesions may alter or disguise the appearance of a pneumonic infiltrate. Consequently we created a separate diagnostic group, ALRI with lung sequelae which was defined as radiological images of cavitary sequelae, partial collapse or bronchiectasis. The ALRI with the normal parenchyma group consisted of patients presenting with symptoms of acute bronchitis and normal lung radiographs.",

Sputum was only available for culture in 888 (46.6%) patients ranging from 21.9% among cases presenting with pleural effusions alone to 64.0% among pneumonia cases.

Overall, a combination of these tests identified bacterial and viral etiology in 749 (42.9%) patients ranging from 8.8% positive results in patients with pleural effusions alone to 69.8% in patients with necrotizing pneumonia (Table 1) .

Prior to this study, these bacteria tended not to be recognized by local clinicians who empirically treated patients with a penicillin A-based therapy, an antibiotic that is not effective on some naturally resistant strains of Gram-negative bacteria such as B. pseudomallei [22, 23] . In adult patients with non-cavitary pneumonia, common pathogens causing community-acquired pneumonia in West and Far-East Asia include S. pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Legionella pneumoniae [15, 16, [24] [25] [26] . First, atypical pathogens (i.e. C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae) were rarely detected in our hospitalized patients: of a subgroup of sputum specimens from a group of 304 randomly selected study patients, only 3 tested positive by PCR: 2 for M. pneumoniae and 1 for C. pneumoniae (IPC, unpublished data). This result was also observed elsewhere [20, 27, 28] and was consistent with another recent study of community-acquired pneumonia among immunocompromised adults in Cambodia [27] . Secondly, we found a lower frequency of S. pneumoniae compared with other bacteria. Because S. pneumoniae is known to be fragile, some related infections might have gone undetected as cultures were performed at IPC after a certain delay due to transportation of specimens [29] . The extent of undetected S. pneumoniae infection may be suggested by the following sub-study: of a random sample of 24 ALRI cases (median 58 years of age, range 18 -78) for which we also collected urine samples, three (13%, 95% confidence interval 3% -32%) patients tested positive for S. pneumoniae antigen by Binax NOW W rapid immunochromatographic assay (Scarborough, ME). (IPC, unpublished data). Accounting for this underestimation, one might expect S. pneumoniae or H. influenzae -related respiratory infections to reach~60% of the bacterial etiology of acute pneumonia. As a Global Alliance Vaccine Initiative or GAVIeligible country, Cambodia introduced H. influenzae b vaccines in 2010 and will probably do so in the near future for pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.",

These viruses can also cause severe ALRI in certain at-risk groups. In our study, viral pathogens, especially rhinoviruses and RSV were not only limited to these high risk groups but were common in older children. Moreover, age was determined as a major confounding factor when identifying risks associated with viral etiologies. Only time-to-admission was independently associated with the viral identification rate, a finding that suggests that viral infections were under-detected in many bacterial ALRI patients who were admitted late in the course of illness [32] . The extent to which these viruses cause direct and severe ALRI is difficult to assess in our study, particularly in absence of a control group. Indeed, certain viruses were demonstrated to be associated with severe pneumonia [33] ; however, detection of some respiratory viruses, especially rhinoviruses, was frequently found in non-ill or non-respiratory infected control groups when using highly sensitive molecular diagnostic techniques [13, [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] . Interestingly we identified viruses in ALRI patients with little evidence of associated bacterial infection. Further virologic analyses would be worthwhile to determine the factors comparing pneumonia cases with no evidence of bacterial infection to those associated with superinfection.",

Interestingly, wheezing was also independently associated with viral respiratory infection. This relationship between viral infection, asthma (wheezing as its surrogate), and disease severity have been observed more recently. Indeed, recent studies suggest that respiratory infections caused by rhinoviruses or RSV in infancy can lead to the development of asthma at an older age [40, 41] , which could be exacerbated by viral infections [34, 42, 43] . Recognizing the high frequency of wheezing in children with pneumonia (~62%) and its association with hyperleucocytosis in our study, it is possible that asthma could either directly cause a severe case or lead indirectly to signs of severity via superinfection and subsequent pneumonia. Education programs designed to recognize asthmatic symptoms, teach management strategies, and encourage the prevention of asthma should be urgently implemented.",

            "text": "These preceding findings need to be interpreted in light of some major limitations. First, the rate of bacteria identification in this study was low compared to other studies using routine clinical diagnostic techniques [15, 27, 44] . Approximately 17% of bacterial diagnoses were achieved through the use of blood or sputum cultures. This relatively low yield contrasted with a much higher proportion of pneumonia-related patients (~40%) who had an elevated blood neutrophil count, a parameter that is indicative of bacterial infection. Various factors contributed to this low yield, including the probable high intake of antibiotics, which can be bought without a prescription and frequently are administered irrespective of the proper dosage and length in Cambodia [45] . Since there was only a one-time collection of sputum and blood for each patient, a high bacterial yield was not expected. Moreover, sputum tests, which are commonly used to diagnose pneumonia, may lack specificity without evocative clinical information, have poor sensitivity or are frequently contaminated by saliva or upper respiratory tract colonization. This resulted in having to discard numerous sputum specimens prior to culture in our study. The use of invasive procedures such as brochioalveolar lavage or sputum induction was difficult to introduce, particularly in children. Second, the burden of TB in this study was probably largely underestimated as cultures for M. tuberculosis were not performed [46] .",
