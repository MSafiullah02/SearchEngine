The energy interval separating electronic states localized in the corners from states localized on the sides of the shell is shown to be larger for a triangular nanowire with a hexagonal core, than a triangular one. We build the topological phase diagram for both cases and compare them to earlier work on prismatic nanowires with the same core and shell geometry. We suggest that a dual core nanowire is needed to allow for braiding operation of Majorana zero modes at the nanowire end plane.",

MZM are mid-gap excitations at zero energy, that mimic the Majorana fermion and are localized near defects or boundaries in topological superconductors 12, 13 . Topological superconductors can be engineered by combining standard superconductors with semiconductors 14 . Currently one of the most promising platforms for realizing MZM are hybrid superconductor-semiconductor devices [15] [16] [17] . When a metal or semiconductor is paired with a superconductor, the superconductivity can penetrate into the metal, making it superconducting up to a certain depth. This process of proximity-induced superconductivity is one of three necessary ingredients, along with Zeeman splitting and strong spin-orbit coupling, for engineering topological superconductors 11 . The most common model of a system with MZM is a semiconductor nanowire in contact with a metal superconductor 18, 19 , which is a quasi-one-dimensional system. From the superconducting property, the Hamiltonian of a proximitized nanowire obtains an implicit particle-hole symmetry. With the application of an external magnetic field, time-reversal symmetry is broken and the system can support a Z 2 topological invariant corresponding to the topological class D 20,21 . The parameter space of such systems has been thoroughly explored with detailed calculations in order to predict the key conditions for experimental detection 20, 22 . Tubular nanowires of core-shell type provide an experimental platform to include all required aspects for hosting MZM 16 . Prismatic core-shell nanowires from various semiconductors have been fabricated and continue to be an active field of research [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . Recent numerical simulations with contributions from two of the present authors have indicated that several MZM's can be hosted in prismatic core-shell nanowires, where the electrons with low energies tend to localize around the prism edges 30, 31 . This experimentally available system can be a host for previously discussed multichain ladder models [32] [33] [34] .",

We take the cases of a triangular wire with arXiv:2004.14991v1 [cond-mat.mes-hall] 30 Apr 2020 a hexagonal core (Tri-Hex), inspired by recently fabricated structures 23 , and the inverse system, a hexagonal wire with a triangular core (Hex-Tri) which has also been obtained 35 . We show that the separation of energy levels of the Tri-Hex structure is significantly larger than in the case of a triangular core. With the Hex-Tri structure, the number of phase boundaries in the topological phase diagram is reduced, since the triangular core results in the ground states being localized at the three sides, rather than the six corners as is the case for a hexagonal core. The localization of MZMs is shown to correspond to the single particle localization of both configurations. The results suggest that these structures are worthy of further experimental investigation. To finalize, we discuss the possibility braiding MZM at the nanowire end planes.",

Recent calculations based on the k \u00b7 p method indicate that the spin-orbit coupling inside the core can significantly increase due to the effective interface field, in the hexagonal geometry 38 . However, to our knowledge, no such study has been performed for the electrons situated in the shell.

The system can not be adiabatically deformed back to the original trivial state, just as a sphere can not be continuously deformed into a doughnut, therefore the states are considered topologically distinct 50, 51 . By plotting the ratio of the BdG energy and the superconducting gap parameter \u2206 at k = 0, as a function of the magnetic field strength and the chemical potential, a phase diagram is obtained 20, 52 . Since there are three states at the lowest energy, for both the Tri-Hex and Hex-Tri case, the system can host three pairs of edge states and there will be a closing of the BdG spectra for the emergence of each one. We will therefore have three curves on our phase diagrams which are boundaries between phases with different number of pairs of edge states 53, 54 . Topological phase diagrams of prismatic core-shell nanowires with uniform geometry have been recently studied 31 . Here we explore the effect of the core geometry on the phase diagrams. Since a realistic nanowire is not strictly symmetric, from now on we choose to slightly break the cross-sectional symmetry of our nanowires with a weak transverse electric field.",

Hex-Tri nanowire geometry For a hexagonal wire with a triangular core, we can expect to see more signs of wavefunction overlap between the sides of the wire, as the separation of energy levels is much smaller than in the case of the triangular wire, Fig. 4 . As the differences between the side-matched and corner-matched cases is small, the phase diagram for the side-matched structure is presented only. In the topological phase diagram the presence of a threefold phase boundary signifies that the particles form three channels induced by the triangular core geometry, Fig. 7 . The topological phase is entered at a lower value of both the chemical potential and magnetic field strength, compared to the Tri-Hex case, Fig. 6 . As shown in Ref. 30 , orbital Zeeman effects both skew the phase boundaries and lower the magnetic field strength threshold for the topological phase. Furthermore, combined with the spin Zeeman effect, they are responsible for the curious elliptic island, Fig. 7 , around \u00b5 = 61.5 meV and B = 0.6 T. In Fig. 8 , the lowest energy transverse states are shown to oscillate with increasing strength of the external magnetic field due to the orbital Zeeman effect. The oscillations are more pronounced for the Hex-Tri geometry, which is echoed in the corresponding phase diagram. The phase boundaries are three in number but a hexagonal core results in six phase boundaries 30 . The effect of the triangular core geometry is therefore quite significant in this case, mainly in that the number of phase boundaries is halved, compared to a hexagonal core. The possibility of gap closing at non-zero values of the wave vector in the continuous spectrum was also considered. In all of the studied cases, the same phase diagram was obtained, meaning that these topological phases are stable 30 .",

The next problem is then how the MZM's can be moved around in the nanowire end plane. Even though the MZM can be manipulated with an external electric field, that may not provide sufficient control to perform a braiding operation. Lastly, a readout is needed, based on a coupling of the fermion parity to an observable 57 in order to confirm that \u03c3 AB \u03c3 BC = \u03c3 BC \u03c3 AB . 11 . End plane of a hypothetical dual core-shell nanowire. The genus 2 surface provides sufficient motional degrees of freedom for the braiding operations \u03c3AB, \u03c3BC .",

            "text": "By combining hexagonal and triangular geometry in nanowires of core-shell type, both energy levels and topo-logical phases can be influenced. With the polygonal geometry, a well separated group of corner states is obtained. Here we show that the separation of cornerlocalized energy levels is much larger for triangular nanowires with hexagonal cores, compared to those with triangular cores of the same minimal shell thickness, whilst the effect on the topological phase is minimal. On the contrary, for the complimentary configuration of a hexagonal wire with a triangular core, the effect on energy level separation is minimal whilst the effect on the topological phase boundaries is significant. We find for both configurations that the localization of the Majorana zero modes coincides with the single-particle localization. The problem of braiding Majorana zero modes in a nanowire end plane is addressed and a split/dual core structure is proposed as a system with the necessary motional degrees of freedom for a three strand braiding operation.",
