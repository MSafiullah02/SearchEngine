Moreover, they often exhibit modest sensitivity and hence signifi cantly depend on later result confi rmation in central or reference laboratories. The impressive advances observed in recent years in materials sciences and in nanotechnology, as well as in nucleic-acid synthesis and engineering, have led to an outburst of new in-the-bench and prototype tests for nucleic-acid testing towards point-of-care diagnosis of genetic and infectious diseases. Manufacturing, commercial, regulatory, and technical nature issues for fi eld applicability more likely have hindered their wider entrance into veterinary medicine and practice than have fundamental science gaps. This chapter begins by outlining the current situation, requirements, diffi culties, and perspectives of point-of-care tests for diagnosing diseases of veterinary interest. Nucleic-acid testing, particularly for the point of care, is addressed subsequently. A range of valuable signal transduction mechanisms commonly employed in proof-of-concept schemes and techniques born on the analytical chemistry laboratories are also described.

In the veterinary fi eld, it is important to consider fauna species other than cattle and farming animals (mainly large terrestrial livestock animals and fi shes for aquaculture as well), like pets, captive (e.g., zoo, circus, and aquariums), and wild animals.

Animal or human contamination with a veterinaryrelevant pathogen may occur through infected animals (live or dead) and infected animal products (e.g., bush meat, unpasteurized milk) or, to a lesser extent, through direct contact with the pathogen itself. In developing countries and regions, the impact of livestock diseases and outbreaks goes far beyond animal welfare and food safety. Too often, farm animals are also the only way of human and cargo transportation and also of income, as feedstock, as a source of manure and draft power, and as raw material for other industries (e.g., leather, shoes, and clothing) [ 1 ] . The advent of human immunodefi ciency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodefi ciency syndrome (AIDS) and other human immune depressing conditions has been a relatively neglected factor of enhanced susceptibility of humans to animal diseases, especially with respect to pets. Immune-depressed individuals or other vulnerable groups, such as children or the elderly, may even become susceptible to subtypes of zoonotic microorganisms that are usually harmless for healthy humans [ 2 ] . Interaction between domestic and wild animals may also provide an important via for indirect human contamination [ 3 ] . A particularly important group of zoonotic agents is that of enteric pathogens that are transmitted to and between humans and animals through the oral-fecal route, with subsequent dissemination to wastewater effl uents. Outbreaks may occur upon contamination of surface waters and groundwater used for recreational and irrigation purposes and insuffi cient microbial removal of drinking water and/or of treated wastewaters, since many of these enteric pathogens are resilient to classical treatment and disinfection procedures [ 4 ] . They often contaminate water supplies in very small concentrations, hence hindering fi nal disinfection and complicating detection as well [ 5 ] . Screening of enteric zoonotic agents has been proposed for pets cohabiting with immune-susceptible humans [ 6 ] . Very often, the presence of enteric viruses is detected indirectly, through bacterial indicators of fecal contamination, namely, coliforms and enterococci [ 5 ] . On the other hand, emerging \"wild-type\" zoonosis have been transmitted from animals to humans (e.g., SARS and West Nile virus) or after specifi c mutations that facilitate the \"species jump\" (e.g., HIV and H5N1 or H1N1 infl uenza) [ 7 ] . Concerning bioterrorism issues and depending on the nature of the infectious pathogen, the detection of potential zoonotic agents in animals should alert for an intentional release act [ 8 ] . A successful anti-bioterrorism strategy must not only account for the detection of the known pathogen but also of genetically modifi ed forms. However, only a few potential veterinary pathogens fulfi ll the criteria for being considered effective bioterrorist agents. The group is composed by the viral agents of rinderpest, classical swine fever, African swine fever, avian infl uenza, Newcastle disease, Rift Valley fever, and foot-andmouth disease (FMD) [ 1 ] . Among them, FMD and avian infl uenza are especially important for their high prevalence in the world, zoonotic potential, and ramping spread. FMD is generally considered the most contagious viral disease in animals. Occasional occurrences in non-endemic regions are usually diffi cult and expensive to control [ 9 ] . Avian infl uenza is a viral disease with pandemic potential; pigs can act as intermediate hosts of infl uenza viruses between birds and humans. Bidirectional transmission of these viruses between humans and pigs is documented [ 7 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 632, "end": 637, "text": "[ 1 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1109, "end": 1114, "text": "[ 2 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1230, "end": 1235, "text": "[ 3 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1765, "end": 1770, "text": "[ 4 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1912, "end": 1917, "text": "[ 5 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2026, "end": 2031, "text": "[ 6 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2189, "end": 2194, "text": "[ 5 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2428, "end": 2433, "text": "[ 7 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2621, "end": 2626, "text": "[ 8 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 3086, "end": 3091, "text": "[ 1 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 3404, "end": 3409, "text": "[ 9 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 3638, "end": 3643, "text": "[ 7 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Current Situation"}, {"text": "The diagnosis of air-borne diseases is challenging, with implications in disease control, especially in the case of outbreaks, and in individual case management.

However, this may be impracticable in developing countries and regions, where effective routine surveillance fl aws. Thus, a successful containment strategy must include rapid diagnosis through inexpensive and easy-to-use portable devices for in-the-fi eld use [ 10 ] . As an example, it has been proposed that, within 6 h of the reporting of a suspicious FMD case, defi nitive detection should be made upon sample transportation to a national or regional laboratory, or else on the farm itself, and that, within 24 h of reporting, defi nitive identifi cation of the infecting strain/subtype should be accomplished, immediately followed by vaccine production (from stored antigens) and distribution [ 1 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 640, "end": 646, "text": "[ 10 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1078, "end": 1083, "text": "[ 1 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Current Situation"}, {"text": "Following the trend of human medicine, the diagnosis of animal diseases has also undergone progressive decentralization, from central (reference) laboratories to in-the-fi eld bioanalytical instrumentation, very often in resource-depleted regions and settings, even outside laboratory infrastructures. Essentially, this has been done through adaptation of conventional analytical methods and instrumentation to portable and automated devices, able to be handled by laboratory unskilled personnel (viz., veterinarian practitioners and farmers). Several nomenclatures have been given to these tests. They include the names \"fi eld tests\", \"rapid tests\", \"biosensors\", and \"point-of-care (POC) tests\"; this last term will be predominantly used throughout this chapter. Improved diagnostic tests are necessary for asymptomatic diseases, for diseases with misleading symptoms, for diseases requiring different treatments, or for diseases that, by their complex or costly treatment, require previous case confi rmation. By contrast, these tests will likely have little or no impact for diseases which are easily recognized by their clinical symptoms and for which a syndromic treatment/approach is recommended. There is thus no clinical need to identify the causal agent. However, surveillance and control measures must be maintained for these diseases in order to deal with the risk of major epidemics [ 11 ] . It is among livestock animals that", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1397, "end": 1403, "text": "[ 11 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Current Situation"}, {"text": "disease epidemic outbreaks are more likely to occur, and with higher magnitude, given the physical proximity of many animals under intensive husbandry, the probability of pathogens to contaminate neighboring farms, and the relatively poor biosecurity conditions of most farms, but also in the case of subclinical diseases. As time is crucial when managing the early stages of infectious disease, an immediate preliminary positive result obtained by a POC test strongly argues in favor of precautionary and preventive measures in affected farms and surroundings in order to avoid further transmission, until a defi nite and more accurate result can be obtained in a reference laboratory [ 12 ] . Ideally, POC tests should go towards increased sensitivity, not only for early case identifi cation but also for disease surveillance and epidemiological purposes, as infected animals may suffer and constitute infected reservoirs for disease spreading [ 11 ] . During the 2001 FMD outbreak in the United Kingdom, most of the livestock in infected and neighboring farms was targeted for culling during the fi rst 24-48 h, based solely on clinical signs, which may be considerably doubtful, especially in sheep, the main species affected [ 13 ] . The time span between animal infection and the onset of clinical symptoms, and hence infection awareness, can take months, usually through rapid and silent spreading within and between herds, which might need to be destroyed [ 14 ] . However, indoor controlled studies with experimental infection of cattle with FMD virus (FMDV) showed a smaller-than-expected transmission fraction during the overlapping period between the incubation and the infectious period, suggesting that the importance of common preventive measures taken at endangered farms (viz., preemptive culling of cattle, often with severe economic downturn) has been overestimated [ 15 ] . For most viral diseases, since the onset of detectable viremia usually occurs at least 1 day before the onset of infection and/or presentation of clinical signs, efforts should be devoted to the development of new diagnosis methodologies and tools at preclinical stages. Historically, public funds have been used to compensate farmers for massive slaughtering of suspected diseased animals, but it has been argued that this may have generated permissive behaviors and disinterest from livestock industries and owners about transboundary control of cattle diseases [ 1 ] . In theory, POC tests are advantageous over laboratory-based tests if they can be used to detect infected animals before they become infectious, especially if this time window is short, as in the case of FMD. This advantage would apply if the time between collection of samples and receipt of results in the laboratory is, at least, 24 h. In the medium term, POC tests for cattle diseases will likely play an increasing role in the screening and triage of biological samples collected on the farm, as a primary support for decision-making during disease outbreaks [ 16 ] , under a challenging context of permissive biological containment.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 686, "end": 692, "text": "[ 12 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 947, "end": 953, "text": "[ 11 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1231, "end": 1237, "text": "[ 13 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1465, "end": 1471, "text": "[ 14 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1886, "end": 1892, "text": "[ 15 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2459, "end": 2464, "text": "[ 1 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 3030, "end": 3036, "text": "[ 16 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The Need for Point-of-Care Testing"}, {"text": "In veterinary medicine, POC tests have been largely used, for some decades, for the screening of physiological metabolites in blood and urine. Pathogen detection is a newer application, mainly driven by the increasing number of emerging outbreaks, including those with public health importance. Among these is, for instance, the potentially pandemic H5N1 avian infl uenza, as well as infl uenza viruses of putative porcine origin, as the human pandemic strain of 2009 [ 12 ] . POC tests have also been developed for important diseases of aquatic animals, using similar technologies to those used for terrestrial animals [ 17 ] . The most common layouts of commercially available devices rely on antigen detection in biological samples through affi nity binding reactions with immobilized specifi c antibody probes. Nevertheless, despite the requirement for essentially the same performance features, regulatory approval and introduction of these devices into the market are understandably easier in the veterinary than in the clinical practice [ 18 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 468, "end": 474, "text": "[ 12 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 620, "end": 626, "text": "[ 17 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1044, "end": 1050, "text": "[ 18 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The Need for Point-of-Care Testing"}, {"text": "Disease sub-notifi cation remains a major problem for veterinarian health authorities; despite notifi able diseases are of obligatory reporting, too often farmers (and even veterinarians and diagnostic laboratories) ignore or delay the notifi cation process owing to unawareness, minimization, or perceived lack of consequences, which may be aggravated when economic losses are anticipated. It is expected this scenario to worsen as POC tests become more readily available for utilization by farmers, especially in cases of delayed or misleading diagnosis based upon the clinical signs, as a result of disease underestimation or confusion with the signs of non-notifi able endemic diseases [ 12 ] . Of course, the interpretation of clinical signs itself and subsequent decision-making processes are compromised by the fact of farmers being unskilled personnel in health and veterinary medicine issues. Reducing the risk of nonreporting depends on tight cooperation and trust between veterinary authorities and livestock farmers and dealers [ 19 ] . In the livestock business, especially for important livestock diseases (e.g., classical swine fever), the risk of announcing a false-positive result is particularly worrisome, as it carries detrimental consequences in trade and export. Sanitary requisites on imported livestock for human feeding are very demanding and restrictive in most countries, leading to severe economic losses in cases of insuffi cient or inaccurate pathogen testing. Therefore, individual animal testing may be one of the main drivers for commercial development of POC tests, because a preliminary positive result with a POC test may prevent further and more expensive testing, while holding the herd being ineligible for export as well [ 12 ] . Some animal diseases are particularly contagious and able to spread rapidly. Many of them are considered transboundary diseases, meaning that their detection turns into the prohibition of livestock export and thus in economic losses.

For low-prevalence diseases, the proportion of falsepositive results is usually higher than for more prevalent ones. In addition, many of the current POC tests are less sensitive and specifi c than laboratory-based methods. Altogether, this means that, in order to achieve a desired level of performance and confi dence in the results, sampling a large number of animals is usually required for POC-based testing of low-prevalent diseases [ 12 ] . In pets, the prevalence of many pathogens, particularly of zoonotic parasites, has been probably underestimated as a consequence, among other reasons, of using inadequate and inaccurate diagnostic tests and procedures, including limitations in sample collection and processing, which may directly result in false-negative results [ 21 , 22 ] and, as such, putting the animals themselves and their owners at greater risk than currently assumed [ 3 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 150, "end": 156, "text": "[ 20 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 788, "end": 794, "text": "[ 12 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1127, "end": 1138, "text": "[ 21 , 22 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1240, "end": 1245, "text": "[ 3 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Diffi culties Faced by Point-of-Care Testing"}, {"text": "Intellectual property constraints frequently hamper the passage of these new devices from the proof of principle to the prototype and even commercialization levels. Another bottleneck is the high cost for fi nal development of such devices, the reason why partnerships between research laboratories and biotechnological companies are usually established with such purpose. In this case, of course, the economic leitmotiv is much higher for high-impact diseases, especially those for which control of outbreaks is diffi cult and expensive. However, even for such diseases (e.g., FMD), the only sporadic and unpredictable character of outbreaks might disincentive investments in individual testing; high demand usually only occurs by the occasion of an outbreak or suspected outbreak. Only a few tests for economically important livestock diseases have been developed and commercialized in developed countries, due to the limited market resulting from only infrequent diseases [ 12 ] . It seems that the most promising commercial segment for POC devices for veterinary pathogens concerns multiplexed platforms for a wide range of endemic and non-endemic pathogens [ 16 ] , taking advantage of the relative simplicity and low cost of incorporating several additional targets in a multiplexed test. Indeed, veterinary health services eagerly lack rapid and simple diagnostic devices designed for in-the-fi eld simultaneous detection, in a single sample, of a broader range of common pathogens [ 8 ] , thus enabling the rapid gathering of fi eld information on individual animals or whole herds disease status. Currently, simultaneous identifi cation and eventual subtyping of many pathogens in a single test run is a province of central or reference laboratories and only available if the demanding entity (e.g., person, laboratory, or agency) is able to afford to pay for such expensive testing. POC tests have been also used for fi eld differentiation between vaccine and fi eld strains, especially in endemic regions where vaccination is permitted [ 12 ] . Suitable application of such differential testing at slaughtering settings to confi rm prior livestock vaccination has been argued [ 1 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 975, "end": 981, "text": "[ 12 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1162, "end": 1168, "text": "[ 16 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1489, "end": 1494, "text": "[ 8 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2047, "end": 2053, "text": "[ 12 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2187, "end": 2192, "text": "[ 1 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Diffi culties Faced by Point-of-Care Testing"}, {"text": "The ultimate goal of the use of POC portable devices by unskilled and unsupervised practitioners will likely pose enormous challenges for the overall bioanalytical process, from sample acquisition to post-analytical data storage, interpretation, and management. Bearing in mind that most of these devices are to be commonly used in remote and low-resource regions, uncontrolled and irregular reporting of results, in addition to test biosafety, especially when dealing with zoonotic agents, are major issues [ 23 ] . For these reasons, a balanced merging between in-the-fi eld testing with remote data analysis and interpretation by competent clinical staff may be desirable. In this regard, telemedicine is an attractive system for healthcare improvement in developing countries, for allowing unskilled persons to provide useful healthcare in remote settings. This can be carried out by using miniaturized analytical devices with integrated hardware for image acquisition and software for storage of results. These results can be downloaded to hard copies or directly transferred online for a remote healthcare central unit for processing and interpretation by expert personal. Processed results can afterwards be returned to the tester, almost in real time [ 24 ] . Remote data from POC systems can still be incorporated in national disease surveillance and diagnostic systems, as the Threat Agent Detection and Response (TADR), developed under the Biological Threat Reduction Program (BTRP) of the US Defense Department's Defense Threat Reduction Agency. This system uses real-time polymerase-chain reaction (rPCR) for detection of pathogens. Another surveillance system, the Electronic Infectious Disease Surveillance System (EIDSS), contains a subsystem to report suspicious disease outbreaks in real time. The EIDSS is able to locate disease outbreaks through a geographic positioning device. This system aims to encompassing all available public and animal disease surveillance information. The EIDSS is able to report laboratory results from rPCR up to a few hours, depending on the distance. These systems will eventually enable a shift of paradigm in remote analysis, allowing world reference laboratories to simply handle and manage diagnostic information from pathogens and hosts based on biological samples remotely collected and analyzed, with subsequent reporting of results to the countries and regions of origin [ 1 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 508, "end": 514, "text": "[ 23 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1259, "end": 1265, "text": "[ 24 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2429, "end": 2434, "text": "[ 1 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Diffi culties Faced by Point-of-Care Testing"}, {"text": "A full evaluation program of POC tests must include performance evaluation (validation), quality assessment (control and assurance), and standardization [ 25 ] .

The quality assurance step demonstrates the readiness of the tests to be introduced into the routine diagnostic practice. Standardization is needed in POC diagnostics for veterinary applications, as well as new rules to compare results obtained from the two different methodologies-the POC and the laboratory-based method, respectively-which implicates in the fi nal (accepted) diagnostic result [ 23 , 28 ] . Proper validation and standardization of many POC tests frequently lack, in part because these often correspond to in-house rather than to well-standardized assays and techniques. It is thus important that national or reference healthcare entities establish quality assurance programs that guarantee the production of reference materials and protocols for effective quality control of rapid diagnostic tests [ 29 ] .

However, its advantageous use presumes the availability of suffi cient manpower to survey enough animals on high-risk premises, which remains a burdensome challenge. The decision of whether using them or not to manage animal infectious diseases depends on biological and epidemiological factors, on the specifi c circumstances in which clinical signs arise, on cost-benefi t issues (taking into account the costs for deployment, including equipment and reagent storage), and on the relative performance compared to diagnostic tests in reference laboratories. The possibility of sending suspect samples to a central laboratory within 24-48 h has probably discouraged the use of POC tests in some past situations in Western countries, e.g., under medical suspicion of highly pathogenic avian infl uenza (HPAI); from another point of view, this strengthens the idea of a promising use of these tests in remote regions, far away from laboratory settings. Once POC tests have equivalent analytical sensitivity and specifi city to laboratory-based tests, it may be foreseen, on the basis of a POC test alone, to take actions beyond simple restriction/quarantine on suspect premises [ 12 ] . Transboundary livestock diseases are probably among the major concerns in veterinary medicine. It has been proposed that an effi cient governmental control strategy of these diseases should include legislation enforcing, namely, (a) disease screening in people, conveyances, and goods arriving from other countries, in a reasonable extent, according to previously defi ned performance benchmarks, including possible use of robotic automated devices; (b) higher extent of screening for people, conveyances, and goods arriving from endemic countries, even reaching exhaustive screening when such countries are recognized as not making acceptable progresses in disease control; and (c) the need to develop tests to certifi cate animal product's region or country of origin, at the point of importation [ 1 ] .

Antibody-based detection requires a suffi cient level of antibodies to be produced for successful detection, which usually happens only some days after exposure to the pathogen. In this regard, specifi c detection of pathogen nucleic acids in biological samples by PCR-based methods may be more suitable, since the pathogen genomic material is present in the host from the very beginning of infection and even very little amounts are detectable before the onset of immune response markers or clinical or veterinary signs. Moreover, methods based in nucleicacid detection are able to detect both live and dead pathogens, an advantage for disease diagnosis [ 1 ] , especially when time is crucial for disease containment and control.

DNA microarrays (DNA chips) are usually produced in the form of highly dense arrays printed on a silicon or glass chip, coated with different probes for simultaneous detection of multiple DNA-target sequences [ 35 ] . Current microarrays can detect in the order of 10 4 nucleic-acid sequences on a single chip [ 1 ] . The Virochip is particularly well succeeded in this regard; it is a panviral DNA microarray platform, able to detect known viruses and new viruses related to known viral families, in a single assay. Its high robustness has been confi rmed with viruses of high genetic variability, as the swine virus. This platform is especially useful for detecting viruses for which there are no available reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assays [ 7 ] . Nevertheless, microarrays do not seem promising for the POC use, being too expensive, complex, and bulky [ 24 ] . Another peculiarity of DNAbased detection is the superior ability to differentiate strains from the same organism, especially when isolated from different geographical locations. This is useful not only for pathogen identifi cation but also for epidemiological studies. As an example, the signifi cant differences among the nucleic-acid sequences of the different serotypes of FMDV (as in other viruses) and the likelihood for the occurrence of typing errors during viral RNA replication demonstrate how the virus can rapidly evolve in nature [ 36 ] , which constitutes an enormous challenge for successful viral identifi cation. In infl uenza viruses, genetic reassortment is able to generate novel subtypes whose cell surface antigens might no longer be recognized by preexisting antibodies (antigenic drift) [ 37 ] . The potential for pandemics caused by novel highly pathogenic subtypes strongly stresses the need for specifi c subtype identifi cation through nucleic-acid testing. Of course, the drifting in infl uenza viruses, responsible for the sudden onset of dominant subtypes during a yearly season, requires not only rapid development and validation of suitable molecular probes for nucleic-acid tests but also the unobstructed use of such tests. Unraveling the pathogen subtypes circulating in a given region may assist in designing tailored vaccines and disease containment strategies, as well as tracking outbreaks' sources [ 38 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 299, "end": 305, "text": "[ 33 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 845, "end": 851, "text": "[ 34 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1063, "end": 1069, "text": "[ 35 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1164, "end": 1169, "text": "[ 1 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1605, "end": 1610, "text": "[ 7 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1718, "end": 1724, "text": "[ 24 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2270, "end": 2276, "text": "[ 36 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 2538, "end": 2544, "text": "[ 37 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 3166, "end": 3172, "text": "[ 38 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Advantages for Disease Diagnosis"}, {"text": "Most of the current POC tests for human and animal medicine still rely on antigen/antibody bioaffi nity reactions, but they are usually handicapped by relatively small sensitivity. Thus, there is a trend for shifting towards more sensitive nucleic-acid detection, usually based on DNA/DNA hybridization schemes. A major challenge for detection of pathogen nucleic acids in host body fl uids, apart their scarcity compared to antigenic proteins, is the confi nement inside pathogen cells, surrounded by hard biomembranes and cell walls. Consequently, the nucleic-acid levels present in host fl uids may be too low for successful diagnosis without prior target amplifi cation by PCR-based techniques. For blood infections in humans, the amount of human genomic DNA can be 10 14 times higher than that of pathogen DNA [ 39 ] , an important challenge in terms of sensitivity and selectivity. For POC testing, this constitutes a challenge for the miniaturization of the blood sample preparation step, especially in the case of gram-positive bacteria, whose cell walls are thicker and more rigid than those of gram-negative bacteria. The majority of available POC systems for clinical and veterinary applications require off-device sample preparation (including microorganism concentration and nucleic-acid extraction). This is a traditionally cumbersome and time-consuming step, especially for in-the-fi eld testing, but newer processes, including fi lter paper capture of nucleic acids and automated extraction procedures and kits, have been developed to simplify such task [ 40 ] . In parallel with POC device development, considerable efforts have been spent in the simplifi cation and robustness of sample preparation, in order to minimize manual handling, thus reducing cross-contamination and the effects from potentially interfering substances present during the nucleic-acid amplifi cation assay. Of note are the technical diffi culties inherent to the analysis of matrices such as feces, semen, and decomposing tissue or the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from saliva [ 12 ] . For these cases, it is necessary to incorporate, in POC devices, systems that are able to suppress such interfering substances and that reduce handling prior to the nucleic-acid amplifi cation step. PCR has been, by far, the most widely employed technique for nucleic-acid amplifi cation in laboratory analysis but also in POC tests. Many similar techniques have been originated from the basic PCR principles, including nucleic-acid sequence-based amplifi cation (NASBA), targeted for direct RNA amplifi cation, thus precluding the need for a previous reverse-transcription step. The development of this panoply of techniques for pathogen detection has been possible due to the increasing availability of whole genomic sequences; a remarkable case in veterinary science is the current possibility of rapidly distinguishing severe acute respiratory", "cite_spans": [{"start": 815, "end": 821, "text": "[ 39 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1570, "end": 1576, "text": "[ 40 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 2081, "end": 2087, "text": "[ 12 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Advantages for Disease Diagnosis"}, {"text": "syndrome (SARS) from other circulating coronaviruses [ 41 ] . Nevertheless, PCR is prone to false-positive results, as a result of unwanted amplifi cation of contaminant nucleic acids. Proper quality management of these issues requires using adequate controls for each stage of the testing process [ 12 ] . For RNA analysis through RT-PCR, storing biological samples at very low temperatures is crucial, owing to the high liability of RNA genomes. Innovative lyophilized reagents with enhanced sensitivities have signifi cantly improved the operational conditions for POC disease diagnosis [ 42 ] . Moreover, the need for improved stability of RNA used as an internal positive control, especially for real-time RT-PCR assays, has led to the search for new RNA sources. Another approach for improving RNA assays is the use of minor groove-binding probes which, by being short sized, are suitable for multiplexing and for targeting sequences of highly variable genomes [ 20 ] . Nevertheless, PCR-based techniques remain challenging for POC pathogen diagnosis in many endemic regions of the world. Even in human medicine, however, RT-PCR, for instance, is only used for clinically important specimens, due to the complexity and time demanding of this technique [ 43 ] . Linear-after-the-exponential PCR (LATE-PCR) is another PCR-based technique for detection of RNA. Probably its most known application is in FMDV subtyping, to tackle the diffi culty of targeting all fi eld strains with novel sequence mutations, even those in target sequences for which degenerate primers are being used [ 44 ] . The amplifi cation process can begin with as few as a single DNA molecule and abundantly generates amplifi ed product over a broad temperature range. The technique employs primers that hybridize to conserved genomic regions and a mismatch-tolerant probe able to target different variable sequences, depending on the temperature. Thus, the technique is especially convenient for detection of RNA viruses [ 36 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 53, "end": 59, "text": "[ 41 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 298, "end": 304, "text": "[ 12 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 590, "end": 596, "text": "[ 42 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 967, "end": 973, "text": "[ 20 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1258, "end": 1264, "text": "[ 43 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1586, "end": 1592, "text": "[ 44 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1998, "end": 2004, "text": "[ 36 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Nucleic-Acid Testing in the Point of Care"}, {"text": "Among the vast diversity of available nucleic-acid amplifi cation schemes and devices, both at the proof-of-concept and commercial levels, the technique of loop-mediated isothermal amplifi cation (LAMP), already widely used in laboratory analysis, seems quite promising for application in POC systems for pathogen detection and identifi cation. In remote PCR-based nucleic-acid testing, power supply is a keystone for device operation, although the use of rechargeable batteries is expected to circumvent this problem, by avoiding the need for an external power source [ 42 ] . Advantageously, LAMP does not require thermal cycling for the amplifi cation, rather making use of a simpler power source compared to a PCR thermocycler. Such operation at constant and low temperatures permits LAMP to be incorporated in polymer-based microdevices instead of more traditional and expensive materials, like glass and silicon that, for being temperature-resistant, are required for PCR-based devices. Unlike PCR, LAMP does not require a denatured template for amplifi cation, and given the usual abundance of generated DNA, the amplifi ed product can often be visualized directly [ 13 ] .

This is probably why existing tests have not been adopted in contingency plans in many countries, although the issue remains controversial [ 12 ] . During the FMD outbreak in 2007, up to 269 samples were analyzed each day [ 38 ] , but larger outbreaks would require higher-throughput testing.

Among microgravimetric methods, quartz-crystal microbalance (QCM) is the most common; it usually relies on the use of a piezoelectric crystal whose fundamental resonance frequency changes upon successive immobilization of a biorecognition probe and its target. However, the diffi culty of miniaturization, the high cost, and the complex infl uence of multiple interfacial parameters on the sensor response (especially in liquid phase) have hampered wider development of POC devices based on this technique.

In order to prevent some of the limitations of PDMS, other materials have been used, like paper and thermoplastics. These materials, as well as their fabrication process, are cheaper than PDMS, glass, and silicon, making large-scale fabrication more feasible. This low cost also encourages disposability, an important biosafety asset when dealing with infectious agents, and a way to avoid cross-contamination of biological samples. Moreover, these materials are lightweight and hence easy to transport in the form of portable devices. Finally, their fabrication does not require clean-room settings. Thermoplastics are attractive materials for simple, low-cost, and reproducible fabrication of POC devices by well-known replication molding techniques (e.g., injection molding or hot embossing). An example is poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), which is mechanically stable, is optically transparent, and has an easily modifi able surface.

Depending on their specifi c nature, for biosensing, nanomaterials may act as labels (including signal amplifi cation), as biomolecule immobilization supports, or even as probes for specifi c biotarget anchoring. Certain nanomaterials can also be used for pre-concentration of biological targets. Among these applications, labeling has been the most commonly employed. Label-based detection methods are usually more time-consuming and labor intensive than label-free methods due to the labeling steps. Labels have also limited shelf lives and are subjected to leakage from sensing surfaces. However, label-based methods usually provide superior performance, especially in terms of sensitivity, than label-free ones. Moreover, standardized protocols with labeling procedures are already available. Fluorescence labeling has been, by far, the most common approach in this regard, although suffering from pH sensitivity and photobleaching over time [ 53 ] . Such handicaps and the advent of nanoengineering have propelled the search and development of new and improved labels. Nanoparticles (NPs) have been the most widely employed type of nanomaterials for biosensing, especially metallic NPs. Metallic NPs are inorganic NPs that exhibit improved physicochemical characteristics compared to fl uorescent labels, including higher sensitivity. In general, they are suitable for construction of highdensity bioanalytical devices, taking advantage of their high signalto-noise ratio (S/N). They are easily synthesizable and functionalized (by simple mixing at room temperature) and have a controlled, self-assembled surface structure [ 24 ] . Gold nanoparticles (GNPs), in particular, are already used frequently in molecular diagnosis; some of their advantages include low toxicity and versatility for many specifi c biorecognition applications and schemes. One common way to enhance the GNP signal even further, and thus the sensitivity of detection, is the inclusion of a fi nal step of silver staining (\"silver enhancement\"), yielding detection schemes able to preclude the use of a prior PCR amplifi cation step. The high sensitivity exhibited by many NP-based detection layouts, especially in the form of microarrays, has enabled to avoid a prior step of nucleic-acid amplifi cation [ 69 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 512, "end": 518, "text": "[ 24 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1467, "end": 1473, "text": "[ 53 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 2149, "end": 2155, "text": "[ 24 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2804, "end": 2810, "text": "[ 69 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Nanotechnology"}, {"text": "Quantum dots (QDs) constitute another class of metallic NPs, able for fl uorescence tagging. They are much brighter and more photostable than conventional organic fl uorophores. Plus, their color can be directly correlated with size, while exhibiting very broad excitation wavelength windows, very narrow emission wavelength windows, and large Stokes shifts, allowing excitation at wavelengths far removed from their emission peaks [ 70 ] . Since QDs of different emission peaks (according to their different sizes) can be excited using a single wavelength excitation source, detection of multiple targets in complex biological systems is a hallmark of these NPs [ 71 ] . Another alternative to the overlapping of closely spaced fl uorescence emission peaks and consequent limitation of the maximum number of fl uorescent dyes that can be discriminated when simultaneously testing multiple pathogens in a single PCR tube is the use of masscode tagging, with a panel of distinct labels with different molecular weights. After an initial step of multiplexed (RT-)PCR using primers labeled with the masscode tags, unincorporated primers are removed, and the photo-cleavable tags of amplifying primers are then released by UV irradiation. Subsequent mass spectrometry analysis assigns each identifi ed tag to its specifi c pathogen [ 1 ] . In principle, the multiplexing ability will only be limited by the highest primer concentration contained by a PCR mix. The method was applied to the identifi cation of respiratory pathogens [ 72 ] and hemorrhagic viruses [ 73 ] . It offers a rapid, specifi c, sensitive, and cost-competitive alternative to conventional PCR and RT-PCR for disease diagnosis through POC devices.

Equivalent designations frequently found in the literature include \"magnetic nanobeads\", \"nanomagnets\", \"nanomagnetic beads\", \"nanomagnetic spheres\", and \"nanospheres\". They have been vastly employed in many biosensor layouts for diagnosis. Despite not matching the nanosize of molecular recognition probes and targets, their microscaled counterparts, magnetic microparticles, are frequently preferred as magnetic labels for biosensing in view of the easiness for detecting the lesser abundant microbeads by routine optical microscopy or by magnetic detection and by the easiness of the purifi cation process, thus allowing more effi cient removal of nonspecifi cally bound labels, with enhancement of the assay performance [ 74 ] . However, the higher S/V of nanobeads provides much more binding sites for bioprobe and biotarget anchoring and hence a higher S/N [ 5 ] . Very often, magnetic particles are used for target pre-concentration from large initial sample volumes and purifi cation, in parallel with the detection step itself being carried out through another particle that works as the label (e.g., fl uorophore or GNP). In this case, there is an initial capture of the target by the probe-functionalized magnetic particle, followed by releasing of the target (\"debinding\") for fi nal detection. Through magnetically controlled removal of nonspecifi cally bound beads (magnetic washing), improved sensitivity can be achieved upon elimination of the time-consuming washing step of nonspecifi cally bound molecules [ 75 ] . This process can, for example, improve signifi cantly the detection specifi city of genomic RNA, since RNA enrichment due to magnetic confi nement also precludes the effect of common interfering substances and common RNA inhibitors [ 76 ] . In addition, the use of magnetic beads permits testing optically opaque samples [ 29 ] , which is the case of many crude biological samples. Magnetic particles can be manipulated off-chip by a permanent magnet, making easier the design of disposable and inexpensive tests. Moreover, magnetic interactions are not affected by surface charges, pH, ionic strength, or temperature, being thus compatible with most biochemical processes [ 10 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 773, "end": 779, "text": "[ 74 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 912, "end": 917, "text": "[ 5 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1573, "end": 1579, "text": "[ 75 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}, {"start": 1814, "end": 1820, "text": "[ 76 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}, {"start": 1903, "end": 1909, "text": "[ 29 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2255, "end": 2261, "text": "[ 10 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Nanotechnology"}, {"text": "Unlike inorganic NPs, organic NPs have enhanced structural fl exibility and biocompatibility, while being biodegradable.

This is commonly achieved by fi lling liposome particles with dye and fl uorophore molecules, which amplify the response signal and are able to yield quantitative results. Another way of using liposomes in biosensing is in conjunction with resistive techniques. As such, negatively charged liposomes, upon binding to immobilized DNA chains (which are also negative), form giant negatively charged surfaces that repel the target DNA chain, leading to shifts in the electrochemical response [ 24 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 730, "end": 736, "text": "[ 24 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Nanotechnology"}, {"text": "In the last years, chemistry research has rendered a range of new structures based on carbon allotropes. The most promising for biosensing purposes seem to be carbon nanotubes (CNTs), both in the form of single-(SWCNT) or multi-walled CNTs (MWCNTs), depending on the number of cylindrical layers, with unique electronic properties and enlarged surface area for DNA immobilization. They also possess high electrical conductivity (similar to copper and much higher than in polymers), physical robustness, and chemical inertness. Each nanotube may act as an individual nanoelectrode, with suffi cient free space between neighboring nanotubes preventing the overlap of their diffusion layers, therefore yielding high S/N values and hence improved detection limits [ 77 ] . By providing high sensitivity, they are amenable to PCR-free detection. Their production is sometimes unacceptably irreproducible for ultrasensitive detection, but this has been circumvented by using cheap CNT arrays for multiple biological targets as a way of averaging out between different batches [ 78 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 760, "end": 766, "text": "[ 77 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}, {"start": 1070, "end": 1076, "text": "[ 78 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Nanotechnology"}, {"text": "The recent advances in nucleic-acid synthesis and modifi cation processes and the discovery of nucleic acids with catalytic and regulatory activities have prompted the development of nanoengineered nucleic-acid analogues with new and improved abilities for biorecognition and diagnostic purposes. Among them are aptamers; they are synthetic nucleic acids able to interact with molecular or cellular targets with high specifi city and sensitivity for their ability to fold into many tertiary conformations. Aptamers can be generated by \"Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment\" (SELEX), a combinatorial procedure that starts with a pool of candidate nucleic-acid molecules to generate a nucleicacid library [ 79 ] . Compared to antibodies, nucleic-acids can be synthesized in a more reproducible way, have longer shelf lives, and can be reversibly denatured without loss of activity. A remarkable characteristic of these probes for biosensing is that they do not require prior knowledge about the molecular differences between the specifi c target and nonspecifi c ones. As shown in cancer diagnosis, the DNA sequences from the DNA library that bind the cell-surface markers of a cancer cell can be determined by comparison with those that bind a healthy (control) cell. In addition, detection occurs before the corresponding antibody against that cancer has been produced [ 80 ] . This process is obviously attractive for application to the diagnosis of infectious diseases as well. The high selectivity and sensitivity achieved with aptamers permits eliminating sample pretreatment and is thus promising for POC applications [ 53 ] . The inability to distinguish the fl uorescent signal from labeled and unlabeled probes is a common problem in microfl uidic devices, since labeled probes that did not bind targets cannot be washed out from the microchannels. Different fl uorescent labels can be used to tag the probe and the target, with the detection proceeding via fl uorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) upon the occurrence of the bioaffi nity reaction. However, this procedure is unpractical in bioanalysis owing to the cumbersome dual labeling procedure [ 81 ] . In the case of DNA detection, this can be circumvented with the use of molecular beacons (MBs), which can be considered a particular type of aptamers. MBs are singlestranded oligonucleotides with a hairpin (stem-and-loop) structure, labeled with a fl uorophore in one extremity of the chain and a fl uorescence quencher in the other extremity. The close proximity between the extremities prevents fl uorescence emission, but when a hybridization event occurs with a complimentary chain, the structure becomes linearized and hence fl uorescence arises. In this way, target labeling is unnecessary. Another type of synthetic nucleic-acid analogues is constituted by peptide nucleic acids (PNAs), which are in which the sugar-phosphate backbone is replaced by a peptidic structure. When used as probes in nucleicacid recognition systems, they allow very selective and sensitive hybridization in low ionic-strength media, while having high thermal stability [ 82 ] . For being electrically uncharged, PNAs are suitable to promote the occurrence of biochemical events triggered by the formation of the negatively charged PNA/single-stranded DNA hybrid, i.e., a kind of \"on/off\" processes.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 724, "end": 730, "text": "[ 79 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF79"}, {"start": 1390, "end": 1396, "text": "[ 80 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF80"}, {"start": 1644, "end": 1650, "text": "[ 53 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 2186, "end": 2192, "text": "[ 81 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}, {"start": 3149, "end": 3155, "text": "[ 82 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF82"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Nanotechnology"}, {"text": "Biosensing schemes reported in the literature employing at least one of the nanotechnology-based structures described above are depicted in Table 2 , together with the transduction mechanism employed and performance quantifi cation. a Micro-scaled magnetic particle labels are also considered in this table", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 140, "end": 147, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "Nanotechnology"}, {"text": "The advances observed on the past decades in proteomics and genomics have led to the discovery of novel diagnostic biomarkers for pathogens relevant in human medicine. In parallel, cuttingedge developments in materials science and in nanotechnology have also been registered. Veterinary science and practice \"took the train\" and, as such, have been greatly favored from such advances. Microfl uidic technologies and nanoengineered structures, especially when coupled together, have led to an unprecedented degree of high-throughput, large-scale genetic analysis, even at wholegenome levels. Ultimately, the high-throughput and multiplexing abilities of in vivo (implanted or swallowed) nanosensor arrays should be able to monitor animals' physiology and health status during their entire lifetime, and even beyond, intended to track and assess the quality of animal products for human feeding. In this way, the current shortcomings related with the limited number of sanitary surveillance resources that can be allocated to guarantee proper product origin, stocking, and shipping could be circumvented. So far, only few POC schemes and devices have reached the exquisite sensitivity thresholds required for detection of nucleicacid traces in unamplifi ed biological samples, which is the ultimate goal of nucleic-acid testing. As for human diagnostics, the veterinary medicine and practice still lack the commercial availability of more POC devices, more probably as a result of manufacturing and commercial cost-effectiveness constraints than to a shortage of fundamental knowledge. While remaining too expensive for single testing, many tests targeted for POC diagnosis will ultimately prove to be cost-effective when savings with unnecessary laboratory manpower are taken into account. Other major challenges are the need for initial investments that are often prohibitive for small companies and the usual diffi culties for obtaining regulatory approvals for testing and commercialization. For effective improvement of human health, more adequate and coordinated actions to face animal diseases are needed, especially concerning livestock. This includes a more effective technology transfer from developed countries to those where diseases are prevalent and where disease preventive measures may be crucial to avoid or contain epidemics. Probably still without meritorious examples in the world, more effective communication and coordination among public health, animal health, and wildlife disease surveillance authorities will be necessary to tackle the problems posed by common and hazardous veterinary diseases, especially in situations of outbreaks endangering animal and human health as well.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans":
