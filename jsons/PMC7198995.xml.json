This immunologic memory is mediated by B and T cells and typically manifests as the presence of antibodies in sufficient concentrations to neutralize the pathogen as well as the rapid effector cell generation when this pathogen is encountered in real life (ie, a \u201crecall response\u201d). Immunologic memory can last for decades6, 7, 8 and thus provide lifelong protection against infection. To generate effective immunologic memory in response to vaccination, the specific orchestra of events must occur, starting from naive cell activation to memory cell formation and subsequent long-term memory cell homeostasis (overviewed in Fig 1\n). Any alteration in these events, both in quality and/or in quantity, can significantly influence the effectiveness of immune protection elicited by vaccines.",

After resolution of antigen, 90% to 95% of effector T cells die, with a small subset surviving as long-lived memory T cells.17\n,\n18 Memory cells provide protection against repeat antigen exposure, due to higher frequency of antigen-specific T cells as well as their poised effector state. In mice, the precursors that eventually differentiate into antigen-specific memory CD8 T cells can be identified at the peak of primary responses by the expression of IL-7 receptor \u03b1, while the vast majority of effector CD8 T cells express KLRG1 and are short-lived.19\n,\n20 Unlike CD8 T cells, definitive markers to identify memory precursors in the CD4 compartment have not been identified.21 However, CD4 TFH cells use a similar differentiation program as CD8 memory precursor T cells, which involves transcription factor networks of BCL6, TCF1, LEF1, and ID3. This is in contrast to the short-lived effector CD8 T-cell transcription factor network that involves BLIMP-1, RUNX3, and JUN.22 Recent studies have also shown that decreased CD25 expression by early effector CD4 T cells predicts memory T-cell number in mice23 and CD39 expression identifies short-lived effector CD4 T cells in humans.24 Thus, these transcription factors and surface receptors are potential markers for delineating memory precursors and TFH cells from effector T cells. Although the generation of short-lived effector cells is obviously critical for controlling pathogens in the context of infections, understanding signals favoring memory precursors or TFH cells is relevant in the context of vaccination.",

            "text": "Several factors have been identified that are involved in the pathway decision to develop into short-lived effector versus memory or TFH cells. Strong T-cell receptor (TCR) signal strengths (as measured by CD25 expression) favor terminal effector CD8 T cells, whereas memory precursor CD8 T cells are efficiently generated with relatively weaker TCR signals.23\n,\n25 Similarly for CD4 T cells, stronger signals appear to favor TH1 (ie, IFN-\u03b3 producing) cell development, whereas weaker signals are sufficient to induce TFH and TH2 cells,23\n,\n25\n,\n26 although longer dwell times appear to be necessary to develop germinal center TFH cells.27 In general, the distinction between signal strength and duration of stimulation is difficult in most experimental systems, and at the extreme, sustained stimulation can lead to exhaustion. Costimulatory signals such as CD27 are also required for optimal memory T-cell development.28\n,\n29 Equally importantly, inflammatory signals induced by the infection or adjuvanted vaccines determine memory T-cell fates.30 Prolonged exposure to inflammatory cytokines such as IL-12 and IL-2 during priming favors short-lived effector cells through the transcription factors T-bet and signal transducer and activator of transcription 5, whereas IL-10 and IL-21 improve memory precursor cell generation through signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 activation.19\n,\n31, 32, 33 Metabolic programming is another critical determinant of T-cell fate. Upon activation, T cells activate an aerobic glycolysis program that, by providing precursor molecules through the pentose phosphate pathway, supports their massive expansion and their differentiation into short-lived effector T cells. In contrast, memory precursor cells depend on oxidative phosphorylation to generate ATP. Metabolic interference to switch from glycolysis to mitochondrial respiration is effective in redirecting T-cell differentiation. Improved memory CD8 T-cell generation has been accomplished in mice by inhibiting glycolysis with 2-DG, inhibition of mTOR complex (mTORC) 1, and activation of adenosine monophosphate kinase.34, 35, 36 Collectively, significant progress has been made to understand the molecular mechanisms that drive the generation of TFH and memory cells versus short-lived effector T cells after infection and vaccinations. These insights from mice provide an excellent framework to examine how the vaccine response in humans is affected by age and design approaches that could improve vaccination efficacy.",

There are few studies on primary responses in humans, making it difficult to study these responses in aging. Early studies looking at primary vaccine responses in humans used a live, attenuated yellow fever (YF) virus vaccine, which is one of the most effective vaccines currently available. These studies demonstrated that older individuals have slower generation of antibodies as compared with young adults, coinciding with higher viremia at 5 days postvaccination.38 However, by 28 days vaccine-specific antibody levels were similar between age groups and viremia was controlled. A large clinical study similarly found equal titers of YF-neutralizing antibodies 30 days postvaccination across ages.39 These data suggest that the aging immune system has the potential to develop sufficient primary responses, albeit possibly at a slower rate. Additional YF vaccine studies, however, found that the neutralizing capacity of YF-specific antibodies at peak response (day 14) is lower in individuals older than 50 years, as was the effector response for CD8 T cells,40 suggesting that although the immune system can respond to develop sufficient immunologic memory for B cells and CD8 T cells, the generation of the effector phase may be compromised in older individuals. Moreover, although CD4 T cells specific to YF had similar frequencies across age, these cells were qualitatively much less polyfunctional in older adults compared with young. YF-specific CD4 T cells also showed significantly less long-term survival with age, implying ineffective development of immunologic memory for CD4 T cells.",

The production of IFN-\u03b3, a main effector cytokine, was significantly lower in the older cohort compared with the young, as was IL-10. IL-2 responses were similar between groups, together suggesting that memory T-cell polarization in response to vaccination is altered with age. Thus, from the limited data sets available, it appears that the ability of older individuals to mount primary vaccine responses fails in 3 distinct ways: impaired CD8 T-cell effector responses, reduced CD4 T-cell functionality, and possibly poor memory T-cell maintenance, although this last concept requires further, more detailed study.",

Indeed, although relatively similar in frequency, circulating influenza-specific TFH-like cells demonstrate lower IL-21 and inducible costimulator expression in older adults compared with young adults after vaccination, which could significantly impact high-affinity antibody generation within secondary lymphoid tissues (SLTs).50, 51, 52 However, because circulating TFH populations are distinct from those in tissues,53 further studies are required to truly determine the impact of aging on influenza-specific TFH frequencies and functionality.",

Unfortunately, immunity acquired naturally against this pathogen breaks down with age.60 Zostavax (Merck & Co, Whitehouse Station, NJ), a live attenuated variant of VZV, was developed to mimic infection and bolster the waning immune memory in older adults. Although it reduces the incidence of herpes zoster by approximately 50% in adults older than 60 years, its efficacy dramatically declines with age, where adults older than 80 years show only 18% vaccine efficacy.61\n,\n62 Moreover, the immune protection induced by the vaccine diminishes within 8 years after vaccination regardless of age.63\n,\n64 Thus, Zostavax does not generate robust long-term immunologic memory in older individuals. Somewhat surprisingly, Zostavax is able to generate similar CD4 T-cell responses in young and older individuals. However, the T-cell response reached maximum levels slower with age,65 in part because of a failure to expand preexisting large VZV-specific CD4 memory T-cell clones.66 Instead, Zostavax vaccination mostly recruited VZV-specific T cells from the naive repertoire, which in the absence of a booster vaccination may not reach sufficient frequencies to be protective. Moreover, CD4 T cells lose polyfunctional cytokine production with age.65 Most importantly, age is associated with an accelerated contraction of VZV-specific CD4 T cells immediately after vaccination-induced peak effector responses,67 possibly due to a preferential generation of short-lived effector T cells. Thus, although Zostavax appears to induce sufficient effector levels, the quality of this response is compromised with age, as is its ability to generate or maintain effective long-term memory T cells. Although Zostavax elicits vaccine-specific antibody production,68 little is known about how age affects the memory B-cell responses.",

Tetanus toxoid induces robust CD4 T-cell responses,89 which could potentially explain differential antibody responses. However, frequencies and functionality of circulating CD4 T-cell recall responses to both tetanus and diphtheria toxoid were similar across age groups.87 Moreover, the neutralizing capacity of diphtheria-specific antibodies was maintained in older individuals, suggesting sufficient TFH help.

Indeed, a key and highly reproducible feature of immune aging is the quantitative loss of naive T cells.93, 94, 95 This loss is much more prevalent in the CD8 compartment than in the CD4 compartment, in which the starting pool of naive CD8 T cells is lower than that of CD4 in young adults and contraction rates with age are higher. For example, a recent study quantified absolute numbers of naive T cells across age where naive CD4 T cells contracted from approximately 300 to approximately 200 cells/\u03bcL in 20- to 70-year-olds, respectively, and naive CD8 T cells contracted from approximately 200 to approximately 50 cells/\u03bcL.95 Whether this contraction alone is sufficient to alter the inherent ability of the naive T-cell repertoire to recognize specific antigens from new pathogens or vaccines as we age is unclear. However, this cellular contraction is in tandem with a significant loss of TCR diversity in both CD4 and CD8 naive compartments.96\n,\n97 A 4-fold contraction in diversity has been estimated with age, from approximately 20 \u00d7 106 unique receptors in young to approximately 5 \u00d7 106 in healthy older individuals for both CD4 and CD8 naive T cells,96 which implies a significant loss of unique antigen-specific naive T cells in older individuals. Consistently, diminished YF vaccine-specific CD8 and CD4 effector responses were found to be highly correlated with baseline frequencies of naive CD8 and CD31+ naive CD4 T cells, respectively.40 Collectively, an overall contraction of the naive T-cell repertoire together with lower cell numbers may account, at least in part, for reduced primary vaccine responses, although complete loss of recognition of specific antigens in the human repertoire is unlikely given the extensive diversity and cross-reactivity of the TCR.98\n",

As humans lose the ability to make new naive T cells via thymic output,101\n,\n102 the cause of this partial differentiation phenotype could be 2-fold: selection of long-lived, more memory-like cells and/or adaptation of naive cells to an aging (and possibility inflamed) tissue environment. The first scenario is intriguing because recent fate mapping studies in mice have found that the naive CD8 T-cell compartment in adults is composed of multiple subsets that have distinct developmental pathways and unique responses to infection.103\n,\n104 However, mathematically, an adaptation scenario is favored, where cells adapt to their environment, becoming more fit (ie, acquire a survival or proliferative advantage) with age.105 It is also more consistent with the loss of stem-like features and reduced plasticity we observe in naive T cells in older individuals,99\n,\n106 and in line with conversion of naive T cells to virtual memory\u2013like cells observed in mice with age.107\n,\n108 Virtual memory cells are a \u201cnaive\u201d cell population that acquires features of memory T cells without prior antigenic stimulation, driven instead by cytokine-mediated signaling.",

A similar finding is observed in response to the influenza vaccine, where older individuals generate multiple influenza-specific CD8 T-cell populations after vaccination but these populations displayed large clonal expansions and distinct TCR usage compared with younger adults.55\n,\n57 These data demonstrate that memory contraction during aging is insufficient to completely wipe out antigen-specific clones. Moreover, long-lived stem-like memory T cells, which have reacquired a naive phenotype,126\n,\n127 are relatively maintained across age.95 However, aging may cause expansion of certain clonotypes that subsequently dominate the immune recall response. Although excessive clonal expansion does not affect the overall phenotype or functionality, which is in contrast to the functional defects of T-cell exhaustion during chronic viral infection, their proliferative potential appears to be compromised.

Strikingly, the overall ability of memory T cells to expand postrecall seems relatively similar in numbers to that of young adults across multiple booster vaccines. This is also observed in vitro, with memory T cells from young and old displaying similar levels of proliferation after TCR stimulation.128 Moreover, aging memory T cells do not have an intrinsically altered ability to produce effector cytokines, including IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, and MIP-1\u03b1.129 This is consistent with both effector memory and central memory CD8 T cells from older individuals displaying intact epigenetic signatures of effector T cells,99 with recent unpublished data from our group (Hu, Jadhav, Weyand, and Goronzy, 2020) suggesting the same for memory CD4 T cells. If anything, binding motifs to bZIP family transcription factors such as AP-1 or basic leucine zipper ATF-like transcription factor that are important for effector cytokines transcription are more accessible with age. However, many vaccine responses in aging described above found reduced polyfunctional T-cell responses. Loss of polyfunctionality may be a consequence of more progressed or end-differentiation, as indicated by the chromatin state of old central memory T cells or the increased frequencies of terminally differentiated effector memory cells (TEMRAs).130 An alternative explanation is that memory T cells in older individuals respond qualitatively differently to TCR stimulation than in young. Indeed, similar to naive T cells, memory CD8 T cells display reduced miR-181a, which likely reduces some TCR-mediated signals. Interestingly, miR-181a knockout CD4 memory T cells display a preferential selection for higher affinity clones during recall.111 One could speculate that because TCR affinity has been shown to directly correlate with polyfunctionality,131 the down-tuning of TCR signaling in aging memory cells may cause selection for high-affinity survival but not have sufficient signaling to maintain optimal, broad polyfunctionality. In addition, the local cytokine milieu may influence polyfunctional T-cell responses in aging.132\n",

Consistently, after Zostavax vaccination, VZV-specific CD4 memory cells expanded at a similar rate between young and old; however, there was a more significant contraction of vaccine-specific cells, leading to an overall reduction in VZV-specific memory.67 CD4 T cells from older individuals also mount similar levels of effector responses against influenza vaccination but contract more, leaving less memory,133 indicating that memory T cells share a common feature of poor memory development upon recall.

There is growing evidence that, much like T cells, B cells also become dysfunctional with age. The most common feature of the aging vaccine responses is lower induction of functional vaccine-specific antibodies. Antibody functionality in this context varies but is usually determined by hemagglutinin inhibition assays for influenza, viral neutralization assays for YF, bacterial opsonization for Streptococcus pneumoniae, and antigen-binding antibody levels for most other responses including JEV, VZV, and hepatitis B. The development of protective antibodies requires multiple sequential steps similar to that of T cells and includes naive B-cell activation, cell expansion, and differentiation into antibody-secreting plasma cells. Moreover, the generation of memory B cells is essential to establish effective protection against subsequent pathogenic exposure. However, the induction of protective antibodies also uniquely requires class switch recombination (eg, the conversion of the B-cell receptor [BCR] from IgM to IgG or IgA isotype) and affinity maturation driven by BCR somatic hypermutation (eg, mutations of the BCR that increase antigen binding). These 2 processes are mediated by the enzyme AID.",

More importantly, several studies of the adjuvanted vaccine found significant improvement in influenza-related outcomes in older individuals, such as hospitalization due to vascular events or pneumonia, and at least a trend toward reduced incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza.145\n,\n146 Thus, the defect in vaccine responses seen in older individuals may not be an absolute feature of the aging immune system but a limitation of specific vaccination strategies. Increasing the antigen dose or using adjuvants to delay the clearance of antigen, in conjunction with the increased expression of costimulatory molecules, can overcome defects in T-cell activation and also compensate for lower frequencies of antigen-specific T cells. Booster vaccinations may also be needed more regularly, because larger memory T-cell clones in older individuals have a lower propensity to expand, and recall responses therefore rely on the expansion of infrequent antigen-specific T cells, as in primary responses. Interestingly, Shingrix, a vaccine that is highly efficient in preventing VZV reactivation across age, includes a booster vaccination.",

In the context of HIV vaccination, Cirelli et al148 have shown the superiority of slow delivery over conventional immunization in inducing more robust TFH-cell responses and germinal center B cells in rhesus monkeys.148 Moreover, although conventional bolus-immunized animals developed antibodies to nonneutralizing immunodominant epitopes of the envelope protein, slow delivery\u2013immunized animals targeted a more diverse set of epitopes. Although the methods of slow delivery immunization used in this study are not practical for population-wide vaccination campaigns such as those for influenza virus protection, the insights from this study are spearheading new approaches to improve vaccination in the elderly.",

Prolonged activation of the AKT-mTORC pathway favors the differentiation into effector T cells, which can be attenuated by mTORC inhibition.35 Initial human studies have used the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibition via rapalogs in the setting of influenza vaccination, finding increased generation of influenza-specific antibodies postvaccination.149 Sustained mTORC signaling as well as signaling of mitogen-activated protein kinase in older T cells is due to the overexpression of miR-21, raising the possibility that preventing the upregulation of miR-21 could be a promising avenue to skew T-cell differentiation pathways. Metabolic interference may also be successful to favor generation of memory T cells that rely on oxidative phosphorylation. Indeed, C1q has recently been shown as a mitochondrial activator that suppresses exuberant short-lived effector responses in CD8 T cells.150\n,\n151 Finally, genetically predisposed, CD39-expressing older individuals suppress TFH generation through the stimulation of the adenosine receptor A2AR24\n,\n114; in these individuals, interventions to prevent CD39 upregulation or A2AR signaling in the first 2 weeks after vaccination may be beneficial to improve B- and T-cell memory.",

In the human T-cell repertoire, approximately 1 in every 10,000 naive cells will be a vaccine (VAX)-specific cell. Upon exposure to vaccination, these cells become activated through engagement of their TCR, and other costimulatory receptors, and undergo massive clonal expansion. During this expansion phase, activated naive cells differentiate into short-lived effector cells or memory precursor cells (MPECs). TFH cells are generated, likely in a similar manner as MPECs, and provide critical help to B cells for the generation of high-affinity vaccine-specific antibodies. After resolution of vaccine antigen, most effector cells die. A small subset of MPECs survives to become long-lived memory T cells. These memory cells provide protection against subsequent infection or booster vaccination, possibly for decades, via a higher frequency of vaccine-specific cells, their poised effector state, and potential tissue localization. Recall responses after booster vaccination follow the same scheme, however, starting at higher initial frequency of VAX-specific T cells.",
