Textbooks, reviews, and conferences focusing on the airway frequently ignore this aspect of management, despite the observation that airway complications are significantly more likely to be associated with extubation than intubation.1 These complications range from the relatively minor, such as coughing and transient breath holding that have little impact on outcome, to those that are life-threatening. The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Closed Claims Project analyzed adverse respiratory events and found that 17% of brain injuries and deaths occurred after extubation in the operating room or postanesthesia care unit (PACU).2 Complications associated with extubation in critical care areas are likely to occur more frequently and have more serious consequences.3, 4\n",

The incidence of required reintubation ranges from 6% to 20%, and it depends on the clinical mix of patients,15, 17, 18 their critical acuity, critical care resources, and the threshold levels for extubation. Even if reintubation is successful, patients who failed their initial extubation had increased rates of ICU mortality and cost of care, prolonged ICU stay, and hospital length of stay.19 Compared with routine postoperative patients, intensive care patients are more likely to fail extubation because neurologic obtundation may leave them unable to protect their airways. Debilitation and impaired mucociliary clearance may interfere with pulmonary toilet, and diminished strength, altered pulmonary mechanics, increased dead space, and venous admixture may result in hypercapnic or hypoxemic respiratory failure.",

Intraoperatively, this may occur in the prone position, when the airway is shared with the surgeon, when the head and neck are extended, when draping obscures the view, or when drapes adhere to the endotracheal tube (ETT) or circuit and are carelessly removed. In the ICU, extubation may occur when the patient is repositioned for a radiograph or routine nursing care. Patients insufficiently sedated are at greater risk for deliberate self-extubation,38 but those more heavily sedated are more likely to require reintubation.39 Fastidious attention to securing and supporting the ETT and breathing circuit is essential. Self-extubation may occur during emergence from anesthesia, when the patient is confused, agitated, and distressed, which promotes premature extubation. In the ICU, it may not be possible to know whether a self-extubation is accidental or deliberate, but many of these patients require reintubation,40 are more likely to exhibit post-extubation stridor, and may need multiple intubation attempts, increasing the likelihood of esophageal intubation and death.41, 42, 43\n",

Partial transection of the tracheal tube by an osteotome during a maxillary osteotomy has resulted in the partially cut tube forming a barb that caught on the posterior aspect of the hard palate.54 One report of tube entrapment with fatal consequences involved a Carlens tube that was inadvertently sutured to the pulmonary artery.55 Lang and colleagues recommended routine intraoperative testing for tracheal tube movement when fixation devices are used in proximity to the airway.49 Uncertainty about tube movement should prompt fiberoptic examination before emergence from general anesthesia.",

These responses may be prevented by deep extubation,56 insertion of a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) before emergence, or attenuated by concurrent medication.57, 58, 59 Most healthy patients not on antihypertensive agents or other cardioactive drugs exhibit increases in heart rate and systolic blood pressure of more than 20% in association with extubation.60 After coronary artery bypass surgery, these changes tend to be transient, lasting 5 to 10 minutes, and they usually are not associated with electrocardiographic evidence of myocardial ischemia.61 Coronary sinus lactate extraction measurements, however, indicate that among patients with poor cardiac function, extubation may be associated with myocardial ischemia.62 Patients with inadequately controlled hypertension, carcinoid, pheochromocytoma, hypertension associated with pregnancy, or hyperthyroidism may be expected to display even greater increases in blood pressure in response to tracheal extubation. The specific strategies needed to attenuate these usually transient changes are dictated by the clinical context.

Retroarytenoidal edema restricts movement of the arytenoid cartilages, limiting vocal cord abduction on inspiration. Subglottic edema, a particular problem in neonates and infants, results in swelling of the loose submucosal connective tissue that is confined by the non-expandable cricoid cartilage. In neonates and small children, this is the narrowest part of the upper airway, and small reductions in diameter result in a significant increase in airway resistance. In children, laryngeal edema is promoted by a tight-fitting ETT, traumatic intubation, intubation longer than 1 hour, coughing on the tracheal tube, and intraoperative alterations of head position.94 Koka and coworkers found an incidence of 1% among children younger than 17 years. Laryngeal edema should be suspected when inspiratory stridor develops within 6 hours of extubation. Management of laryngeal edema depends on its severity. Treatment options include head-up positioning, supplemental humidified oxygen, racemic epinephrine, helium-oxygen administration, reintubation, and tracheostomy.",

A positive history of nocturnal dry cough, exertional wheezing, or more than three wheezing episodes in the prior 12 months was associated with a fourfold increase in the risk of laryngospasm in the PACU and a 2.7-fold increased risk of airway obstruction during surgery or in the PACU.108 Twice as many children were managed with an LMA than an ETT, and an equal number had their devices removed awake and asleep. The depth of anesthesia at the time of device removal did not influence the incidence of laryngospasm.",

This is protective to the extent that it prevents aspiration of solids and liquids. It becomes maladaptive when it restricts ventilation and oxygenation. The intrinsic laryngeal muscles are the main mediators of laryngospasm, and they include the cricothyroids, lateral cricoarytenoids, and thyroarytenoid muscles. The cricothyroid muscles are the vocal cord tensors, an action mediated by the SLN. Management of laryngospasm consists of prevention by either extubating at a sufficiently deep plane of anesthesia or awaiting recovery of consciousness.56 Potential airway irritants should be removed and painful stimulation should be discontinued. If laryngospasm occurs, oxygen by sustained positive pressure may be helpful, although this may push the aryepiglottic folds more tightly together.109 Larson described a technique of applying firm digital pressure anteriorly directed to the \u201claryngospasm notch\u201d between the ascending mandibular ramus and the mastoid process and observed that this technique is rapid and highly effective.110 Very small doses of a short-acting neuromuscular blocker with or without reintubation may be necessary.111, 112\n",

This complication may be more common than the literature indicates.92, 141 Persistent post-extubation hoarseness, a breathy voice, and an ineffective cough should prompt assessment by an otolaryngologist. The diagnosis is confirmed by endoscopic visualization of an immobile vocal cord associated with a rotated arytenoid cartilage.88 If the diagnosis is made early, before the onset of ankylosis, it may be possible to manipulate the arytenoid back into position.",

If seen, they are bowed. This produces hoarseness with reduction in volume and range but no obstruction. Unilateral RLN injury causes the vocal fold to assume a fixed paramedian position and produces a hoarse voice. There may be a marginal airway with a weak cough.

Smoke inhalation or thermal injuries are examples of intrinsic injuries. Burn patients are at particular risk of requiring reintubation. They can have bronchorrhea, impaired mucociliary clearance and local defenses, laryngeal and supraglottic edema, increased carbon dioxide production, and progressive acute respiratory distress syndrome. Carbon monoxide may also diminish their level of consciousness and the ability to protect their airway. It may be difficult to secure the tracheal tube because of involvement of the adjacent skin, and burn victims may be agitated or uncooperative, increasing the risk of unintended extubation.148 Kemper and coworkers reported their management of 13 burn patients younger than 15 years, 7 of whom exhibited post-extubation stridor. Patients treated with helium-oxygen mixtures had lower stridor scores than patients treated with an air-oxygen mixture.149 They found that 11 of 30 extubated burn victims required treatment for stridor after extubation, consisting of racemic epinephrine, helium-oxygen, reintubation (n = 5), or tracheostomy (n = 1).

Ten of 82 patients with leak volumes of 110 mL or less developed post-extubation stridor, and 10 of 380 with larger leaks developed post-extubation stridor, giving a positive predictive value for stridor of 0.12 and negative predictive value of 0.97. The sensitivity and specificity of the test under these conditions were 0.50 and 0.84, respectively.150 With leak volumes of 15.5% or less, 7 of 48 patients developed post-extubation stridor, and 13 of 414 patients with volumes greater than 15.5% developed stridor, yielding positive and negative predictive values of 0.15 and 0.97, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of this test for post-extubation stridor were 0.35 and 0.91, respectively. The prevalence of post-extubation stridor was 20 of 462. Seven of these patients required reintubation; 15 were managed with racemic epinephrine or helium-oxygen mixtures, or both, and 2 of the 15 failed, requiring intubation. The investigators concluded that neither threshold adequately predicted post-extubation stridor or could justify delaying extubation.",

The increase in venous pressure is aggravated by a lowered alveolar pressure, resulting in transudation of fluids into the pulmonary interstitium and alveoli. It may also result in a rightward shift of the interatrial and interventricular septa, raising left atrial and ventricular pressures.

Indirect laryngoscopy carried out 4 to 6 hours after surgery revealed mucosal hemorrhage or laryngopharyngeal swelling in 32% of cases. Because the patients undergoing tracheostomy were not described, it is possible that the low incidence of reintubation resulted from an aggressive approach to preemptive tracheostomy.",

O'Sullivan and coworkers reported a similar experience for six patients with airway obstruction after carotid endarterectomy.188 Stridor was not relieved by wound evacuation. Administration of muscle relaxants made manual mask ventilation and tracheal intubation virtually impossible due to marked glottic or supraglottic edema. Cyanosis and extreme bradydysrhythmias or asystole occurred in four patients. The providers endorsed Kunkle's recommendation for wound evacuation but thought that much of the airway compromise was caused by edema from venous or lymphatic congestion. They emphasized that the outward appearance may lead to an underestimation of the situation's gravity. Voice changes are early signs of danger and may be relatively subtle.

They compared the CT scans of 19 patients before and after carotid endarterectomy surgery.185 Clinically, 1 patient had severe swelling, 4 had moderate swelling, and 3 had mild swelling, but 10 were deemed normal. However, postoperative CT scans demonstrated significant swelling of the retropharyngeal space and a reduction of the anteroposterior and transverse airway diameter, particularly at the level of the hyoid. Compared with preoperative CT scans, the calculated volume reduction averaged 32% \u00b1 7% for extubated patients. The scans revealed a wound hematoma estimated to be greater than 10 mL (range, 44 to 94 mL) in 5 of 19 patients. Patients who remained intubated postoperatively showed a significantly greater volume reduction of 62% \u00b1 9% (P < 0.025). Those remaining intubated as a result of swelling had contralateral extension of the swelling. These observations may help to explain why opening the wound frequently fails to provide benefit in many patients. Nonetheless, it may be difficult to clinically differentiate bleeding from swelling. After radiologic demonstration of swelling, the same group evaluated the benefits of prophylactic dexamethasone but failed to demonstrate any clinical benefit.190\n",

The decision to re-explore was made in the PACU for 7 patients; the remaining 35 were identified in the ICU or ward. Only one patient required a surgical airway when direct laryngoscopy failed in the ICU. Several techniques were initially employed: awake bronchoscopic intubation (15 of 20 of which were successful), direct laryngoscopy after induction (13 of 15 were successful), and awake direct laryngoscopy (5 of 7 were successful). When awake bronchoscopy failed, direct laryngoscopy was successful whether the patient was awake (3 of 3) or asleep (2 of 2). When direct laryngoscopy initially failed after induction in two patients, it succeeded after opening the incision. When awake direct laryngoscopy failed, one patient required a surgical airway; in the other, direct laryngoscopy succeeded after opening the incision. Despite the size of this series, it is not possible to draw conclusions about which techniques are most successful. Success likely depends on the skill and judgment of the airway manager. It is also possible that this study differed from the other studies in that the decision to re-explore was made earlier and patients had less airway distortion.",

The subsequent endarterectomy, done 4 weeks later under deep cervical plexus block with subcutaneous infiltration, caused intraoperative airway obstruction and asystole. The airway was secured, but repeated attempts at extubation resulted in persistent obstruction due to bilateral hypoglossal nerve palsy. In another case, performed under cervical plexus block, the patient developed bilateral vocal cord paralysis that required intubation and subsequent tracheotomy. It is suspected that she had a previously unrecognized contralateral vocal cord palsy from a prior thyroidectomy.193 In this case, the vocal cord dysfunction was co-incident with retraction of the carotid sheath\u2014although it can also be induced by a cervical plexus block\u2014but it raises the importance of the preoperative assessment of patients who have had prior head and neck surgery.",

This surgical approach requires tracheal and esophageal retraction toward the opposite side to permit exposure. Drains were placed, and all patients were immobilized by a halo vest or a rigid head-cervical-thoracic orthosis. They identified seven patients (5.3%) who required postoperative reintubation, and although they did not compare these patients with those not requiring reintubation, they attempted to identify common features that increased the risk of postoperative airway compromise. Three patients were immediately reintubated in the operating room, and four were reintubated 12 to 91 hours postoperatively. Severe hypopharyngeal swelling was observed at reintubation in four of seven patients and possibly in a fifth. Five of the seven reintubations had no serious sequelae; these patients were extubated within 2 to 8 days. One patient required a cricothyroidotomy, but delay resulted in hypoxic encephalopathy and death. Another patient was reintubated but developed and succumbed to severe adult respiratory distress syndrome. The investigators think that preexisting pulmonary disease, moderate or severe preoperative myelopathy, extensive multilevel decompression with prolonged surgery, and tissue retraction were risk factors for postoperative airway obstruction, but there were no controls.26 They recommended 1 to 3 days of elective intubation postoperatively, a cuff-leak test, and direct laryngoscopy at extubation.",

By the fourth postoperative day, a cuff leak was detected, and the patient was successfully extubated over a tube exchanger. Hogan and Argalious described a patient in whom maxillomandibular advancement was performed for OSA.202 The procedure lasted 9 hours, during which he received 7200 mL of crystalloid and 500 mL hetastarch. He remained intubated overnight, and after demonstrating adequate spontaneous ventilation and a cuff leak, he was extubated (over a 19-F AEC). Extubation was immediately followed by clinical evidence of airway obstruction, and he was reintubated. The obstruction was attributed to fractured hardware and a hematoma in the piriform fossa that caused extrinsic compression. This could easily have resulted from periglottic edema.

Gunshot wounds or physical altercations also cause maxillofacial injury. Airway obstruction is a primary cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients, and many die before they reach the hospital.203 Those with less life-threatening injuries are likely to present with a full stomach, and many have associated head and neck injuries, lacerations, loose or avulsed teeth, intraoral fractures, and fractures extending into the paranasal sinuses, into the orbit, or through the cribriform plate. They may also have an unstable cervical spine or damage to the neural axis. Injuries to the lower face raise the possibility of a laryngeal fracture. Intermaxillary fixation may be part of the surgical plan, necessitating a nasal intubation or a surgical airway. Timing of tracheal extubation is complex and must take into consideration factors such as the patient's level of consciousness, ability to maintain satisfactory gas exchange, coagulation status, and integrity of protective airway reflexes. Attention must be paid to the difficulties originally encountered in securing the airway and an evaluation of whether reintubation would be easier or more difficult after surgery and resuscitation. Most of the trauma literature about airway management addresses intubation and offers little help with extubation, making cooperation between the anesthesiologist,204, 205 surgeon, and critical care physician essential. Intermaxillary fixation requires wire cutters to be immediately available and personnel to know which wires to cut. A flexible bronchoscope, provisions for an emergency surgical airway, and the required expertise should be immediately available at the time of extubation. Alternatives include prophylactic tracheotomy, submental intubation,206, 207, 208 nasal intubation, and bronchoscopic airway evaluation performed before extubation,209 although assessment may be limited to supraglottic structures and exclusion of tube entrapment. Ideally, extubation should be accomplished in a reversible manner, permitting supplemental oxygenation, ventilation, and reintubation if needed (see \u201cExtubation Strategies\u201d).",

In expert hands, bronchoscopy-assisted intubation can often be achieved.210 When this is unsuccessful or constitutes a significant risk of rupturing the abscess, a surgical airway before incision and drainage may be called for.211 Potter and colleagues retrospectively compared the outcomes of 34 patients in whom a tracheotomy was performed with 51 patients who remained intubated after surgical drainage.212 All patients had undergone surgical drainage for impending airway compromise and required airway support postoperatively. It was not always evident to the investigators why a particular strategy was chosen, and these groups were not likely identical. Airway loss occurred more commonly in the intubated patients, but this characteristic was not statistically significant. Two deaths occurred, one resulting from an unintended extubation and the other from post-extubation laryngeal edema and an inability to reestablish the airway. The latter patient had a cuff leak before extubation, and signs of obstruction developed 30 minutes after the ETT was removed. Surgical drainage rarely results in immediate airway improvement, and reintubation or emergent placement of a surgical airway, if required, may be complicated by edema, tissue distortion, and urgency.",

Stridor was observed immediately, and bag-mask and laryngeal mask ventilation were ineffective. Attempts to reintubate the patient were unsuccessful, necessitating a cricothyroidotomy. Subsequent direct laryngoscopy showed a markedly swollen epiglottis and grossly edematous laryngeal and hypopharyngeal tissues. The patient developed negative-pressure pulmonary edema, and a tracheostomy was performed 2 days later because of persistent swelling. Tracheal decannulation occurred uneventfully 2 weeks later.

Intubation is not more difficult; extubation is the challenge. This uncommon and poorly understood condition is frequently mistaken for refractory asthma or recurrent laryngospasm.227, 228, 229 The diagnosis is both overlooked and overused, leading to confusion.230 It also is called vocal cord dysfunction, Munchausen stridor, psychogenic stridor, factitious asthma, pseudoasthma, and irritable larynx syndrome.230, 231 Normal vocal cord motion involves inspiratory abduction and 10% to 40% adduction on expiration. With PVCM, adduction of the true vocal cords occurs on inspiration or expiration, or both. The false vocal cords and the posterior laryngeal wall may further contribute to the airway obstruction.231, 232, 233, 234 This condition may be associated with psychosocial disorders, stress, exercise, gastroesophageal reflux, irritant exposure, or airway manipulation. Pulmonary function tests show normal expiratory but flattened inspiratory flow loops. It is important to differentiate this condition from asthma, laryngospasm, anaphylaxis, angioedema, gastroesophageal reflux, and vocal cord paralysis. The incidence of PVCM is unknown.",

Its mobility is vital for speech, respiration, and protection from aspiration. Inflammatory changes may include effusion, pannus formation, joint erosion, and ankylosis, any of which may compromise the joint's functions. Its involvement may be unsuspected or mistaken for asthma until intubation or after extubation and may necessitate a surgical airway.258, 259 Dysphonia, dyspnea, or stridor should raise suspicion of this possibility. Complete airway obstruction is a well-described but uncommon complication, despite involvement of the cricoarytenoids in 26% to 86% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis.251, 259 Laryngoscopy may reveal a rough and thick mucosa with narrowing of the vocal chink. Although airway obstruction occurs most commonly in patients with long-standing rheumatoid arthritis with polyarticular and systemic involvement, laryngeal stridor has been described as the sole manifestation of this disease.260\n",

Retrospectively reviewing 128 consecutive posterior cervical procedures, upper airway obstruction characterized by stridor occurred in 9 of 128 patients, 1 of 70 patients intubated with bronchoscopic guidance, and 8 of 58 patients intubated otherwise (i.e., direct laryngoscopy or blind nasotracheal technique). Five patients (all in the nonbronchoscopic group) required emergency reintubation that proved to be very difficult, with two near fatalities and one death. Although the two groups were similar with regard to age, gender, American Rheumatology Association classification, ASA physical status, duration of surgery and anesthesia, fluid balance, and postoperative immobilization, there were significant differences in time to extubation. Seven of the patients could not be intubated by flexible bronchoscopy and were therefore intubated by a nonfiberoptic technique. The patients were not randomized to different methods; criteria for the method of intubation and techniques were not described; all patients were intubated awake; and the study was carried out over an 11-year period.261 Although it is not possible to draw firm conclusions from this study, there was a high incidence (7%) of post-extubation stridor and difficult or failed reintubations, regardless of the intubation technique.",

Several investigators have recommended postponing extubation until the patient is wide awake. Unfortunately, this provides increased protection against nothing other than laryngospasm and aspiration. The prevailing wisdom is that patients with limited mouth opening and a potentially unstable cervical spine should be intubated with a flexible bronchoscope.250 This method involves blind passage of the ETT through the cords, which may be traumatic,91, 261 particularly in the face of preexisting cricoarytenoid arthritis. Regional anesthesia should be considered as an alternative to general anesthesia when appropriate. When intubation cannot be avoided, proposed extubation strategies include a preemptive tracheostomy or a method that increases the reversibility of extubation. Neither strategy has been prospectively evaluated in this population.",

The pathophysiology and perioperative airway management of OSA in obese patients has been comprehensively reviewed.274, 275, 276 Many surgical patients have undiagnosed or untreated OSA. OSA syndrome is associated with an increased risk of gastroesophageal reflux, difficult mask ventilation276, 277, 278 and laryngoscopic intubation,279, 280, 281, 282 and accelerated arterial oxygen desaturation.276, 283 The risk of airway obstruction after surgery is increased for patients with OSA; life-threatening post-extubation obstruction occurred in 7 (5%) of 135 patients.279, 284 Rapid desaturation, difficult mask ventilation, and difficult direct laryngoscopy make this a particularly high-risk setting.285 The ASA practice guidelines for the management of patients with OSA provided limited guidance beyond a strong recommendation that they be fully awake and that the airway manager verify that neuromuscular blockade is completely reversed before extubation. If possible, extubation and recovery should be carried out in the lateral or semi-upright position,286 nasal CPAP should be available or routinely implemented, and consideration should be given to extubation over a tube exchanger.274, 276, 280, 284, 287 These strategies have been associated with better outcomes, and anecdotal comparisons are compelling, but they have not been subjected to controlled, randomized trials, and they were not addressed by the ASA Task Force.",

Four hours after extubation, 4 (20%) of 20 patients aspirated dye; 3 had massive aspirations. At 24 hours, the rate was reduced to 5%. In this study, patients had been intubated for 8 to 28 hours during and after cardiac surgery. Although the investigators did not observe a relationship between duration of intubation (8 to 28 hours) and aspiration, it is unclear whether the presumed laryngeal incompetence occurs after brief intubation or is more common and severe with prolonged intubation. The mechanism of laryngeal incompetence was postulated to be primarily sensory because patients who aspirated dye did not cough.",

Factors predisposing a surgical patient to aspiration include emergency surgery, pain, obesity, narcotics, nausea, ileus, bowel obstruction, pregnancy, some surgical positions, depressed level of consciousness, inadequate depth of anesthesia, postoperative drowsiness, and residual neuromuscular blockade. Despite the ubiquity of these conditions, perioperative aspiration is not commonly identified. Before intubation, difficult bag-mask ventilation may result in gastric distention, which may be further complicated if laryngoscopy proves difficult because it may delay securing the airway. Repeated laryngoscopic attempts may cause edema, thereby increasing glottic resistance. Aspiration may also result from obtundation or conditions that impair vocal cord apposition (e.g., vocal cord paralysis, laryngeal incompetence, residual neuromuscular blockade, granulomas). Aspiration can cause serious morbidity and death.292, 293, 294, 295\n",

Premature extubation, postoperative nausea, delayed gastric emptying, residual neuromuscular blockade, relaxation of the esophageal sphincters, decreased level of consciousness, gagging on an ETT, supine recovery, and impaired laryngeal competence may make emergence from anesthesia and tracheal extubation as problematic as induction. A kinked or clamped nasogastric tube may promote regurgitation and aspiration. Evidence-based recommendations on an extubation strategy to reduce aspiration are not available. It would seem logical to minimize the contributing factors: postoperative nausea and vomiting, residual neuromuscular blockade, decreased level of consciousness and associated diminished protective airway reflexes, and gastric evacuation. We do not know whether gastric decompression reduces aspiration; a well-seated i-gel SGA297 or ProSeal LMA may or may not offer some protection from aspiration.298, 299, 300 With the current information, it is not appropriate to recommend the elective use of these devices in a patient at increased risk for aspiration.",

Deep extubation ordinarily occurs after full recovery of neuromuscular function and the resumption of spontaneous ventilation. Its purported advantage is avoidance of the adverse reflexes associated with extubation, such as hypertension, dysrhythmias, coughing, laryngospasm, and increased intraocular or intracranial pressures. The fundamental disadvantage of deep extubation is the patient's inability to protect his airway against obstruction and aspiration. When deep extubation is improperly executed, laryngospasm and its attendant complications are more likely to occur. Although not having to wait for the recovery of consciousness may accelerate operating room turnover, this approach is more difficult to justify when anesthetic agents having a faster elimination time are available. Delays in recovery usually are brief. Unscavenged volatile anesthetic agents may also represent an occupational health hazard. A significant proportion of American anesthesiologists practice the technique, at least some of the time, but there are few data for adults that compare the safety of deep extubation with that of awake extubation.12 Koga and colleagues compared three small groups of adult patients who underwent deep extubation, awake extubation, or deep extubation after the insertion of an LMA.80 Straining occurred in a high (but comparable) proportion of patients whether the ETT was removed before or after recovery of consciousness.",

The LMAs were removed when the patients resumed spontaneous ventilation and obeyed commands. None of the 10 patients coughed, and changes in the rate-pressure product (indicating cardiac oxygen requirements) were minimal. The investigators concluded that the technique might prove useful in patients undergoing other types of surgical procedures. They stressed that this substitution should be performed only by those skilled in LMA insertion. Patients must be at a sufficient depth of anesthesia or coughing, breath-holding, laryngospasm, and the very pressor responses this substitution is intended to avoid may occur. Bailey and others recommended that the LMA be inserted before removal of the ETT to prevent losing the airway after tracheal extubation.80, 305 Compared with deep tracheal extubation followed by Guedel airway insertion, there was a lower incidence of coughing and requirement for airway manipulation.305 Koga and coworkers compared this technique with deep and awake tracheal extubation.80 They observed no difference in recovery conditions between patients in whom the ETT was removed by deep or awake methods; however, they noticed a significant improvement in recovery conditions when the LMA substitution was performed. This technique is useful but can jeopardize a secure airway if not properly executed. It should be practiced on routine airways before use in higher-risk extubations.306 Brimacombe suggested (personal communication, December 2010) that a ProSeal LMA or LMA Supreme with a gum elastic bougie inserted through the drainage tube could produce a more secure substitution for an ETT.307\n",

A bronchoscope (<4 mm) can be inserted through the device, leaving 3 or 4 cm protruding beyond its tip. A 7-mm or larger ETT can be advanced over it. Only the distal 3 to 4 cm of the protruding bronchoscope is flexible, but it is usually sufficient to allow successful maneuvering into the trachea, after which the SGA is removed and a replacement ETT is advanced over the Aintree catheter. A Rapi-Fit adapter is provided to enable positive-pressure ventilation while the substitution is performed. The Aintree intubation catheter and FOB are inserted together through the SGA. There are several advantages of this technique.315, 317 It can be used to facilitate conversion from an unmodified LMA to an oral ETT of adequate size. Sufficient length allows the LMA to be removed with minimal risk of losing the airway. The Aintree intubation catheter fits tightly to the insertion cord of the FOB and to the ETT, thereby reducing the size discrepancy that often results in difficult glottic passage. The catheter can be used as a conduit for manual or jet ventilation during an exchange. An LMA Classic, inserted as a rescue device (for \u201ccannot intubate, cannot ventilate\u201d cases) can facilitate safe tube exchange without the need for an intubating LMA.",

For a spontaneously breathing patient, extubation over an FOB provides the opportunity of visually assessing the trachea and laryngeal anatomy and function. This can help in the patient suspected of having tracheomalacia, vocal cord paresis, or PVCM. It also permits assessment of supraglottic structures.318 These opportunities can be maximized by reassuring the patient and by providing judicious sedation, an antisialagogue, and the use of a Yankauer sucker for oral secretions. The oropharynx is suctioned, taking care to avoid inducing a gag reflex. The FOB is placed above the carina, and the cuff is slowly deflated to minimize coughing. The ETT is slowly withdrawn into the oropharynx, followed by very gradual withdrawal of the FOB to the supraglottic region. After the patient is comfortable, the FOB is further withdrawn to a position just above the vocal cords. Even with this deliberate technique, the exercise is frequently frustrated by excessive secretions, coughing, swallowing, or poor tolerance with insufficient opportunity of visualizing the structures of interest.",

After the substitution is performed and the patient is under anesthesia or a suitable degree of sedation, muscle relaxation can be reversed and spontaneous ventilation allowed to resume. An FOB is then passed through the SGA, and vocal fold movement and appearance can be assessed while the concentrations of oxygen and volatile agents (if necessary) can be controlled.

They provide a 15-mm connection or a Luer-Lok jet ventilation attachment and were designed for rapid removal and reattachment while the tracheal tube is being off-loaded and replaced. The length and IDs (1.6 to 3.4 mm) make manual ventilation with a resuscitation bag possible but useful only for short periods because resistance is very high. The Luer-Lok jet Rapi-Fit connector allows jet ventilation, but the paucity of distal side holes potentially increases catheter whip and the risk of barotrauma.333\n",

Cough effort tended to be reduced with the larger CAEC, but this did not achieve significance.

The tube exchanger was left in place until the need for reintubation was considered unlikely. Over a 9-year period, 354 patients qualified. Two groups emerged: those who required reintubation while the AEC was still in place and another group who required reintubation within 7 days but after the AEC had been removed. Airway-related complications were compared for the two groups. The AEC dwell time was a mean of 3.9 hours (range, 5 minutes to 72 hours). Of 354 patients, 288 were extubated in the ICU and had previously required three or more laryngoscopic attempts or alternative devices to achieve intubation. Comparing the overall success rate in the two groups, 47 of 51 patients in the AEC group were successfully reintubated, 87% on the first attempt. The four failures in this group resulted from inadvertent removal of the AEC in three; one patient was rescued with an intubating LMA and flexible bronchoscope. Mild (SpO2 < 90%) and severe hypoxia (<70%) were experienced by three and four patients, respectively. Of the 37 patients requiring reintubation without an AEC, the first pass success rate was only 14%, with mild and severe hypoxia in 50% and 19%, respectively; three or more laryngoscopy attempts in 28 of 36 patients; and the need for a rescue device in 32 of 36 patients.336 In all cases, reintubation was attempted by a member of an anesthesia airway team: an attending anesthesiologist or a resident under direct supervision. Although reintubation over an AEC does not guarantee first-pass success, this strategy was strikingly more effective (87% versus 14% first-pass success) and had far fewer life-threatening complications.",

Four of the cases involved a double-lumen tube converted to a conventional ETT or a nasal to oral conversion. Thirty-seven patients had previously difficult intubations requiring multiple attempts or a rescue technique. Most of the patients were obese or morbidly obese and had a positive fluid balance of more than 10 L over the previous 4 days. The intention of the study was not to compare the specific devices but rather to evaluate the advantages of visually directing the tube exchange. Mort reported that this was achieved on the first attempt in 47 of 49 patients.348 In the two failures, use of the Glidescope video laryngoscope afforded an excellent view of the AEC migrating cephalad, allowing rapid reintubation with a styletted ETT. He pointed out that had the tube exchange been performed blindly, the replacement would have failed, with potentially serious consequences. Others have made similar observations.349, 350 These findings and our personal experiences are consistent with Mort's recommendations.",

The T.T.X. was then grasped with two Magill forceps; the caudal one was used to stabilize the catheter, and the cephalad one was used to withdraw the proximal end out of the mouth. An oral tube was then railroaded over the T.T.X. Cooper described a similar maneuver in a patient in whom oral fiberoptic intubation could not be accomplished, but fiberoptic nasal intubation was achieved.354 He passed an ETVC through the existing nasal tube and removed the latter. The ETVC was then stabilized with caudal Magill forceps and withdrawn through the mouth with the cephalad forceps. Oxygen insufflation was provided through the ETVC, which was then used to thread an oral tube into the trachea.

Using an in vitro model, with three sizes of Sheridan T.T.X. catheters, Dworkin and colleagues measured the inspiratory and expiratory flows resulting from a 50-psi injection as the simulated upper airway resistance, lung compliance, gas flow rate, and injection times were varied.363 The upper airway resistance was determined by the effective tracheal diameter, which they defined as a computed difference between the OD of the T.T.X. and the tracheal diameter. They simulated upper airway obstruction by using various sizes of ETT adapters (11- to 3.5-mm ID) in the proximal airway. The gas flows through the large, medium, and small tube exchangers, when connected to a pressure source of 50 psi, were 63, 33, and 12 L/min, respectively. In their model, if the difference between the tracheal and T.T.X. diameters resulted in an effective tracheal diameter that was greater than 4 to 4.5 mm, air trapping did not occur. Because increased upper airway resistance and reduced effective tracheal diameter resulted in larger tidal volumes, they concluded that jet ventilation through a long catheter that was positioned close to the carina caused little Venturi effect or air entrainment. Placement of the catheter close to the carina may ensure a higher oxygen concentration by reducing room air entrainment, but it also increases the risk of distal catheter migration and barotrauma.",

An alternative approach is to reduce the driving pressure. Gaughan and coworkers assessed the tidal volumes and air entrainment in a model lung with a range of compliance sets ventilated by high- and low-flow regulators through 14- and 16-gauge intravenous catheters.365 Their high-flow regulator at steady state produced flow rates of 320 L/min at 100 psi, whereas the low-flow regulator produced flows up to 15 L/min at 9 to 5 psi. Intravenous catheters, because of their short length, offer considerably less resistance to flow. Their proximity to the upper airway also results in greater air entrainment (15% to 74%). Both high- and low-flow regulators allowed adequate minute ventilation in the setting of normal tracheal and bronchial diameters and normal compliance. The investigators recommended that during transtracheal jet ventilation, when low-flow regulators were used, an inspiratory-to-expiratory (I : E) ratio of 1 : 1 should be used because it yields the greatest minute ventilation. Although this observation is undoubtedly true, it remains to be determined whether such high minute volumes are clinically necessary or safe.343, 361\n",

At any given driving pressure, the more side holes, the lower the pressure at the catheter tip. They recommended vigilance regarding the location of the catheter tip, including avoidance of direct mucosal contact and insertion into orifices where exhalation might be restricted.

Its use to provide jet ventilation during general anesthesia with muscle relaxation on 45 occasions was described.338 Its attachment to a handheld jet ventilator with a pressure-reducing valve is shown in Figure 50-9\n. Between 1991 and 1993, Irish and coworkers used this device with a driving pressure of 50 psi in 25 anesthetized and paralyzed patients undergoing percutaneous dilatational tracheostomies.367 They observed barotrauma in one patient. Arterial blood gases in 12 consecutive, critically ill patients revealed a pH of 7.37 \u00b1 0.09, Paco\n2 of 45.5 \u00b1 10.8, and Pao\n2 of 256 \u00b1 126 (mean \u00b1 SD). In a subsequent report, a patient ventilated for 90 minutes at only 20 psi developed a pneumothorax.343 Chan and Manninen also described use of the ETVC to provide jet ventilation.368 After performing a fiberoptic intubation in a patient with an unstable cervical spine, they discovered that the cuff of the ETT had been damaged. They inserted a flexible bronchoscope through the other nostril and advanced it through the vocal cords anterior to the original ETT. They then passed an ETVC through the original ETT and provided three breaths of jet ventilation at 50 psi. The patient developed a pneumothorax. Unfortunately, they used a high driving pressure through an exchange catheter that might have been too deeply inserted in the setting of near-complete glottic occlusion (i.e., partial cuff deflation, 6-mm ETT, and an FOB passing through the vocal cords).",

It should be immediately available and used when there is evidence of deteriorating oxygenation. If a 15-mm connector is available, capnography should be used to confirm intratracheal placement. An in-line pressure-reducing valve should be used, and ventilation should begin with the lowest pressure capable of producing adequate chest expansion. The duration of inspiration should be minimized while the duration of exhalation is determined by observing the return of the thoracic diameter to its position before inspiratory. The depth of catheter insertion should be far enough from the carina that distal migration does not occur but not so proximal that jet ventilation results in the catheter's ejection from the glottis. Multiple distal side holes can reduce catheter whip and the distal catheter pressure during jet ventilation. Every effort must be taken to minimize expiratory resistance.",

Although respiratory complications are more common at extubation than during intubation, most are relatively minor and do not require reintubation. However, the need for reintubation cannot always be predicted. Reintubation may prove to be difficult and dangerous in a variety of circumstances. The ASA Task Force and the Canadian Airway Focus Group have recommended that each anesthesiologist have a preformulated strategy for extubation of the difficult airway. A risk stratification scheme can be used to identify patients for whom special extubation precautions seem to be warranted. Although many strategies are available, their benefits have not been subjected to rigorous evaluation. A reversible extubation can be performed with a tube exchanger. Use of a stylet does not guarantee that reintubation will succeed. The probability of a successful tube exchange may be enhanced if it can be performed under visual control using direct or indirect laryngoscopy. Carefully used, however, it should enhance patient safety by providing oxygen insufflation and jet ventilation while other avenues are explored.",

Any emergent reintubation is likely to be more complex due to urgent conditions and physiologic instability.\u2022Reintubation may fail because of inadequate access to the airway (e.g., halo fixation, maxillomandibular fixation), preexisting anatomic features (e.g., retrognathism, prominent incisors), inadequate preparation, lack of expertise or insufficient information (e.g., emergencies), a rapidly deteriorating clinical state, or blood, secretions, or swelling obscuring the visual field.\u2022Many threatening circumstances can be anticipated and managed preemptively with an extubation strategy.\u2022Extubation strategies include deep extubation, bronchoscopic examination under anesthesia through a supraglottic airway (SGA), substitution of an endotracheal tube with an SGA, and extubation over a tube exchanger.\u2022The safest extubation strategy may be a surgical airway.\u2022A supraglottic device or tube exchanger should be left in place until it is likely that reintubation will not be required. Premature withdrawal is a common mistake.\u2022A reintubation strategy may include the judicious administration of oxygen by insufflation or jet ventilation; advancement of an endotracheal tube over the tube exchanger, preferably with tongue retraction; or indirect laryngoscopy.\n",
