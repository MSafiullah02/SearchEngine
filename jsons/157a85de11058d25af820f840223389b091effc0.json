            "text": "The ad hoc table retrieval task is concerned with satisfying a query with a ranked list of tables. While there are strong baselines in the literature that exploit learning to rank and semantic matching techniques, there are still a set of hard queries that are difficult for these baseline methods to address. We find that such hard queries are those whose constituting tokens (i.e., terms or entities) are not fully or partially observed in the relevant tables. We focus on proposing a latent factor model to address such hard queries. Our proposed model factorizes the token-table co-occurrence matrix into two low dimensional latent factor matrices that can be used for measuring table and query similarity even if no shared tokens exist between them. We find that the variation of our proposed model that considers keywords provides statistically significant improvement over three strong baselines in terms of NDCG and ERR.",

There have been important work that focus on the automated retrieval and interpretation of data in tabular format. These works range from mining tables from documents [3, 8] to extracting information from within tables [11] and semantic analysis of table content [2, 14] , to name a few. Recently, Zhang and Balog have systematically introduced the task of ad hoc table retrieval from an information retrieval perspective [16] . The idea is to retrieve a ranked list of relevant tables for an input query given a corpus of existing tables. The task shows close resemblance to the traditional ad hoc document retrieval problem while distinguishing itself in that data in tables are quite short, often including a few terms or just numbers, and as such making it challenging to extract the context that is needed to draw relevance conclusions.",

Despite this strong performance, we note that their performance is not satisfactory over hard (difficult) queries. In other words, while these methods perform very well on a subset of queries, they are not equally effective on another subset. This is inline with findings within the ad hoc document retrieval literature that distinguishes the performance of a retrieval method on soft (easy) and hard (difficult) queries [7, 15] . More specifically, when looking at the bottom 20% of the queries ranked based on AP, it is possible to see that in the top-10 results retrieved per query, there are 0 out of 12, 2 out of 12 and 7 out of 12 queries that had retrieved at least one relevant table by WikiTable [1] , Learn To Rank (LTR) and Semantic Table Retrieval (STR) [16] methods, respectively. We observe that methods that are primarily based on keyword-based features for determining relevance do not perform well on hard queries. For instance, as we will show with more details later, for a query such as 'pain medication', the most relevant table based on relevance judgements is one that does not include any of the query terms. Therefore, methods such as STR [16] that leverage semantics perform better on hard queries.",

In this paper, we will present a systematic approach for learning low dimensional latent factor matrices to represent queries and tables based on the co-occurrence of terms and entities within the table corpus. The learnt latent factor matrices allow us to efficiently compute query-table similarities for ranking. We show that the learnt latent representation allow us to, statistically speaking, significantly improve the performance of ad hoc table retrieval on hard queries, which would otherwise not receive appropriate treatment. Our method is specially suited for hard queries, as the learnt latent representations extract transitive relations through observed entity and term co-occurrences, which are appropriate for measuring relevance when query terms are not present in relevant tables.",

Hence, we propose three variations, namely (1) Keyword, (2) Entity, and (3) Keyword + Entity. Within the Keyword variation, the relevance of token i to table t, i.e., R t,i , is defined as: R t,i = 1 if i \u2208 t and 0 otherwise. In the Entity model, R t,i is defined slightly differently because it is possible to determine the relevance of an entity to a table even if the entity is not observed in the table. We define R t,i for the Entity variation as R t,i = 1 if i \u2208 t and wmd(i, t) otherwise. In this case, if the entity is not present in the table, we compute the word mover's distance [9] to compute the similarity of entity i to table t.

Furthermore, given the Sim(., .) function employed in the third regularization term of Eq. 3 is dependent on the baseline, it is necessary to report the findings separately for each baseline. The results are reported in Tables 1, 2  and 3 for STR, LTR and WikiTable methods, respectively. When considering the three baselines and based on the three variations of our proposed approach, it is possible to see that the Keyword variation shows stronger performance compared to both Entity and Keyword+Entity approaches. The reason for the lower performance of the Entity-based variations was related to the sparsity of entities in tables compared to terms. It is more difficult for the latent factor model to identify table similarities based on sparse entity occurrence information. Furthermore, we found that the use of a semantic similarity score in Eq. 5 for cases when the entity was not explicitly observed in the table leads to undesirable derived table similarities . Hence, the performance of the variations that included entity information in our proposed approach is weaker than the variation that only uses terms.",

            "text": "We further observe that regardless of the variation, our approach improves over the baselines except for STR, which was only significantly outperformed using the Keyword variation. We postulate that this is due to the fact that STR already benefits from entity information in their semantic formulation and as such the use of sparse entity information in our model does not lead to observable improvements, while our variation based on Keywords outperforms STR. The other noticeable improvement is observed over ERR and NDCG at 10 for WikiTable. As seen in Table 3 , there are no relevant retrievals at rank 10 by this baseline and hence both ERR@10 and NDCG@10 are reporting zero. However, all three variations of our approach have been able to improve WikiTable by identifying relevant tables for the hard queries at rank 10. Now, in order to analyze the performance of our approach in contrast with the baselines, we select two queries with the highest improvement over NDCG@10 for each baseline and report them in Table 4 . The third column of the table shows the relevance score given to the table for the query in the relevance judgements, the fourth and fifth columns are the table rank produced by the baseline and the Keyword variation of our approach, respectively. For all the relevant tables for each query, our approach has been able to improve the ranking of the relevant table in these queries. We further looked into the characteristics of these tables for possible explanation of the better performance of our approach. We classify the tables into two types, denoted by \u2020 and \u2021 , which represent those tables that either have only a subset of the query tokens mentioned in them, or none of the query tokens mentioned in them, respectively. As seen in Table 4, all tables,  except for Table 1437 -680, are classified as either \u2020 or \u2021 . Given our latent factor model is able to identify implicit relations between tables based on transitively shared tokens, it is able to identify query and table relevance even if the same tokens do not appear in them. For instance, for Query 30: 'Pain Medication', our approach has been able to identify We observe that hard queries for the baselines are those queries which have relevant tables that are classified as \u2020 or \u2021 . However, soft queries are those whose tokens are explicitly observed in the relevant tables. We believe that for such soft queries employing baseline methods that check for explicit query term occurrence would be a better strategy compared to our latent factor model that derive relevance based on transitive token-table occurrence patterns.",
