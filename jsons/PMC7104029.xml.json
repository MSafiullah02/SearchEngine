            "text": "Recently chronic infectious diseases including tuberculosis, hepatitis, filariasis, leishmaniasis, amoebiasis caused by Entamoeba histolytica, as well as acute infectious zoonosis such as malaria, Middle East respiratory syndrome, influenza and Ebola, have been occurred or persisted in various countries, particularly, in less-developed countries globally. Furthermore, the prevalence of tuberculosis has still been causing a serious global challenge of drug-resistant tuberculosis such as extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) and multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) despite various efforts and studies worldwide. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) is one of the major infectious factors causing the highest mortality through the co-infection with HIV/AIDS as well as the most dangerous infectious bacteria causing resistant strain through fast infectivity and the adaptability against environmental variation. Recently, it was estimated that 9.0 million people in the world were confirmed as new tuberculosis cases in 2013, and 1.1 million of them had HIV-positive response. Particularly, tuberculosis cases co-infected with HIV/AIDS showed high-infection rates in the African region compared with other countries, and most of tuberculosis cases in 2013 and 2014 occurred in Asia (56%) and the African region (29%) [1], [2]. In these aspects, various studies for the inhibition and/or the treatment of tuberculosis have been carried out in anti-tuberculosis drug discovery/development field. However, the current anti-tuberculosis drugs not only showed the limit that can't inhibit the increase of the tuberculosis patients, but also caused various side effects. Recently, the global pharmaceutical companies for the development of novel/effective anti-tuberculosis drugs are testing the repurposed compounds such as PA-824, SQ109 and linezolid through chemical remodeling of the existing drugs, as well as newly developed compounds such as Q203, TMC207, pyridomycin, and thiophenes in clinical trials [1], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]. Nevertheless, the rapid emergence of tuberculosis including MDR-TB and XDR-TB is still inducing serious concerns and problems in the public health field worldwide. Recently, various extracts and/or natural products derived from medicinal plants or traditional oriental medicine were studied or reported for discovering novel anti-M. tuberculosis candidate drugs, which are being progressed for developing anti-tuberculosis drugs of more effective/safe next-generation [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13]. Furthermore, various medicinal plants of oriental medicine have been utilized as traditional resources for treating diseases and/or symptoms such as diabetes, arteriosclerosis, hepatitis, parasite, cancer both \u201cin vivo\u201d and \u201cin vitro\u201d [14], [15], [16], [17], [18].",

Particularly, the methanol extract of M. azedarach and n-hexane extract of L. chinensis strongly inhibited the growth of M. tuberculosis compared with other extracts. When M. tuberculosis was incubated with 200 \u03bcg/mL of the methanol extract of M. azedarach, their growth units were detected at about 8.7 days, whereas 400 \u03bcg/mL of the methanol extract strongly inhibited the growth of M. tuberculosis compared with other extracts, and the growth unit of M. tuberculosis was not detected until 28th day. Furthermore, when M. tuberculosis was incubated with 400 \u03bcg/mL of the n-hexane extract of L. chinensis, their growth units were detected at 20.6 days, whereas 800 \u03bcg/mL of the n-hexane extract strongly inhibited the growth of M. tuberculosis, and the growth unit of M. tuberculosis was not detected until 28th day. In this MGIT 960 system assay, the methanol extract of M. azedarach and the n-hexane extract of L. chinensis consistently inhibited the growth of M. tuberculosis for 4 weeks with a single treatment (400 \u03bcg/mL and 800 \u03bcg/mL) respectively, and they showed more effectively the selective anti-M. tuberculosis activity as well as anti-M. tuberculosis action compared with other extracts. In addition, the extracts indicated higher activity against M. tuberculosis H37Ra than M. tuberculosis H37Rv in the MGIT 960 system assay (Figure 2). Particularly, the differences in anti-M. tuberculosis activity of them were obviously confirmed in the MGIT 960 system assay compared with the REMA assay (Table 2). These results demonstrate that the extracts not only induce anti-M. tuberculosis activity causing the inactivation of M. tuberculosis by effectively or consistently inhibiting the growth of M. tuberculosis, but also have unique anti-M. tuberculosis properties that inhibit or block the growth of M. tuberculosis in a concentration-dependent manner.",

            "text": "The recent zoonotic diseases such as Middle East respiratory syndrome, avian influenza and Ebola have been occurred in various countries worldwide through diverse infectious pathways, particularly, in Asia, Middle East and Africa. Furthermore, the serious infectious pathogens such as influenza, M. tuberculosis, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus have strongly enhanced their infectivity and viability through resistance or adaptability to drugs as well as environmental variation for the past decades, which induces serious difficulty to treatment and prevention of the disease as well as the development of the effective drug. In particular, these diseases have caused high risk symptoms to young children whose immune function is low and the elderly who have other underlying diseases or complications compared with normal adults. In this aspect, tuberculosis is a disease to cause infection through droplets, which has been causing high mortality and prevalence rate compared with other contagious diseases worldwide. Tuberculosis was one of the leading causes of death among various infectious diseases in 2013 and 2014 globally, particularly, in Africa [1], [2]. It is the most dangerous infectious disease causing complications such as bronchiectasis, emphysema, and pneumothorax through chronic symptom. In addition, the rapid increase and appearance of XDR-TB/MDR-TB imply an urgent need to develop anti-tuberculosis drugs of effective/safe next-generation for treating tuberculosis. Until recently, despite various efforts to discover and to develop new anti-tuberculosis drugs, the development of effective/safe anti-tuberculosis drugs is still facing with direct or indirect-difficulty including the cost or time as well as the economic aspect and the profitability of pharmaceuticals. Furthermore, the overuse of antibiotics and antibacterial drugs has rapidly increased the prevalence and incidence rate of resistant-tuberculosis such as XDR-TB and MDR-TB, which has caused more difficulty to treat tuberculosis-patients compared with the past. In addition, the current anti-tuberculosis drugs induce various/serious side effects including hepatotoxicity, ototoxicity, and nephrotoxicity. In this aspect, as one of feasible alternatives for overcoming limitations of the drug's side effects, particularly, including rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol and moxifloxacin, various studies for developing anti-tuberculosis drugs were reported from active substances derived from traditional diverse medicinal plants and biological resources [19], [20], [21], [22], [23]. However, anti-tuberculosis agents of effective/safe next-generation that can be utilized or used as potential/novel first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs, particularly, the extracts, natural products, and/or semi-synthetic compounds, have not yet been reported in the global pharmaceutical market.",

Moreover, the plants selected from the existing medicinal plants through new pharmacological action may increase the potential which can be utilized as a useful/feasible resource for developing new substances in a medical field. For these reasons, this study has been focused on major key points for the discovery of new candidate substances as one of different strategies for developing anti-tuberculosis drugs, which has included crucial factors such as the minimization of side effects and the safety of drugs, as well as the finding of novel pharmacological activity and function of the medicinal plants used in Korean traditional medicine. In these aspects, M. azedarach and L. chinensis are medicinal plants that are used as biological resources of traditional oriental medicine in Korea, Japan and China as well as various countries and regions globally, which include various bioactive substances. Until recently, pharmacological activity and function of them have been variously reported as follows: (1) the aqueous extracts from M. azedarach induce the effect of wound healing by activating the growth of keratinocyte [24]; (2) the pediculicidal activity of ethanol extracts of M. azedarach\n[25]; (3) the leaves and bark extracts of M. azedarach through cyclooxygenase-2 and the inducible NO synthase inhibition cause anticancer activity and anti-inflammatory effects [26], [27], [28]; (4) the anti-diabetic activity of ethanol extract of M. azedarach\n[29]; (5) the anti-parasitic effect of hexane extract of M. azedarach against gastrointestinal nematodes [30]; (6) the antibacterial effect and antifungal activity of the extracts of M. azedarach against pathogenic bacterial and fungus strains [31], [32]; (7) the methanol extracts and the compounds isolated from L. chinensis induce anti-oxidant activity and anti-inflammatory effects through the nuclear factor-\u03baB pathways [33], [34]; (8) the anti-viral effects of L. chinensis extracts in mouse model infected by herpes simplex virus type 1 [35]; (9) the anticancer effects of the compounds isolated from L. chinensis against human lung cancer cells [36], [37].",

However, despite the pharmacological activity or actions of them identified through these studies, their anti-tubercular activity have not yet been reported in both \u201cin vitro\u201d and \u201cin vivo\u201d. For this reason, this study has been begun from hypothesis that M. azedarach and L. chinensis may strongly inhibit or block and effectively modulate the growth of M. tuberculosis. As mentioned above, the results of this study showed novel anti-tubercular activity of M. azedarach and L. chinensis extracts by effectively inhibiting the growth of M. tuberculosis through their novel pharmacological activity and properties. Particularly, anti-M. tuberculosis activity and the ability of M. azedarach and L. chinensis extracts were obviously demonstrated through different M. tuberculosis susceptibility-indicator assays such as the REMA and MGIT 960 system assay, and they consistently showed their anti-M. tuberculosis activity by strongly inhibiting the growth of M. tuberculosis for 4 weeks with a single treatment (400 \u03bcg/mL and 800 \u03bcg/mL) in MGIT 960 system assay, respectively. In addition, the specificity and differences in anti-M. tuberculosis activity of them were obviously confirmed in the MGIT 960 system assay compared with the REMA assay, and the methanol extract of M. azedarach more effectively inhibited the growth of M. tuberculosis compared with those of L. chinensis extracts. These results imply that the intracellular signaling-pathways for replication as well as key-proteins for regulating cell cycle in cytoplasm that accelerate the growth of M. tuberculosis and/or functions of the cell wall of M. tuberculosis are strongly inhibited or deactivated by the binding of the extracts. Furthermore, the extracts showed higher anti-M. tuberculosis activity in M. tuberculosis H37Ra than M. tuberculosis H37Rv in the MGIT 960 system assay, and it suggests that these results can be associated with differences in pathogenesis and virulence of the two strains or different pathogenic phenotypes between H37Rv and H37Ra.",
