[1] The most famous members of the poxvirus family are variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox, and vaccinia virus, which shares over 97 % amino acid sequence identity with variola, is used in the variola virus vaccine, and is widely used as a model poxvirus in the laboratory. [2] Smallpox is a devastating, highly transmissible, infectious disease with high morbidity and up to 40 % mortality. Following a global, intensive immunization campaign with the vaccinia virus vaccine, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the worldwide eradication of smallpox in 1980. Three years later, variola virus stocks were either supposedly destroyed or submitted to one of the two WHO-approved laboratories situated at the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta and at the Russian State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology in Novosibirsk. [3] The successful global immunization campaign resulted in a decreased demand for the development of therapies against variola virus because pharmaceutical companies had little interest in developing drugs for a disease that had already been eradicated. However, owing to recent worldwide political developments, variola is nowadays widely regarded as one of the most significant bioterrorist threats. [4] In fact, the CDC has placed variola virus at the top of the high-threat agents list (category A) [5] because the impact of a smallpox pandemic in the human population today would be even more catastrophic than during the last century as a result of the vaccination programs being suspended, mainly because the vaccinia virus vaccines have substantial side effects. [6] Moreover, there is also a natural public threat arising from the emergence of zoonotic poxvirus infections such as the monkeypox virus, a virus that produces a disease in man that closely resembles smallpox, though less frequently fatal. Monkeypox exists naturally in Africa and several cases are reported in the US every year. [7] The bioterrorist threat, the growing concern about zoonotic infections, and the side effects of vaccines have re-established the need for efficient safe therapies for poxvirus infections.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 120, "end": 123, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 405, "end": 408, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 880, "end": 896, "text": "Prevention (CDC)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 995, "end": 998, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1398, "end": 1401, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1499, "end": 1502, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1767, "end": 1770, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2099, "end": 2102, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Recently, several compounds have been identified that inhibit various steps in poxvirus infection, including DNA synthesis and virion morphogenesis.

Several of these compounds display submicromolar activity against vaccinia virus, and were more potent than cidofovir (CDV). The more active compounds were about 10-fold more active than CDV, with minimum cytotoxic concentrations above 100 mm. Chemical manipulations of the two carbon-carbon double bonds present in the compounds were carried out to further explore the structure-activity relationships of these new polycyclic imides. Hydrogenation of the two carbon-carbon double bonds decreases antiviral activity, whereas either cyclopropanation or epoxidation of the double bonds fully eliminates the antiviral activity. ral activity, proving to be effective against many poxviruses and herpesviruses. However, the low oral bioavailability of CDV and potential nephrotoxicity associated with its intravenous administration would be an issue in the case of a bioterrorist attack. Prodrugs of CDV have been prepared that significantly enhance its oral bioavailability. [9] Tecovirimat, a new, potent, orally active antipoxviral agent recently disclosed by SIGA laboratories, features a polycyclic hydrocarbon moiety and an N-benzamido substituent. [10] It targets the F13L protein of vaccinia virus, a membrane component required for the formation of extracellular viral particles. [11] Tecovirimat was shown to inhibit the growth of multiple orthopoxviruses in cell cultures, including two strains of variola virus. In addition, tecovirimat has demonstrated significant antiviral activity in various animal models of the poxvirus disease, including the complete protection of golden-mantled ground squirrels from lethal doses of monkeypox virus and protection of nonhuman primates from variola virus in lesional disease models. [12] The agent demonstrated favorable safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase I ascending-dose study in healthy human volunteers. These and other results support the use of tecovirimat to prevent smallpox disease in nonvaccinated individuals, as a postexposure therapeutic for use in nonsymptomatic individuals exposed to variola virus, as a treatment for confirmed smallpox infection, and as an adjuvant to vaccination with the smallpox vaccine. [13] Recently, it has received both orphan drug designation and fast-track status from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), supporting development of tecovirimat for the prevention and treatment of smallpox infections. [14] SIGA has disclosed structure-activity relationships on ST-246, mainly regarding the effects of the substitution of the aromatic ring. However, few efforts were made with regard to the replacement of the tricyclononene subunit ( Figure 2 ). [15] Results and Discussion For many years, our group has worked on the synthesis of polycyclic hydrocarbon derivatives, mainly from a synthetically oriented point of view.
