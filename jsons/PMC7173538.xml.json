            "text": "Viruses have long been distinguished by their physical features, usually visualized by electron microscopy or analyzed biochemically. One feature that has been frequently used to categorize viruses is the presence or absence of a lipid bilayer. Many animal viruses are surrounded by a lipid bilayer that is acquired when the nucleocapsid buds through cell membranes, usually at a late stage of virus assembly. While the protein coat of nonenveloped viruses plays a crucial role in protecting the genome from the environment, for enveloped viruses the lipid membrane partially fulfills this role. The lipid membranes are decorated with virus-encoded envelope proteins that are important for the subsequent infectivity of the virus, although some viruses also incorporate cellular proteins in their membrane. Virus envelopment can take place after the assembly of an intact nucleocapsid structure (betaretroviruses) or capsid assembly and envelopment can occur concomitantly (orthomyxovirus). Specific or nonspecific interactions between the viral envelope glycoproteins and the proteins that make up the nucleocapsid mediate the envelopment of the core or nucleoprotein\u2013nucleic acid complex. Enveloped viruses acquire their lipid bilayer from a variety of locations within the cell, but a given virus will usually bud from one specific cellular membrane (Table 1\n). Enveloped viruses can take advantage of the cellular secretory pathway in order to assemble and bud out of the cell. In contrast, nonenveloped viruses usually exit infected cells by disrupting the plasma membrane. Thus, budding provides enveloped viruses with a nonlytic method of exiting infected cells, and they must do so while the cell is still alive.",

The viral envelope glycoproteins mediate the interaction of the virus with cell receptors and promote the fusion of the viral and cellular membranes during infection of susceptible cells. Viral glycoproteins are also crucial for the assembly of the virion. They can make important lateral contacts with each other, thus driving oligomerization and also capturing other viral components such as the capsid or matrix protein. The majority of enveloped viruses contain one or more glycoproteins that are usually found as oligomers embedded within the lipid membrane. High-resolution structural information is available for many glycoproteins such as the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins of influenza A virus, the gp120 of HIV, and the E protein of dengue virus.

            "text": "Alphaviruses are members of the family Togaviridae, which also includes the genus Rubivirus. Alphaviruses enter the host cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis via the clathrin-coated endocytic pathway. Following fusion at low pH with the endosomal membrane, the NC is released into the cytoplasm. The NC has been proposed to uncoat by transfer of capsid proteins (CPs) to ribosomes. This releases the genome RNA into the cytoplasm which is translated to produce the nonstructural proteins. The nonstructural proteins transcribe a negative-sense copy of the genome RNA. This RNA serves as template for genomic and subgenomic RNA. The subgenomic RNA, which is synthesized in greater amounts than the genomic RNA, codes for the structural proteins of the virus. CP is found at the N-terminus of the structural polyprotein, followed by proteins PE2 (E3+E2), 6K, and E1. Two hundred and forty copies of CP, E2, and E1 assemble to form the alphavirus virion (Figure 1(a)\n). The transmembrane E1 glycoprotein functions during entry to mediate the fusion of the viral membrane with that of the endosomal membrane, while the transmembrane E2 glycoprotein is responsible for cell receptor binding. E1 and PE2, a precursor of E2 and E3, are processed together as a heterodimer in the ER and Golgi, and are transported to the cell surface in the form of spikes that are each composed of three heterodimers of E1/E2. E3 serves as a chaperone to promote the correct folding of E2, as well as to prevent the premature fusion of E1 in the acidic environment of the late Golgi. The maturation cleavage of PE2 to generate E3 and E2 by a furin-like protease in a late Golgi compartment primes the glycoprotein spike complex for subsequent fusion during virus entry. The function of 6K is unclear but it does promote infectivity of the particle. A single copy of the genome RNA is packaged by 240 copies of the CP to form an icosahedral NC in the cytoplasm of infected cells. The NC interaction with the E1/E2 trimeric spikes at the plasma membrane results in the budding of the mature virus from the cell membrane.",

            "text": "Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and image reconstruction techniques have revolutionized the understanding of the molecular architecture of alphaviruses (Figure 1(a)). Studies with Ross River, Semliki Forest, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, Aura, and Sindbis have shown that these viruses consist of an outer protein layer made up of the glycoproteins E1 and E2 (Figure 1, Figure 1). The membrane spanning regions of these glycoproteins traverse a host-derived lipid bilayer that surrounds the NC of the virus. The CP and glycoprotein layers interact with one another and are arranged symmetrically in a T\n = 4 icosahedral configuration. Fitting of the atomic coordinates of the crystal structures of the ectodomain of E1 and amino acids 106\u2013264 of the CP into the cryo-EM density of Sindbis virus allowed a pseudo-atomic model of the virus to be generated. The fitting of the E1 structure into the cryo-EM density reveals that E1 forms an icosahedral scaffold on the surface of the viral membrane. E1 is positioned almost tangential to the lipid bilayer, whereas E2 has a more radial arrangement. The bulk of E2 lies on top of E1 and caps the fusion peptide, thereby preventing premature fusion with cell membranes. This arrangement of the glycoproteins is in agreement with the function of each protein, where the surface-exposed E2 interacts with cellular receptors and protects E1 until it is required for fusion. The fusion peptide is only exposed when the E1\u2013E2 heterodimer dissociates in the presence of low pH in the endosome. Fitting of amino acids 106\u2013264 of the CP into the cryo-EM density of Sindbis virus showed that each subunit of the projecting pentamers and hexamers (known as capsomeres) observed in the NC layer is made up of the CP protease domain consisting of amino acids 114\u2013264. There is very little interaction between amino acids 114\u2013264 of the CP either within the capsomere or in between capsomeres. Thus, the major contributors to the stability of the NC in the absence of glycoproteins are CP\u2013RNA and RNA\u2013RNA interactions that take place in the RNA\u2013protein layer below the projecting capsomeres.",

            "text": "Alphavirus virions always contain an NC and it is likely that this promotes and is required for budding through direct interactions with the glycoproteins. Thus, the first step in assembly is for the alphavirus CP to specifically recognize and encapsidate the genome RNA to form NCs in the cytoplasm of infected cells (Figure 2\n). The N-terminus of the CP (amino acids 1\u201380, SINV numbering) is largely basic and thought to be involved in charge neutralization of the genome RNA. Amino acids 38\u201355 are conserved uncharged residues that form a coiled-coil alpha-helix (helix I) important in dimerization of the CP during the assembly process. While the process of virus assembly is difficult to study in the complex cellular environment, the development of an in vitro assembly system based on bacterial expression of CP has led to advances in understanding NC assembly. These studies suggest that the initial event of NC assembly is the binding of CP amino acids 81\u2013112 to the encapsidation signal on the genome RNA corresponding to nucleotides 945\u20131076 (SINV numbering) (Figure 2). This interaction exposes a second site on the encapsidation signal where another molecule of CP binds and forms a dimer with the first CP molecule. Amino acids 114\u2013264 constitute the previously mentioned chymotrypsin-like serine protease that autoproteolytically cleaves CP from the nascent structural polyprotein. This region is involved in binding residues from the cytoplasmic domain of E2, thus linking the outer icosahedral glycoprotein shell with the NC across the lipid bilayer (Figure 1(a)).",

Helix I of CP, which is required for core accumulation in infected cells, may be functionally substituted by a GCN4 helix that forms dimeric coiled\u2013coil interactions but not by a GCN4 helix that has a propensity to form trimeric coiled\u2013coil interactions. In addition, helix I acts as a checkpoint in NC assembly whereby incompatible helices prevent the formation of core-like particles (CLPs) in vitro. Furthermore, a portion of CPs in either NCs or CLPs may be cross-linked into dimers by DMS, a lysine specific cross-linker with a 12 \u00c5 cross-linking distance. Cross-linking enabled an assembly deficient helix mutation of CP to assemble into NCs, suggesting that the cross-link can functionally replace the helix interaction.",

            "text": "While assembly of the CP into NCs proceeds in the cytoplasm, the processing and assembly of the glycoproteins occur in the ER and Golgi (Figure 1, Figure 2). The autocatalytic cleavage of the CP reveals a signal sequence on the N-terminus of the newly cleaved structural polyprotein that directs it to the ER (Figure 1(c)). PE2 is translocated into the ER until it reaches a 26-amino-acid stop transfer signal which anchors PE2 in the membrane. The C-terminal 33 residues of E2 then act as a second signal sequence to direct the next protein, 6K (55 amino acids), into the ER. 6K possesses a stop transfer sequence which anchors it in the membrane, and the C-terminus of 6K acts as signal sequence for the translocation of E1. E1 is anchored in the ER membrane by a final stop transfer sequence close to its C-terminus. The release of PE2 and E1 by cellular signalase cleavage allows the formation of PE2-E1 heterodimers in the ER (Figure 2). PE2 and E1 are each glycosylated in all alphaviruses, but the number and location of the modifications vary. In addition to glycosylation, the glycoproteins are palmitoylated in the Golgi apparatus. As the heterodimers are processed and transported through the ER and Golgi, they undergo a series of folding intermediates that are mediated by disulfide exchange and chaperones. Ultimately, they associate to form spikes which are composed of trimers of PE2-E1 dimers (Figure 2).",

In most alphaviruses including Sindbis, E3 is released and not found in the mature virion. The final destination for the spike complexes is the plasma membrane, where the cytoplasmic domain of E2 (cdE2) recruits NCs assembled in the cytoplasm (Figure 2). Structural studies show that cdE2 residues Tyr400 and Leu402 bind into a hydrophobic pocket of the CP. Mutation of Tyr400 negatively impacted virus budding, while protein translation and core accumulation were at wild-type levels.

Flaviviruses enter cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis. The low pH environment of the endosomal membrane triggers the conformational change of the envelope glycoprotein which results in the fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes releasing the genome into the cytoplasm. The viral proteins are translated from the RNA genome as a single polyprotein. Signal sequences and stop transfer sequences result in the translocation of the nascent polyprotein to the ER membrane. The polyprotein is processed by a combination of cellular and viral proteases to produce the mature structural and nonstructural proteins. Genome replication and virion assembly occur in ER membrane-bound vesicles. The structural proteins and the genome bud into the lumen of the ER to form the immature virion which is transported through the secretory pathway.

In contrast to the alphavirus CP which exhibits no membrane association, the flavivirus C protein is anchored to the membrane, at least transiently (Figure 1(d)). However, Rubella virus, the sole member of the genus Rubivirus within the family Togaviridae, has a membrane anchored CP, perhaps indicating a common origin for the Togaviridae and Flaviviridae. prM is a glycoprotein that associates with the E protein and serves as a chaperone to facilitate the proper folding of E. The immature virions that bud into the ER consist of prM-E heterodimers. prM prevents premature fusion from occurring in the acidic environment of the ER and Golgi. Thus, prM has several functions analogous to the E3 glycoprotein of the alphaviruses. Cleavage of prM into pr and M by a furin-like protease triggers the rearrangement of the prM-E heterodimers into E\u2013E homodimers, resulting in a radical change in size and shape required for the formation of the mature virus particle. The E glycoprotein is responsible for host cell receptor binding and for fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. The E glycoprotein is also critical for the assembly of the virion. High-resolution structures of the ectodomains of several flavivirus E proteins are available. The ectodomain is divided into three domains. Domain II constitutes the dimerization domain as it contains most of the intradimeric contacts between E\u2013E homodimers. Domain II also contains the fusion peptide, a glycine-rich hydrophobic sequence that initiates fusion by insertion into the target cell membrane. Domain III comprises the immunoglobulin-like domain responsible for receptor binding. In addition to the dramatic conformational and translational changes that the E protein undergoes during the virion maturation process, it also changes conformation during membrane fusion. The low pH of the endosome during infection triggers a conformational change which results in the formation of E homotrimers. In this arrangement, the fusion peptides are exposed and available to insert into cellular membranes. Interestingly, the structure of the E protein was found to be very similar to the structure of the Semliki Forest virus E1 protein, the fusion protein of the alphaviruses.",

Cryo-EM reconstructions of the virion have shown that in contrast to the alphaviruses, there is no apparent organization to the flavivirus NC. This may be because there is no direct interaction between the C proteins in the core and the glycoproteins in the viral envelope since the E and M proteins do not penetrate below the inner leaflet of the membrane. Furthermore, no NCs have been observed in the cytoplasm of infected cells and attempts to establish an in vitro assembly system analogous to the alphavirus in vitro assembly system have failed. The lack of coordination between the C protein and the viral envelope proteins suggests that the assembly of virions is driven by the lateral interactions of the E and M proteins in the viral envelope and not by the C protein. This is supported by the observation that flavivirus infections result in the production of noninfectious subviral particles which are composed of just the viral envelope (E and M) and the lipid bilayer.

Within these structures the structural proteins are in intimate contact with the genome RNA. The C protein associates with the genome RNA via interactions between the positive charges distributed throughout the protein and the negatively charged phosphate backbone of the RNA. It is not yet clear how the C protein specifically recognizes the genome RNA; unlike for alphaviruses, a packaging signal has not been conclusively identified for flaviviruses. Coupling between genome replication and assembly within the vesicle packets has been proposed as a mechanism to ensure the specific encapsidation of the genome RNA. It has been shown that one or more nonstructural proteins (NS2A and NS3) are involved in genome packaging and NC assembly. The NC lacks a defined icosahedral structure as described above. Therefore, core formation is probably concomitant with the association of the C protein and RNA genome with the viral glycoproteins and budding into the ER lumen, thus giving rise to the immature particle (Figure 3). The immature virion is transported from the ER to the Golgi where the viral glycoproteins are post-translationally modified. The cleavage of the prM protein in the trans-Golgi network triggers the dramatic reorganization of the viral glycoproteins that results in the formation of the mature virion (Figure 3). The mature virion is then released from the host cell by exocytosis.",

The whole range of the cell's machinery including the translation apparatus, polymerases, chaperones, and post-translational modification enzymes are co-opted by viruses in order to replicate the viral components necessary for assembly. Enveloped viruses have evolved to utilize different cellular membranes and cellular compartments for assembly and they take advantage of the secretory pathway to produce their viral glycoproteins. A majority of viruses bud from the plasma membrane (Table 1). This is the case with alphaviruses, where NC assembly occurs in the cytoplasm and the final assembly of the mature virion occurs at the plasma membrane. The high concentration of viral proteins, often concentrated at specific sites allows for the efficient interaction and assembly of virions. In contrast to alphaviruses, NC assembly and glycoprotein assembly is coupled in the flaviviruses and occurs in vesicle packets associated with the ER. Thus, the whole flavivirus virion is transported through the ER and Golgi while in the case of the alphaviruses only the glycoproteins are transported through the secretory pathway. These exit strategies are not unique and thus serve as model systems to study enveloped virus assembly and release.",

Thus, the flavivirus envelope proteins alone are sufficient to drive budding of virus particles and the close coupling of genome replication and the C protein (perhaps mediated by replication proteins and host factors) is required to package the genome into virus particles. A third strategy for budding is exhibited by the retroviruses where capsid assembly has been shown to be sufficient to drive budding of the virus.
