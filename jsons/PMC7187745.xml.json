Herd immunity refers to the protection of populations from these infections and is brought about by the presence of immunity against these infections in individuals present within a community. It represents the balance between an at-risk population and the microorganism. Conceptually, herd immunity is defined by a subpopulation of patients who have acquired active immunity from either previous infection or prophylactic immunization. These patients subsequently confer a degree of protection to the rest of the community by decreasing the burden of disease as well as the carriage of the organism within that population group.(2)",

The effectiveness of herd immunity is dependent on several epidemiological principles which include the following:The disease must carry a substantial health risk.The risk of contracting the disease must be high.The vaccine must be effective.The vaccine must be safe.(2)\n",

The problem with COVID-19 is that not only is it a highly infectious and contagious virus, but it is associated with a mortality of approximately 5.8% (9 April 2020) in confirmed cases.(3) Dense communities are particularly at risk. The crowding together of human beings, coupled with poor socioeconomic conditions, potentially places the African continent at particular risk for COVID-19. Additionally, very few African countries have sufficient and appropriate diagnostic capabilities. WHO has identified 13 top-priority countries in Africa which are at high risk for the spread of COVID-19 infection. South Africa, due to high volumes of international trade and travel, is also included in this list.(3) Furthermore, evidence from China suggests that both health-care resource availability and health-care burden (number of patients presenting with disease) correlate with mortality.(4) In many parts of Africa, including South Africa, the health-care sector is overburdened. This is largely due to infectious diseases such as tuberculosis (TB) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).(5)",

In contrast, the United Kingdom instead opted to limit new infections through gradual restrictions, rather than adopting stringent lock-down measures. Using mathematical modelling, they postulated a strategy with the aim of achieving herd immunity by allowing the disease to run rampant through their population. This strategy is similar to one that is achieved by a national vaccination programme in an attempt to build \u2018herd immunity\u2019. The rationale behind this theory is that by allowing \u2018enough of citizens who are going to get mild illness to become immune\u2019, a national disaster may be averted. Unfortunately, this strategy failed due to the high complication rates, as well as the short incubation period and lethality of COVID-19. The initial UK strategy led to high rates of hospitalization and intensive care unit admissions, thereby straining their current health service capacity beyond breaking point.(6)",

In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days. With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3\u201319), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4\u20133.9).(1) Using a mathematical stochastic transmission dynamic model to multiple publicly available datasets on cases in Wuhan and internationally exported cases from Wuhan, it was estimated that just by introducing travel restrictions, the reproductive number would decline from 2.35 to 1.05 within 1 week.(7) With the aid of this data, many countries around the world have introduced national lockdowns, as well as the concept of social distancing and self-quarantine as appropriate measures to control the spread of COVID-19. The objective of this strategy is to potentially limit the strain on an already-overburdened health-care system \u2013 so-called flattening the curve.(8) South Africa has followed suit with its lock-down measures.",

In addition, upon the release of the national lockdown, there remains a high likelihood of a resurgence of newly diagnosed COVID-19 cases (Figure 1).(8) Most of the available reports to date indicate that children infected with COVID-19 are less symptomatic. Recent data reported from the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention indicated that among the 44,672 confirmed cases of COVID-19, as of 11 February 2020, 416 (0.9%) were aged 0\u201310 years and 549 (1.2%) were aged 11\u201320 years.(9) Furthermore, in a study of 44,672 confirmed COVID-19 cases of adults and children from China, South Korea, Italy and Spain (as on 11 February 2020), a total of 965 (2.2%) deaths were recoded, with only 1 death in the 10\u201319-year age group and no deaths in the 0\u20139-year age group.(9,10) The notable evidence form this data is that the burden of illness for COVID-19 lies predominantly in the patient age groups above the fifth decade of life (Figure 2).(11) The case fatality rate rose sharply with each decade of life above 50 years of age, with patients between the ages of 60 and 69 years having an average case fatality of 2.6%. Patients between the ages of 70 and 79 years had an average case fatality of 8% and patients above the age of 80 years had an average case fatality of 15.8%.(11)",

The median age of the South African population is 27.6 years with an average life expectancy of 64.8 years. Currently, 67% of the population reside within an urban environment.(12) This implies that we have a much younger population compared to countries such as Spain, Italy and England who have reported large numbers of COVID-19 related mortality. In South Africa, a hybrid model could be considered, wherein young children, adolescents and adults under the age of 50 years, without any significant comorbidities, are allowed to return to schools or universities, and for employed adults to return to their places of employment. It is imperative that this should take place in a setting where the country continues to follow all the precautionary measures of testing, surveillance, quarantine of infected individuals, social distancing, hygiene and very close support of the elderly at-risk population. The potential benefit of targeting this approach is that the cohort of the population under 50 years has the lowest case fatality rates for COVID-19. Furthermore, easing the lockdown within this economically productive segment of the population will make a significant impact in mitigating the negative long-term financial impact of COVID-19 on our fragile economy.",

This has the potential to disrupt the natural pattern of the spread of the illness within the population at large. In addition, this young population is less likely to pose a significant burden on the health-care sector as they have a high recovery rate and a very low case fatality rate.(15) A potential limitation to the implementation of this strategy is the unknown effect of COVID-19 on persons living with HIV and TB. However, there are preliminary reports that countries with the widespread use of the BCG vaccine seem to have a lower morbidity and mortality from COVID-19, thus potentially protecting our population.(16)",
