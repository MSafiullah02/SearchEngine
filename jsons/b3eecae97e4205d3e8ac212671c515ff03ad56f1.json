A successful vaccine for the common cold has not yet been developed (Heikkinen and J\u00e4rvinen, 2003) . The common cold primarily affects the nose, pharynx, and sinuses, presenting symptoms often include a blocked or runny nose, fever, headaches, coughing, a sore throat, and sneezing. The common cold is transmitted through air droplets from infected individuals, which are then breathed in or, more commonly, enter the body through the eyes or mouth via the hands after coming into contact with a contaminated surface (Arroll and Kenealy, 2018) . Unlike influenza, there is no antiviral therapy available to eradicate the causative virus (Jefferson and Tyrrell, 2001) . The common cold is usually mild and self-limiting in nature with an average duration of 7-10 days (Arroll and Kenealy, 2018) . The virus penetrates the tissues of the airways, resulting in local inflammation which presents as nasal discharge, sneezing, sore throat, and cough. Children experience between 5 and 7 colds each year, and adults have 2-4 infections each year.

The influenza virus is transmitted similarly to the common cold, via air droplets from infected individuals (Radojicic, 2018) . Individuals will often say that they are experiencing influenza when they are presenting with the common cold, it is important for pharmacists to differentiate between the two and educate patients on the difference.

Expectorants, such as guaifenesin, stimulate the secretion of mucus in the airways and reduce adhesion to improve the efficacy of coughing in clearing mucus.

Sympathomimetics used in these preparations include pseudoephedrine, phenylephrine, and oxymetazoline. Although the quality of the evidence available is poor, decongestants may improve the subjective measures of symptoms. There is insufficient evidence to suggest whether systemic or topical agents provide superior relief (Deckx et al., 2016) .

The presence of allergens implicated in seasonal rhinitis and the duration of the presence of allergens, can differ depending on both the time of year and geographical location. Unlike seasonal allergic rhinitis, those who experience perennial allergic rhinitis may experience symptoms at any time when exposed to allergens such as animal dander, dust mites, or mold spores. Although individuals experiencing allergic rhinitis symptoms have a high degree of presenteeism at work and school, productivity may be reduced when symptoms are present, quality of life is impacted, and the economic burden of allergic rhinitis is estimated to be billions of dollars each year in the United States alone (Crystal-Peters et al., 2000) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1099, "end": 1128, "text": "(Crystal-Peters et al., 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Allergic Rhinitis"}, {"text": "Individuals may present to the pharmacy with symptoms they attribute to the common cold, when they may in fact be experiencing allergies.

A personal and familial medical history may assist in confirmation of differential diagnosis as a personal of familial history of atopy such as allergic rhinitis, asthma, and/or atopic dermatitis (the \"atopic triad\") is often present.
