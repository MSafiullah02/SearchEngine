A better definition of the true incidence of mixed infections in community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections is partly derived from recent advances in available diagnostic methods (eg, molecular biology). Two points still must be determined: whether the presence of a mixed infection is associated with altered outcomes and whether empirical antibiotic selection should be modified to account for potential polymicrobial infections.",

A mixed infection was present in nine patients (8.3% of total cases, 13.2% of the 68 cases with etiologic diagnosis). Conversely, a recent study examined the etiology of CAP in ambulatory patients tested with blood and sputum culture, and serology for M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae found evidence of dual atypical bacterial pneumonia in only 2.1% of total cases and 4.5% of etiologically determined cases among 507 patients [19] .",

Interestingly, patients with mixed infections were less likely to have diabetes as an underlying disease.

Although mortality rates were similar between the two groups, patients with mixed infections had a significantly greater propensity to develop shock, and borderline significance for greater requirement for intensive care unit admission. These findings suggest that infections involving multiple pathogens may present a greater propensity to spread from the lung, thus causing systemic compromise. Other studies have indeed associated mixed infections with more severe pneumonia [25, 29, 30] , although this association did not translate into greater mortality rates. A possible explanation is that associated factors such as age and comorbidities are responsible for the increased severity allocation rather than the presence of multiple pathogens.

The patients were studied for evidence of viral infection using viral culture, serology, and PCR-based assays. In 16 of 35 (45.7%) H. influenzae-associated exacerbations, evidence of an acute viral infection was also found. Rhinovirus, parainfluenza type 3, and influenza A were the most commonly isolated viruses. Dual viral infections were identified in two subjects.

Immunofluorescence, culture, and PCR for viruses were employed. Paired virus and atypical bacteria serology was performed. Blood, sputum, and endotracheal aspirates were cultured for bacteria. Evidence of a polymicrobial infection was found in 13 of 76 (29%) infective episodes. Viruses were involved in 11 of 13 multiple pathogen infections (mostly influenza, parainfluenza, and RSV). Pyogenic bacteria were present in nine of 13 mixed infections (seven with viruses, two with atypical bacteria), whereas Chlamydia was present in three of 13. Wilkinson et al. [44\u2022\u2022] recently performed an interesting study evaluating the interaction between bacterial and rhinoviral infections in COPD exacerbations. The authors prospectively studied 56 COPD exacerbations, obtaining samples for bacterial culture, performing PCR for rhinovirus, testing lung function, and analyzing airway inflammation through cytokine level determinations. A bacterial pathogen, most often H. influenzae, was identified in 69.6% of exacerbations, and rhinovirus was found in 19.6%. The fall in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) associated with exacerbations presenting with colds (taken as a marker of viral infection) and presence of a lower airway bacterial pathogen was greater than with a cold alone or a bacterial pathogen alone (-20.3%, -3.63%, and -3.13%, respectively). Similarly, exacerbation symptoms were more severe in cases with colds and bacterial infections. Most importantly, exacerbations associated with both H. influenzae and rhinovirus documented infection exhibited greater bacterial load and serum interleukin-6 than those without both pathogens. The study suggests a syn-ergistic effect of viral and bacterial infections in COPD exacerbations, because systemic inflammation, exacerbation symptoms, and lung function changes were all more severe when both agents were present.",

Traditionally, it is thought that in healthy, normally sterile lower airways, viruses (notably influenza) may cause epithelial damage, thus predisposing to the development of secondary bacterial infections such as pneumonia. Conversely, the lower airways in COPD are very often chronically colonized by bacterial pathogens. Colonization is by no means a passive process, but is accompanied by chronic airway inflammation that may facilitate subsequent viral infections. COPD may therefore represent an alternative paradigm, whereby long-standing bacterial infection facilitates viral infections.",

On one hand, elderly patients are at risk for gram-negative and anaerobic polymicrobial aspiration pneumonia, and on the other hand are more prone to bacterial superinfections following influenza infection.

In individual patients during influenza epidemics, use of rapid detection techniques such as real-time PCR may allow the use of effective neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir and zanamivir within 36 to 48 hours of symptom onset, thus reducing the emergence of secondary bacterial complications (including pneumonia) by up to 50% [48] . On a larger scale, the known association between influenza and excess mortality for pneumonia underscores the importance of widespread influenza vaccination in eligible patients, as this has been shown to reduce pneumonia hospitalizations and deaths [49] . Important data in exacerbated COPD patients suggest that the presence of a mixed viral-bacterial etiology may be associated with more severe disease and greater inflammation. In this disease, chronic airway bacterial colonization may facilitate subsequent viral infection, rather than vice versa. A need clearly exists for more research work to investigate this association further.",
