            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an emerging zoonotic pathogen with a broad host range. The extent of MERS-CoV in nature can be traced to its adaptable cell entry steps. The virus can bind host-cell carbohydrates as well as proteinaceous receptors. Following receptor interaction, the virus can utilize diverse host proteases for cleavage activation of virus-host cell membrane fusion and subsequent genome delivery. The fusion and genome delivery steps can be completed at variable times and places, either at or near cell surfaces or deep within endosomes. Investigators focusing on the CoVs have developed several methodologies that effectively distinguish these different cell entry pathways. Here we describe these methods, highlighting virus-cell entry factors, entry inhibitors, and viral determinants that specify the cell entry routes. While the specific methods described herein were utilized to reveal MERS-CoV entry pathways, they are equally suited for other CoVs, as well as other protease-dependent viral species.",

The virus was discovered in humans in 2012, and since then there has been over 2,000 laboratory-confirmed cases worldwide, with 35% of infected humans suffering fatal outcomes [7] [8] [9] . Although MERS-CoV zoonotic and human-to-human transmission rates have declined due to general awareness and improved hospital practices, there are continued possibilities for epidemics, and there is a need for preventive vaccines and therapeutic antivirals. Mechanistic insights into human MERS-CoV entry will promote vaccine and antiviral drug developments.",

For several CoV infections, not all of these proteases are required; however, it is possible that each has distinct potential to activate fusion such that a productive infection ensues. There is evidence that particular CoVs have \"preferred\" in vivo entry routes (e.g., MERS-CoV and 229E-CoV prefer plasma membrane entry, while some MHV-CoVs prefer endosome entry [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] , (see Fig. 1 ). Knowledge of these preferred routes, and their relation to virus-induced disease, is necessary to identify virus variants that might have high transmissibility and disease potential, and to recognize the host factors that might be targeted therapeutically such that infections are suppressed at the cell entry stage.",

CoV spike proteins facilitate membrane fusion by transiting from \"extended fusion intermediates\" to \"post-fusion\" conformations. This transition requires interactions between antiparallel helices termed heptad repeat region 1 (HR1) and 2 (HR2) [20, 21] , and can be arrested by exogenous HR2 peptides, which bind to the fusion intermediates. Typically, HR2 peptides do not enter endosomes and therefore only arrest viruses that transition into intermediate conformations extracellularly, i.e., at target cell plasma membranes. However, lipid-conjugated HR2 peptides can bind plasma membranes and endocytose, accumulating in endosomes such that they will arrest intracellular virus-cell membrane fusion. Using a modified Subheading 3.4.2, we tested the efficacy of native vs. lipid-conjugated HR2 on blocking CoV endosomal entry [22] .

Receptor engagement exposes protease cleavage sites (blue stars) on S proteins. If cell surface proteases such as hTMPRSS2 (blue) are present, S proteins are cleaved and viral fusion occurs at or near the plasma membrane. If hTMPRSS2 or similar cell-surface proteases are not present, then MERS-CoV is endocytosed, and can be triggered by endosomal proteases such as cathepsin L (brown) to complete viral entry Protease inhibitor cocktail: 200 \u03bcM Camostat, 20 \u03bcM proprotein convertase inhibitor, 20 \u03bcM E64D in serum-free media.",
