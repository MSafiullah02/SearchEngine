Most of these lives could be saved through more effective and equitable health system interventions, combining prevention, early and accurate diagnosis, and treatment (Walker et al., 2013, Rambaud-Althaus et al., 2015). The main pneumonia burden remains disproportionately concentrated in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa (Walker et al., 2013). Pneumonia deaths are decreasing, but more slowly than for other major causes of mortality, and too slowly to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal ambition of \u201cending preventable child deaths\u201d by 2030 (United Nations, 2018).",

In this predominantly mountainous country, elevation rises from around 100 m in the southern foothills to over 7500 m in the northern Himalayan range, with the capital, Thimphu, standing at 2334 m (Central Intelligence Agency, 2019). The climate varies with the altitude, from tropical in the southern plains to alpine with very cold winters in the North. In Thimphu, the temperature ranges from \u22123 \u00b0C in winter to 22 \u00b0C in summer on average, coinciding with the monsoon that brings precipitations of around 350 mm in July (Climate-data org, 2019).

All the nurses in the PICU and paediatric ward were trained at the beginning of the study by the lead investigator on how to collect these samples. When a child was identified for recruitment but blood had already been collected, no further blood sampling was conducted. However, if another blood analysis was clinically indicated, additional blood was obtained for the specific purpose of the study. Fluid from pleural effusion was collected when clinically indicated. All recruited patients underwent a postero-anterior chest radiography upon admission. Additional information of potential diagnostic interest, such as computed tomography scans, ultrasound, or cerebrospinal fluid investigation available throughout admission, was also collected. Children were clinically managed and discharged as per existing hospital protocols and discretion of the treating paediatricians, and were followed-up by one study investigator in terms of outcome determination.

In brief, readers first judged the quality of the film (uninterpretable or interpretable, the latter stratified as suboptimal or adequate) and then classified findings for all interpretable radiographs. Significant pathology was defined as the presence of consolidation, other infiltrates, and/or pleural effusion. Endpoint radiologically confirmed pneumonia was defined as consolidation, pleural effusion, or both on any hemithorax. Initially, two paediatricians independently interpreted the radiographs. Discordant results were read by a third reader, trained in WHO criteria for interpretation of chest radiographs. An additional external quality control measure was included in the study protocol, whereby a paediatric radiologist would read a random sample of 10% of the chest radiographs. However, as substantial discordance was observed between the two primary readers, all chest radiographs were again independently interpreted by the paediatric radiologist using the WHO criteria. This last reading was accepted as final interpretation for analysis.",

Winter, which is the coldest season in Bhutan, surprisingly showed the lowest number of cases (10.1%); this finding differs from what is commonly seen in other settings, whereby hospitalization of childhood pneumonia tends to peak during the coldest season (Murdoch et al., 2014, Ben-shimol et al., 2015). However, this finding is consistent with those reported by the national sentinel surveillance programme for severe acute respiratory infections, and with the proportion of all-cause paediatric admissions, lower during winter (Royal Centre for Disease Control, 2018).

These microbiological findings coincide more with the etiological profile of pneumonia in children from high-income countries, highlighting the advanced stage of the epidemiologic transition that Bhutan seems to have reached (Omran, 2005, Prayle et al., 2011). The findings from the PERCH study, conducted in seven LMICs with routine use of PCV, are similar (O\u2019Brien et al., 2019). Even in the absence of a deployed PCV in Bhutan (PCV was introduced only in January 2019), the burden of pneumococcal invasive disease appears to be low in children.",

            "text": "The low proportion of confirmed bacterial cases could be explained by several reasons. First, vaccination coverage was high, which is representative of the rest of the country, although the PCV was not in routine use during the recruitment period (WHO, 2016). Second, almost one-third of the children had received antibiotics prior to collection of blood sample, which reduces the yield of blood culture by around 45% (Berkley et al., 2005, Rhodes et al., 2010, Driscoll et al., 2017, O\u2019Brien et al., 2019). Small blood volume is another factor known to compromise the sensitivity of blood culture (Berkley et al., 2005, Bouza et al., 2007, Driscoll et al., 2017). Blood collection is challenging in children, especially in infants. Blood volumes collected for each child were not recorded in this study but, in practice, around 1 mL was dedicated for blood culture in most cases, despite the 2\u20133 mL recommended in the protocol. Nevertheless, these findings confirm the low yield of blood culture in hospitalized children with pneumonia and question both the need of blood culture for uncomplicated cases of pneumonia and using blood culture as the preferred screening tool for invasive bacterial disease in children with pneumonia. Molecular methods have been found to be more sensitive than blood culture to detect pneumococcal invasive disease (Mu\u00f1oz-almagro et al., 2011, Selva et al., 2013, O\u2019Brien et al., 2019). This was not the case in this study.",

However, evidence of the detection of viruses in asymptomatic individuals has raised concern about the clinical significance of these positive findings. Attribution of causality is not straightforward, as viruses can commonly be found both in symptomatic but also asymptomatic individuals (Jartti et al., 2008, Ruuskanen et al., 2011, Rudan et al., 2013, O\u2019Brien et al., 2019). While the causative role of RSV, influenza, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, and bocavirus in childhood pneumonia is well-established, the pathogenic role of other viruses such as rhinovirus is still questioned (Fry et al., 2007, Caracciolo et al., 2008, Ruuskanen et al., 2011, Shi et al., 2017, Jayaweera et al., 2018, O\u2019Brien et al., 2019). Using molecular methods, rhinovirus has been shown to be the most frequent respiratory pathogen isolated in children, and its detection in asymptomatic children is significantly higher than other respiratory viruses (Kusel et al., 2006, Jartti et al., 2008, Ruuskanen et al., 2011). Nevertheless, clinical relevance of rhinovirus has been proven by the association of this virus with respiratory symptoms in children, mainly wheezing (Kusel et al., 2006, Khetsuriani et al., 2007). In our series, 27.5% of the children with rhinovirus presented with wheezing. Infection with coronavirus (Cor229E, CorHKU1, CorNL63, CorOC43) was low in the present study. Similarly, the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) seems to cause a low infection rate in children (World Health Organization, 2020). The reason why coronavirus infection rate in children is low is unknown.",

The contribution of viral-bacterial co-infections is well-acknowledged in the aetiology of childhood pneumonia, particularly the interaction between influenza virus and S. pneumoniae (O\u2019Brien et al., 2000, Kwofie et al., 2012, Brealey et al., 2015).

Respiratory viruses were detected in a considerable number of children, although a clear pathogenic role cannot be established. Together with the relatively low proportion of children presenting a likely bacterial pneumonia \u2013 around a quarter as per positive blood culture and radiological findings \u2013 these findings emphasize the advanced stage of the epidemiologic transition that Bhutan seems to have reached. This study is the first step to better understand the aetiology and clinicopathological characteristics of pneumonia in Bhutanese children. Henceforth, the development of targeted pneumonia interventions and hypothesis-driven research is encouraged to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with this disease. Fostering a robust pneumonia aetiology surveillance in children under five years of age appears important and would allow the assessment of the impact of the recently introduced PCV in reducing the burden of pneumonia.",
