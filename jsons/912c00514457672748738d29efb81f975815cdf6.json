The average incubation period is 2-14 days, and mostly 3-7 days. However, in some patients, this period may be longer. Here, we report a familial cluster of COVID-19 where a 47-year-old woman with long-term use of glucocorticoids did not develop any symptoms within the 14day quarantine period but was confirmed with COVID-19 by tested positive of antibody on day 40 after she left Wuhan. Almost at the same time, her father and sister were diagnosed with COVID-19. The results suggest that the long-term use of glucocorticoids might cause atypical infections, a long incubation period, and extra transmission of COVID-19.",

Due to the high viral contagiousness and transmission during the presymptomatic phase [3, 4] , COVID-19 progressively spread throughout China and has since become a global health issue [5] . In China, Wuhan city, the capital of Hubei province, became the center of a COVID-19 outbreak [6] . In an effort to prevent a COVID-19 epidemic, Wuhan and its surrounding cities in Hubei province were locked down on January 23rd. However, a tremendous number of patients who were still in their incubation period traveled across China before the lockdown date due to Chinese New Year, resulting in the widespread transmission of COVID-19. Hunan province is adjacent to Hubei province. By March 20th, 2020, a total of 1018 confirmed cases had been reported in Hunan, most of which showed familial clustering.",

She has a more than 16-year history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and has been taking oral prednisone (7.5 mg/d) since her diagnosis. She had not taken hydroxychloroquine or other immunosuppressive drugs. On January 10th, 2020, she spent 1 h dancing and singing in a room and one of her partners was later diagnosed with COVID-19. In the following 10 days, she had no contact with any confirmed or suspected patients. She returned to her parents' home in Yiyang on January 20th and after that never went out. Because of the severity of COVID-19, Hunan province carried out a 'level one response to major public health emergencies' on January 23. Therefore, Case 1 was placed under home quarantine and observation for 14 days. During the isolation period, she felt good and had no fever, cough or shortness of breath. Therefore, she was released from quarantine on February 6th. Just a day later, however, Case 1 began to have a mild cough, nasal congestion, and runny nose, but no fever. She paid little attention to her symptoms and did not seek further medical help. These symptoms improved 7 days later. On February 28th, she was admitted to hospital for screening because of her father's (Case 2) diagnosis of COVID-19. Her routine blood examination was abnormal, with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 2.98 * 10^9/L, hemoglobin concentration of 106 g/L, and platelet count of 73 * 10^9/L. Her erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 33 mm/h, which was above normal. IL-6 was normal. The SARS-CoV2 nuclei acid test from nasopharyngeal swabs was negative, but her IgM and IgG antibodies were positive. Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae antibodies were negative. Lung CT ( Fig. 2A, B) showed multiple lesions in both lungs. These results supported the diagnosis of COVID-19. Hence, she was given antiviral treatment, including 0.2 g BID of Abidol orally and 5 million IU of interferon nebulization. Nasopharyngeal swab virus nucleic acid tests were performed again on February 29th and March 3rd, both of which were negative. On March 5th, her lung CT (Fig. 2C, D) worsened, and ground-glass opacity changes were found in the right upper lung. She was given extra piperacillin sodium tazobactam sodium (4.5 TID), and then glycyrrhizin (150 mg QD). Her CT showed improvements and she was discharged on March 9th.",

Three days later, she was taken to a hospital. Laboratory examination showed a WBC of 2.88 * 10^9/L, Creactive protein of 17.06 mg/L, and fibrinogen of 4.27 g/L. Influenza A and B were negative. Lung CT (Fig. 2G) showed multiple patchy highdensity shadows on both lungs. On February 17th and February 20th, the nasopharyngeal swab was negative for SARS-CoV2. After treatment, the symptoms disappeared. Hence, she was discharged on February 21st and placed under home quarantine. Since her father (Case 2) was diagnosed with COVID-19 on February 28th, she was admitted to the hospital again for further screening. This time, her SARS-CoV2 nucleic acids and specific IgG and IgM antibodies were positive. The ESR was 55.6 mm/h. Antiviral therapy was given with interferon and lopinavirritonavir. On March 2nd, her repeat viral nucleic acid test was still positive. The nasopharyngeal swab was negative twice, respectively on March 4th and March 6th, with simultaneously improved lung CT (Fig. 2H ).",

Unfortunately, COVID-19 patients can be infective before the disease onset and maintain infective ability during the convalescent phase [3, 4, 14] . According to Cao's report [15] , the shortest observed duration of viral shedding was 8 days, whereas the longest was 37 days. However, to date, no article has reported what kind of patients have a longer viral shedding time. In the family we report here, the index patient, Case 1, was from Wuhan and had contact with COVID-19 patients before she returned to Yiyang city. The other 4 family members were from Yiyang and had never left Yiyang, nor did they have contact with any other COVID-19 patients. It is most likely that Case 1 was the infective source in this family. By further examining their epidemiological data, we find that the incubation period of COVID-19 and the shedding duration of SARS-CoV2 might be extremely long in this case. The index patient did not develop atypical symptoms (including a mild cough and a runny nose) until 28 days after she had returned from Wuhan. Remarkably, Case 1 was immunocompromised due to her long-term use of oral prednisone, which might explain why she did not develop typical symptoms at first and why she had a longer duration of viral shedding.",
