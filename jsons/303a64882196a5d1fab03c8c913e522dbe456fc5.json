It is beyond the scope of this paper to describe the detailed working of a hospital crisis committee or regional crisis coordination. However, the authors would like to share a few experiences specific to the pandemic. One particularity of any exceptional situation (mass casualty, pandemic, etc.) is the activation of a structured crisis mode during which authority lies within the crisis committee, relying on a chain of command and clearly defined principles of control. The particularity of the pandemic situation is its unknown duration casting uncertainties for how long the hospital will function in crisis mode. The imperatives of the situation imposed a complete overhaul of the entire hospital organigram and structure within days. The principle of a chain of command is not in the DNA of the medical community in general and some of its members may struggle to adapt to it. In consequence, the committee should anticipate and mitigate the possible challenges that a prolonged crisis mode may signify for the pre-crisis hospital mentality hierarchy and the change in leadership it embodies.",

            "text": "The ethical and logistical challenges of Triage and allocation of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) resources during a pandemic have been extensively discussed (2) . In many places, the overall context enforced clinicians to adapt triage to a prioritisation in alignment with available resources (resource-based triage). In the vast majority the decisions made remained individualised and patient-and contextdependant according to national guidelines (3). In all circumstances, even if increasingly limited resources impose ever more restrictive prioritisation (4), withdrawal or withholding of Critical Care must remain a shared and documented decision-making process. Maintaining this level of accountability is imperative. A detailed and thorough analysis of the withholding and withdrawal of care during the peak of this first wave should be a research priority. scale of this flow model is not measured in hours but days, compared to classic MC events. Application of this doctrine requires keeping length of stay in each zone to a minimum and thinking about the potential discharge pathway on admission to the ICU. Anticipation to increase capacities and to adapt or innovate pathways for recovery and rehabilitation are as important as for acute care. In the ICU, treatment strategies were adapted to implement an \"ICU damage control pathway\". In this context, damage control is to be understood as an acceptable simplification or modification of existing treatment modalities to shorten length of stay (use of high-flow oxygen instead of intubation, keeping sedation and muscle relaxation to a minimum, prone positioning without muscle relaxation\u2026) and avoiding iatrogenesis for the individual patient allowing to treat more patients, instead of attempting implementation of a sophisticated new strategy, less often proved to be more. The capacity of clinicians to absorb new and complex information is limited if their cognitive load is already high. In such contexts, it appears easier to readapt the existing strategy than to reinvent or adopt a completely new or less known strategy (e.g. complex forms of ventilation). patients and balance these with the capacities required for SARS-CoV-2 patients. ICU/HDU capacities management required conscious effort to preserve protected space for non-SARS-CoV-2 critical care and respond to the evolving situation. Even with confinement, the need for major trauma care never fully ebbed down.",

From the current perspective, vital essential services were maintained in the worst affected areas. This preliminary impression requires thorough analysis, based for example on registry data.
