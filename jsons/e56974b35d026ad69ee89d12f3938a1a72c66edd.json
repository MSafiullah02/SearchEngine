Currently no treatment or vaccine has been produced which has led many researchers to look for approaches that can reduce the number of severe COVID-19 cases and consequently reduce the mortality rate of the disease. Time series analysis of the number of confirmed, deceased and recovered cases illuminates patterns of how COVID-19 has impacted different populations, which may help us to better understand the defense mechanisms of the immune system against COVID-19 and develop effective treatments for the viral infection. Italy and Spain have reported a substantially higher crude death rate than other countries [1, 2] despite presenting a higher ranking in overall health care system performance [3] . Some experts have suggested analysis of age-specific case fatality ratio (CFR) and time-delayed adjusted mortality ratio for a more informative study of COVID-19 infection [4, 5] . Initial reports and data obtained from various studies suggest that the elderly (age \u226570 yo) have disproportionately been impacted by COVID-19. The substantially higher CFR of the elderly population compels an age-specific analysis of COVID-19 data. Protection against viral infections is provided by the innate immune system and adaptive immune system. Many individuals have died due to complications from some of the main risk factors for COVID-19 such as ARDS, pneumonia, acute kidney failure, acute heart failure, and rhabdomyolysis.",

The innate (in very young populations) and adaptive (elderly populations) immune system plays an important role in regulating cytokine levels in viral infections. The impact of Vit D in enhancing immune response (including flu and previous coronaviruses) has widely been studied and firmly established [7] [8] [9] . Vit D can also suppress cytokine storm, which may substantially increase the chances of avoiding a severe case of COVID-19 [10, 11] . Some researchers have suggested a potential association between Vit D and CFR during the 1918-1919 viral influenza pandemic, also through suppression of cytokine storm [12] . To the best of our knowledge, no randomized blinded experiment has yet reported Vit D status and cytokine levels in patients with COVID-19. C-reactive proteins (CRP) are substances produced by the kidneys when the body is trying to fix damage to arteries, cells, and tissue from autoimmunity, infection, and other causes [13] . CRP could be used as a nonspecific marker to indirectly measure the severity of a cytokine storm during a severe COVID-19 case. In this article, we have used the reported patient-level data on the association between Vit D and CRP [14] to model and predict the potential impact of Vit D supplementation in the management and alleviation of cytokine storm (estimated by patient-level CRP data) which may lead to the reduction of severe COVID-19 cases. Country-level statistics on Vit D deficiency, COVID-19 mortality, age-adjusted CFR and other demographic variables have been investigated and discussed.",

The ratio of confirmed cases to tested cases for each country (shown in Figure 4 (a)) indicates that Italy and Spain have a substantially higher ratio of confirmed cases from testing (> 4.5 times higher than Germany). This suggests that the actual number of patients with COVID-19 in those countries is greatly higher than the reported figures. The majority of undetected COVID-19 patients in those countries should thus be younger people who display mild symptoms. This could be a reason for the notably higher ratio of confirmed elderly patients with COVID-19 in Italy and Spain compared to other countries, since the age distribution of the countries (shown in Figure 4 (b)) cannot fully explain the reported numbers. In addition, the large number of patients with COVID-19 and the highly contagious nature of the virus make it less likely for the virus to target a specific age group in those countries. ",

The results presented here demonstrate a pattern containing two peaks (one in very young patients and one in the elderly population). We hypothesis that cytokine storm and immunosuppression is a major reason for the admission of patients to ICU [24] . A cytokine storm might have been activated by the innate immune system in the very young population (< 4 yo) while the adaptive immune system could have produced the cytokine storm in the elderly (highlighted in red in the picture). A substantially higher number of elderly patients (age > 60 yo) admitted to the hospital ( Figure 5 (a)), and the notably higher ratio of deceased patients in the population ( Figure 5 (d)) suggests the potential importance of management of the adaptive immune system in patients with COVID-19. These results suggest the aberrant responses of the innate immune system in the elderly population may lead to cytokine storms which causes them to be admitted to the ICU at a higher ratio. The higher ratio of deceased to admitted to ICU patients in the elderly population (age \u2265 70) suggests the threshold for severe consequences of cytokine storm is substantially lower for them after aging. The high ratio of children (age < 4 yo) admitted to the ICU might also be linked to the interaction of their innate immune system with COVID-19. The very low ratio of deceased to admitted to ICU patients suggest a high threshold against the consequence of this battle among them. i t z e r l a n d I r a n F r a n c e U n i t e d K i n g d o m I t a l y S p a i n",

Korea, China, Switzerland, Iran, France, United Kingdom, Italy, and Spain has been evaluated in different studies by measuring mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) concentration, and the results are shown in Figure 6 . The figure shows that Italy, Spain, and France are the three countries with a mean 25OHD concentration smaller than the threshold defined for severe Vit D deficiency. Italy, with a reported mean 25OHD concentration of 19.9 and Spain, with reported 25OHD concentration of 22.5, have presented the highest mortality rates despite having a better health system performance ranking. These nations' age distribution (shown in the supplementary material) does not justify such a trend. Evaluation of the age distribution of the confirmed patients would suggest that Italy and Spain present a higher mortality rate than South Korea, Iran, and China, however, it does not fully explain the current gap. For example, the death rate (number of dead/number of the confirmed patients on the same day) among patients aged > 80 in Italy (26%) is substantially higher than in South Korea (17%). In addition, the age distribution variation within confirmed patients in European countries cannot explain the gap between Italy/Spain and Germany, Switzerland, France, and the UK. More importantly, the case fatality is substantially higher in Italy and Spain even if considering specifically at the elderly (age-adjusted CFR shown in Figure 2 ). This led us to further investigate the impact of severe Vit D deficiency on the increase in mortality rate. Figure 6 -Vit D status is compared via the mean concentration of 25OHD in each country. The data is obtained from independent studies in each country [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . Age distribution of the countries are illustrated in the inset at the top right [16] .",

A key issue is that these countries have not all used the same screening policy. As a result, countries that do relatively little testing tend not to detect mild disease but do show a similar rate of severe disease detection, since severe cases are eventually tested as symptoms worsen. Thus, low-testing countries would exhibit a higher fatality rate. The large ratio of confirmed cases at age > 70 in countries with more restrict screening policies such as France, Spain and Italy compared to the countries with less restrict screening policy suggests that mild undetected diseases are more likely to be a part of the younger population. This suggests the impact of screening policy for comparison of the CFR for the elderly (age \u2265 70) is less sensitive than the impact of screening policy on the crude mortality rate.",

Patients with these conditions are treated with ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II type-I receptor blockers (ARBs) which increase the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) which can lead to severe infection with COVID-19 [35] . Variation in ACE2 expression may play an important role in growth rate and severity of COVID-19 [36] . The genetic mechanisms underlying hypertension and its association via ACE2 expression to Vit D has been widely investigated [37] [38] [39] . Hypertension in severe COVID-19 patients is characterized by an activated renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the lungs. Vit D neuroprotective mechanisms during hypertension through the ACE2/Ang(1-7)/MasR pathway helps to reduce the risk of RAS [7] . Intensive study of over 11,321 participants has demonstrated the impact of Vit D on lowering the risk of RAS [40] . Trigger of RAS through Vit D deficiency [41] reduces lung efficiency by the development of fibrosis over time [42] . This suggests that patients in Italy and Spain with severe Vit D deficiency may be at higher risk of severe COVID-19.",

Analysis of the reported data (without any adjustment of the demographic variables) is shown in Figure 8 and suggests an odds ratio of 2 and risk factor of 1.4 for a high CRP plasma in subjects with severely deficient Vit D (25OHD < 25 ng/l). This means that subjects with a severe deficiency of Vit D have 1.4 times higher risk for production of high CRP.

The aberrant responses of the innate immune system in the elderly (compare to the younger patients) may increase the risk of the viral load [48] which intensifies the activation of the adaptive immune system and production of cytokine storm among this population. This cytokine storm (reported in COVID-19 patients [49] ) brings complications such as ARDS, exacerbation of the effects of pneumonia, acute kidney failure, acute heart failure, and rhabdomyolysis [14] that in some cases becomes fatal. In addition, a weaker cytokine storm among the elderly population can be more fatal (than in the younger population) as the threshold for severe consequences of lung damage is substantially lower for them after aging. Even moderate lung damage due to cytokine storm may lead to hypoxemia that in turn results in mortality due to underlying complications such as CVD.",

The possible role of ibuprofen in worsening COVID-19 treatment [51] can be explained by its action on suppression of innate immunity [52, 53] which leads to overactivation of the adaptive immune system that may intensify the cytokine storm and become fatal in elderly patients [54, 55] . Vit D, on the other hand, may help by boosting the innate immunity (to reduce the viral load) and by suppressing the adaptive immune system (which may further reduce cytokine storm) [8, 9] . The role of Vit D in regulating immunity [8, 9] and reduction of cytokine storm may avoid the complications caused by a cytokine storm in the elderly population.",

The increased viral load causes overactivation of adaptive immune system that produces a cytokine storm. Patient-level CRP data were used as a surrogate marker of cytokine storm and its link and association with Vit D status was used to suggest a potential link between Vit D severe deficiency and the number severe COVID-19 cases. Our analysis suggested a 15% reduction in the number of severe COVID-19 cases given a normal Vit D status within a population. With the availability of data showing a direct link between Vit D status and specific markers of cytokines, a more accurate estimation could be estimated.",

A notably different age-adjusted CFR is partially due to different screening and admission policies in different countries. For example, in South Korea and Germany a higher number of patients with mild symptoms are admitted. Italy and Spain have a substantially higher ratio of confirmed patients with age \u2265 70 yo. This suggests these countries are missing a large number of young patients with mild symptoms and could be the reason for their notably higher mortality rate among their confirmed patients compare to Germany, South Korea, and China. However, these idiosyncrasies (in screening strategies) do not fully explain the phenomenon. A substantially higher age-adjusted CFR (age \u2265 70 yo) is observed in Italy, Spain, and France (countries with more severe Vit D deficiency) than Germany, South Korea, and China (Countries with less severe Vit D deficiency). Adjustment of screening method (same ratio of confirmed/tested cases) for countries with similar screening methods (US, France, Iran, Switzerland, UK, and Italy) shows France (Country with the most severe Vit D deficiency) has reported the highest mortality rate. The statistics available at country level suggests patients' adaptive immune system may have been responding differently among the patients at different age group and also among the population (countries) with severe Vit D deficiency.",
