Currently, there are several open access Twitter datasets, but none of them is dedicated to the institutional and news media Twitter data collection. To fill this blank, we retrieved data from 69 institutional/news media Twitter accounts, 17 of them were related to government and international organizations, 52 of them were news media across North America, Europe and Asia. We believe our open access data can provide researchers more availability to conduct social science research.",
