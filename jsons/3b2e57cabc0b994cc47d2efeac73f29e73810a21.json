Major steps are taken by various governments across the globe, and the most critical steps are imposing lockdowns on countries. With varied implementation of lockdown, there have been some outbreaks, including in Italy and Spain and this work consists of the analysis and prediction of such measures. Similar measures have been taken in India to minimize social contacts, including the shut-down of various organizations, lockdown of schools and colleges, Junta Curfew, and a 21-day lockdown. Since these measures have immense pressure on economy and is important for containing the Coronavirus, quantitative estimates are imperative to learn the impact of spread which will help in planning policies. Given the paucity of such quantitative estimates, the predictions given in this paper becomes critical and to know when the changes are required. This paper consists of evaluating these metrics and thereby come up with quantitative estimates using customized Susceptible-Infected -Recovered (SIR)",

Neural Networks end up overfitting the data, and polynomial fitting using a third-degree polynomial is also found to be overfitting with a very high bias [3] . This is because the trend in the epidemic spread assumes different nature in different phases overtime. A polynomial fit will give an appropriate result for an instance, but as soon as the society relaxes lockdown or changes social-contact pattern in any way, these model cause a lot of deviations. A more appropriate method is found out to be an analytical solution to the differential system of equations using a three-compartment system SIR model described below.",

But this increases as the number of infections goes up, this can go up to 10% and in a country having a population of 134 crore, 10% death rate phase has to be avoided at any cost. Figure 6 shows the death rate in Italy over the time, which shoots up as soon as Italy crosses a figure of 12,000 COVID 19 patients. The death rate reaches as high as 10% and is dependent on the percentage of the elderly people and number of beds per 1000 citizens. The number of beds per 1000 people in Italy is 3.18 while it is around 0.55 in India. The total number of beds available in India is around 7 Lakhs, which is one seventh of Italy. The percentage of people over 60 years is 23% in Italy whereas in India, it is around 8%. It is safe to assume a death rate of 8% when the number of patients overwhelms as the mortality of COVID 19 is less about the disease and more about the health care system and mass of patients. Threshold for the spike in death rate which is 12,000 patients in Italy, this is estimated to be 84,000 patients in India, based on the analysis of data, for such spike in death rate, and this spike can very well be between 7% -10% based on the data provided.",

The number of reported cases kept on rising after the halt of increase in actual cases after lockdown and this shows the influence of incubation period. These cases were majorly the ones who were infected before the lockdown in India and their incubation period continued after lockdown. As expected, the two parameter meets when there is no new cases and the pandemic is contained.

This was learned by making a custom loss function which was minimized by using gradient descent on the loss function. \u03b2 = 0.3536 was observed when the curfew wasn't imposed, and \u03b2 = 0.2627 was observed under the lockdown conditions. This signifies the lockdown period caused a considerable impact in the spread of corona virus. Forecasting was done to find out whether the lockdown was able to prevent or halt the growth of COVID 19. Using these learned parameters the forecast for India is presented in Figures 4 which spans the entire lock-down period in India. The model predicts that the number of active cases will go from 568 to 6424 in 21 days. Model suggests that, an increase of 947 new confirmed cases is predicted in week one, week 2 with 1604 new cases following 3310 new cases in week 3.
