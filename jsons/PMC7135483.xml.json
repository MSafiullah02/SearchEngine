Fifty percent of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) died.2, 3, 8 Laboratory-acquired cases resulted in transmission to family contacts.2 A few patients were \u201csuperspreaders\u201d of the virus.3 In 1 hospital, exposure to a single patient resulted in infection in 138 patients and HCWs.9 Two hundred fifty-two cases were reported in Canada (February 23 to June 12, 2003) and 29 cases were reported in the United States (February 24 to July 13, 2003).1, 3\n",

The epidemic strains (including SARS-Urbani) evolved because of civet-human interaction in Chinese animal markets.14 Serologic evidence of natural SL-CoV infection is also found in the Chinese ferret-badger (Melogale moschata).
