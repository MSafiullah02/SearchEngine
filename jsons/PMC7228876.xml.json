It should be noted that around 85% of patients presenting a brief psychotic disorder will develop a potentially disabling serious psychotic illness in the long-term (Kingston et al., 2013). This case represents the potentially serious mental health consequences on healthcare professionals throughout the COVID-19 crisis, which may present an increased risk for mental health consequences compared to the general population, and emphasizes the need to implement urgent measures to preserve staff mental health during the current pandemic. However, mental health-centered support strategies in such extraordinary settings are often overlooked and poorly coordinated, with controversies on the most effective approach (Chen et al., 2020). Addressing the priority of mental health in the general population as well as in healthcare professionals is essential in addition to the infection medical care. Trained staff should identify healthcare professionals at-risk to develop psychiatric symptomatology and timely refer them to specialists for diagnosis and intervention (Pfefferbaum and North, 2020). Healthcare working teams should be reinforced providing regular contact to discuss decisions and, once the crisis begins to recede, active monitoring, support, and, if necessary, evidence-based treatments should be provided (Greenberg et al., 2020).",

Even more, people with pre-existing mental health disorders are particularly vulnerable to the stressful situations derived from the pandemic outbreak and the confinement situation, which may result in relapses or worsening of psychiatric pre-existing conditions leading to hospitalization (Vieta et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2020), requiring individualized treatment (Anmella et al., 2020). These populations should not be overlooked, and mental health home hospitalization care has been proposed as an alternative to address this problem (Garriga et al., 2020). Additionally, not only healthcare workers, but also other types of workers who are at increased risk of COVID-19 infection through their work, usually from being in close proximity to members of the public, should not be disregarded as they may share some of the stressors leading to severe mental illness and potential psychiatric repercussions as in the exposed case (Sim, 2020). There is an urgent need to monitor mental health and the ongoing onset and persistence of psychiatric symptoms in different populations, to understand the unmet needs and allocate resources for suitable and specific interventions (Arango, 2020).",
