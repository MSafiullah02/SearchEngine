            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus with an approximate 15.4-kb genome, belongs to the genus Betaarterivirus of the family Arteriviridae (ICTV 2018). In pigs, PRRSV causes porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), which is characterized by reproductive failure in breeding sows and severe respiratory distress in young and growing pigs [1]. PRRS results in colossal economic losses in the swine industry worldwide, and these losses are still observed three decades after its emergence in the United States and Europe. After the exposure of pigs to PRRSV, the virus replicates in alveolar macrophages (AM) and further spreads rapidly throughout the body via a lymphohematic route. This viral spread results in acute infection characterized by viremia that lasts for approximately 1 month [2], and a few studies have reported a nonviremic persistent infection of secondary lymphoid tissues lasting for approximately 150 days or longer [3]. In general, the viremia peaks at approximately 7\u201310 days post-infection (dpi) and is almost cleared by 28 dpi depending on the viral strain and age of the pigs [4, 5]. Additionally, the immune response against PRRSV depends on the strain, but the virus usually has immunosuppressive properties [4, 5], which leads to the increased susceptibility of pigs to secondary microbial infections [6]. The interactions between PRRSV and host immune responses have been widely studied, but most studies investigated systemic immune responses using PBMC and/or serum [7]. Previous studies have shown that interstitial pneumonia constitutes the major lung lesions in PRRSV-infected pigs and that significantly decreased numbers of alveolar macrophages are found in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and lung parenchyma samples from PRRSV-infected pigs [8]. However, to the best of our knowledge, the kinetics of local immune responses in the lungs or lymph nodes during the course of infection compared with those of peripheral immune responses have not been previously studied. This information would provide a more in-depth understanding of the sequential activation of both immune compartments and the correlation between local or peripheral immune responses and virus clearance in infected pigs. As a result, achieving a comprehensive understanding of the immune responses against PRRSV infection remains an important goal in PRRSV research.",

            "text": "During PRRSV infection, the pig immune system is capable of escalating an immune response to ultimately clear the virus from the body [9]. For clearance, proper stimulation of the pig innate immune system is required to direct the development of protective adaptive immunity against PRRSV. Interestingly, the preferential sites for PRRSV replication are alveolar macrophages present in the lungs, which form the major component of the respiratory DC/macrophage network. This network is predominantly involved in sensing foreign antigens, controlling inflammation, and initiating the adaptive immune response [10]. Different DC subsets with specific functional specializations exist in the respiratory DC/macrophage network in the lungs and are reportedly resistant to PRRSV infection [8, 11]. However, upon activation, these DC travel to lymphoid tissues to present antigen to T lymphocytes and thereby serve as the link between innate and adaptive immunity [10, 11]. T cells, in turn, play a critical role in the development of anti-PRRSV immunity due to their cytotoxic effector functions in clearing infected cells from the body and developing and regulating antigen-specific immune responses [12]. However, whether the peripheral virus-specific immune response is appropriately correlated with the local immune response during infection, which could result in the precise use of the peripheral response as a surrogate for scrutinizing the local immune response during viral clearance, remains unclear. Therefore, discerning the local and peripheral immune responses during PRRSV infection is important for understanding the basic mechanism of viral clearance from the host.",

In porcine respiratory diseases, proinflammatory cytokines play a key role in activating and synchronizing the adaptive immune responses to clear the virus from the body [13]. However, the tissue damage caused by excessive production of these cytokines is controlled by the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines, which results in the maintenance of homeostasis in the body [14]. Moreover, effective instigation of the local inflammatory response in the lungs accompanied by significant changes in the proinflammatory cytokine levels in serum has been observed in pigs with respiratory diseases [15, 16]. Nevertheless, whether the local or the systemic cytokine/chemokine response plays the primary role in the clearance of PRRSV from pigs during the acute phase of infection remains unclear.",

The results reveal that interferon-\u03b1 (IFN-\u03b1) was significantly (p \u2264 0.05) induced in the sera and BALF of the infected pigs at 3 dpc. However, at peak viremia (10 dpc), the IFN-\u03b1 level was reduced peripherally in the sera of the infected pigs, whereas the cytokine level was elevated locally in the BALF. Nevertheless, significant increases in the level of this cytokine (p \u2264 0.05) were maintained both locally and systemically in the infected pigs compared with the uninfected pigs. Furthermore, proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines, such as tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), IL-6, IL-8 and IL-12, show a similar pattern of early induction at 3 dpc in the sera of the infected pigs followed by decreases as viremia increased. In the sera, significant (p \u2264 0.05) changes in IL-1\u03b2 were only observed in the infected pigs at 3 and 28 dpc. However, significant (p \u2264 0.05) induction of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 locally in the BALF was observed in the infected pigs at 3 dpc. In addition, elevations in all the proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine levels were observed in the infected pigs as the viral load increased, and significant increases in the levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-12 were observed in the infected pigs compared with the uninfected pigs at 10 dpc. Moreover, IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, was significantly induced (p \u2264 0.05) at 3 and 10 dpc in the BALF of the infected pigs. Overall, the clearance of the virus from the pigs also coincided with the increased secretion of anti-viral and proinflammatory cytokines locally in the BALF of PRRSV-infected pigs, although no considerable shifts were detected in the serum.",

Previous studies have mainly focused on certain aspects of immune responses and/or have used a narrow time window to study the immune responses during PRRSV infection; therefore, the available data offer a limited picture of the host defence system. To the best of our knowledge, the present study constitutes the first investigation of various aspects of immune responses, such as local vs. systemic and innate vs adaptive, during the course of PRRSV infection to obtain a broader picture of the host defence against PRRSV. Here, we demonstrate the critical role of local immune responses in the clearance of PRRSV from pigs due to the early induction of DC/macrophage subsets, the activation of protective T cells in local lymphoid and lung tissues, and the stimulation of proinflammatory cytokines locally in the lungs.",

In general, the potential roles of NK cells in relation to PRRSV immunity are poorly understood [43, 44]. In the current study, two defined NK cell subpopulations were distinguished in PBMC based on an approach similar to one previously described [25]. Similar to previous observations, the NKp46+ NK cell frequency in PBMC collected from both control and infected pigs was lower than that of NKp46\u2212 cells. NKp46+ and the NKp46\u2212 NK cells execute analogous cytolytic activities but produce different levels of IFN-\u03b3, with NKp46+ NK cells producing higher amounts of IFN-\u03b3. Moreover, NKp46 can be expressed in NKp46\u2212 NK cells after stimulation with interleukins (IL)-2, IL-12 and IL-18 [25]. In the current study, early increases in the frequencies of NKp46+ and NKp46\u2212 NK cells in PRRSV-JA142-challenged pigs were clearly detected. Previous studies have shown similar increases in the CD3\u2212CD4\u2212CD8+ cell population after infection with different strains of PRRSV [7, 45]. Induced proliferation of NK cells has also been perceived after influenza infection, suggesting that this subset of lymphocytes is capable of antigen-specific clonal expansion [46]. PRRSV, however, significantly suppresses NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity to evade the host immune response [45], but these previous studies did not consider the subsets of NK cells. The specific action of different subsets of NK cells on PRRSV has not yet been explored, and further studies are needed to explain the role of NK cells in the containment of the virus during infection.",

            "text": "The main targets of PRRSV are cells belonging to the monocyte and macrophage lineages, particularly AM. However, DC are also reportedly vulnerable to PRRSV infection [47]. The DC/macrophage network, which senses the foreign antigen and initiates the immune response, constitutes one of the main components of the respiratory immune system [10]. It is plausible to expect that the viral infection of these cells alters this network and thus affects downstream immune responses. Therefore, dissecting how these immune cells respond to PRRSV infection is important to better understand the nature of PRRS. Until now, limited studies have investigated the alterations in the respiratory DC/macrophage network in pigs during disease progression [8, 10], and the association of the alteration in this immune network with the T-cell response has not been reported. Here, we attempted to explore the dynamics of this important host defence mechanism in relation to PRRSV infection. During infection, PRRSV replicates in the CD163+ cells in the lungs and induces apoptosis at the early stages of infection [33]. In the current study, a flow cytometric analysis of BAL cells revealed that PRRSV-JA142 decreased the CD163+ cell population in the infected pigs at the time when peak viral loads were detected. After the viral load decreased, the CD163+ cell population recovered to the normal levels. PI staining of the CD163+ BAL cells revealed that the decrease in the CD163+ cell population was due to cell death. A similar reduction in the macrophage population after PRRSV-1 infection was previously reported [48]. Following the strategy described previously [11], different subsets of DC and macrophages were identified in BAL cells, and the changes in the populations of these subsets during disease progression were studied. Previous reports verify that PRRSV infection impairs DC function directly by downregulating MHC-II expression [24, 49]. Intriguingly, among the five cell subsets in MHC-II+ cells, only the CD172a+/CD163high/MHC-II+ (AM) cell population decreased significantly at peak viremia, revealing a significant negative correlation between the population of these cells and the viral loads in the lungs, whereas significant positive correlations were found for the other subset populations. The increases in the CD172a+/CD163int/MHC-II+ and CD172a+/CD163low/MHC-II+ cell populations can be attributed to the higher influx of monocytes and their differentiation in the lungs during inflammation. Moreover, CD172a+/CD163\u2212/MHC-II+ and CD172a\u2212/CD163\u2212/MHC-II+ cells exhibit strong migration and antigen-presenting capabilities [10], which can be credited to the increased influx of these cells into the lungs during the course of infection. Our results were in agreement with those obtained in previous studies, which found that the populations of these cells are increased in the BAL after PRRSV-1 infection [8]. Interestingly, cDC1s activate allogenic na\u00efve T cells and aid induction of the Th1 response, whereas cDC2s induce a Th2 response in pigs [10]. After sensing antigen, the mature migrating DC recruit NK cells to drain LN, thus providing an early source of IFN-\u03b3 and thereby promoting Th1 polarization [50]. Thus, DC work together with NK cells to regulate innate immunity and further dictate the direction and intensity of the adaptive immune response [51].",

            "text": "The effective immune response to counter viral infections is governed by the proper activation of T lymphocytes by APC [52]. In the current study, we analysed the dynamics of T lymphocytes in PBMC, lung parenchyma, BAL, and BLN to detect the central cause of the clearance of PRRSV from the body. Delayed induction of Th1, Th17 and CTL responses was observed in the PBMC of the infected pigs after 21 dpc, when most of the virus had been cleared from the blood, whereas in BLN, the virus persists for a longer period, which leads to early and sustained (> 35 dpc) induction of T cell responses. Previous studies also found a delayed induction of effector T cells in the peripheral blood of pigs infected with PRRSV [7, 29]. Intriguingly, significant increases in the frequencies of these T lymphocyte subpopulations were detected in the lung parenchyma and lymphoid tissues of the infected pigs at early stages of infection (10 dpc), when the virus levels were at their peak in the body. In agreement with our findings, a higher frequency of T-helper cells and CTL has been observed in local tissues, such as the BAL, lymph nodes and lung parenchyma, of pigs after swine influenza infection, and this induction has been linked to viral clearance [23]. The local cell-mediated immune responses are considered crucial for the clearance of the influenza virus [53]. Moreover, during human respiratory syncytial virus infection, increased populations of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells exhibiting effector functions have been observed in the BAL of infected patients [54]. A recent study investigating T-cell proliferation in PRRSV-2-infected PBMC at 28 dpi and the expression of lymph node-homing receptors revealed that the T-helper cell response plays a main role in viral clearance and that the CTL response is strongest at the site of infection [55]. In addition, the induction of Th17 cells in local tissues has also been found to be essential for the resolution of respiratory infections [56]. In the present study, the cell responses in BLN and BAL were found to be significantly increased from 10 or 21 dpc and were maintained until 35 dpc, when the virus was completely cleared. Therefore, it can be concluded that local T-cell responses in the lungs, BLN and BAL are induced markedly faster than systemic responses and are maintained at significantly high levels, even after virus clearance, substantiating the critical role of local immune responses in the clearance of PRRSV from pigs.",

            "text": "The Treg lineage is responsible for the maintenance of homeostasis in the immune system by suppressing the activation of various immune cells, including other T cells, NK cells and DC [57]. Treg play a vital role in the pathogenesis of some viral infections that result in severe inflammatory lesions, such as influenza [23]. However, the Treg response in pigs after PRRSV infection is controversial. Although some studies have revealed increased frequencies of Tregs after PRRSV infection [36, 37, 58], other studies revealed that the induction of Tregs was not changed and even suppressed after infection [7, 27]. These conflicting results could be due to the strain-specific response of the pigs to the virus after challenge or to the method used to evaluate the changes in the Treg response. Several studies have revealed that Tregs are induced due to PRRSV infection, but most of these studies were performed using in vitro or ex vivo assays in which PBMC and mononuclear cells isolated from the lungs and lymph nodes of pigs were infected or re-infected with PRRSV and subsequently observed to monitor the proliferation of various T-cell subsets [36, 37, 58]. However, some ex vivo assays have also demonstrated the inability of certain strains of PRRSV to induce Tregs [59]. In the current study, the Treg frequencies were directly evaluated in the peripheral blood, BAL, lung and lymphoid tissues collected from PRRSV-JA142-infected pigs. During the acute phase of infection, the Treg frequencies largely remained unchanged, but suppression was observed in the BAL throughout the infection period and in BLN at 10 dpc. Comparable results were obtained in a previous in vivo study, revealing that the Treg numbers remained unchanged in the PBMC, lymph nodes and tonsils of the infected pigs up to 28 dpc [7]. Similar results were observed in another study, which showed no significant upregulation of Tregs in the lymph nodes and PBMC at the acute phase of PRRSV infection [27]. Furthermore, the decrease in Treg frequencies in JA142-infected pigs could be attributed to phenotypic plasticity, which resulted in most of the na\u00efve CD4+ T cells differentiating into effector cells, such as Th1 and Th17, after being antigenically stimulated during the acute infection [60]. A previous study revealed that the influenza virus-infected pigs showed a similar suppression of Tregs in the BAL and lymph nodes and an increased frequency of T-helper cells during the acute phase of infection [23]. Moreover, in some acute infections of mice with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and influenza virus, little or no effect on the immune response was observed after the removal of Tregs from mice [61, 62]. Based on the findings from these studies, it can be deduced that Tregs play only a minor role during many acute infections, but further studies are needed to understand the ultimate cause of this decline in the Treg populations, specifically in BAL cells during PRRSV infection.",

            "text": "Cytokine secretion by immune cells plays a major role in protection against invading pathogens or in the induction of pathology [63]. The levels of proinflammatory cytokines have often been associated with the severity of the disease. However, lower mRNA and protein expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines have been associated with protection against viruses in pigs infected with PRRSV strains that typically induce mild to moderate clinical signs [64]. PRRSV has been shown to reduce or suppress IFN-\u03b1 production during infection [65]. Similarly, in the current study, IFN-\u03b1 was peripherally suppressed in the infected pigs with increasing viral replication; however, in the BALF, the levels of IFN-\u03b1 were maintained, even at peak viremia, possibly playing a role in local viral clearance. Similar to our observations, the induction of IFN-\u03b1 with increasing viremia has also been observed locally in lymphoid tissues and the BALF in PRRSV-infected pigs [66]. Moreover, local induction of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and IL-8 in lymphoid tissues is reportedly linked to the clearance of PRRSV from infected pigs [67]. Similar induction of the proinflammatory cytokines Il-1\u03b1, IL-6, IL-12, and TNF-\u03b1 has been observed in local tissues in previous studies [66]. In the current study, the induction of proinflammatory cytokines locally in the BALF at peak viremia could thus be linked to their contribution to the clearance of the virus from the pigs. In contrast, the induction of IL-10 in local tissues during early infection was observed in the present study. The production of IL-10, which has been previously observed, reportedly contributes to the persistence of PRRSV by suppressing the immune response in pigs [68]. However, IL-10 production also protects pigs from the tissue damage caused by proinflammatory cytokine overexpression [14]. Tregs are thought to produce IL-10, but in the current study, the Treg frequencies did not change significantly. However, in addition to Tregs, monocytes, Th2 cells, mast cells and B cells are also known sources of IL-10 [69]. Consequently, measuring the systemic cytokine response might not provide a full picture of the protective events orchestrated by cytokines locally in the lungs of PRRSV-infected pigs.",

Moreover, the local proinflammatory cytokine responses at peak viremia augmented the clearance of the virus from the infected pigs. A temporal sequence of immunobiological events after PRRSV infection in pigs is proposed in Figure 11, and the observed schematic suggests that local T lymphocytes might play an important role in the clearance of the virus from pigs during the acute phase of infection. In addition, early NK cell induction and delayed T-cell responses in peripheral blood were also perceived, and these might play a complementary role in viral clearance. Future studies are needed to further elucidate and refine the understanding of the anti-PRRSV immune response in pigs, and these future studies should primarily focus on obtaining a better understanding of and deciphering the local immune responses with the aim of developing an effective strategy to restrain the virus.",

The delayed induction of serum virus-neutralizing antibodies and the T-cell response in peripheral blood at 21 days post-exposure, when most of the virus was cleared from the body, indicate that, in addition to the other factors, the early induced local T-cell response plays a key role in the clearance of the virus.",
