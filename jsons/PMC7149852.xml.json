A good animal model of viral infection should allow assay of many parameters of infection, including clinical signs, growth of virus, clinicopathological parameters, cellular and humoral immune responses, and virus\u2013host interactions. Furthermore, viral replication should be accompanied by measurable clinical manifestations and pathology should resemble that of human cases such that a better understanding of the disease process in humans is attained. There is often more than one animal model that closely represents human disease for a given pathogen. Small animal models are typically used for first-line screening, and for testing the efficacy of vaccines or therapeutics. In contrast, nonhuman primate (NHP) models are often used for pivotal preclinical studies. This approach is also used for basic pathogenesis studies, with most studies in small animal models when possible, and studies in NHPs to fill in the remaining gaps in knowledge.",

Additionally, blood volumes for sampling are limited in small animals, and viruses often need to be adapted through serial passage in the species to induce a productive infection.",

Additionally, SPF and transgenic ferrets are not available, and molecular biological reagents are lacking. Other caveats making ferret models more difficult to work with are their requirement for more space than mice (rabbit-style cages), and the development of aggressive behavior with repeated procedures.",

NHP studies should be carefully designed to ensure the fewest number of animals are used, and the studies should address the most critical questions regarding disease pathogenesis, host\u2013pathogen responses, and protective efficacy of vaccines and therapeutics.",

            "text": "\nNorovirus, the genus of which Norwalk is the prototypic member, is the most common cause of gastroenteritis in the United States (Hall et al., 2013). There are five distinct genogroups (GI\u2013GV) and numerous strains of Norwalk virus, including the particularly significant human pathogens GI.1 Norwalk virus, GII.2 Snow Mountain virus, and GII.1 Hawaii virus. In developing countries, Norwalk virus, also known as \u201cwinter vomiting virus,\u201d is responsible for approximately 200,000 deaths annually (Patel et al., 2008). A typical disease course is self-limiting, but there have been incidences of necrotizing enterocolitis and seizures in infants (Chen et al., 2009, Lutgehetmann et al., 2012, Turcios-Ruiz et al., 2008). Symptoms of infection include diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, abdominal cramping, dehydration, and fever. Incubation is normally 1\u20133 days, with symptoms persisting for 2\u20133 days (Koopmans and Duizer, 2004). Viral shedding can range from 6 to 55 days in healthy individuals (Atmar et al., 2014). However, longer illness duration can be indicative of immunocompromised status, with the elderly and young having a prolonged state of shedding (Harris et al., 2008, Rockx et al., 2002). Interestingly, individuals vary greatly in susceptibility to norovirus infection depending on their fucosyl transferase 2 (FUT2) allele functionality and histoblood group antigen status, with type A and O individuals susceptible and types AB and B resistant (Hutson et al., 2005).\n",

Vomiting results in airborne dissemination of the virus with areas of 7.8 m2 being contaminated and subsequent transmission from oral deposition of airborne particles or contact with contaminated fomites, which can remain contaminated for up to 42 days (Makison Booth, 2014, Tung-Thompson et al., 2015). Each vomiting event in a classroom setting elevates the risk of norovirus illness among elementary students with proximity correlating with attack rates (Evans et al., 2002, Marks et al., 2003). Viral titers in emesis and fecal suspensions are as high as 1.2 \u00d7 107 and 1.6 \u00d7 1011 GES (genomic equivalent copies per milliliter), respectively and the 50% infectious dose is 1320 GES (Atmar et al., 2014). Therefore, outbreaks can be extremely difficult to contain. Therapeutic intervention consists of rehydration therapy and antiemetic medication (Bucardo et al., 2008, Moe et al., 2001). No approved vaccine or therapeutic is available, and development has been challenging given that immunity is short-lived after infection, new strains rapidly evolve and the correlates of protection are not completely understood (Chen et al., 2013). However, one promising strategy utilized a virus-like particle (VLP)-based vaccine that protected or reduced infection by almost 50% in human volunteers (Aliabadi et al., 2015, Atmar et al., 2011).",

NHPs including marmosets, cotton-top tamarins, and rhesus macaques infected with Norwalk virus are monitored for the extent of viral shedding; however, no clinical disease is observed in these models. Disease progression and severity is measured exclusively by assay of viral shedding (Rockx et al., 2005). Incidentally, more viruses were needed to create an infection when challenging by the oral route than by the intravenous (IV) route (Purcell et al., 2002). Chimpanzees were exposed to a clinical isolate of Norwalk virus by the IV route (Bok et al., 2011). Although none of the animals developed disease symptoms, viral shedding within the feces was observed within 2\u20135 days postinfection and lasted anywhere from 17 days to 6 weeks. Viremia never occurred and no histopathological changes were detected. The amount and duration of viral shedding was in-line with what is observed upon human infection. As such, chimeric chimpanzee\u2013human antinorovirus neutralizing antibodies have been explored as a possible therapeutic strategy (Chen et al., 2013).",

Importantly, EEEV pathogenesis is dependent on route of infection with delayed progression upon subcutaneous (subQ) exposure (Honnold et al., 2015). Newborn mice display neuronal damage with rapid disease progression, resulting in death (Murphy and Whitfield, 1970). Similarly, EEEV produces fatal encephalitis in older mice when administered via the intracerebral route, while inoculation via the subQ route causes a pantropic infection eventually resulting in encephalitis (Liu et al., 1970, Morgan, 1941). A general drawback to the usage of the mouse model is the lack of vascular involvement during the disease course (Liu et al., 1970).",

Death occurred between days 7 and 14 with brain and mesodermal tissues, such as heart, lungs, liver, and kidney involvement (Aguilar, 1970, Monath et al., 1978). Intracerebral and IN routes of infection resulted in a fatal disease that was highly dependent on dose while intradermal (ID) and subQ inoculations caused only 50% fatality in mice regardless of the amount of virus (Liu et al., 1970). Comparing susceptibility of inbred and outbred strains revealed that CD-1, BALB/c, A/J, and C57BL6 mice were all highly susceptible to experimental infection via subQ inoculation when challenged prior to 10 weeks old with CNS involvement and lethality (Blakely et al., 2015). SubQ/dermal infection in the mouse model results in encephalitic disease very similar to that seen in horses and humans (MacDonald and Johnston, 2000). Virus begins to replicate in the draining lymph nodes at 4 h postinoculation. Eventually, virus enters the brain primarily via the olfactory system.",

Aerosol and dermal inoculation routes cause neurological pathology in mice much faster than other routes of exposure. The clinical signs of disease in mice infected by aerosol are ruffled fur, lethargy, and hunching progressing to death (Charles et al., 1995, Steele and Twenhafel, 2010, Steele et al., 1998). IN challenge of C3H/HeN mice with high dose VEEV caused high morbidity and mortality (Julander et al., 2008b). Viral titers in brain peaked on day 4 postchallenge and remained elevated until animals succumbed on day 9\u201310 postchallenge.

Intracerebral infection of EEEV produces nervous system disease and fatality in monkeys (Nathanson et al., 1969). The differences in these models indicate that the initial viremia and the secondary nervous system infection do not overlap in NHPs when they are inoculated by the peripheral route (Wyckoff, 1939). IN and intralingual inoculations of EEEV also cause nervous system symptoms in monkeys, but are less drastic than intracerebral injections (Wyckoff, 1939). The aerosol route of delivery will result in uniformly lethal disease in cynomolgus macaques (Reed et al., 2007). In this model, fever was followed by elevated white blood cells and liver enzymes. Neurological signs subsequently developed and NHPs became moribund and were euthanized between 5\u20139 days postexposure. Meningoencephalomyelitis was the main pathology observed in the brains of these animals (Steele and Twenhafel, 2010). Similar clinical signs and pathology were observed when common marmosets were infected with EEEV by the IN route (Adams et al., 2008). Both aerosol and IN NHP models had similar disease progression and pathology as seen in human disease. Very limited studies have been performed with NHPs.",

Leukopenia was common in animals exhibiting fever (Monath et al., 1974). Supporting the leukopenia, microscopic changes in lymphatic tissues, such as early destruction of lymphocytes in lymph nodes and spleen, a mild lymphocytic infiltrate in the hepatic triads, and focal myocardial necrosis with lymphocytic infiltration have been observed in monkeys infected with VEEV. Surprisingly, characteristic lesions of the CNS were observed histopathologically in monkeys in spite of the lack of any clinical signs of infection (Gleiser et al., 1961). The primary lesions were lymphocytic perivascular cuffing and glial proliferation and generally observed at day 6 postinfection during the secondary febrile episode. Similar to these observations, when cynomolgus macaques were exposed to aerosolized VEEV, fever, viremia, lymphopenia, and clinical signs of encephalitis were observed but the NHPs did not succumb to disease (Reed et al., 2004).",

Adult IFN\u03b1/\u03b2R knockout mice also developed mild disease with symptoms including muscle weakness and lethargy, symptoms that mirrored human infection. All adult mice died within 3 days. This model was useful in identifying the viral cellular tropism for fibroblasts (Couderc et al., 2008). ICR and CD-1 mice can also be utilized as a disease model. Neonatal mice inoculated subQ with a passaged clinical isolate of CHIKV developed lethargy, loss of balance, and difficulty walking. Mortality was low, 17 and 8% for newborn CD-1 and ICR mice, respectively. The remaining mice fully recovered within 6 weeks after infection (Ziegler et al., 2008). A drawback of both the IFN\u03b1/\u03b2R and CD-1 mice is that the disease is not a result of immunopathogenesis as occurs in human cases, given that the mice are immunocompromised (Teo et al., 2012).",

Overall blood chemistries changed in conjunction with initiation of viremia, and returned to baseline 10\u201315 days postexposure (Chen et al., 2010).

Several laboratory mouse strains including A/J, BALB/c, and C57BL/6 are permissive to dengue infection. However, the resulting disease has little resemblance to human clinical signs, and death results from paralysis (Huang et al., 2000, Paes et al., 2005, Shresta et al., 2004). A higher dose of an adapted DENV strain induced DHF symptoms in both BALB/c and C57BL/6 (Chen et al., 2007, Souza et al., 2009). This model can also yield asymptomatic infections. A mouse-adapted strain of DENV 2 introduced into AG129 mice developed vascular leak syndrome similar to the severe disease seen in humans (Shresta et al., 2006). Passive transfer of monoclonal dengue antibodies within mice leads to ADE. During the course of infection, viremia was increased and animals died due to vascular leak syndrome (Balsitis et al., 2010). Another mouse-adapted strain injected into BALB/c caused liver damage, hemorrhagic manifestations, and vascular permeability (Souza et al., 2009). IC injection of suckling mice with DENV leads to death by paralysis and encephalitis, which is rare in human infection (Lee et al., 2015, Parida et al., 2002, Zhao et al., 2014a).",

After the initial isolation of WNV, the virus was subsequently isolated from patients, birds, and mosquitoes in Egypt in the early 1950s (Melnick et al., 1951, Taylor et al., 1953) and was shown to cause encephalitis in humans and horses. WNV is recognized as the most widespread of the flaviviruses, with a geographical distribution that includes Africa, the Middle East, western Asia, Europe, and Australia (Hayes, 1989). The virus first reached the Western Hemisphere in the summer of 1999, during an outbreak involving humans, horses, and birds in the New York City metropolitan area (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1999, Lanciotti et al., 1999). Since 1999, the range of areas affected by WNV quickly extended. Older people and children are most susceptible to WNV disease. WNV generally causes asymptomatic disease or a mild undifferentiated fever (West Nile fever), which can last from 3 to 6 days (Monath and Tsai, 2002). The mortality rate following neuroinvasive disease ranges from 4% to 11% (Asnis et al., 2000, Hayes, 1989, Hubalek and Halouzka, 1999, Komar, 2000). The most severe complications are commonly seen in the elderly, with reported case fatality rates from 4% to 11%. Hepatitis, myocarditis, and pancreatitis are unusual, severe, nonneurologic manifestations of WNV infection.",

Viral persistence is observed in these animals regardless of the outcome of infection (i.e., asymptomatic, fever, encephalitis) (Pogodina et al., 1983). Thus, viral persistence is regarded as a typical result of NHP infection with various WNV strains. After both intracerebral and subQ inoculation, the virus localizes predominantly in the brain and may also be found in the kidneys, spleen, and lymph nodes. WNV does not result in clinical disease in NHPs although the animals show a low level of viremia (Lieberman et al., 2009, Pletnev et al., 2003). This is mirrored in New Zealand White rabbits in that they only develop fever and low levels of viremia following inoculation via footpad (Suen et al., 2015). ID inoculation of both marmosets and rhesus macaques did not yield any clinical signs of disease including fever. Viremia was detected in both NHP species, but marmosets developed a higher titer for a greater duration than rhesus (Verstrepen et al., 2014).",

ID route pathogenesis studies indicated that Langerhans dendritic cells are the initial viral replication sites in the skin (Brown et al., 2007, Johnston et al., 1996). The infected Langerhans cells then migrate to lymph nodes and the virus enters the blood through lymphatic and thoracic ducts and disseminates to peripheral tissues for secondary viral replication. Virus eventually travels to the CNS and causes pathology that is similar to human cases (Byrne et al., 2001, Cunha et al., 2000, Diamond et al., 2003, Fratkin et al., 2004). The Swiss mouse strain was inoculated IP in order to screen a variety of viral lineages to assess differences in pathogenesis (Bingham et al., 2014).",

The clinical disease spectrum is highly variable with reports of a flu-like illness accompanied by rash, Guillan\u2013Barre syndrome, and microcephaly in newborns (Ramos da Silva and Gao, 2016). To date, a correlation between gestational age at which exposure to the virus occurs and severity of microcephaly is not fully understood (Brasil et al., 2016). However, a recent study of pregnant women in Columbia found that infection with Zika virus during the third trimester was not associated with any obvious structural abnormalities of the fetus (Pacheco et al., 2016). Transmission of the virus occurs via the bite from an infected A. aegypti or A. albopictus (Ramos da Silva and Gao, 2016). Other reported routes of exposure include sexual transmission and blood transfusion (Cunha et al., 2016, D\u2019Ortenzio et al., 2016, Hills et al., 2016, McCarthy, 2016). The emergence of this virus with no approved vaccine or therapy, and few diagnostic options demonstrates the utility of well-characterized animal model development.",

Microscopic lesions within the brain were noted upon necropsy. In conjunction, viral RNA was detected in the blood, brain, ovary, spleen, and liver of the infected mice. Wild-type 129Sv/Ev mice were also challenged with no observable clinical disease. However, viral RNA was detected at day 3 postinfection in the blood, ovary and spleen, and then remained at detectable levels in the ovaries and spleen on day 7 (Dowall et al., 2016). Footpad inoculation of the virus leads to a fatal disease in AG129 mice by day 7 postinoculation with significant histopathological changes in the brain noted at necropsy (Aliota et al., 2016). AG129 mice were also observed to develop neurologic disease by day 6 postexposure (Rossi et al., 2016). Immunocompetent mice are resistant to infection via the subQ route (Rossi et al., 2016).",

Viral RNA was detected in five out of nine placentas on day 3 postinfection. The virus was able to infect the radial glia cells in the fetal brain and leads to a reduction in the cortical neural progenitors (Wu et al., 2016). Viral exposure via cerebroventricular space/lateral ventricle of the fetal brain exhibited small brain size at day 5 postexposure in addition to cortical thinning (Cugola et al., 2016, Li et al., 2016a). Ifnar1\u2212/\u2212 pregnant mice exposed to the virus had nonviable fetuses. In the same study, wild-type mice were given an anti-ifnar antibody prior to and during infection resulting in detectable virus in the fetal head with mild intrauterine growth restriction (Miner et al., 2016). All of these murine studies will further study of the pathogenesis of vertical transmission and the resulting neurological disorders in conjunction with screening novel countermeasures.

Clinical illness and viral loads have not been consistent; however, replication within the lungs and DAD are features of the infections for each of the primate species. Some cynos have no illness but others have rash, lethargy, and respiratory signs and pathology (Haagmans et al., 2004, Martina et al., 2003, McAuliffe et al., 2004, Rowe et al., 2004).

AGMs infected with SARS-CoV have no overt clinical signs but DAD and pneumonitis has been documented (McAuliffe et al., 2004). Viral replication has been detected for up to 10 days in the lungs of AGMS; however, the infection resolves, and does not progress to fatal ARDS.",

As such, several approaches have been used to create susceptible murine animal models of MERS-CoV infection by inducing the expression of hDPP4. One approach utilized an adenovirus vector expressing hDPP4 to transduce mice (Zhao et al., 2014b). These mice developed pneumonia but survived MERS-CoV infection. IN MERS-CoV infection of mice with global expression of hDPP4 resulted in ID50 and LD50 values of <1 and 10 TCID50, respectively (Tao et al., 2016). Thus, MERS-CoV infection of these transgenic mice can be either sublethal or uniformly lethal depending on the dose. Inflammatory infiltrates were found in the lungs and brain stems of mice with some focal infiltrates in the liver as well. Another strategy uses transgenic mice expressing hDPP4 under either a surfactant protein C or cytokeratin 10 promoter (Li et al., 2016b). IN MERS-CoV infection in these mice resulted in a uniformly lethal disease characterized by alveolar edema and microvascular thrombosis and mononuclear clear cell infiltration in the lungs. The brain stem was also impacted by the infection. DPP4 expression with an ubiquitously expressing promoter from cytomegalovirus also had a uniformly lethal infection with predominant lung and brain involvement, but numerous other tissues were also impacted and contained virus (Agrawal et al., 2015).",

            "text": "Filoviridae consists of three genera, Ebolavirus and Marburgvirus, and a newly discovered group, Cuevavirus (Kuhn, 2008). It is thought that various species of bats are the natural host reservoir for these viruses that have lethality rates from 40% to 82% in humans. There is evidence that the Egyptian rousette bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus) is the natural reservoir for marburgviruses but may not be for ebolaviruses (Jones et al., 2015). Marburg virus (MARV) first emerged in 1967 in Germany when laboratory workers contracted the virus from AGMs (Chlorocebus aerthiops) that were shipped from Uganda. Ebolaviruses Sudan and Zaire (SUDV and EBOV) caused nearly simultaneous outbreaks in 1976 in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The most recent outbreak of EBOV in West Africa was by far the largest with over 28,000 suspected, probable and confirmed cases and over 11,000 deaths. Bundibugyo virus (BDBV) first emerged in 2007 in Bundibugyo, Uganda with 56 confirmed cases (MacNeil et al., 2010). Two other ebolaviruses are known: Ta\u00ef Forest (TAFV) (previously named Cote d\u2019Ivoire) (CIEBOV) and Reston (RESTV), which have not caused major outbreaks or lethal disease in humans. Filovirus disease in humans is a characterized by aberrant innate immunity and a number of clinical symptoms: fever, nausea, vomiting, arthralgia/myalgia, headaches, sore throat, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and anorexia as well as numerous others (Mehedi et al., 2011, Wauquier et al., 2010). Approximately 10% of patients develop petechia and a greater percentage, depending on the specific strain, may develop bleeding from various sites (gums, puncture sites, stools, etc.) (Table 33.2\n). Natural transmission in an epidemic is through direct contact or needle sticks in hospital settings. However, much of the research interest in filoviruses primarily stems from biodefense needs, particularly from aerosol biothreats. As such, IM, IP, and aerosol models have been developed in mice, hamsters, guinea pigs, and NHPs for the study of pathogenesis, correlates of immunity, and for testing countermeasures (Bradfute and Bavari, 2011, Bradfute et al., 2011). Since filoviruses have such high lethality rates in humans, scientists have looked for models that are uniformly lethal to stringently test efficacy of candidate vaccines and therapeutics. One issue to take note of in animal model development of filovirus infection is the impact of particle to plaque-forming unit (PFU) ratios on lethality, wherein it is possible that increasing the dose could actually decrease infectivity due to an immunogenic effect produced by inactive virions in the stock. Additionally, the plaque assay used to measure live virions in a stock may greatly underestimate the true quantity of infectious virions in a preparation (Alfson et al., 2015, Smither et al., 2013a).",

However, wild-type inbred mice are susceptible to filovirus that has been mouse adapted (MA) by serial passage in mice (Bray et al., 1999). MARV Angola was particularly resistant to adaptation, but after 24 serial passages in SCID mice, infection caused severe disease in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice when administered IN or IP (Qiu et al., 2014). These mice had pathology with some similarities to infection in humans including lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, liver damage, and viremia. BALB/c mice, which are the strain of choice for IP inoculation of MA-EBOV, are not susceptible by the aerosol route (Bray et al., 1999, Zumbrun et al., 2012a). For aerosol infection of immunocompetent mice, a panel of BXD (BALB/c x DBA) recombinant inbred strains were screened and one strain, BXD34, was particularly susceptible to airborne MA-EBOV, with 100% lethality to low or high doses (approximately 100 or 1000 pfu) (Zumbrun et al., 2012a). These mice developed weight loss of greater than 15% and succumbed to infection between days 7 and 8 postexposure. The aerosol infection model utilizes a whole-body exposure chamber to expose mice aged 6\u20138 weeks to MA-EBOV aerosols with a mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) of approximately 1.6 \u03bcm and a geometric standard deviation (GSD) of approximately 2.0 for 10 min. Another approach uses immunodeficient mouse strains, such as SCID, STAT1 KO, IFN receptor KO, or perforin KO with a wild-type EBOV inoculum by IP or aerosol routes (Bray, 2001, Lever et al., 2012, Zumbrun et al., 2012a). Mice are typically monitored for clinical disease \u201cscores\u201d based on activity and appearance, weight loss, and moribund condition (survival). Coagulopathy, a hallmark of filovirus infection in humans, has been observed, with bleeding in a subset of animals and failure of blood samples to coagulate late in infection (Bray et al., 1999). Liver, kidney, spleen, and lung tissue taken from moribund mice have pathology characteristic of filovirus disease in NHPs (Zumbrun et al., 2012a). While most mouse studies have used MA-EBOV or EBOV, an IP mouse-adapted MARV model is also available (Warfield et al., 2007, Warfield et al., 2009). MA-MARV and MA-EBOV models are particularly useful for screening novel antiviral compounds (Panchal et al., 2012).",

The transplanted mice had all of the cellular components of a fully functional adaptive human immune system and upon EBOV infection, had several features typical of EBOV disease. These included viremia, cellular damage, liver steatosis, and signs of hemorrhage. INFa/bR\u2212/\u2212 mice infected with WT SUDV or EBOV have a partially lethal disease with weight loss and evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in the liver (Brannan et al., 2015, Lever et al., 2012).

Guinea pig models of filovirus infection are quite useful in that they develop fever, which can be monitored at frequent intervals by telemetry. Additionally, the animals are large enough for regular blood sampling in which measurable coagulation defects are observed as the infection progresses. A comparison of IP infection of outbred guinea pigs with guinea pig-adapted MARV Angola and MARV Ravn revealed similar pathogenesis (Cross et al., 2015). Infection with either strain resulted in features of the disease that are similar to what is seen in human and NHP infection, such as viremia, fever, coagulopathy, lymphopenia, elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), thrombocytopenia, and splenic, gastrointestinal and hepatic lesions.

This is in contrast to subQ infection of guinea pigs, aerosol EBOV challenge of NHPs, and natural human infection (Twenhafel et al., 2015). Both subQ and aerosol exposure of guinea pigs to GP-EBOV resulted in only mild lesions in the liver and spleen. By aerosol exposure, GP-EBOV is uniformly lethal at both high and low doses (100 or 1000 pfu target doses) but lethality drops with low (less than 1000 pfu) presented doses of airborne GP-MARV and more protracted disease is seen in some animals (our unpublished observations) (Zumbrun et al., 2012c). Weight loss of between 15% and 25% is a common finding in guinea pigs exposed to GP-EBOV or GP-MARV. Fever, which becomes apparent by day 5, occurs more rapidly in GP-EBOV exposed guinea pigs than with GP-MARV exposure. Lymphocytes and neutrophils increase during the earlier part of the disease, and platelet levels steadily drop as the disease progresses. Increases in coagulation time can be seen as early as day 6 postexposure. Blood chemistries (i.e., ALT, AST, ALKP, and BUN) indicating problems with liver and kidney function are also altered late in the disease course.",

Nonexposed guinea pigs were placed in the cages with infected guinea pigs 1 day postexposure to GP-EBOV. Guinea pigs challenged intanasally were more likely to transmit virus to naive cagemates than those that were exposed by the IP route.

Petechial rash is a common sign of filovirus disease and may be more frequently observed in cynomolgus macaques than in other NHP species (Zumbrun et al., 2012b). Immunological parameters have been evaluated and T, B, and natural killer cells are greatly diminished as the infection progresses (Fernando et al., 2015). A cytokine storm occurs with rises in IFN\u03b3, TNF, IL-6, and CCL2 (Fernando et al., 2015). However, there is also evidence from transcriptional profiling of circulating immune cells that the early immune response is skewed toward a Th2 response (Connor et al., 2015). Strikingly, animals surviving challenge may have a delay in the production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (Martins et al., 2015).",

Dyspnea late in infection is a prominent feature of disease after aerosol exposure (Zumbrun et al., 2012b). Aerosol filovirus infection of NHPs results in early infection of respiratory lymphoid tissues, dendritic cells, alveolar macrophages, blood monocytes, and fibroblastic reticular cells followed by spread to regional lymph nodes then multiple organs (Ewers et al., 2016, Twenhafel et al., 2013). A number of pronounced pathology findings include multifocal hepatic necrosis and fibrin accumulation, particularly within the liver and the spleen. For aerosolized MARV infection of rhesus, the most significant pathology included destruction of the tracheobronchial and mediastinal lymph nodes (Ewers et al., 2016). Lymphocytolysis and lymphoid depletion are also observed (Alves et al., 2010). Multilead, surgically implanted telemetry devices are useful in continuous collection of temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and activity levels. As such, blood pressure drops as animals become moribund and heart rate variability (standard deviation of the heart rate) is altered late in infection (Zumbrun et al., 2012b).

The cotton rats develop mild to moderate bronchiolitis or pneumonia (Grieves et al., 2015, Prince et al., 1999). Although age does not appear to factor into clinical outcome, it has been reported that older cotton rats tend to take longer to achieve viral clearance. Viral loads peak by the 5th day, dropping to below the levels of detection by day 8. The histopathology of the lungs appears similar to that of humans after infection (Piazza et al., 1993). This model has limited use in modeling the human immune response to infection as challenge with the virus induces a Th2 response in cotton rats, whereas humans tend to have a response skewed toward Th1 (Culley et al., 2002, Dakhama et al., 2005, Ripple et al., 2010). FI-RSV disease was recapitulated upon challenge with live virus after being vaccinated twice with FI-RSV.",

Lethality rates can vary with virus strain used (with or without adaptation), dose, route of inoculation, age, and genetic background of the animal. The various animal models can capture differing diseases caused by influenza: benign, severe, super infection, and sepsis, severe with ARDS, and neurologic manifestations (Barnard, 2009). Also, models can utilize seasonal or avian strains and have been developed to study transmission, important for understanding the potential for more lethal strains, such as H5N1 for spreading among humans.",

When performing influenza studies in ferrets, animals should be serologically negative for circulating influenza viruses. Infected animals should be placed in a separate room from uninfected animals. If animals must be placed in the same room, uninfected ferrets should be handled before infected ferrets. Anesthetized ferrets are experimentally exposed to influenza by IN inoculation of 0.25\u20130.5 mL containing approximately 104\u2013106 egg ID50 dropwise to each nostril. However, a larger inoculum volume of 1.0 mL has also been explored as being more appropriate, yielding more severe and consistent respiratory tract pathology, likely because the larger inoculum is more widely distributed in the lower respiratory tract (Moore et al., 2014). Video tracking to assign values to activity levels in ferrets can aid ferret studies, eliminating the need for collection of subjective and arbitrary clinical scores (Oh et al., 2015).

Ferrets are more susceptible to influenza A than influenza B strains and are also susceptible to avian influenza H5N1 strains without adaptation (Zitzow et al., 2002). However, the localized immune responses within the respiratory tract of ferrets infected with influenza A and B have been characterized and are similar (Carolan et al., 2015). Virulence and degree of pneumonitis caused by different influenza subtypes and strains vary from mild to severe and generally mirrors that seen in humans (Stark et al., 2013). Nonadapted H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2 have mild to moderate virulence in ferrets. The sequencing of the ferret genome has allowed for the characterization of the ferret host response using RNA-seq analysis (Peng et al., 2014). Distinct signatures were obtained depending on the particular influenza strain to inoculate the ferrets. Also helpful is the sequencing and characterization of the influenza ferret infectome during different stages of the infection in na\u00efve or immune ferrets (Leon et al., 2013).",

Features associated with increased clinical disease are weakened hemagglutinin antibody generation and attenuated Th1 responses. Pregnant and breastfeeding women and infants are also susceptible to more severe illness from influenza virus. To study this dynamic, a breastfeeding mother\u2013infant ferret influenza infection model was created (Paquette et al., 2015). Notably, the mammary gland itself harbored virus and transcript analysis showed downregulation of milk production genes. In support of the development of therapies, the ferret influenza model for pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics studies of antiviral drugs as also been developed (Reddy et al., 2015). Critical to this model is ensuring pronounced clinical signs and robust viral replication upon influenza infection. Strains of low virulence have predominant replication in the nasal turbinates of ferrets. Clinical signs and other disease indicators in ferrets are similar to that of humans with mild respiratory disease, sneezing, nasal secretions containing virus, fever, weight loss, high viral titers, and inflammatory infiltrate in the airways, bronchitis, and pneumonia (Svitek et al., 2008). Replication in both the upper and lower airways is associated with more severe disease and greater mortality. Additionally, increased expression of proinflammatory mediators and reduced expression of antiinflammatory mediators in the lower respiratory tract of ferrets correlates with severe disease and lethal outcome. H5N1-infected ferrets develop severe lethargy, greater interferon response, transient lymphopenia, and replication in respiratory tract, brain, and other organs (Peng et al., 2012, Zitzow et al., 2002).",

In general, some subtypes, such as the 2009 H1N1, can transmit easily through aerosol and respiratory droplets (Munster et al., 2009). Of concern, H7N9 isolated from humans was more pathogenic and readily transmissible between ferrets by larger respiratory droplets and smaller particle aerosols (Kreijtz et al., 2013, Richard et al., 2013, Zhang et al., 2013). H5N1 became transmissible by adopting just four mutations, spreading between ferrets in separate cages (Imai et al., 2012). Transmission occurs more readily at the height of pyrexia, but for the 2009 H1N1 in particular, can occur before fever is detected (Roberts et al., 2012). Ferret-to-ferret transmission of a mouse-adapted influenza B virus has also been demonstrated (Kim et al., 2015). Since ferrets can be expensive and cumbersome, influenza infection has been characterized and a transmission model developed in the guinea pig; however, this is a newer model with infrequent utilization thus far (Lowen et al., 2014).",

Bente et al. infected STAT1 knockout mice by the IP route. In this model, after the signs of fever, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, viremia, elevated liver enzymes and proinflammatory cytokines, mice were moribund and succumbed to disease in 3\u20135 days postexposure. The second model was developed by using interferon alpha/beta (IFN\u03b1/\u03b2) receptor knockout mice (IFNAR\u2212/\u2212) (Bereczky et al., 2010). Similar observations were made in this model as in the STAT1 knockout mouse model. Animals were moribund and died 2\u20134 days after exposure with high viremia levels in liver and spleen. Characterization studies with IFNAR\u2212/\u2212mice challenged with different routes (IP, IN, IM, and subQ) showed that CCHFV causes acute disease with high viral loads, pathology in liver and lymphoid tissues, increased proinflammatory response, severe thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and death, all of which are characteristics of human disease (Zivcec et al., 2013). Proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as G-CSF, IFN\u03b3, CXCCL10, CCL2 increased dramatically day 3 postchallenge and GM-CSF, IL-1a, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-6, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-17, CXCL1, CCL3, CCL5, and TNF-\u03b1 concentrations were extremely elevated at the time of death/euthanasia. This model is also utilized to test therapeutics, such as ribavirin, arbidol, and T-705 (favipiravir) successfully (Oestereich et al., 2014). Experimental vaccines developed for CCHF were evaluated in this model provided protection compare to unvaccinated mice (Buttigieg et al., 2014; Canakoglu et al., 2015, p. 725). Thus, the IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mouse model would be a good choice to test medical countermeasures against CCHFV, although they have an impaired IFN and immune response phenotype.",

Hamsters inoculated IM with a passaged Andes viral strain died within 11 days postinfection. Clinical signs did not appear until 24 h prior to death at which point the hamsters were moribund and in respiratory distress. Mortality was dose dependent, with high inoculums leading to a shorter incubation before death. During the same study, hamsters were inoculated with a passaged SNV isolate. No hamsters developed any symptoms during the course of observation. However, an antibody response to the virus that was not dose dependent was determined via ELISA. Hamsters infected with ANDV have significant histopathological changes to their lung, liver, and spleen. All had an interstitial pneumonia with intraalveolar edema. Infectious virus could be recovered from these organs. Viremia began on day 8 and lasted up to 12 days postinfection. Infection of hamsters with ANDV yielded a similar clinical disease progression as is seen in human HPS including rapid progression to death, fluid in the pleural cavity, and significant histopathological changes to the lungs and spleen. A major deviation in the hamster model is the detection of infectious virus within the liver (Hooper et al., 2001). Normally, SNV does not cause a disease in hamsters (Wahl-Jensen et al., 2007). But a recent study showed that immunosuppression with dexamethasone and cyclophosphamide in combination causes lethal disease with SNV in hamsters (Brocato et al., 2014). The disease was very similar to the disease caused by ANDV in hamsters.",

The disease outcome is very much dependent on the age of the mice. Younger mice are much more susceptible to virus than the adult mice. Adult mice exposed to Hanta virus leads to a fatal disease dependent upon viral strain and route of infection. The disease progression is marked by neurological or pulmonary manifestations that do not mirror human disease (Seto et al., 2012, Wichmann et al., 2002). Knockout mice lacking IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 are highly susceptible to Hanta virus infection (Muller et al., 1994). In a study of panel of laboratory strains of mice, C57BL/6 mice were most susceptible to a passaged Hanta viral strain injected IP. Animals progressed to neurological manifestation including paralyses and convulsions, and succumbed to infection within 24\u201336 h postinfection. Clinical disease was markedly different from that observed in human cases (Wichmann et al., 2002). In a recent study, 2-week-old ICR mice was exposed to HTNV strain AA57 via the subQ route (Seto et al., 2012). Mice started to show signs of disease by day 11 postinoculation. Piloerection, trembling, hunching, loss of body weight, labored breathing, and severe respiratory disease were observed in mice.",

Aerosolized infection of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus has been a useful model for Lassa fever. Both rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys exposed to the virus developed disease, but rhesus mirrored more closely the disease course and histopathology observed in human infection (Danes et al., 1963). IV or intragastric inoculation of the virus led to severe dehydration, erythematous skin, submucosal edema, necrotic foci in the buccal cavity, and respiratory distress. The liver was severely affected by the virus as depicted by measuring the liver enzymes AST and ALT (Lukashevich et al., 2003). Disease was dose dependent with IV, intramuscular, and subQ inoculation requiring the least amount of virus to induce disease. Aerosol infections and eating contaminated food could also be utilized, and mimic a more natural route of infection (Peters et al., 1987). Within this model, the NHP becomes viremic after 4\u20136 days. Clinical manifestations were present by day 7 and death typically occurred within 10\u201314 days (Lukashevich et al., 2004, Rodas et al., 2004). Intramuscular injection of Lassa virus into cynomolgus monkeys also produced a neurological disease due to lesions within the CNS (Hensley et al., 2011b). This pathogenicity is seen in select cases of human Lassa fever (Cummins et al., 1992, Gunther et al., 2001).",

Guinea pig inbred strain 13 was highly susceptible to Lassa virus infection. The outbred Hartley strain was less susceptible, and thus strain 13 has been the preferred model given its assured lethality. The clinical manifestations mirror those seen in humans and rhesus (Jahrling et al., 1982). Infection with Pichinde virus passaged in guinea pigs has also been used. Disease signs include fever, weight loss, vascular collapse, and eventual death (Lucia et al., 1990, Qian et al., 1994).

            "text": "HIV has a narrow host range likely because the virus is unable to antagonize and evade effector molecules of the interferon response (Thippeshappa et al., 2012). Humanized mice, created by engrafting human cells and tissues into SCID mice, have been critical for the development of mouse models for the study of HIV infection. A number of different humanized mouse models allow for the study of HIV infection in the context of an intact and functional human innate and adaptive immune responses (Berges and Rowan, 2011). The SCIDHu HIV infection model has proven useful, particularly in screening antivirals and therapeutics (Denton et al., 2008, Melkus et al., 2006). A number of different humanized mouse models have been developed for the study of HIV, including Rag1\u2212/\u2212\u03b3c\u2212/\u2212, Rag2\u2212/\u2212\u03b3c\u2212/\u2212, NOD/SCID\u03b3c\u2212/\u2212 (hNOG), NOD/SCID\u03b3c\u2212/\u2212 (hNSG), NOD/SCID BLT, and NOD/SCID\u03b3c\u2212/\u2212 (hNSG) BLT (Karpel et al., 2015, Li et al., 2015, Shimizu et al., 2015). CD34+ human stem cells derived from umbilical cord blood or fetal liver are used for humanization (Baenziger et al., 2006, Watanabe et al., 2007). HIV-1 infection by IP injection can be successful with as little as 5% peripheral blood engraftment (Berges et al., 2006). Vaginal and rectal transmission models have been developed in BLT SCID Hu mice in which mice harbor human bone marrow, liver, and thymus tissue. HIV-1 viremia occurs within approximately 7 days postinoculation (Zhang et al., 2007). In many of these models, spleen, lymph nodes, and thymus tissues are highly positive for virus, similar to humans (Brainard et al., 2009). Importantly, depletion of human T-cells can be observed in blood and lymphoid tissues of HIV-infected humanized mice and at least some mechanisms of pathogenesis that occur in HIV-infected humans, also occur in the HIV-infected humanized mouse models (Baenziger et al., 2006, Neff et al., 2011). The advantage of these models is that these mice are susceptible to HIV infection and thus the impact of drugs on the intended viral targets can be tested. One caveat is that while mice have a \u201ccommon mucosal immune system,\u201d humans do not, due to differences in the distribution of addressins (Holmgren and Czerkinsky, 2005). Thus, murine mucosal immune responses to HIV do not reflect those of humans. Another strategy uses a human CD4- and human CCR5- expressing transgenic luciferase reporter mouse to study HIV-1 pseudovirus entry (Gruell et al., 2013).",

An adaptation of HIV-1 was obtained by four passages in pigtailed macaques transiently depleted of CD8(+) cells during acute infection (Hatziioannou et al., 2014). The resulting disease has several similarities to AIDS in humans, such as depletion of CD4(+) T-cells (Kimata, 2014). Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection of macaques has been widely used as a platform for modeling HIV infection of humans (Demberg and Robert-Guroff, 2015, Walker et al., 2015). Importantly, NHPs have similar, pharmacokinetics, metabolism, mucosal T-cell homing receptors, and vascular addressins to those of humans. Thus, while the correlates of protection against HIV are still not completely known, immune responses to HIV infection and vaccination are likely comparable. These models mimic infection through use of contaminated needles (IV), sexual transmission (vaginal or rectal), and maternal transmission in utero or through breast milk (Keele et al., 2009, Miller et al., 2005, Stone et al., 2009). There are also macaque models to study the emergence and clinical implications of HIV drug resistance (Van Rompay et al., 2002).",

However, the polymerase region of SIV is 60% homologous to that of HIV-1 and it is susceptible to many reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease inhibitors.

However, a more realistic result may be to reduce severity of infection and permanently prevent progression. Strategies have included live attenuated, nonreplicating, and subunit vaccines. These have variable efficacy in NHPs due to the genetics of the host (MHC and TRIM alleles), differences between challenge strains, and challenge routes (Letvin et al., 2011). NHP models have led to the development of antiviral treatments that are effective at reducing viral load and indeed transmission of HIV among humans. One preferred variation on the models for testing the long-term clinical consequences of antiviral treatment is to use newborn macaques and treat from birth onward, in some cases more than a decade (Van Rompay et al., 2008). Unfortunately, however, successes in NHP studies do not always translate to success in humans, as seen with the recent STEP study which used an adenovirus-based vaccine approach (Buchbinder et al., 2008). Vaccinated humans were not protected and may have even been more susceptible to HIV, viremia was not reduced, and the infections were not attenuated as hoped. With regard to challenge route, IV exposure is more difficult to protect than mucosal exposure and is used as a \u201cworst case scenario.\u201d However, efficacy at one mucosal route is usually comparable to other mucosal routes.",

There are over 100 human papillomaviruses, with different strains causing warts on the skin, oropharynx, nasopharynx, larynx, and anogenital tissues. Approximately one third of papillomaviruses are transmitted sexually. Of these, virulent subtypes, such as HPV-16, HPV-18, HPV-31, HPV-33, and HPV-45 place individuals at high risk for cervical and other cancers. Up to 35% of head and neck cancers are caused by HPV-16, particularly oropharyngeal cancers. Major challenges in the study of these viruses are that papillomaviruses generally do not infect any other species outside of the natural hosts and can cause a very large spectrum of severity. Thus, no wild-type animal models have been identified that are susceptible to HPV. However, a number of useful surrogate models exist which use animal papillomaviruses in their natural host or a very closely related species (Borzacchiello et al., 2009, Brandsma, 1994, Campo, 2002). These models have facilitated the recent development of useful and highly effective prophylactic HPV vaccines (Rabenau et al., 2005).",

Transgenic mice used for HPV animal modeling typically express the viral oncogenes E5, E6, E7, or the entire early region of HPV-16 from the keratin 14 promoter which is only active in the basal cells of the mouse epithelium (Chow, 2015). Cancers in these models develop upon extended estrogen exposure (Maufort et al., 2010, Ocadiz-Delgado et al., 2009, Stelzer et al., 2010, Thomas et al., 2011). Transgenic mice with constitutively active Wnt/B-catenin signaling in cervical epithelial cells expressing the HPB oncoprotein E7 develop invasive cervical squamous carcinomas (Bulut and Uren, 2015). The tumors occur within 6 months approximately 94% of the time. Another model uses C57BL/6 mice expressing the HPV16-E7 transgene which are then treated topically with 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) (De Azambuja et al., 2014).

Most of the clinical features of human monkeypox are very similar to those of ordinary smallpox (Breman and Arita, 1980). After a 7- to 21-day-incubation period, the disease begins with fever, malaise, headache, sore throat, and cough. The main sign of the disease that distinguishes monkeypox from smallpox is swollen lymph nodes (lymphadenitis), which is observed in most of the patients before the development of rash (Di Giulio and Eckburg, 2004, Je\u00e9zek and Fenner, 1988). A typical maculopapular rash follows the prodromal period, generally lasting 1\u20133 days. The average size of the skin lesions are 0.5\u20131 cm and the progress of lesions follows the order: macules, papules, vesicles, pustules, umblication then scab, and desquamation and lasts typically 2\u20134 weeks. The fatality rate is 10% among the unvaccinated population and death generally occurs during the 2nd week of the disease (Je\u00e9zek and Fenner, 1988, Nalca et al., 2005).",

Studies using IN, IP, and ID routes of exposure showed that MPXV was highly infectious to prairie dogs, IP infection with the West African MPXV strain caused a more severe disease and 100% mortality than challenge by the IN route. Anorexia and lethargy were common signs of the disease for both exposure routes. In contrast to IP route, the IN route of exposure caused severe pulmonary edema and necrosis of lungs in prairie dogs, while splenic necrosis and hepatic lesions were observed in IP-infected animals (Xiao et al., 2005). Hutson et al. (2009) utilized IN and ID infections with West African and Congo basin strains and showed that both strains and routes caused smallpox-like disease with longer incubation periods and most importantly generalized pox lesions. Therefore, this model has the utility for testing therapeutics and vaccines against pox viruses. Furthermore, MPXV challenged prairie dogs were used to perform in vivo bioluminescent imaging (BLI) studies (Falendysz et al., 2015).

Considering the limited availability of prairie dogs, ground squirrels and African dormice, lack of reagents specific for these species, and not having commercial sources of these species, these small animal models are as attractive for further characterization and vaccine, and countermeasure testing studies.",

During our studies using an aerosol route of exposure, we observed that macaques had mild anorexia, depression, fever, and lymphadenopathy on day 6 postexposure (Nalca et al., 2010). Complete blood count and clinical chemistries showed abnormalities similar to human monkeypox cases with leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia (Huhn et al., 2005). Whole blood and throat swabs had viral loads peak around day 10, and in survivors, gradually decrease until day 28 postexposure. Since doses of 4 \u00d7 104 pfu, 1 \u00d7 105 pfu, or 1 \u00d7 106 pfu resulted in lethality for 70% of the animals, whereas a dose of 4 \u00d7 105 pfu resulted in 85% lethality, survival was not dose dependent. The main pitfall of this model was the lack of pox lesions. With the high dose, animals succumbed to disease before developing pox lesions. With the low challenge dose, pox lesions were observed but they were few in comparison to the IV model. A recent study also evaluated the cytokine levels in aerosol challenged animals. (Tree et al., 2015). Tree et al. (2015) showed that IFN\u03b3, IL-1r\u03b1, and IL-6 increased dramatically on day 8 postexposure the day that death was most likely to occur, and viral DNA was detected in most of the tissues. These results support the idea of a cytokine storm causing mortality in monkeypox disease.",

Of those infected, less than 5% will develop the chronic form of the disease. Chronicity is the most serious outcome of the disease as it can result in cirrhosis or liver cancer. Hepatocellular carcinoma is 100 times more likely to develop in a chronically infected individual than a noncarrier (Beasley, 1988).

Liver chimeric mouse models are an additional set of surrogate models for HBV infection (Dandri and Lutgehetmann, 2014). In these models human hepatocytes are integrated into the murine liver parenchyma (Allweiss and Dandri, 2016). This model might be used to test antivirals as well as to study the molecular biology of HBV infection.",

The woodchuck hepatitis virus induces hepatocellular carcinoma (Summers et al., 1978). Within a population, 65%\u201375% of all neonatal woodchucks are susceptible to chronic infection (Cote et al., 2000). A major difference between the two hepatitis isolates is the rate at which they induce cancer; almost all chronic carriers developed hepatocellular carcinoma within 3 years of the initial infection in woodchucks, whereas human carcinogenesis takes much longer (Gerin et al., 1989). The acute infection strongly resembles what occurs during the course of human disease. There is a self-limiting acute phase resulting in a transient viremia that has the potential of chronic carriage (Tennant, 2001). Challenge with virus in neonates leads to a chronic infection while adults only develop the acute phase of disease (Buendia, 1992). A closely related species to the woodchuck is the Marmota himalayan. This animal is also susceptible to the woodchuck hepadna virus upon IV injection. The marmot Himalayan develops an acute hepatitis with a productive infection (Lucifora et al., 2010).",

There are two modes of infection possible between the viruses: coinfection where a person is simultaneously infected or superinfection in which a chronic carrier of HBV is subsequently infected with HDV (Purcell et al., 1987). Coinfection leads to a similar disease as seen with HBV alone; however, superinfection can result in chronic HDV infection and severe liver damage (Guilhot et al., 1994). Both coinfection and superinfection can be demonstrated within the chimpanzee and woodchuck by inoculation of human hepatitis D (Ponzetto et al., 1991). A recently published report demonstrated the use of a humanized chimeric uPA mouse to study interactions between the two viruses and drug testing (Lutgehetmann et al., 2012)",

            "text": "New models ranging from NHPs to small animals and representing the disease characteristics in humans are necessary to study viral and host factors that drive disease pathogenesis and evaluate medical countermeasures. The ideal animal model for human viral disease should closely recapitulate the spectrum of clinical symptoms and pathogenesis observed during the course of human infection. Whenever feasible, the model should use the same virus and strain that infects humans. It is also preferable that the virus is a low passage clinical isolate thus animal passage or adaptation should be avoided if model species can be identified that are susceptible. Ideally, the experimental route of infection would mirror that occurs in natural disease. In order to understand the interplay and contribution of the immune system during infection, an immunocompetent animal should be used. The aforementioned characteristics cannot always be satisfied; however, and often virus must be adapted, knockout mice must be used, and/or the disease is not perfectly mimicked in the animal model. Well-characterized animal models are critical for licensure to satisfy FDA \u201cAnimal Rule.\u201d This rule applies to situations in which vaccine and therapeutic efficacy cannot safely or ethically be tested in humans; thus licensure will come only after preclinical tests are performed in animal models. Many fields in virology are moving toward standardized models that can be used across institutions to test vaccines and therapeutics. A current example of such an effort is within the filovirus community, where animal models, euthanasia criteria, assays, and virus strains are in the process of being standardized. The hope is that these efforts will enable results of efficacy tests on medical countermeasures compared across institutions. This chapter has summarized the best models available for each of the viruses described.",
