The 3C pro catalytic site is the target of numerous replication inhibitors. This paper describes the first structural model of a complex between a picornaviral 3C pro and a region of the 5 0 -UTR, stem-loop D (SLD). Using human rhinovirus as a model system, we have combined NMR contact information, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data, and previous mutagenesis results to determine the shape, position and relative orientation of the 3C pro and SLD components. The results clearly identify a 1:1 binding stoichiometry, with pronounced loops from each molecule providing the key binding determinants for the interaction. Binding between SLD and 3C pro induces structural changes in the proteolytic active site that is positioned on the opposite side of the protease relative to the RNA/protein interface, suggesting that subtle conformational changes affecting catalytic activity are relayed through the protein.",

This 3C pro -3D pol bi-protein binds via the 3C pro segment to the untranslated 5 0 -end of the genomic RNA, generally stem-loop D (SLD; Fig. 2A ) from the first cloverleaf.

Typically, a 50 mL overnight growth of E. coli BL21 CodonPlus cells containing the HMBP-3C plasmid was used to inoculate 1 L of LB containing chloramphenicol and ampicillin. This construct produces a histidine-tagged MBP fusion with 3C pro that can be cleaved with thrombin . When absorbance at 600 nm reached approximately 1.0 the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3800 rpm (GS3 rotor) and resuspended in 500 mL of M9 minimal medium supplemented with 3.5 g of 13 C-glucose and 0.5 g of 15 N-ammonium chloride. After 30 min at 30\u00b0C, induction was initiated by the addition of 0.5 mM isopropyl b-D-galactopyranoside (IPTG). For production of deuterated protein, the M9 minimal medium utilised D 2 O with either 2 H, 13 C-glucose or 2 H, 12 C-glycerol as a carbon source.",

A total of 30 U of bovine thrombin (Roche) was added to the eluted fraction and this was dialyzed against 1 L of aqueous buffer containing 20 mM Tris, 1 mM DTT and 0.5 mM EDTA at pH 7.8 (buffer B) for 8 h with a change of buffer at 4 h.

Data reduction to I(q) vs. q (where q = (4psinh)/k, 2h is the scattering angle and k = 1.54 \u00c5, the wavelength of the radiation) and solvent subtractions were performed with the program SAXS-quant1D (Anton Paar, Austria), while subsequent desmearing calculations were performed with the program GNOM (Semenyuk and Svergun, 1991) . Radius of gyration (R g ) and zero-angle scattering (I(0)) values were initially estimated by means of Guinier analysis (Guinier and Fournet, 1955) with the program PRIMUS (Konarev et al., 2003) . The programs GNOM and GIFT were used to calculate indirect Fourier transforms of I(q) to give P(r) vs. r and associated values for I(0), R g , and maximum dimension (D max ).

This program uses multiple scattering profiles to restore the shapes of complexes and differentiate between subunits possessing different scattering densities. In the present case, a strong contrast occurs between SLD and 3C pro due to the electron-dense phosphate backbone of the RNA. Input data for each MONSA calculation included both of the smoothed, desmeared I(q) profiles generated from GNOM for the 3C pro -SLD complex and 3C pro . The R g constraints in these calculations were derived from the SAXS data for 3C pro and the 3C pro -SLD complex. As SLD alone showed a tendency to dimerize under these experimental conditions, we used a theoretical R g constraint for that component calculated from the coordinates of the SLD NMR structure (Headey et al., 2006) . The results of 10 independent MONSA calculations were averaged and evaluated with the program DAMAVER to generate a consensus envelope for the entire complex and identify the relative positions of its protein and RNA subunits. The mean normalized spatial discrepancy between corresponding subunits in each model was 0.45 \u00b1 0.01 and 0.51 \u00b1 0.01 for 3C pro and SLD, respectively, indicating that all restored shape solutions were very similar.",

These SLD structures differ primarily in the details of the triloop conformation. Ten independent calculations were performed for each combination of 3C pro and one of the SLD structures. The SLD component was constrained to have at least one nucleotide within 10 \u00c5 of the C a atom of the 3C pro residues strongly implicated in RNAbinding by at least two of the following criteria: mutagenesis, NMR chemical shift perturbation, NMR signal loss, or signal doubling. This distance constraint was set to 20 \u00c5 for more moderately implicated residues to allow for the possibility that residues not directly in contact with the binding interface region may be affected by binding, but typically to a lesser extent. The best model was selected based on the fit to the scattering data as determined by the minimum v 2 value, which for an ideal fit is 1.0. The best-fit model was energy minimized in CNS (Br\u00fcnger et al., 1998) to relieve steric clashes.",

The experimental R g value for 3C pro derived from its P(r) agrees with the theoretical value from the NMR structure (16.7 \u00c5, calculated using the program CRY-SOL (Svergun and Nierhaus, 2000) ). In contrast, the SLD molecular weight determined from I(0) was approximately twice the expected value indicating that under our experimental conditions SLD is not a monomer in solution. Nonetheless, a 1:1 3C pro -SLD complex of the expected molecular weight was formed by mixing equimolar amounts of 3C pro to SLD (Supplementary Table 1) , which is consistent with the NMR results. Two types of structural models were generated for the 3C pro -SLD complex. First, the molecular envelope for the 3C pro -SLD complex was generated through ab initio shape restoration. As the protein and RNA components of the complex have different contrasts this enables the determination of the relative position of 3C pro and SLD within the total molecular envelope. The envelope is shown as a transparent surface in Fig. 7A and fits the scattering data with a statistically ideal v 2 value of 1.00 (Fig. 6B) . This envelope has dimensions of approximately 80 \u00c5 \u00c2 50 \u00c5 \u00c2 50 \u00c5 with the SLD component extending away from the surface of the 3C pro at an angle of $30\u00b0. Independent from ab initio shape restoration, an atomic model for the complex was calculated from the NMR-derived structures for 3C pro and SLD through rigid-body refinement. These rigid-body calculations were combined with previously derived NMR contact information to constrain the relative orientations between the subunits. The atomic model of the complex is shown as ribbons in Fig. 7A and fits the scattering data with a v 2 value of 1.26, which is good but somewhat higher than ideal. This discrepancy may be the result of small differences between the actual conformation of SLD and/or 3C pro in the complex compared with the corresponding structures used for the calculation, which were de- (Fig. 4D) , scaled from white (little change) to red (large change).

Residues with significant increase in peak intensity are shown in yellow, while residues for which no peak was observed in the HSQC-TROSY spectrum are shown in grey. Dark blue indicates positions of multiple HSQC-TROSY peaks (Fig. 3B ). In the left-hand view of parts A and B, the RNA-binding surface is shown. The right-hand views depict the catalytic face.

Indeed, the predicted scattering profile for the 3C pro component of the complex fits the scattering data for uncomplexed 3C pro relatively poorly (v 2 = 1.44), and provides further evidence that the 3C pro undergoes a small conformational change upon forming a complex with SLD.",

No residues from the C-terminal b-barrel make direct contact with SLD in this model. On the SLD molecule, nucleotides from uracil-13 to uracil-17 form contacts with the protein. This stretch includes the triloop and two bases, guanine-16 and uracil-17, from the 3 0 -side of stem II. Interestingly, the 31 P chemical shift values of guanine-16 and uracil-17 in the uncomplexed SLD are atypical, indicating a significant departure from standard A-form geometry (Headey et al., 2006) . The intermolecular interface covers an area of 653 \u00c5 2 and lies within the range of typical RNA-protein interaction interface areas (Allain et al., 2000; Johnson and Donaldson, 2006) . The SLD also closely approaches the loop that connects bstrands 2 and 3 (H31-R33). The H31-R33 loop is spatially positioned between residues R79-R84 of the inter-domain linker and the C-terminus of the protein. The N-terminal a-helix may become sufficiently mobile to approach the nearby SLD stem region, possibly explaining the loss of the corresponding peaks in the 3CIR NMR spectra if the association is transient or heterogeneous. Both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions play a role in complex formation. In addition to R84, other basic residues near the binding surface that may contact the SLD phosphodiester backbone include R12, K13, R33, R79 and K82. The F6, F83 and F89 residues are exposed in the uncomplexed protease and may stabilize the interaction via hydrophobic interactions such as base stacking. In the present model, the highly conserved F83 is particularly well situated for interaction with the triloop bases. The V49, L77 and I86 side chains could make additional hydrophobic contacts, as may the aliphatic regions of the many lysine and arginine residues in the area.",

            "text": "RNA-protein interactions are by their very nature diverse due to the variety of secondary and tertiary structures that each of these biopolymers is capable of adopting. The 3C pro tertiary structure does not appear to fit neatly into one of the previously defined classes of RNA-binding domains. However, some commonalities are apparent. For instance, we have shown that the linker connecting the two b-barrel domains of 3C pro , which lacks regular secondary structure and is likely to possess some degree of mobility, is a key to the interaction with SLD. Proteins containing the most prolific RNA-binding domain, dubbed simply the RNA-binding domain (RBD) or RNA recognition motif (RRM), often use the flexible linker between tandem RBDs to contact a flexible region of RNA (Allain et al., 2000; Wang et al., 2001) . After complex formation, each of these flexible regions changes conformation, typically becoming more highly ordered (Bouvet et al., 2001) . This raises the possibility that a conformational change and an increase in rigidity may occur in the 3C pro linker and SLD triloop. This potential rearrangement could, among other effects, help translocate the F89 aromatic ring of the connecting linker into closer contact with SLD. In addition, RBD domains possess two or three solvent-exposed aromatic bases which can form contacts with the RNA bases (Birney et al., 1993) . This is consistent with the potential involvement of the exposed F83, F89 and F6 residues from 3C pro , although the effects at F6 may simply be due to an overall shift in the position of the N-terminal a-helix. Precedence here comes from the U1A-UTR complex (Oubridge et al., 1995; Varani et al., 2000) , in which the U1A C-terminal a-helix shifts position to allow the RNA UTR fragment more complete access to the RNA-binding sheet beneath.",

Ideal Aform RNA contains a deep and narrow major groove which precludes the possibility of specific recognition of the base pairs within. The minor groove side provides greater access, but the bases present an essentially uniform, non-sequence-specific face in the minor groove. Specific recognition of bases must occur via the major groove. RNA stem loops containing non-canonical base pairs can present a widened major groove, as has been shown for HRV-14 SLD (Headey et al., 2006) and in other instances (Du et al., 2004; Ohlenschl\u00e4ger et al., 2004) . Thus, contacts between the stem region closest to the triloop and the protease may benefit from the presence of the non-canonical base pairs further up the stem. The contacts between the triloop bases and 3C pro are somewhat analogous to the binding of the sex-lethal protein to a nonpaired uracil-rich tract from the drosophila transformer mRNA precursor (Handa et al., 1999) . The transformer uracil-rich tract is extended but ordered, including stable sugar puckers in the atypical C2 0 -endo configuration. Thus it is interesting to note that each sugar of the uracil-rich stretch of implicated SLD nucleotides (uracil-13 to uracil-17) primarily adopts a C2 0 -endo configuration (Headey et al., 2006) . In summary, while the global fold of 3C pro may be distinct from other RNA-binding proteins investigated to date, the mechanisms of interaction may be largely conserved.",

Mutational work in which stem I adenine \u00c1 uracil pairs were replaced with guanine \u00c1 cytosine pairs suggests that this conservation is necessary to retain the ability to bind 3C pro (Walker et al., 1995) . This would seem at odds with the model (Fig. 7A) , in which the triloop and stem II regions contact 3C pro . On the other hand, NMR shift perturbation data for a coxsackie virus 3C pro -SLD interaction (Ohlenschl\u00e4ger et al., 2004) suggest that the triloop and the nearby stem II elements contact the protein (Fig. 7B ). Although 3C pro from HRV-14 can bind SLD from other picornaviral species, the opposite is not necessarily true. For example, coxsackie virus 3C pro is unable to bind HRV-14 SLD. Evidence suggests that this disparity is due to the presence of a triloop in HRV-14 SLD vs. a tetraloop in most other picornaviral SLD (Zell et al., 2002) . These results implicate the triloop region in binding. The somewhat contradictory data regarding stem I could suggest that alterations close to the chain termini influence the global fold or stability of SLD, affecting the binding at the triloop end. That is, shape, rather than contact recognition of the specific bases in stem I, may be the key determining factor (e.g. Rieder et al., 2003; Zell et al., 2002) . Sequence conservation in stem I could also reflect, to some degree, other interactions/ activities that are not well characterized at present.",

Perturbation of this loop appears to occur via direct interactions with the RNA triloop through the 79-84 loop, or in a supporting role for this loop. The 151-156 loop is partially conserved at the G154 (50%) and K155 (70%) positions and contains 100% hydrophobic residues at the 156 and 157 positions. Changes induced in this loop may be more indirect in nature, as SLD does not closely approach these residues in the present model.

In the context of the 3C/VPg/oriI complex, a binding mechanism has been proposed that includes a 3C dimerization event Shen et al., 2008) , supported by cross-linking studies and crystal contacts of uncomplexed poliovirus 3C pro (Mosimann et al., 1997 ) though a previous study found no evidence of dimerization (Xiang et al., 1998) . NMR data from 3C pro interactions with single-stranded 11-mer RNA sequences derived from the poliovirus oriI element (Amero et al., 2008) were combined with the above theory to propose that a poliovirus 3C pro dimer binds to two sites on an unwound oriI element.",

            "text": "In the present study, we see no evidence of 3C pro dimerization, and in fact the SAXS data is only consistent with the formation of a 1:1 3C pro :SLD complex. Furthermore, although the bases of the SLD triloop region are unpaired, we see no evidence of significant disruption of base-pairing in the HRV-14 SLD stem regions upon complex formation. These discrepancies with previous models may reflect differences in 3C pro interactions with oriI vs. oriL or perhaps differences between poliovirus and HRV replication mechanisms. While overlapping regions of the 3C pro surface from poliovirus and HRV are clearly involved in interaction with single-stranded oligomers derived from the poliovirus oriI element and with the intact HRV-14 oriL, respectively, the mode of interaction may thus differ in other aspects. Along these lines, note that substitution of the poliovirus oriI element into HRV yields a chimera unable to uridylate VPg (Shen et al., 2007) . Note also that the 3C pro N-terminal a-helix amide chemical shifts were assigned in the poliovirus 3C pro -oriI study, suggesting that the characteristics or role of the N-terminal helix may differ in poliovirus vs. HRV-14 or in binding single vs. double-stranded RNA molecules. Each of these possibilities would be consistent with the suggestion that the HRV-14 Nterminal helix may interact directly with the SLD stem region. Furthermore, a recent crystallographic study of the 3C pro -3D pol fusion protein from poliovirus (Marcotte et al., 2007) positions the covalently linked 3D pol in close contact with the C-terminal region of 3C pro . This orientation of 3D pol , if conserved in HRV-14, would not interfere with the SLD-3C pro contacts as determined in the present study. The 3D pol position does, however, conflict with the poliovirus 3C pro dimer contacts used in the previous models. It is possible that either the 3C pro -3C pro or 3C pro -3D pol contacts differ in vivo vs. in a crystal environment, or that poliovirus 3C pro dimerizes in this fashion only after proteolytic release of 3D pol . Further structural studies of 3C pro -3D pol in complex with SLD and with larger fragments of the 5 0 -UTR or oriI elements, along with quantitative analyses of RNA-induced effects on 3C pro catalytic activity, will help to further delineate the molecular mechanism of genomic replication in picornaviruses and perhaps shed light on the intricate mechanisms linking replication events.
