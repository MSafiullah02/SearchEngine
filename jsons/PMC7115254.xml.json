            "text": "The treatment goals for acute RS are to eliminate infection when present, improve ostiomeatal patency as a means of restoring ventilation, promote drainage, reduce inflammation, and relieve symptoms, including pain and nasal congestion [17], [19]. Intranasal corticosteroids (INSs), with their recognized anti-inflammatory properties, have been shown to be effective in reducing mucosal swelling and improving sinus drainage, thereby hastening the elimination of pathogens [5], [19]. Consequently, the Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters for Allergy and Immunology recommends combining an INS with an antibiotic (mainly amoxicillin/potassium clavulanate) for the symptomatic treatment of recurrent acute or chronic RS. The Joint Task Force also notes that INS monotherapy may be helpful in patients with acute and chronic RS [5]. Similarly, the European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology recommends INS therapy, either alone or as an adjunct to an antibiotic, for the treatment of moderate and severe RS [8].",

Those effects are thought to result from inhibition of the release of proinflammatory mediators, such as adhesion molecules, cytokines, mast cells, basophils, and eosinophils [21]. By binding to the glucocorticoid receptor in the cytoplasm, the glucocorticoid molecule of an INS produces a complex that acts on a variety of transcriptional activities, leading to reductions in levels of proinflammatory molecules and cells (Table 2\n) [21], [22], [23], [24]. In acute RS, INSs have been shown to reduce the inflammation associated with symptoms such as congestion, headache, and facial pain [21], [25].",

The intranasal route of administration delivers drug directly to the target organ, allowing local therapeutic concentrations because of the high affinity of the agents for the glucocorticoid receptor. Approximately 30% of the administered dose is deposited in the nose, where it binds with the glucocorticoid receptor, while the remaining 70% is swallowed. The swallowed drug is subject to hepatic first-pass metabolism, which is about 90% with BUD and TAA, 2 agents with relatively lower lipophilicity (or lipid-partitioning potential), and 99% with MF and FP, which have higher lipophilicity [40]. The rank order of some of the currently available INSs according to lipophilicity (highest to lowest) is MF, FP, BDP, BUD, TAA, and FLU [41], [42].",

The main determinant of systemic bioavailability of these drugs is the amount directly absorbed from the lung or nose, which does not undergo first-pass hepatic inactivation as does most of the swallowed portion of the dose [40]. As shown in Table 3\n, the estimated absolute bioavailability of an intranasal dose is highest with compounds with greater water solubility (eg, BUD and FLU, with 34% and 49% absolute bioavailability, respectively) [43], [45], [46] and lowest with the less water-soluble, more lipophilic agents (eg, FP with <1% and MF with <0.1% absolute bioavailability) [43], [45], [47], [48]. In a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-way, cross-over study in 15 healthy subjects, MF and FP (both administered at the higher than indicated doses of 400 \u03bcg/d for 4 days) produced mean peak plasma concentrations that were slightly above the assay's lower limit of detection [49].",

An excessive level of systemic glucocorticoids would reduce the endogenous production of cortisol, which can be detected by evaluating basal HPA activity. Measurements of HPA function, such as area-under-the-curve cortisol concentrations and urinary free cortisol excretion, are considered the most sensitive indicators of INS systemic bioavailability. Stimulation tests of HPA-axis function, such as tests that measure serum cortisol levels after the administration of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) or cosyntropin, are not as sensitive in identifying the systemic bioavailability of the INSs, but they predict the likelihood of AEs more accurately [43], [50], [51]. Corticosteroids also may inhibit linear bone growth [52], an effect that has been assessed in short-term studies using knemometry (a precise measurement of lower-leg growth) [50], [53], [54] and surrogate markers of bone formation (eg, osteocalcin) [43], as well as in long-term studies using whole-body stadiometry [43], [50], [51].",

Those findings contrast with a knemometry study conducted with MF in 22 children (aged 7\u201312 years) with AR. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 4-way crossover study, no significant differences were observed in lower-leg growth rates in children treated for 2 weeks with once-daily MF 100 \u03bcg or 200 \u03bcg, BUD 400 \u03bcg, or placebo [71].

Reported AEs have been primarily local (eg, epistaxis and headache), generally classified as mild to moderate, and similar in incidence to that of placebo. Based on the results of clinical studies, concerns about possible systemic effects with intranasal use have not been justified. Studies that tested for INSs in the systemic circulation and possible effects arising from such exposure showed no evidence of HPA-axis suppression with administration of MF, FP, and BUD at doses as high as 400 \u03bcg twice daily for 4 weeks. Studies after administration of similar doses of MF, BUD, and FP to children for as long as 1 year showed no evidence of growth retardation. No clinically relevant systemic exposure resulting from intranasal administration of these agents was observed. For patients receiving an INS at the recommended dose, there appears to be little risk of HPA-axis suppression or disturbed bone metabolism. The mild side effect profile for newer agents such as MF, which is the only INS that has been studied as adjunctive therapy to antibiotics and as monotherapy for acute RS, appears to be related to their relatively low systemic bioavailability. Thus, physicians should feel confident in prescribing newer agents for long-term treatment of acute RS.",
