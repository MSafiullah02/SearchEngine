The study subjects were able to see the particles move directly from the patient to the air and contaminate the environment as well as the subject's physical person (\nFig 1). The effectiveness of PPE was demonstrated using a black light that showed areas of fluorescent powder contamination and areas in which PPE provided a barrier, thereby preventing contamination.",

The addition of a visual component to training emphasized the personal risk of the individual HCW. Direct observations showed that the subjects trained using this visual approach appropriately used PPE more often than those subjects whose training did not include this visual component: 74% versus 53%, respectively. Therefore, these results suggest that use of the biosimulator and visual training is an important new approach for learning in the health care setting. This type of learning allowed the HCW to see the impact of disease transmission as opposed to simply hearing about it through traditional didactic education. In addition, the components of this visual demonstration built on the principles of adult learning. Teaching occurred within the context of work experience, thereby making the learning relevant to the individual.",

Reducing the respiratory exposures because of influenza and preventing the repeated scenarios identified during the SARS 2003 global epidemic may also prevent the unnecessary illness/deaths of HCW because of inadequate or inappropriate use of respiratory PPE. Successful demonstration of improvements could change the way HCW education is conducted throughout a variety of environments, not simply the ED. Furthermore, this type of education could be used in other professional disciplines, including physician, therapist, and administrative training.",
