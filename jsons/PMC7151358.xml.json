Usually, RNAs viruses, including coronaviruses, are detected by endosomal TLR-3 and 7 and/or cytoplasmic RNA sensors RIG-I and MDA5. TLR-3 and -7 promote nuclear shuttling of transcription factors NF\u03baB and IRF3, while RIG-1/MDA5 ligation results in activation of IRF3. This triggers increased expression of type 1 interferons (T1IFN) (through IRF3) and other innate pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 through NF\u03baB) [6,7]. These induce an \u201canti-viral state\u201d and innate and adaptive immune cell responses which contribute to pathogen containment and clearance. Novel coronaviruses can escape these mechanisms by altering ubiquitination and degradation of the RIG-I/MDA5 adaptor molecule mitochondrial antiviral-signalling protein (MAVS), and inhibition of the nuclear translocation of IRF3 and TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAF)3 and 6 which induce NF\u03baB signalling [8]. Furthermore, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 can counteract T1IFN through inhibition of STAT transcription factor phosphorylation [7].",
