The antibody has murine light-and heavy-chain variable regions and human constant region sequences. Rituximab was developed from the fully murine parent ibritumomab, which recognizes the same epitope. The basic effector mechanisms of this antibody are related to the Fc portion, and include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) resulting from C1q binding, and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), mediated by one or more of the Fcc receptors at the surface of granulocytes, macrophages, and NK cells. However, rituximab is also able to induce cell death via apoptosis, yet it is not clear which of these potential aggressive mechanisms are prevalent/effective in vivo. Administration of rituximab induces a rapid and massive destruction of circulating and tissue-based normal and malignant B cells. In some studies, depletion was evaluated by assessing the presence of residual B cells by another marker (CD19) and resulted being over 95 %. However, rituximab has no effect on hemopoietic progenitor cells and T cells. In hematologic malignancies, B cell depletion in circulation and in tissue localizations occurs within 3 weeks, and recovery begins in 6 months, reaching normal values within one year after treatment. In RA patients, there is an almost total depletion of circulating B cells within 2 weeks of treatment, lasting about 6 months and reaching normal levels within one year in most patients. A delayed recovery occurs, over 3 years after treatment, in a subgroup of subjects (4 %).",

            "text": "In a recent overview on anti-CD20 mAbs, five mechanisms of action were recognized, and the therapeutic mAbs were grouped according to their capacity to induce the reorganization of CD20 molecules into lipid rafts upon binding [10] . In particular, Type I antibodies induce the formation of lipid rafts and efficiently activate the classical pathway of the complement system, while Type II antibodies do not translocate CD20 into lipid drafts, yet induce cell death upon direct binding, and poorly activate complement. Both types are capable of inducing ADCC in the presence of effector cells. Rituximab is a Type I mAb and expresses the cytolytic action mainly by ADCC via FccR-expressing monocyte/macrophages, while CDC may play an additional role. In contrast, Type II mAbs, such as tositumomab, mostly act by direct apoptosis. These cytolytic functions may be differently expressed in various situations, being CDC more effective in circulation, where complement factors are highly represented, than on a solid tumor mass. Moreover, their efficacy varies in dependence of the tumor burden. In this case, multiple events are expected to be necessary in the presence of significant tumor masses. Further mechanisms are involved during therapy, such as the opsonization of mAb-covered targets mostly occurring as late effect. CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and is not endocytosed during the antibody binding [8] . However, Type I mAbs can be internalized when bound to some FccR, more than Type II mAbs. As for rituximab, the internalization requires the cross-link between the Fc tail to FccRIIb, an ITIM-containing inhibitory receptor, and the Fab portion to CD20 on the same target cell. This mechanism is crucial in reducing therapeutic efficiency; it lowers the available amount of mAb at the target cell surface, necessary for effector cells recruiting, and drags the rituximab-CD20 complex into lysosomes for degradation. Interestingly, the expression of FccRIIb on different targets correlates with resistance to rituximab while the presence of FccRIIIa, the ITAM-containing stimulatory receptor, is related to mAb efficacy [11] .",

In particular, homozygous valine in the position 158 exerts higher ADCC capacity with respect to heterozygous or homozygous phenylalanine alternatives in the same position. About 49 different FccRIIIa phenotypes have been identified in NHL patients showing differences in therapy response. Similarly, a correlation between B cell depletion induced by rituximab and receptor phenotype has been shown in SLE patients. Another mechanism potentially capable of influencing the therapeutic response is related to the rituximab-induced downregulation of IL-10 that enhances apoptosis and synergize with chemotherapeutic and steroid agents on the target [12] . Finally, rituximab seems to increase the number of Treg lymphocytes and prevents the activity of specific autoreactive T cells. These two additional mechanisms support in principle the administration of rituximab in autoimmune diseases. Overall, rituximab shows multiple and complex functions, which may explain the different target sensitivities and safety profiles under various clinical conditions. These mechanisms are shared with other anti-CD20 mAbs, but their efficiency is expressed with a different hierarchy among them. In fact, clinical experience indicates that cases of noncross-reactive resistance and synergistic effects between anti-CD20 mAbs and chemotherapy occur, and are possibly related to mechanistic diversities (see also Chap. 23, 29, 37).",

The RA safety profile was based on 3,100 patients from clinical trials receiving at least one cycle of rituximab in combination with MTX, and followed from 6 months up to over 5 years. On this basis, and considering postmarketing data so far accumulated, a general safety profile of rituximab has been depicted, reporting most relevant and occurring AEs. Moreover, some peculiarities encountered in each treated disease have also been reported.",

A peculiar drug-related AE is referred as hyperviscosity syndrome, caused by a transient increase of serum IgM levels, which usually almost returns to baseline level within 4 months. The syndrome is commonly expressed by local hemorrhage (epistaxis, gingival and retinal episodes), dizziness, and fatigue. The general safety profile in chemotherapy-associated treatment of Waldenstrom's disease is within the range of other lymphomas and includes hematologic (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia) and nonhematologic signs (infusion reactions, constitutional signs, arrhythmias, etc.). In a recent study on 43 patients treated with multiple cycles of rituximab, fludrocortisone and cyclophosphamide, infusion reactions (49 %) were mostly mild and associated to first administration. One of them was severe and associated with rash. Major events included anemia (30 %), neutropenia (12 %), thrombocytopenia (3 %), nausea/vomiting (21 %), arrhythmia (5 %), dyspnea (2 %), biliary/liver dysfunction (2 %), and polyuria (2 %). Hyperviscosity syndrome was absent. However, there was at least one episode of severe neutropenia in about 88 % of patients during the study, and it was long lasting in 44 % of them.

In a wide overview of the past 12 years publications, 272 patients in 42 studies received rituximab either with the NHL protocol (180) or with RA protocol (92). Interestingly, the former was less effective and produced less serious infections, but higher mortality, while the RA protocol was more effective, produced more infections, but with lower mortality rates. None produced sustained clinical remission. The overall major concern was the high infection rates, some of which were fatal. SAEs (16.6 %) associated to the NHL protocol in 48 patients included two cases of pneumonia (P. Carinii, one fatal), and single cases of septic shock (fatal), multi-bacterial sepsis, bacterial pneumonia, DVT/pulmonary embolism, hip arthritis (P. Aeruginosa), and gastritis/retinitis (CMV). Two late-onset neutropenias, one severe and one associated to bacterial pneumonia, were observed after 19-27 weeks from treatment. Seven case series on 88 subjects reported SAEs in 2.3 % of patients, including one septicemia (fatal) and one pyelonephritis.",

However, one apparent concern was about the long-term depleting effect on these cells, since B cell recovery was not complete after 90 days postdose [1] . After about 15 years of clinical experience, rituximab has confirmed the expectancies and remains a manageable biomedicine, mainly when compared to alternative therapies for the same indicated diseases. The lack of serious long-term toxicity and of myelosuppressive effects, although massively depleting the B cell compartment without interfering with the stem cell compartment, remains the most valuable characteristic of this mAb. However, anemia and thrombocytopenia are among the encountered drug-related AEs.",

However, recent experience is showing that genetic polymorphism of Fc receptors may explain differences in efficacy and safety, and possibly enlighten the progressive resistance to therapy observed with this drug, mainly when used as monotherapy [10] . The intervention of different mechanisms of action may also be involved in diversity of expressions at local level, both in efficacy and safety, as well as in early versus late interventions. For example, CDC is more likely to cause early events in circulation, while internalization of rituximab-CD20 complexes may led to resistance episodes and more persistent late events. On the other hand, they also explain some enhancing and synergic effects of rituximab, when associated with chemotherapy and/or other monoclonals, through mechanisms of sensitization of the targets.",
