RT-PCR is a laboratory technique combining reverse transcription of ribonucleic acid to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and the amplification of disease-specific DNA targets using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In acute respiratory infections, RT-PCR is used to detect viruses from respiratory secretions. The use of this technology to develop a simple, rapid, and robust detection capability with minimal training and lab experience or infrastructure has been demonstrated during previous international health emergencies such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).5",

A strategy of Rapid Isolation and Treatment of Ebola using the Liberia Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW), supported by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), WHO, and other agencies in Liberia began to respond systematically to suspected cases in remote areas in August 2014.3 This rapid response concept, when instituted in later outbreaks, was one of the factors that helped contain the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the DRC in May 2017. Teams that are competently and confidently trained in RT-PCR, personal protective equipment (PPE) protocols, and mobile laboratory capabilities provide a valuable resource by confirming cases quickly and efficiently. Follow-up interventions are then deployed in a manner such that treatment, isolation/quarantine efforts, and other response and mitigation efforts are more effective and focused.",

The mobile lab is one such resource that is readily deployable, cost effective, and provides a safe containment platform for rapid on-scene diagnostic capabilities. The sampling and testing methods are not dependent on shipping the samples to a reference lab, thus speeding up diagnostic turnaround in LMICs or regions of the world that lack such labs. The current pandemic has identified an additional gap with regard to labs. It seems that even when labs are available, they can be quickly overwhelmed by the increased number of samples. This proposed model could be easily implemented with confidence and minimal training based on accepted protocols and past experience.",
