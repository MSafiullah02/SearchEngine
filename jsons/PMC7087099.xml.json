A pathogenic role for HRV in the lower respiratory tract has been reported, particularly in immunocompromised patients, although studies are controversial, and very few data are available concerning lung transplant (LT) recipients [3\u20138]. The success of LT may be limited by many factors, including organ infection/disease and acute rejection (AR), which appears to be a harbinger of chronic graft dysfunction [9]. In a recent study, an HRV load of >1x105 RNA copies/ml in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid was associated with respiratory tract infection, while lower loads were detected in the absence of overt clinical symptoms [6]. An association between AR and persistent HRV infection has been described [10], whereas no association between HRV and new onset of chronic graft dysfunction was found in a recent study [11].",

A standard therapeutic regimen was given to all patients: long-term immunosuppression with cyclosporine or tacrolimus (in patients with cystic fibrosis), mycophenolate mofetil and prednisone (to be tapered at low dosage or discontinued); and antiviral prophylaxis with ganciclovir or valganciclovir (450 mg twice daily) from day 21 for 3 weeks, together with HCMV-IG assays (Cytotect Biotest) at days 1, 4, 8, 15, 30 (1.5 ml/kg body weight) and every month until 1 year (1 ml/kg body weight), irrespective of HCMV mismatching. Multiple BAL procedures were performed in 26 patients (mean, 4.5; range, 2-9). Histopathological analysis was done on surveillance transbronchial biopsies using H&E, Periodic acid-Schiff, and Masson\u2019s trichrome stains. AR and small-airway inflammation (lymphocytic bronchiolitis) were diagnosed according to the 2007 criteria of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation [12].\n",

Although this difference could be due to the fact that LT recipients are predisposed to viral infections of the lower respiratory tract, given the dysfunctional pulmonary background and altered local immunity, it is likely that the sampling frequency (surveillance at three month-intervals) contributes substantially to the higher rate of detection in LT recipients. This could also explain the lack of differences in prevalence when comparing HRV detection in specimens in contrast to the significant difference when considering patients. Nevertheless, the frequency of detection in LT patients did not imply a difference in viral load between the different subgroups.",

Similarly, a viral load of >1x105 was always associated with respiratory symptoms in immunocompetent adults, while lower levels did not appear to correlate with the kinetics of clinical symptoms. In our study, only one LT patient (viral load 106, HRV as a single agent) presented respiratory insufficiency, while all of the other HRV-positive LT recipients had a viral load of 103-104, also in the presence of clinical signs and/or symptoms, and similar loads were also detected in surveillance specimens, thus confirming the presence of HRV in the lower respiratory tract, although it should be considered that real-time PCR methods vary among different studies, and results cannot be extrapolated to all assays. It should be noted that LT recipients with a viral load of 103-104 copies/ml in the presence of symptoms were all coinfected, thus demonstrating the clinical role played by other respiratory agents. Clinical follow-up and sampling intervals excluded that the low level of virus present in the epithelial lining fluid was due to a previous infectious episode. In the other patients, HRV was detected frequently in co-infection with other viruses, and a viral load of >105 was invariably associated with overt clinical signs and/or symptoms, as expected.",

In a study on HRV detection in BAL from 68 LT recipients [10], Kaiser et al. described three patients with lower respiratory symptoms and graft dysfunction, two with AR and persistent infection over a 12-month period. In our study, AR was detected in 12 cases, three of which were HRV positive, although only one had a viral load of approximately 105 RNA copies/ml, with HRV detected as single agent, while the other two displayed viral loads of 103 and co-infections. In another LT recipient, respiratory insufficiency and chronic graft dysfunction were evidenced in association with HRV-positivity as single agent and a viral load >106. However, no case of persistent HRV detection was evidenced. These data, like those on LT recipients reported in literature, have to be considered taking into account the small numbers, thus preventing a definitive evaluation and suggesting the need for further studies.",

It could be hypothesized that the clinical evaluation of HRV in the context of LT should take the viral load into account, with levels of >105 RNA copies/ml BAL potentially being associated with overt clinical signs/symptoms, although lower levels of HRV can also be detected in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, and differences in real-time PCR assays should be considered. Considering the small number of positive specimens in the LT cohort and the large number of co-infections [20], no definitive conclusions can be made on this issue, and further studies on larger series are required. The association with AR and chronic graft dysfunction should be studied further, although it could be hypothesized that HRV, similar to other community-acquired respiratory viruses, contributes to the onset of a cascade of events that potentially lead to acute and chronic graft dysfunction.",
