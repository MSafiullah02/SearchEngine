Analogous to the known SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 utilize ACE2 as the entry point in the ACE2-expressing cells, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 share the similar life cycle with other SARS-CoV (4). It is important to highlight that S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds ACE2 with around from 10-to 20-fold greater attraction than S protein of SARS-CoV (5). This high affinity of S protein for human ACE2 probably has facilitate the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 in human populations.

The presence of multiple pre-existing comorbidities is related with more severe COVID-19 infection manifestation, reflecting the presence of pre-existent physical and/or cognitive frailty. It is now evident that the COVID-19 disease vulnerable and dying population encompasses the older persons and people with underlying medical conditions (such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, renal failure, respiratory diseases), which needs more attention and care (8, 9) . Recent evidences demonstrate that in Italy there is the highest proportion of older patients with COVID-19 disease and that the rate of older people may partially clarify the differences in the number of cases and in the case-fatality rates observed among countries. Overall, deaths for COVID-19 infection are largely detected among older, male patients who at the same time have multiple comorbidities.",

Thus, long-term care facilities need to have special precautions and protocols to defend residents, employees, and visitors. In this respect the role of geriatricians is crucial for the prompt identification, isolation and care of suspected and confirmed patients affected by COVID-19 disease. This early identification is essential to limit as much as possible the spread of infection among residents in the longterm care facilities.

Some evidences documented that it has potential antiviral properties enhancing endosomal pH needed for virus/cell fusion, as well as interfering with the glycosylation process of SARS-CoV cellular receptors (24) . Tocilizumab is a humanized antiinterleukin-6-receptor monoclonal antibody that inhibits interleukin-6 signaling used as treatment in rheumatoid arthritis. Tocilizumab is administered intravenous experimentally in the treatment of COVID-19 disease in China and now in Italy with some encouraging results (25) . However, the hypothesis that tocilizumab can restore T cell counts in COVID-19 disease patients, by suppressing IL-6 signal, is actually not fully explored (26) . Sarilumab is the other antiinterleukin-6-receptor monoclonal antibody drug that could be used to treat Covid-19 patients in order to reduce the pulmonary inflammation and to prevent the onset of respiratory distress. At present there is no scientific evidence even if in Italy Sarilumab is used experimentally in some patients. Future clinical investigations will help to better define the use of these agents.",

The geriatrician is the specialist who best can manage the multidimensional health problems of the older subjects, with a great aptitude and skill to cope multimorbid and complex patients (28) . Second, geriatricians are the doctors who best know the principles of teamwork and are able to adapt the protective measures (i.e., in long-term care and rehabilitation) according to the needs of the patients in close collaboration with the other health care professionals (i.e., head nurse, nurse, aid nurse, physiotherapist, occupation therapist) and family. The geriatrician is the doctor who can manage the environmental and social isolation imposed by the SARS-COV-2 infection. In particular, the geriatrician will be able to manage the onset of the most important geriatric syndromes, such as bed rest, sarcopenia, malnutrition, urinary incontinence and delirium (29, 30) . Finally, geriatricians can act as the \"sentinel\" for the best possible treatment based on the clinical and functional conditions and not only on the basis of age. For the healthcare system in all the countries, it will be essential as quickly as possible to plan for the increase in demand and to recognize how reconfigure services to cope. The COVID-19 pandemic disease has shown the problem of all health care service (31) . The high prevalence of older subjects in Wester countries puts the health and social systems in a catastrophic crisis because it decompensates for problems otherwise better overcome in younger people. The early assessment of these problems in the community and in longterm care settings can prevent these systemic crises and, as a consequence, a new and modern health care system based on integrated approach is mandatory. Moreover, it is important to plan the new hospital organization shifting healthcare resources and expertise, such as geriatricians, to treat and manage the old subjects who become seriously ill. Based on the Italian experience, the Gemelli against COVID-19 Geriatrics team strongly suggests to all the Countries that in the near future will face the same Italian situation, that the geriatric care teams must be integrated into the management of this SARS-CoV-2 infection crisis (32) .",
