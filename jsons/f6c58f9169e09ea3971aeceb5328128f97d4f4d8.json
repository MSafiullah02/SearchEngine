By contrast, when mTORC1 is inactive (during nutrient limitation or rapamycin treatment), ULK1 is released 18, 19 , which enables it to phosphorylate FIP200, translocate to the PAS and recruit other ATG proteins to initiate autophagosome formation [18] [19] [20] .

This is achieved by engaging PtdIns3-kinase class III (PtdIns3KC3; Vps34 in yeast), resulting in the production of PtdIns3P at the phagophore. This leads to the recruitment of PtdIns3P-binding proteins, such as WD-repeat domain phosphoinositide-interacting 1 (WIPI1; Atg18 in yeast) and WIPI2 (Atg21 in yeast) to the PAS to aid phagophore assembly by, at least in yeast, recruiting downstream Atg proteins (Atg16 and Atg8; see below) 25, 26 . ATG9 is also important for phagophore assembly. In yeast, Atg9 exits from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and associates with small vesicles 27, 28 , some of which contribute membranes, at least partially, for phago phore biogenesis 27, 28 . In mammals, ATG9 localizes at the TGN and on endosomes, transiently interacts with omegasomes and is required for PAS formation and expansion 29, 30 . However, ATG9 is not incorporated into the PAS.",

In addition, ATG12-ATG5 forms a complex with ATG16L1, which asso ciates with the expanding phagophore membrane 33 but is released from the autophagosome membrane when the vesicle is complete 32 . The fusion of ATG16L1associated precursor vesicles with each other is mediated by SNARE proteins and possibly contributes to the phagophore expansion process 34 . ATG12-ATG5 is necessary for the formation of the second ubiquitin-like conjugate, light chain 3 (LC3; also known as MAP1LC3B; Atg8 in yeast)-phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), which is activated by the E1-like enzyme ATG7 and the E2-like enzyme ATG3. The ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L1 complex directs LC3 to the target membrane 35 , where it becomes conjugated to PE by the E3-like enzyme activity of ATG12-ATG5 (REF. 36 ). The cysteine protease ATG4B is also required for LC3-PE formation, as it cleaves the carboxyl terminus of LC3 and exposes a glycine residue that is then covalently attached to PE 37 . In addition, ATG4B deconjugates a proportion of the LC3-PE complexes when autophagosome formation is complete, thus facilitating the recycling of LC3 for the formation of new autophagosomes 37, 38 . Recent studies in yeast indicate that this deconjugation process is necessary for efficient autophagosome biogenesis as well as for maturation of the autophagosome into a fusion-capable autophagosome 38, 39 . LC3 has been shown to mediate the hemifusion of vesicles and to control the size of the autophagosome in yeast 40, 41 . Eventually, autophagosomes mature into degradative autolysosomes by a series of fusion events with endosomes and lysosomes. In mammals, the fusion of an autophagosome with a lysosome requires the small GTPase RAB7 (Ypt7 in yeast) 42 , the autophagosomal SNARE protein syntaxin 17 (REF. 43) and the lysosomal SNARE vesicle-associated membrane protein 8 (VAMP8), as well as lysosomal membrane proteins, such as lysosomal-associated membrane glycoprotein 2 (LAMP2) 44, 45 . In yeast, the vesicle SNARE (v-SNARE) proteins vacuolar morphogenesis protein 7 (Vam7) and Ykt6, the target SNARE (t-SNARE) proteins Vam3 and Vti1, the GTPase Ypt7, the Ypt7 guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) monensin sensitivity 1-calciumcaffeine-zinc sensitivity 1 (Mon1-Ccz1) and homotypic vacuole fusion and vacuole protein sorting (HOPS) proteins 46 are all required for autophagosome fusion with the vacuole (which is the yeast counterpart of the lysosome). Lysosomal breakdown of the inner autophagosomal membrane and the autophagosome cargo is mediated by lysosomal hydrolases.",

Moreover, ubiquitin-associated cargoes are recognized by ubiquitin-binding protein adaptors, which also contain LIRs 50 .

Recent studies have identified alternative autophagy pathways that are independent of some of the core machinery components; these are known as non-canonical forms of On stimulation of autophagy, a small membrane sac, known as the phagophore, is assembled and starts to elongate to enclose cytoplasmic components. The phagophore expands and grows into a double-membrane compartment, known as the autophagosome, which sequesters cytoplasmic targets, such as proteins, organelles and microorganisms. The autophagosome fuses with the lysosome to generate the autolysosome, in which the cargo is degraded by hydrolytic enzymes. Key proteins involved in autophagy in mammals are shown on the right.

Evidence suggests that SCV membrane damage exposes specific signature molecules either on the bacterial surface or on the inner face of the SCV membrane, and in turn, these molecules recruit adaptor proteins from the cytosol that then recruit autophagy components to the SCV (FIG. 2b) . For example, it has been shown that a population of bacteria is associated with ubiquitylated proteins shortly after invasion, indicating exposure to the cytosol 76 . These ubiquitin-positive bacteria also colocalize with adaptor protein p62 (see above) and LC3 (REF. 55 ), which suggests that p62 links the bacteria to autophagosomes via LC3. The adaptor protein optineurin 58 also has a role in bacterial autophagy: phosphorylation of optineurin by the innate immune receptor TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1; which activates the transcription of type I interferons (IFNs)) strengthens its interaction with LC3, which restricts the intracellular growth of S. Typhimurium 58 . Recently, a host ubiquitin E3 ligase, leucine-rich repeat and sterile \u03b1-motifcontaining 1 (LRSAM1), was found to have a role in the ubiquitylation of proteins that are associated with the autophagy of S.

Specifically, SCV membrane damage exposes the host cell sugar molecule \u03b2-galactoside -which normally localizes to the plasma membrane surface and luminal face of endosomes, including SCV membranes -to the cytosol. This \u03b2-galactoside is recognized by its cytosolic receptor, galectin 8, which binds NDP52 and thus recruits LC3 to the damaged SCV 78 . Remarkably, it is the recruitment of NDP52 to bacteria through galectin 8 binding, not ubiquitin binding, that is required for NDP52-mediated autophagy of S. Typhimurium. Therefore, both ubiquitin and sugar signals contribute to the autophagy of bacteria in damaged vacuoles. The existence of three adaptor-mediated pathways (p62, optineurin and NDP52) might guarantee the maximal targeting of cytosol-exposed bacteria, although the order of activation of each pathway is not entirely clear at the moment. The peak of LC3 association with S. Typhimurium is at 1 hour post-infection, a time at which both ubiquitin and galectin 8 have been recruited to the bacteria 76, 78 . It is possible that ubiquitin recruits p62 and optineurin to the bacteria at the same time and that galectin 8 recruits NDP52 in parallel. More precise kinetic and microscopic studies are needed to resolve the order of translocation of ubiquitin and galectin 8 to the bacteria at the early stages of infection.",

After invasion of host cells, the bacterium resides in a bacterium-containing vacuole (or phagosome). Some bacteria damage the vacuolar or phagosomal membrane and eventually escape into the cytosol. Autophagy can target bacteria in damaged vacuoles or phagosomes (as with, for example, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium) or in the cytosol (as with, for example, Group A Streptococcus) and deliver them to the lysosome for degradation. b | Model of the antibacterial autophagy of S. Typhimurium. The bacterium resides in a Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCV) after invading epithelial cells. Early after infection (~1 hour), the membrane of a subset of SCVs is damaged and the bacterium is exposed to the cytoplasm, where it becomes associated with ubiquitylated proteins in a process that depends on the E3 ubiquitin ligase leucine-rich repeat and sterile \u03b1-motif-containing 1 (LRSAM1). Next, adaptor proteins, including p62, NDP52 (nuclear dot protein 52 kDa) and optineurin (OPTN) are recruited to the SCV by binding to ubiquitin, and they recruit autophagosomes by interacting with microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3), ultimately resulting in autolysosome formation. The damaged SCV membrane also exposes \u03b2-glycans to the cytoplasm and recruits galectin 8 (GAL8), which binds to NDP52 and further recruits LC3. Also at ~1 hour post-infection, a subset of bacteria recruits diacylglycerol (DAG) to the undamaged SCVs. DAG activates protein kinase C\u03b4 (PKC\u03b4), which activates NADPH oxidase (NOX) and promotes reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, in turn inducing LC3-associated phagocytosis of bacteria. At ~4 hours post-infection, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is redistributed to the SCV membrane, which inhibits autophagy induction, resulting in autophagy escape and enabling bacteria to replicate in SCVs. T3SS, type III secretion system. recruited to SCVs by at least one other, non-canonical pathway. Indeed, S. Typhimurium is also targeted by the LAP pathway. It has been shown that NADPH oxidase and ROS are necessary for efficient recruitment of LC3 to bacteria 70 . In addition, the lipid signalling molecule diacylglycerol (DAG) is recruited to SCVs, and its production is necessary for efficient LC3 recruitment to bacteria 79 . In fact, DAG-positive bacteria are not associated with ubiquitin or p62, and inhibiting both DAG and p62 leads to an additive inhibitory effect on LC3 recruitment to the bacteria. These results suggest that the DAG pathway and the ubiquitin-adaptor pathway contribute independently to the recruitment of LC3 to S. Typhimurium. The downstream effector of DAG, protein kinase C\u03b4 (PKC\u03b4), is also required for LC3 recruitment to bacteria 79 . PKC\u03b4 can activate NADPH oxidase by phosphorylation of one of its components 80 , which suggests that DAG-dependent LC3 targeting of bacteria involves the PKC\u03b4-NADPH oxidase-ROS pathway.",

Many bacteria express cAMP-increasing toxins to inhibit host innate immune responses. For example, oedema factor toxin from Bacillus anthracis is an adenylyl cyclase that can directly increase intracellular cAMP levels 100 , and cholera toxin from Vibrio cholerae is an ADP ribosyltransferase that is capable of indirectly increasing cAMP by activating host adenylyl cyclases 101 . Both toxins have inhibitory effects on host cell autophagy induction: when cells were treated with purified toxins, the induction of different types of autophagy was significantly reduced, including rapamycin-induced autophagy, S. Typhimuriuminduced autophagy and LAP 4 , suggesting that cAMP regulates an upstream signal that is common for all of the above tested autophagy pathways.",

For example, Legionella pneumophila induces autophagy in infected mouse macrophages in a manner that is dependent on the bacterial type IV secretion system (T4SS; known as the Dot/Icm secretion system) 102 . The bacterium is internalized in a phagosome wrapped by ER structures (a process that is thought to favour bacterial growth), in which autophagy components, such as ATG7 and LC3, are sequentially recruited to eventually deliver the bacterium to lysosomes 102 . However, it was recently shown that L. pneumophila can avoid autophagy targeting during infection of human embryonic kidney 293 cells 10 by the production of the T4SS effector RavZ. This protein functions as an ATG4B-like cysteine protease that directly targets the amide bond between the tyrosine and the glycine at the C terminus of LC3, which is covalently linked to PE on autophagy induction to form LC3-PE 10 . Therefore, RavZ irreversibly deconjugates LC3 from PE and inhibits autophagosome formation. This is the first evidence of a bacterial effector protein mimicking the function of a host autophagy component to modify another critical autophagy protein and inhibit the whole process.",

Another study reported that the S. flexneri T3SS effector VirA has a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) domain, which suggests that it can inactivate RAB GTPases 9 .

These bacteria become sequestered in multilamellar autophagosomes by the ubiquitin-p62 and NDP52-LC3 pathways, and show defective replication 6, 54 . Compared with \u0394icsB bacteria (of which ~35% are targeted to autophagosomes at 2 hours post-infection and ~50% are targeted to autophagosomes at 6 hours post-infection), only ~10% of wild-type bacteria are targeted for autophagy throughout the first 6 hours of infection, which suggests that S. flexneri uses IcsB to escape autophagy 6 . In fact, IcsB binds to a bacterial surface protein, IcsA (also known as VirG), and competes with its binding to host ATG5, thereby masking the bacteria from ATG protein recognition 6 (FIG. 3b) . In addition, when compared with wild-type bacteria, \u0394icsB mutants are more frequently surrounded by cage-like structures formed by septins, a group of conserved GTP-binding proteins that are often found at the cell-bud neck during cell division, and these entrapped bacteria are targeted for autophagy 108 . As septins are necessary for the recruitment of ubiquitin, p62 and NDP52 to the bacteria 54 , it is possible that IcsB masks the bacteria from septins and prevents their autophagic targeting. Identifying the septin binding partners on bacteria and elucidating their interactions with IcsB will be necessary to fully understand how IcsB blocks septin cage capture.",

However, another study using a different L. monocytogenes strain found that it was not the actin-based motility but instead the ability of ActA to recruit host proteins (such as actin, the ARP2/3 complex and vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein) that enabled the bacteria to escape autophagy 8 . Specifically, at 2 hours and 4 hours post-infection, only ~5% of wild-type bacteria were LC3-positive (and thus targeted for autophagy), but nearly 60% of \u0394actA2 bacteria were associated with LC3 (REF. 8 ). However, actAmutant bacteria, which cannot polymerize actin and lack motility but can recruit other host proteins, successfully escaped autophagy recognition.

In this case, evasion of autophagy is mediated by T3SS1, as bacteria that lack the putative T3SS1 ATPase encoded by bpscN successfully enter the cytosol but are more efficiently targeted by LC3 and show defective survival in RAW macrophages 114, 115 .",

The bacteria become sequestered in double-membrane autophagosomes during infection of HeLa cells, but fusion of these autophagosome with the lysosome is inhibited and they are used as replicative niches 13 . Following replication, the bacteria escape into the cytosol and cause autophagy-dependent cell death, and this depends on host ATG5 (REF. 13) (but not on PtdIns3KC3 and BECN1 (REF. 139 )) and the bacterial accessory gene regulator (Agr) system, specifically the Agr-secreted \u03b1-haemolysin (Hla). Indeed, agr and hla mutants cannot trigger autophagy and are delivered to lysosomes, where they are degraded 13, 139 . Interestingly, S. aureus infection decreased cellular cAMP levels and reduced the activity of the cAMP effector exchange protein directly activated by cAMP 1 (EPAC; also known as RAPGEF3) and the downstream factor RAP2B 140 , suggesting that bacteria trigger autophagy by inhibiting the cellular cAMP-EPAC-RAP2B pathway. Notably, RAP2B is known to increase the levels of cytoplasmic calcium, which is required for the activation of calpains, a family of cysteine proteases that cleave ATG5 to generate a form of ATG5 that does not function in autophagy but instead is involved in apoptosis induction. Similarly, A. phagocytophilum grows in double-membrane vacuoles that are decorated with autophagy proteins, such as LC3 and BECN1 (REFS 12, 126) . Autophagosome formation is nucleated by the bacterial T4SS secreted effector anaplasma translocated substrate 1, which directly binds BECN1 (REF. 126 ).

B. abortus resides in a Brucellacontaining vacuole (BCV) after internalization by phagocytic or epithelial cells, and traffics from this endocytic compartment to the ER to form the ER-derived BCV (rBCV), which is permissive for bacterial replication. At a later infection stage, rBCVs further convert into double-or multi-membrane autophagic BCVs (aBCVs), and this requires ULK1 and BECN1-ATG14L-PtdIns3KC3 activity but is independent of membrane elongation factors, including ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L1 and LC3-PE 131 . At very late time points during infection, heavily infected cells release bacteria and cause re-infection of neighbouring cells, which generates infection foci. Approximately 80% of these infection foci have been shown to have aBCV-containing cells, and formation of infection foci depended on ULK1 or BECN1 expression as well as on aBCV formation 131 . Collectively, these results suggest that B. abortus hijacks some of the autophagy components to form the aBCV, which enables bacterial cell-to-cell spread. It was speculated that the aBCVs can promote the release of bacteria out of the cell, but further work is needed to clarify the possible mechanisms that are involved.",

Since these two seminal studies, there has been a flurry of research on antibacterial autophagy by microbiologists, cell biologists and immunologists. Notably, although bacteria can be targeted by autophagy, increasing evidence suggests that pathogenic bacteria have developed many ways of interfering with the host autophagy machinery. These include the use of virulence factors to camouflage the bacteria or to directly subvert autophagy signalling and/or autophagy proteins, thereby avoiding autophagy targeting.

Of note, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing 1 (NOD1) and NOD2, which are cytosolic NOD-like receptors (NLRs) that detect peptidoglycans on intracellular pathogens, are involved in the induction of autophagy targeting of S. flexneri and L. monocytogenes by directly binding to ATG16L1 and recruiting it to the bacterial entry site on the plasma membrane 141 . It will be important to investigate whether other bacteria that can be sensed by NOD1 and NOD2 also trigger xenophagy by the same mechanism. It will also be necessary to characterize how different signalling pathways regulate xenophagy induction at the same time in a coordinated manner, as well as how they activate autophagy initiation proteins, such as the ULK1 complex.",

Although the ubiquitin-adaptors-LC3 pathway seems to be the main mechanism of autophagy recognition for some bacteria, other mechanisms also exist. For example, tectonin \u03b2-propeller repeat-containing protein 1 (TECPR1) is thought to function as a cargo receptor that links autophagosomes to S. flexneri, S. Typhimurium and GAS by interacting with ATG5 and WIPI2 (REF. 142 ). However, it remains unknown how TECPR1 recognizes different bacteria. Moreover, TECPR1 only localizes to ubiquitin-negative bacteria 142 , suggesting that it mediates a ubiquitin-independent pathway. In addition, a recent study showed that human transmembrane protein 59 interacts with ATG16L1 via a 19-amino-acid-long motif 143 , thereby selectively targeting endosomes to autophagy. The same ATG16L1-binding motif was found in other proteins, suggesting that adaptor proteins that engage ATG16L1 could target other specific cargoes, such as bacteria, to autophagy.",
