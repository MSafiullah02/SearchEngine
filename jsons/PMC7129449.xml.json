Definitely not, and Table 2 in my review was intended more to indicate the fact that, unfortunately, only a few commercially validated tests are available, and that this number has not increased significantly in the last few years. However, in the laboratory, tests are needed for a growing number of viral targets (whether such tests are based on molecular testing, serology or virus culture is not relevant). The implementation of tests for Epstein\u2013Barr virus has been successful in our hospital for allogeneic bone marrow transplant patients, and the value of adenovirus detection in the same group of young patients has also been demonstrated [4].",

However, the example of detecting adenovirus in the nasopharynx, as mentioned by Professor Madeley, demonstrates the importance of quantitative results. The technology is available, and the information is needed to understand the importance of viral load in relation to clinical outcome. The recent detection of almost 9% of double infections in respiratory samples, as reported by several groups at the recent meeting of the European Society for Clinical Virology in Copenhagen, strengthens the need for and value of this quantitative information.",

I agree that parainfluenza viruses should be on the shortlist, but other important viruses are also missing. Technology is developing fast, and it is becoming possible to combine a positive and quantitative signal with typing for a growing number of viruses, including enteroviruses (and parechovirus) and adenoviruses.",

We both agree that high\u2010quality cell culture\u2010based facilities are needed, not only to obtain epidemiologically relevant strains, but also to detect \u2018new\u2019 and emerging viruses. However, this is a problem for those laboratories that do not have any culture facilities, or for which transportation of clinical specimens to the laboratory takes a relatively long period. Is the molecular diagnostics approach the answer to better clinical virology? The answer \u2018yes\u2019 is too easy, simply because the technology itself can be rather difficult to implement, and information on the primers and probes needed is often limited with respect to their clinical performance. Unfortunately, studies that analyse only a limited number of clinical reference strains and samples are still in the majority. So, although it is necessary to remain critical, it cannot be denied that molecular testing is a significant aid to diagnosis.",

The number of laboratories with EM facilities is even smaller, with a consequent loss of knowledge. I agree with Professor Madeley in this respect, but while practice makes (more) perfect, it is important to realise that in a large number of laboratories, there is already no practice at all.",
