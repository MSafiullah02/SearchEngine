Vaccines used for smallpox vaccination are derived from vaccinia virus, a species similar to cowpox. The virus that causes smallpox is variola virus. This virus belongs to the Poxviridae family and Orthopoxvirus genera which include the vaccinia, cowpox and monkeypox viruses. The smallpox vaccine consists of several strains of the live attenuated vaccinia virus and has served as the prototype of a successful viral vaccine. Prior to immunization, smallpox infection killed hundreds of millions of people. The eradication of this disease has been considered one of the greatest accomplishments in medicine. Because of recent concerns that smallpox may be used for potential biological warfare, the threat of this virus has not been completely eliminated. Renewed interest has developed in the production of smallpox vaccines.",

The virus is able to grow and induce an immunological response, which serves to protect the host against smallpox. Dryvax (Wyeth Laboratories Inc., Marietta, Pennsylvania) is licensed for immunization of smallpox public health and healthcare response teams and laboratory workers who are involved with research activities involving the vaccinia virus. An emergency vaccination strategy has been developed in the event of a smallpox outbreak to fulfill the recommendations of the national Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice (ACIP).5., 6. Smallpox vaccination priority will be given to those with early diagnosis of cases, all who had been in contact with the patient since onset of fever, all household members of the contacts, healthcare workers, public health personnel, first responders and other personnel who will assist with outbreak control measures and emergency response activities.5., 6. Dryvax, a stored lyophilized calf-lymph vaccine, is freeze dried and reconstituted before use with a diluent that contains 50% glycerin and 0.25% phenol. When reconstituted, the lyophilized undiluted vaccine contains \u223c100 million living vaccinia virus/mL. In the absence of circulating smallpox, this vaccine is contraindicated in individuals with allergies to polymyxin B sulfate, streptomycin sulfate, chlortetracycline hydrochloride and neomycin sulfate. Those individuals, who have allergic symptoms to the above compounds and have contact with individuals with smallpox or the presence of smallpox, should be concurrently given antihistamine or glucocorticoids. The smallpox vaccine is also contraindicated in persons: with a history or presence of eczema or atopic dermatitis; who have other acute, chronic, or exfoliative skin conditions; who have conditions associated with immunosuppression such as persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); using topical ocular steroid medications; are <18 year of age; pregnant or intend to become pregnant during the next 4 weeks; or breastfeeding.7 Eczema vaccinatum (Fig. 1), a serious form of disseminated vaccinia infection, can occur among persons with atopic dermatitis and other dermatologic conditions. Persons reporting atopic dermatitis or other dermatologic conditions in themselves or household members should not be vaccinated, unless a healthcare provider determines that the rash is not eczema or atopic dermatitis.7\n",

In more than 90% of volunteers vaccinated against smallpox 25\u201375 years ago, a substantial humoral or cellular immunity (or both) against vaccinia persisted, whereas antiviral T-cell responses declined slowly, with a half-life of 8\u201315 years.11 Individuals undergoing postexposure vaccination should receive the smallpox vaccination within 3 days of exposure.12 Postvaccination may prevent the natural history of the disease, alter the severity of the disease, and provide protection from mortality. Some epidemiological evidence suggests that postexposure vaccination can be done up to 4\u20137 days.9\n",

The cold-adapted, live attenuated, trivalent influenza virus vaccine (FluMist) is able to replicate in the cooler nasal passages and stimulate mucosal as well as systemic immunity, similar to natural infection. However, the altered virus is unable to grow in the warmer temperatures of the lower respiratory tract. Placebo, controlled clinical studies in children 15\u201371 months of age have shown the vaccine to be 93% effective in preventing culture-positive influenza A and B infections.36 Also, the vaccinated group had 21% fewer febrile illnesses and 30% fewer cases of febrile otitis media when compared with placebo. Adverse reactions were mild and included rhinorrhoea, fever, and lethargy. A similar study in 4561 adults demonstrated 23% fewer days of severe febrile illness and 25% fever days of febrile upper respiratory tract illness resulting in 28% fewer missed work days and 41% fewer physician visits.37 This needle-free vaccine is conveniently administered and is recommended to prevent influenza in healthy people 5\u201349 years of age. The disadvantage of Flumist is the cost. It is at least $60 per dose (and not covered by Medicare or most insurance plans), compared to the inactivated influenza vaccine at the usual cost of $10\u201320 per dose (which is covered by Medicare Part B and Medicaid and most insurance plans).38 Healthy individuals aged 9\u201349 years are administered a single dose annually before the winter, and children aged 5\u20138 years, are recommended to have two doses the first year they are immunized with cold-adapted, trivalent influenza vaccine to ensure protection against all strains contained in the vaccine.39 Thereafter, a single annual revaccination for the child is sufficient.",

In October 2000, it was introduced to the Swiss market as the first licensed intranasal influenza vaccine in the world. However, 7 months after its release, the Swiss Drug Monitoring Center and various University of Zurich institutions received 46 case reports of Bell's palsy among recipients of the vaccine. Berna Biotech suspended distribution of the vaccine, and a clinical investigation into the association was started. From October 1, 2000 to April 30, 2001, a total of 773 patients with Bell's palsy were identified in Switzerland. Of the 412 who could be evaluated, 250 (60.7%) were enrolled and matched with 722 control patients. In this case\u2013control study, 68 patients with Bell's palsy (27.2%) and eight controls (1.1%) had received the intranasal vaccine (P<0.001).42 Compared to parenteral vaccines, this intranasal vaccine was associated with a significantly increased risk of Bell's palsy (adjusted odds ratio, 84.0; 95% confidence interval, 20.1\u2013351.9), 19 times the risk in the controls, which corresponds to 13 excess cases per 10 000 vaccines. It was found that the period of highest risk was 31\u201360 days after vaccination. The vaccine has since been taken off the market. It should be mentioned that Bell's palsy has not been reported with FluMist, another intranasal influenza vaccine.",

An inactivated, split virion influenza vaccine named Vaxigrip given to children, adults, and the elderly has been shown to be safe and immunogenic.46 As recommended by the WHO for the 1998\u20131999 influenza season, both vaccines contained the three strains: A/Beijing/262/95 (H1N1), A/Sydney/5/97 (H3N2), and B/Beijing/184/93.

Both vaccines were immunogenic for the three strains of influenza. In subjects 75 years of age or older, Fluad was more immunogenic than Vaxigrip for all three virus strains.

These mutated viruses are called revertants and are believed to occur in almost all vaccine recipients, but it only rarely results in paralytic disease. The VAPP that results is identical to that caused by wild virus, and may be permanent.58 In 2002, the World Health Organization (WHO) certified Europe \u2018free of poliomyelitis\u2019.59 The last European case of indigenous wild poliomyelitis occurred in eastern Turkey in 1998, when a 2-year-old unvaccinated boy was paralyzed by the virus.

The remaining six cases developed in community contacts.58 VAPP occurs more frequently in adults, immunodeficient persons, and those receiving their first dose of OPV.67 Because of the diminished risk for wild poliovirus disease in the U.S., the risk for VAPP is now considered to be less acceptable.58 It is now recommended that to eliminate the risk for VAPP, an all-IPV schedule be used for routine childhood vaccination in the United States. All children should receive four doses of IPV: at age 2 months, age 4 months, between ages 6 and 18 months, and between ages 4 and 6 years. OPV, if available, may be used only for the following special circumstances: (1) mass vaccination campaigns to control outbreaks of paralytic polio; (2) unvaccinated children who will be traveling within 4 weeks to areas where polio is endemic or epidemic; and (3) children of parents who do not accept the recommended number of vaccine injections; these children may receive OPV only for the third or fourth dose or both. In this situation, healthcare providers should administer OPV only after discussing the risk of VAPP with parents or caregivers.

The measles vaccine is produced by culturing the Moraten virus strain in chick embryo cells. The measles vaccination produces both a humoral and cellular immune response.89 After receiving a two dose MMR vaccine, 95\u201399% of recipients develop serologic evidence of immunity to measles.90., 91. Immunity is believed to be life-long, and similar to an acquired infection with the wild-type virus.92 Although extremely rare, measles infection has been reported in patients with previously documented postimmunization seroconversion.93., 94. From 1985 to 1990, epidemic of measles cases were found to be occurring among unvaccinated children and much less frequently in vaccinated children, mostly children under 5 years of age.93., 94. Vaccinated children who received only one dose were not always protected from measles, thus, leading to the recommendation of a second dose for children between the ages of 5 and 19 years of age to ensure protection for those children who did not develop immunity to the first dose. Since 1990, sporadic outbreaks of measles have occurred in populations that refuse vaccination or only received one dose of the measles vaccination, including communities in Utah and Nevada, Christian Scientist schools in Missouri and Illinois, and adult and student communities.93., 94.\n",

In addition, some of these vaccines led to pathogenic infections because of incomplete inactivation of the vaccine virus. Safer duck embryo vaccines were later introduced, but proved to be less immunogenic. After years of development and studies, cell culture-derived vaccines have become the gold standard for rabies immunization. The human diploid cell vaccine (HDCV), licensed in the U.S. in 1980, contains concentrated and purified inactivated rabies virus from the Pitman-Moore strain. Compared with previous rabies vaccines, the HDCV induced higher levels of antibody response at an earlier time. Multiple studies have shown HDCV to be effective for both preexposure and postexposure immunization.123., 124., 125.\n",

This vaccine is produced by the growth of fixed rabies virus strain Flury LEP in chicken embryo fibroblast culture. Clinical studies have shown it to be as effective and well-tolerated as HDCV, with antibody responses in over 99% of recipients.135., 136. Compared with HDCV, no type III hypersensitivity reactions have been observed with PCECV,137 but serious anaphylactic reactions or neuroparalytic events have been reported. Rabies vaccine absorbed (RVA) is another available rabies vaccine, which is produced by growth of the Kissling strain of Challenge Virus Standard rabies virus in fetal rhesus lung diploid cell culture. All three types of the inactivated rabies vaccine are considered comparable in safety and efficacy.129\n",

This is especially important in the populations with lower rates of seroconversion. Few studies are available on the duration of immunity afforded by the hepatitis B vaccine. The available studies suggest that long-term efficacy is expected.147 In the first year after vaccination, antibody levels decline rapidly. Thereafter, the antibody levels decline at a slower pace.154 The loss of detectable antibodies to hepatitis B years after vaccination does not necessarily indicate a lack of immunity. The majority of individuals are protected by immunological memory in B lymphocytes, which mount an anamnestic response to natural infection.155 There are, however, case reports of individuals developing hepatitis B infection after being previously vaccinated.156., 157.

The advantage of this vaccine is the reduced number of injections from 5 to 3. This vaccine is administered at months 0, 1 and 6. Preliminary data from 11 clinical trials indicate that 99.9% of vaccinees develop seroconversion against hepatitis A virus and 98.5% against hepatitis B surface antigen, with persistence up to 4 years (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, unpublished data, 2001).

The WHO and most experts agree that travelers visiting endemic areas should be vaccinated, and these regions include Africa, Asia except Japan and Singapore, the Caribbean, Mexican border, and remote parts of Eastern Europe.185., 186., 187., 188. The hepatitis A vaccine, licensed in 1995, has also been considered to be included in routine childhood immunizations, but due to most children experiencing asymptomatic or mild infection, this recommendation of universal immunization of children with hepatitis A is not currently implemented. Two inactivated hepatitis A vaccines, Havrix and Vaqta, are licensed and available in the U.S. Both vaccines are propagated in human diploid fibroblast culture and inactivated by formalin. These vaccines are administered in two doses given at 6\u201312 months apart in adults and children 2 years and older. Both of these inactivated vaccines show excellent as well as comparable immunogenicity and efficacy rates. Over 97% of recipients develop protective levels of antibodies within 1 month after the first dose, and over 99% of recipients are protected 1 month after the second dose.185., 186., 187., 188., 189., 190. In placebo-controlled clinical trials in Thailand (which has high rates of hepatitis A), two doses of the inactivated hepatitis A vaccine were 94% effective in protecting against hepatitis A infection.191 A similar study showed 100% efficacy in children in New York after a single dose of vaccine.192\n",

The varicella vaccine, developed by Takahashi in 1974 and approved in 1995, is a live-attenuated Oka strain vaccine. This vaccine has been shown to be very safe and effective.206., 207., 208. All susceptible children who are at least 12 months of age through 18 years should receive the varicella vaccine. The varicella vaccine is recommended as part of the routine childhood immunization schedule at 12\u201318 months of age. The ACIP recommends varicella vaccine for all susceptible children who are at least 12 months old to prevent disease due to and transmission of varicella. Healthcare workers with unknown immunization status with the varicella zoster vaccine, should be screened by serologic tests, and immunized if they are found to be seronegative to varicella zoster virus (VZV). As for the geriatric population, a few studies have shown restoration of VZV cell-mediated immunity on administration of live-attenuated varicella vaccine which lasts up to 4 years after vaccination.209., 210., 211., 212., 213. Various studies report serum anti-VZV antibody concentrations, and production of interferon-gamma to be increased following vaccination.214 From these studies, it is likely that enhancement of cell-mediated immune response in elderly individuals through vaccination with live-attenuated varicella vaccine will protect this population from herpes zoster and attenuate its complications.212 Large, placebo, controlled-clinical trials are underway to examine the potential efficacy of this vaccine in the geriatric population.",

The first RSV vaccine tested in the mid-1960s was an intramuscular, formalin-inactivated and aluminum-precipitated vaccine.271., 272. In children less than 2 years of age, it was observed that after the administration of the vaccine, subsequent natural infection with RSV was associated with a more severe respiratory disease.271., 272. The most widely accepted theory for this phenomena is that an imbalance occurred in the Th1 and Th2 lymphocyte responses to the vaccine. Mice immunized with the formalin-inactivated RSV vaccine had pulmonary histologic findings consistent with a Th2-type response with an ineffective immune response to RSV.28 Due to these past events with the formalin-inactivated RSV vaccine, no inactivated RSV vaccines are being researched.",

In adults and RSV-seropositive children the cpts 530/1009, cpts 248/955 and cpts 248/404 mutants have been shown to be safe.274 However, these cpts mutants have been underattenuated in young infants and hence are not sufficiently safe vaccine candidates to proceed further in vaccine trials in infants.275., 276. In infants, the cpts 248/955 and cpts 530/1009 mutants produced prolonged viral replication and were insufficiently attenuated, as the virus was transmitted to almost a quarter of placebo recipients. The cpts 248/404 vaccine was associated with an increased frequency of upper respiratory symptoms and little evidence of lower respiratory illness.276 However, there was a reduction in reinfectivity with the second dose, implying that the first dose was somewhat protective. Recent developments in reverse genetic technology have allowed for the genetically engineered mutant virus (rABcp 248/404/1030, rA2cp 248/404/1030[\u03b5]SH), which recently has been evaluated in infants and appears to be promising as a vaccine candidate.274\n",

One vaccine was recently removed from the market due to safety issues. Rotashield was a live, oral tetravalent, rotavirus vaccine that was associated with several cases of intussusception and considered to be causal.326 Most associations between vaccines and adverse events are not demonstrated to be causal. For example, the measles mumps rubella (MMR) vaccine was reported not to have a causal relationship to autism.77., 78., 79.
