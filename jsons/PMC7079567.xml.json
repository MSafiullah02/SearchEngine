Coronaviruses (CoVs) cause severe diseases of the respiratory system, gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system [2]. FCoV causes feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), which is a transmissible inflammation of the visceral serosa and omentum with exudation into the abdomen [3]. Another form of the disease is characterized by granulomatous involvement of parenchymatous organs such as the kidneys, mesenteric lymph nodes, bowel wall, liver, central nervous system and eyes [4]. Mortality is extremely high once clinical signs appear, and no effective drugs for treating FIP are available.",

            "text": "Viral replication requires numerous host factors [5, 6] that represent potential targets of antiviral therapy. RNA viral genomes typically replicate with low fidelity and undergo rapid evolutionary changes. Therefore, inhibitors targeting host factors may be preferred as the development of resistance is less likely. Cyclophilins (Cyps) and FK506-binding proteins belong to peptidyl-prolyl cis\u2013trans isomerase (PPIase) families that catalyse cis\u2013trans isomerization of the imidic prolyl peptide bond and are pharmacological targets of cyclosporin A (CsA) and FK506 [7, 8]. CsA is a well-known immunosuppressive drug that binds to cellular Cyps to inhibit calcineurin, a calcium\u2013calmodulin-activated serine/threonine-specific phosphatase. The inhibition of calcineurin blocks the translocation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells from the cytosol into the nucleus, thus preventing the transcription of genes encoding cytokines, such as interleukin-2. CsA is a potent inhibitor of certain human and animal CoVs [9, 10]. However, FK506 also suppresses calcineurin activity and signalling through the nuclear factor of activated T cells at the same stage as CsA but without affecting FCoV replication [11]. Moreover, the replication of animal CoVs such as infectious bronchitis virus and transmissible gastroenteritis virus is not inhibited by FK506 [12]. However, this drug effectively inhibits the replication of human CoVs, severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV), HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E [13]. This indicates that the mechanism underlying CoV replication between human and animals requires different cellular immunophilins such as Cyps and FK506-binding proteins. The mechanism underlying the inhibitory effects of CsA on CoV replication is poorly understood, although the fact that CypA and CypB do not affect SARS-CoV replication [9] is important. Furthermore, HCoV-NL63 replication depends on CypA but not CypB [14]. In addition, single-nucleotide polymorphism variants near the human CypA active site are required for HCoV-229E replication [12].",

These three sites are strictly conserved in many species and might be dominant-negative inhibitors of isomerase activity [16]. Moreover, these sites drastically reduce the affinities between CypA and CsA as shown by moe (Molecular Operating Environment) software analysis (Fig. S1). fcwf-4 cells were transfected with CypA mutants (CypA-R55A, CypA-F60A and CypA-H126Q), and all mutant proteins were expressed (Fig. 6a) as predicted in Fig. S1.

Therefore, we replaced Arg-62 and Phe-67 in the PPIase catalytic domain of CypB with Ala (R62A-CypB mutant) and Ala (F67A-CypB mutant) (Table S2). These sites are conserved in many species. Carpentier et al. [17] reported that these residues lead to a dramatic loss of PPIase activity, approximating 8\u201312 % of wild-type CypB isomerase activity. Also, these two sites drastically reduce the affinity between CypB and CsA as shown by moe software analysis (Fig. S2). Although the protein expression level of CypB-F67A mutant was less than that of the CypB-R62A mutant as predicted in Fig. S2, FCoV-N expression levels were reduced by approximately 70 % in the cells transfected with plasmids encoding each mutant residue (Fig. 6d, e). In contrast, compared with the vector control, FCoV-N expression was increased by approximately 60 % in cells transfected with wild-type CypB (Fig. 6e). Protein expression levels of endogenous CypA and CypB were not affected in the cells transfected with each plasmid (Fig. 6d). Although the number of virus copies in the cells transfected with wild-type CypB was increased, those in all cells transfected with the mutant genes were reduced compared with the control cells (Fig. 6f). These data suggest that the isomerase active sites of CypB are implicated in viral protein expression.",

Furthermore, Cyp expression was inhibited in cells transfected with respective Cyp-specific shRNAs. FCoV replication and protein expression were restored in KD-CypA-fcwf and KD-CypB-fcwf cells transfected with wild-type CypA and CypB expression vectors. However, FCoV replication was not completely inhibited in KD-CypA-fcwf or KD-CypB-fcwf cells. Hypothetically, the low residual levels of CypA and CypB in these cells supported viral replication, or other Cyps or host factors compensated for the decreased activities of CypA and CypB. Consequently, we examined the role of CypA and CypB in FCoV replication using CypA-KO and CypB\n-KO cell lines. While we searched for other feline CypA paralog genes using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome software, we found one paralog sequence. Two CypA gene types were located on A2 and C2 genomes, respectively. There were four nucleotide differences, which translated into two different amino acid residues. With regard to CypB, no paralog sequence was found. However, the guide RNA sequence used for CypA in this study targeted the same sequence between those CypAs. These data suggest that both CypA and CypB play important roles in FCoV replication. However, RT-qPCR analysis showed that FCoV replication was not completely inhibited in Cyps-KO cells. These results suggest that other host factors compensated for activities of CypA and CypB, e.g. protein interacting with NIMA (Pin1), a member of the parvulin subfamily of PPIases, modulates FCoV propagation [18].",

Cyps with PPIase activity catalyse protein folding [8, 20] and mediate the life cycles of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and hepatitis C virus [19]. The RNA chaperone domain of the N protein of CoV encircles genomic RNA (gRNA) to form a helical ribonucleoprotein structure [21, 22]. The N protein may participate in the discontinuous transcription of subgenomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs) because depletion of N from the replicon inhibits the synthesis of sgmRNA but not that of gRNA [23]. DDX1 is a cellular RNA helicase of the DEAD box helicase family, and KD of DDX1 reduces quantities of longer infectious bronchitis virus viral RNAs [24]. Phosphorylation of the N protein allows recruitment of DDX1 to the phosphorylated-N-containing complex that facilitates template reading, thereby enabling the synthesis of longer sgmRNAs [24]. Because the N protein of SARS-CoV binds CypA and CypA is incorporated into SARS-CoV particles [25], CsA may act directly on CypA/N protein complexes to prevent CoV from synthesizing gRNA and sgmRNA. However, we have yet to determine whether CypA/N protein complexes are incorporated into virion particles.",

The mutated amino acid residues are located near the PPIase active site, which is consistent with our present data. The mutant proteins of CypA and CypB used in this study strikingly reduce the affinities between CsA and Cyps (Figs S1 and S2). These findings may indicate that those affinities between CsA and Cyps affect FCoV replication. It may be presumed that any host or viral factors bind CsA-binding regions of Cyps to contribute to FCoV replication. Namely, CsA might competitively bind the regions against those factors to inhibit FCoV replication.
