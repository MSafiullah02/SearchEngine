Evidence suggests the parasite mutates under intense drug pressure, and this has occurred at multiple sites independently within the GMS [3]; the genetic markers of artemisinin resistance (specific Kelch-13 mutations) have now been identified throughout Myanmar [4] and now encroach upon the Indian subcontinent (Fig. 1).

If or when these parasites spread to sub-Saharan Africa, the world can expect major impacts. Evolution of resistance to chloroquine is estimated to have caused two- to six-fold increases in malaria mortality and morbidity throughout sub-Saharan Africa [12], and modelling suggests the potential for ACT failures to cause 10 to 78 million additional malaria cases over a 4-year period [13].",

They need to want to eliminate malaria; achieving this is in part a question of incentives, both monetary and otherwise. The economic realities of staff on the ground need to be realistically considered, especially in light of the modest salaries for many government health staff, some of whom are obliged to have other sources of income to provide a reasonable standard of living.",

The limited number of experienced malariologists in NMCP offices face a difficult dilemma: they must remain fully engaged in high-level national and regional dialogues, but also be available for the leadership and management of practical day-to-day malaria activities. It is often that latter that suffers, hampering regional progress. One potential avenue to address this issue is externally funded support for programme and technical management. This could, for example, consist of two full-time support positions within each GMS country- one dedicated to policy and technical issues, the other for finances and on-the-ground project management, but needs would vary in each programme. The sole responsibility of these positions would be to support the national and provincial level NMCP management on practical aspects of malaria elimination- the size and scope of necessary response to MDR-P. falciparum is such that NMCPs leaders need far greater support.",

The critical and largely ignored gap is one of tracking the activities of muddy boots on the ground, and in end-of-the road clinics, villages and informal settlements. Malaria elimination requires intensive effort at the farthest periphery of the health sector, and well beyond. Comprehensive malariometric indicators and measurement of interventional coverage is certainly the ideal, but may not be realistic at the furthest periphery in often difficult conditions [33]. These \u201cbottom-line\u201d measures will not be achieved without good management of actions extending to the most remote cases. Knowing if and how these actions are taking place is possible and moreover, critical to success, as specifically emphasized in the 1940\u2019s during Brazil\u2019s Yellow Fever programme:\u201cEven after it was apparent that A. aegypti could be eradicated from any given area with the technique described, final results were often disappointingly slow and it was found that success in species elimination was to be achieved only on the basis of careful organization and meticulous supervision\u201d [34].\n",
