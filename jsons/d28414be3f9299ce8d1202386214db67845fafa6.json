Compartmental models are the most common class of models. They are very effective for qualitative analysis, but they rely on simplifying assumptions, such as homogeneous mixing and time scale separation. On the other end of the spectrum, detailed agent-based models, based on realistic mobility pattern models, provide extremely accurate predictions. However, these models require significant computing power and are not suitable for analytical treatment. Our research aims at bridging the gap between these two approaches, toward time-varying network models that are sufficiently accurate to make predictions for real-world applications, while being computationally affordable and amenable to analytical treatment. We leverage the novel paradigm of activity driven networks (ADNs), a particular type of time-varying network that accounts for inherent inhomogeinities within a population. Starting from the basic incarnation of ADNs, we expand on the framework to include behavioral factors triggered by health status and spreading awareness. The enriched paradigm is then utilized to model the 2014-2015 Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) spreading in Liberia, and perform a what-if analysis on the timely application of sanitary interventions in the field.

In Eq. (14.4) , N I regulates the intensity of the reduction in activity related to risk perception, so that \u00c1 t S D N \u00c1 S when I t D 0, and \u00c1 t S D 0 when I t D N I. In particular, the smaller N I is, the more intense the activity reduction is (a few infected individuals are sufficient to drop the activity of susceptible individuals to zero). Figure 14 .4 illustrates the steady state fraction I 1 =N of infected individuals in the case of a risk perception behavior based on Eq. (14.4), as a function of 1= N I and = . Importantly, the epidemic threshold is higher than in the case where susceptible individuals do not change their behavior as in Eq. (14.1). Also, this threshold tends to increase with 1= N I, even though for wide ranges of N I, the epidemic threshold is largely independent of its value. The steady state value of the infected fraction decreases as 1= N I increases, even though such a variation is quite secondary. These findings suggest that the adoption of a self-protective behavior related to risk perception is beneficial both to the individual and to the community. Indeed, even in the examined case in which individuals resume their usual activity once infected, this behavior still benefits the whole population, in terms both of increasing the epidemic threshold and decreasing the steady state value of the infected fraction. The second behavioral strategy is based on the assumption that risk perception is related to the rate of growth of the infection in time. We introduce t I D I t I t t as the time difference of the number of infected individuals between two consecutive iterations and N as a select threshold for such a time difference.

As expected, a more severe activity reduction (lower N ) yields a higher epidemic threshold together with a lower steady state fraction of infected individuals.

In this section, we present a model of the 2014-2015 spreading of EVD in Liberia [36] . Behavioral phenomena are of fundamental importance to account for the reduced activity of infected and hospitalized individuals, as well as the zero activity of dead yet extremely infectious corpses that are not safely buried. We calibrate the model from field data of the 2014 April-to-December spreading in Liberia and use the model as a predictive tool, to emulate the dynamics of EVD in Liberia and offer a one year projection, until December 2015. Also, we perform a what-if analysis to assess the efficacy of timely intervention policies. In particular, we show that an earlier application of the same intervention policy would have greatly reduced the number of EVD cases, the duration of the outbreak, and the infrastructures needed for the implementation of the intervention. The motivation for the selection of ADNs to model EVD is twofold. First, the incubation time of EVD, with a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 21 days [68] , is compatible with the time scale of individual mobility patterns [69, 70] . This implies that time scale separation assumptions may yield incorrect predictions on the spread of the epidemic [11] . Second, ADNs can be adapted to account for realistic phenomena that may be critical to the assessment of the severity and duration of an EVD outbreak. The epidemic model used in this work is based on the seminal Legrand's model for EVD spreading [71] , on which most of the recent research body on EVD rests [10, 18, 19, [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] . Figure 14 .6 illustrates the dynamics of the state transition of the proposed model. According to [71] , two states related to hospitalization (H) and death followed by a traditional funeral, without immediate safe burial (F) are added. The removed state (R) indicates individuals that cannot contribute any more to the dynamics of the epidemic spreading. This state contains individuals who have recovered and are immune, and those who have died and have been safely buried. In our EVD model, we partition the removed state into two states: recovered (R R ); and dead and safely buried (R D ). Similar to [35] , we assume that people infected with EVD and not hospitalized have a lower probability to come in contact with other individuals, as they will move less due to their debilitated health. Yet, such probability is non-zero, as they may infect those who take care of them, that is, friends, parents, and relatives. Thus, we differentiate the activity of susceptible and exposed individuals from that of infected ones, using two different activity rates, namely, \u00c1 SE and \u00c1 I .
