Symptoms are generally milder in children. We present an asthmatic 12-year old girl with cough, wheeze, and mild pneumonia due to COVID-19. Reverse transcription (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed COVID-19 on nasopharyngeal sample. Chest radiograph revealed bronchopneumonia. Frequent salbutamol inhalers were administered for treatment. Case was discharged home 2 days following hospitalization. COVID-19 may present with mild pneumonia in children or with an exacerbation of asthma in asthmatic children. Additional observations of clinical presentations of COVID-19 in children are recommended.",

[1] COVID-19 causes mild disease in the majority of cases; however, approximately 14% develops severe disease requiring hospitalization and oxygen support, and 5% requires admission to an intensive care unit. [1] Complications include acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, septic shock, and multi-organ failure [2] and the risk is higher in old age groups with comorbidities such as asthma, diabetes, and heart disease [3] . Critically ill patients will require mechanical ventilation [2, 4, 5] . Hypotonic solutions should be avoided in the management of COVID-19 [4] . The most common diagnosis in severe COVID-19 patients is severe pneumonia.",

Although there is a paucity of literature on pediatric risk factors, the case series to date from Wuhan on hospitalized pediatric cases do not list asthma as a pre-existing risk factor for morbidity or mortality. [11] We presented a 12-year old girl with underlying asthma who presented with mild pneumonia secondary to COVID-19. We have demonstrated that children with underlying comorbidities such as asthma may be at a greater risk of COVID-19 similar to adults with other comorbidities [3] . Though there is minimal literature on the risk that COVID-19 could trigger a viral induced exacerbation of asthma in asthmatic children [11] and little is known about COVID-19 clinical presentations in children to date, we have demonstrated that COVID-19 may present with a clinical picture of asthma or asthma exacerbation in asthmatic children, with cough; wheeze, and breathing difficulties. Nebulizers may increase the risk of disseminating COVID-19; therefore, our case was managed with inhalers (as per Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) report released on 25 March 2020 on asthma management when COVID-19 is confirmed or suspected.). Nebulizers may also increase the risks of viral lower lung deposition [11] and by stimulating cough reflex may increase risk of transmission to healthy contacts. [11] Oral corticosteroids may prolong COVID-19 clearance, and their use in the management of asthma in children infected with COVID-19 was not recommended both by WHO and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in the USA. [11] Therefore, oral corticosteroids were discontinued once the diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed.",
