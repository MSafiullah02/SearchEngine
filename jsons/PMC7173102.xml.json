In the Western Hemisphere, TSV has caused serious economic losses, whereas, YHV is viewed as one of the most significant viral pathogens in the Eastern Hemisphere (Brock, 1997, Flegel, 1997). The cumulative losses due to TSV in the Americas from 1992 to 1996 were estimated to be US$1.2\u20132.0 billion (Lightner et al., 1996). YHV has affected significantly shrimp farming in South East Asian countries including Thailand, China, Malaysia, Indonesia and India (Lightner et al., 1996).",

TSV virions are non-enveloped, icosahedral, 31\u201332 nm in diameter and contain a single stranded positive sense RNA genome of \u223c10 kb capable of encoding three major (55, 40 and 24 kDa) and one minor (58 kDa) capsid proteins (Hasson et al., 1995, Bonami et al., 1997). We have cloned and sequenced the 3\u2032-end of TSV genome (Robles-Sikisaka et al., 2001). Sequence analysis showed that, unlike mammalian picornaviruses, TSV capsid protein genes are located at the 3\u2032-end of the genome and the TSV genome organization is similar to insect picornaviruses (Robles-Sikisaka et al., 2001).",

YHV virions have an enveloped bacilliform shape of 150\u2013170\u00d740\u201350 nm in size (Wongteerasupaya et al., 1995). The viral genome contains a single stranded, positive sense RNA and encodes four major structural proteins of 170, 135, 67 and 22 kDa. The partial nucleotide sequence (open reading frame 1b) revealed that the genome organization of YHV is very similar to the gill-associated virus (GAV), reported from Australia. It has been proposed that YHV and GAV should belong to a new taxon (proposed name Okavirus) in the order Nidovirales that also included Coronaviruses, toroviruses and arteriviruses (Walker et al., 2001).",

Although conventional PCR is most sensitive among these methods, it is unable to detect a single copy of the viral genome in the infected tissue. This is critical for the development of a specific pathogen free shrimp-breeding program and for monitoring movement of live and frozen shrimp between countries. To address these issues, we have developed a rapid and highly sensitive real-time quantitative PCR method using the GeneAmp\u00ae 5700 Sequence Detection System coupled with SYBR Green chemistry. SYBR Green dye has a high affinity for double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and exhibits enhancement of fluorescence upon binding to the dsDNA. In the GeneAmp\u00ae 5700 Sequence Detection System, the fluorescence of the SYBR Green dye is monitored at the end of the each cycle and the increase in fluorescence above background is dependent on the initial template concentration (PE Biosystem GeneAmp\u00ae 5700 User Manual, 1998). The method does not need any post PCR analyses and the specificity of the product is monitored by analyzing the melting curve (Ririe et al., 1997).",

Hasson, Super Shrimp Inc. and YHV, courtesy of Dr D.V. Lightner, University of Arizona, Arizona) was prepared by homogenizing PCR confirmed TSV and YHV infected tail tissue in 2% saline (1:10 w/v) and centrifuging the homogenate in a tabletop centrifuge (Beckman Microfuge Lite Model) at 12 000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatants were diluted to 1:10 before injecting the animals. Healthy juvenile shrimp were injected with a virus inoculum (30 \u03bcl \u2248106 copies) using a 26-gauge needle and 1 ml tuberculin syringe between the last 2\u20133 tail segments on the ventral surface. Control group animals were injected with a tail muscle homogenate from PCR-confirmed virus negative healthy animals. Healthy tissue homogenate was prepared same as described above.

The threshold cycle (C\nT) is defined as the cycle at which a statistically significant increase in R\nn is first detected. Target cDNA copy number and C\nT values are related inversely. A sample containing higher copies of the target cDNA will cross the threshold at an earlier cycle compared to a sample with lower copies of the same target.

A linear relationship between the input plasmid DNA and the C\nT values was observed from 106 down to a single copy of both TSV and YHV. Detection of viruses over such a large dynamic range is useful for measuring the viral load in animals with different levels of infection. Thus SYBR Green RT-PCR provides a continuous scale for measuring the viral load. In addition, since SYBR Green RT-PCR is capable of detecting a single copy of viral genome, it will be useful to detect sub-clinical infections. Due to exquisite sensitivity of SYBR Green PCR, it is highly susceptible to PCR carry over or other contamination. Therefore, laboratory hygiene practices should be followed very strictly to prevent any potential contamination that may give false positive result. In addition, any negative result as well as samples with C\nT values close to 40 should be tested at least twice for confirmation.",

The specificity of SYBR Green RT-PCR was determined by monitoring the amplification profile and the dissociation curve of the target amplicons. In SYBR Green RT-PCR, a sample is considered positive when the amplification plot crosses the threshold value. For example, in Fig. 3A the amplification plot of TSV infected sample exceeds the threshold value at cycle number 31.45 whereas the amplification plot of the healthy sample did not exceed the threshold line. To ensure that the amplification plot obtained for TSV infected sample was indeed due to the amplification of TSV specific product, the dissociation curve of the product was analyzed (Fig. 3B). Since the dissociation curve of a product depends on its GC content, length and sequence composition; amplification of a specific versus non-specific product could be differentiated by examining the dissociation curve. The TSV amplicon provided a dissociation curve with a single peak at 72.0 \u00b0C which is expected for the TSV specific amplicon. To determine the quality and any variation in the amount of input RNA as well as the efficiency of the reverse transcriptase reaction in both healthy and TSV infected samples, EF-1\u03b1 and \u03b2-actin genes were amplified in parallel to the target virus. Both healthy and TSV infected samples provided successful amplification of EF-1\u03b1 and \u03b2-actin genes with the dissociation curve showing a single peak at the expected temperature (T\nm for EF-1\u03b1 was 79.2 \u00b0C and T\nm for \u03b2-actin was 78.8 \u00b0C, Fig. 3C\u2013F). Similar observations were recorded for YHV amplicon and the EF-1\u03b1 and \u03b2-actin controls for the corresponding samples (Fig. 4A\u2013F).",

            "text": "In addition to sensitivity and specificity, SYBR Green RT-PCR is very rapid and robust in nature. It takes about 2 h to run a 96 well plate from the time the plate is put into the instrument. After amplification, the data analysis takes a few minutes. In a 96 well plate, 22 samples can be run at a time with two replicates for each virus sample, internal control, positive control and negative control. Thus, SYBR Green RT-PCR can be used for high throughput assays for YHV and TSV detection. In recent years, real-time RT-PCR based on TaqMan chemistry, has been used for the detection of RNA viruses infecting plants (Roberts et al., 2000), animals (Moody et al., 2000, Komurian-Pradel et al., 2001, Oleksiewicz et al., 2001) and to quantitate cellular transcripts in yeast and mammals (Kang et al., 2000, Leutenegger et al., 1999, Schmittgen et al., 2000). Schmittgen et al. (2000) compared the endpoint RT-PCR to TaqMan and SYBR Green real-time RT-PCR to evaluate the time course of mRNA formation and decay of human chimeric \u03b2 globin gene. Both real-time RT-PCR methods produced a 4- to 5-log dynamic range of amplification compared to 1-log dynamic range for endpoint RT-PCR. They reported that although both real-time RT-PCR methods provided comparable dynamic range and sensitivity, SYBR Green detection was more precise and produced a more linear decay plot than the TaqMan detection system. In contrast to SYBR Green detection, multiple fluorogenic probes can be used in a TaqMan assay to detect more than one target in a reaction. However, TaqMan assay is more costly than SYBR Green assay.",

            "text": "Recently, we isolated EF-1\u03b1 by mRNA differential technique while comparing the RNA fingerprints of healthy and WSSV, a double stranded DNA containing virus, infected shrimp (Dhar et al., 2001b). The EF-1\u03b1 was expressed constitutively in both healthy and WSSV infected shrimp. We compared the amplification efficiency and sensitivity of EF-1\u03b1 and \u03b2-actin to that of TSV and YHV to determine which of these two genes could serve as a better internal reference. Ideally, the amplification efficiency as well as the sensitivity of an internal control should be comparable to the RNA under study and the internal control should be expressed at an equivalent level irrespective of tissue used, stages of development and the experimental treatments (Bustin, 2000). The sensitivity (Y intercepts) and amplification efficiency (slope) of EF-1\u03b1 was greater than \u03b2-actin when compared to both TSV and YHV amplification. For example, the sensitivity (Y intercept 39.765) and amplification efficiency (slope \u22123.582) of TSV was more similar to EF-1\u03b1 (Y intercepts 40.121, slope \u22123.443) than \u03b2-actin (Y intercepts 34.984 and slope \u22122.749) (Fig. 2A). Similarly, the slope and the intercepts of YHV curve were more similar to the EF-1\u03b1 than \u03b2-actin (Fig. 2B). There is considerable evidence that the \u03b2-actin transcription varies widely in response to experimental treatment in human breast epithelial cells, porcine tissues and canine myocardium (reviewed in Bustin, 2000). In the current study, Both EF-1\u03b1 and \u03b2-actin showed variation in their level of expression in TSV and YHV infected samples. However, based on the sensitivity and the amplification efficiency, as well as the level of variation, EF-1\u03b1 appeared to be a better internal reference for SYBR Green RT-PCR detection of TSV and YHV.",

We used the SYBR Green PCR method, along with random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) technique, to identify genetic markers in P. stylirostris shrimp populations that differ in their IHHNV load (Hizer et al., 2002).
