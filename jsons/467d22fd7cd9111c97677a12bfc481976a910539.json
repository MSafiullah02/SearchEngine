The reasons behind this complex spatiotemporal dynamics have yet to be clarified. In this study, we perform a Bayesian analysis of five models entailing different hypotheses on the possible determinants of the observed pattern. We find a consensus among all models in showing a surprisingly low transmission distance (defined as the geographic distance between the place of residence of the infectors and her/his infectees) during the first wave: about 1.5 km (2.2 km if infections linked to household and school transmission are excluded). The best-fitting model entails a change in human activity regarding contacts not related to household and school. By using this model we estimate that the transmission distance sharply increased to 5.3 km (10 km when excluding infections linked to household and school transmission) during the second wave. Our study reveals a possible explanation for the observed pattern and highlights the need of better understanding human mobility and activity patterns under the pressure posed by a pandemic threat.",

At the beginning of June 2009, more than 70 countries had been reached by the infection and the World Health Organization declared a pandemic. Because of the great attention that was paid to the pandemic threat, the surveillance of ILI cases was enhanced during the pandemic 3 and several seroprevalence surveys were performed at different time points 4-8 . This made it possible to apply several mathematical models for epidemic spread to the available data, in order to make real-time predictions 9-11 or to assess the most relevant factors for the observed patterns of spread 12,13 . The focus of the investigations was either on the national level or on specific epidemic hotspots 14 , and little has been ascertained about patterns of within-country epidemic spread (see however Gog et al. 15 for the U.S. or Eggo et al. 16 for the 1918 pandemic).",

In Europe, the pandemic progressed from West to East 12,19 , and about 66% of cases affecting European countries up to the end of June 2009 were reported in the United Kingdom 20 . Unlike all other European countries, which were characterized by moderate transmission in spring and summer and by a single fall/winter wave, in 2009, the UK experienced two waves, the first one in late spring/summer and the second one in the fall. The intensive air connections between the UK and the US and the late closure of schools for summer holidays have been identified as the main determinants of the first wave 12,21 . Data collected since 2009, together with modeling studies, have provided a clear picture of H1N1 epidemiology at the national and international scale. However, some notable patterns of spread at the sub-country level warrant further investigation. In particular, during the first wave of the pandemic, H1N1 cases were heterogeneously dispersed within England. The regions of London and West Midlands experienced early large school-based outbreaks 22,23 , and a more rapid increase of general practitioner (GP) consultation rates for influenza-like illness (ILI) with respect to the other regions 2 -this evidence was later confirmed by a Published: xx xx xxxx OPEN www.nature.com/scientificreports/ 2 Scientific RepoRts | 7: 12324 |",

All developed models account for influenza natural history and the sociodemographic characteristics of the population. They are structurally similar to those used for the analysis of influenza spread, containment and mitigation 12, [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . Briefly, all models are based on a synthetic population of agents matching socio-demographic data on age, population density, household and school structure specific for England. The transmission of the infection follows a discrete-time SLIR (Susceptible -Latent -Infectious -Removed) model, with latent periodassumed equal to the incubation period -lasting on average 1.5 days 29 and infectious period of 1.6 days, in such a way to obtain a generation time of 3.1 days 12, 30 . All models explicitly account for influenza transmission in households and schools (the latter interrupted during holidays), and transmission in all 'other settings' is assumed to depend on the geographic distance between individuals. In line with previous work on the 2009 H1N1 influenza, age-specific susceptibility to infection is considered as well 1,12,31,32 -individuals aged 15+ years have a different susceptibility to infection with respect to children. The models also consider age-specific pre-pandemic immunity rates according to serosurvey data 4 . The models, however, differ from one another in a way specifically designed to test different factors that might have shaped the spread of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. The mathematical formulation of the five models is briefly described in Sec. Methods and detailed in the Supplementary Information.",

This is defined as the distance between the place of residence of an infector and the place of residence of the infectees. The transmission distance is not a model parameter; it is instead derived from the simulations of the calibrated models. Specifically, we consider all the transmission events simulated by a specific model and, for each of them, we compute the geographic distance between the place of residence of the infector and the place of residence of the infectees. The transmission distance in 'other settings' is computed in the same way, but it accounts only for infection events linked to a contact occurring in settings other than households or schools.

On the contrary, at the end of the pandemic, estimated and actual prevalence rates 5 show a rather homogeneous pattern across all of England (see Fig. 2a ). The same pattern can also be found by looking at age-specific prevalence rates (Fig. 2b) . At the national level, the pandemic clearly showed two waves of infection (Fig. 2c ). According to our modeling analysis and in agreement with previous investigations 13 , the second wave was characterized by a markedly higher peak weekly incidence (mean 28.2, 95%CI: 14.2-43.9 cases per 1,000 individuals, to be compared with 10.8, 95%CI: 1.2-26.4 cases per 1,000 individuals for the first wave - Fig. 2c ).

Such a pattern is also clearly visible by looking at the dynamics of weekly and cumulative incidence at the resolution of single geographic cell (Fig. 3a ,b and the Supplementary Video S1). Moreover, as shown in the Supplementary Video S1, it is apparent that the fall wave spread through the country in a remarkably more homogeneous way and at a higher pace than the summer one. These patterns are driven by the detected change in the transmission distance: a lower distance during the early phase corresponds to a lower rate of spatial diffusion of the infection, while the estimated larger value in subsequent phases corresponds to a quicker and much more homogeneous geographic spread. Support to the findings obtained from model M5 come from the other analyzed models. We found a consensus between all five models with respect to several aspects of the geographic spread of the pandemic. In particular, all models estimate two major influenza waves at the national scale. At the sub-national scale, the first wave is more localized in the area of London (although to a different extent depending on the considered model), while at the end of the pandemic the estimated final attack rate is rather homogenous in all regions. The differences between the models mainly lay in the factors driving the pattern of spread. For instance model M4 estimate an unrealistically large number of imported cases to explain the pattern, while model M3 requires a remarkable influenza activity during the summer, which appears not well supported by epidemiological evidence. Results for models M1-M4 are discussed in more detail in the Supplementary Information. Epidemiological characterization of the pandemic. According to seroprevalence data 4,5 , a substantial proportion of adults and elderly were already protected against H1N1 infection and most of the cases in 2009 occurred among school-age children; the same pattern is estimated by model M5 (Fig. 4a,b) . Model simulations also suggest that individuals older than 15 years were less susceptible to infection than younger ones: the estimated age-specific susceptibility to infection of adults is 0.61 (95%CI: 0.28-0.94), compared with a baseline value of 1 for children. Such an estimate is in line with previous findings where adults were found to be approximately half as susceptible as younger individuals 1, 8, 31, 38 .",

Material and Methods), possibly ascribable to increased activity of students outside schools.

Specifically, we tested different hypotheses that could explain the observed highly localized spread during the first wave of the pandemic and the subsequent homogeneous diffusion during the second one. The mean transmission distance in settings other than households and schools has been estimated in all the analyzed models to be, during the first pandemic wave, remarkably lower (\u22482 km) than the mean commuting distance (\u224815 km). On the other hand, the model best reproducing the data highlights that such a distance increased substantially over the course of the pandemic (the estimated mean distance for the second pandemic wave was 10 km). In addition, our findings provide a clear picture of the epidemiology of the 2009 pandemic, in agreement with the existing knowledge. Children younger than 15 years were the most affected age group: other studies found that children have higher contact rates 42, 43 and a lack of pre-existing immunity 4, 5, 8, 44 ; here we also estimated a higher (about twice as much) susceptibility to infection compared with adults, similar to previous works on the 2009 H1N1 pandemic 1, 8, 31 . We estimated a relatively low value of the reproduction number (around 1.4) in both waves. We also provided quantitative estimates of the proportion of cases by setting that is crucial for determining the effectiveness of intervention options, such as school closure 28, 45, 46 , highlighting a major contribution of schools to the overall transmission. Consistent with serum sample data 5 , we estimated that London experienced a marked first wave, while other regions showed little evidence of a summer wave, and that the fall wave was lower in London than elsewhere.",

In particular, during the initial phase of the epidemic, when the attention of the public on the pandemic threat was higher, we found that infections were generated at a much closer distance than the average commuting distance. In the following phases, we estimate that the radius of diffusion of the epidemic became comparable with the distance traveled by commuters. A possible explanation for such a pattern lies in behavioral changes, spontaneously emerging as a response to the pandemic threat. During an emerging epidemic people may engage in precautionary behaviors that alter the transmission dynamics of the disease 47, 48 . An initial overestimation of the risk of infection has been detected in Italy 49 and Mexico 50 . Moreover, according to survey results 51, 52 , in the case of an influenza pandemic a large proportion of people are willing to avoid crowded places, especially public transportation. For instance, a worker who usually commutes to reach his workplace, would likely continue to travel the same distance to reach the workplace even during a pandemic, but he might decide to avoid crowded environments near the workplace (such as pubs, and restaurants) where he usually goes outside business hours. Our findings suggest that in the early phase of the pandemic behavioral changes may have led to either a reduction of mobility in absolute terms or, more likely, to a decrease in the number of potentially infectious contacts at high distance from the place of residence/study.",

However, although our results point in the direction of a human behavioral adaptation to the pandemic threat, they are far from conclusive. In fact, other factors could have been responsible for the changes in the force of infection that we measured. Clearly, data quality (far from being flawless) and (un)availability impose several limitations on our modeling analysis. First, concerning the initial seeding of the infection, we compute the region-specific probability of importing cases by using data on the total volume of incoming passengers by airport, disregarding their origin and final destination. Second, our model neglects cross-border infections that, given the geographic features of England, may have been imported from Scotland or through the Channel Tunnel, i.e. from France and continental Europe. A further limitation of the model is that transmission in workplaces is not explicitly modeled; in fact, its contribution is included in the 'other settings' component of the force of infection. However, the contribution of workplaces during the 2009 pandemic has been shown to be marginal 41 . Finally, it should be remarked that describing infection transmission through a distance kernel neglects most details of human mobility, although it has been shown that it gives an adequate description, especially in a setting like that of the UK 54 .",

During these periods transmission in schools is interrupted, whereas transmission in 'other settings' is assumed to increase, as in 12, 40 .

Infection is seeded within the population according to the actual time series of reported travel-related cases 59 . Once a case is imported, its location in a specific region is proportional to the volume of incoming air passengers per region over the period April-June 2009 as provided by the Civil Aviation Authority 60 ; within each region, imported cases are distributed proportionally to population density. Model calibration. Model calibration was performed by using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling applied to the binomial likelihood of the age-specific and region-specific prevalence of H1N1 antibodies observed in England according to serum samples collected in August 2009 4 (i.e., at the end of the first wave) and over the period January-April 2010 5 (i.e., after the end of the second wave). All models share a set of five common parameters, i.e., three transmission rates (in households, schools and 'other settings'), the relative susceptibility to infection of adults with respect to children, and one multiplying factor for the transmission in 'other settings' while schools are closed. M3 has one further free parameter determining the (possible) increase of virus transmissibility during the second wave. M4 has one parameter regulating the number of imported cases during the second wave. Models M2-M4 have one free parameter regulating the kernel function K(d) (i.e., \u03b1). Finally, model M5 has one parameter (\u03b1 1 ) regulating kernel K(d) during the first wave and a second one (\u03b1 2 ) for the second wave.

The curves were obtained by averaging over 100 simulations run by using median values of the posterior distributions of model parameters; distances have been grouped in 1 km intervals and displayed at the superior limit of the intervals, so that for instance 1 on the x-axis corresponds to secondary infections occurring between 0 km (e.g., infection between members of the same household) and 1 km.

Scientific RepoRts | 7: 12324 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-017-12415-2Comparable values have been obtained in a previous work on the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in Italy 41 , and for past influenza pandemics as well25 .Models M1-M4 provide similar estimates of epidemiological indicators with respect to those resulting from the analysis of model M5. Briefly, all models estimate a lower susceptibility to infection of adults with respect to children, ranging, on average, from 0.49 to 0.61. There is a strong consensus between the models in the value of the reproduction number of the first wave (averages ranged from 1.42 of model M1 to 1.45 of model M5), while in the second wave the estimates are slightly more variable (averages ranged from 1.22 of model M1 to 1.38 of model M3, which however assumes an increased transmissibility of the virus over the course the pandemic). Although highly variable, also the fractions of infection by setting are rather consistent between the models. The estimated parameters and epidemiological indicators for the five models are reported inTables S4 and S5 in the Supplementary Information.",

            "text": ". Specifically,\u2022 M1 This model is based on the classic model introduced by Ferguson and colleagues25 . Basically M1 differs from model by Ferguson and colleagues25 by three factors: M1 does not explicitly consider transmission in workplaces, it does not differentiate between symptomatic and asymptomatic infectious individuals, and it explicitly considers an age-specific susceptibility to infection. Model M1 has five parameters related to virus transmissibility and susceptibility to infection: three transmission rates (in households, schools and 'other settings'), the relative susceptibility to infection of adults with respect to children, and one multiplying factor for the transmission in 'other settings' while schools are closed. These parameters are epidemic-specific and thus need to be calibrated on the basis of the observed data. M1 can be considered as a reference scenario for comparing the other tested models. Note that the model has a distance dependent component of the force of infection in 'other settings' that is driven by a kernel distance function = + /[1 ( / ) ], where d is the geographic distance, a = 4 km and \u03b1 = 3 as determined by Ferguson and colleagues 25 by analyzing commuting data for the UK. Basically, the kernel defines the distance at which an infectious individual generates secondary infections through contacts in 'other settings' (i.e., all contacts except those occurring in households and schools). \u2022 M2 This model is structured exactly like model M1, except for the kernel function; here we estimate the parameter \u03b1 regulating K(d) (and set a = 1 km), hypothesizing that the mean distance of infections linked to the transmission in 'other settings' could have been different than what was estimated by Ferguson and colleagues 25 from commuting data, possibly because of a spontaneous human response of the population to the pandemic threat (as previously documented for the 2003 SARS epidemic33 ), leading to a very high spatial localization of the first pandemic wave. \u2022 M3 This model is like M2, but we let the virus transmissibility differ between the two waves by adding one free parameter regulating such a difference, either for climatic reasons or because of viral evolution, as shown by Dorigatti et al.13 for the 'third wave' . Possibly an increase in infection transmissibility might have led to a quicker spread in the second wave and thus to a rather homogeneous seroprevalence by region. \u2022 M4 This model is like M2, but we added one parameter regulating the daily number of imported cases that M5 In this model, the parameter \u03b1 regulating the infection kernel K(d) in 'other settings' is allowed to differ between the first and the second wave. This might have occurred because the population behaved differently at the beginning of the pandemic from later on, and this could have led to different patterns of epidemic spread. For the rest, the model is identical to M2.",
