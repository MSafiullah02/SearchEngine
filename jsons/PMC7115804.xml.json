It is suspected that a large amount of household disinfectants and antiseptics containing triclosan were used after the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 due to the need to against SARS coronavirus [1]. Being an anti-bacterial and anti-fungal agent, triclosan has also been included in a wide range of pharmaceutical and personal care products since then [2]. This leads to the discharge of a large amount of triclosan in densely populated cities such as Hong Kong, via domestic sewage effluent. Studies have revealed that triclosan would degrade to dioxins when exposed to sunlight in wastewater and seawater [[3], [4], [5], [6], [7]]. It has been detected not only in rivers and lakes in Hong Kong [[8], [9], [10]], but also in the human serum of Hong Kong residents [11], indicating a widespread triclosan exposure in the region.",

            "text": "Recent animal toxicological study showed that triclosan could increase colonic inflammation and associated colon tumorigenesis [12]. Long term exposure of triclosan could also promote liver fibrogenesis and tumorigenesis in mice, and the mechanism of triclosan-induced mouse liver toxicity may be relevant to human [13]. One of the main concerns about the environmental fate of triclosan is the formation of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins through photo-degradation [14,15]. It is commonly known that dioxins are potent multisite carcinogens, and of all the dioxin congeners, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin (2,3,7,8-TeCDD) is the most toxic [16,17]. Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that the potential adverse human health effects resulting from the long-term exposure to triclosan and its photo-transformation products, e.g. dioxins, could be even more severe than that expected from the triclosan-only exposure.",

Kanetoshi et al. [19] detected 2,8-dichlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin (2,8-DCDD), 2,3,7-trichlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin (2,3,7-TrCDD), and 1,2,8-TrCDD from the 20-h UV irradiation of triclosan, 4,5-dichloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy) phenol, and 5,6-dichloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)phenol, respectively. However, 1,2,3,8-TeCDD was not detected from the photolysis of 4,5,6-trichloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)phenol [19]. In another study conducted by this group, solid state triclosan and its three above-mentioned chlorinated derivatives were exposed to sunlight on a glass plate for 18 h, and all these above-mentioned dioxins including 1,2,3,8-TeCDD were determined [20]. In the subsequent photo-transformation studies of triclosan, 2,8-DCDD was identified as one of the major transformation products in aqueous environments through a photochemical cyclization reaction [[5], [6], [7],[21], [22], [23]]. However, none of these studies reported 2,3,7,8-TeCDD as the transformation product of triclosan in the environment.",

            "text": "Given the well-recognized toxicity and carcinogenicity of dioxins, it is of great environmental and toxicological importance to study the fate of triclosan and its chlorinated derivatives in the environment. Obviously, more laboratory studies on their aqueous photo-transformation and chlorination chemistry are needed to comprehensively investigate their roles in the formation of dioxins and dioxin-like compounds in aquatic environments, especially in the presence of chlorine. In this study, a sample preparation method using acidic silica gel/acidic alumina/florisil columns was developed to extract the trace amount of dioxin derivatives from samples solutions containing triclosan and its chlorinated derivatives. The enriched dioxin derivatives were then quantitatively analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS) and high resolution GC-high resolution MS (HRGC-HRMS). Using this developed analytical technique, we are not only able to characterize dioxins and chlorinated triclosans from the transformation of triclosan in the presence of active chlorine in seawater mixture, but also investigated their formation yields and possible formation mechanisms and pathways under both dark and UV irradiation conditions. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to identify 2,3,7,8-TeCDD as the aquatic photo-transformation product of triclosan in the presence of active chlorine. This indicates potential adverse human health effects could be caused by the long-term exposure to triclosan and its transformation products in the aquatic environment.",

Sixteen 8 W 365 nm UV lamps (Philips, Netherlands) were mounted on the walls of the reactor as the radiation source. The experiment was performed at room temperature (about 25\u2103) and one electric fan was used to cool down the temperature inside the reactor. Seawater collected from Tai Po Harbor in Hong Kong was filtered and used as the matrix solution, because our previous study showed that it contains very low level of triclosan and no photo-transformation products were detected in it [9]. Given the wide use of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) as a disinfectant/bleaching agent in daily life and its presence in environmental waters, NaOCl was chosen as the free chlorine precursor in this experiment. Free chlorine stock solutions were prepared using purified grade NaOCl (Acros Organics, New Jersey, USA). The concentration of total active chlorine in the sample solution is the sum of [HOCl] and [OCl\u2212], and it was measured by the DPD/FAS titrimetric method. Total triclosan includes triclosan and phenolate-triclosan. Given the pKa values of HClO and triclosan are 7.5 and 7.9 respectively, and the pH of seawater matrix was between 7.5 and 8.4, the predominant active chlorine and triclosan species got involved in the experimental system were HClO and phenolate-triclosan.",

Three tetraclosans, i.e. 5-chloro-2-(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy)phenol (tetraclosan 1), 5,6-dichloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)phenol (tetraclosan 2), and 4,5-dichloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)phenol (tetraclosan 3), and two pentaclosans, i.e. 4,5-dichloro-2-(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy)phenol (pentaclosan 1) and 4,5,6-trichloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)phenol (pentaclosan 2) were identified by comparing their mass spectra with the previously reported data [19,20,25,29] and their retention times relative to other known compounds in the GC chromatograms.

Its concentration was only 2.2 \u00b1 0.2 pg\u00b7mL\u22121 after 240 min, and kept increasing to 21.4 \u00b1 0.6 pg\u00b7mL\u22121 after the system reacted for 64 days. The 1,2,8-TrCDD and 2,3,7-TrCDD became detectable after triclosan reacted for two days in dark and 1,2,3,8-TeCDD started showing up after 32 days. However, 2,3,7,8-TeCDD was undetectable throughout the dark reaction (Table 1). As mentioned earlier, dioxins were often considered as the photo-transformation products of triclosan. Our finding suggested that under weak base (NaOCl) condition, triclosan could be transformed to dioxins in the presence of excessive active chlorine even in dark. However, their formation rates were rather slow and the formation yields of dioxins decreased with increasing number of chlorine substitutes. As shown in Fig. 3\n, 2,8-DCDD could be formed through a slow cyclization reaction of triclosan under this condition. Contrary to dioxins, much higher levels of chlorinated triclosan derivatives were observed in the system. Almost all of them reached their highest concentrations at 120 min, and gradually decayed as reaction continued for 64 days (Table 2). Several studies have reported the production of tetraclosan 2 and 3 and pentaclosan 2 from aquatic triclosan chlorination. These three chlorinated triclosan derivatives were proposed to be formed via bimolecular electrophilic substitution of triclosan and their formation was kinetically favorable [24,25]. Results shown in Table 2 confirmed that these three chlorinated triclosans were the major degradation products of triclosan in dark in the presence of free chlorines. Besides, small amounts of tetraclosan 1 and pentaclosan 1 were also detected and the formation pathways of all measured chlorinated triclosans were proposed in Fig. 4\n[3,32]. Similar to triclosan, these chlorinated derivatives may also undergo a slow cyclization reaction in dark, which led to the formation of TrCDD and TeCDD in the system (Fig. 3).",

Triclosan decayed much faster under UV radiation than in the dark, and \u02dc90% of it reacted after 60 min of radiation (Table 1). With the same initial concentrations of triclosan and free chlorines, much more dioxins were formed under UV radiation and all of them, including 2,3,7,8-TeCDD were detected as the photo-transformation products of triclosan, given enough reaction time. Among the measured dioxin products, TrCDDs were the most abundant, followed by DCDD and TeCDDs. Concentrations of almost all dioxins increased with increasing reaction time, except for 2,8-DCDD, which peaked after 120 min of radiation and then gradually decreased as reaction continued for 16 h. This demonstrated that 2,8-DCDD was the first generation product from the photolysis of triclosan and it would further degrade to form the higher generation products. One of the possibility was 2,8-DCDD could generate a biradical intermediate upon photochemical excitation, which led to the production of dihydroxy dichlorinated biphenyls and lower chlorinated phenoxyphenols [33]. However, they were not measured in the experiments due to the lack of authentic standards.",

As shown in Fig. 5\nA, the formation yield of total dioxins under UV radiation was substantially higher than that under dark condition. This confirmed that light was the dominant factor to promote the production of dioxins from triclosan. It is interesting to note that with the same initial triclosan/active chlorine ratio, a higher yield of dioxins was observed in the experiment with lower concentrations of triclosan and free chlorines. Given that the chlorination reactions of triclosan were kinetically favorable, this phenomenon was probably due to the higher possibility for triclosan to undergo chlorination, instead of photolysis when a higher level of active chlorines was present in the system (Fig. 4) [34].",

Therefore, it was not surprising to observe that TrCDD had the highest formation yield of all three types of dioxins and TeCDD had the lowest. It was worth noting that the formation yield of pentaclosan 2 was about a thousand times higher than that of pentaclosan 1 under the same experimental conditions (Table 2). Similarly, a much lower yield of tetraclosan 1 was observed than those of tetraclosan 2 and 3. This indicated that the pathway to form 2,3,7,8-TeCDD was minor, compared with those pathways to form TrCDD and 1,2,3,8-TeCDD. However, no significant difference was observed between the yields of 1,2,3,8-TeCDD and 2,3,7,8-TeCDD (Table 1). This indicated that another photo-transformation pathway might exist for 2,3,7,8-TeCDD. Overall, the formation yields of total dioxins were rather low, which was below 1.2% under the tested conditions. As a result, a logarithmic function between the yield of dioxins and reaction time was observed (Figs. 3A, 3C and 3D).",

However, for pentaclosans, their total formation yield was much lower under UV irradiation than that in dark. This indicated that photolysis was an important pathway for the decay of pentaclosans, which might be more significant than the further chlorination of these compounds. This is because pentaclosans possess higher pKa values than that of triclosan (pKa = 7.9\u20138.1) [35,36]. In the weak basic solution, a smaller fraction of them was in the phenolate forms, and therefore less reacted with active chlorines to get further chlorinated. Besides TeCDDs, other photo-transformation products of pentaclosans could be dihydroxy polychlorinated biphenyls and lower chlorinated phenoxyphenols [33], although they were not monitored in our study. It was interesting to note that the formation yields of tetrachlosans and pentaclosans were almost the same under the two photolysis experiments. Obviously, it was the initial triclosan/active chlorine ratio but not the initial concentrations of these two precursors that really influenced the production of chlorinated triclosans from triclosan under UV irradiation.",

Higher yield of dioxins was observed in the experiment with lower concentrations of triclosan and free chlorines and TrCDDs were found to be the most abundant dioxin products.
