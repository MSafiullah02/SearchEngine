For the reverse sequence immunization regimen, lymphoproliferation, IFN-\u2425 and CTL responses were all significantly weaker compared with pcDNA3.1-N prime-rAd-N boost regimen. Conclusion: Taken together, of all the combinations, the prime-triple boost immunization of pcDNA3.1-N/pcDNA3.1-N/pcDNA3.1-N/ rAd-N can effectively induce SARS-CoV-N-specific and strong humoral and cellular immune responses in mice. The present results suggest that DNA immunization followed by recombinant adenovirus boosting could be used as a potential SARS-CoV vaccine in the induction of an enhanced humoral and cellular immune response.",

Previous studies indicate that N proteins of other coronaviruses are extensively phosphorylated, highly basic, and associated with viral RNA to form a helical ribonucleoprotein, which comprises the viral core structure. The biological function of coronavirus N protein is thought to participate in the replication and transcription of viral RNA and interfere with the cell cycle processes of the host cells. Importantly, the N protein in many coronaviruses is highly immunogenic and abundantly expressed during infection [2] [3] [4] [5] . This suggests that the N gene might be very critical in the prophylaxis and diagnosis of the SARS-CoV infection.",

Therefore, DNA vaccine approaches have been applied to generate protective immunity to various pathogens [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] , but to date the strength of the immune response induced by DNA vaccines has been relatively weak compared with conventional vaccines. A variety of strategies are being developed to increase DNA vaccine efficiency. Some approaches use the co-injection of plasmids coding for immune-enhancing genes such as interleukin-2 or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [13, 14] . Others aim to facilitate DNA uptake, such as the use of liposomes, encapsulation into microparticles, or bacteria [15] [16] [17] . However, currently one of the most successful protocols is the recombinant viral vector in combination with DNA vaccine. The advantage of such recombinant viral vaccines is their high efficacy in generating humoral and cellular immune responses. A number of different viruses, such as adenovirus, vaccinia, rabies virus, canarypox virus, simian immunodeficiency virus and murine leukemia virus, have been used to construct recombinant viral vaccines [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . Among these, the replication-defective recombinant adenovirus is viewed to be a favorably choice as a viral vector vaccine, since it appears to be both safe and to induce strong humoral and cellular antigen-specific immune responses [25] [26] [27] [28] .",

To prevent and control the re-emerging and transmission of SARS-CoV, ex-cept for inactivated vaccine experiments [32] [33] [34] , several different research reports on DNA vaccines of SARS-CoV have been recommended, such as S gene recombinant DNA vaccine [35] [36] [37] [38] , N gene recombinant DNA vaccine [39, 40] , and a combination of S, M and N gene recombinant DNA vaccines [41, 42] . These genes are delivered and expressed by different plasmids or viral vectors and elicit different levels of humoral and cellular immune responses. DNA vaccine has been shown to possess several important advantages, including the ability to induce CTLs and antibodies through the class-I and class-II antigen-processing pathways, but its efficacy does not meet our expectations [43, 44] . Different methods have been tried to increase the effectiveness of genetic immunization. Priming with a DNA vaccine can augment the efficacy of vaccines based on recombinant viral vectors. The rationale behind this strategy is that DNA priming elicits low-level but persistent immunity followed by strong boosting with virus encoding the same recombinant antigen as the DNA encodes [45] . The ability of the prime-boost regimen to induce a higher response than the DNA vaccine or virus vaccine alone may relate to the ability of recombinant adenovirus to interfere with the maturation of infected dendritic cells, decreasing their ability to present Ag to CD4 T cells, while preserving efficient Ag presentation to CD8 T cells [46, 47] . So far, the most successful DNA immunization is likely to be a consecutive immunization involving priming with plasmid DNA and boosting with recombinant virus [48] [49] [50] .",

            "text": "Several groups have concentrated on prime-boost immunization, first priming with DNA and then boosting with the live virus vector, and the reverse sequence regimen. For instance, Schneider et al. [51] demonstrated that heterologous priming immunization with plasmid DNA followed by a single boost with a recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara provided complete protection against Plasmodium berghei sporozoite challenge and induction of high levels of epitope-specific CTLs in mice, whereas other combinations, including virus followed by DNA, DNA followed by DNA, and virus followed by virus, did not induce significant protection at all. Thus, DNA priming followed by virus boosting seems to be the best regimen in prime-boost immunization. However, Matsui et al. [45] . reported that DNA prime-virus boost immunization is not absolutely superior to the reverse sequence in the induction hepatitis C virus core-specific CTLs in mice. They found that the prime-double boost immunization with pCEP4-core (DNA vaccine) priming followed by pCEP4-core and AdexlSR3ST (virus) boosts (pC/pC/aC) has a similar efficacy compared with the Fig. 6 . LDH-release assay for CTLs. Splenocytes from mice of groups 1-7 ( a ) were prepared in week 8, and groups 8-12 ( b ) were prepared in weeks 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8, respectively. Splenocytes from a single mouse of each immunized group were re-stimulated in vitro with N protein-pressible SP2/0 cells for 6 days and tested for cytolytic activity by the LDH-release assay. Cytolytic activity is defined as the specific lysis percentage and is detected at 25: 1, 50: 1 and 100: 1 of E:T cell ratios. Data on the specific lysis percentage of each group were calculated as the mean of 5 or 2 mice in each group and each experimental point represented the mean of triplicate wells. combination aC/pC/pC. Furthermore, compared to homologous vectors, heterogeneous vectors induce a strong antigen-specific immune response, and the mechanism of this may be that priming with a DNA plasmid vector seems to decrease the development of immune responses to the viral vector itself [45, 52, 53] .",

We compared the homologous prime boosting regimens and those of heterogeneous regimens, and also investigated how many boosts of pcDNA3.1-N are best after mice had been immunized with three combinations of rAd-N prime-pcDNA3.1-N boost regimen. The results of our experiments demonstrate that the DNA vaccine (pcDNA3.1-N) prime-adenovirus vector (rAd-N) boost regimen greatly enhanced the induction of a humoral and cellular immune response. In addition, in our study the rAd-N priming strategy resulted in a relatively weak induction of an immune response specific to SARS-CoV N protein, especially in the induction of CD8 T-cell response when these immunized mice were studied for their CTL activity. Regarding the ability to induce a humoral response, immunization with rAd-N/pcDNA3.1-N/pcDNA3.1-N at week 6 and immunization with rAd-N/rAd-N/pcDNA3.1-N/pcDNA3.1-N at week 8 produced similar levels of SARS-CoV-N-specific antibody response to the immunization with pcDNA3.1-N/ pcDNA3.1-N/ pcDNA3.1-N/rAd-N.",

In fact, in our study, we observed that both antibody and CTL responses were not enhanced followed the third immunization with rAd-N in the repeated rAd-N prime-pcDAN3.1-N boost regimen. Unfortunately, we were not able to detect the activities of pcDNA3.1-N prime-rAd-N boosts in the induction of humoral and cellular immune responses at weeks 0, 2, 4 and 6. With regard to the times of boost immunization, in this study immunizations with pcDNA3.1 following the rAd-N prime gave higher levels of humoral and cellular immune responses 6 weeks after the third immunization, and the fourth immunization did not enhance this significantly. Therefore, the principle of priming with rAd-N followed by pcDNA3.1-N boosts was not the more the higher, and in this study no more than three times was the better regimen against SARS-CoV infection.",

A 47-kDa band corresponding to the SARS-CoV-N protein was observed in the lane of SP2/0 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1-N, but not in the lane of pcDNA3.1-transfected cells ( fig. 2 a). Whether the recombinant adenovirus, rAd-N, could express the SARS-CoV-N protein in Vero cells was examined. Vero cells infected with rAd-N or rAd-LacZ were lysed and subjected to Western blot analysis. As demonstrated in figure 2 a. A 47-kDa band corresponding to the SARS-CoV-N protein was clearly detected in rAd-N-infected cells, but not observed in rAd-LacZ-infected Vero cells.ELISA Assay and Western Blot Analysis of the Anti-SARS-CoV-N IgG AntibodySARS-CoV-N-specific antibody response was assessed using the standard ELISA kit for diagnosis of SARS-CoV infection. When the sera from immunized mice were separated at week 8 (groups 1-7) or at weeks 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 (groups[8][9][10][11][12]. The mean antibody levels of the different immunized groups in the induction of an N-protein-specific antibody response were detected and the results are shown infigure 3, and among those 7 groups, the maximum 1.258 8 0.231 was induced by a combination of pcDNA3.1-N/pcDNA3.1-induction of SARS-CoV-N-specific antibody response than the two homologous combinations of pcDNA3.1-N/pcDNA3.1-N/pcDNA3.1-N/pcDNA3.1-N and rAd-N/rAd-N/rAd-N/rAd-N at week 8 (fig. 3 a;p ! 0.05). After the mice of groups 8-12 had been sacrificed at 2-week intervals from week 0 to week 8, we observed that titers (fig. 3 b)of anti-N antibody increased to the maximum 1.209 8 0.043 in week 6 after the mice had been immunized with rAd-N/pcDNA3.1-N /pcDNA3.1-N (group 10), but at week 8 these three heterogeneous combinations of rAd-N/rAd-N/rAd-N/pcDNA3.1-N, rAd-N/rAd-N/pcDNA3.1-N/pcDNA3.1-N, and rAd-N/ pcDNA3.1-N/pcDNA3.1-N/pcDNA3.1-N were not found to be significantly increased (p 1 0.05). They were equivalent or less when compared with the antibody levels at week 6. Among all humoral immune response experiments, the combination of pcDNA3.1-N/pcDNA3.1-N/ pcDNA3.1-N/rAd-N induced the highest SARS-CoV-Nspecific antibody response at week 8 in BALB/c mice and rAd-N/pcDNA3.1-N/pcDNA3.1-N did so at week 6 (p 1 0.05).",
