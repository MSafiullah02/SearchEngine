            "text": "A purification protocol is described herein for concurrent isolation of two defense proteins including a 6-kDa defensinlike antifungal peptide and a 60-kDa dimeric hemagglutinin from seeds of the French bean (Phaseolus vulgaris). It involved ion-exchange chromatography on SP-Sepharose, affinity chromatography on Affi-gel blue gel, ion-exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose, and gel filtration on Superdex Peptide (for defensin-like antifungal peptide) or Superdex 200 (for hemagglutinin). Both antifungal and hemagglutinating activities were adsorbed on SP-Sepharose and then on Affi-gel blue gel. Hemagglutinin was subsequently unadsorbed and defensin-like antifungal peptide adsorbed on Q-Sepharose. The antifungal activity of the antifungal peptide was stable in the temperature range of 0-90\u00b0C for 20 min, in the pH range of 4-10, and after exposure to trypsin (1 mg/ml) at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. The hemagglutinin was stable from 10 to 80\u00b0C, from pH 1 to 12, and after treatment with trypsin at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. It inhibited [methyl-3 H]thymidine incorporation into breast cancer (MCF-7), leukemia (L1210), hepatoma (HepG2) and human embryonic liver (WRL68) cells with an IC 50 of 6.6, 7, 13 and 15 \u00b5M, respectively, and elicited maximal mitogenic response from mouse splenocytes at 1 \u00b5M concentration. It curtailed HIV-1 reverse transcriptase activity with an IC 50 of 1.9 \u00b5M, but was devoid of antifungal activity.",

Cation-exchange chromatography on a 2.5 \u00d7 16 cm column of SP-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was carried out. After removal of unadsorbed proteins (fraction SP1), adsorbed proteins were eluted sequentially with 0.2 M NaCl and 1 M NaCl in 10 mM NH 4 OAc buffer (pH 4.5) into fractions SP2 and SP3, respectively. Fraction SP3 was dialyzed extensively against distilled water. Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) was added till a final concentration of 10 mM Tris was reached. SP3 was then applied on a 2.5 \u00d7 16 cm column of Affi-gel blue gel (Bio-Rad) that had previously been equilibrated with and was eluted with 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4). After unadsorbed proteins (fraction BG1) had come off the column, adsorbed proteins (fraction BG2) were desorbed with 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1 M NaCl. Fraction BG2 was dialyzed against distilled water before addition of concentrated NH 4 HCO 3 solution to produce a final concentration of 10 mM NH 4 HCO 3 .

The antifungal and hemagglutinating activities in fraction SP3 were recovered in fraction BG2 adsorbed on Affi-gel blue gel. The traces of unadsorbed materials in fraction BG1 lacked antifungal and hemagglutinating activities (data not shown). Upon chromatography on Q-Sepharose fraction, BG2 appeared as a very small unadsorbed peak and a single adsorbed peak that was eluted by 1 M NaCl in the starting buffer (data not shown). The tiny unadsorbed peak from Q-Sepharose was chromatographed on Superdex Peptide to yield a single 6-kDa peak that represented purified defensin-like antifungal peptide (data not shown). The adsorbed peak on Q-Sepharose, which yielded a single 60-kDa peak after gel filtration on Superdex 200 (data not shown) and appeared as a single band with a molecular mass of 30 kDa in SDS-PAGE (data not shown), represented purified hemagglutinin.

French bean hemagglutinin closely resembled lectins/hemagglutinins from other P. vulgaris cultivars and Phaseolus species in N -terminal sequence ( Table 2 ). The defensin-like antifungal peptide which exhibited a molecular mass of 6 kDa ( Figure 2 ) inhibited mycelial growth in M. arachidicola. The peptide also exerted antifungal activity toward V. mali and R. solani ( Figure 3 ) with an IC 50 of 3 and 4.5 \u00b5M, respectively. The antifungal peptide lacked inhibitory activity toward HIV-1 integrase and SARS proteinase. Only a single amino acid residue was detected in each sequencing cycle for both French bean hemagglutinin and defensin-like antifungal peptide. The antifungal activity was stable in the pH range of 0-90\u00b0C for 20 min, in the pH range of 4-10, and after exposure to trypsin (1 mg/ml) at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. The hemagglutinin retained its hemagglutinating activity after exposure for 30 min to various temperatures from 0 to 80\u00b0C and various pH values from 1 to 12. However, there was a complete loss of activity at and above 90\u00b0C, and at pH 13 and 14 and pH <1 (data not shown). Full retention of activity after exposure to trypsin (1 mg/ml) for 15, 30, 60 and 120 min at 37\u00b0C was noted (data not shown). The activity could not be inhibited by any of the following sugars at 800 mM concentration: arabinose, fructose, fucose, galactose, galacturonic acid, glucosamine, glucose, mannose, melibiose, raffinose, rhamnose, sorbitol, sucrose and xylose. The hemagglutinin evoked mitogenic response from mouse splenocytes with the maximal response hemagglutinin-stimulated (uptake of 4000 cpm of radiolabeled thymidine compared with 1500 cpm of basal uptake) observed at a hemagglutinin concentration of 1 \u00b5M. The subsequent decline in mitogenic activity was similar to previous observations on other lectins. However, the hemagglutinin did not affect nitric oxide production by mouse macrophages. It inhibited proliferation of various tumor cell lines including L1210, HepG2 and MCF-7 and embryonic liver cell line WRL-68 with an IC 50 of 6.6, 7, 13 and 15 \u00b5M, respectively. It inhibited HIV-1 reverse transcriptase with an IC 50 of 1.9 \u00b5M (detailed data not shown), but was incapable of inhibiting HIV-1 integrase, SARS proteinase and mycelial growth (data not shown).",

Previously, a thaumatin-like antifungal protein, and a peroxidase-like antifungal protein from the French bean have been described [4, 5] . French bean defensin-like antifungal peptide resembles previously isolated plant defensin-like peptides in Nterminal sequence, molecular mass, chromatographic behavior on Affi-gel blue gel and ion exchangers, stability to trypsin, pH stability and thermostability [14, 18] . However, it lacks inhibitory activity toward HIV-I integrase and SARS proteinase. Hemagglutinins/lectins, produced by French bean and other cultivars of P. vulgaris including pinto bean, red kidney bean, haricot bean and flageolet bean possess highly homologous but not identical N -terminal sequences. Lectins from other Phaseolus species also demonstrate similar N -terminal sequences. Lectins/hemagglutinins from French bean, flageolet bean, red kidney bean and pinto bean are dimeric but haricot bean hemagglutinin is tetrameric although the subunit molecular mass for all of them is approximately 30 kDa. With regard to sugar specificity, the hemagglutinating activity of hemagglutinins from French bean and other P. vulgaris cultivars cannot be inhibited by simple sugars whereas pinto bean lectin is galactose-specific. French bean hemagglutinin exhibits antiproliferative activity toward tumor cells like hemagglutinins from red kidney bean, haricot bean, and flageolet bean [3, 9, 19] . However, pinto bean",

            "text": "lectin is devoid of antiproliferative activity. Mitogenic activity toward mouse splenocytes is a common feature of all these lectins/hemagglutinins. Unlike banana lectin [16] , French bean hemagglutinin is not capable of augmenting nitric oxide production by mouse macrophages. In contrast to findings about the antifungal activity of some lectins [3] , French bean hemagglutinin is destitute of antifungal activity just like its counterparts from pinto bean and haricot bean.Some lectins inhibit HIV-1 replication. French bean hemagglutinin manifests HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitory activity (IC 50 = 1.9 \u00b5M) which is slightly more potent than that of pinto bean lectin (IC 50 = 3 \u00b5M). However, it does not inhibit HIV-1 integrase, unlike some of the milk proteins, antifungal proteins and ribosome inactivating proteins tested. It is also inactive against SARS proteinase. French bean hemagglutinin is stable over the temperature range 0-80\u00b0C and over the pH range 1-12. Its hemagglutinating activity is preserved after exposure to trypsin for 2 h, indicating that it does not have accessible lysine or arginine residues where cleavage and inactivation can occur or it may have dibasic pairs that are not cleaved. It is slightly more stable than pinto bean lectin which retains its hemagglutinating activity over the pH range 3-12 and the temperature range 0-70\u00b0C.In summary, a highly efficient chromatographic procedure using SP-Sepharose chromatography initially for isolating French bean hemagglutinin and defensinlike antifungal peptide has been described herein. It is demonstrated in this study that lectins/hemagglutinins from different cultivars of a species are not identical in amino acid sequence and biological potency. French bean hemagglutinin isolated in the present study is fairly stable and biologically potent and possesses potentially exploitable activities. In addition, a defensin-like antifungal peptide has been isolated from French bean seeds. Previously a thaumatin-like protein and a peroxidase-like antifungal protein have been purified from French bean legumes. The antifungal activity of defensin toward R. solani and V. mali is first demonstrated in this study. Transgenic plants expressing French been defensin would be expected to have a stronger resistance to fungal pathogens. French bean hemagglutinin, which is relatively stable to trypsin and a variety of pH values and temperatures, and exhibit mitogenic activity toward splenocytes and antiproliferative activity, may have health-promoting effects in human.",
