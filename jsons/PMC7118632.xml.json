As we know, preparedness for the epidemic spread is a primary public health concern for any health department. Epidemic reporting of a disease is a fundamental event in understanding two key parameters in epidemiology, namely, epidemic diffusion within a population and growth at a population level. Normally, for a real-time epidemic, the reporting of cases is rarely complete, especially if the epidemic is new or symptoms are unknown or are yet to be discovered. For viruses with shorter incubation periods without virus shedding during the incubation period, any delay in reporting or lack of reporting could lead to a severe epidemic due to the absence of control measures. For example, for the Ebola virus, the average incubation period is between 2 and 21 days, and an individual diagnosed with the Ebola virus does not spread the virus to others during this period. If some of these individuals with Ebola are not diagnosed (and hence not reported to health care facilities) then after 21 days, these individuals will (unknowingly) spread the virus to others. There are other viruses whose incubation period is short but they are contagious during this period, for example, influenza. Even for epidemics with established symptoms, reporting could be nowhere close to complete. The impact of reporting on epidemic surveillance can then be theoretically measured (Rao, 2012).",

The observations by Bartlett (1957) on population size and the fraction of measles infecting people over various time points provided a new basis for using stochastic models for understanding retrospectively the seasonality of epidemics. This study by Bartlett (1957) and other studies (for example, see the summary in the book by Anderson and May, 1991) consider wave-like fitting of a time series data of epidemics. Bartlett, in his articles Bartlett, 1956, Bartlett, 1957 considered two differential equations to investigate small oscillations around the equilibrium. Earlier than this, a stochastic formulation of such models was seen by Soper in his paper Soper (1929).",

Fitting wave functions from time series data on epidemics, the researchers also focused on constructing specific wavelets as part of the epidemiology modeling, for example, Morlet\u2019 s wave functions (Grenfell, Bj\u00f8 rnstad, Kappey, 2001, Bauch, Earn, 2003, Bauch, Earn, 2003, Bauch, 2008, Cazelles, Cazelles, Chavez, 2014).

Our approach will be useful in deep learning of very large data structures and creating complete data from partial data. During most of the emerging epidemics, we will be handling only partial data, corresponding full data would be seldom available.

That is, the sum of the epidemic cases that were reported during (ti\u22121,ti] and those reported during each of the future time intervals (ti,ti+1] for i=2,3,\u2026,n\u22121 and that belong to the interval (ti\u22121,ti] will be treated as an improved number of reported cases for the interval (ti\u22121,ti]. We will update the reported number of cases in a previous interval from the future available reported cases that were associated with the previous time interval. Hence the evolution of the data for the interval (ti\u22121,ti] can be used to construct graphs as shown in Fig. 4.5. Since this evolution is assumed to be observed for a long period, it is also assumed that Gi will be approximately convergent to Gic. As an epidemic progresses, we will update the intervals (ti\u22121,ti] with newly available information during (ti,ti+1] and as i approaches n then those intervals nearby to n will have less of a chance of evolution or less chance of up-gradation (due to a truncation effect). Once the reported numbers are complete, we will similarly study the recovery stage of an epidemic and hence collect the data to compute Fig. 4.6. Accumulation of old cases in new intervals distributed back to the respective time intervals is schematically described in Fig. 4.7. This procedure will update the reported cases in the past as long as at least one reported case observed in the present time interval belongs to one of the past time intervals. Based on the location of the reported cases the graphs constructed will be updated as well. Hence for each present time interval that we observe a reported case that belongs to one of the past time intervals, the fractional wavelets will become graphically closer to the complete (or true) wavelet for that time interval.",

The wavelets act robustly in our situation and hence the pictorial differences between the three wavelets of Fig. 5.2 are minimal. Yet the differences in patterns is definitely present because of the order of the various wavelets. The ai values are taken from each of the numerical examples or a real epidemic data collected.

We have newly introduced the phrase fractional epidemic waves in this work. This fractional epidemic waves concept we are using with other ideas explained in this paper to develop new ideas related to fractional wavelets. In a sense, fractional wavelets represent fractions of an overall wavelet. This figure serves as a foundational concept to link the idea of fractional reporting waves with reporting errors.",

We drew graphs using black colored filled circles in this Figure to represent total reported cases in a few of the situations out of all possible diseases reporting patterns. The sample point of reported cases represents the total reported cases at each time interval. Hence the size of all graphs at each interval was kept the same. Similarly, the size of graphs between different time intervals is kept different for demonstration purposes only and actual reported cases between different time intervals could be constant or not. During the intervals [tn\u22121,tn], the number of vertices helped to form graph are constant within each time interval (7 in [t0, t1], 10 in (t1, t2] but actual structure of the network has changed between various graphs in each time interval.",
