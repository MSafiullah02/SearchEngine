Development of mucosal immune responses to antigens continues through infancy and early childhood (Chapter 11) (Cripps et al., 1987, Ogra, 2010), at a time when eustachian tube morphology increases the child\u2019s risk of otopathogen access to the middle ear and development of otitis media (OM) (Lim, 1976, Bluestone and Doyle, 1988). Furthermore, infants and children experiencing gastroesophageal reflux may have increased risk of OM due to ongoing upregulation of mucosal responses by the presence of pepsin within the eustachian tube and middle ear. Pepsin is reported to stimulate middle ear inflammation and increase the risk of chronic otitis media with effusion (COME) (Miura et al., 2012). Infancy and early childhood are the periods of highest incidence of OM, with the peak incidence of acute otitis media (AOM) occurring in the first 6 months of life and the recurrence of OM being common up to 7 years of age (Ogra, 2010).",

The mucosal epithelium within the epitympanic region is composed primarily of squamous epithelia with islands of ciliated columnar cells. These islands form a functional mucociliary pathway from the mastoid antrum in the epitympanum, through the mesotympanum, toward the eustachian tube. Similarly, the squamous epithelium of the mesotympanum has two paths of ciliated columnar cells, one continuing the path from the epitympanum and mastoid antrum and the other connecting the tympanic membrane through the hypotympanum to the eustachian tube.",

The number of ciliated columnar epithelial cells in the mucosal lining progressively increases toward the eustachian tube to constitute about 80% of the cells adjacent to the eustachian tube entrance. These histomorphological changes evidence the progressive transformation from flat, nonsecretory squamous epithelium to respiratory epithelium that is pseudostratified, ciliated columnar cells just proximal to the eustachian tube entrance (Bluestone and Doyle, 1988, Lim, 1976, Lim, 1979, Ars et al., 2012). The changing cellular architecture of the middle ear cavity facilitates function of an organized mucociliary transportation system from primarily the epitympanum and hypotympanum to the eustachian tube, as illustrated in Figure 1.",

These epithelial cells are ciliated and, in addition to goblet cells, also secrete mucus (Lim, 1979). Within the middle ear and eustachian tube, secretory glands secrete two types of mucus: mucoid and serous (Lim, 1979). Serous fluid is less viscous and is considered the origin of the periciliary fluid that aids mucociliary clearance of these regions. (For review, see Lim (1979).) Mucoid secretion also provides lubrication of the epithelial cell boundary of the mucosal membrane (Ueno and Lim, 1991) and together, the glandular and mucosal epithelial cells in these regions are the front line for secretion of molecules of innate immunity (Lim, 1976, Lim, 1979, Lim et al., 2000). For example, in children, mucoid effusions from chronically infected middle ears contain higher concentrations of lysozyme, an antimicrobial enzyme (Liu et al., 1975) that was localized to middle ear epithelial goblet cells (Lim et al., 1976) and has been demonstrated to reduce susceptibility to OM in the murine model (Shimada et al., 2008).",

To assist mucociliary clearance of the middle ear, the epithelium of the epitympanum, although primarily squamous, is well vascularized and performs a gas exchange role with the mastoid and middle ear cavities. Intermittent opening of the eustachian tube, during swallowing and yawning, in conjunction with the mastoid antrum gas pressurization, improves clearance of secretions from the middle ear into the nasopharynx (Ars et al., 2012, Lim, 1976, Bluestone and Doyle, 1988, Marom et al., 2012, Lim, 1979).",

Mast cells and macrophages are the most commonly observed immunocompetent cell types in non-inflamed tissue, with mast cells predominant in healthy middle ears. Mast cells are preferentially distributed in the well-vascularized mucosa or ciliated mucosal epithelial layer of the tubotympanum rather than within the subepithelial layer (Palva et al., 1991, Watanabe et al., 1991). Immunocompetent cell numbers progressively fall as the healthy middle ear is approached from the nasopharynx via the eustachian tube (Widemar et al., 1986, Watanabe et al., 1991). Electron microscopic examination of the human tympanic membrane reported non-epithelial cells within the basal epidermis (Yamanaka, 1987) that have been subsequently identified as dendritic cells (DC) (Freijd et al., 1984). The presence of these antigen presenting cells (APC) within the normal tympanic membrane, albeit sourced from cadaveric specimens, suggests a mechanism for local initiation of a primary immune response. DC and upregulation of cytokine secretion are recognized as elements of the local immunological response of the tympanic membrane to chronic OM and perforation (Corscadden et al., 2013).",

Viral infection of the upper respiratory tract mucosae, reported in prospective human studies, often precedes and predisposes the middle ear cavity to development of OM (Mandel et al., 2008). During one 12-month prospective study, 97% of children aged 6 months to 3 years experienced one or more URI per year, with approximately 10% of children less than 3 years of age experiencing 10 or more infections. AOM was identified in 61% of children experiencing a URI while otitis media with effusion (OME) was observed in 25% of children, with child age being the strongest predictor (Chonmaitree et al., 2008). It is not uncommon for children to experience six to eight URI per year (Heikkinen and Jarvinen, 2003), and approximately 70% of children with a diagnosis of OM have symptoms of a URI. Furthermore, approximately 77% of these children have a virus detected in their nasal secretions (Mandel et al., 2008, Winther et al., 2007). Adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A and influenza B virus, parainfluenza virus, coronavirus, enterovirus, and rhinoviruses are commonly associated with OM (Heikkinen and Chonmaitree, 2003, Alper et al., 2009).",

Although viruses are a commonly detected microbe within the middle ear fluid (MEF) from children with OM, there is recent debate as to whether viral presence equates to OM pathogenesis (Chonmaitree et al., 2012). Viruses have been detected in 70% of MEF samples from children with AOM and viral detection alone was observed in only 4% of cases, with 66% of children exhibiting concurrent viral and bacterial infections. Only 26% of the AOM cases exhibited bacterial infection alone (Ruohola et al., 2006); however, viral infection of the upper airways does have a critical role in the pathogenesis of bacterial OM. A number of studies using combined viral and bacterial otopathogens in the chinchilla model have been recently reviewed (Bakaletz, 2010) and confirm that a highly specific interrelationship exists between a respiratory tract viral infection and the bacteria associated with OM as recognized in children (Heikkinen, 2000, Chonmaitree et al., 2008). This relationship varies depending upon the otopathogens involved; for example, in Moraxella catarrhalis-induced OM, more than one viral or bacterial co-pathogen may be necessary for OM establishment. Viral/bacterial partnership (interrelationship) facilitates the transfer of nasopharyngeal commensal bacteria into the middle ear via the eustachian tube and increases the risk and severity of bacterial OM infection (Garcia-Rodriguez and Fresnadillo Martinez, 2002). A review on the bacterial and viral interactions on the development of AOM has been recently published (Marom et al., 2012).",

Upper respiratory tract viruses also stimulate increased expression of eukaryotic receptors such as intercellular adhesion molecule 1, carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1, and platelet-activating factor receptor on the mucosal or host cell surface (Griffiths et al., 2007). Bacteria use these surface receptors as adherence sites and to alter rates of mucus secretion. Viral infection also stimulates innate mucosal immune responses, including inflammation and mucosal membrane thickening and increased mucus secretion by goblet cells, leading to reduced middle ear pressurization (Giebink et al., 1987). These local immune responses in the middle ear and eustachian tube have been clearly associated with enhanced susceptibility to OM in the chinchilla model and have been recently reviewed (Bakaletz, 2010).",

Group A Streptococcus is also reported as an otopathogen (Segal et al., 2005) and Alloiococcus otiditis is reported as a significant otopathogen in some population groups (Ashhurst-Smith et al., 2012). Mucosal immune responses within the middle ear and eustachian tube may be overwhelmed by the extent of early bacterial colonization and result in unresolved inflammation within the middle ear. For example, the nasopharyngeal carriage rate for NTHi is higher in children with OME compared to healthy children. Children who experience dense bacterial colonization of the nasopharynx early in life are at significantly increased risk of early OM development and more severe disease, including tympanic membrane perforation, and are at very high risk of suppurative complications of OM (Leach et al., 1994, Smith-Vaughan et al., 2006). Effective mucosal immune responses within the middle ear may reduce the impact of bacterial load and/or virulence of the otopathogen. For example, single gene deletion of slrA (streptococcal lipoprotein rotamase A) or in combination with ppmA gene (putative proteinase maturation protein A) significantly reduced bacterial load and virulence in the nasopharynx and middle ear in a murine experimental AOM model (Stol et al., 2009). The additive effects of deletion of these genes on bacterial colonization and virulence provides further challenge for vaccine development.",

Multi-species bacterial biofilms containing these species have been visualized on the middle ear mucosa and characterized using confocal microscopy. The presence of multiple bacterial species, within the same middle ear mucosal samples, could provide additional protection to each microbe, protecting them from host innate and acquired immune defenses (Armbruster et al., 2010).

Each pathogen may produce a variety of PAMP molecules including proteins, lipoproteins, lipids, and nucleic acids and thus may activate multiple signaling pathways. A recent study reported upregulated expression of genes involved with non-self DNA sensing via the TLR9, DAI, Pol-III, and AIM2 receptors in the middle ear mucosa of mice following NTHi infection and confirmed their role in bacterial DNA recognition of NTHi induction of OM in this model (Leichtle et al., 2012a). These multiple parallel pathways for DNA signaling during the early innate immune responses to pathogens within the middle ear indicates potential synergistic and/or redundant activation mechanisms to the same pathogen via stimulation via a number of PRRs.

Cross-talk between these molecules may optimize activation of innate immune responses such as inflammation, but also facilitates attenuation of signaling to minimize the risk of local tissue damage. Evidence of the complexity of TLR-induced signaling in response to NTHi-induced OM in the mouse is explored in a 2011 review (Leichtle et al., 2011).

            "text": "A significant body of research has been undertaken using a variety of animal models to explore middle ear immune responses and signaling pathways in NTHi-induced OM. In brief, NTHi activates both TLR2 and TLR4 receptors that recruit and activate TLR adaptor molecules, myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88), and cytoplasmic Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing adaptor-inducing IFN-\u03b2 (TRIF), respectively. NTHi stimulation of NOD-2 receptors in the cytoplasm can also activate the MyD88-dependent pathway used by all the TLRs (except TLR3), resulting in proinflammatory cytokine production via activation of NF-\u03baB and/or mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and/or Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK). In contrast, TLR4 activation of the TRIF pathway stimulates type 1 interferon and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production through IFN regulatory factor 3 and acts to delay expression of other inflammatory cytokines. Recently, host cell recognition of M. catarrhalis has also been reported to use multiple TLR receptors, including TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9, in addition to the membrane-bound CD14-TLR4 complex. Activation of these receptors results in subsequent activation of both MyD88- and TRIF-dependent pathways within the host innate immune responses. MAPK activation leads to upregulation of TNF\u03b1 secretion and, together with IL-6, these proinflammatory cytokines are necessary to reduce bacterial loads in TLR4 mutant C3H/HeJ mice (Hassan et al., 2012). Different otopathogens may upregulate host inflammatory responses via similar PRRs and signaling pathways, although extensive investigation of NTHi infection demonstrates that a number of different signaling pathways may cooperatively activate host immune responses, as illustrated in Figure 2\n. NTHi infection also activates the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway through transmembrane receptors and stimulates phosphorylation of Mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 2 (SMAD2/3) protein, which relocates the SMAD/2/3/4 complex to the nucleus. The SMAD/2/3/4 complex, together with transcription factor, triggers expression of genes involved with extracellular matrix formation, which is an important regulator of tissue remodeling within the middle ear during OM (Lee et al., 2011). Viral otopathogens are detected via a variety of PRRs, for example, single-stranded RNA of influenzavirus stimulates TLR7 (mouse) and TLR8 (human) PRRs within the endosome. Furthermore, genomic RNA can be detected in the cytoplasm by RIG-1, which signals, via IRF3/7 and NF-\u03baB transcription factors, upregulation of inflammatory cytokines and type 1 interferons (Takeuchi and Akira, 2010). NACHT domain, leucine-rich-repeat and PYD-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasomes have a role in detection of the M2 protein of influenzavirus and then activate caspase-1, facilitating production of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2, IL-18, and IL-33 (Ichinohe et al., 2010).",

These roles have been demonstrated using NTHi inoculation in W/Wv mice, which lack mast cells, and it was estimated that up to half the strength of early mucosal inflammatory response to NTHi results from mast cell degranulation (Ebmeyer et al., 2005, Pajor et al., 2011). Importantly, mast cell-independent factors including proinflammatory cytokines TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-8 may dominate responses in the longer term (Smirnova et al., 2002). Reconstitution of the mast cell population in these knockout mice restored the mucosal response, and together these findings support the mast cell role as a cellular sentinel in the normal innate response in the middle ear mucosa. In humans, the presence of increased density of tryptase-positive mast cells within granulation tissue in the middle ear mucosa of patients with chronic OM is associated with poorer postoperative healing and increased risk of OM recurrence (Pajor et al., 2011).",

Furthermore, these otopathogens can act synergistically to upregulate MUC5AC transcription by activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 3/6 (MKK3/6 p38) and ERK MAPK pathways (Shen et al., 2008). Human middle ear epithelium expresses many of the known mucin genes, including MUC1, MUC2, MUC3, MUC4, MUC5AC, MUC5B, MUC7, MUC8, MUC9, MUC11, MUC13, MUC15, MUC16, MUC18, MUC19, and MUC20 (Kerschner, 2007). Human middle ear epithelial (HMEEC) cell lines have provided considerable evidence of identification and regulation of intracellular signaling pathways in response to S. pneumoniae and NTHi infection and indicate that predominantly MUC5AC is the mucin upregulated (Shen et al., 2008, Komatsu et al., 2008, Lim et al., 2009, Lee et al., 2012). In contrast, evidence from COM patients suggests that MUC5B upregulation was predominant over MUC5AC and that MUC2, MUC19, and MUC7 were not detected in the MEE (Preciado et al., 2010). Recent cell-culture evidence suggests that MUC1 mucin upregulation in A549 airway epithelial cells may help control inflammation during infection with NTHi through suppression of TLR2 signaling and reduced IL-8 production (Kyo et al., 2012). These findings suggest a potential anti-inflammatory role for MUC1 mucin in OM pathogenesis.",

Aquaporins 1, 4, and 5 are expressed in the rat eustachian tube and middle ear epithelium and are localized within the subepithelial fibroblasts, basolateral membranes of the ciliated epithelial cells, and apical surface of the serous glands (Kang et al., 2007), respectively.

Heat-killed NTHi injected into the middle ear resulted in downregulation of the majority of middle ear aquaporin genes in the murine model (Macarthur et al., 2011a); thus NTHi infection within the middle ear may contribute to effusion by this mechanism.",

In contrast, most of the 24 inner ear ion homeostasis genes examined were downregulated during the inflammation, particularly aquaporin and Na+, K+-ATPase genes, which supports the early transudation of fluid into the middle ear. While the proinflammatory cytokine gene expression returned to normal over the following week, ion homeostasis genes remained downregulated, perhaps in response to the fluid within the middle ear (Macarthur et al., 2011b), which might help to explain why middle ear effusion persists after the infection is cleared.\n",

The importance of antimicrobial peptides within the middle ear mucosa to reduce middle ear colonization and invasion has been demonstrated in the chinchilla model. In this model, inoculation with an NTHi mutant, NTHi sapA, that exhibits an increased sensitivity to an antimicrobial protein, recombinant chinchilla \u03b2-defensin 1 (cBD-1), a human-defensin 3 homolog, resulted in OM disease attenuation and reduced bacterial survival (Mason et al., 2005). Antimicrobial proteins perform both bactericidal and nonbactericidal actions to maintain normal middle ear function. For example, small interfering RNA knockdown of short palate, lung, and nasal epithelium clone 1 (SPLUNC1) in the chinchilla did not alter NTHi survival in the middle ear but demonstrated that expression of SPLUNC1 peptide was essential for maintenance of normal mucociliary clearance and middle ear pressurization (Mcgillivary and Bakaletz, 2010).",

Lysozyme rapidly accumulates within the MEE, within 6 h of experimental NTHi infection. Accumulation of lysozyme occurs approximately 6 h before inflammatory cell influx in the guinea pig model (Kawana, 1995). Furthermore, MEE concentrations of lysozyme are higher in children with mucoid OM compared to children experiencing serous OM (Harada et al., 1990, Liu et al., 1975), and lysozyme secretion was localized to middle ear goblet cells in children (Lim et al., 1976). In contrast, lysozyme was localized to the serous glands and epithelial cells and middle ear mucosa in the chinchilla (Hanamure and Lim, 1986). Lysozyme knockout mice (M\u2212/\u2212) are more susceptible to pathogen colonization of the middle ear and develop a more severe middle ear inflammatory response after exposure to S. pneumoniae 6B infection (Shimada et al., 2008), thus supporting the antibacterial role of lysozyme within the middle ear. Furthermore, human lysozyme can act synergistically with \u03b2-defensin 2 to reduce S. pneumoniae 6B viability by directly killing the invading pathogen (Lee et al., 2004). Clearly, antimicrobial proteins such as lysozyme may act both independently and together to prevent bacterial colonization and maintain normal function of the middle ear.",

Innate immune responses are rapidly induced in response to otopathogens in a nonspecific manner through stimulation of a variety of cell signaling pathways, including local production of inflammatory cytokines and type I interferons (Takeuchi and Akira, 2010). Investigation of the expression of inflammatory cytokine gene expression in the middle ear has been investigated using a number of animal models, including the AOM murine model induced by trans-tympanic injection of S. pneumoniae. In this model, AOM mice demonstrated upregulation of IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, TNF\u03b1, and IL-6, with IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 predominant 24 h after administration of the pathogen (Macarthur et al., 2011b). Examination of chronic OM, using a spontaneously induced OM murine model, the C3H/HEJ mouse (defective TLR4 thus mounts an ineffective immune response to gram-negative bacteria), showed further increase of the upregulation of IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and TNF\u03b1 but also demonstrated cytokine genes related to tissue remodeling (TNF\u03b1, FGF, BMP) and angiogenesis (VEGF) (Macarthur et al., 2011b). Together, these studies emphasize the intricate control and progressive modification of cytokine gene expression during both the initial and chronic inflammatory responses to otopathogens in the middle ear and their potential role in chronic OM pathogenesis. These responses reduce the opportunity for bacterial adherence to the mucosa and activate adaptive immune responses to upregulate acquired immune responses to then further reduce pathogen invasion within the middle ear mucosa.",

Antigen-specific IgA-producing cells have been identified in the inflamed middle ear; however, other immunoglobulin isotypes are also present. In a study of the anti-NTHi P6 antibody profiles in MEE from children who were prone to OM, but undergoing an acute or subacute infection episode due to NTHi, it was demonstrated that 92% of the MEEs were positive for IgG anti-P6 antibody, 78% for IgA, 70% for IgM, and 45% for SIgA. While the level of IgG, IgA, and IgM anti-P6 antibodies correlated well with those observed in serum, SIgA levels did not (Yamanaka and Faden, 1993). Interestingly, the MEF from patients with AOM has been reported to show higher IgA concentrations compared to blood samples from patients with OME, while IgM and IgG concentrations are less in MEF compared to serum (Sloyer et al., 1976, Yamanaka et al., 1987). Another report indicates that IgG and IgA concentrations within the serum and MEF concentrations are reduced in patients with recurrent OME compared to control patients (Yeo et al., 2008). No significant differences have been reported in serum IgA, IgA2, IgG, and IgG2 between children 3\u201310 years of age, regardless of whether they have OME or not (Drake-Lee et al., 2003). To our knowledge, no studies have reported more comprehensive IgA subclass profiles in MEEs or serum within otitis-prone children. Furthermore, a recent report indicates a nonsignificant increase in MEF IgA levels against the pneumococcal IgA-1 protease protein in S. pneumoniae-negative/COME-positive children, which may indicate a role in improving the binding of IgA to improve bacterial clearance. This study also reported evidence of a positive correlation between antigen-specific serum and MEE IgG levels for both M. catarrhalis and S. pneumoniae antibodies, which suggests that the antibody response in the middle ear is derived from both the systemic circulation and local mucosal tissue in the middle ear (Verhaegh et al., 2012).",

Furthermore, children experiencing recurrent AOM can produce adequate IgG, IgG1, and IgG2 responses against pneumococcal polysaccharides induced by either vaccination or natural exposure (Corscadden et al., 2013). Unfortunately, children with low levels of nasopharyngeal SIgA-specific anti-P6 antibodies are unable to reduce the density of NTHi colonization, irrespective of the load of initial NTHi colonization (Harabuchi et al., 1994), and in these children, the frequency of OM was directly related to the frequency of NTHi colonization. Subsequent studies, however, do support a relationship between the concentration of specific antibody responses following natural exposure to common otopathogens in serum and MEF in children who are prone to recurrent AOM (Berman et al., 1992, Sharma et al., 2011, Straetemans et al., 2005). Indeed, rapid inactivation and clearance of pathogenic bacteria are observed in children where elevated specific serum antibodies, particularly IgG, are identified (Freijd et al., 1985); however, recurrent OM remains a key clinical indicator for identifying children with potential immunodeficiency (Wilson and Hogan, 2008).",

In these models, the relative paucity of immunocompetent cells within the middle ear mucosa was significantly increased within 24 h of otopathogen administration to the middle ear. In response to immune stimulation, lymphocytes have been reported to enter the middle ear mucosa from a variety of lymphatic sources as determined using chromium-51-labeled lymphocytes in guinea pig (Ryan et al., 1990). A subsequent study examined lymphocytes in the MEE of children experiencing either OME or adenoid hypertrophy and reported that the adenoid may be a primary source for T lymphocytes that can home to middle ear mucosa during immune response to antigenic challenge and that the majority of these cells were CD45RO+, that is, expressed the memory phenotype (Mattila et al., 2000). Furthermore, the hypothesis that local proliferation of lymphocytes occurs within the middle ear mucosa (Takahashi et al., 1992) has been examined during AOM in the rat model using the DNA precursor bromodeoxyuridine to label proliferating leukocytes. Within the middle ear mucosa, the local proliferation rate ranged between 2% and 9% within immunocyte subsets (Jecker et al., 2001).",

Furthermore, it has been reported that the proportion of Foxp3+CD4+ CD25+T/CD4+ T cells in the blood of adults with COME was significantly higher than that observed in acute OME, but also higher than that in normal volunteers, which may indicate a role of Treg immunosuppression in the persistence of middle ear infection (Zhao et al., 2009). Alternatively, Treg cells during chronic middle ear effusion may perform a significant role in the homeostatic control of inflammation in tissues frequently exposed to pathogens, not simply by suppression of T cell production in total but by increasing the opportunity for T cells that recognize self-antigens to escape selection in the thymus and thus contribute actively to chronic inflammatory processes.",

Active regulation of innate immune response is therefore vital to minimize immune-generated tissue destruction and damage. It has been reported that within the middle ear mucosa, antigen-specific Treg cells can improve suppression of immune-mediated OM by inhibition of IgG and IgM plasma cell precursors while stimulating IgA-forming plasma cells (Ueyama et al., 1988). Thus, mucosal immunization may significantly reduce induction of immune-mediated damage in the middle ear through reduced risk of reduction of IgG-induced mucosal inflammation and increased antigen-specific S-IgA secretion. Further studies to explore the role of Treg cells in the middle ear are required. However, given observations in the adenoid, Treg cell immunity may be important in the control of inflammatory processes in middle ear infection.",

            "text": "The four predominant otopathogens are S. pneumoniae, NTHi, M. catarrhalis, and RSV, and vaccine strategies to prevent OM should initially be targeted toward these microbes. For S. pneumoniae, the vaccine must include the major serotypes responsible for disease. There are a number of pneumococcal vaccines, developed primarily for prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease, currently available (Cripps and Otczyk, 2006, Cripps et al., 2005, Cripps and Kyd, 2003, Schuerman et al., 2009). One of these vaccines, a polysaccharide-conjugated formulation, uses a protein from NTHi (protein D) as the main carrier protein. Conjugate vaccine efficacy against S. pneumoniae-induced AOM for vaccine serotypes is in the order of 55%. A prototype of the conjugate vaccine containing protein D as the polysaccharide carrier demonstrated an efficacy against AOM of 35.3% due to NTHi, as well as a 57.6% efficacy against serotypes included in the vaccine (Prymula et al., 2006). For OM resulting from S. pneumoniae non-vaccine serotypes, little protection has been observed (Schuerman et al., 2009, Prymula et al., 2006). Studies using animal models and the mucosal immunization route have demonstrated that immunization was able to significantly enhance clearance of each bacterium from the middle ear when subsequently challenged with live bacteria (Cripps and Kyd, 2007). Inclusion of multiple serotypes in an experimental LOS-based vaccine against M. catarrhalis elicited humoral and cellular immune protection against most strains within a mouse model (Ren et al., 2011). For humans, the disappointing outcomes of current polysaccharide conjugate vaccines on AOM, despite good systemic antibody responses, may be several: serotype replacement following vaccination by non-vaccine serotypes or other bacterial otopathogens; different causative S. pneumoniae serotypes from those that cause invasive disease; suboptimal antibody responses following immunization to some serotypes; and the lack of induction of mucosal immune responses in the middle ear following systemic immunization (Cripps and Otczyk, 2006). A greater understanding of immune mechanisms in the middle ear will facilitate the development of vaccination strategies for OM, although it is without doubt that a polymicrobial vaccine will be required.",

Ascension of commensal bacteria from the nasopharynx via the eustachian tube to the middle ear initiates innate responses within the middle ear mucosa that, through a complex series of signaling cascades, result in either clearance or failure to clear the pathogen from the middle ear. Secretion of SIgA by the middle ear mucosa may provide improved immunoprotection by prevention of pathogen colonization of the middle ear. Although the majority of childhood middle ear infections resolve uneventfully in most children, very young children are at greater risk of pathogen colonization despite upregulation of innate and acquired immune responses by the middle ear. Mucosal vaccination, targeted to the most common otopathogens, may act via enhanced SIgA response within the middle ear mucosa to prevent development of acute and chronic OM in young children. Finally, the role of regulatory T cells in controlling the middle ear immune response to pathogens requires further investigation. Specifically, the role of regulatory T cells as potential moderators of middle ear inflammatory responses post infection may further reduce the risk of development of chronic or recurrent OM.",

Pattern recognition receptors (PRR) detect conserved molecular signatures of invading microbes and facilitate activation of synthesis and secretion of downstream cytokine cascades. This figure schematically represents the signaling pathways activated by NTHi both at the cell membrane and within the cell cytoplasm of the middle ear mucosal cells. The information portrayed was extracted from published reports of experiments utilizing middle ear cell lines and middle ear epithelium and mucosa from animal models and human biopsy material. Transmembrane TLR receptors 1, 2, and 4\u201310 predominate at the cell surface and their activation results in translocation of NF-\u03baB to the nucleus and upregulation of type II interferons and a range of proinflammatory and antimicrobial molecules. TLR3 utilizes an MYD88-independent pathway via TRIF and IRF3 to upregulate type I interferons. In addition, stimulation of TLR3 and 4 may also activate a delayed response (dotted lines) through TAK1, then the JNK p38MAPK pathway or NF-\u03baB to stimulate type II interferons and proinflammatory molecule production. TGF-\u03b2 activates SMAD 3 and SMAD 4, ultimately upregulating NF-\u03baB; however, the mechanism for this pathway, although assumed similar to that exhibited by respiratory epithelia, has not been confirmed for middle ear mucosa as indicated. PRR within the cell cytoplasm, such as NOD-1 and NOD-2 and TLR9 receptors on the endosomes, can also upregulate NF-\u03baB stimulation of type II interferons and proinflammatory and antimicrobial molecules via MyD88-independent and -dependent pathways, respectively. DAI may activate both NF-\u03baB and NF-\u03baB-independent stimulation of type II and type 1 interferons, respectively. POL3 via IRF7 stimulates the MyD88-independent pathway utilized by TLR3, while AIM2, via caspase 1, stimulates formation of IL1 and IL18 formation within the cytoplasm.",
