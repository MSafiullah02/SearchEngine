This chapter considers the rationale for \u2018no-touch\u2019 automated room disinfection (NTD) systems, which offer the potential to improve the efficacy and reliability of hospital disinfection. An assessment of the level of surface contamination that is a risk for transmission and understanding the limitations of conventional cleaning and disinfection methods is important to appreciate the potential of NTD systems. This chapter provide a detailed overview of the four classes of NTD system that are most commonly used in healthcare settings: aerosolised hydrogen peroxide (aHP), (H2O2) vapour, ultraviolet C radiation (UVC) and pulsed-xenon UV (PX-UV). The differences between these systems in terms of their technological aspects, microbiological efficacy, evidence of clinical impact and practicalities are described, along with a brief overview of other NTD systems and a consideration of their comparative effectiveness and cost. Based on these differences, the scenarios in which various NTD systems may be indicated are discussed in detail. Finally, future trends are also considered.",

            "text": "At one time, contaminated surfaces were thought to contribute negligibly to endemic transmission of pathogens in hospitals (Maki et al., 1982, McGowan, 1981). However, recent data indicate that contaminated surfaces make an important contribution to the endemic transmission of certain nosocomial pathogens (Maki et al., 1982, Otter et al., 2011, Weber et al., 2010). The most convincing evidence comes from studies showing that admission to a room previously occupied by a patient colonised or infected with certain pathogens increases the risk of subsequent occupants acquiring these pathogens by a factor of at least two (Datta et al., 2011, Drees et al., 2008, Huang et al., 2006, Nseir et al., 2011, Otter et al., 2011, Shaughnessy et al., 2011). This association has been demonstrated for Clostridium difficile, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Drees et al., 2008, Huang et al., 2006, Nseir et al., 2011, Otter et al., 2011, Shaughnessy et al., 2011). The epidemiological association is strengthened by the finding that improving terminal room disinfection reduces or eliminates this increased risk (Datta et al., 2011, Passaretti et al., 2013). Thus, current terminal cleaning and disinfection following the discharge of patients with these pathogens is inadequate and needs to be improved. The increasing age and susceptibility of hospitalised patients, combined with the emergence of more virulent and epidemic strains of C. difficile such as 027/NAP1 and potentially untreatable multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria such as pan-drug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, carbapenemase producing organisms and certain viruses (for example the SARS Coronavirus), are further reasons to improve environmental decontamination (Dubberke et al., 2007, Peleg and Hooper, 2010).",

Improvement of these conventional methods requires modification of human behaviour, which is difficult to achieve and sustain. The use of NTD systems provides an adjunctive approach, which removes or reduces reliance on the operator (Byrns and Fuller, 2011, Davies et al., 2011, Falagas et al., 2011, Rutala and Weber, 2011).",

In the 1960s, formaldehyde was replaced by aerosolised chemicals such as quaternary ammonium compounds and phenolics due to concerns over toxicity and provided promising data on effectiveness (Friedman et al., 1968, Munster and Ostrander, 1974, Ostrander and Griffith, 1964). However, concerns over efficacy and safety led to advice from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) since the 1970s that disinfectant fogging should not be performed routinely in patient-care areas (Munster and Ostrander, 1974, Rutala et al., 2008). The increasing recognition of the importance of environmental contamination in transmission has prompted the development of several new NTD systems based on either hydrogen peroxide or ultraviolet radiation. The improved efficacy and safety of these systems compared with the disinfectant aerosolisers of the 1960s and 1970s has prompted a re-evaluation of the CDC recommendation (Rutala and Weber, 2011).",

The fact that subsequent occupants of a room vacated by a previously colonised or infected patient are at increased risk of infection indicates that conventional terminal cleaning and disinfection do not reduce contamination sufficiently to prevent transmission in these cases (Drees et al., 2008, Huang et al., 2006, Nseir et al., 2011, Otter et al., 2011, Shaughnessy et al., 2011).",

(2010) developed a murine model and showed a dose\u2013response relationship between the level of contamination in the cages and the proportion of healthy mice that developed C. difficile infection (CDI). All mice became infected when exposed for one hour to 100 spores/cm2 and 50% became infected when exposed to 5 spores/cm2. The concentration at which none of the mice became infected was less than one spore per cm2. In the healthcare environment, room exposure times are usually measured in days and so the estimates by Lawley et al. are likely to be conservative. Lawley et al. then examined which disinfectants were able to interrupt the transmission of C. difficile and established a relationship between the level of inactivation of C. difficile spores in vitro and the degree to which transmission was interrupted (Fig. 17.2\n). Although data from animal studies should be interpreted with caution, these studies suggest that a low level of contamination can transmit spores to a susceptible host, and that there is a proportional relationship between the level of surface contamination and the degree of transmission.",

For example, the infectious dose for norovirus is 1\u2013100 viral particles (Yezli and Otter, 2011) while stool concentrations can reach more than 1012 particles per gram (Otter et al., 2011) and up to 105 norovirus particles per 30 cm2 have been identified on hospital surfaces (Morter et al., 2011). Therefore, the presence of a pathogen on a surface at any concentration may be a risk for transmission.

For example, a large assessment of conventional cleaning in 36 acute hospitals using fluorescent markers revealed that less than 50% of high-risk objects in hospital rooms were cleaned at patient discharge (Carling et al., 2008). Distribution of the active agent is difficult in the complex and intricate healthcare environment (Carling et al., 2008). Ensuring the correct contact time to attain the microbial reduction achieved in vitro is particularly problematic because the disinfectant will evaporate from the surface (Fraise, 2011). Other problems include the delegation of responsibility for cleaning, which can fall between staff groups such as nurses and domestic housekeepers particularly in the case of complex portable medical equipment (Havill et al., 2011); difficulties in measuring the effectiveness of cleaning and disinfection (Rutala and Weber, 2011) and achieving compliance with protocols/policies from an (often) poorly paid, poorly motivated workforce who may have limited spoken or written local language skills (Dancer, 1999); inadequate training and education of personnel (Dancer, 1999); inadequate time given to do the job properly (Dancer, 1999); insufficient (or non-existent) cleaning prior to disinfection (Humphreys, 2011); incorrect formulation of the disinfectant (Meyer and Cookson, 2010, Weber et al., 2007); and contamination of cleaning solutionsmaterials (Weber et al., 2007, Werry et al., 1988).",

            "text": "Modifying human behaviour is difficult but several different approaches can be taken, including routine microbiological analysis of surface hygiene, the use of fluorescent markers or ATP assays to assess the thoroughness of cleaning, feedback of cleaning performance, and education to enhance knowledge about the importance of the process (Boyce et al., 2009, Carling et al., 2008, Dancer, 2004, Datta et al., 2011, Mulvey et al., 2011, Rutala and Weber, 2011). The development of improved protocols and structured career progression for cleaning staff should be considered in addition to monitoring and feedback. This can improve the frequency of surfaces that are cleaned (Carling et al., 2006, Carling et al., 2008) and reduce the level of environmental contamination (Eckstein et al., 2007, Goodman et al., 2008). There is some evidence that improving the efficacy of conventional cleaning/disinfection can reduce the acquisition of pathogens (Dancer et al., 2009, Datta et al., 2011, Hayden et al., 2006). For example, Hayden et al. (2006) performed a 9-month prospective before and after study of educational improvements of cleaning and hand hygiene: the proportion of surfaces contaminated with VRE was reduced from 24% to 12% and patient acquisition of VRE was reduced from 33 to 17 acquisitions per 1000 patient-days. Few studies have evaluated the sustainability of such systematic improvements. One study showed that cleaning performance measured by the removal of a fluorescent marker increased from a baseline of 52% to 80\u201385% through training and monthly feedback (Fitzgerald et al., 2012). However, compliance soon returned towards baseline (57\u201366%) when the monthly feedback ceased. Similarly, recent evidence indicates that altering the location of fluorescent dye spots reduced the proportion of objects that were cleaned from 90% to approximately 60% (Rutala and Weber, 2011).",

The systems used most commonly in healthcare use a solution containing 5\u20136% hydrogen peroxide and < 50 ppm silver (Fig. 17.3\n) (Chan et al., 2011, Orlando et al., 2008, Otter and Yezli, 2011, Otter et al., 2010b, Shapey et al., 2008). These systems are sometimes known as \u2018dry-mist hydrogen peroxide\u2019, though this term is a poor reflection of their properties (Andersen et al., 2010, Barbut et al., 2009). Aerosolised droplets are introduced into an enclosure via a unidirectional nozzle (Boyce, 2009, Rutala and Weber, 2011). One manufacturer (ASP Glosair) states a particle size of 8\u201310 \u03bcm (Fu et al., 2012, Holmdahl et al., 2011) whereas another (Oxypharm Nocospray) states a smaller particle size of 0.5 \u03bcm (Orlando et al., 2008). The dose typically recommended for hospital rooms is 6 mL per m3, although multiple cycles of this dose have been used in several studies (Andersen et al., 2006, Holmdahl et al., 2011). Following exposure, the aerosol is usually left to decompose naturally, without any active aeration.",

Two systems using H2O2 vapour are available commercially \u2013 Bioquell and Steris. Bioquell systems are usually termed hydrogen peroxide vapour (HPV) and Steris systems vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP). Bioquell HPV includes a generator to produce HPV, a module to measure the concentration of HPV, temperature and relative humidity in the enclosure and an aeration unit to catalyse the breakdown of HPV to oxygen and water vapour after HPV exposure. A control pedestal is situated outside the enclosure to provide remote control. Bioquell HPV is delivered until the air in the enclosure becomes saturated and H2O2 begins to condense on surfaces (Hall et al., 2007, Ray et al., 2010). Steris VHP systems have a generator inside the room with an integral aeration unit and dehumidifier designed to achieve a set humidity level prior to the start of the cycle. The system is controlled remotely from outside the enclosure. Steris VHP systems deliver \u2018non-condensing\u2019 VHP by drying the vapour stream as it is returned to the generator. Bioquell systems do not control the H2O2 air concentration while the Steris systems hold a steady H2O2 air concentration throughout the exposure period.",

Catalase-positive bacteria are considerably less susceptible to the low concentration of H2O2 used by aHP systems than catalase-negative bacteria or metabolically inert spores (Otter and French, 2009, Pottage et al., 2012). The efficacy of aHP systems against catalase-positive bacteria remains to be firmly established, with conflicting published data on the level of inactivation of MRSA and A. baumannii (Fu et al., 2012, Piskin et al., 2011) and tuberculocidal activity (Andersen, 2010; Andersen et al., 2010, Beswick et al., 2011, Grare et al., 2008). aHP systems have been shown to reduce contamination of C. difficile and MRSA on hospital surfaces (Bartels et al., 2008, Barbut et al., 2009, Chan et al., 2011, Orlando et al., 2008, Shapey et al., 2008), but have not been shown to eliminate pathogens in clinical practice. For example, one or more positive C. difficile cultures were collected from 20% of 15 (Barbut et al., 2009) and 50% of 10 (Shapey et al., 2008) rooms studied after an aHP process.",

VHP has been used for tackling environmental reservoirs during outbreaks of A. baumannii in two reports (Chmielarczyk et al., 2012, Ray et al., 2010). The clinical impact of VHP aside from outbreak settings is not reported. On the other hand, three studies have assessed the impact of HPV in the setting of endemic infections. A prospective cohort study by Passaretti et al. demonstrated that patients admitted to rooms vacated by patients with multidrug resistant organisms (MDROs) and disinfected using HPV were 64% less likely to acquire MDROs than patients admitted to such rooms disinfected using standard methods (Passaretti et al., 2013).

(2008) performed a before and after study showing that HPV decontamination of rooms vacated by patients with C. difficile infection (CDI) significantly reduced the incidence of CDI both on targeted wards and hospital-wide when the analysis was restricted to the months when the epidemic strain was known to be present. Manian et al. (2011) performed a before and after study showing that HPV decontamination of rooms vacated by patients with CDI (or quadruple bleach disinfection where HPV was not available) significantly reduced the hospital-wide incidence of CDI by 37%. Whilst it was not possible to differentiate the impact of introducing HPV and quadruple bleach disinfection, a previous study by the same group showed that quadruple bleach disinfection was necessary to eliminate A. baumannii and MRSA from surfaces, and that HPV was microbiologically superior to quadruple bleach disinfection. Thus, since HPV has time and efficiency savings compared with quadruple bleach disinfection, it was cost effective to use HPV in this setting (Manian et al., 2013).",

            "text": "aHP is straightforward to use and relatively inexpensive compared with H2O2 vapour and UVC systems. The capacity of single units to decontaminate areas larger than single rooms is limited so multiple generators may be necessary (Holmdahl et al., 2011). Doors and air vents should be sealed and hand-held health and safety monitors are required to ensure that no leakage occurs during cycles and to verify that the concentration of hydrogen peroxide inside the enclosure is below health and safety exposure limits (Fu et al., 2012). Reported cycle times are 3\u20134 hours for multiple cycles (Bartels et al., 2008, Holmdahl et al., 2011) and 2 hours for single cycles (Shapey et al., 2008). However, cycle times for single rooms may be considerably longer when hand-held sensors are used to ensure the hydrogen peroxide concentrations are below health and safety limits prior to room re-entry (Fu et al., 2012). Several studies suggest that homogeneous distribution of the active agent is not achieved (Fu et al., 2012, Holmdahl et al., 2011, Shapey et al., 2008), perhaps because aHP is introduced via a unidirectional nozzle and the particles are affected by gravity. Sub-lethal exposure to hydrogen peroxide or silver could result in the development of tolerance or resistance (Chopra, 2007, McDonnell and Russell, 1999, Meyer and Cookson, 2010). The potential for transferable resistance to silver is greater than for hydrogen peroxide due to plasmid-mediated silver resistance genes (Chopra, 2007, McDonnell and Russell, 1999). Data are required confirming the compatibility of aHP systems with common hospital materials, including sensitive electronics. Finally, several studies have noted equipment reliability problems (Beswick et al., 2011, Fu et al., 2012, Shapey et al., 2008), which was a feature of older foggers (Munster and Ostrander, 1974).",

However, H2O2 vapour systems are less straightforward than UV and aHP systems because they require two units (a generator and aeration unit) for a single room. Door and air vents need to be sealed. As with aHP, hand-held health and safety monitors are required to ensure that no leakage occurs during cycles and that the concentration of H2O2 inside the enclosure is below health and safety exposure limits (1 ppm) before re-entry. Thus, staff training requirements for using H2O2 systems are higher than for UV systems. The potential for selection of less susceptible strains is lower than for aHP or UV systems because the high-concentration H2O2 vapour systems ensures that few microorganisms undergo sub-lethal exposure. Reported cycle times are currently 1.5\u20132.5 hours for a single room for HPV (Department of Health, 2009, Otter and Yezli, 2010) and 8 hours for VHP (Ray et al., 2010). The compatibility of HPV with hospital materials, including sensitive electronics, is well established (EPA, 2010a). A recent study reported incompatibility of HPV with one brand of paint that was rectified by replacing the paint with a different brand (Passaretti et al., 2013).",

            "text": "UVC is easy to use, does not require sealing of door or air vents and has a relatively short cycle time. Many high-touch sites may be out of line of sight; some manufacturers recommended multiple cycles in different parts of the room to overcome this problem but this places reliance on the operator to choose appropriate equipment locations, has implications for cycle times and requires more hands-on operator time. A recent study indicates that a UVC spore cycle in rooms ranging from 46\u201386 m3 took a median of 84 min (range 72\u2013146 min) for a two-stage procedure (where the UVC unit is positioned at two locations during the cycle) and a median of 68 min (range 34\u2013100 min) for a one-stage procedure (Boyce et al., 2011). Since some UVC systems rely on measurement of reflected dose to determine the cycle, the presence of surfaces that do not reflect UVC, or reflect it inefficiently (such as glass), variations in temperature and humidity and the age of the bulbs will affect the reflected dose and may increase the cycle times (Memarzadeh et al., 2010, Reeda, 2010). The intensity of the UV light dissipates with the square of the distance from the source, which limits the capacity of single UVC devices to disinfect areas larger than single patient rooms (Harrington and Valigosky, 2007). The long-term impact of UVC on hospital materials has not been described (Tyan et al., 2002). UVC is relatively expensive compared with other NTD systems (ECRI, 2011). Finally, UV radiation is a known mutagen (Anderson, 1995); since UVC systems do not inactivate all microbes in the room, a proportion of those that have received a sublethal dose may undergo mutation.",

Two studies of different ozone generators were performed in test chambers of 30\u201335 m3. which used a concentration of ozone gas peaking at 20\u201325 ppm. These studies indicated a 3\u20134 log reduction on vegetative bacteria, a < 3-log reduction on mycobacteria and a dose-dependent < 3-log reduction on bacterial endospores in one study (Moat et al., 2009) but a > 4-log spore reduction in the other (Sharma and Hudson, 2008). Both evaluations tested the systems at high humidity, one at 80\u201390% (Moat et al., 2009) and one at > 95% (Sharma and Hudson, 2008). Another system used a high concentration of gaseous ozone (80 ppm) and up to 3% aHP combined with high humidity (80%) to achieve a > 6-log reduction of various hospital pathogens in vitro (Zoutman et al., 2011). Substantially lower reductions were achieved at lower relative humidity (Zoutman et al., 2011). The requirement for high humidity is a major practical limitation for ozone-based systems (Li and Wang, 2003). Furthermore, ozone is toxic to humans, with a safe exposure level in the UK and USA of < 0.1 ppm (compared with 1 ppm for H2O2), so effective containment of the gas, monitoring for leakage and measurements to assure that the room is safe to enter are necessary for these systems in the healthcare setting (OSHA, 2005). Data on the compatibility of this process with hospital materials are needed, given ozone\u2019s known corrosive properties (Davies et al., 2011).",

BIs can be produced in-house or, more reliably, can be purchased commercially (typically containing G. stearothermophilus bacterial endospores). Most NTD systems produce a more significant reduction of bacterial contamination than conventional disinfection (Barbut et al., 2009, Boyce et al., 2011, French et al., 2004, Manian et al., 2011, Nerandzic et al., 2010, Shapey et al., 2008). However, comparison of the relative effectiveness of different NTD systems is difficult because of variations in sample sites (especially orientation and proximity to the NTD device), patient infection or colonisation status, the organism, the microbiological testing methods and the type of pre-cleaning. Thus, the best way to compare different systems is through controlled head-to-head studies (Boyce, 2009), ideally using outcomes related to reduced transmission in clinical settings. However, there have been few studies comparing these outcomes, so it is not possible to evaluate the relative clinical impact of NTD systems using current data. Thus, the available head-to-head studies are currently the most useful way to compare NTD systems.",

Testing was performed in a 50 m3 room with a 13 m3 anteroom, selected to represent a single occupancy room with a bathroom. Safety was evaluated using a hand-held hydrogen peroxide sensor. The workplace exposure limits (WEL) for H2O2 are 1 ppm as an 8-hour time weighted average, or 2 ppm for 15 minutes as a short-term exposure limit (STEL) (Health and Safety Executive, 2005). The HPV manufacturer mandates re-entering the room only after the measurable concentration of H2O2 is < 1 ppm; the aHP manufacturer recommended room re-entry 2 hours after the start of the cycle. Thus, in this study the mean concentration of H2O2 in the room was measured 2 hours after the cycle started for both systems. The mean H2O2 concentration in the room 2 hours after the cycle started was 2.8 \u00b1 0.8 ppm for aHP, with a maximum reading of 4.5 ppm and no readings < 2 ppm, and 1.3 \u00b1 0.4 ppm for HPV, with no readings > 2 ppm. Thus, for both systems room re-entry must be controlled by measurements of H2O2 concentrations rather than assuming safe levels at the end of the process. A \u2018controlled leakage\u2019 experiment was performed in the St George\u2019s study to determine whether H2O2 leaked from an unsealed room door. This was only done for the aHP system because the user manuals recommend door and air vent sealing with adhesive tape for the HPV system but not for the aHP. More than 20 ppm H2O2 was detected outside an unsealed door, indicating that doors must be sealed during cycles. These findings also imply that air vents should be sealed during room disinfection with H2O2 systems.",

In addition, in-house prepared test discs dried in 3% or 10% bovine serum albumin (BSA) to simulate dirty conditions were tested in two further room locations. There are no standard testing methods for NTD systems, so the in-house test discs were used to measure log reductions of the common nosocomial pathogens and 6-log and 4-log G. stearothermophilus BIs were used two provide two levels of challenge. HPV inactivated 91% (40/44) of the 6-log and 95% (42/44) of the 4-log G. stearothermophilus BIs. HPV generally achieved a 6-log reduction of the MRSA, A. baumannii and C. difficile BIs regardless of room location. aHP inactivated 13.6% (6/44) of the 6-log BIs, and 36.4% of the 4-log BIs. aHP achieved a < 4-log reduction at 2/11 room locations for MRSA, 7/11 for A. baumannii and 2/11 for C. difficile spores. The aHP system had reduced efficacy against the catalase-positive A. baumannii with a < 2-log reductions at 6/11 of room locations. HPV achieved a > 5-log reduction at 11/12 locations with MRSA, A. baumannii or C. difficile dried in 3% or 10% BSA compared with 3/12 locations for aHP. This suggests that HPV is more able to penetrate increasing levels of soil, which may be important with sub-optimal pre-cleaning. The log reduction of the in-house prepared test discs varied considerably by room location for aHP but not for HPV, indicating a more uneven distribution of the active agent for aHP.",

Ninety percent of BIs yielded bacterial growth after the first aHP cycle compared with 21% after both cycles two and three, suggesting poor repeatability.

The key factors are whether the area to be disinfected is a single room or a multi-occupancy area, whether the clinical setting is high risk for infection acquisition (e.g. an ICU) or low risk (e.g. a general ward), and the target organism (Barbut et al., 2009, Boyce et al., 2008, Otter et al., 2010c, Passaretti et al., 2013, Shapey et al., 2008). The risk associated with individual pathogens in the context of disinfection will depend on a number of factors, including the importance of environmental contamination in transmission, clinical implications, local epidemiology and financial outcomes. For example, a multidrug-resistant Gram-negative rod or C. difficile causing an outbreak would be considered a \u2018high-risk\u2019 pathogen, whereas VRE colonisation would be considered lower risk. Further issues that may need to be considered are the clinical, financial and reputational effects of environmental infections, especially during on-going outbreaks requiring ward closures. Closures may have particular adverse impacts when they involve specialist regional units such as those for neonatal, paediatric or adult intensive care.",

            "text": "The disinfection of multi-occupancy bays using NTD systems is constrained by the need to accommodate patients elsewhere during the disinfection process (Otter et al., 2009b). However, this may be necessary and justified to bring a serious outbreak of high-risk pathogens in high-risk patients under control. It may be practical to use UV systems for the disinfection of single rooms used by patients with low-risk pathogens in low-risk settings (Nerandzic et al., 2010, Rutala et al., 2010) but practical constraints limit the use of hydrogen peroxide NTD systems in this situation. Conversely, H2O2 vapour systems would be appropriate for dealing with high-risk pathogens in high-risk units because of their high levels of efficacy, homogeneous distribution and disinfection assurance (Boyce et al., 2008, Manian et al., 2011, Otter et al., 2010a). Examples include on-going outbreaks in intensive care units with NAP1/027C. difficile or a multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogen. UV and hydrogen peroxide systems may be suitable for disinfection of single rooms in low-risk settings with high-risk pathogens or in high-risk settings with low-risk pathogens (Bartels et al., 2008, Boyce et al., 2008, French et al., 2004, Nerandzic et al., 2010, Shapey et al., 2008). Enhanced conventional disinfection methods should also be employed in these scenarios (Dancer et al., 2009, Datta et al., 2011, Hayden et al., 2006, Mahamat et al., 2007, Mayfield et al., 2000, Wilcox et al., 2003), with the possible exception of high-risk pathogens occurring in high-risk settings where even enhanced conventional disinfection has been shown to leave residual contamination (Datta et al., 2011, Manian et al., 2011, Morter et al., 2011, Wilcox et al., 2003).",

Sweeney and Dancer, 2009). The impact of organic matter has been demonstrated by several in vitro studies. For example, Otter et al. evaluated the efficacy of HPV for the inactivation of MRSA dried on stainless steel discs in suspending media containing 0.3%, 3% and 10% BSA (Otter et al., 2012). The effectiveness of HPV was reduced as the concentration of BSA increased. There is evidence that some NTD systems are more susceptible to organic soiling than others. For example, the study by Fu et al. showed that aHP is more susceptible to simulated soiling by BSA than HPV (Fu et al., 2012).",

            "text": "NTD systems could be validated by routine microbiological sampling using conventional standards (Dancer, 2004), but this is time consuming, costly and requires microbiological expertise. Another option is the use of BIs, which provide a semi-quantitative measure of microbiological efficacy and repeatability (Boyce et al., 2008, Holmdahl et al., 2011). The question remains as to whether 6-log BIs are an appropriate test for validating NTD systems, given that the concentration of contamination on hospital surfaces is usually in the 2-log range (Holmdahl et al., 2011, Otter and Yezli, 2012, Walder and Holmdahl, 2012). Walder and Holmdahl (2012) argue that soiling and biofilms (Smith and Hunter, 2008, Vickery et al., 2012), occasional higher levels of contamination (Morter et al., 2011), the occurrence of pathogens with reduced susceptibility to certain agents (Pottage et al., 2012) and the potential for incomplete distribution (Fu et al., 2012, Havill et al., 2012, Holmdahl et al., 2011) mean that 6-log BIs are an appropriate target for NTD systems. Recent evidence published by Pottage et al. (2012) and others (Beswick et al., 2011, Fu et al., 2012, Otter and French, 2009) indicating that catalase-positive bacteria are less susceptible to hydrogen peroxide-based NTD systems than bacterial endospores provides a further reason to use stringent challenges for these systems (Otter and Yezli, 2012).",

Also, the use of UV reflective paint could reduce the impact of line-of-sight issues for UV systems (Rutala, 2012). In addition, there seems to be a natural synergy between the use of NTD systems and antimicrobial surfaces or air disinfection systems, which can help to reduce the extent of surface contamination during the stay of a patient (Sexton et al., 2006, Weber and Rutala, 2012).
