The standard image diagnosis tests for pneumonia are chest X-ray (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) scan. CXR are useful in because it is cheaper, faster and more widespread than CT. This study aims to identify pneumonia caused by COVID-19 from other types and also healthy lungs using only CXR images. In order to achieve the objectives, we have proposed a classification schema considering the multi-class and hierarchical perspectives, since pneumonia can be structured as a hierarchy. Given the natural data imbalance in this domain, we also proposed the use of resampling algorithms in order to re-balance the classes distribution. Our classification schema extract features using some well-known texture descriptors and also using a pre-trained CNN model. We also explored early and late fusion techniques in order to leverage the strength of multiple texture descriptors and base classifiers at once. To evaluate the approach, we composed a database, named RYDLS-20, containing CXR images of pneumonia caused by different pathogens as well as CXR images of healthy lungs. The classes distribution follows a real-world scenario in which some pathogens are more common than others. The proposed approach achieved a macro-avg F1-Score of 0.65 using a multi-class approach and a F1-Score of 0.89 for the COVID-19 identification in the hierarchical classification scenario. As far as we know, we achieved the best nominal rate obtained for COVID-19 identification in an unbalanced environment with more than three classes. We must also highlight the novel proposed hierarchical classification approach for this task, which considers the types of pneumonia caused by the different pathogens and lead us to the best COVID-19 recognition rate obtained here.",

Specifically, we considered pneumonia caused by viruses (COVID-19, SARS, MERS and Varicella), bacteria (Streptococcus) and fungi (Pneumocystis). Moreover, because of the recent pandemic which is ravaging the world, the main focus of this work is the COVID-19 pneumonia, and our principal goal is to reach the best possible identification rate for it among other types of pneumonia and healthy lungs. To support that, we have taken into account two perspectives in the results' evaluation: first, we considered all classes mentioned above and summarized the results using a macro-avg F1-Score; second, we considered only the COVID-19 class and summarized the results using F1-Score.",

Figure 1 shows how the types of pneumonia caused by micro-organisms can be hierarchically organized. We may observe that there is a total of fourteen labels, in which seven are leaf nodes, i.e., which are the actual type of pneumonia. There are pneumonia caused by micro-organisms Acelullar/Virus and Cellular. By its turn, the Acelullar/Virus pneumonia can be subdivided into Coronavirus and Varicella, and the Celullar into Bacteria/Streptococcus and Fungus/Pneumocystis. Furthermore, the Coronavirus can be further subcategorized into COVID-19, SARS and MERS. This hierarchy is based on the structure developed in 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) [17] . According to [10] , there are different ways to tackle a hierarchical classification problem regarding the categorization of the classification process. In the Local Classifiers (LC) approach, the hierarchy is partially taken into account by using a local information perspective, creating binary/multi-class classifiers to deal with the problem in a local way. Moreover, in the Global Classifiers (GC) approach, a single classification model is built from the training data, taking into account the class hierarchy as a whole during the classification process. As we want the classifier to aim into the whole classes hierarchy in order to find important information between the pneumonia labels, in this paper we have used a GC approach to deal with the hierarchical classification problem.",

The works will be described predominantly in chronological order, and we try to highlight the main facts related to each of them, such as: the feature extraction step, whether it is performed using handcrafted features or automated feature Oversampling [26] SMOTE-B1/B2 Creates synthetic samples considering the borderline between the classes. Oversampling [27] AllKNN Removes samples in which a kNN algorithm misclassifies them. Undersampling [28] ENN/RENN Removes samples in which its label differs from the most of its nearest neighbors. Undersampling [28] TomekLinks Removes samples which are nearest neighbors but has different labels. Undersampling [28] SMOTE+TL Apply SMOTE and TomekLink algorithms. Hybrid [29] (a) Original. The first work we are going to describe was presented by Nanni et al. [30] in 2010. In that work, the authors compared a series of handcrafted texture descriptors derived from the Local Binary Pattern (LBP), considering their use specifically in medical applications. The variants of LBP evaluated were Local Ternary Pattern (LTP), Eliptical Binary Pattern (EBP), and Elongated Quinary Pattern (EQP). These descriptors were evaluated on three different medical applications: i) pain expression detection, starting from facial images of the COPE database [31] , taken from 26 neonates categorized into five different classes (i.e. rest, cry, air stimulus, friction, and pain); ii) Cell phenotype image classification using the 2D-Hela dataset [32] , a dataset composed of 862 single-cell images distributed into ten different classes (i.e. Actin Filaments, Endsome, Endoplasmic Reticulum, Golgi Giantin, Golgi GPP, Lysosome, Microtubules, Mitochondria, Nucleolus, and Nucleus); and iii) Pap smear (Papanikolaou test) aiming to diagnose cervical cancer. They used a dataset composed of 917 images collected at the Herlev University Hospital [33] using digital camera and microscope. The images were labeled according to seven different classes, being three of them related to normal states, and four of them related to abnormal states. After a comprehensive set of experiments using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, the authors verified that the EQP descriptor, or ensembles created using variations of EQP performed better for all the addressed tasks. For this reason, we decided to investigate the performance of EQP in the experiments accomplished in this work.",

The great difference from EQP to LBP and LTP descriptors is that the EQP uses a quinary pattern, not binary or ternary encoding, like LBP and LTP respectively. From a given grayscale image, let us denote x as the central pixel using a given topology, and u as the gray value of the neighboring pixels. In the EQP descriptor, we can assume five different values, instead of two or three, as proposed in the LBP and LTP respectively. Thus, in quinary encoding the difference d is encoded using five values according to two thresholds \u03c4 1 and \u03c4 2 , as described in Equation 2 .",

Basically, the histogram which corresponds to the LETRIST descriptor is based on the across feature and scale space of the image. The authors describe three main steps for generating the representation histogram. In the first step, from multiple input image scales and using Directional Gaussian Derivative Filters, extremum responses are computed. These extremum responses are used to feed linear and non-linear operators to quantitatively construct a set of transform features. This characterizes structures of local textures and their correlations with the input image. In the second step, the quantization is performed using various levels or binary threshold schemas. This step aims at greater robustness in terms of changes in lighting and rotation. Finally, in the third step, a joint cross-scale coding schema is carried out. In this way, it is possible to add discrete texture codes in a compact histogram representation. The authors describe LETRIST as a robust descriptor for different texture classification tasks [51] . We can also point out that it is robust to Gaussian noise, changes in scale, rotation and lighting. In this way, LETRIST becomes a very interesting texture descriptor.",

That is, from a small set of samples of natural images, the descriptor learns a fixed set of filters using Independent Component Analysis (ICA). For the generation of BSIF descriptors, the value of each pixel from an input image M \u00d7 N is transformed into a binary string. In this work, the feature vectors generated using BSIF have 56 dimensions. An interesting study evaluating the robustness of 27 descriptors in palmprint recognition [53] describes that the BSIF descriptor was among the Top-3 best descriptors evaluated.",

These types of local classes are the following: flat, slope, dark rotational, light rotational, dark line on light, light line on dark or saddle-like. To categorize each part of the image, six Derivative-of-Gaussian filters are used, which is determined by the \u03b1 parameter. The parameter \u03b5 classifies the location probability as flat. The feature vector generated through the oBIFs descriptor has 23 dimensions. The orientations were quantified at four levels (n = 4). Newell and Griffin [57, 56] propose a change in the oBIFs descriptor aiming to improve its performance. In this sense, the rationale is that from two different oBIFs descriptors (using different parameters \u03c3 and \u03b5), it is possible to produce oBIFs column features with (5n + 2) 2 dimensions. Thus, the number of dimensions was increased from 23 to 484.",

In order to confirm the importance of this preprocessing step, we must cite the work of Maguolo and Nanni (2020) [63] , in which the authors have made a critical evaluation regarding the combination of different databases for the COVID-19 automatic detection from CXR. In their work, they have cut off the lungs from the x-ray images and have experimentally proved that a classifier can identify from which database the images came from. Thus, the authors highlight that joining different databases may add bias to the classification results, since the classifiers may be recognizing patterns from the origin database and not from the lung injuries. However, as we have manually cut the images edges in RYDLS-20, we have minimized the issue pointed by Maguolo and Nanni (2020) in our experiments. Table 5 presents RYDLS-20 samples distribution for the multi-class scenario. Though the table, it is possible to observe the major imbalanceness of the dataset between the pneumonia labels. In most cases, we have seven-nine samples in the training set and only three samples in the test dataset, which makes the learning process much more difficult than in a balanced context. Table 6 shows RYDLS-20 samples distribution for the hierarchical classification scenario. This scenario seems less imbalanced because of the internal nodes. For example, all viral pneumonia instances are also categorized as \"Acelluar\", so we have a total of 121 samples labeled with \"Pneumonia/Acellular/Viral\". This less imbalanced context for the hierarchical scenario is partially true, since the hierarchical classifier does use this criteria into account during the learning process. It is important to reinforce the statement that RYDLS-20 labels distribution reflect a real world scenario in which healthy cases are much more frequent (majority class), followed by viral pneumonia (mainly caused by COVID-19), bacterial and fungi pneumonia being the least frequent, in this order.",

As shown in this section, we are dealing with a highly imbalanced database, in which half of the labels has between 10-12 samples. Thus, if we use a 10-fold or 5-fold cross-validation (the most recommended values by the research community), most labels will have only one or two examples into each fold. This division would have a high impact in the testing phase, which may lead to misleading results regarding the evaluation measures. Therefore, the use of a cross-validation technique is conditioned to a bigger database, which is a future work target.",

However, it is important to mention that, as well as the database and scripts, a complete version of the results is freely available for further analysis 8 . Moreover, in order to summarize the results into a unique focal point, in subsection 6.3 we also present plots summarizing the best of all results for each classification scenario (Multi-class and Hierarchical). Table 9 shows the best F1-Score results for the COVID-19 identification considering the multi-class scenario. The individual predictions have achieved the same top result as of late fusion method (\u22480.83). Moreover, the MLP classifier is present in the best results for all the prediction schemas, as well as LPQ feature, which is also present in all prediction schemas. Table 10 shows the macro-avg F1-Score for the prediction schemas in the multi-class scenario. The best result was achieved both with individual and late fusion schemas (\u22480.65). Here, the MLP classifier also achieved a good performance, which is present in all schemas with exception of late fusion with top classifiers. However, there is no clear predominance in relation to the best features among these schemas. Figure 7 presents a chart of the individual F1-Score results per label for the best case scenario in the multi-class context, which was achieved using the MLP classifier over LBP features after a resampling using the RENN algorithm. The \"SARS\" label and the \"Normal\" label obtained excellent performance with F1-Score 1.0 and 0.98 respectively. Moreover, Figure 8 presents the confusion matrix for the same best case scenario in the multi-class classification context presented in Figure 7 (MLP classifier with LBP feature using RENN resampling method). Table 11 shows the best F1-Score results for the COVID-19 identification considering the hierarchical scenario. The best F1-Score result for COVID-19 (\u22480.89) was achieved in this context. This result was reached using the early fusion prediction schema with the features BSIF, EQP and LPQ resampled by either SMOTE or TL algorithms. Furthermore, the SMOTE resampling algorithm and BSIF features are present in all these classification schemas. Table 12 presents the macro-avg F1-Score results in the hierarchical scenario. As well as for the COVID-19 identification, the best macro-avg F1-Score result was achieved in the early fusion prediction schema. Furthermore, SMOTE resampling technique also appears in all classification schemas. Figure 7 presents a chart of the individual F1-Score results per label for the best case scenario in the hierarchical classification schemas, which was achieved in the early fusion schema with LBP, INCEPTION-V3 and LETRIST features after resampling with the SMOTE-B1 algorithm. It is important to observe that, as we are dealing with a hierarchical classification problem, the predictions are made for each label in the hierarchy, thus we have a total of fourteen hierarchically organized labels. We may also observe that the classifier achieved very different performances for each type of pneumonia. While for COVID-19, MERS and Streptococcus, it has achieved a F1-Score close to 0.7, for Varicella and Pneumocystis the F1-Score was zero. Figure 10 shows the confusion matrix for the same best case scenario in the hierarchical classification context presented in Figure 9 (Early Fusion of LBP, INCEPTION and LETRIST using SMOTE-B1 resampling method). It is worth mentioning that as we are dealing with the problem in a hierarchical classification design, the construction of the Confusion Matrix can follow different approaches when compared with the ones built in the multi-class classification scenarios. In order to build the Confusion Matrix presented in Figure 10 , we have followed a method used by Buchanan et al. (2019) [68] , in which we group every label of the hierarchy into the same matrix, i.e., all the internal and leaf label nodes. hierarchical classification outperformed the multi-class classification in the individual and early fusion schemas. In addition, the best of all COVID-19 identification result was achieved by the hierarchical classification learner. Figure 11 : Best F1-Score results on multi-class and hierarchical scenarios for COVID-19 Identification. Figure 12 presents a summary of the best macro-avg F1-Score results. We may note that in two (i.e. individual and late fusion) out of the three schemas, the best result was achieved by far in the multi-class classification scenario. Moreover, the best of all macro-avg F1-Score (\u22480.65) was performed by the multi-class learners in the individual and late fusion schemas.

As we have four different measures contexts, i.e., the macro-avg of the results and F1-Score for the COVID-19 in the multi-class and hierarchical scenarios, we have performed this protocol four times, one in each classification context and measure. The test results in relation to the ranking of the features for the COVID-19 Identification and the macro-avg F1-Score are shown in Table 13 . It is worth mentioning that, since this test is composed of rankings, which ranges from the first to the last, the lower the ranking score is, the better is the performance.",

Thus, in Table 14 we present the average ranking per classifier for the COVID-19 identification and the macro-avg F1-Score, both for the multi-class scenario. It can be noted that, regardless the classification context, MLP was by far the best ranked classifier with the lower average overall ranking (1.17) . This MLP dominance can be explained by the fact that it can learn intrinsic characteristics of the problem when given the correct amount of features, which should be happening in our application domain. For this answer, we have used again the same statistical protocol used in the first two questions. However, in this case, ranking the resampling methods. Table 15 presents the results for this test in all the classification contexts. We may observe that, in the multi-class scenario, ENN resampling method was the most effective in improving the COVID-19 identification (with an average ranking of 1.67), while for the macro-avg F1-Score, the most effective resampling methods were AllKNN and RENN, average rankings of 2.33. In the hierarchical context, the resampling technique which, in average, improved the COVID-19 identification the most was SMOTE, with an average ranking of 2.67. Moreover, for the macro-avg F1-Score, SMOTE and SMOTE Borderline-1 resampling methods were the most effective ones, with average rankings of 1.67. Another interesting point to observe in the test results shown in Table 15 is that in an overall average ranking vision, considering all classification scenarios, Tomek Link (TL) technique was the most effective (ranking of 3.83). This result can be explained by the fact that TL is an undersampling method aimed in the removal of pair of instances that can cause confusion in the learner, since they are labaled with different classes but have similar attribute values. Given the domain of application being investigated in this work, this is the exact case that can cause drawbacks in the classification results, since some CXR images are very alike but contains different types of pneumonia.",

The negative point in the hierarchical classification is related to the Varicella and Pneumocystis labels, which had zero F1-Scores in the best macro-avg scenario.

At a first glance, we may say that of course this difference occurs because of the very different classifiers being applied in each scenario. Nevertheless, we may go beyond in this analysis. Even though the distinction between viral and bacterial pneumonia is not relevant enough for the clinical workflows, the hierarchical representation of the problem, proposed here, has shown to be a feasible way to improve the performance on COVID-19 identification. As we have a hierarchical classifier (Clus-HMC) being applied to the problem, it was able to learn relevant information from the hierarchy in order to distinguish some types of pneumonia and maximize exactly the label of greatest interest: COVID-19.",

However, in the following we present other examples that can bring some thoughts into the light of this issue.

However, in practice, due to variate factors such as the patient lung characteristics, type of x-ray scan machine, and even due to the protocol followed by the professional radiologist which operates the scan machine, there might be visual variations between the x-rays captured in this different circumstances that still belongs to the same class.

However, when we are dealing with images taken from patients stricken of pneumonia caused by different types of pathogens and we are trying to predict a specific type of pneumonia (in this case, COVID-19), the problem turns into an even more challenging task.",

In addition, there is a natural imbalance between the number of people stricken of pneumonia caused by different pathogens and, furthermore, it is each time harder to estimate the precise imbalance between these numbers, due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Considering a realistic scenario, in this paper we have proposed a classification schema, aiming to classify pneumonia disease caused by different pathogens in CXR images, and also to identify COVID-19 among them. In the proposed schema we use resampling techniques in order to deal with the intrinsic imbalanceness issue of the problem. Moreover, the proposed schema is composed of eight different feature sets, which are extracted from the images and tested as individual and combined in an early fusion design. Besides, the prediction outputs are also tested individually and in a late fusion design. The proposed schema also foresee the use of flat (multi-class) and hierarchical classifiers. In order to apply hierarchical classification into this application domain, we have considered a tree taxonomy in which the pneumonia are hierarchically organized.",

The dataset is highly imbalanced, with 1,000 images being from people unaffected by pneumonia, 90 of people affected by COVID-19 and the rest almost equally divided among the other pathogens.
