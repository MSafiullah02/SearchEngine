In all, 150 healthy men and women (aged 18-51 years) were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: intranasal interferon (IFN)-a2b ( U every 12 h \u03eb 3) plus oral chlorpheniramine (12 mg extended release) 6 6 \u03eb 10 and ibuprofen (400 mg) every 12 h for 4.5 days ( subjects); intranasal placebo plus oral n p 59 chlorpheniramine and ibuprofen ( subjects); or intranasal and oral placebos ( n p 61 n p 30 subjects). Treatment was started 24 h after intranasal viral challenge. During the 4.5 days of treatment with IFN-a2b, chlorpheniramine, and ibuprofen, the daily mean total symptom score was reduced by 33%-73%, compared with placebo. Treatment reduced the severity of rhinorrhea, sneezing, nasal obstruction, sore throat, cough, and headache and reduced nasal mucus production, nasal tissue use, and virus concentrations in nasal secretions. IFN-a2b added to the effectiveness of chlorpheniramine and ibuprofen and was well tolerated.",

            "text": "Effective treatment for the common cold has been an elusive goal. The often-expressed idea of finding a \"cure\" for the common cold implies the hope of discovering a single molecule for the purpose. Because of this belief, people have been ready to embrace simplistic approaches to cold treatment, such as vitamin C and zinc. However, scientific evidence suggests that the pathogenesis of colds is complex and that cold symptoms result from the action of multiple inflammatory pathways [1] . Commercial cold treatments based on the single-molecule approach, such as decongestants, first-generation antihistamines, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), do not block all these pathways and so are effective against some cold symptoms but not others [2] . Antivirals are effective in reducing viral replication and in preventing illness, when given before symptom onset, but have less than an optimal therapeutic effect in reducing symptoms if initiated after illness is present [3] [4] [5] . This may be due to their failure to suppress inflammatory events that are activated early in the infection. For a nonantiviral single-molecule cold treatment to work effectively, it must block a putative host response that triggers the humoral, cellular, and neurologic pathways involved in the pathogenesis of cold symptoms [1]. It is not clear that a single triggering event actually exists.",

            "text": "An alternative to the single-molecule approach to treating colds is to use a combination therapy that includes an antiviral and \u04431 anti-inflammatory components that block both viral replication and inflammatory events. The results of an earlier small clinical trial using this type of combination treatment were promising [6] . The current study was conducted to further evaluate the combination treatment approach. Intranasal interferon (IFN)-a2b was used as the antiviral agent because of its activity against rhinovirus, coronavirus, and respiratory syncytial virus and its prolonged duration of action, which allows infrequent dosing [4, [7] [8] [9] . It was expected that the IFN-a2b would reduce viral replication, as reflected by virus concentrations in nasal secretions, as was observed in earlier studies [4, 6] . There were 2 anti-inflammatory components. A first-generation antihistamine, chlorpheniramine, was used because of the effectiveness of this class of compounds in treating the sneezing and rhinorrhea of colds [10] [11] [12] [13] . It is possible that chlorpheniramine may also have some antitussive activity, because a closely related compound, brompheniramine, has therapeutic activity for cough [13] . An NSAID, ibuprofen, was used because of its effectiveness in treating headache, malaise, and myalgia [14] and because NSAIDs are also effective in treating sore throat [15] and cough [16] [17] [18] . It was anticipated that this combination of antiviral and antiinflammatory ingredients, through additive or synergistic action, would treat the full range of cold symptoms, which single-ingredient cold treatments do not [2] .",

The study was conducted twice (9 October 1998 and 13 January 1999), using the same protocol, as a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-masked clinical trial. Eighty subjects were enrolled in the first trial and 70 in the second. Viral challenge was done between 6:30 and 8 A.M. (day 0). Treatment was started 24 h later (day 1), by which time the subjects had developed symptoms. Subjects were placed in individual motel rooms at 5 P.M. on day 0 and had contact only with study personnel until the morning of day 5.",

The combined treatment with IFN-a, chlorpheniramine, and ibuprofen tested in this study reduced individual and total symptoms scores and reduced nasal mucus production and virus concentration in nasal secretions. In subjects who were symptomatic when treatment was started, the full treatment resulted in a 33%-73% reduction in the daily mean total symptom severity score during the 4.5 days of treatment. The combination treatment was also well tolerated. Although nasal irritation occurs when intranasal IFN application is extended past several days [24] , the abbreviated dosage schedule used in this study and in an earlier study [6] did not cause this problem. This dosage schedule was selected because of the prolonged antiviral state that IFN confers on nasal cells and the course of rhinovirus replication in the nose, which peaks at 48 h and then falls. Other antivirals would be candidates for use in combination therapy.",

However, the symptom burden of rhinovirus and nonrhinovirus colds is greatest during the first 3 days of illness [25, 26] . Attacking symptoms after the cold is well developed is not an ideal strategy. A better strategy is to initiate treatment when the illness is first beginning and thus to prevent the symptom burden from ever reaching its peak. Early recognition of the onset of a cold appears to be practicable. In a study of patients with natural colds, 81% reported that the interval between the initial recognized symptom and when the patients \"knew they had a cold\" was \u044016 h [27] . This suggests that most persons can recognize early cold symptoms and thus initiate early treatment. An additional benefit of early treatment in this study was the reduction of the amount of nasal fluid produced and the need for nose blowing. The full treatment reduced expelled nasal fluid volume by 71% and nasal tissue use by 55%. This may result in less nasal fluid being propelled into the sinuses by nose blowing [28] .",
