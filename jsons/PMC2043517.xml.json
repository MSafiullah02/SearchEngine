Six-week-old female SJL/J mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were injected with 2 \u00d7 105 plaque-forming units (PFUs) of DA virus intracerebrally or 1 \u00d7 106 PFU of DA virus intravenously.24 Three weeks after injection, the left sciatic nerve was exposed surgically under anesthesia. We injected 2 \u03bcg of RCA I (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) in a 0.4-\u03bcl solution into the left sciatic nerve using a manual microinjector (Sutter Instrument Company, Novato, CA) fitted with a 500-\u03bcl syringe (Figure 1a). The RCA I solution contained 0.1% Fast Green FCF (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) to monitor the intraneural injection (Figure 1b). The skin was closed with wound clips. Control mice were injected with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) in the presence or absence of Fast Green FCF, or received no surgery. Fast Green FCF is a synthetic organic dye and widely used in food and scientific research. After surgery, mice were placed on the Deltaphase isothermal pad (Braintree Scientific, Inc., Braintree, MA) to keep the body temperature a constant 37\u00b0C. One week after surgery, mice were euthanized with isoflurane (IsoSol; Vedco Inc., St. Joseph, MO). Animal handling and protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Utah.",

CNS tissues were removed, and the surface of the injected side was labeled by India ink (Kuretake, Nara, Japan). The brains were divided into five coronal slabs and the spinal cords into 12 transverse slabs. The tissues were embedded in paraffin. Four-\u03bcm-thick sections were stained with Luxol fast blue for myelin visualization. Histological scoring was performed as described previously.27,28 For scoring spinal cord sections, each spinal cord section was divided into quadrants: the anterior funiculus, the posterior funiculus, and each lateral funiculus. Any quadrant containing meningitis, perivascular cuffing, or demyelination was given a score of 1 in that pathological class. The total number of positive quadrants for each pathological class was determined, divided by the total number of quadrants present on the slide, and multiplied by 100 to give the percent involvement for each pathological class. An overall pathology score was also determined by assigning a positive score if any pathology was present in the quadrant. This was also presented as percent involvement. Brain sections were scored for meningitis (0, no meningitis; 1, mild cellular infiltrates; 2, moderate cellular infiltrates; and 3, severe cellular infiltrates), perivascular cuffing (0, no cuffing; 1, 1 to 10 lesions; 2, 11 to 20 lesions; 3, 21 to 30 lesions; 4, 31 to 40 lesions; and 5, more than 40 lesions), and demyelination (0, no demyelination; 1, mild demyelination; 2, moderate demyelination; and 3, severe demyelination). Each score from the brain was combined for a maximum score of 11 per mouse.",

Titers of TMEV-specific antibodies were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described previously.29 TMEV antigen was prepared by infecting 80 to 90% confluent monolayers of BHK-21 cells with DA virus at an multiplicity of infection of 0.1 PFU/cell in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum, using tissue culture dishes (150 \u00d7 20 mm; Sarstedt Inc., Newton, NC). When most of the cells showed cytopathic effects (18 hours after infection), media were removed, and cells were washed three times in ice-cold PBS, scraped, and resuspended at 4 \u00d7 107 cells/ml in PBS. The cells were subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles. After the final thaw, the cells were sonicated with a microtip probe sonicator (Sonifier 250; Branson Ultrasonics Corporation, Danbury, CT) on ice. The cellular solution was centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 10 minutes at 15\u00b0C, and the supernatant was saved. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000 \u00d7 g for 1 hour. The pellet was resuspended in PBS and sonicated as before. The protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., Richmond, CA). TMEV antigen solution was stored at \u221270\u00b0C with 0.5 mmol/L thimerosal (Sigma-Aldrich). Ninety-six well plates were coated overnight with TMEV antigen at 4\u00b0C. After blocking with diluent [PBS containing 10% bovine calf serum (Cosmic Calf Serum; HyClone, Logan, UT) and 0.2% Tween 20], twofold dilutions of the mouse sera beginning at 1:27 were added to the plates and incubated at room temperature for 90 minutes. After washing with PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20, the plates were incubated with a peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Ig) G (H + L) (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD) in diluent for 90 minutes. The plates were colorized with o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich) and read at 492 nm on a Titertek Multiskan Plus MK II spectrophotometer (Flow Laboratories, McLean, VA). The endpoint of the assay was determined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution that gave an optical density reading that was 2 SDs more than the control baseline of sera from uninfected mice.",

By this route, exogenous substances can reach the CNS from the periphery circumventing the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Because RCA I can be transported via axonal flow, injection of RCA I into the sciatic nerve leads to the death of dorsal ganglion cells and subsequent degeneration of the ascending sensory tract that localizes in the posterior funiculus.36,37 We injected RCA I into the left sciatic nerve of na\u00efve mice to determine whether it could induce axonal degeneration in the left half of the posterior funiculus, corresponding with the side of the injected sciatic nerve (Figure 1c). One week after injection, the spinal cord appeared normal and neither demyelination nor inflammation was detected by Luxol fast blue staining (Figure 2c). Axonal swelling was noted in several nerve fibers by immunohistochemistry against nonphosphorylated NFP (Figure 2a). No microglial activation or T-cell infiltration was seen by lectin histochemistry or immunohistochemistry against CD3 (Figure 2d), respectively. Damaged axons were not observed in the spinal cords of PBS-injected mice or na\u00efve mice (Figure 2b).",

One week later, CNS pathology was compared among the groups. During this early chronic phase of TMEV infection, 4 weeks after infection, mice developed MNC infiltration in the meninges and perivascular spaces with demyelination in the white matter of the spinal cord, but not in the brain.20 In all three groups of mice, the anterior funiculus and the ventral root exit zone (VREZ) were most severely involved (Figure 3, a and b). As we reported previously,23 we found few lesions in the posterior funiculus of control TMEV-infected mice receiving no treatment (Figure 3d). In contrast, in TMEV-infected mice receiving RCA I, the posterior funiculi were demyelinated in several segments (Figure 3c). The demyelinating lesions were usually seen only in the left side (ipsilateral to the injection side) of the posterior funiculus (Figure 3c). In the demyelinated area, we detected microglia/macrophage and T-cell infiltration (Figure 3, e and g). Control TMEV-infected mice receiving no treatment had infiltrating cells comprised of macrophages and T cells in the anterior and lateral funiculi, but not in the posterior funiculus (Figure 3, f and h). Interestingly, we found changes in the posterior funiculus in some segments in the TMEV-infected control group receiving PBS. We tested whether there was a significant increase in spinal cord pathology by comparing spinal cord pathology scores between the groups.",

This was unexpected because we hypothesized that axonal damage alone could contribute to the recruitment of inflammatory cells in the left posterior funiculus, ipsilateral to the RCA I injection site, without an increase in virus. Thus, we tested whether the number of virus antigen-positive cells in the left posterior funiculus of infected mice receiving RCA I correlated with perivascular cuffing or demyelination. We found that virus persistence did not correlate with perivascular cuffing (r = 0.59, P = 0.16) or demyelination (r = 0.35, P = 0.44) in the left posterior funiculus of the RCA I-injected group (Figure 6, a and b). This suggests that there was no association between virus persistence and neuropathology in the left posterior funiculus, which is in accord with our prediction. Thus, virus persistence did not play a major role in induction of neuropathology at the posterior funiculus ipsilateral to the RCA I injection site. The presence of virus antigen-positive cells in this area could be attributable to recruitment of virus-infected macrophages.39",

This could be attributable to a lack of signaling in the CNS that is required for homing of inflammatory cells into the CNS. We investigated whether changes in the microenvironment within the CNS induced by RCA I injection were enough to recruit inflammatory cells into the CNS in mice infected with TMEV from the periphery. We infected mice intravenously with TMEV. Four weeks after infection, mice were divided into three groups: i) no injection, ii) PBS injection, and iii) RCA I injection into the sciatic nerve. One week after injection, we compared neuropathology among the groups. We found only one mouse in the PBS-injected group developed a mild demyelinating disease in the anterior and lateral funiculi, but not in the posterior funiculus of the spinal cord (data not shown). No lesions were found in TMEV-infected mice with RCA I injection or mice with TMEV infection alone.",

In this scenario, the lesion develops from the myelin (outside) to the axon (inside) (Outside-In model).12,26,41 In this Outside-In model, axonal degeneration can be regarded as a simple end result. On the other hand, in TMEV infection, we previously found that axonal damage precedes the demyelinating disease and that the distribution of damaged axons observed during the early phase corresponded to regions where subsequent demyelination occurs during the chronic phase of disease (Table 1, pathomechanism 1).24 Here, lesions develop from the axon (inside) to the myelin (outside) (Inside-Out model).12,26",

Although we found increased numbers of viral antigen-positive cells at the sites, there was no significant correlation between virus persistence with inflammation or demyelination. Our results suggest that, in TMEV infection, axonal damage is not a simple consequence of demyelination but can target inflammatory demyelinating lesions to sites of Wallerian degeneration (Table 1, pathomechanism 2). Our findings are similar to what has been reported in a rat adoptive-transfer experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model, in which axonal damage was induced in rats before encephalitogenic cells were adoptively transferred.42,43 In this model, besides the typical EAE lesions randomly distributed in areas known to be common in rat EAE (mainly in the spinal cord), an unusual distribution of inflammatory lesions was seen in the region where Wallerian degeneration was experimentally induced, ie, in the ipsilateral thalamus, which has a dense reciprocal connection to the cryolesioned neocortex, and in the optic tract and the superior colliculus, after optic nerve severing without disruption of the BBB. In some patients with MS, lesion development has been observed along the corticospinal tract in a pattern consistent with Wallerian degeneration.14,15,16,17",

However, at the last step, damaged myelin would be phagocytosed by activated macrophages/microglia, followed by myelin antigen presentation in the CNS. This could induce myelin-specific autoimmune responses, which can attack myelin from the outside, and inflammatory demyelination would lead to axonal damage secondarily. In this instance, pathology develops from the outside to the inside. Here, severe axonal damage leads to Wallerian degeneration of the distal stump of axons and trigger the second cascade reaction. Therefore, Inside-Out and Outside-In models can form a vicious cycle, independent of whichever event starts first. This might be the reason why some patients with MS develop progressive disease, in which axonal degeneration is a prominent feature.44 We propose that, regardless of the cause of demyelination (autoimmune or viral induced) or axonal damage (traumatic or toxin induced), Wallerian degeneration contributes to the dissemination of demyelinating lesions and/or initiates/triggers demyelination.",

As we will discuss in detail below, we did not see recruitment of T cells and macrophages to sites of axonal damage in uninfected mice injected with RCA I or RCA I-injected mice infected intravenously with TMEV. Similarly, in spinal cord injury in humans and in animal models, although axonal degeneration leads to secondary demyelination, no T cells are present in the lesions.12 Thus, there are multiple mechanisms for the evolution of lesion development. In some instances, axonal damage can lead to initiation or spread of demyelinating lesions, whereas in others, primary demyelination results in axonal damage without further lesion development. In MS, Werring and colleagues17 suggested that in some lesions there is a pathological process occurring before detectable BBB breakdown, whereas in other lesions, opening or alteration of the BBB is the earliest event. These authors demonstrated, in a serial diffusion magnetic resonance imaging study using MS patients, that there was an increase in the average apparent diffusion coefficient before the onset of gadolinium-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA) enhancement, indicating that structural changes in normal-appearing white matter occur before inflammation and BBB breakdown.17",

Differences in the extent of anti-viral immune responses between intracerebral versus intravenous infection may not explain a lack of CNS lesions in mice infected intravenously with TMEV. Intravenous injection of TMEV has been shown to induce active humoral and cellular immune responses against virus,30 but TMEV does not efficiently infect the CNS by this route and dose. Indeed, in our current experiments, we found similar levels of anti-TMEV antibody titers between intracerebral versus intravenous TMEV-infected groups (data not shown). Thus, recruitment of inflammatory cells seems to require additional parameters, such as virus persistence in the CNS, up-regulation of adhesion molecules on lymphocytes and/or CNS endothelial cells, or CNS virus replication and axonal degeneration, both of which are seen during the acute phase of intracerebral infection of TMEV.24",

In addition, we found that TMEV-infected mice injected with RCA I or PBS in the absence of Fast Green FCF developed similar pathology to TMEV-infected mice injected with RCA I or PBS in the presence of Fast Green FCF (data not shown). Thus, it is unlikely that Fast Green FCF itself plays a major role in recruitment of cells or inflammation.",

Intracranial injections of cytokines, such as interferon-\u03b3 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, have been shown to recruit T cells to the injection site.55,56 Phillips and Lampson57 reported that local injection of interferon-\u03b3 in the CNS resulted in T-cell recruitment, which was more effective in the brainstem than in the hippocampus. They suggested that the local CNS regulatory environment, such as vasculature and antigen distribution, contributes to site-specific recruitment of T cells in the CNS.",

In MS, select areas within the CNS are often affected, whereas the mechanism for the preferential vulnerability of the CNS regions is unknown; for example, periventricular areas are often demyelinated in the classical form of MS, and the optic tract is involved in the opticospinal form of MS.62 The periventricular regions can be attacked or modified after infection of the cerebrospinal fluid, whereas the optic pathway can be vulnerable to trauma or infection of the eye and optic nerve (Table 1, pathomechanism 2). Thus, axonal damage in such regions may play a role in recruiting inflammatory cells and targeting demyelinating lesions to specific sites.",
