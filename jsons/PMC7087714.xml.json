The semiconductor titanium dioxide (TiO2) is the most widely studied photocatalyst. The photosensitizing action of titanium dioxide was first observed in 1929, when as a pigment used in paint, it was found to be responsible for paint fading. This paint fading was because of the photodegradation of the polymer organic binder of the paint by the action of TiO2. However, work towards the development of photocatalytic theory, using titanium dioxide as a photocatalyst, gained momentum in the late 1960s [11].",

            "text": "The huge interest generated by photocatalysis has motivated several researchers to look into the basic mode of action of TiO2, which is now fairly well understood. TiO2 is a semiconductor with a band gap close to 3.2 eV, and UV light with wavelengths shorter than \u223c 380 nm photoactivates TiO2 by providing the band gap energy needed by an electron to jump from the valence band to the conduction band. This implies that when photons of UV-A light are absorbed on TiO2, they generate excited pairs of electrons and holes. The photogenerated holes react with the water to produce hydroxyl radicals (\u2022OH), while the photogenerated electrons react with molecular oxygen to give superoxide radical anions (\u2022O2\u2212). These radicals so produced are highly reactive and they work together to completely oxidize the organic species. The attack by the \u2022OH radical, in the presence of oxygen, thus initiates a complex cascade of oxidative reactions. The mechanism of the photocatalytic process has been extensively studied in the literature and several complex reaction pathways have been reported [7, 16, 29, 35]. Although the exact mechanism of the process and the reaction pathways are still not clear, the practical applications that these processes offer have fueled enormous commercial interest.",

They investigated the effectiveness of photocatalytic oxidation of several microorganisms such as Lactobacillus acidophilus (gram positive bacteria), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast), Escherichia coli (gram negative bacteria) and Chlorella vulgaris (green algae) in water. Their results show killing of the microbial cells in 60\u2013120 min using a TiO2\u2013Pt photocatalyst. They determined that the mode of action of the process was the photooxidation of Coenzyme A (CoA) leading to inhibition of cell respiration and thus cell death. The process was not entirely effective against Chlorella vulgaris though, because of its thicker cell wall [27]. This led to an extensive research in the field of photocatalytic oxidation for destruction of various microorganisms including bacteria, viruses, fungi, algae, and protozoa. Recent review articles [4, 10, 12, 28] provide a comprehensive coverage of the application of TiO2 photocatalysis to disinfection.",

Their group even reported inactivation of dust mite antigens by photocatalytic oxidation.

In 2003, Kuhn et al.

Because of the high degree of resistance of bacterial spores to various disinfectants, and hence their slow kinetics of inactivation [2, 31], a logarithmic scale to plot inactivation was disregarded in favor of the less conventional method of plotting percentage destruction of spores. Destruction of B. cereus spores on both metal and fabric substrates with the Ag-doped TiO2 P25 (enhanced photocatalyst) was studied, and compared with conventional TiO2 photocatalysis and UV-A photolysis. The Ag+ ions from the dopant act as an electron trap in the photocatalysis process. This reduces the recombination between electrons and holes, and thus results in an increased availability of holes. The synergistic effect of the doped Ag+ ions, and highly oxidizing radicals generated by TiO2 photocatalysis process, may lead to a highly enhanced rate of microbial destruction.",

The percentage destruction data for UV-A photolysis had a standard deviation close to \u00b15%. Generally Bacillus endospores are highly resistant to UV radiation [30]. Riesenman and Nicholson [31] have shown that the Bacillus endospores possess a thick spore protein coating that provides resistance to sporicidal substances. They reported that UV-A wavelength becomes effective as a sporocide in case of mutation of spores that may lead to damage of this spore coat. Partially damaged spore protein coating may be a possible explanation of the destruction as observed with UV-A photolysis. The UV-A photolysis control test, however, was ineffective in complete destruction of B. cereus spores.",

Faster destruction was observed with almost 76% of the spores getting destroyed in the first 4 h and 99% in 24 h (standard deviation close to \u00b13%). A possible explanation for this reduced rate of destruction at longer time intervals could be that the spores being living entities may have varying resistance to attack by \u2022OH radicals. Thus, the less resistant spores were destroyed in the first few hours and the more resistant ones survived for longer durations. It could also be due to the increasing amounts of dead spores and by-products generated by the photocatalytic oxidation of spores that may lead to quenching of \u2022OH radicals and shielding of light [32]. Another explanation could be the possibility of spore agglomeration on metal substrate leading to reduced exposure to \u2022OH radicals. The spore agglomeration could be avoided by adding a small quantity of surfactant to the spore suspension before dispersal on the samples. However, the use of a surfactant was avoided in this study as it may lead to germination of bacterial spores to vegetative bacterial cells, which are much easier to inactivate.",
