Genetic manipulation of fulllength cDNA clones has become an especially important and widely used tool to study the biology, pathogenesis, and virulence determinants of both positive and negative stranded RNA viruses. The first full-length infectious cDNA clone of equine arteritis virus (EAV) was developed in 1996 and was also the first full-length infectious cDNA clone constructed from a member of the order Nidovirales. This clone was extensively used to characterize the molecular biology of EAV and other Nidoviruses. The objective of this review is to summarize the characterization of the virulence (or attenuation) phenotype of the recombinant viruses derived from several infectious cDNA clones of EAV in horses, as well as their application for characterization of the molecular basis of viral neutralization, persistence, and cellular tropism.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "in horses by the late Dr. William H. McCollum and colleagues at the University of Kentucky (Fig. 1) . The repeated serial passage of this original \"Bucyrus virus\" in its natural host markedly enhanced its virulence. The H9 (horse passage 9) and H15 (horse passage 15) strains of the passaged virus consistently caused severe clinical disease, and frequently death in horses (60% fatality rate; so-called \"velogenic or virulent Bucyrus EAV\") following experimental inoculation (MacLachlan et al., 1996; McCollum and Timoney, 1999) . Following the creation of continuous cell lines, the H15 virus (pleural fluid archived by the late Drs. Roger Doll and William H. McCollum) was passaged in rabbit kidney (RK-13) cells and aliquots of this RK-13 passaged Bucyrus strain of EAV were deposited in the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA; catalog number VR-796). Significantly, many historic references to use of the putative \"Bucyrus strain of EAV\" do not, in fact, include the original virus associated with the 1953 EVA outbreak. Unfortunately, the original Bucyrus virus and the subsequent horse passage strains (up to 9th horse passage [H9] ) have all been lost due to freezer failures. Only the archived pleural fluid from horse passage 15 (H15, also identified as EAV VB53 or virulent Bucyrus strain [VBS] ) and the limited RK-13 passaged derivative of this virus (ATCC VR-796) now remain. Full-length genome sequence analysis of these two viruses (H15 and ATCC VR-796) in our laboratory has shown them to be 99.9% identical, and both cause fatal EVA in the majority of experimentally inoculated horses (MacLachlan et al., 1996; McCollum and Timoney, 1999) . Thus, the pleural fluid from the original 15th horse passage and the ATCC VR-796 are now both designated as the VBS strain of EAV. Importantly, however, VBS is itself an artifact in that it causes severe, often fatal disease in horses, whereas field strains of EAV do not typically cause fatal disease in adult horses (Balasuriya et al., 2013 and references therein; Balasuriya and Maclachlan, 2004; McCollum and Timoney, 1999) .

This original VBS virus was then extensively passaged in vitro, and sometimes plaque purified, in different laboratories. These extensively cell culture passaged, essentially laboratory-adapted EAV strains are often misleadingly designated as Bucyrus EAV without any reference to their passage history. Simply stated, these are highly cell culture passaged laboratory derivatives of the VBS strain of EAV, with distinctive genetic sequences and phenotypic properties. Finally, although the VBS strain of EAV is itself somewhat of a laboratory aberration due to its sequential experimental passage in horses, this virus is useful for studying virulence determinants of EAV and mechanisms of viral pathogenesis. Furthermore, the current modified live virus (MLV; live attenuated) EAV vaccine (ARVAC s , Zoetis, Kalamazoo, MI, USA) used for immunization of horses in the United States was originally produced by extensive cell culture passage of EAV VBS, as were laboratory strains such as EAV 030 from which the original infectious cDNA clone was derived (van Dinten et al., 1997) (Fig. 2) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1196, "end": 1221, "text": "(van Dinten et al., 1997)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1222, "end": 1230, "text": "(Fig. 2)", "ref_id": null}], "section": ""}, {"text": "It has long been known that positive-sense viral RNA is infectious and can generate progeny virus following its introduction into cells.

Subsequently, Racaniello and Baltimore (1981a, b) developed the first infectious cDNA clone of poliovirus by cloning the full-length RNA genome into a bacterial plasmid vector. The advent of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technology in the mid-1980s, along with other recombinant DNA techniques, expedited the development of infectious cDNA clones of other RNA viruses (Boyer and Haenni, 1994; Mullis and Faloona, 1987) . It was subsequently shown in numerous virus systems that in vitro transcripts of cDNA clones, and in some instances the cDNA itself, can initiate a complete productive infectious cycle in susceptible mammalian cells. As a result, genetic manipulation (reverse genetics) of full-length cDNA clones has become the most important tool to study the biology, pathogenesis, and virulence determinants of both positive and negative stranded RNA viruses.

Similar to other positive stranded RNA viruses, the genomes of Arteriviruses are infectious to cells (Meulenberg et al., 1993; van der Zeijst and Horzinek, 1975) . The first full-length infectious cDNA clone of EAV was developed in 1996 by cloning twelve fragments from a cDNA library spanning the entire genome of a highly cell culture adapted laboratory strain of EAV downstream of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter in the pUC18 plasmid vector (pEAV 030 [GenBank accession number Y07862], Fig. 2 ) (van Dinten et al., 1997) . This was also the first full-length infectious cDNA clone constructed from a member of the order Nidovirales. A second infectious cDNA clone of a very similar, highly cell culture-adapted laboratory strain of EAV was described soon thereafter (de Vries et al., 2000 (de Vries et al., , 2001 Glaser et al., 1999) . More recently, we have described the development of two infectious cDNA clones of EAV; the first from the highly-virulent, horseadapted VBS strain of EAV (pEAVrVBS [DQ846751]) (Balasuriya et al., 2007) and the other from the MLV vaccine strain of EAV (ARVAC s , Zoetis, Kalamazoo, MI, USA, pEAVrMLV [FJ798195]) that was originally developed by extended cell culture passage of the VBS virus.

Horses inoculated with rVBS all developed severe clinical signs of EVA, including high fever, marked lymphopenia, petechial and ecchymotic hemorrhages in the oral mucous membranes, serous nasal discharge, supraorbital and limb edema of variable severity, and skin eruptions (hives). All horses developed high titer viremia with significant virus shedding in their nasal secretions. EAV was isolated for 28-56 days post-infection (DPI) from buffy coat, up to 12 DPI from plasma, and nasal shedding was detected until 10-12 DPI. Virus clearance coincided with the appearance of neutralizing antibodies in serum.

Both attenuated viruses had amino acid substitutions in nsp1 (Val51-Met, Ser141-Asn, and Ile156-Thr), nsp9 (Asp1970-Gly), GP4 (Leu8-Ser), GP5 (Asn81-Asp), and M (Ile122-Val, Ala154-Thr).

This substitution was conserved among all of the cell culture adapted viruses. The variable retention of the glycosylation site at position 81 in the GP5 protein among field strains of EAV further suggests this residue might play a central role in EAV virulence and pathogenesis (Balasuriya et al., 1997 (Balasuriya et al., , 1998 (Balasuriya et al., , 1999a (Balasuriya et al., , 2004b Zhang et al., 2008b Zhang et al., , 2010 .

Site-directed mutagenesis was used to individually introduce the four amino acid substitutions in the nsps 1, 2, and 7 of the pEAVrVBS infectious clone (the new recombinant virus was identified as rVBS/Vacc NS4m), and the ten amino acid substitutions contained in the structural proteins (GP2, GP4, GP5, ORF5a protein, and M) of the HK116 virus were introduced by swapping ORFs2-7 of the HK116 virus in their entirety into the pEAVrVBS clone (chimeric rVBS/HK116 S virus; Tables 3 and 4 ). Horses inoculated with the chimeric rVBS/HK116 S virus developed only mild serous nasal discharge whereas some of the horses inoculated with rVBS/Vacc NS4m developed typical clinical signs of EVA, confirming that this virus is less attenuated than rVBS/HK116 S (Table 7) . Since both recombinant viruses share the backbone of the virulent pEAVrVBS infectious clone, the virulence phenotypes of the rVBS/HK116 S and rVBS/Vacc NS4m viruses were also compared to that of the virulent parental rVBS virus. The average body temperature of the rVBS-inoculated horses was significantly higher than that of horses inoculated with either the rVBS/HK116 S or rVBS/Vacc NS4m viruses. Whereas nasal virus shedding and viremia were similar between rVBS-and rVBS/VaccNS4m-inoculated horses, both nasal shedding of virus and viremia in rVBS/HK116 Sinoculated horses were significantly lower than those in horses inoculated with either the rVBS-or rVBS/Vacc NS4m viruses. In summary, the rVBS/HK116 S virus had substantially reduced virulence for horses as compared to the parental rVBS strain, and the rVBS/Vacc NS4m virus caused only subclinical infection. Taken together these data suggest that amino acid changes in either the replicase (nsp1, nsp2 and nsp7) or structural proteins (GP2, GP4, GP5 and M) led to attenuation, but the recombinant virus with multiple substitutions in the structural proteins was more attenuated than the recombinant virus with substitutions only in the replicase proteins.

The rVBS/HK116 S chimeric virus containing the structural proteins of the HK116 virus (which is fully attenuated for horses as compared to the VBS virus) in the rVBS backbone infected significantly fewer CD3 \u00fe T lymphocytes as compared to the rVBS virus. In contrast, the percentage of CD14 \u00fe monocytes infected by the two viruses was similar, indicating that the tropism of the HK116 strain had changed for CD3 \u00fe T lymphocytes but not for CD14 \u00fe monocytes following 116 passages in HK cells. When susceptible lymphocytes and monocytes were infected with rVBS/MLV S and rMLV/VBS S viruses, rVBS/MLV S did not infect CD3 \u00fe T lymphocytes and replicated in CD14 \u00fe monocytes at only a very low level, which was identical to what occurred following infection with the rMLV virus. In contrast, the rMLV/VBS S virus infected and replicated in both CD3 \u00fe T lymphocytes and CD14 \u00fe monocytes, similar to the rVBS virus. These results strongly suggest that the structural proteins of the VBS virus are responsible for determining its tropism for lymphocytes and monocytes. Furthermore, comparison of dual-color flow cytometric analysis of PBMCs infected with rVBS/HK116 S and rVBS/MLV S showed significant differences in CD14 \u00fe monocyte infectivity, indicating that amino acid substitutions that occurred during further cell culture passage of the HK116 virus may have contributed to the change in monocyte tropism.

Therefore, the higher relative fluorescence intensity values observed in monocytes infected with rMLV/VBS 56 (Fig. 6 , panel n) as compared to rMLV/VBS 234 (Fig. 6 , panel l), suggests that the GP5 and M protein sequences may play a greater role than those of E, GP2, GP3, and GP4 in facilitating monocyte infections, although both the major and minor envelope glycoproteins appear to be important in determining monocyte tropism. In summary, the data suggest that the difference in cellular tropism and virulence phenotype of the VBS and MLV strains of EAV is associated with the collective interactions of both major (GP5 and M) and minor (GP2, GP3, and GP4) envelope proteins.

The neutralization phenotype of each recombinant chimeric/mutant strain of EAV was determined with EAV-specific MAbs and polyclonal equine antisera, and compared to that of their parental viruses from which the substituted ORF5 was derived. Substitution of individual amino acids within the GP5 ectodomain usually resulted in differences in the neutralization phenotype of the recombinant viruses that were analogous to differences in the neutralization phenotype of field strains of EAV. These studies unequivocally confirm that the GP5 ectodomain contains critical determinants of EAV neutralization, that individual neutralization sites (A-D) are conformationally interactive, and that interaction of GP5 with the unglycosylated membrane protein M is likely critical to expression of individual epitopes in neutralizing conformation.
