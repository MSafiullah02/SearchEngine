In this context, most of recent approaches exploit similarity learning through comparing spatial-temporal patterns between normal and irregular records. However, they are limited in utilizing passenger-level information. First, all passenger transits are fused in a certain region at a timestamp whereas each passenger has own repetitive stops and time slots. Second, these differences in passenger profile result in high intraclass variance of normal records and blur the decision boundaries. To tackle these problems, we propose a modelling framework to extract passenger-level spatial-temporal profile and present a personalised similarity learning for irregular behavior detection. Specifically, a route-tostop embedding is proposed to extract spatial correlations between transit stops and routes. Then attentive fusion is adopted to uncover spatial repetitive and time invariant patterns. Finally, a personalised similarity function is learned to evaluate the historical and recent mobility patterns. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on recall, F1 score and accuracy. Raw features and the extracted patterns are visualized and illustrate the learned deviation between the normal and the irregular records.",

However, in recent years, with a growing availability of individual mobility data, detecting irregularities regarding individual mobility in public transport system and quantifying the impacts of these become increasingly important, which can help the system operator and planner to more proactively accommodate both systematic behavior variations and stochasticity related to travel in public transit systems. At the same time, discovering and preventing potential fraudulent behavior with smart transit cards is also important in many cities. For example, the public transit card in cities such as Sydney, Melbourne, and Hong Kong is often linked to users' credit cards. Moreover, public transit cards in some cities (e.g., Octopus card in Hong Kong) can also be used to purchase daily goods from a variety of shops. Detecting irregular and potential fraudulent behavior with smart transit cards at early stages may help avoid considerable loss of travelers who lose their smart transit cards.",

First, convolutional-based or graph-based methods are adopted for describing spatial connections and layout for different stops [1, 5, 14] . Then a sequential layer is applied to model temporal correlations among historical transits. In this way, the model is able to predict a traffic-related value for a location at a timestamp. Finally, similarity-based algorithms are used to compare different passenger patterns. The similarity function can either be measured by a statistical distance metric between the normal and fraud data, or defined by a reconstruction error derived from an encoder-decoder structure [6, 13, 16] . Therefore, a reference passenger pattern can be discriminated from a potential irregular/fraudulent pattern.",

Besides, most of the existing fraud or irregularity detection methods only consider all passenger data in an aggregate manner and learn a decision boundary for common outlier patterns. However, these methods tend to fail when normal data has high intra-class variance, meaning that normal data is not compacted and the boundary between the normal and fraud data is blurry, or reconstructed errors are high even for normal data. This is exactly the case of mobility pattern where one passenger's normal record can be another one's abnormal data and totally confuses the aforementioned methods, thus calling for a personalised fraudulent behavior detection method.",

One typical approach is to use convolutional layers over a spatial map and to use recurrent layers over a time sequence. Lan et al. [7] and Chen et al. [3] adopted convolutional layers on the morphological layout of a city and LSTM to estimate travel time and predict urban air quality index. Recently convolutional graph networks have drawn more attention in helping discover non-linearity correlation between nodes and edges in a graph [5, 17] . Each node is represented by a vector while connections of each node are represented by an adjacency matrix or by fixed edge features. Nevertheless, most of existing approaches [1, 14] fuse passenger features in a node, while features on the same node can be dynamic for different passengers, since two passengers on the same stop may have different time slot preference. Also, usually nodes were built by segmenting city layout into hundreds of grids so as to compute adjacency matrix. However, in our scenario nodes are tens of thousands of transit stops, demanding highly expensive computation to build a traditional graph.",

The distance-based approaches assume that normal data are compact in distribution and far from sparse fraud. Conventional methods include isolation Forest [9] , and One-Class Support Vector Machine. Present deep learning-based models try to learn a distinguished density space between the normal and fraud data [10, 11, 15] . DevNet [10] defines a deviation loss based on z-score of a prior Gaussian distribution and squeezes the outliers to the tail of the distribution. Perera et al. [11] present a compactness and a descriptiveness loss for one-class learning. Yoon et al. [15] propose a learnable scoring matrix to detecting incongruity between news headline and body text. The reconstruction based methods adopt encoder-decoder structures and claim that fraud can not be well-reconstructed through the structure. Cao et al. [2] and Xu et al. [13] propose variation-auto-encoder based models with extensive experiments. Zhang et al. [16] detect fraud on reconstructed residual correlation matrix. LSTM-NDT [6] and OmniAnomaly [12] adopt dynamic thresholding on reconstructed feature errors. Despite great effectiveness, these approaches tend to underperform in our task due to high intra-class variance of normal data, where one passenger's normal records can be irregular/fraudulent for others.",

Firstly, the proposed route-to-stop embedding does not need to compute tens of thousands of node features in a graph. Instead, it only concentrates on personalised nodes for each passenger, meanwhile maintaining the ability of abstracting node and edge correlations. Furthermore, this study directly applies a personalised similarity function to learn the discrepancy between historical and new records for each passenger. In this way, the variance of data can be reduced by only focusing records of the same passenger. Therefore, the high intra-class variance problem of some existing approaches is avoided.",

            "text": "Data Description. We use public transit card of the Greater Sydney area (Opal card) in the case study. In total 187,000 passenger records were collected from April 1st to 30th, 2017. Each record is characterized with transit stop features and route features. Transit stop features consist of tap on/off time, longitude/latitude and postcode of stops, stop id and whether the tap is a transfer from another vehicle. Transit route features include vehicle type, vehicle id, duration, distance bands, journey costs and run direction. In this way, every record can be described as a starting stop to an ending stop through a route, and a passenger can be represented as a sequence of such records. As demonstrated in Fig. 1 , there are four transit stops marked as red and three connecting routes for this passenger. Each stop has one or more records, representing the passenger pattern such as visiting frequency. From Fig. 1 , it is able to profile a passenger through spatial-temporal pattern. For instance, a route is made from Milsons Point Station to Town Hall Station nearly every weekday morning, indicating home/office location and potential occupation of the passenger. These repetitive stops together with less visiting stops, each with their own time invariant pattern, profile a unique passenger. We hereby aim to leverage this profile by excavating spatial correlations between transit stops and temporal preferences for each route, named \"personalised spatial-temporal profile\" for short. We expect to learn discriminative passenger profile, which can not only help transit operators provide more customised service, but can also alert passengers when irregular/fraudulent behavior occurs.",

Historical pattern u N and the latest pattern u N +1 are extracted and compared from the corresponding data {x 1 , x 2 , ..., x N } and x N +1 to detect a irregular/fraudulent behavior. There are four major components in the framework: a route-to-stop embedding to describe the spatial mapping function from routes to stops, an attentive fusion to capture repetitive and time invariant pattern, a fully connected layer to extract recent pattern, and a similarity function to learn the discrepancy between the historical and recent patterns. Route-to-Stop Embedding (R2S). As mentioned before, every record is featured by two transit stops and a route. Instead of directly input raw features x i = (s i1 , s i2 , r i ) into the model, we want to map two stop features s i1 , s i2 into the same space since starting and ending stops share the same raw input space. Also, stop and route features (s i , r i ) have strong dependency correlations, for example, in Fig. 1 , given route features like vehicle id, time duration and cost and starting stop features like tap on time and location, it is possible to speculate corresponding ending stop features. Hence, route features should also be projected to the same space as transit stops. Inspired by [4] , a route-tostop(R2S) embedding that is generalizable for each passenger is proposed to represent spatial correlation: {route r i : starting stop s i1 \u2192 ending stop s i2 }:",

This can also be concluded from Fig. 5(a) where difference between KL(normal||historical) and KL(fraud||historical) is negligible. After passenger pattern extraction, both differences are enlarged in Fig. 4 (b) and Fig. 5(b) , indicating that the model is pushing recent data away from historical one yet push irregular/fraudulent data harder so as to be distinctive. Also, there is a clear boundary between irregular/fraudulent and normal data.",

We managed to extract passenger-level spatial-temporal profile and present a personalised similarity learning for detection. More specifically, a route-to-stop embedding is first proposed to exploit spatial correlations between different transit stops and routes. Then attentive fusion is adopted to find spatial repetitive and time invariant pattern. Finally, a personalised similarity function is learned to discriminate the historical and recent mobility patterns. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms baseline methods in terms of recall, F1 score, and accuracy. Moreover, with 20% of the total fraud/irregular data, we can achieve state-of-the-art performance. Visualization on learned patterns reveals that the method can learn distinctive features among the irregularity/fraud and the normal records.",
