These structures developed in response to the challenges of industrialization and urbanization along with growing scientific and applied methodologies for disease prevention and health promotion. Non-governmental charitable, religious, and advocacy organizations pioneered many services that were part of addressing the broad spectrum of public health needs. With the widening range of public responsibilities, state and national governments took on increasing roles of leadership. These included financial support and professional development of public health and, in parallel, medical care systems to meet the growing public expectation for good health. These challenges remain important for current and future needs of both individual and population health. In the USA the high and rising cost of health care, and lack of universal insurance coverage are continuing political and public health issues, while many other industrialized countries have better health outcomes such as longer life expectancy (see Chapters 11 and 13Chapter 11Chapter 13).",

The Elizabethan Poor Laws in Britain in the early seventeenth century established the responsibility of the local authority for health and welfare.

In contrast to most industrialized countries, the USA lacks universal health care. As a result, health care is provided through a mix of independent, private, and public agencies. While this is sometimes described as a \u201cnon-system\u201d, it is in fact a complex network of interactive services. Yet, it lacks universality, leaving many individuals without access to even basic private health care. As a result, public health organizations in the USA play a very important role in providing essential services for people or needs not otherwise met. Yet there are socioeconomic, ethnic, and regional variations and inequalities in insurance coverage and resource allocation, leaving substandard access and outcomes for many in the US health system. Public health has played a leadership role particularly in advocacy, development, and achievement in promoting health, partly to compensate for this fragmentation of health care in the USA. In many ways medium and low income countries are similar in lacking universal care, so that the institutions of US public health provide examples of infrastructure development needed to meet deficiencies in any health system.",

Consequently, primary responsibility for health rested with a combination of the state, provincial, regional, or local levels of government. However, because of greater resources at the national level, federal government roles have increased in the health field over the years. National governments have a responsibility to ensure equity of social policy. A growing federal or national role has been a historical process common to many countries.

Countries with governments based on the French Napoleonic Code, including most Spanish-speaking countries, are examples. In these countries, the central government has great responsibility for health, but here, too, local government is still a major factor in sanitation and local public health. The powers of regional and local authorities are derived from the national structure. Public health grew initially at the local level with regulations for sanitation, business premises and product licensing, food safety, and the like. In the UK, the national government promoted local public health organization, later organizing personal health services programs for the entire population in the centrally controlled National Health Service (NHS) (UK National Audit Office 2012).",

Diffusion or sharing of responsibility from each level of authority is common in current planning to cope with the wide range of activities and interests that make up the health sector of a society. Non-governmental agencies (NGOs) often precede governmental authority in the field, and their presence and participation make up important elements of the health complex, whether as providers of services, as advocates, or as fundraisers for programs that a government cannot manage to include in its \u201cbasket of services\u201d.",

Initial cases were diagnosed by an astute physician in Tennessee and traced to a pharmaceutical company in Massachusetts, with cases then appearing widely across the country. Investigation showed contamination in the production site; the offending material was withdrawn from pharmacies and the company\u2019s operation was closed (Box 10.4\n).BOX 10.4US Iatrogenic Fungal Meningitis Outbreak 2012: Lessons Learned from the National Distribution with State-Based RegulationDetection and control of infectious disease outbreaks require a concerted effort by frontline and specialty clinicians, local and regional and/or state public health professionals, and national level scientists and regulators. The 2012 outbreak of fungal meningitis in the USA due to contamination of preservative-free methyl prednisolone acetate illustrates several of the strengths and weaknesses of this approach.Meningitis is an infection of the central nervous system, specifically of the fluid and materials that surround the brain and spinal cord. This system is normally sterile, but injections of medications near or into the spinal column can cause contamination. Agents that can cause meningitis are typically viruses or bacteria, but meningitis due to fungi can occur.In early September 2012, patients began to present to emergency departments and other sites with symptoms consistent with meningitis but without common causal agents. An infectious disease expert at a Tennessee academic medical center identified one of the initial patients and, given the unusual etiological agent, reported the case via email to the State Health Department of Tennessee (TDOH). There, the Director of the Healthcare Associated Infections, among others, began to look for other patients. As noted by the New York Times report on the investigation, while physicians and other clinicians on the frontlines are most likely to detect initial cases, \u201conly health departments and other governmental agencies have the ability and authority to track down additional cases to document disease outbreaks and warn those at risk. It is work that private groups seldom can do\u201d.Within 48 hours of the first report, the TDOH notified the US federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); the key point was the unusual fungal agent involved. After consultation with the CDC, the TDOH inspected the facility where the index case received treatment, and identified potential causes, such as local contamination due to environmental contamination, mishandling of equipment, or contamination at the compounding source. Similar to case identification and tracking those potentially exposed, inspection of health care facilities requires authority usually reserved only for state and national regulatory agencies.While narrowing the possible causes, the TDOH reached out directly to the out-of-state compounding source, as well as the state health department in that state (Massachusetts, MDOH). The company voluntarily recalled potentially tainted lots of the medications. The US agency that oversees most drug manufacture in the USA, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), was also informed. Here, the lines of authority and responsibility overlap, and the outbreak reveals potential weaknesses in state and federal regulation. Compounding companies are not routinely regulated by the FDA, as such businesses are technically pharmacies. In the USA, pharmacies are routinely overseen by professional boards, often including volunteer professionals.Clinicians in many other states began to report fungal meningitis cases to their state health departments, and the CDC coordinated formal national surveillance. Finally, within 8 days of the initial email report to the TDOH, the MDOH conducted a detailed inspection of the production facility involved. The company voluntarily recalled all of its products and shut down. A month later, a preliminary report by MDOH noted contamination of floors, floors mats, and a leaking boiler, all near sterile mixing areas. An FDA report found that many of the drug vials contained foreign matter and that the \u201cclean\u201d compounding rooms had either mold or bacterial overgrowth, or both.By 15 November 2012, over 400 cases of fungal infection due to the contaminated drug had been found, with 32 deaths, and over 14,000 potential exposed patients. In reaction to the situation, hearings at the national level were scheduled to discuss the need for regulatory changes. The director of the Massachusetts Board of Pharmacy has been fired, while new cases are still occurring, and recurrence in some of the initial cases is being documented.Sources: DiFerdinando GD.

A public policy of allowing high speed limits or increasing the speed limit accounted for an estimated 12,545 deaths in the USA over a 10-year period of follow-up. The US Department of Transportation estimated in 2002 that the comprehensive cost of each fatality was US$977,000 and the cost for each critically injured person was US$1.1 million, so that the 10-year cumulative cost for fatalities alone of repealing the 55 mph speed limit was approximately US$12 billion. The department reports that in 2010 there were 3092 deaths and 416,000 injuries in distraction-affected motor vehicle accidents. Distracted driving includes the use of cell phones or performance of other tasks while driving (see Chapter 5). Local and state legislation regarding the enforcement of drink\u2013driving laws, mandatory use of seat belts, safe car seats for children, helmets for motorcyclists and bicycle riders, education, and enforcement against use of cell phones while driving are all necessary to reduce the toll of death and disability from road crashes (see Chapter 5).",

In the USA, the March of Dimes (Box 10.5\n) is an outstanding example of a volunteer organization and its contribution in the development of the Salk polio vaccine in the 1940s, subsequently in the care of people affected by poliomyelitis and, currently, in the prevention of birth defects. There are many organizations raising funds for promotion of research and services for specific health concerns, ranging from diabetes to multiple sclerosis.BOX 10.5The March of DimesFounded in 1938 to address the issue of poliomyelitis by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a 1921 victim of polio himself, the March of Dimes (MOD) played a major role in providing care for polio-stricken children and the search for a vaccine to prevent the disease. Thousands of volunteers helped to raise funds and to organize widescale clinical trials of the breakthrough vaccine developed by Jonas Salk in 1955. Following the eradication of polio in the USA, the March of Dimes shifted its focus to major health problems of children: birth defects, low birth weight, infant mortality, and lack of prenatal care.The MOD\u2019s 2005 Global Report on Birth Defects states: \u201cEvery year an estimated 8 million children \u2013 6 percent of total births worldwide \u2013 are born with a serious birth defect of genetic or partially genetic origin. Additionally, hundreds of thousands more are born with serious birth defects of postconception origin due to maternal exposure to environmental agents. At least 3.3 million children less than 5 years of age die annually because of serious birth defects and the majority of those who survive may be mentally and physically disabled for life\u201d.The organization promotes and funds activities to reduce birth defects and infant mortality by measures to prevent low birth weight (to 5 percent or less), and to increase the number of women receiving prenatal care in the first trimester (to 90 percent). It funds work to promote genetic research including gene therapy, testing, counseling, and gene mapping. MOD promotes work on the Human Genome Project with genes related to immune disorders, mental retardation, leukemia, improved blood tests for newborn screening, and improved perinatal care for cerebral palsy and respiratory distress of the newborn. MOD works actively to promote use of folic acid among women in the age of fertility to reduce risks of neural tube defects, and supports comprehensive newborn screening for all babies, for at least 29 conditions for which there are good screening capacity and management of affected children.Source: March of Dimes.

Activities include preparation of essential supplies, organizational guidelines, staff training and orientation, as well as adequate funding to meet these needs. Since disasters with mass casualties may appear in many forms, the response teams need flexibility and capacity for improvization. Coordination between different levels of government can be difficult, with lines of command and lateral communication unclear and potentially disastrous. Preparation for treatment of mass casualties of bioterrorism requires similar resources to a situation of pandemic and mass illness due to a new variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or avian influenza (Box 10.7\n).BOX 10.7Lessons from Recent Disasters and Threatened PandemicsThe twenty-first century began with the 9/11 massive terrorist attack on New York City\u2019s World Trade Center in Manhattan using hijacked civilian aircraft, causing over 2500 deaths and many injuries. This event stirred worldwide repercussions and was followed by deadly terrorist strikes in Madrid, London, Bali, Mumbai, and many other parts of the world. These attacks caused national and international reactions including calls for disaster preparedness with stress on local capacity for response to human-caused and natural disasters, with emphasis on basic \u201cfirst responder\u201d service capacity.During 2003, a threatened pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) started in China and, in a short time was transmitted via an infected person to Toronto, Canada. The Canadian provincial and municipal authorities were taken by surprise and lacked adequate federal mechanisms for addressing the problem. Provincial and municipal authorities managed the epidemic by hospitalization and isolation of all suspected cases with quarantining of hospitals involved. As a result of review of this experience, Canadian governmental authorities developed new federal institutions, in part modeled on the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, establishing a federal Public Health Agency whose director was also a deputy minister in the federal Department of Health, with direct authority to increase the federal presence in epidemic control.In 2004\u20132005, three huge natural disasters occurred in different parts of the world, showing the crucial importance of disaster preparedness and response organization, preparation, and intergovernmental coordination. The tsunami in Thailand and surrounding regions, Hurricane Katrina in Louisiana and especially New Orleans, and the earthquake in northern Pakistan showed the crucial need for coordination and speed as well as preparation for natural disasters by all levels of government working with voluntary organizations for rescue and relocation needs.In 2006, the H5N1 influenza virus, also called \u201cavian flu\u201d, threatened to become a new world pandemic of a scope similar to the influenza pandemic of 1917\u20131918. National and world public health organizations mobilized under the leadership of the WHO, implementing monitoring and control measures. These largely rest on identification of cases among wild and domestic birds, and the rapid identification, isolation, and treatment of human cases. Culling of domestic agricultural birds took place to restrict transmission of the H5N1 virus, which could produce a human pandemic of epic proportions if transmitted from birds to humans and then by human-to-human transmission.In May 2008, a cyclone disaster in Burma (Myanmar) killed many tens of thousands of people, and left some 1.5 million homeless, destitute, and vulnerable to secondary disasters from new floods, exposure, famine, and infectious diseases. The response from the military government has been alleged as criminally negligent, preventing foreign aid reaching the people in need. China was struck by a massive earthquake and series of aftershocks which killed an estimated more than 100,000 people and devastated many cities, towns, and villages. The governmental response was immediate and effective, accepting limited foreign assistance, which was unable to cope with the calamity, but limited the secondary effects of famine and infectious diseases.Hurricane Sandy in 2012 resulted in one of the largest disaster areas affecting the Caribbean and six states in the USA, including New York City. The damage in the USA included over 100 deaths, and an estimated US$50 billion of damage to property and public facilities. With power outages, the unsafe use of home generators and indoor use of charcoal grills resulted in fatal carbon monoxide poisonings.In August 2013, in a civil war in Syria with over 100,000 deaths and millions of refugees, a large-scale use of a neurotoxic chemical weapon (probably sarin) caused many hundreds of deaths and casualties. This caused international outrage and possible military response by the USA, the UK, and France. The intervention is legally based on the precedent of NATO\u2019s Kosovo intervention in the 1990s to prevent continued genocide and the Hague Convention on the use of chemical weapons in warfare (see Chapter 9).These experiences and threatened pandemics have brought public health organizations and key public health functions into the spotlight of national thinking in many countries, after many years of financial cutbacks and administrative neglect or outsourcing to private providers. This public awareness may be fleeting, and should be used to help strengthen public health infrastructure capacity and workforce development.Sources: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The responses of city, state, and federal authorities were impressive in their initial disaster management and provision of public information. FEMA played a vital supportive role, and continues to provide support in the reconstruction phase. But the first responders were local city employees of the police, fire, and ambulance services, who helped to coordinate health services, and evacuated patients from facilities threatened with flooding and fires, and the loss of electricity, food supplies, and other essentials. The public health impact is likely to be immense, from floodwaters as well as the potential for carbon monoxide poisoning from misuse of generators. Relief efforts by local, state, and national authorities to alleviate the immediate impact on millions of people will be followed by reconstruction that may take years and cost an estimated US$50 billion. Agencies involved in relief include the American Red Cross (http://www.redcross.org).

Among its functions are granting certificates of need, regulation of reimbursement methods for hospital care (see Chapter 13), establishing health standards and surveillance systems, rural health systems, and many other activities. This state DOH is active in screening programs for congenital and infectious diseases of the newborn, laboratory certification, and quality assurance. An AIDS Institute is responsible for prevention, screening, and AIDS care programs. The Center for Community Health operates a wide range of public health programs, from epidemiological surveillance of infectious diseases, to prenatal and newborn care among the underserved, to community health worker programs, to nutrition monitoring and many other intervention programs focused on high-risk groups or topics. Environmental epidemiology and monitoring are also strong in the state, which experienced the Love Canal incident (see Chapter 9). Figure 10.3\nshows the 1996 configuration of the New York State DOH.

The hospital bed-to-population ratio was 3.5 per 1000 population during the 1980s and 1990s. Payment by diagnosis-related group in the 1980s, and growing membership in managed care, led to reduced hospital bed occupancy, with 45 percent of beds occupied in 1996. In 1998, the vast majority of insured Angelinos belonged to managed care programs. As a result, many for-profit hospitals are being sold to for-profit hospital chains, or are under threat of closure, some being converted to long-term or ambulatory care facilities.As an example, the UCLA network includes the Santa Monica Hospital, a 337-bed acute care facility serving the health care needs of Los Angeles and Santa Monica since 1926. The UCLA network includes community clinics (Brentwood, Malibu, Santa Monica, Westwood, and others). This provides a wide population for the tertiary care center in competition with other tertiary care centers in Los Angeles. The UCLA Health Sciences Center is a teaching hospital owned and operated by the university.In the mid-1990s this center developed contracts to provide hospital care to many managed care programs. In order to broaden its community service base, the center purchased several community hospitals and established affiliation agreements with medical group practices in adjacent areas of the city. This enabled the center to ensure its catchment population in a highly competitive market. The emphasis is increasingly on developing contractual arrangements with primary care medical services. The Health Sciences Center is replacing the hospital owing to damage in the 1994 earthquake and will do so with a substantially lower number of beds. This is the survival strategy adopted to ensure its continuing role as a major teaching and community service hospital in the changing medical market in the twenty-first century.The UCLA Medical Center is also linked to many educational facilities including the Faculties of Medicine and Nursing, and the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health.Source: UCLA Health.

The trend to include hospitals in district health authorities, as in the Nordic countries, as part of geographic managed care programs is another important policy direction of health reform. Some Nordic countries, however, are reversing this trend and re-establishing centralized management of district hospitals.",
