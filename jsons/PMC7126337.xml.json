Pneumonia is the leading cause of sepsis in critically ill patients hospitalized in intensive care units (ICUs) [6]. The current guidelines for sepsis and septic shock management recommend empirical administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics at the initiation of therapy [7] and de-escalation to narrow-spectrum antibiotics if the patient responds [7,8]. Previous studies have attempted to show a relationship between antimicrobial de-escalation (ADE) and multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogen occurrence but have been unable to demonstrate consistent results [9,10].",

This team has resulted in the establishment of an RRT registry of septic patients. We retrospectively reviewed this registry from March 2008 to July 2018. Among the 2614 patients who met the registry criteria, we screened those who were diagnosed with sepsis or septic shock due to pneumonia requiring ICU admission regardless of the clinical setting (i.e., community-acquired or hospital-acquired). Subsequently, only patients with culture-negative pneumonia were included. Patients were excluded based on the following criteria: (i) cases in which the etiologic agents were identified between admission and ICU day 5; (ii) patients who died within 2 days of ICU admission; (iii) cases in which the patients were immunocompromised, such as those with hematologic malignancies, organ transplantation recipients, or receiving immune suppressants to treat connective tissue disease; (iv) patients with non-infectious causes, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or interstitial lung disease; and (v) or patients younger than 18 years. Only the first admission for each patient was included. The details were evaluated using the STROBE checklist [17].",

According to the guidelines, the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was calculated, and patient eligibility was evaluated. Pivotal antibiotics consisted of carbapenems, anti-pseudomonal antibiotics (\u03b2-lactam/\u03b2-lactamase inhibitor and 4th generation cephalosporin or ceftazidime), 3rd generation cephalosporins (excluding ceftazidime), glycopeptides, and aminopenicillins. Companion antibiotics consisted of fluoroquinolones, macrolides, and tetracyclines. We defined ADE as the discontinuation of pivotal or companion antibiotics or switching of pivotal antibiotics up to ICU day 5 as follows: carbapenems were replaced with another class of pivotal antibiotics, and anti-pseudomonal antibiotics were changed to those without an anti-pseudomonal effect [[19], [20], [21]]. We defined the antibiotic burden for the first 5 days as the product of the treatment duration and number of antibiotics. For patients who died or were transferred to the general ward within 5 days, the burden of antibiotics was calculated up to the day of death or transfer. ICU mortality was defined as death during treatment in the ICU or within one day after being transferred to a general ward for terminal care. In-hospital mortality was defined as death during the hospital stay. We categorized the cause of death as either pneumonia-related or pneumonia-unrelated.",

To the best of our knowledge, this study was the first to evaluate a relatively large number of patients with severe pneumonia whose microbiological identification tests, including multiplex-PCR and urinary antigen tests, could not positively identify a specific pathogen. We found no differences in ICU mortality or MDR pathogen emergence between the ADE and non-ADE patients. However, in-hospital mortality tended to be better in the ADE group.

Recently, the first randomized controlled trial on ADE revealed that the mortality rate did not differ between ADE and antimicrobial continuation groups of septic patients, including those with other causes, such as urinary tract or intra-abdominal infections. The primary outcome measurement was based on the patients. In that study's subgroup analysis of 56 patients with pneumonia, the ICU stays and superinfection episodes did not differ between the ADE and non-ADE groups [20]. Given that antibiotic streamlining should be determined by a combination of the microbiological culture results, infection source, patient's clinical course, and effective source control, we chose to focus on patients with culture-negative sepsis or septic shock due to pneumonia. In our study, we excluded patients with positive tests for viral pneumonia, since the mortality of viral pneumonia is not significantly different from that of bacterial pneumonia [27].",

The incidence of MDR pathogens in our study was 16.2%, which was comparable to that of other published studies [13,20,24]. The most common de-escalated antibiotics were glycopeptides, followed by carbapenems, which reflected the concern about the emergence of pathogens resistant to these classes of antibiotics. Notably, in a subgroup analysis, we found no correlation between carbapenem discontinuation and the emergence of CRAB or CRPA (Table S1 in the online supplement file). Carlier and colleagues reported that the probability of reaching the targeted pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of narrow-spectrum antibiotics was less than that of broad-spectrum agents [29]. Although a longer duration of therapy would contribute to an increased risk of MDR pathogen emergence, not reaching the PK or PD target could indicate that insufficient drug was administered to obtain a therapeutic response. In this light, patients who receive ADE may be more likely to have a longer duration of antimicrobial therapy and thus an increased incidence of MDR pathogens [20]. Although we did not evaluate the PK and PD of the antimicrobial agents, the duration of antibiotics did not differ between the ADE and non-ADE groups. Further studies with a large number of patients are warranted to evaluate the relationship between ADE and MDR pathogen emergence.",

Thus, the findings of the current study may not be applicable to all patients with culture-negative pneumonia. Additionally, although we conducted meticulous surveillance cultures and other diagnostic tests, patients with clinical deterioration due to non-infectious causes may have been included. Second, there is no consensus on the definition of ADE, which makes comparisons between studies using different or conflicting definitions difficult. Third, serial procalcitonin was checked in only 40.2% (43/107) of the patients. Thus, procalcitonin-guided antimicrobial stewardship could not be evaluated in our study. However, among the patients who had follow-up procalcitonin data, no association was found between procalcitonin and antimicrobial de-escalation (Table S2 in the online supplement file). Fourth, the information in the RRT registry consisted of patients with suspected sepsis who were already receiving antibiotic therapy. Fifth, since the study duration was 10 years, a time effect on the result might have occurred. However, when we performed the analysis in two groups according to the time periods, no significant difference was observed in the effect of ADE on ICU mortality (Tables S3\u201312 in the online supplement file). Lastly, the most important limitation of the current study was that no antimicrobial stewardship protocols existed during this timeframe. Absence of an antimicrobial protocol led to an excessive treatment duration in our subjects that strongly deviated from the current guidelines. In addition, no difference in mortality was found between those with \u22648 days and > 8 days of antibiotic use. Thus, although our study showed the safety of ADE for patients with culture-negative pneumonia, it also indicated the importance of early discontinuation of antibiotics in these patients.",
