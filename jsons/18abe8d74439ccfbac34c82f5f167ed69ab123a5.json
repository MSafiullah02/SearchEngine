[2] Currently, there is no approved treatment for diseases caused by coronaviruses and therefore there is a pressing need for the discovery and development of novel therapeutic agents for treatment of COVID-19 and other coronavirus infections. [3] Directly acting antiviral agents have revolutionized the treatment of numerous viral disease such as hepatitis B and C and AIDS [4, 5] and such a compound, remdesivir, was also very recently FDA approved for emergency treatment of COVID-19 patients.

In particular, the genome of SARS-CoV-2 has ~29 800 bases, which encodes four structural and sixteen nonstructural proteins (nsp1 -nsp16) that are essential for the replication of this virus. [6, 7] As all positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses (+RNA viruses), SARS-CoV-2 is able to take full advantage of the cell environment and use it for its replication. [8] Importantly, viral RNA must be protected from the cellular innate immunity. One of the most important elements that ensures the integrity of viral RNA is the cap, a specific arrangement at the 5 'end of the RNA molecule that consists of a N-methylated guanosine triphosphate and C2'-O-methylrybosyladenine (type 1 cap, Figure 1 ). This arrangement resembles the native mRNA of the host cells, stabilizes the RNA, and ensures effective process of its translation. In human cells, however, the cap is installed on newly transcribed mRNA already in the nucleus, to which coronaviruses do not have access. Instead, they possess their own cap-synthesizing enzymes. Clearly, this process is essential for the survival and further replication of viral RNA in cells. In principle, four different processes are necessary for installation of a type 1 cap on RNA (either human mRNA or coronavirus RNA). First, the \uf067-phosphate from a 5'-triphosphate end of the nascent RNA is removed by 5'-RNA triphosphatase. Second, a guanosine monophosphate (GMP) is attached to the formed 5'-diphosphate end of RNA by a guanylyltransferase using GTP as the source of GMP. Finally, the methylation steps take place. In this case, two separate enzymatic steps are required: one for N-7 methylation of the GTP nucleobase (N-7 methyltransferase) and the other for C2'-O methylation of the following nucleotide.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses use sequence installation of the cap that is performed by several nonstructural proteins (nsp) encoded by their genome. For coronaviruses, nsp10, 13, 14 and 16 proteins appear to be involved in this process. [9] The primary function of nsp13 protein is the unwinding of viral RNA during the replication. Therefore, it is considered to be essentially the helicase. However, it is also a protein with a 5'-RNA triphosphatase activity responsible for cleaving monohosphate at the 5'-end of the nascent RNA to provide a diphosphate. [10] There is still no clear evidence for any of the coronavirus proteins to possess the guanylyltransferase function associated with the cap creation. [9] Nsp14 and nsp16 are responsible for the methylation of the cap on the guanine of the GTP and the C2' hydroxyl group of the following nucleotide, respectively. Both nsp14 and nsp16 are S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferases (MTases) and seem to be essential for the viral life-cycle. [7] In particular, nsp16 appears to be a very promising molecular target from the perspective of medicinal chemistry and drug design. It has been shown that this 2'-O methyltransferase (MTase) is indispensable for replication of coronaviruses in cell cultures. [11, 12] Enzymatic activities of both these MTases (nsp14 and nsp16) are significantly enhanced by nsp10, which is a necessary cofactor for their proper function. [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] Here we report on the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 nsp10-nsp16 in complex with sinefungin, a pan-MTase inhibitor originally isolated from Streptomyces griseoleus. [17] The structure reveals an overall fold similar to SARS-CoV nsp10-nsp16, and, importantly, reveals atomic details in how sinefungin inhibits the nsp16 MTase. This provides the starting point for specific inhibitor design.",

The complex was stable during protein purification suggesting suitability for structural analysis. The nap10-nsp16 complex was supplemented with the pan-MTase inhibitor sinefungin and started crystallization trials. Eventually we obtained crystals that diffracted to 2.4\u00c5 resolution. The structure was solved by molecular replacement and revealed a mixed alpha-beta fold with sinefungin bound in a central canyon ( Figure 2) . A central feature of the nps16 MTase is a strip of parallel and anti-parallel \u03b2sheets (as they appear in the structure from the nsp10 interface: \u03b24, \u03b23, \u03b22, \u03b26, \u03b27, \u03b29, \u03b28, \u03b21) in the shape of the letter J which is stabilized from the inside by surrounding helices \u03b13 and \u03b14 and from the outside by helices \u03b15-\u03b19. Nsp10 could be divided in two subdomains a helical \u03b1-subdomain composed of helices \u03b11-\u03b14 and \u03b16 and a \u03b2-subdomain composed of two anti-parallel \u03b2-sheets (nsp10 \u03b21 and \u03b22), a short helix \u03b15 and several coiled-coil regions. A key feature of the nsp10 fold are two zinc binding sites. One is formed by three cysteine residues (Cys74, Cys77, Cys90) and a histidine residue (His83) and is located between the helices \u03b12 and \u03b13 and appears to stabilize them in the observed conformation. The other zinc binding site is formed by four cysteine residues (Cys117, Cys120, Cys128, Cys130) and stabilizes the very Cterminus of the nsp10 protein.

Two residues Val42 and Leu45 of nsp10 are immersed into hydrophobic pockets formed by helices \u03b13, \u03b14 and \u03b110 of nsp16 ( Figure 3F ). Nsp10 Val42 is anchored in a nsp16 hydrophobic pocked formed by residues Met41, Val44, Ala73, Val78, and Pro80. Similarly, Leu45 is anchored in a deep hydrophobic pocket formed by nsp16 residues Pro37, Ile40, Val44, Thr48, Leu244 and Met247. Further on, the main chain of the aforementioned nsp10 Leu45 also participates in two hydrogen bonds. The carbonyl group of Leu45 hydrogen bonds with Glu87 of nsp16 directly, while the amine group of the mainchain of Leu45 is connected with residue Thr48 of the nsp16 via water bridge mediated by hydrogen bonds (SI Figure 1) . Among other interactions, a positively charged Lys93 of nsp10 forms three hydrogen bonds with two water molecules (waters #54 and #170). They bridge nsp16 with further hydrogen bonds with the side chain of nsp10 Thr106 and the main chain carbonyl group of nsp10 Ala107 and amine group of Ser105 (SI Figure 1) .

Sinefungin is bound in the SAM binding pocket that is localized in a canyon within nsp16 (Figure 4 ). The nsp10 adjacent side is formed by ends of the parallel sheets \u03b22, \u03b23 and \u03b24 and helices \u03b15 and \u03b14. The opposite site of the ligand binding canyon is formed by the sheet \u03b26 and helices \u03b13 and \u03b16. The ligand binding site could also be divided into nucleoside and amino acid (methionine) binding pockets. The nucleoside forms hydrogen bonds with several residues including Asp99, Asn101 and Asp114 while the amino acid part is recognized by Asn43, Asp130 and Lys170 ( Figure 4B ). These six residues are absolutely conserved among SARS-CoV-2, SARS and MERS (SI Figure 2) highlighting the importance of RNA methylation for coronaviruses. We were also interested in the possible binding mode of the RNA substrate. We analyzed the electrostatic surface potential to reveal a putative RNA binding site. A positively charged canyon proximal to the SAM binding pocket could be easily spotted ( Figure 5A ). To figure out the orientation of RNA in the binding pocket we took advantage of the existing structure of human mRNA (nucleoside-2'-O-)-methyltransferase that was crystallized with a short piece of RNA (PDB code: 4N48). [18] This structure can be superposed with our structure (SI Figure 3 ) accurately enough to elucidate the RNA binding mode. The first nucleoside, 7N-methylated guanosine is bound in the upper part of the RNA binding canyon while the second nucleoside is positioned in the central part of the canyon in a way that its ribose ring gets in close proximity to the amino group of sinefungin, which in this case represents the methyl group to be transferred structurally explaining how nsp16 performs 2'-O methylation ( Figure 5) . We approximate -a real crystal structure is necessitated to obtain atomic details of the methylation reaction.",

The size of the RNA genome is limited by the (in)stability of the RNA, fidelity of the RdRps, its ability to correct excessive mutations and by the limited space for nucleic acid within the icosahedral capsid. Every viral enzyme is a potential drug target because RNA viruses do not have the luxury to encode non-essential accessory proteins. In this study, we have structurally analyzed SARS-CoV-2 2'-O-ribose methyltransferase, an essential enzyme involved in RNA cap formation which ensures stability of the viral RNA because non-methylated RNA located in cytoplasm is prone to degradation and cannot be efficiently translated. Our analysis revealed overall fold similarity between SARS and SARS-CoV-2 nsp10-nsp16 complexes (RMSD = 0.747) and also a high conservation of the SAM binding site among coronavirus, in fact, all the residues that are involved in ligand-hydrogen bonding are absolutely conserved between SARS, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS. The co-crystal structure we obtained is, however, not with the natural methyl donor, SAM, but with the pan-MTase inhibitor sinefungin.",

The mechanism of nsp16 activation is elusive because we do not have a structure of any unliganded coronaviral nsp16 protein. Structural analysis of the SARS-CoV nsp10 protein in an unliganded form and in complex with nsp16 reveals no significant conformational change of the nsp10 upon nsp16 binding. [19] Therefore, it is expected that nsp10 induces a conformational change in the nsp16 MTase that switches nsp16 in a productive enzyme. In principle, the nsp10-nsp16 interface is a drug target. However, given the large area of this interface and complex network of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions it is unlikely that it could be targeted by a small drug-like molecule.",

Nsp10 -nsp16 complex must be able to bind the previously introduced methylated GTP, and recognize at least the first Figure 5 : RNA recognition. The surface of the nsp10-nsp16 was colored according to electrostatic surface potential. Sinefungin is localized to the SAM binding pocket. The RNA binding pocket is characterized by a positively charged surface that interacts with the RNA phosphate backbone. The RNA cap is located at the top of the RNA binding pocket while the active site is located at the interface of the RNA and SAM binding pockets. nucleotide of the RNA strand, as well as the substrate for the methylation reaction, SAM. Based on the position of sinefungin in our structure, it is apparent where both of these two reaction partners bind to nsp16. These two binding sites form well-defined canyons in the structure of nsp16 as seen in Figure 5 . The binding site for sinefungin must be in direct contact with the 2\u2032-hydroxy group on the first nucleotide following the introductory methylated GTP moiety. In particular, the chiral amino at C6' of sinefungin has to be directed towards the RNA cap binding site. Therefore, modifications on this part of the molecule, based on a rational structural-based design, has led to the preparation of highly active inhibitors of various methyltransferases as shown previously on various sinefungin-related derivatives. [20] Also detailed knowledge of the amino acid moiety on the sinefungin binding site is extremely important for design of potential SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics, since the possible design of specific bioisosteres of the amino acid scaffold may play a vital role in the development of novel cell permeable compounds as potential inhibitors of this essential MTase.",

We performed a structural alignment of the SARS-CoV-2 MTase and the ZIKV MTase ( Figure 6 ). [21] The structural comparison illustrates that development of an MTase inhibitor active against both corona-and flaviviruses is highly unlikely unless it would be a promiscuous inhibitor closely resembling the substrate such as sinefungin. However, two residue pairs are conserved among corona-and flaviviruses: i) the Zika Asp114 and CoV-2 Asp131 that make a hydrogen bond with the adenine base which is essential for its recognition and ii) Zika Asp130 and CoV-2 Asp146 that are close to the methylation reaction center and important for catalysis. Also, this shows that there is a significant lipophilic cavity in close proximity to the adenine nucleobase of sinefungin in both SARS-CoV-2 and ZIKV MTase. In the case of flavivirus MTases, it has been shown, that this part of the enzyme can be effectively targeted by MTase inhibitors without affecting human proteins. Therefore, we believe, that this part of the nsp16 protein may play a very important role in future design of novel COVID-19 therapeutics.",
