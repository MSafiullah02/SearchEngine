            "text": "The current outbreak of the novel coronavirus 2019\u2010nCoV, which was first reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan on 31 December 2019, can cause serious pneumonia and is now known to spread from person to person. From 24 January 2020, hundreds of millions of people will travel to their hometowns or overseas for the Chinese New Year holidays, which is China's most significant annual holiday. Authorities in China and around the world have mounted an enormous operation to track and screen travelers from Wuhan in central China, where the first cases were documented. As of 26 January 2020, there have been 2744 cases of 2019\u2010nCoV confirmed in mainland China, including 80 deaths, 461 serious, and 51 discharged, as well as 8 in Hong Kong, 5 in Macao, and 4 in Taiwan. Thirty\u2010three exported cases to other countries have been confirmed, including seven in Thailand, three in Japan, three in South Korea, three in the United States, two in Vietnam, four in Singapore, three in Malaysia, one in Nepal, three in France, and four in Australia. Of note, the 2019\u2010nCoV disease has not been found in humans previously; therefore, determining how 2019\u2010nCoV spreads is the most urgent question surrounding the outbreak. It is also imperative that we discover whether 2019\u2010nCoV has the potential to cause an outbreak similar to the 2002\u20102003 outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV),\n1\n, \n2\n, \n3\n which emerged in southern China and eventually killed 774 people in 37 countries. 2019\u2010nCoV and SARS\u2010CoV are members of the large family of coronaviruses, which also includes the viruses responsible for the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).\n4\n, \n5\n Field studies have revealed the original source of SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV to be the bat,\n6\n, \n7\n, \n8\n, \n9\n with masked palm civets (a mammal native to Asia and Africa)\n10\n, \n11\n, \n12\n and camels,\n13\n, \n14\n respectively, serving as intermediate hosts between bats and humans. To date, 2019\u2010nCoV is most closely associated with SARS and related viruses that circulate in bats.\n15\n The hypothesis that 2019\u2010nCoV jumped from an animal at the Wuhan Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which sold processed meats and live consumable animals, is strongly supported by previous study suggesting that this virus came directly or indirectly from bats.\n15\n Therefore, the 2019\u2010nCoV outbreak implies that the human consumption of wild animals should be limited to prevent zoonotic disease infection.",

This strain was the first released 2019\u2010nCoV genome sequence but has since been updated three times. In this study, we used the latest version (MN908947.3), and therefore the genome sequence of strain BetaCoV/Wuhan\u2010Hu\u20101/2019 from GISAID (EPI_ISL_402125) was excluded. Isolate BetaCoV/Wuhan/IVDC\u2010HB\u201004/2020 (EPI_ISL_402120) shows evidence of sequencing artifacts and thus was also excluded in this study. The final dataset included 12 genome sequences of 2019\u2010nCoV with known sampling date and city (10 from individuals in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, with samples collected between 24 and 30 December 2019, and two from Chinese individuals in Bangkok, Thailand, who had recently traveled from Wuhan, with samples collected between 8 and 13 January 2020) (Table S1).

For each sequence quartet, three unrooted tree topologies are possible. For a random sample of quartets, the likelihoods for the three possible topologies are reported as dots in an equilateral triangle. The distribution of points in different sections of this triangle indicates the tree\u2010likeness of the data: the three corners represent fully resolved tree topologies, indicating the presence of a tree\u2010like phylogenetic signal; the center represents the sets of points where all three trees are equally supported, indicating a star\u2010like phylogenetic signal; and the three areas on the sides indicate support for conflicting tree topologies. To infer phylogeny, we used the maximum\u2010likelihood approach with the Hasegawa\u2010Kishino\u2010Yano nucleotide substitution model with gamma\u2010distributed rate variation among sites (HKY+G) in PhyML v3.1.\n20\n Support for the inferred relationships was determined by bootstrap analysis with 1000 replicates. To reconstruct the evolutionary history of 2019\u2010nCoV, we used Bayesian inference through a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework implemented in BEAST v1.8.4,\n21\n with the BEAGLE library v2.1.2\n22\n used to increase computational performance. As no temporal signal was present in the dataset, we employed HKY+G, as well as a constant size coalescent tree prior and strict molecular clock model assuming an evolutionary rate of 4.59 \u00d7 10\u22124 substitutions per site per year to estimate the time to most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) for this dataset based on previous genetic analysis.\n23\n We also placed a log\u2010normal prior (mean = 4.59 \u00d7 10\u22124 substitutions per site per year, 95% Bayesian credible interval: 1.178 \u00d7 10\u22124 to 3 \u00d7 10\u22123 substitutions per site per year) on the evolutionary rate with a strict molecular clock model based on previous studies.\n24\n, \n25\n, \n26\n To ensure adequate mixing of model parameters, MCMC chains were run for 100 million steps with sampling every 10 000 steps from the posterior distribution.

On the basis of the confirmation from Professor Zhong, who is leading the government's expert panel on the outbreak, 14 healthcare workers appear to have been infected by one person who carried the virus. This suggests that epidemic super\u2010spreaders may have been generated at the very beginning of the outbreak and occurred once this novel coronavirus jumped from animals to humans. In addition, as mass travel for the Chinese New Year holiday could spread this virus farther and faster, it is critical to understand the Wuhan 2019\u2010nCOV outbreak and predict how easily the virus can transmit between humans and whether the outbreak has the potential to persist. On the basis of our time scale phylogenetic analysis of 12 genome sequences, the observed lack or limited diversity of the 2019\u2010nCOV strains suggests that the common ancestor of this virus in humans possibly occurred on 9 November 2019.",
