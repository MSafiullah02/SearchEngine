Chlamydia pneumoniae was identified as another cause of atypical pneumonia [18]. The importance of atypical and other viral causes of CAP in adults (ie, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza, hantavirus, metapneumonia virus, coronavirus [severe acute respiratory syndrome]) have been identified by various investigators, including those at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and World Health Organization [19], [20], [21], [22], [23].",

Approximately one third of patients had taken at least one dose of antibiotics before presenting to the physician. The services of many microbiology laboratories have been scaled back because of hospital budgetary constraints. The consolidation of many hospitals has led to the use of centralized or reference laboratories, which prolongs the time from specimen collection to processing. These factors have decreased the ability to culture pyogenic organisms, such as S pneumoniae. Centers that use methods in addition to culture for S pneumoniae (antigen detection, serological means) have reported finding more cases of pneumococcal pneumonia than cases of pneumonia caused by unidentified pathogens, suggesting that many patients without a definable cause have pneumococcal pneumonia [10], [16].",

There is some debate as to the value of culturing S pneumoniae from expectorated sputum even with a compatible gram stain, although clinicians with experience in pneumococcal pneumonia value the information provided by high-quality pulmonary secretions [35]. A rapid S pneumoniae urinary antigen has been evaluated [36], [37] and shown to have good specificity in the adult population (>95% in most studies) and reasonable sensitivity (70%\u201380% in most studies). The test was too sensitive in heavily colonized children and could not discriminate among infected or colonized children in underdeveloped countries [38]. A study from Spain studied 452 patients who were hospitalized with acute CAP in whom a S pneumoniae urinary antigen (SpUA) test was performed [39]. Pneumococci were found in cultures from only 27 patients (7%; half from blood, half from sputum). The SpUA test was positive in 19 of 27 patients with positive cultures (70%); however, an additional 85 patients had positive SpUA tests with cultures that were negative for pneumococcus. Because the specificity has been reported to be greater than 95% in adults, most of these patients also had pneumococcal pneumonia. In this study, 112 of 452 patients (25%) would have pneumococcal pneumonia, a proportion of pneumococcal pneumonia cases that is similar to the proportion in other large series of hospitalized cases of CAP. The sensitivity of the SpUA test would be 104 of 112 patients (93%) or at least would be four times greater than the combination of cultures of sputum and blood (27 of 112 patients [24%]). Cultures still would be important in determining antimicrobial susceptibility.",

Mufson and Stanek [5] reported on 423 patients with pneumococcal bacteremia in Huntington, West Virginia over 20 years. The data were analyzed in 5-year periods. Overall, the incidence of pneumococcall bacteremia increased, and the CFR decreased. In each 5-year period, a regimen including a macrolide and \u03b2-lactam resulted in lower CFR than did regimens involving a \u03b2-lactam alone or two antibiotics (excluding macrolides). No specifics were provided on the timing of the initial dose and changes in therapy. Fluoroquinolones were used infrequently. Although this study was retrospective and did not control for severity of illness, it may have offered the first clue that monotherapy of pneumococcal bacteremia with a cephalosporin is less efficacious than combination therapy with a cephalosporin and a macrolide.",

Patients received one antibiotic active against the patient's isolate (single effective therapy [SET]), two effective antibiotics (dual effective therapy [DET]), or more than two effective antibiotics (MET). Logistic regression analysis was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) for death adjusted for predicted mortality. Compared with DET, the OR for SET was 6.4 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.9\u201321.7). All deaths occurred in cases with pneumonia severity index (PSI) classes IV and V. Even after excluding deaths that occurred in first 48 hours of hospitalization, SET was an independent predictor of death (OR, 4.9; 95%CI 1.6\u201318.3). Analysis was done to evaluate coverage for atypical pathogens. The CFR was 9.9% (17 of 172 patients) in patients receiving atypical coverage and was 22.6% (12 of 53) in patients not receiving atypical coverage; however, the predicted mortality rate was higher in the latter group of patients. Multivariate analysis did not show that lack of atypical coverage was a predictor of death (P\n = 0.17). The investigators suggest that prospective studies should address SET versus DET in patients with pneumococcal bacteremia in PSI classes IV and V.

Of 409 patients analyzed, 238 (58%) received empiric therapy with a \u03b2-lactam plus a macrolide, whereas 171 (42%) received empiric therapy with a \u03b2-lactam alone. Potential risk factors for in-hospital death were identified in stepwise logistic regression analysis. Multivariate analysis revealed that absence of a macrolide in the initial empiric regimen independently was associated with death (P\n = 0.03). Other independent predictors of death included shock, age greater than 64 years, and a blood culture isolate of an S pneumoniae strain resistant to penicillin and erythromycin. A total of 35 patients (9%) died. Even when the data were reanalyzed to exclude 10 early deaths (occurred <48 hours after presentation), the absence of a macrolide in initial therapy was associated with death (OR, .4; 95%CI, 0.09\u20130.9). In this study, a macrolide could be combined favorably with a cephalosporin or a \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor. A previous study of patients with CAP, but not nonbacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia, found that treated with \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors and a macrolide were less effective than treatment with a cephalosporin alone [32]. As with most retrospective studies, there were differences among the popuations. The group receiving cephalosporin alone had higher incidences of comorbid conditions, HIV infection, hematologic malignancies, neutropenia, nosocomial bacteremia, and penicillin-resistant isolates. In the group receiving \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors and a macrolide, more patients experienced shock and resultant admission to ICU. The investigators caution that a prospective, randomized trial is necessary to definitively determine the effect of macrolides.",

There is evidence that the combination of penicillin and tetracycline have antagonistic effects in patients with pneumococcal meningitis [43]. One possible explanation for the decreased mortality rate with combination therapy could be that the macrolide is somewhat antagonistic against the rapid killing of the pneumococci by the cephalosporin. This effect could slow the rapid lysis of pneumococci and abate the resultant intense inflammatory response. Would the use of two empiric antibiotics make it more likely that at least one would be active against the pneumococcus? In their study, Waterer et al [6] excluded organisms resistant to empiric therapy and still demonstrated a benefit of macrolide use. Lujan et al [44] demonstrated that discordant therapy was associated with a higher CFR. This finding was seen only among physicians who did not use third-generation cephalosporins.

All of the patients received ceftriaxone. The type of macrolide therapy was chosen by the attending physician. The choices were 500 mg of oral azithromycin daily for 3 days (n = 383) or 500 mg of intravenous clarithromycin twice daily with a switch to oral treatment (total duration of treatment, 10 days; n = 220). The patients had similar ages, comorbidities, and PSIs. The length of stay (LOS) for the azithromycin group was 2 days shorter (P < 0.01). The CFR was 3.6% in the azithromycin group and 7.2% in the clarithromycin group (P < 0.05). There was no obvious reason for the differences in the two treatment arms. The investigators suggested that compliance might have been an issue, because patients in the azithromycin arm received their 3-day course in the hospital, whereas many patients in the clarithromycin arm had to complete their course at home. Other possibilities include differences in the anti-inflammatory attributes of the two drugs and the presence of an unknown pathogen that is susceptible to azithromycin and resistant to clarithromycin. Because this analysis was retrospective analysis, there may have been undiscovered biases.",

Caution about overinterpreting retrospective studies has been published [63], [64], [65]. Investigations into the inflammatory response in patients with severe pneumococcal pneumonia should incorporate recent advances in murine studies [66], [67], [68], [69], [70], [71], [72], [73]. Prospective studies aimed at testing the available hypotheses need to be developed. The S pneumoniae urinary antigen will be helpful in defining the subset of patients who should be studied intensively. Tests are needed that assess the inflammatory response, resolution of illness (ie, rapidity in reduction of the magnitude of bacteremia), and importance of alternative pathogens (M pneumoniae, C pneumoniae, L pneumophila, other Legionella spp and viruses). Other variables that should be taken into account include the specific macrolide used and the effect of other classes of antimicrobial agents, such as fluoroquinolones. Ideally, the study would include provisions for autopsies or postmortem pulmonary biopsies in fatal cases.",
