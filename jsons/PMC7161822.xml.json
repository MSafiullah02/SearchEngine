Glycan biosynthesis is not template\u2010driven and cannot be accurately predicted by any known method. In addition, glycans form branched structures, display numerous modifications, and have far more diversity in overall structure. These and other differences partly account for the historical lag in chemical and biological studies of glycans, compared to the other classes of biopolymers. The development of technologies to elucidate the structures and functions of these complex molecules have recently drawn increasing scientific interest and it is now well appreciated that glycans play vital roles in numerous complex biological processes and systems,3, 4 a fact recently recognized by a special report from the US National Academies, urging greater investments in this area.5\n",

Gagneux). Viewed in this manner, one can appreciate the importance of considering the glycome as a whole when studying glycan\u2010based interactions. Such clustered saccharide patches are proposed to involve multiple glycan components and their surroundings. Thus multiple copies of the same glycan or multiple copies of different glycans, or glycans and nonglycan structures including adjacent sulfates or peptide sequences on the same scaffold/carrier or on different ones, can participate to make up clustered saccharide patches.

The Sia epitopes cluster with other components in the microdomains and together they mediate cell adhesion and signaling to influence the cellular phenotypes.89 Sia\u2010containing clustered saccharide patches on RBCs of different blood types can also explain the differential binding of Sia\u2010recognizing proteins in relation to ABO blood group polymorphisms in humans.90 Furthermore, evidence for Siglec or Ab recognition of bacterial capsular polysaccharides exists, indicating the presence of Sia\u2010containing clustered saccharide patches on pathogens.91, 92\n",

Among various chemical and chemoenzymatic methods developed for the synthesis of sialoglycans bearing natural and unnatural Sias, the one\u2010pot multienzyme (OPME) chemoenzymatic sialylation method116 is the most efficient for generating libraries of sialosides102 that can be used for sialoglycan microarray studies.

These can then be used as substrates, by a CMP\u2010Sia synthetase and a suitable sialyltransferase in the absence or the presence of a Sia aldolase, for the synthesis of desired sialoglycans. Diverse sialosides can be synthesized due to unusual promiscuities of sialyltransferases and other related sialoside biosynthetic enzymes, including Sia aldolases and CMP\u2010Sia synthetases, toward substrate modifications.

Nevertheless, sialoglycan microarrays comprised of \u223c50\u201390 of these structures have been readily produced and applied in various studies.138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143 During the past few years, Paulson's group has been developing chemical and chemoenzymatic methods to create a large library of sialoside analogues (Table 1).144, 145, 146 In 2008, Blixt et al.144 utilized 9\u2010azido\u2010Neu5Ac intermediates and synthesized a library of 44 sialoside analogues bearing un\u2010natural acyl substituents at the C\u20109 position, among which 16 were \u03b12\u20103\u2010linked and 28 \u03b12\u20106\u2010linked. In 2012, Rillahan et al. took advantage of click chemistry and further developed the idea of using a minimum quantity of synthetic sialoglycan analogues on microarrays to screen for high affinity Siglec\u2010binding ligands.145 This time, a considerably larger library was generated thanks to the facile copper catalyzed azide\u2010alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) chemistry. Besides modifications at the C\u20109 position, C\u20105 modified Sias were also produced. In total, 224 Sia\u2010analogues with either \u03b12\u20103 or \u03b12\u20106 linkages, and with lactose as underlying glycan, were produced. It is noteworthy that these compounds were printed on glycan microarrays for screening without column purifications, resulting in higher throughput than the previous effort.144 However, most of the Sias on these arrays are unnatural ones. Another sialoglycan library comes from the Feizi group, which consists of more than 700 naturally derived and then chemically tagged neoglycolipids.147 Among these, there are about 120 sialoglycans with different Sia forms and linkages, and underlying glycans (Table 1).148, 149, 150, 151 This library of sialoglycans differs from most others by the nature of glycan source, that is, they are derived from natural sources instead of chemically built as in most other cases. It also contains a few \u03b12\u20109 linked Sias that other major sialoglycan libraries lack.150 Our own labs have been studying the diversity and biology of naturally occurring Sias and are especially interested in the chemistry and biology of the nonhuman Sia molecule, Neu5Gc, as well as various Sia O\u2010acetylations (c.f., sections and relevant references above, and additional Refs. \n30, 78, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156). A library of over 70 synthetic sialoglycans was thus produced, which is unique in that it contains various pairs of Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc counterparts bearing the same glycosidic linkages, underlying glycans and spacers, that is, matched structures differing only by a single oxygen atom. Moreover, many pairs were further diversified by 9\u2010O\u2010acetylation on the core Sia structures (Table 1).46, 157, 158, 159, 160 This library is thus well suited for comparing protein recognition properties between Neu5Ac\u2010 and Neu5Gc\u2010containing glycans, as well as for exploring the effects of Sia O\u2010acetylation on binding. Furthermore, the number of sialoglycans in this library is actively increasing. The Cummings and Smith group also prepared a sialoglycan library in collaboration with one of us. The library has 77 sialoglycans with 16 different Sia modifications based on three core Sia structures (Neu5Ac, Neu5Gc, and Kdn), either \u03b12\u20103 or \u03b12\u20106 linked, and four different underlying glycan structures (Table 1).158, 161, 162 Among the 16 modified Sias, 13 are naturally occurring and three have not yet been found in nature. This sialoglycan library expanded the Sia diversity formerly covered in glycan microarray systems by adding the methylated and lactylated Sia structures. The Bovin lab and Wong lab have two other libraries of sialoglycans, containing about 40 and 30 different structures, respectively. Both are synthetically produced, and most of them are Neu5Ac\u2010bearing structures (Table 1).163, 164, 165, 166 Besides monovalent sialoglycans, the Bovin lab also produced sialoglycans on PAA polymer backbones and with additional functionalities such as biotin or fluorescein labels. The Institute for Glycomics in Griffiths University also has a library of \u223c20 sialoglycans.167\n",

In the case of sialoglycan microarrays, only three immobilization methods are widely used and applied for various studies (Table 1). These are chemistries involving reactions of an amine with NHS\u2010ester, or with epoxide, and noncovalent hydrophobic attachment.

In 2008, the Cheng group in collaboration with one of us reported a sialoglycan biosensor platform based on surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy, to study Sia\u2010lectin interactions in a label\u2010free format and in real\u2010time.170 The biotin\u2010neutravidin interaction was used to immobilize four biotinylated Sias, Neu5Ac\u03b12\u20103Lac, Kdn\u03b12\u20103Lac, Neu5Ac\u03b12\u20106Lac, and Kdn\u03b12\u20106Lac on the sensor chip and the system was interrogated with a number of lectins. Interaction kinetics and affinity data were obtained, and the effects of Sia structure and linkage variations on lectin binding proved to be detectable by the system. In 2009, a follow\u2010up SPR imaging study was carried out for more detailed characterizations of the sensor surface chemistry and lectin interactions with additional techniques including fluorescence microscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM).171 In 2011, the Flitsch group presented a platform to generate sialoglycans in situ on surfaces in an array format and the synthesis was monitored by MALDI\u2010TOF (matrix\u2010assisted laser desorption ionization time\u2010of\u2010flight) mass spectrometry (MS). After completion of the in situ chemoenzymatic reactions, the sialoglycan surfaces were directly used for studying interactions by cells bearing recombinant Siglecs.172 The authors demonstrated that a self\u2010assembled monolayer (SAM) surface was suitable for studying whole mammalian cell interactions with limited nonspecific interactions. Combination of glycan microarray and MALDI\u2010TOF techniques was also exploited to assess enzymatic activities and specificities of influenza neuraminidases from whole viruses.173 However, this study used different surfaces and immobilization chemistry. Their sialoglycan array took advantage of a DNA/DNA hybridization method and glass slides bearing microreactors were produced to anchor the surface DNA strand. In 2012, the Sun group reported two interesting developments involving sialoglycan microarrays.174, 175 In one case, two Neu5Ac\u2010containing glycopolymers were chemoenzymatically synthesized. The Sias were \u03b12\u20103\u2010 or \u03b12\u20106\u2010linked to underlying lactose, and the polymer scaffold was functionalized with an O\u2010cyanate group at the chain\u2010end for surface immobilization. The oligo\u2010Sia macroligands were immobilized to amine\u2010functionalized glass slides via amine\u2010O\u2010cyanate chemistry, leading to an oriented presentation of the Sia\u2010bearing polymer.174 The system was interrogated by a range of lectins, in the presence or absence of free Sia competitors. An SPR biosensor system was also developed based on the same immobilization chemistry to study lectin and influenza hemagglutinin (HA) binding to the attached sialoglycan polymers. The authors claim this system better mimics the 3D nature of cell surface Sia presentation and should provide considerable advantages for relevant studies. In the other study, Ma et al.175 fabricated a liposomal sialoglycan microarray by the Staudinger ligation method. Gangliosides GM1 and GM3 inserted liposomes were immobilized on glass slides and remained intact, after which lectin and bacterial toxin bindings were evaluated. This system was claimed to present sialoglycans on a surface mimicking native cell membranes, and could thus be deemed an important tool for various applications.",

In part due to a joint effort between the CFG and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and partly because of the global public health concern/high importance of the topic, the proteins from influenza viruses of various origins, subtypes, clades, and strains have been extensively studied by sialoglycan microarrays.

Receptor specificities of human, avian, and porcine influenza viruses have been examined and comparisons among these strains have yielded insights into the molecular basis for their receptor specificity, transmissibility, as well as virulence.139, 141, 148, 161, 165, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198 In most of these studies, intact or biotinylated viruses were applied to the sialoglycan microarrays and detected by fluorochrome\u2010labeled virus\u2010binding Abs or streptavidin\u2010fluorochromes, respectively.

Unexpectedly, the printed glycan microarrays with oligomannose structures showed no increase in bacterial binding capacity compared to mono\u2010mannose arrays.204 The authors attributed this phenomenon to the possibility that the tested bacterial stain only required a single mannose residue for recognition and the multivalency of mannose and stereochemistry of the intermannose linkages played little role. However, a more recent study from the same group showed that trimannose and nonamannose structures attached to a cantilever array sensor tip did show differential binding affinities to the same E. coli strain tested earlier, indicating an increased multisite and multivalent binding for the nonamannose structure compared to less complex mannose structures.205 Taken together, these studies showed a need to improve the glycan microarray platform for studying intact bacteria. In this regard we have recently embarked on using sialoglycan microarrays to investigate a group of Gram\u2010positive bacteria (Deng and Varki, et al., unpublished observations).

            "text": "In 2010, Wu and coworkers210 published a glycan microarray design of such a nature. They spotted the glass slides with mixed glycans, for example, SSEA4/Gb5, Globo H/Gb5, Gb4/Gb5, Gb3/Gb5, Gb2/Gb5, Bb2/Gb5, in 1:1 molar ratio and interrogated the slides with anti\u2010Gb5 Ab. Interestingly, the SSEA4/Gb5 mixed glycan spot consistently showed higher binding than the Gb5\u2010alone glycan spot. On the other hand, neighboring glycans could also exert a negative effect on the Gb5 and anti\u2010Gb5 interaction, possibly via steric hindrance, as evidenced by lower binding of the other mixed glycan spots compared to the Gb5\u2010alone spot. Further tests were done by mixing glycans in varied concentrations and by using synthetic oligomannose dendrimers containing different ratios of Man4 and Man9 structures. Both experiments demonstrated Ab binding could be affected by the density and structures of neighboring glycans. In parallel, the Willison lab combined a few techniques and recently produced polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PVDM) affixed glass slides for the generation of sialoglycan (ganglioside) microarrays. They called this setup a \u201ccombinatorial glycoarray,\u201d and used it primarily to study neuropathy\u2010associated anti\u2010glycolipid autoantibodies.211, 212 These Abs specifically recognize complexes of glycolipid pairs, but fail to interact with either of the glycolipids alone. Other exciting developments include that relatively stable lipid bilayer coated glycan microarray slides have been readily made. This is promising due to its better mimicry of the cell surface features.213, 214 It can be envisaged that this type of surface may serve as an ideal platform for decoding the effects of clustered saccharide patches on protein and cell bindings.",

However, the immobilization chemistries used for attaching the sialoglycans on the two platforms were different, and the linkage monosaccharide ring was opened in one of the two arrays. These microarrays were reciprocally tested against various Sia\u2010binding proteins and analyzed in the two labs.158 This comparison yielded a lot of useful information but also identified major challenges in the standardization of glycan microarray experiments. For instance, immobilization methods appeared to strongly influence some binding results. Also, the close\u2010ring immobilization method was evidently critical for some glycan\u2010recognition events, and an open\u2010ring immobilization could sometimes lead to the absence of detectable binding. This is in keeping with another intragroup comparison of glycan microarrays differing only in the immobilization method, where it was found that the ring\u2010closed immobilization method was critical for many glycan\u2010recognition events.217 Lower signal\u2010to\u2010noise ratio bindings based on open\u2010ring immobilization method was also observed in another independent array comparison study.162 Besides these, binding data with various glycans from the same source but arrayed at different locations were also compared and reported.218 More recently, a larger scale glycan microarray comparison involving five different research groups has been carried out (personal communication from Dr. Lara K. Mahal, NYU).",

            "text": "The diversity and biology of Sias represent part of the vast information and knowledge gained in the field of glycosciences. It is evident that sialoglycan microarrays are playing an increasingly important role in elucidating this diversity and biology. During the past decade, the advancement of glycan microarray development and applications is indeed highly laudable and exemplary; however, there is still plenty of room for further developments and improvements.\nLarger libraries of sialoglycans, consisting of either natural structures or synthetic analogues, are still greatly desired. Just by comparing currently available sialoglycan libraries and the diversity of Sia structures occurring in nature12 one can realize how big the gap is, let alone the unlimited possibilities of synthetic Sia analogues. For example, it will be interesting to see sialoglycan microarrays made of 4\u2010O\u2010acetylated Sias or polySias. These structures are largely un\u2010explored by sialoglycan microarrays. In addition, current efforts are mainly focused on elucidating binding of terminal glycan sequences. However, binding effects resulting from intact natural sialoglycan classes and underlying peptides/lipids have to be further evaluated.Sialoglycan microarrays have shown to be a suitable platform to demonstrate the concept of clustered saccharide patches. Further studies such as mixing more components in a single glycan spot, controlling spacing between glycans in the spot, and testing their effects on protein binding, are worthwhile.Ligand specificity of many more Sia\u2010recognizing proteins, viruses, bacteria and whole mammalian cells are worthy of investigation in detail.98, 99, 100, 101, 102 This would require more extensive collaborations between glycoscientists (chemists and biologists) and researchers from other fields, such as microbiologists. The joint effort will certainly benefit all parties involved.To date, more than 20 different types of immobilization methods for glycan microarray fabrication have been developed.134, 135 For example, the immobilization of glycans by photochemistry is a highly versatile and efficient method.219 This can be realized by producing photoprobe\u2010derivatized glycans,220 direct attachment of underivatized glycans,221 or a \u201cphoto\u2010click\u201d hybrid method.222 Photogenerated glycan microarrays have also been successfully applied to identify immunogenic glycan antigens specific to certain bacterium.223 However, most of the immobilization methods developed to date were only demonstrated in proof\u2010of\u2010concept type of studies. The exceptional versatility and efficiency of the photochemical immobilization methods warrant further development and broader applications. Cross\u2010comparison of these immobilization methods and insight into their merits and disadvantages are needed for further microarray standardization and applications.Technical issues such as Sia contamination of the most widely used glycan microarray blocking reagent bovine serum albumin (BSA) (our observations, unpublished result), and sample dilution effects,224 and so forth, are also important considerations in conducting glycan microarray experiments and analyzing glycan microarray data.Initial efforts have been undertaken, but the cross\u2010comparison and standardization of sialoglycan microarray experiments and microarray data processing has a long way to go. Guiding rules for the interpretation of glycan microarray data are also to be established. Moreover, building common glycan microarray databases and further enabling relevant glycobioinformatics would be very helpful and beneficial to the entire glycoscience community.225\nCombination of glycan microarrays with other methods and techniques will, on the one hand, help validate the glycan microarray data, and on the other hand, often add another dimension to the findings. For example, real\u2010time monitoring of the binding events and additional binding kinetics data can be obtained with biosensors like SPR220, 221 and quartz crystal microbalance (QCM).222, 226 Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) can provide thermodynamic information,227 and detailed single molecular interaction data can be acquired by using AFM.228 Combination of microarrays with nanotechnology can greatly enhance the sensitivity of detection.229, 230 Furthermore, comparisons with other assays like enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and dot blots,231, 232 and combination with MS, computational modeling, X\u2010ray crystallography, etc., have been and will continue to play major roles in the elucidation of glycan\u2013protein interactions.After glycan microarray screening of glycan\u2013protein interactions and complementary methods to validate the bindings, follow\u2010up biomedical and/or biological studies are critical. These will ultimately move the initial findings into more clinically and/or biologically relevant and more profound discoveries/applications to combat diseases and benefit human health.This review focused on studies of Sia diversity and biology by using sialoglycan microarrays, but the concepts, trends, and ideas discussed in this incomplete survey are readily applicable to other types of glycans and glycan microarrays.\n",
