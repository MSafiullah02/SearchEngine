[6] fit a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) metapopulation infection model to reported cases in Wuhan and major cities connected by air traffic. In [8] , an SEIR model has been estimated by including surface traffic from location-based services data of Tencent. However, neither the air traffic to international destinations nor the aggregated people throughput to Wuhan can help establish the transmission model among populous China cities connected to Wuhan mainly via surface traffic. Significantly, the reported cases in those populations connected to Wuhan are important to help robust estimation of the transmission potential of the virus. This is particularly important in the initial stage of the outbreak, as the initial reports can be prone to various disturbances, such as to delay or misdiagnosis, which is identified in our robust analysis below.",

We propose to employ the random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm [3] to achieve robust parameter estimation. SEIR and most infection models of contagious diseases are designed for review analysis [2] . On the other hand, to provide a useful forecast in the outbreaking stage of a new disease, transmission models must be established using data that are insufficient in terms of both quantity and quality. The maximum likelihood model estimation used by most existing studies is sensitive to outliers. Therefore, the estimated parameters can be unreliable due to the quality of the data in the initial stage of an epidemic. The issue is rooted in the combination of the quality of the data and sensitivity of the fitting method, therefore it is not easily addressed/captured by traditional sensitivity analysis techniques such as bootstrapping.",

Theoretically, the inference optimisation in (5) can be established by using any observation model. However, in practice, to estimate the transmission characteristics of a contagious disease during the out-breaking stage, the empirical observations are usually limited to the sporadic report of confirmed infection cases, as the exposed latent subjects are unable to identify and waiting for recovery cases is not a viable option for nowcasting and forecasting study.",

As a new disease starts spreading, the first cases can be misdiagnosed, especially when the symptoms are mild in a significant portion of infectious subjects/period. On the other hand, the negative log-likelihood objective function is usually dominated by the observations in the original location, where the disease starts spreading. Therefore, it is possible that significantly disturbed observations in the original location lead to biased estimation of the model.

The essential idea is to fit a simple model (3 adjustable parameters in the SEIR model) using the minimum number of data points randomly drawn from the dataset. Algorithm 1. The following Algorithm 1 shows the steps of the algorithm. In the algorithm, the steps from line 7 to line 9 choose the model achieving maximum consensus among the random samples. The function f executes the maximum likelihood model fitting. However, the optimisation has been made straightforward, as there are only n s daily infection data points from one location l i to fit to. We choose n s = 4 in this study to determine the 3 parameters of the SEIR model. So there are 4 constraints and 3 degrees of freedom, where the one extra constraint helps stabilise the optimisation. The function g counts inliers in the whole data for a given SEIR model. To be considered as an inlier, a recorded infection number at time t in place l needs to fall within the 5% to 95% CI of the model prediction at the time and location. Following [6] , we use the Poisson distribution to approximate the probability distribution of the infection number within one day in a location.",
