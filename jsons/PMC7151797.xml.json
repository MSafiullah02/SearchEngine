Respiratory viruses (e.g., influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, coronavirus, adenovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus), enteroviruses (including coxsackievirus and echovirus), herpes simplex virus (HSV), and Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) are frequent causes of pharyngitis. EBV pharyngitis often is accompanied by other clinical findings of infectious mononucleosis (e.g., generalized lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly), and can be exudative and indistinguishable from GAS pharyngitis. HSV pharyngitis often is associated with stomatitis in children, and tends to affect the entire oral mucosa including the gingival, buccal mucosa, and tongue. Enteroviral pharyngitis can be an isolated finding (herpangina), or part of the spectrum of hand-foot-and-mouth disease, and has a typical appearance. Systemic infections with other viruses (e.g., cytomegalovirus, rubella virus, and measles virus) also can include pharyngitis.",

Other causative bacteria include groups C and G \u03b2-hemolytic streptococci (GCS, GGS). Arcanobacterium haemolyticum is a rare cause in adolescents and Neisseria gonorrhoeae can cause acute pharyngitis in sexually active adolescents. Other bacteria such as Francisella tularensis, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Corynebacterium diphtheriae as well as mixed infections with anaerobic bacteria (e.g., Vincent angina) are rare causes. Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae have been implicated rarely, particularly in adults. Although other bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae frequently are isolated from throat cultures of children and adolescents with acute pharyngitis, their etiologic role is not established. Fusobacterium necrophorum, the typical etiologic agent of Lemierre syndrome, also may cause uncomplicated pharyngitis.2 Non-infectious cases of recurrent or prolonged pharyngitis and sore throat include the periodic fever, adenitis, pharyngitis, and aphthous ulcers (PFAPA) syndrome, gastroesophageal reflux and/or laryngopharyngeal reflux, and allergic rhinitis.",

A community-wide outbreak of pharyngitis in children was described in which GGS was isolated from 25% of 222 consecutive children with acute pharyngitis seen in a private pediatric office; results of DNA fingerprinting suggested that 75% of isolates belonged to the same GGS clone.7\n",

Examination typically reveals tonsillopharyngeal erythema with or without exudates, and tender, enlarged anterior cervical lymph nodes. Other findings can include a beefy, red, swollen uvula; petechiae on the palate; and a scarlatiniform rash. No finding is specific for GAS. Many patients with GAS pharyngitis exhibit signs and symptoms that are milder than a \u201cclassic\u201d case of this illness. Some of these patients have bona fide GAS infection (i.e., have a rise in ASO antibodies), whereas others are merely colonized and have an intercurrent viral infection.

Involvement often is more intense along the creases in the antecubital area, axillae, and groin, and petechiae along the creases can occur (Pastia lines). The face usually is spared, although the cheeks can be erythematous with pallor around the mouth (Figure 27-1\n). After 3 to 4 days, the rash begins to fade and is followed by fine desquamation, first on the face, progressing downward. Occasionally, sheet-like desquamation occurs around the fingernails periungually, the palms, and the soles. Pharyngeal findings are the same as with GAS pharyngitis. In addition, the tongue usually is coated and the papillae are swollen. With desquamation, the reddened papillae are prominent, giving the tongue a strawberry appearance.",

Although the use of cephalosporins for GAS pharyngitis could reduce the number of persons (especially chronic carriers) who harbor GAS after completing therapy, empiric first-line use would be associated with substantial economic and possibly ecologic cost. There are compelling reasons (e.g., its narrow antimicrobial spectrum, low cost, and impressive safety profile) to continue to use penicillin as the drug of choice for uncomplicated GAS pharyngitis. Selected use of a first-generation cephalosporin as the drug of choice may be appropriate for patients at high risk of complications (such as a history of rheumatic fever), with severe symptoms, or with a suspected treatment failure or relapse.",

However, most bacteriologic treatment failures are manifestations of the GAS carrier state. Chronic carriers have GAS in their pharynx but no clinical illness or immunologic response to the organism, can be colonized for 6 to \u226512 months, are unlikely to spread GAS to close contacts, and are at very low (if any) risk for developing suppurative or nonsuppurative complications.81, 82 During the winter and spring in temperate climates, as many as 20% of asymptomatic school-aged children carry GAS.81 GAS carriers should not be given antimicrobial therapy; the primary approach to the suspected or confirmed carrier is reassurance. A throat culture or RADT should be performed whenever the patient has symptoms and signs suggestive of GAS pharyngitis, but should be avoided when symptoms are more typical of viral illnesses (see Box 29-1). Each clinical episode confirmed with a positive throat culture or RADT should be treated. Identification and eradication of the streptococcal carrier state are desirable in certain specific situations. When antimicrobial therapy is employed, oral clindamycin (20 mg/kg per day up to 450 mg, divided into 3 doses) for 10 days is preferred,51 but intramuscular benzathine penicillin (alone or in combination with procaine penicillin) plus oral rifampin (20 mg/kg per day divided into 2 doses; maximum dose, 300 mg for 4 days beginning on the day of the penicillin injection)37 also is effective. Chronic carriage can recur upon re-exposure to GAS.",

The fundamental question is whether this patient is experiencing repeated episodes of GAS pharyngitis or is a GAS carrier experiencing repeated episodes of viral pharyngitis. The latter situation is by far the more common. Such a patient is likely to be a GAS carrier if: (1) clinical and epidemiologic findings suggest a viral etiology; (2) there is little clinical response to appropriate antimicrobial therapy; (3) throat culture (or RADT) is positive between episodes of pharyngitis; and (4) there is no serologic response to GAS extracellular antigen (e.g., ASO, anti-deoxyribonucleases B). In contrast, the patient with repeated episodes of acute pharyngitis associated with positive throat cultures (or RADTs) for GAS is likely to be experiencing repeated episodes of bona fide GAS pharyngitis if: (1) clinical and epidemiologic findings suggest GAS pharyngitis; (2) there is a demonstrable clinical response to appropriate antimicrobial therapy; (3) throat culture (or RADT) is negative between episodes of pharyngitis; and (4) there is a serologic response to GAS extracellular antigens. If determined that the patient is experiencing repeated episodes of true GAS pharyngitis, some physicians have suggested use of prophylactic oral penicillin V. However, the efficacy of this regimen has not been proven, and antimicrobial prophylaxis is not recommended except to prevent recurrences of rheumatic fever in patients who have experienced a previous episode of rheumatic fever. Tonsillectomy may be considered in the rare patient whose symptomatic episodes do not diminish in frequency over time and in whom no alternative explanation for the recurrent GAS pharyngitis is evident. However, tonsillectomy has been demonstrated to be beneficial for a relatively small group of these patients, and any benefit is relatively short-lived.83, 84\n",
