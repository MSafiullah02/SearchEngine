            "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has evolved to a global pandemic with more than two million confirmed cases and about 200 thousand deaths so far [1]. The first cases in the United States (U.S.) were reported on January 19th, 2020 in the Washington state [2]. Since then, about one million confirmed cases and sixty thousand deaths have been reported [3]. New York City (NYC) is the current epicenter of the pandemic with about 160 thousand confirmed cases and more than twelve thousand deaths to date [4]. Early reports from Asia and Europe have identified older age, male sex, and chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, hypertension, obesity, coronary artery disease, and heart failure, as risk factors associated with worse outcomes [[5], [6], [7]]. However, little is known about the risk factors and the characteristics of the disease in the United States population and particularly in underrepresented minorities, who appear to be affected disproportionally by COVID-19 [4,7]. The age-adjusted death rate per 100,000 people in NYC is more than double for African Americans compared to Whites (127.1 vs. 63.5) [4]. The higher prevalence of medical conditions that are considered risk factors for severe COVID-19 among African Americans and the higher risk for exposure to SARS-CoV-2 due to living and working conditions seem to be plausible explanations for the observed disproportionate differences in outcomes [7]. The Bronx, which is the most diverse area in the United States as per the 2010 U.S. Census, ranks last among all 62 counties of New York state in health outcomes, quality of life and important health and socioeconomic factors according to County Health Rankings and Roadmaps [8]. In addition, the Bronx has the highest obesity rates among all NYC boroughs and stands remarkably higher than the national average [9,10].",

Severe obesity was defined as BMI \u2265 35 kg/m2. Patients were also classified in four quartiles based on age: \u226450, 51\u201364, 65\u201373, and \u226574 years old. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality. Secondary endpoints included: increasing oxygen requirement during hospital stay and intubation. Deceased patients were excluded from the length of stay analysis. Continuous data are presented as median with interquartile range (IQR) and categorical data as absolute and relative frequencies. The ANOVA test was used to compare the continuous variables, while chi-square was used for discrete variables. Interaction analyses were performed as needed. A logistic regression model was used to identify baseline variables associated with in-hospital mortality, intubation and increasing oxygen requirements. BMI 25\u201334 kg/m2 was used as a reference in order to perform dichotomous comparisons with patients with severe obesity (BMI \u2265 35 kg/m2). In order to build a multivariate model, we used a forward stepwise approach with the following method for each one of the studied outcomes; model 1: BMI and age, model 2: all the variables with significant univariate associations (p value \u2264 0.05), and model 3: the variables of model 2 in addition to clinically significant variables which did not show a significant univariate association. Additional logistic regression analyses with BMI and age handled as continuous variables were performed. Results of logistic regression are given as the odds ratio (OR) with the 95% confidence interval (CI). The threshold of statistical significance was p \u2264 0.05.

The most interesting finding of our analysis is that severe obesity is a significant factor for severe respiratory disease and death in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. It should be pointed out that this association remained significant even after adjusting for several clinical entities, such as diabetes, coronary artery disease, heart failure, COPD, CKD or ESRD, and smoking, which indicates that obesity may predispose to negative outcomes independently. The higher mortality rates in the BMI < 25 kg/m2 and BMI \u2265 35 kg/m2 groups allow to make a hypothesis of a J-shaped distribution between BMI and mortality. However, this was not confirmed in our adjusted analysis presumably because of our small sample and the inherent co-existing factors associated with BMI < 25 (older age, frailty).",

A cohort from China revealed that obesity significantly increases the risk for developing severe pneumonia in the setting of COVID-19 (OR: 3.42; 95% CI: 1.42\u20138.27) [18]. Another report from China indicated that the presence of obesity in patients with metabolic-associated fatty liver disease is associated with an almost 6-fold increased risk of severe COVID-19 [19]. Obesity could partially explain why the mortality rate for COVID-19 is higher in countries with higher prevalence of obesity, such as Italy, as compared to China and Japan [20]. Variables such as diabetes and other cardiovascular and pulmonary comorbidities were found to have a significant association in prior reports from China and Italy [[11], [12], [13], [14]]. However, most of these were obtained from univariate estimates only. In our multivariate analyses it was shown that these comorbidities are likely epiphenomena since they are not independent from male gender, older age or obesity which may be the underlying link.",

Obesity leads to increased work of breathing by augmenting the airway resistance and is associated with decreased expiratory reserve volume, functional capacity, and pulmonary compliance [22,23]. Central obesity results in decreased diaphragmatic excursion in supine patients compromising ventilation [23]. Moreover, obesity is a chronic inflammatory state with increased circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6, and is known to impair the immune system [24,25]. The observed association between severe obesity and mortality may also underlie the observed association between low vitamin D levels, which are low in the obese, and mortality and needs to be explored further [25].",

The patient population that our institution serves mainly includes patients of lower socioeconomic status and people that identify themselves as African American or Hispanic. The combination of these two made up 85.5% of our current study population that is representative of racial and ethnical distribution in the Bronx [27]. The median income, as estimated by the zip codes based on publicly available data provided by the internal revenue service, was not found to be a risk factor for worse outcomes in our study, which is explained by the fact that the Bronx is a homogenous area of low income.",

Additionally, two researchers independently and blindly collected data which reduces errors and bias. On the other hand, our study has several limitations. First, our sample was relatively small, but given the nature of the evolving pandemic, it was of paramount importance to make our early data and findings widely available as soon as possible, especially given the lack of data up to date in COVID-19 in minorities and underserved population. We noted that among elderly, not only high BMI but also BMI <25 was associated with worse in-hospital outcomes. Therefore, we proceeded to interaction analyses between variables that were shown to be associated with the outcomes in the adjusted analyses (BMI, age, sex) but no correlation was found. Given that our study size was relatively small, future larger studies need to explore effect modification and the interaction between these variables. Second, this was a real-world study with a retrospective design utilizing the electronic medical records, which is suboptimal compared to a prospective study that could have more accurate follow-up assessment. Third, the rapidly changing management of COVID-19 might have affected our results but it is highly unlikely that this could have differentially affected associations between obesity and mortality. Fourth, we handled BMI as a categorical variable in the regression analysis with cut-off points largely representing quartiles of BMI. However, we also performed additional analyses with BMI as a dichotomous (cut-off: 35 kg/m2) or a continuous variable and the significant associations persisted.",

Particular attention should be paid in preventing obesity and its complications and protecting this population from COVID-19 given the higher chance for adverse outcomes once they are diagnosed with the disease. In addition, obese patients diagnosed with COVID-19 should be treated with particular attention given the possible higher risk for adverse outcomes. While we recognize the limitations, we hope that our study will stimulate additional researchers to further study the effect of obesity in COVID-19 and outcomes of minorities diagnosed with COVID-19. Larger cohort studies are needed to confirm our data and pilot clinical trials are needed to assess whether pharmacotherapy for obesity and its comorbidities may improve outcomes in the short or the long term.",
