            "text": "Across the UK, 187 individuals currently working as foster carers at their private homes or in residential homes for young people in care took part in the survey. Nine organisations managing paid carers of children in public care distributed the survey link to relevant individuals: three local authorities, two independent fostering agencies, three charities or not-for-profit agencies and one residential care home. Seven further organisations were approached but did not respond. Although most residential workers do not normally live on the premises, their role still involves engaging with children over time, sharing their daily lives and being potentially exposed to children\u2019s trauma. They were therefore included in the present study. Demographic information for the sample is presented in Table 1. Disclosed employers were based almost exclusively in England, with four stating they fostered in Wales or Scotland. The sample were predominately female (n = 152, 81%), with a mean age of 50 years and an average foster carer experience of 9 years. The sample had similar demographics compared to Hannah and Woolgar (2018) and Ottaway and Selwyn (2016) and is very close to the known demographics of the current foster carer population in the UK (The Fostering Network 2019).",

Ten items assessed burnout (\u03b1 = 0.79) predominantly as affect ratings related to wellbeing (e.g., \u201cI am happy.\u201d) and to the work situation (e.g., \u201cI feel trapped by my job as a foster carer.\u201d), including aspects of work overload and attitudes towards the work role. Ten items assessed CS (\u03b1 = 0.88) as the quantified professional pleasure and experienced benefit derived from helping others (e.g., \u201cI feel invigorated after working with those I help.\u201d).",

Likewise, the cut-off for burnout was higher among foster carers (28) than in the reference sample (25). In other words, foster carers falling into the top 25 percent of the distribution showed higher reported STS and burnout when compared to the general sample described in Stamm (2010).

In contrast to our expectations, CS positively predicted STS. This result also presented a change from the bivariate correlation between STS and CS, which had been found to be negative (see Table 2). All other associations in the model were in the expected direction, except for the direct paths from empathy, resilience and self-care to STS, which were all three not significant. Given that all paths from empathy, resilience and self-care to CS and burnout were significant, mediation effects were put to further tests. For this, indirect effects were estimated using bootstrapping in AMOS with 1000 iterations and bias-corrected 95% confidence intervals. A significant indirect effect was found for self-care on STS (95% CI [\u22120.34, \u22120.14], p = 0.04), suggesting that CS and burnout mediate a negative effect of self-care on STS. Neither for resilience (95% CI [\u22120.20, 0.01], p = 0.10) nor empathy (95% CI [\u22120.16, 0.05], p = 0.35) were indirect effects significant.",

The response format in the study encouraged short answers, typically taking the form of part sentences or keyword-type entries. This necessarily meant that thematic complexity in the analyses was somewhat restricted. In response to the question \u201cWhat most helps you to maintain your own wellbeing?\u201d time was a predominant aspect. Time with others was most frequently mentioned (f = 58; e.g. \u201cmy husband and older children\u201d \u201cfriends and family\u201d) and the closely related theme of social support was likewise among the top 3 themes (f = 27; e.g. \u201csupportive close friends\u201d). This is complemented by the themes of time away (f = 18; e.g. \u201ctime away from the foster child to relax\u201d) and time alone (f = 9; e.g. \u201ctime for myself\u201d). In response to the question \u201cWhat support do you most need as a Foster Carer that is not available?\u201d it is important to note that 28 respondents stated no concerns. Time, again, was the most prominent theme named (f = 28; e.g. \u201cregular breaks/guilt free respite\u201d). Other themes clearly indicate a perceived lack of contributions from the (professional) environment: general professional support, specific training, and therapeutic support came up collectively 44 times (e.g. \u201cthe offer of regular counselling/therapy if needed\u201d).",

It is possible that the stated survey aims (secondary trauma and burnout) may have influenced the type of respondent whereby foster carers experiencing higher levels of stress may have been more inclined to respond, and those who perceived STS as stigmatised may have opted not to respond. Other limitations are design-related. As a cross-sectional study, it is not possible to draw conclusions regarding the direction of effects represented by the correlations. Longitudinal studies would be beneficial to explore both the complex interaction between the three subscale measures of burnout, STS and CS, and the other predictor variables. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include the perspective of those who are being cared for. Of particular benefit would be to measure the extent of foster children\u2019s exposure to trauma and the level to which foster carers engaged in therapeutic parenting, along with some of the effects on children. However, this is a hard-to-reach population, and the current findings in themselves advance substantially our understanding of predicting STS in this population.",

The results lend support to STS preventative interventions which should (1) seek to reduce burnout through structural support and (2) encourage self-care to increase resources which may buffer the development of STS. While the direct contribution of empathy and resilience to STS variance was not supported, they both contributed positively, alongside self-care, to compassion satisfaction and burnout variance. Interventions for foster carers may be most effective, however, when they aim to both prevent STS and burnout, and at the same time promote CS.",
