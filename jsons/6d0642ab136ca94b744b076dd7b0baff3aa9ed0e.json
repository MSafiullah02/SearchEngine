As in many other arenas, pathology plays a vital part in improving our understanding of the mechanisms by which viruses cause disease. Pathological assessment sheds light on the ways viruses interact with cells and tissues, spread within and transmit between hosts. The eventual pathological outcomes are a complex interplay between the host response to, and the direct effects of, the virus infection. In keeping with these considerations, this issue contains articles that address the roles that cell and tissue biology and pathology are playing in the elucidation of the mechanisms of virus-associated diseases.",

This is exemplified by the ongoing outbreak of Ebola virus in West Africa and, at the time of writing, the importation of infections into Europe and the USA. Such events act as timely reminders of the potential for viruses to cause global disease and it is fitting that our first article deals with filoviruses. Zaki and colleagues have produced a tour de force, describing what Ebola and Marburg viruses are and how and why they are so highly pathogenic in humans. As two of 150 Introductory Article and the complex way in which these viruses induce disease through multiple effects on the immune system and endothelium [3] . In the first of two reviews on coronaviruses, Grolinski and Baric discuss the importance of the innate immune response in the development of lung pathology following human coronavirus infection, whilst van den Brand, Smits and Haagmans review the available clinical and pathological data on Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in comparison to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and how these inform our understanding of both the different pathological effects of these viruses and their responses to interferon-based therapies [4, 5] . Staying with the theme of emerging infectious diseases and viral zoonoses, de Wit and Munster review the pathogenesis of encephalitis and vasculitis caused by the outbreaks of Nipah virus. They focus on dissemination of the virus through its host, current knowledge of the determinants of pathogenicity and the routes of zoonotic and human-to-human transmission, emphasizing the key role played by animal models in advancing our understanding of this virus and the diseases it causes [6] . Karst et al review the molecular pathology of norovirus (the cause of 'winter vomiting disease'), one of the main causes of acute gastroenteritis, but also now appreciated as causing chronic effects and extra-intestinal spread [7] .",

It has been suggested that it may be possible to eradicate measles virus (MV), and even though this is probably not feasible for mumps virus (MuV), huge advances in reducing the disease burden have been achieved for both. Despite these successes, these viruses continue to cause human disease in both the developing and the developed world. Rubin et al have combined their expertise to review the renewed interest in mumps pathogenesis arising from the resurgence of this disease in the highly vaccinated populations in Europe and the USA. They emphasize the need to develop clinically-relevant animal models of disease, which are necessary to ensure that unsafe vaccines are not licensed [10] . In addition, Ludlow et al provide an up-to-date review of measles pathogenesis. They highlight how recent advances in understanding virus-receptor usage explains why the virus infects both epithelial and immune cells and how the inter-related, and opposing, effects of these two distinct tissue tropisms modulate disease [11] . These reviews are followed by articles that provide an in-depth analysis of human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza. In the first of these, Pickles and DeVincenzo review the pathogenesis of bronchiolitis caused by RSV, with a particular emphasis on the cytopathological effects of viral infection on columnar cells, leading to the pathological sequelae of bronchiolar obstruction and inflammation [12] . The review on influenza by Kuiken et al discusses how the olfactory system acts as an important conduit for virus spread to the central nervous system. Using data from human and animal infections, they provide compelling evidence that many viruses use this route and discuss current understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved [13] .",

In their review of varicelloviruses, Ouwendijk and Verjans include an up-to-date analysis of both human and animal infections.

The first article, from Vockerodt et al, reviews recent insights into the mechanisms of EBV-associated lymphoma development [18] , whilst Lo and colleagues re-evaluate the mechanisms Introductory Article 151 exploited as targeted therapy for EBV-associated malignancies [20] . Feltkamp et al provide a comprehensive review of the role played by \u03b2-human papillomaviruses (HPVs) in human basal and squamous carcinomas of the skin, and their synergy with immunosuppression and exposure to UV radiation [20] , contrasting with the more well-defined relationship between \u03b1-HPV types and cervical and other squamous cancers. Ringelhan et al provide a timely update on the role of chronic hepatitis B virus infection in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which involves both direct effects of viral gene expression and indirect effects of infection [22] .

            "text": "These articles not only provide a comprehensive view of how viruses cause disease but also demonstrate the critical role that pathology plays in this field [24] . Recently there has been a true renaissance in appreciating the power of sound observations, where pathology is not 'just descriptive' but rather is the bedrock for meaningful hypothesis-driven research. This illustrates the unique opportunities for virologists and pathologists interested in dissecting the molecular mechanisms of viral disease to work together, develop partnerships and drive the field forward. Such studies will help extend our understanding of virus transmission from animals to humans and from humans to humans. The need to understand transmission fully is exemplified by the current Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa. Moreover, the development of animal models that can be used to test novel vaccines and antivirals is vital. Only by understanding how these interventions modulate the resulting disease, through the involvement of pathologists, can basic scientists know their translational goals are closer. We hope that these contributions demonstrate that this is the case not only for the cancer-associated viruses, where the interface with pathology is more widely appreciated, but also for the more classical infectious diseases, for which tissue-based studies can also provide essential information in the context of 'real' disease. Going forward, the increasing availability and use of 'omics' technologies in virology [25] [26] [27] has tremendous potential for rapidly identifying new viruses and their host interactions, including immune responses. Nevertheless, in this new era, pathology will continue to be a vital component of identifying the true relationships between viruses and human disease, and we hope that this Annual Review Issue will serve as a blueprint for future studies in the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of virus-related conditions through an improved understanding of the processes involved.",
