Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is the most aggressive human agent, causing the lung disease SARS (Drosten et al., 2003a). HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 were discovered in 2004 and 2005, respectively (van der Hoek et al., 2004, Woo et al., 2005).

Coronaviruses represent the group of RNA viruses with the largest RNA genome known to date. Compared to other RNA viruses, the coronavirus polymerase has a rather low error frequency and may possess a RNA proof reading activity (Denison et al., 2011). However, the development of resistant mutants in the presence of drugs targeting coronaviral proteins remains a serious concern. Virus replication depends on a variety of host factors (de Haan and Rottier, 2006, Vogels et al., 2011, Zhang et al., 2010), which in turn represent potential antiviral targets. These might be more preferable targets than viral proteins as development of resistance is much less likely.",

We identified Cyclosporin A (CsA) as a potent replication inhibitor of various human and animal CoVs (Pfefferle et al., 2011). Inhibition of SARS-CoV, HCoV-229E and, in addition, of Mouse Hepatitis Virus was also confirmed by de Wilde et al. (de Wilde et al., 2011). Cyclophilins and FK506-binding proteins are collectively referred to as immunophilins because they bind the immunosuppressive drugs CsA and FK506, respectively. Furthermore, they share peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPIase) domains and chaperone functions facilitating protein folding (Davis et al., 2010). CsA was recently shown to exert inhibitory effects on herpes simplex virus, vaccinia virus (Damaso and Keller, 1994), BK polyoma virus (Acott et al., 2008), human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) (Briggs et al., 1999, Wainberg et al., 1988) and HCV (Fischer et al., 2010, Nakagawa et al., 2004, Watashi et al., 2003). Whereas cyclophilins were reported to be required for replication of HIV-1 (Franke and Luban, 1996), vesicular stomatitis virus (Bose et al., 2003) and HCV (Nakagawa et al., 2005), FK506-binding proteins were not found to play a role in the replication of HIV-1 (Briggs et al., 1999) and HCV (Nakagawa et al., 2004, Watashi et al., 2003). Orthopoxviruses are inhibited by FK506 (Reis et al., 2006).",

Although it is structurally unrelated to the cyclic undecapeptide CsA both molecules display similar properties of binding to the catalytic pocket of the PPIase domains of their cellular binding partners resulting in inhibition of their PPIase activities (Barik, 2006). Furthermore, the cyclophilin-CsA and FKBP-FK506 complexes bind to the cellular phosphatase calcineurin (CnA) which inhibits the dephosphorylation and activity of the nuclear factor of activated T-cells. The inhibition of this essential transcriptional regulator of important immune genes is the cause of immunosuppression. It is important to note that binding of the FKBP/FK506 complex to CnA, which is required for immunosuppression, and inhibition of PPIase activitiy, which is responsible for antiviral activity, are two independent mechanisms.",

Since Nsp1 also interacted with FK506-binding proteins FKBP1A and FKBP1B, we examined in this study whether FK506 inhibits replication of human coronaviruses. In a first experiment VeroFM cells were infected with SARS-CoV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.0001 in the presence of increasing concentrations of CsA and FK506. Virus RNA concentrations were measured after 24 h in supernatant of infected cells by real-time RT-PCR (Drosten et al., 2003b). Titers were reduced 128,740-fold by 33 \u03bcM CsA, and 11,112 fold by 49 \u03bcM FK506, respectively. Fig. 1A shows the percentage of SARS-CoV inhibition under the influence of FK506, with an EC50 inhibitory concentration of about 6.9 \u03bcM. In Fig. 1B the corresponding log10 titer reductions are represented.",

PCR primers used were NL-63RF2 for 5\u2032-CTTCTGGTGACGCTAGTACAGCTTAT-3\u2032 (genome position nt 14459\u201314484) and NL-63RR2rev 5\u2032-AGACGTCGTTGTAGATCCCTAACAT-3\u2032 (genome position nt 14573\u201314597) and NL-63 probe was 5\u2032-FAM-CAGGTTGCTTAGTGTCCCATCAGATTCAT-TAMRA-3\u2032 (genome position nt 14532\u201314560). The EC50 inhibitory concentration for HCoV-NL63 was about 5.1 \u03bcM and replication was completely inhibited at 36 \u03bcM FK506 (Fig. 1C), reflecting a 732-fold reduction of virus replication (Fig. 1D). At this concentration cell viability (CellTiterGlo, Promega) was still about 75%. Inhibition of virus growth in CaCo2 cells was also confirmed by plaque titration assay (Herzog et al., 2008) using serial virus dilutions in the presence of FK506 concentrations ranging from 0 \u03bcM to 24 \u03bcM. Fig. 1E and F shows percentage and log reductions of inhibition of virus replication, respectively. Under the conditions of the plaque assay involving virus growth for four days, the decrease of virus titers occurred in a more linear fashion with an EC50 of about 13.4 \u03bcM (E). Complete inhibition was observed at 24 \u03bcM with a reduction by more than five orders of magnitude (F).",

HuH7 cells were infected with MOI = 0.1 and incubated for two days in the presence of increasing concentrations of FK506 in the culture medium. Viral replication was determined by measuring Renilla luciferase activity. Fig. 2A and B shows percent and Log reductions of virus growth, respectively. About 5.4 \u03bcM FK506 were found to be effective as an EC50 for HCoV-229E-luc. Cell viability was reduced to about 70% (at 24 \u03bcM) as compared to untreated cells, indicating that virus reduction was due to the drug but not to cell death. Fig. 2C and D shows a microscopic comparison of HCoV-229E-GFP infection under increasing concentrations of CsA and FK506. Reduction of virus infection was quantified by determining fluorescence intensity from microscope images of infected Huh7 cells. The pictures were analysed by using the software ImageJ 1.44 (Abramoff et al., 2004, Rasband, 1997). The integrated density for three different regions of interest was measured in each picture and the obtained averages were used to calculate correlates of virus replication efficiency. The determined EC50 was 12.2 \u03bcM for FK506 under these conditions. GFP fluorescence was inversely correlated to inhibitor concentration, with DAPI staining of cell nuclei indicating confluence of HuH7 cells and equivalent cell densities at all concentration steps. Virus growth was completely abolished between concentration of 8\u201312 \u03bcM CsA and 18\u201325 \u03bcM FK506. The latter correlates well with the inhibitory concentration determined for HCoV-229E-luc. For both HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63, EC50 values were higher in plaque and GFP titrations as compared to direct replication assays by either RT-PCR or luciferase measurement. However, deviations between both assay formats were only by factors of 3.2 (HCoV-NL63) and 2.6 (HCoV-229E).",

Cells were transduced at MOI 30 with MISSIONTM lentiviral non-target control, cyclophilin B (PPIB), FKBP1A, or FKBP1B shRNA lentiviruses. Sequences used for gene knockdown are listed in Table 1A. Stable shRNA-expressing cells were generated through 3 weeks of bulk-selection in 10\u201315 \u03bcg/ml puromycin-containing medium (DMEM + 10% FCS + 2 mM l-glutamine + 1 mM Na-pyruvate). The high puromycin concentration needed for selection of CaCo2 cells might result from an enhanced expression of MDR-1 (multi drug resistant protein 1 gene) depleting cells very efficiently from inhibitory drug molecules (Takara et al., 2002). From the bulk-selected knockdown and control cells mRNA expression was quantified by real-time RT-PCR. For reverse transcription 1 \u03bcg of total RNA was used. Amplification products were detected by SYBR I, and amplicon integrity was verified by melting point analysis. Cyclophilin A (PPIA) served as a reference gene against PPIB to determine the specificity of the knockdown. mRNA expression levels of PPIB, FKBP1A, and FKBP1B were then determined by real-time RT-PCR with primers listed in Table 1B. Fig. 3A shows PPIB, FKBP1A and FKBP1B mRNA expression in bulk-selected CaCo2 cells. In comparison to non-target controls a 98% and 96% knockdown was determined for PPIB and FKBP1A/1B, respectively.",

In a comparative study of the effect of CsA and FK506 on HIV-1, the former inhibited virus replication completely (IC50: 1\u20132 \u03bcg/ml) whereas latter had an inhibitory effect on chronically but not on newly infected cells [up to 10 \u03bcg/ml FK506 (Briggs et al., 1999)]. Also in the case of HCV, FK506 had no effect on the replication of replicon RNA up to concentrations of 3 \u03bcg/ml (Watashi et al., 2003). Considering the higher drug concentrations of CsA and FK506 needed for inhibition of coronavirus replication it can be speculated that also HIV-1 and HCV might be inhibited by higher FK506 concentrations. It also remains to be clarified why the low nanomolar affinities of FKBP1A/B to FK506 do not reflect the EC50 inhibitory concentrations of coronaviruses which reside in the low micromolar range. This might be explained by a stronger affinity of coronavirus proteins to the cellular proteins as compared to FK506.",

As the two proteins share about 83% homology on the amino acid level (not shown) they do not substitute for each other upon individual knockdown. A common structural feature of FKBP proteins is the PPIase domain, also called FK506-binding domain. Its peptidylprolyl cis/trans isomerase activity influences cellular pathways by binding to cellular proteins (Kang et al., 2008). These activities are common to many FKBP family members containing a PPIase domain and separate chaperone functions can be discriminated from them (Barik, 2006).",
