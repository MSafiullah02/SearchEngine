Her post-transplant course had been unremarkable except for persistent Ebstein Barr Virus (EBV) viremia for which the intensity of immunosuppression had been reduced to tacrolimus monotherapy. In the first week of March 2020 the patient developed a productive cough with rhinorrhea and nasal congestion. She was afebrile with no symptoms of shortness-of-breath. A month prior to this illness she was treated for febrile bronchiolitis as an outpatient. Potential for COVID-19 disease was considered but community incidence was low at the time, the patient had no Center for Disease Control risk factors for infection, and testing was not widely available. One-week later a follow-up telehealth visit was performed with improvement in severity of cough and she remained afebrile. Surveillance laboratory studies including complete blood count, EBV whole blood DNA, and anti-human leukocyte antigen antibody testing by Luminex assay happened to be performed at that time. were deferred and patient eventually discharged. Repeat SARS-CoV-2 nasal PCR was planned for two weeks with repeat anti HLA antibody testing and IVIG administration repeated every month for two more months.",

In vitro data suggest inhibition of viral replication of human coronaviruses by FK-506. 4 Interestingly, de novo donor specific Class II antibodies also were detected during the infection. Allosensitization following viral infections is described and due to the reduced amount of immunosuppression our patient may have been prone to this phenomenon. 5 This patient tolerated IVIG administration with concurrent COVID-19 infection without any notable reaction. We would be hesitant to attempt more aggressive forms of desensitization with active infection until more clinical knowledge of COVID-19 infection is available. Although mechanisms and relationship between allosensitization and COVID-19 remain uncertain, we suggest careful measurement of donor specific antibodies be undertaken in heart transplant survivors of this infection.",

Due to the history of cough our patient immediately underwent SARS-CoV-2 RNA nasal swab reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing and was placed under enhanced droplet precautions. Admission vitals were notable for axillary temperature 36.4\u00b0C, heart rate 123 beats per minute, respiratory rate 24 breath per minute, systemic oxygen saturation of 96%. Examination was notable for intermittent wet cough but with no increased work of breathing and clear breath sounds on auscultation. Overnight, the patient tolerated administration of 0.5g/kg of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) without complication. The SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR returned positive the following morning. The patient remained well appearing without symptoms of respiratory distress and vital signs remained unchanged.
