In effect, these mask-off settings allowed the sharing of their saliva and respiratory droplets which may contain a viral load of 100 million per ml directly or indirectly [16, 17] . In HKSAR hospitals, wearing face masks is mandatory during the pandemic. It is also the practice among many community service providers and those who are working indoors. Since the supply of face mask was tight in the community as well as in the healthcare setting, it is the practice of our general public of not using more than one face mask per person per day. We observed that the overall compliance of face mask usage was 97% in all administrative districts in the morning.

Our incidence of COVID-19 was also lower than that of other areas with local transmission, vindicating this approach. In particular, our incidence of COVID-19 was significantly lower than that of Singapore, a city comparable with HKSAR in terms of area, population density, healthcare infrastructure, BCG vaccination [19] , as well as adopting social distancing strategies and SARS-CoV-2 testing infrastructure [20] . Besides a lower ambient temperature and a higher risk of importation of COVID-19 cases from the mainland which are factors promoting COVID-19 transmission in HKSAR, the most important difference between the two cities is the community-wide usage of face masks in HKSAR but not in Singapore. Moreover, 50% of local transmission of COVID-19 in South Korea was attributed to religious activities where face mask usage was discouraged. Mask-off activities clearly have potential implications for COVID-19 transmission in the community.",

European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control issued a technical report on 8 April 2020 that the use of face masks in the community could be considered, especially when visiting busy, closed spaces, despite not knowing how much the use of masks in the community can contribute to a decrease in transmission in addition to the other counter measures [24] . On 3 April 2020, CDC recommends the use of cloth face coverings, especially in areas of significant communitybased transmission [25] . The shift of paradigm from not recommending to promoting the use of face masks was based on the rationale of pre-symptomatic shedding of SARS-Cov-2 and presence of asymptomatic patients with high viral load in the community [9, 26] . The use of face mask may serve as source control by preventing dispersal of droplets during talking, sneezing, and coughing [27] , and also reduce the risk of environmental contamination by SARS-CoV-2. Masking is a continuous form of protection to stop the spreading of saliva and respiratory droplets to others or from others, and to the environment or from the environment to the susceptible by hands through touching of nose, mouth and eye. Touching nose and mouth is a subconscious behavior [28] . Hand hygiene is always the cornerstone to prevent transmission of COVID-19 but it is a one-off discontinuous process where hand contamination may occur easily between each alcoholic handrubbing or hand washing.",

These ex vivo findings supported the suggestion that an important proportion of COVID-19 patients may be pre-symptomatic or mildly symptomatic virus shedders.

When the causative agent of COVID-19 was identified on 9 January 2020 (day 10), and named as SARS-CoV-2 on 12 February 2020 (day 44), this emerging pathogen was perceived to be as detrimental as 2003 SARS-CoV by the HKSAR general public. Even though initially HKSAR government only advocated people with respiratory symptoms to wear a surgical mask according to the recommendations of WHO and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the United States, the general public volunteered to wear face mask quite compliantly from the pre-pandemic to pandemic phase of COVID-19. Sixty-seven staff members (9 from Infection Control Unit, and 58 from Department of Microbiology), residing in all 18 administrative districts in HKSAR, recorded the number of persons not wearing face mask among the first 50 people they encountered during their morning commute to Queen Mary Hospital (located in Southern district) between 7:00am to 9:00am over three consecutive days from 6 April to 8 April 2020 (day 98 to day 100). A total of 10,050 persons were observed. Only 337 (3.4%) persons did not wear face mask. The daily compliance of face mask usage was 97.2%, 97.1%, and 95.7% over three consecutive days in all 18 administrative districts in HKSAR. Besides proactive infection control measures implemented by public hospitals under the governance of Hospital Authority [5, 6], step-wise introduction of epidemiological measures by the HKSAR government were enforced. They included border controls to reduce imported SARS-CoV-2 cases from mainland China on 4 February 2020 (day 36). This was followed by imposing home quarantine order for 14 days to all entrees from mainland China on 8 February 2020 (day 40). Subsequently, the quarantine order was progressively imposed to all entrees into HKSAR on and after 19 March 2020 (day 80) (Figure 1). All entrees were compulsorily tested for SARS-CoV-2 by collecting their posterior oropharyngeal saliva with effect from 8 April 2020 (day 100). As in other localities, isolation of confirmed case, contact tracing and quarantine, closure of affected or high risk premises, and social distancing measures such as home-office and school closure were instituted.",

As of 14 April 2020 (day 82 since the first reported case in Singapore), Singapore government has started to enforce a penalty of 300 Singapore dollar for anyone going out from home without a mask [36].
