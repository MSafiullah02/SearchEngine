            "text": "In the long term, the development of vaccines and antiviral therapy needs to be a higher priority than it has been since the SARS pandemic in 2002 to 2003; the lack of a SARS vaccine or SARS antiviral therapy suggests that such research has not been a priority. For example, Ampligen (poly I:poly C124) has been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV in a murine lung model, yet has not been further evaluated in humans. 20 Similarly, Remdesivir (GS-5734) has been shown to inhibit both epidemic and zoonotic coronaviruses. 21 It is likely that continued investigation of new antiviral agents with activity against coronaviruses in the absence of ongoing active epidemics would be enhanced by government incentives. Another issue in the long term that needs to be addressed is the potential of novel coronaviruses to spread within medical centers to health care workers as has happened with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. [22] [23] [24] Most medical centers, whether in China or in the United States, are not prepared for such a problem. For example, negative-pressure containment rooms with proper anterooms are either not found or found only in limited numbers in medical centers in the United States. 25 The recent epidemic in China caused by the SARS-CoV-2 is yet another example of emerging zoonotic viral diseases. 18 Like previous epidemics/pandemics caused by novel members of the coronavirus family, there are many lessons to be learned. Much work remains to be done before this latest coronavirus is fully understood and these lessons can be learned.",

            "text": "second reason is simply the timing of this outbreak; the outbreak began just before the Chinese New Year. By the time the investigation had been completed, the Chinese New Year was underway. The Chinese New Year is one of the most important holidays in China and celebrates the beginning of the new year on the traditional Chinese calendar. The first day of the Chinese New Year was on 25 January 2020. The Chinese New Year is associated with a number of customs; among these is returning home for an annual reunion dinner. Thus, traveling home had already begun by the time Chinese authorities attempted to curtail the spread of the coronavirus by extending the lunar new year holidays and suspending travel. 14 This made control measure of the outbreak more difficult. The net effect of the initial delay in the investigation and the holiday travel was, in effect, the \"Perfect Storm.\"The results of the spread within China of the SARS-CoV-2 are considerable and still unfolding. Given the timing of this outbreak, the inability of the Chinese government's measures to control this epidemic and limit most of these cases to Wuhan is understandable.",
