TBVs function via the induction of antibodies that block the fertilization or the penetration of the mosquito midgut by sexual stage parasite, thereby breaking the cycle of parasite transmission between human and mosquito hosts1\u20133. Several sexual stage antigens (e.g., Pfs25, Pfs230 and Pfs48/45) have been identified as promising TBV targets for research or early stage clinical development. In clinical testing, Pfs25, when delivered as nanoparticles4, induced functional antibodies. However, the responses were of low magnitude and short-lived5,6. In recent years, development attention has shifted to the TBV candidates Pfs230 and Pfs48/45 in view of the poor outcomes associated with Pfs25-based constructs and the fact that sera from Plasmodium infected individuals are associated with transmission-blocking antibodies attributable to these gametocyte surface antigens7. Moreover, affinity purified anti-Pfs48/45 and anti-Pfs230 antibodies from naturally exposed individuals can prevent the transmission of cultured P. falciparum gametocytes8, when concentrated nine times the physiological concentration, thereby demonstrating the functionality of these natural antibody responses and the potential for these antigens in TBV development.",

This difficulty in expression has largely been attributed to its three-domain structure and large number of disulfide bonds (16 cysteines arranged as eight disulfide pairs). Conformational monoclonal antibodies are available and have facilitated the design and characterization of recombinant Pfs48/45 proteins. For example, rat monoclonal antibody 85RF45.1, developed by Roeffen et al. using the native gametocyte antigen, recognizes the C-terminal epitope I15 and possesses potent transmission-blocking activities (TBA) with an IC80 of 1\u20133 \u00b5g/mL as measured in the SMFA16. To design a recombinant TBV, Outchkourov et al. analyzed the transmission-blocking (TB) epitopes on the Pfs48/45 protein and determined the C-terminal six-cysteine module termed 6C was recognized by the 85RF45.1 monoclonal antibody17. An extended design including the middle four-cysteine module and the C-terminal 6C, designated as 10C, has also been attempted. When the 10C protein was fused with maltose binding protein and expressed in the E.coli periplasmic space18, the resulting protein was functionally active in mice, however, the overall yield (1 mg/L culture) was too low for vaccine development.",

Bacterial expression systems have generally been preferred, given their ability to produce a non-glycosylated protein, but have also been challenging given the complex structural nature of Pfs48/45. Singh et al. reported successful expression and characterization of 6C as a chimera fused with N-terminal region of GLURP (R0) and a C-terminal his tag in the Lactococcus lactis system20. Biochemical characterization has also been well reported for R0.6C, with a final purified yield of 25 mg/L culture as well as the ability to elicit functional antibodies in rats20. While this approach is promising, we sought to generate Pfs48/45 antigens that might focus the immune response onto the 6C region alone without fusion partners.",

Such systems add additional complexity since Plasmodium parasites lack N-linked glycosylation machinery21 but Pfs48/45 contains seven potential N-glycosylation sites when expressed in eukaryotic systems. Thus, the protein could be aberrantly glycosylated impacting the ability to generate functional antibodies. Evidence suggested by Kapula et al. that expression in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells of unmodified Pfs48/45 (48/45 +Ngln) and modified Pfs48/45 that removes glycosylation sites (48/45-NGln) could be achieved22. Unfortunately, the resulting recombinant protein contained high molecular weight aggregates, with modified (-NGln) demonstrating no significant TBA. This work demonstrated the importance of the primary sequence integrity for this protein. Mamedov et al. co-expressed Pfs48/45 with Endoglycosidase H (Endo H) in the plant based expression system and the recombinant deglycosylated Pfs48/45 generated functional antibodies in mice23. This work demonstrated the feasibility of recombinant expression of full-length Pfs48/45 protein.",

In view of this success, we tested whether full-length Pfs48/45, the 6C domain protein and the 6C mutant can be produced using this system, and whether the expressed proteins retained native conformation to elicit TBA. We report here the biochemical and immunological characterization of the expressed proteins, and the results suggest that the 6C fragment may be feasible from a vaccine development perspective given further optimization.

A signal peptide (MKFLVNVALVFMVVYISYIYAD) to facilitate secretion through ER pathway, and a six histidine C-terminal tag were included to facilitate protein expression and purification of the full-length Pfs48/45 (aa 28-427), 6C fragment (aa 291\u2013427) and 6C Mutant (aa 291\u2013427 with N299Q and N303D mutations). In this report, these three recombinant proteins are designated Pfs48/45-FL, 6C and 6C-Mut, respectively, as derived from baculovirus expression. The insect cells used in the baculovirus system have active glycosylation machinery while the evidence to date is that P. falciparum parasites do not21. To address the glycosylation propensity of the Pfs48/45 molecule during insect cell production, two approaches were undertaken. In an effort to minimize modifications (e.g., mutations) to the native gene sequence, the primary approach was to include tunicamycin, an antibiotic, in the expression culture as it has been demonstrated to effectively inhibit N-glycosylation in the insect/baculovirus expression system28,29. The secondary approach to eliminate N-glycosylation in the 6C fragment was to mutate the two high probability N-glycosylation sites at positions N299 and N303 in the 6C construct (termed 6C-Mut).",

It should be noted, as shown in Supplementary Table S1, that tunicamycin significantly inhibited cell growth, and this inhibition may have impacted protein expression overall. The recombinant proteins were not expressed in the supernatant but were rather located in cell pellets as indicated by SDS-PAGE and anti-his Western (Fig. 1). All three proteins were expressed at the expected molecular weight (Fig. 1a). However, the Pfs48/45-FL and 6C protein both presented as double bands (Fig. 1b) in the presence of 0 or 0.2 \u00b5g/mL tunicamycin, likely the result of glycosylation. At tunicamycin concentrations of 1 \u00b5g/mL, the glycosylation appeared completely inhibited as the proteins presented as a single band (Fig. 1b). Tunicamycin did not impact the banding pattern of 6C-Mut (Fig. 1b), which presented as a single band under all conditions, as N-glycosylation was already likely inhibited through the mutation of the two high probability N-glycosylation sites.",

The initial process, as presented here yielded <3 mg of purified protein per liter of culture for 6C and 6C-Mut. These yields were considered low, but sufficient to conduct initial evaluations. The Pfs48/45-FL was produced in even smaller quantities (<0.1 mg/L culture). Due to the much higher yield of the 6C fragment, we now prefer this as a candidate antigen, however, production of the full-length was sufficient to be used as a comparator in subsequent in vivo studies. Efforts to improve expression were not explored further in the study reported here, and yield optimization would be required for further development as a TBV antigen. This however remains plausible given our past experience in process optimization10, and with new focus on maximizing yield from the cell pellet, knowing that a homogeneous properly disulfide-paired protein can result.",

Biological activity of induced antibodies was then evaluated by SMFA using purified IgG derived from serum pool from all mice in each immunization group. In the initial assay (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table S2, Feed #1), all purified IgGs (one pooled sample per group of 10 mice) were tested at 750 \u03bcg/mL. The IgGs from 6C (3 \u00b5g) and 6C (10 \u00b5g) groups were associated with significant reductions in oocyst density (>98% reduction, p <0.001 compared to adjuvant only negative control for both), while the IgGs from Pfs48/45-FL (3 \u00b5g) and 6C-Mut (10 \u00b5g) groups showed <10% reduction (p > 0.87). To confirm the functional activities of anti-6C IgGs, the two samples were further tested at three concentrations in an independent assay (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table S2, Feed #2). Significant reduction in oocyst density was reproduced by IgGs tested at 750 \u03bcg/mL (>89% reduction, p < 0.001). Although percentage reductions at lower concentrations (250 and 83 \u00b5g/mL) did not reach significant level for both IgGs, a trend toward dose-dependent oocyst density reductions was observed.",

The intact MS results (Fig. 4) indicated that the observed mass of the 6C fragment was +115 Da (Dalton) higher than its theoretical value of molecular mass. This mass difference was likely due to the inclusion of an N-terminal Asp residue from the last amino acid of the signal peptide, as reported previously9,25. After correcting for the Asp addition at the N-terminal, the predominant intact mass of 16,177 \u00b1 1 Da (n = 3) matched the prediction for the non-reduced form of the 6C fragment. Upon reduction, an increase of six Daltons was observed, to 16,183 \u00b1 1 Da (n = 3), matching the theoretical reduced form (Fig. 4a), and confirming the formation of three intra-molecular disulfide bonds. LC-MS peptide mapping (Supplementary Fig. S1) of the reduced and alkylated 6C fragment, utilizing GluC and Trypsin for proteolysis, confirmed 98% of the 6C sequences and no post-translational modifications were identified. These results combined demonstrated that tunicamycin effectively inhibited glycosylation of the non-mutated 6C molecule. Further, the intact mass of 6C-Mut (Fig. 4b) shows the oxidized and reduced form both matched the theoretical mass 16,192 \u00b1 1 Da and 16,198 \u00b1 1 Da (n = 3) with an Asp residue present at the N-terminus.

First, to simply confirm the formation of disulfide bonds, the number of thiol groups exposed on the protein surface was measured. The analysis showed that 6C contains little or no free thiol (<5%) under both native-like and denaturing conditions (with and without 3 M guanidine-HCl), suggesting that all six cysteines were fully oxidized and likely paired by disulfides. Second, to discern the exact pairing of cysteines in the 6C protein, disulfide mapping was performed. The non-reduced and reduced 6C were subjected to an optimized thermolysin digestion method and the resulting peptides were analyzed by LC/MS peptide mapping. Table 1 shows the disulfide linked peptides that supported the pairing of the three disulfide bonds, primarily between Cys298 (C1) and Cys327 (C2), between Cys344 (C3) and Cys412 (C6) and between Cys352 (C4) and Cys410 (C5) along with the predicted theoretical peptide fragments (Table 2). A schematic representation of the amino acid sequence and elucidated disulfide mapping is provided in Fig. 6. This mapped pairing of cysteines for the baculovirus 6C matched the predicted disulfide bonding pattern of the cysteine-rich motif13.",

After EndoH treatment, the N-acetylglucosamine attached to N303 forms H-bonds with D390 and D391 of the 6C molecule. On the other hand, N299 was found not to be glycosylated with the side chain of N299 involved in H bonding with S301. These two N-glycosylation sites (N299 and N303) are not directly involved in the binding of 6C to 85RF45.1, but the results reported here, together with Kundu et al, suggest that amino acid sequence at these sites can play important roles in the proper folding of 6C16.

Subsequently, improved methods were developed using thermolysin digestion which cleaves at the N-terminal of the hydrophobic amino acid residues33. Here, thermolysin cleaved multiple positions between Cys344 and Cys412, including Cys410 and Cys412 at the amino acid residue 411 (isoleucine). As shown in Table 1 and Fig. 6, Cys410(C5) and Cys412 (C6) are isolated to different peptides after thermolysis digestion, allowing us to accurately map the C3 and C6 connection and C4 and C5 connection unequivocally.
