But there are always alarmist people around, maybe that is why sometimes even the most serious warnings may not be heard by the authorities on time. The first patients may be lost without a proper diagnosis. When everybody realizes there may be a big problem in the horizon, sometimes it is too late. That is why it is very important to monitor contagious diseases and follow the warnings and releases of national and international disease control centers and other related organizations. But what happens if they are also late? In terms of COVID-19, the first cases were reported from Wuhan on the last day of 2019. People were celebrating new year all over the world. First the new disease attracts attention of the scientists, medical world, then media and hall world. The number of the cases increased dramatically, and the speed of the curve became high.

In the modern world, people have different preferences. They are less eager to obey the rules, they feel themselves more free or need more freedom, which overall can crush the quarantine procedures easily.

In 2020, International Higher Education Forum, there have been rumors that COVID-19 will cause profound impacts and changes on the higher education system around the world in terms of education-teaching methods, researches, internationalization and mobility. Because of the current outbreak, digital education started to become widespread. The social structure will be able to change in the postpandemic era, too. Many students may prefer online education and distance learning, so will many program directors. But, how it will be then. Schools and universities are not just places for lectures, but the interaction of different people, learning respect to each other and human values, communicating in different circumstances etc. Will the world run to an era that not embraces human values? We will see.",
