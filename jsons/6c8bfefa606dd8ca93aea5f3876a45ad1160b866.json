The health care system is being challenged in the United States and worldwide, and the general public is scared and concerned. Yet through all this, families will continue to give birth and bring new life into the world. As health care providers, we could use this current pandemic to educate the public about the importance of the use of human milk and breastfeeding as lifesaving medical interventions. The purpose of this editorial is to provide guidance regarding breastfeeding and COVID-19 and reaffirm why it is of paramount importance to promote and protect the use of human milk and breastfeeding.",

If separation of the mother and infant is warranted, the mother should start to express milk immediately to establish and maintain milk supply (CDC, 2020). Before expression, the mother should practice hand hygiene (CDC, 2020). After each pumping session, all parts that come into contact with human milk should be washed thoroughly. The breast pump should be appropriately disinfected per the manufacturer's instructions (CDC, 2020) La Leche League International (LLLI) further recommended that if someone who is breastfeeding becomes ill, it is important not to interrupt direct breastfeeding (2020). In such a case, the infant was already exposed to the virus by the mother and/or family and will benefit most from continued direct breastfeeding (LLLI, 2020). Disruption of breastfeeding will increase the risk of the infant becoming ill because of the lack of immune support (LLLI, 2020). If any member of the family has been exposed, the infant has been exposed. Hence, interruption of breastfeeding may actually increase the risk that the infant will become ill (LLLI, 2020).",

Globally, only 41% of infants receive human milk for the first 6 months (United Nations Children's Fund & WHO, 2018). The lack of breastfeeding and exclusive breastfeeding should be considered a public health crisis that we can address by changing the current care paradigm (Spatz, in press ).

In my clinical role, I provide personalized prenatal lactation intervention to families, and they are absolutely fascinated to learn about stem cells, white blood cells, antibodies, lactoferrin, human milk oligosaccharides, and other ingredients and how the milk is specific and tailored for their infants to ensure optimal health and developmental outcomes.",
