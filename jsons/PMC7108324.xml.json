It belongs to human herpesvirus family and infects more than 90% of the world population [2]. EBV exhibits dual tropism, infecting both B lymphocytes and epithelial cells. While infection with the virus during childhood is usually asymptomatic, EBV infection in an adolescent can manifest as infectious mononucleosis (IM) [3], [4]. In immunocompetent individuals, the replication of EBV-infected B cells is kept in check by T cell immunity, driving the virus into dormancy. Nonetheless, the virus is capable of persisting in the human population by restricting expression of viral products to EBV-encoded small RNAs (EBERs) and viral microRNAs (miRNAs), establishing latency 0 profile in the memory B cell pool [5].",

Unlike EBV-associated lymphoid malignancies, the link between EBV and epithelial malignancies is less clear. Although the virus transforms and immortalizes B cell upon infection, the virus does not readily infect epithelial cells, putting forth the contribution of host genetics and environmental factors in EBV-associated NPC. Therefore, it is believed that EBV establishes latency aberrantly in epithelial cells that have already undergone pre-malignant genetic changes [9] as an essential initiation step in the development of NPC. In this article, we will discuss the utility of targeting EBV gene products, the viral episome, and whole virus for research, screening, diagnostic, and future treatment of NPC (Fig. 1\n).",

Apart from its intrinsic function in activating EBV lytic cycle, ZEBRA was shown recently to cross the cell membrane and accumulate in the nucleus of lymphocytes. Specifically, a minimal domain (MD11) consisting of 43 amino acids peptide within the ZEBRA protein was found to be efficient in delivering high molecular weight proteins across the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane via direct, non-endocytosis-dependent translocation [12]. As demonstrated by Marchione et al., the utilization of MD11 permitted high-efficiency (70\u2013100%) delivery of fully biological active cargo proteins within two hours with almost no toxicity. Indeed, using MD11, apoptosis of melanoma and colorectal tumor cells can be observed upon the successful delivery of eIF3f (f subunit of the eukaryotic initiation factor 3) across the cell membrane [13]. Taken together, such EBV peptide-based delivery system presented here could represent a potentially powerful tool in cancer treatment, by facilitating the delivery of coupled therapeutics into cancer cells.",

To overcome this problem, the EBV episome was utilized as the shuttle vector to house large fragments of human genome sequences with size ranging from 60 to 330 kb [16]. The high insert capacity of EBV episomes allows the delivery of intact genomic DNA loci to achieve physiological levels of transgene expression. These constructs known as human artificial episomal chromosomes permit the preservation of the human sequences from deletion, recombination, rearrangement, and facilitated the transfer and recovery between expression systems of different organism. The use of EBV episomes had greatly expedited the process of physical mapping and functional identification of human genes.",

Indeed, rapid and high transgene expression had been achieved with the use of EBV episomes in the absence of drug selection [18], [19], [20]. Coherent with the excellent capacity in accommodating large transgene, the expression of 185 kb human \u03b2-globing transgene had been reported with the stable and sustainable expression for 3 months [20]. Even though high transgene expression can also be achieved with the use of plasmid-based vectors with constitutive promoters such as SV40, CMV, and EF1 promoters, sustainability of the plasmid is always a concern as plasmid often gets diluted upon cell division.",

With the establishment of the mammalian HEK293-EBNA-1 cell line (HEK293E), where parental HEK293 cells stably express EBNA-1, the episomal expression of the transgene resulted in a threefold increase of protein yield [22], [23], [24]. As reported by Backliwal et al., the utilization of HEK293E combined with high-efficient polyethyleneimine-based transfection resulted in a remarkable efficiency of exceeding 1 g/l of recombinant protein [25]. Notebly, production of recombinant protein at the scale of 100 L with 293E adapted suspension culture had been reported by Philippe et al.

In the early days of iPSCs research, the Yamanaka factors were efficiently delivered by engineered retroviruses or lentiviruses. Akin to the drawback as seen with the use of viral vectors in gene therapy, random viral integration warrant safety consideration, making virally-derived iPSCs unsafe for clinical application. As such, the use of integration-free EBV episome for iPSCs reprogramming is preferred and gaining popularity [34], [35], [36]. Actually, iPSCs used for the first historic human trial for macular degeneration were reprogrammed using non-integrative EBV episomal vectors [37].",

The detection of EBV DNA (by PCR) and RNA (EBER-ish) can help when histopathological examination fails in clinically doubtful cases such as occult primaries, submucosal disease and FNAC due to low accuracy. Radiotherapy has been proved to be the most effective modality of treatment if the disease is diagnosed at an early stage, with a 5-year survival probability up to 90%. Unfortunately, 75\u201390% of patients with NPC already have developed local or regional spread upon diagnosis [52]. Therefore, screening for early disease in asymptomatic individuals potentially may improve NPC treatment outcomes. In endemic regions, the presence of EBV will highly suggest NPC. Since the high association with EBV infection, antibodies specific for EBV capsid antigen (IgA/VCA), early antigen (IgA/EA) and plasma DNA have been extensively studied for the screening of NPC. Data from both endemic and non-endemic regions demonstrate plasma DNA can be used for screening, diagnosis, staging, follow-up and prognostication [53], [54], [55], [56]. Chan and Wong [53] recently studied 1318 healthy volunteers and demonstrated that plasma EBV DNA analysis is useful for early detection of NPC before it is clinically evident. Shao et al. [57] proved that plasma EBV DNA detection is a more sensitive and specific marker than the serum IgA/VCA titer for the diagnosis and monitoring of patients with NPC. Besides plasma antibody and DNA, a circulating EBV miR-BART7 and miR-BART13 [58] were shown to serve as potentially new serological biomarkers for diagnosis and prediction of treatment efficacy of NPC. In a very recent study, Zheng et al. demonstrated EBV-encoded mir-bart1-5p detection via a less invasive nasopharyngeal brush sampling can diagnose early-stage NPC with 93.5% sensitivity and 100% specificity [59]. However, all these miRNA detections need large patient cohorts across multiple centers for confirmation.",

The consistent presence of EBV in every cell of undifferentiated NPC provides a unique opportunity to target the virus itself. In endemic region, EBV is exclusively found in NPC tumor cells but not in normal cells [60]. EBV-targeted therapy and immunotherapy have been recently reviewed in detail by many researchers [61], [62] mainly including (1) inhibit the EBV transforming proteins (EBNA-1, LMP1 and LMP2) using antisense RNA, small interfering RNA (siRNA) and ribozyme; (2) induce loss of the EBV episome, e.g. using Hydroxyurea; (3) trigger the lytic form of EBV replication in tumor cells by expressing the IE proteins (Zta or Rta) or using radiation, chemo drugs, demethylation and histone acetylation agents, such as 5-azacytidine, Gemcitabine, HDAC inhibitors, phorbol esters and sodium butyrate. As EBV lytic replication promotes viral antigen exposure and provokes a strong host immune response, the use in conjunction with antiviral prodrug such as ganciclovir further enhances the killing of virus and tumor cells; (4) adopt T cell immune therapy by infusion ex vivo expanded of autologous EBV-specific CTLs from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) [40], [41], [63], [64], (5) active immunotherapy by vaccinating with LMP2 pulsed autologous monocyte-derived dendritic cells or viral vector loading with EBV peptides against LMP1, LMP2 and EBNA-1 [65], [66].",

            "text": "EBV-targeted therapy and immunotherapy represent novel therapies that have currently become a center of interest in research and development of NPC treatment. EBV-targeting therapies have so far no clinical breakthrough yet, although cytolytic virus activation (CLVA) therapy in 3 patients with end-stage NPC showed biological effect, tolerability and moderate safety [67]. Currently, immune-based strategies represent options with the most clinical benefit [68]. While these treatments advancing, knowledge to develop new therapies is emerging. In a genome-wide mutation profiling, we find that NPC has a relatively low level of genomic alteration as compared to other cancers. Therese findings suggest that epigenetic alteration possibly is an oncogenic feature of EBV infection in neoplasia [69]. Hence targeting dysregulated epigenetic regulators might be candidate targets for NPC cancer therapy [70], [71]. Recently the prokaryotic type II CRISPR/Cas9 system has been adapted for genetic engineering in mammalian cells, allowing researchers to edit the genomes with unprecedented speed and precision. This highly precise and versatile system has been used in cancer modeling, cancer genomics functional analyses and cancer drug targets screening [72], [73], [74]. In a proof of concept study, Kanda et al. found that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated cleavage of EBV episomal DNA enabled cloning of disease-associated viral strains with unprecedented efficiency. Two gastric cancer cell-derived novel EBV strains were cloned [75]. The Same technology can accelerate the discovery new EBV strain variants associated with NPC, which will provide important clues about the mechanisms of EBV-mediated epithelial carcinogenesis. In a study of BL patient-derived cells, the clearance of latent EBV genomes using CRISPR-Cas9 leads to proliferation arrest and apoptosis in EBV-infected cells, with no observed cytotoxicity to uninfected cells [76]. The feasibility of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated editing of the EBV genome (EBNA-1, EBNA-3C, LMP1, and BART) has also been demonstrated in cultured NPC cell lines [77]. The dormant viral genome during latent infection provides few therapeutic targets other than itself for antiviral drug development. Thus, this strategy may lead to a generalized approach in curing latent viral infections, although many hurdles remain before this approach could be used in the clinic, such as methods of safe and efficient delivery.",
