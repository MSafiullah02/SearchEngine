Methodology: A prospective descriptive cross-sectional study with a non-probabilistic sampling, in 12 localities of C\u00f3rdoba and Sucre was carried out. Using mist nets capture of the specimens was carried out. The size of the sample was 286 bats, each specimen captured was taxonomically classified. The bats were immobilized with anesthetic and analgesic treatment according to the ethics committee of the University of C\u00f3rdoba, morphometric measurements and blood samples were taken, later they were necropsied in the field to obtain a collection of tissues which were preserved in liquid N 2 \u2212190\u00b0C. The averages of the climatic conditions of the sampling sites were extracted from the WorldClim database (http://www.worldclim.org/). The open source software QGIS (Quantum GIS Development Team.2015) was used to map and visualize bioclimatic regions of C\u00f3rdoba. We used descriptive and retrospective information about the equine population and reports of foci of equine encephalitis. Results: In C\u00f3rdoba and Sucre, 286 bats were captured and 23 species were classified, Artibeus and Phyllostomus discolor were the most frequent captured genus. The geographic ranges of the captured species were variable, some had a wide distribution and others were restricted to some areas. Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus RNA was detected in Artibeus planirostris and Sturnira lilium (2/286 = 0.70%) from Cordoba -Colombia. The univariate descriptive analysis showed no significant association for any of the analyzed variables climatic. Conclusions: Frugivorous bats from the Caribbean area of Colombia may be involved in the Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus enzootic cycle.",

Within this same group are the equine encephalitis viruses of the East and West, Mayaro, Mucambo and Everglades (Zacks and Paessler, 2010; Gardner et al., 2016) . VEEV is an emerging infectious disease in Latin America (Aguilar et al., 2011; Vittor et al., 2016) . The outbreaks have been reported for decades in countries with enzootic circulation, the implementation of surveillance systems has allowed the detection of additional human cases in countries and areas with previously unknown VEEV activity. The enzootic subtypes of VEEV are frequently detected and isolated in ecological habitats, where they circulate in transmission cycles between rodents and mosquitoes. The main vertebrate reservoirs are rodents of wild species of Oryzomys, Zigodontomys, Heteromys, Peromyscus and Proechimys. These animals become infected in nature and develop viremia that is sufficient to infect the vectors (Johnson and Martin, 1974; Deardorff and Scott, 2010) .",

            "text": "Bats, the only flying mammals are abundant and diverse, geographically extended on all continents except at the poles. They provide important eco-systemic services, such as pollination, seed dispersal and insect control among others. However, some bat species are capable of transmitting pathogenic viruses such as rabies and possibly Ebola and coronaviruses. Bats harbor more zoonotic viruses per species than rodents and are now recognized as an important source of zoonotic agents (Luis et al., 2013) . Recently some viruses associated with bats have been identified that are closely related to human pathogens, including hepacivirus, pegivirus (Quan et al., 2013) , influenza A virus (Tong et al., 2012) , hantavirus (Guo et al., 2013) and paramyxoviruses such as mumps and respiratory syncytial virus (Drexler et al., 2012) . Arenavirus (Malmlov et al., 2017) . Bats are also important reservoirs; different studies have reported VEEV infection which suggests that bats could host arboviruses of public health impact in America (Correa et al., 1972; Seymour et al., 1978; Thompson et al., 2015; Sotomayor-Bonilla et al., 2017) . Equines are usually susceptible to the virus and the fatality rate for horses is between 20 to 80% (Gil et al., 2017) . The epidemic/ epizootic types include the IAB and IC subtypes, both of which are responsible for large outbreaks of disease in humans and equines. The other subtypes, or enzootic viruses such as type ID, cause disease in humans and usually do not affect equines (Forrester et al., 2017; Gupta et al., 2017) . Equines can serve as amplifiers of the epizootic form of viruses; and in this way they become the source of infection of thousands of mosquitoes during the febrile period. (Forrester et al., 2017) . Culicidae mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) occupy a preferential position due to their obligate hematophagy, maximum adaptability to multiple environments at different latitudes and altitudes, and a great variability of preferred hosts from which they can feed and in those that can spread the viruses. Some efficient vectors can be arthropods of the genera Aedes, Anopheles, Culex, Mansonia Psorophora and probably Ochlerotatus. The objective of the present study was to study the eco-epidemiology of alphaviruses in bats of departments of C\u00f3rdoba and Sucre, Colombia.",

To avoid animal suffering, Chiroptera were sedated with acetylpromazine-ketamine (0.02 mg / g-0.05 mg / g), then, an euthanasia with an overdose of sodium pentobarbital (200 mg) at a dose of 0.05 mg/g was performed. The necropsy was carried out at the capture site and sample tissues from brain, heart, lung, spleen, liver and kidneys were obtained. Dissections were made at the capture site with the use of biosecurity equipment and materials compulsory for this type of study (Mills et al., 1995) . To preserve the species, specimens in danger of extinction and pregnant or lactating females were released. The tissues and organs were conserved in liquid N2 at \u2212196\u00b0C and transported to the Institute of Biological Research of the Tropics (IIBT) where they were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until molecular analysis was performed.",

The department of C\u00f3rdoba has the second largest equine population in Colombia, this issue is important because the prevention of disease in equines is fundamental through periodic vaccination. The ICA performs surveillance and control of equine encephalitis in susceptible animals through a national official control program and coordinates actions with public health authorities for the prevention of encephalitis in the human population (INS, 2017) . However, despite these controls, cases of equine encephalitis occur throughout the Colombian Caribbean region.

The imbalance in associated ecosystems associated with deforestation, human colonization and urbanization of new areas, could contribute to the emergence of new arbovirus outbreaks. The present study shows the first molecular evidences of the circulation in a natural form of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus in frugivorous non-haematophagous bats A. planirostris and S. lilium that could be hosts of encephalitis virus. A. planisrostris and S. lillium were the first and fourth most abundant species captured in this study, which are considered as species that do not need strict habitat requirements, species of these genera can be found in high-grade ecosystems with anthropic intervention (Soriano, 2000) . The abundance of frugivorous bats in the study areas is due to the C. Guzm\u00e1n, et al. Acta Tropica 191 (2019) 178-184 presence of families of cosmopolitan plants that offer food to these species. In this area there are plants with fruits that serve as food to the frugivorous bats, especially of the Piperaceas, Solanaceas and Cecropiaceas groups, which are common species in human interrupted zones and fragments of forests. These families of plants with fruits coincide with other studies of frugivorous bats in Guatemala and Costa Rica (Howell and Burch, 1974 , L\u00f3pez, 1996 , Lou and Yurrita, 2005 , Ballesteros et al., 2007 , who found that the fruits of the plants of this family are the basis of the diet of the frugivorous bats of Guatemala, Central America and Cordoba, Colombia (Fig. 2) . The 52.17% of frugivorous bats captured were the most abundant trophic group, the variety of families and abundance of specimens, it is because Colombia due to the ecological, climatic and hydric conditions among others, brings as a consequence the mega diversity of species and positions Colombia within the fourteen countries that host the highest index of biodiversity on earth (Andrade, 2011) . The dominant abundance of A. planirostris coincides with the characteristic of the species in terms of diet and habitat use (Medell\u00edn et al., 2000) . Although no association was found between climate variables temperature and precipitation with the presence of natural infection of VEEV and frugivorous bats, ecological work carried out in the study area (Ballesteros and Racero-Casarrubia, 2012) indicated that despite the high degree of human intervention there is abundance of bats.",

There is evidence that some species of mosquitoes can feed on bat blood, although the frequency with which this happens in the field is not well understood and difficult to study (Kading and Schountz, 2016) .",

This description comprised less than 1% of the total number of blood tests of this mosquito species. In Papua New Guinea, Anopheles punctulatus mosquitoes were found to be fed blood from two species of frugivorous bats Dobsonia moluccensis and Dobsonia praedatrix (Logue et al., 2016) . In Uganda, (Karabatsos, 1985; Kading and Schountz, 2016) identified multiple species of frugivorous bats in C. neavei, C. perfuscus fed bat's blood. In the species of mosquitoes C. decens, and Coquillettidia fuscopennata, several pathogenic arboviruses were identified in humans, including the Spondweni virus and ZIKAV of C. neavei (Diallo et al., 2014) .",

            "text": "On the other hand, climate change and the emergence of infectious diseases are the most important ecological problems of our times (Rohr et al., 2011) . In the case of Venezuelan equine encephalitis, mosquitoes are totally dependent on rainfall regimes because they are raised in flooded areas and the size of the population is directly related to the size of the breeding site (Gleiser et al., 2000) . With respect to temperature, this can affect the distribution of the vector, the size of the vector, the feeding habits and the extrinsic incubation period (Lifson, 1996) . In addition, the temperature has a direct effect on the intrinsic rate of growth since it has been observed that at high temperatures, the growth time is accelerated and the mosquitoes became adults faster (Focks et al., 2000) , established a model in which increasing temperature, the females are fed more frequently and the survival rate in the egg stage is reduced. With fewer individuals, there is less larval competition and therefore the females will take better advantage of the resources of the breeding site and may reach a larger size. The main habitats for the principal urban vector species of arboviruses A. aegypti and A. albopictus are propitiated by humans that use water containers for storaging or accumulation of rainwater contribute to population mosquitoes (Morrison et al., 2004) . Some local studies show that there is a relationship between precipitation and the abundance of vectors (Scott et al., 2000; Romero-Vivas, & Falconar, 2005) , however, we were unable to find it.",
