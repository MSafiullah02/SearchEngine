Evidence to date has suggested rapid spread of the virus: at the time of writing, imported cases have been reported in 143 countries and territories, including Singapore. 243 confirmed cases have been reported in Singapore; however, this number is expected to increase substantially in the following weeks. In 2003, SARS-CoV, which also originated from mainland China, established locally, causing 33 deaths after 238 cases were confirmed. Therefore, there is considerable concern since 3204 deaths and 81 048 cases of COVID-19 have already been confirmed in mainland China, which surpasses the numbers observed in the SARS-CoV outbreak. 2020 Lunar New Year celebrations have now ended, marking a period of extensive travel between China and Singapore, and a corresponding high risk for case importation. Despite heightened surveillance and isolation of individuals suspected to have COVID-19 and confirmed cases, the risk is ongoing, with the number of cases continuing to increase in Singapore. Immediate deployment of interventions will be required to contain the outbreak in the event that significant secondary local transmission is observed within the community. We searched PubMed from database inception to Feb 26, 2020, for articles using the search terms \u201cWuhan coronavirus\u201d, \u201cCOVID-19\u201d, \u201cSARS-CoV-2\u201d, \u201c2019-nCoV\u201d, and \u201ccoronavirus interventions\u201d. Our search yielded three relevant articles. Two articles investigated the effects of travel restrictions in Wuhan during the early stages of the outbreak; one of the articles additionally investigated the effects of quarantine in China, and the other article estimated the effectiveness of airport screening for the detection of infected travellers. We found no articles assessing the efficacy of immediate national control measures outside of China.\nAdded value of this study\nThis study is the first to investigate the use of isolation for individuals with COVID-19 and quarantine of family members, school closures, and workplace distancing as interventions for the immediate control of COVID-19 in the event of secondary local transmission using a simulation model. We found that a combined approach (incorporating quarantine, school closures, and workplace distancing) could prevent a national outbreak at low levels of infectivity and reduce the number of total infections considerably at higher levels of infectivity. Such control measures should be deployed in countries outside of China with evidence of imported cases and evidence of local transmission.\nImplications of all the available evidence\nThe results of this study provide policy makers in Singapore and other countries with evidence to begin the implementation of relatively standard outbreak control measures that could mitigate or reduce local transmission rates if deployed effectively and in a timely manner.\n",

Consequently, following the recommendations made by Wu and colleagues,14 modelling studies are needed to estimate the potential impact of interventions in the early phase of the outbreak when uncertainty is highest, which is crucial should local transmission begin to increase.",

The FluTE simulation model requires a synthetic population to build the contact and transmission network. Therefore, we used the geographical, demographic, and epidemiological model of Singapore (hereafter referred to as GeoDEMOS-R, where R represents respiratory illness),16 a modelling framework that aims to recreate a synthetic but realistic representation of the Singaporean population at the household and individual level. We generated the synthetic population using national 2010 census data17, 18 to fit multiple attributes of the population at the household and individual level. The generated households contained demographic characteristics, such as age, marital status, religion, and ethnicity, of household members. Individuals were then allocated to workplaces or educational facilities on the basis of local transportation data and home addresses according to 2010 census data.19 The contact behaviour of individuals in the area of their home (ie, between family members and their local community; defined as the home community), workplace, and school, where applicable, were recorded with potential transmission events as a function of infectivity. We ran the models for 80 days to investigate the early stages of an epidemic and seeded 100 local cases randomly among the resident population at 0 days, representing a few generations of local transmission at the time of scenario implementation (ie, when contact tracing has failed to identify cases within the community and unknown local transmission has started). A full description of the model is available in the appendix (pp 1\u20135).",

Quarantine of infected individuals is expected to occur 1 day after symptom onset in a health-care facility that is assumed to have 3000 beds at maximum capacity (during the early stage of the outbreak) and is fully equipped to handle full quarantine measures (ie, negative pressure isolation rooms, full personal protective equipment use by staff) so that the individual is unable to transmit SARS-CoV-2 to other inpatients. At full capacity, the remaining individuals are isolated at home after receiving treatment. Family members of infected individuals are quarantined at home for 14 days and thus are unable to attend work or school or infect the wider community at their residential address. However, transmission within families is possible as a result of the presence of an isolated and infected individual. Each of these intervention scenarios had 1000 simulations in which we additionally recorded the location of infection as the home community, workplace, or school (appendix pp 3\u20134).",

We calculated IQRs as the 25th and 75th simulation in terms of cumulative case count at 80 days. We used R statistical software (version 3.6.3) to plot graphs and for all analyses.

Geospatially, the number of cases across Singapore at day 80 show a high number of home community infections in highly residential areas and considerable infection-source mixing (figure 3\n; appendix p 11). The combined intervention had the greatest effect on the number of infections, with a universal reduction across Singapore when R\n0 was 1\u00b75 (figure 3). The combined intervention had a smaller effect when R\n0 was 2\u00b70 or 2\u00b75, with a relatively homogeneous distribution nationwide, although dense residential clusters in the north of Singapore, in areas near the Malaysia border, indicate strong comparative persistence of the virus despite the use of the combined approach (figure 3).",

The introduction of cases into new countries, regions and cities is likely to continue in areas where local establishment could form, depending on the ongoing level of control measures. In the event that local containment is unsuccessful, our findings suggest that national outbreak control is feasible provided that R\n0 is low (\u22641\u00b75), with a combination of the proposed intervention measures (quarantine, school closure, and workplace distancing) being most effective. Under this scenario (R\n0=1\u00b75), workplace distancing reduced the median number of cases from 279 000 (IQR 245 000\u2013 320 000) to 4000 (200\u201323 000), as a result of the high employment rates (around 98%) among individuals of working age in Singapore.25 This observation is consistent with the conclusions of a review of 15 studies that found a median reduction of 23% (range 12\u201382) in the cumulative influenza A H1N1 attack rate with workplace distancing alone.26 The implementation of such a control measure, however, is likely to have an acute societal economic effect on individuals who must work from home or take leave, especially if reimbursement is not possible. Thus, decision making becomes a function of risk as to whether the imported cases have or will infect the local population and cause a local outbreak. An R\n0 value of 1\u00b75 is not consistent with the evidence from China,14 and thus prevention of community transmission might not be possible using interventions that would be widely supported by the population.",

School closure has been used in the past in Singapore to limit the spread of hand, foot, and mouth disease, and was associated with a decrease of up to 53% in secondary cases,31 probably because children generally have high contact rates with their peers in the school environment. Given this historical experience, a similar programme for COVID-19 could be established reasonably quickly.

Under this assumption, the median number of cases averted compared with baseline ranged from 219 000 to 282 000 cases (64\u00b74\u201382\u00b79% reduction) depending on the intervention scenario.

Thus, considering the differences in number of cases averted by proportion of asymptomatic individuals in the population, additional interventions, such as vaccination (where research is rapidly ongoing) or the prescribing of existing antiviral drugs that are effective for the treatment of related viral infections, should be considered.

Singapore has one of the highest employment rates among older individuals (aged \u226565 years) of all countries within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)33 and a culture of eating at so-called hawker centres (ie, food courts), with around 75% of people visiting a hawker centre at least once a week.34 Consequently, many older people are expected to be exposed to infection at work or within their home communities, which could be mitigated in part by implementation of workplace distancing and, if possible, incentivisation to remain at home and practise workplace distancing, specifically for older individuals.",

            "text": "At present, the quarantining of family and close contacts of confirmed cases is crucial, as shown by the substantial increase in infection rates among individuals who shared living spaces and bathrooms during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic in China, despite the regular disinfection of these areas.35 The protocols in place at present, including the use of specialist ambulances, negative pressure isolation rooms, and ultraviolet disinfection, will assist in isolating the infection and preventing transmission events at health-care facilities, as was seen during the 2003 SARS outbreak.21 Since at least 15 medical staff in Wuhan have contracted the virus,3 Singapore has provided full personal protective equipment for health-care workers; however, the results of our study suggest that community transmission will substantially contribute to transmission should local containment fail despite these measures. The main control measures at this time are surveillance, standard testing procedures,36 and quarantine of individuals who are confirmed positive for the virus. Such measures have been used in the past for suspected cases of MERS-CoV, which has a 34\u00b74% case-fatality rate,37 with no cases of MERS-CoV reported in Singapore to date, and for Zika virus, which established locally in 2016, with only ten cases reported in 2019.38 Such successes in preventing local outbreaks are attributed to robust disease surveillance in Singapore. Nevertheless, dengue outbreaks are ongoing in Singapore,39 which highlights the difficulties in disease control that are in part due to undocumented spread and individuals who are asymptomatic; these issues are likely to affect the control of the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic since many imported cases worldwide have been asymptomatic on entry to countries.9 The implementation of school closure and workplace distancing can therefore be considered as a potential secondary control response in the event of infection quarantine failure and the establishment of community transmission.",

            "text": "Our study has several limitations. First, since GeoDEMOS-R is validated against census data, errors exist in our estimations of population features that are based on data that have been sample enumerated. Second, a large population of migrant workers who travel from Malaysia to Singapore each day, visiting tourists, and long-term visa owners were not accounted for in our infection dynamics. Third, the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 remain uncertain in terms of the transmission and infectivity profile of the virus; therefore, estimates of the time between symptom onset and admission to hospital, how infectious an individual is over time, and the asymptomatic rate were based on SARS-CoV. Once this information becomes available for COVID-19, a full sensitivity analysis should be done. Fourth, the contact patterns between individuals are highly dynamic and heterogeneous across the population; therefore, our simulated work, school, and home populations serve as a general estimation of infection spread. Fifth, effectiveness of the interventions might vary depending on the ongoing seeding of imported cases, which we did not account for, and will also rely on intervention compliance. Sixth, multiple indirect effects from the interventions and modifications to human behaviour are likely, which are difficult to quantify and measure. The optimum times to implement each intervention and how long they should be run for to achieve long-term epidemic control should be explored. Finally, there are multiple unforeseen factors that remain challenging to assess at this time, such as increased infection rates at mass gatherings, delays in quarantining as a result of individuals not seeking health care at symptom onset, alternate contact events in locations such as public transport, potential transmission events in the health-care setting, and the effects of community-wide behavioural shifts in response to knowledge of the outbreak.",

In this study, we investigated the use of interventions that aim to restrict contact between individuals at important mixing sites: schools, workplaces, and at home. We found that, especially for lower infection scenarios (R\n0 of 1\u00b75), a combined approach comprising quarantine (for infected individuals and their families), school closure, and workplace distancing is effective and could prevent 99\u00b73% of infections (IQR 92\u00b76\u201399\u00b79) when compared with the baseline scenario. At higher infectivity scenarios, outbreak prevention becomes considerably more challenging because although effective, transmission events still occur: for the combined approach scenario, a median of 50 000 cases were estimated at R\n0 of 2\u00b70 and 258 000 cases at R\n0 of 2\u00b75. These combined interventions should therefore be implemented rapidly upon confirmation of second-generation local transmission occurring within the resident population to suppress increases in the national R\n0. At higher asymptomatic rates, public education and case management become increasingly important, with a need to develop vaccines and existing drug therapies.",
