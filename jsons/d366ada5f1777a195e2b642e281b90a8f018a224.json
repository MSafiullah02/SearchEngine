I was prompted to write this Commentary by two headlines and several telephone calls and emails from colleagues and friends. These are the two headlines that recently caught my attention: What we must do to prevent a global COVID-19 depression 1 and COVID-19 could lead to an epidemic of clinical depression, and the health care system isn't ready for that, either. 2 By now there should be little doubt that this pandemic is causing immeasurable economic suffering for many in addition to overwhelming the coping capacities of numerous people. Obviously these two perspectives are intertwined. Yet at present we know nothing about any alterations of emotions or cognitive functioning from direct effects of the virus on the brain per se.",

            "text": "The calls and emails generally were about this last point or about informal advice about how to treat depression in COVID-19 patients. The following describes a composite of several people: A fortyish woman (or man) who is now out of work and sheltering at home says that after many days she is beginning to have trouble concentrating and is feeling little motivation to keep up with household tasks. She is easily frustrated. Her sleep is somewhat fragmented, and she feels drained of energy by late morning. This truncated vignette raises the question of what is depression versus the consequences of what might be called defeat stress (ie, feeling unable to cope with adversity and make thing better). Over the years, I have tried to teach about the importance of making this distinction. 3, 4 Defeat stress can lead to demoralization, a maladaptive response that is not likely to respond to antidepressants. Others have also made this distinction. [5] [6] [7] The COVID-19 pandemic embodies many overwhelming stresses. A few of the obvious ones are loss of employment, deaths of family members, friends, or colleagues, financial insecurity, and isolation from others, particularly for those who live alone. When called upon, clinicians must try to sort out demoralization from depression. Demoralized persons benefit from encouragement and support and from engagement in any efforts that lead to a sense of mastery. Face-to-face contact with qualified mental health professionals is not likely to be readily available to all who need it.",

When those in need have no idea about whom to turn to, one possibility is the Disaster Distress Hotline (1-800-985-5990 or text TalkWithUs to 66746). 8 When I was still treating patients, I used a few observations to support my decision making. If receiving good news or achieving mastery through problem solving or completion of tasks did nothing to lift the spirits of the troubled person and they had other signs and symptoms suggestive of depression, I would then carry out a defined, time-limited trial of an antidepressant about which I was knowledgeable. It is not appropriate for me to discuss the pros and cons of different antidepressants. Although he used the term \"dispiritment,\" George Day provided a charming anecdote that further illustrates the distinction between demoralization and depression. 9 If a dispirited person learned of a large inheritance, it would put him \"right on the pig's back,\" whereas in a seriously depressed person it would add to the guilt and sense of worthlessness.",
