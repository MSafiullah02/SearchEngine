They are anthoxanthins (flavones and flavonols), ketone-containing polyhydroxy polyphenol compounds. More than 5000 natural flavonoids are studied from flora and fauna, classified according to their chemical structure. Flavonoids have been shown to have a wide range of biological and pharmacological activities such as antibacterial [4], antiviral, antifungal [5], antimicrobial, antidiarrheal activities [6], antiinflammatory [7], and antioxidant [8]. Flavonoids show antibacterial potency, synergism with antibiotics along with suppression of virulence factors in bacteria [9].",

Sesterterpenoids, sesquiterpenoids, and meroterpenoids found to be antimicrobial and antiviral are more commonly found in marine environments. Marine sesterterpenoids exhibiting prominent antimicrobial and antiviral bioactivities occur in marine sponges [11]. Seven different types of sesterterpenes sulfates were isolated from tropical sponge belonging to Dysidea sp., of which most were found strong isocitrate lyase inhibitors showing potent antibacterial effect against Bacillus subtilis and Proteus vulgaris\n[12]. Hyrtiosal is a bioactive sesterterpenoid isolated from Hyrtios erectus, which is a marine sponge inhibiting HIV integrase (IN), which binds to viral DNA at a new binding site for inhibitor, observed to bind to HIV N-terminal domain at Ser17, Trp19, and Lys34, having potential application in anti-HIV research [13]. Terpenes possess 1,4-benzoquinone supposed to be responsible for antimicrobial and antiviral properties. Puupehanol, a novel sesquiterpene-dihydroquinone derivative, and chloropuupehenone and puupehenone are responsible for antifungal activity in marine sponge Hyrtios sp. extract [14]. Puupehenone proved most inhibitory against Candida krusei and Cryptococcus neoformans. Nakijiquinones G-I from Okinawan marine sponges, belonging to family Spongilidae, were found to be a sesquiterpenoid quinone with antimicrobial potency [15]. Novel sesquiterpenoid hydroquinones from Dysidea arenaria, a marine sponge, were found moderately inhibitory for enzyme HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) [16]. Peyssonoic acids A and B, novel sesquiterpene hydroquinones, with a novel carbon skeleton, isolated from crustose marine red alga Peyssonnelia sp [17] were found inhibitory for bacterial pathogen Pseudoalteromonas bacteriolytica in marine algae and Lindra thalassiae, a fungal pathogen of marine algae.",

Two pyrroloiminoquinone alkaloids of class discorhabdin from sponge Sceptrella sp. from Gageodo, Korea [33] showed antibacterial potency, especially against enzyme sortase A, with a key role in anchoring of cell wall protein responsible for S. aureus virulence. 19-oxofasciospongine A and fasciospongine C (sulfated sesterterpene alkaloids) and 25-hydroxyhalisulfate 9 (sesterterpene sulfate), found recently and known sesterterpenes sulfates halisulphates 7 and 9, have been extracted from marine sponge Fasciospongia sp. organic extract [34], showed strong inhibitory hyphae - formation efficiency against Streptomyces 85E. Chinese marine sponge Iotrochota baculifera showed the presence of sulfated alkaloids baculiferins A-O and O-sulfated pyrrole alkaloids [35]. Of these, Baculiferins C, E \u2013 H, K\u2013N efficiently inhibited HIV IIIB, by binding to targets viral infectivity factor (Vif), cellular deoxycytidine deaminase APOBEC3G and recombinant gp41, a trans-membrane protein. Caribbean sponge Monanchora unguifera shows the presence of guanidine alkaloids which are polycyclic with significant antimicrobial and antiviral properties [36] and batzelladine alkaloids like batzelladines K, L, M, N; 16 \u03b2-hydroxycrambescidin 359, ptilomycalin A, batzelladine C, crambescidine 800, and dehydrobatzelladine C with significant inhibitory activities against HIV and opportunistic pathogens of Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). Merobatzelladines A, B isolated from this marine sponge is antibacterial [37]. Marine sponge Aaptos aaptos possesses alkaloid 4-methylaaptamine which shows inhibition against HSV-1 replication and antiherpetic activity [38]. Four aaptamines from A. aaptos show inhibitory activity against enzyme sortase A which is involved in S. aureus virulence and anchoring of cell wall protein [39]. Topsentin and hamacanthin are antimicrobial bisindole alkaloids isolated from marine sponge Spongosorites sp [40]. Dysideanins A and B from marine sponge Dysidea sp. are found to have antimicrobial potency [41]. 5-hydroxyindole-type alkaloids from Hyrtios sp. Sponges from tropical regions exhibited inhibitory potency against isocitrate lyase in C. albicans\n[42]. A family of alkaloids isonitrile-containing indole alkaloids, such as hapalindoles, have fused pentacyclic and hexacyclic carbon skeletons from cyanobacteria, are contemplated for use in pharmaceuticals. Fischambiguines A and B, ambiguine P, ambiguine Q nitrite, ambiguine G nitrite were isolated and identified from Fischerella ambigua\n[43]. Fischambiguine B showed anti\u2013Mycobacterium tuberculosis activity. Diketopiperazine alkaloids are marine antimicrobial alkaloids. A marine halotolerant fungal strain - Alternaria raphani from sea salt fields showed the presence of cerebrosides, alternarosides A, B, C, and diketopiperazine alkaloid, alternarosin A [44], which show weak antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and C. albicans. Caboxamycin produced by deep-sea Streptomyces sp. NTK937 showed inhibitory activity against Gram-positive bacteria [45].",

Antiviral cyclic depsipeptides - mirabamides A, B, C, D are isolated from sponge Siliquariaspongia mirabilis\n[48], probably preventing HIV fusion. Mirabamides are composed of 4-chloromoproline in 1, 2, 3 positions, \u03b2-methoxytyrosine 4\u2032-O-\u03b1-l-rhamnopyranoside (unusual glycosylated amino acid) in 1, 2, 4 positions and rare N-terminal aliphatic hydroxy acid. Mirabamide A, C, D is found to inhibit HIV acting at entry stage of HIV. Mirabamides A, B, C inhibit Bacillus subtilis and C. albicans. Alternaramide, a cyclic depsipeptide from the marine fungus Alternaria sp. SF-5016 [49] exhibited weak anti S. aureus and anti Bacillus subtilis activity. Homophymine A, a cyclodepsipeptide from marine sponge Homophymia sp [50]. showed anti - HIV cytoprotective potency. Homophymime A is composed of 11 amino acids, an amide-linked-3-hydroxy-2, 4, 6-trimethyloctanoic acid molecules; four Dextro, two Levo, one N-methyl amino acids and four unusual amino acid residues. Callyaerins A, B, C, D, E, F and H are antiviral and antimicrobial peptides from marine sponge Callyspongia aerizusa\n[51]. Theonellamides are bicyclic peptides from marine sponges which show antifungal activities [52]. Aminolipopeptides, Trichoderins A, A1 and B, are marine antimicrobial peptides from sponge - derived fungus of Trichoderma sp. They show antimycobacterial activity versus dormant and active marine bacilli [53], especially against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, M. Smegmatis and M. bovis. Anthranilic acid and dehydroamino acid units, sclerotides A and B, components of cyclic hexapeptides obtained from marine halotolerant Aspergillus sclerotiorum PT06-1\n[54] exhibited antibacterial and antifungal activities. Aspergillus sclerotiorum PT06-1 was found to contain cyclic tripeptides scleraotiotides A-K of aspochracin nature [55]. Sclerotiotides A, B, F, I showed antifungal activity for C. albicans. Maribasins A and B cyclic lipopeptides, from marine Bacillus marinus B-9987 showed broad-spectrum activity against phytopathogens [56]. Two antifungal lipopeptides on eof which is the rare 6-Abu fengycin lipopeptides from marine Bacillus amyloliquefaciens SH-B10\n[57] showed remarkable inhibitory potency against five phyto-fungal pathogens, suggesting bio-control and sustainable agricultural practicese. Tauramamide, lipopeptide from marine bacteria Brevibacillus laterosporus PNG276\n[58] along with ethyl ester 3, showed selective inhibitory activity against pathogenic species of Enterococcus. Thiopeptides and depsipeptides are marine bacterial antimicrobial peptides found in Nocardiopsis sp. TP-1161\n[59], possessing a unique aminoacetone group. Unnarmicine A and C, marine depsipeptides from Photobacterium MBIC06485 [60] selectively killed two Pseudovibrio species, commonly existing in marine environment. Hybrid forms of marine peptide polyketide-nonribosomal antimicrobial agents from Myxobacteria have been isolated. One example is halophilic myxobacterium Paraliomyxa miuraensis, producing miuraenamides A and B which are hybrid cyclic polyketide-peptide antimicrobial agents [61]. Two rare hybrid polyketide-nonribosomal linear peptide antibiotics, Ariakemicins A and B found in marine gliding bacterium Rapidithrix species [62], are found to be composed of two \u03a9-amino-(\u03a9-3)-methyl carboxylic acids with diene or triene units, threonine and \u03b4-isovanilloylbutyric acidand inhibited particularly Gram-positive bacterial growth. Nonribosomal peptides from marine Brazilian cyanobacterial isolates are antimicrobial [63], while from Brevibacillus laterosporus Lh-1 exhibit antimicrobial activity for fungi and Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria [64].",

About 40 antiviral substances from marine species have been reported, half of which have shown prospects in treatment of HIV infection. On this background, marine sponges, sources of novel antivirals, may prove to be good therapeutic agents [168]. Avarol inhibits HIV infection progression and increases humoral immune response. Avarol in 0.3, 0.9 \u03bcM concentration inhibited 50%, 80% of viruses, respectively, released by infected cells [169]. Avarol derivatives, 6\u2032-hydroxyavarol and 3\u2032-hydroxyavarone, strongly inhibit HIV reverse transcriptase in HIV. Avarol converts viral genomic RNA to proviral DNA and integrates it in host chromosomal DNA [170]. Various antiviral marine metabolites are currently under clinical trial.",

Although costs required for developing drugs from marine sources have been exorbitant, development of new technology and better understanding of marine species and associated ecosystem has helped us in developing research in the area of drug development. Bright future awaits pharmaceutical industry for developing new drugs from antimicrobial lead compounds obtained from marine sources. The progress is slow, but surely drug manufacturing units have started showing interest in implementing natural marine sources for drug developing. A future trend is developing in research today, positively toward use of marine natural resources. There are ample of marine lead compounds, more than imagined [192].",

Avarol, obtained from sponge D. avara sponge, is an efficient drug for treatment of HIV [169], which could not be available for studies further than preclinical ones because of its low availability for assessment [194]. Another advantage of marine species metabolites is that their carbon skeletons can be used as carriers or vehicles for generating efficient derivatives. Mankind now faces a challenge of preparing the miracle drugs in large quantities, transforming bioactive metabolites to medicines by selecting proper marine species, isolating the correct metabolite, with its precise action and its target point toward a disease.",
