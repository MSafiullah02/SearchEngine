The economic impact of PRRS alone to the US swine producers has been estimated to be approximately $560 million annually [1]. According to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) report of January 2009, overall, 49.8% of unvaccinated grower/finisher pigs were positive for PRRSV antibodies in the US (http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/nahms/swine/downloads/swine2006/Swine2006_is_PRRS.pdf). As a member of the Arteriviridae family, PRRSV contains a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome [2]. PRRSV causes respiratory distress in pigs of all ages and reproductive failure in sows [3], [4]. Infection with this virus results in suppression of innate immune response (reduced IFN-\u03b1 production and NK cell cytotoxicity) and a delay in the onset of adaptive immune response [5], [6], [7].",

Currently, modified live and inactivated PRRSV vaccines have been licensed for use; however, these vaccines are not always efficacious in preventing PRRSV reinfections and transmission. There continue to be questions regarding vaccine safety and efficacy against existing as well as emerging antigenically heterologous PRRSV strains [9], [10]. Therefore, development of a broadly protective PRRSV vaccine has been a challenge to PRRSV researchers. Recently, PRRSV experts and researchers collectively agreed that only replicating PRRSV vaccines have the most promise in the field and successful protection can be achieved by improving the efficacy of live PRRSV vaccines (http://vetmed.illinois.edu/news/PRRSwhitepaper.pdf).",

            "text": "Mucosal surfaces cover the largest surface area in the body and almost 80% of total immune cells in the body are localized in the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues (MALT) and at mucosal sites. Nasopharyngeal MALT contains the entire repertoire of immune cells which are strategically located to orchestrate regional immune functions against airborne infections [11]. A majority of pathogens are transmitted through mucosal surfaces, but some of them cause disease primarily at these mucosal sites (e.g. Influenza, PRRSV, HIV, Rotavirus, etc.). It has been demonstrated that systemic stimulation of the immune system mainly results in systemic protection with low mucosal immune responses. Conversely, optimal stimulation of the mucosal immune system generates both mucosal and systemic immunity [12]. The mucosal immune system possesses strong immunoregulatory mechanisms to dampen inflammation-induced pathology; therefore, mucosal immunization generally results in tolerance in the absence of suitable adjuvants or delivery systems [13], [14]. Intranasal delivery of live attenuated vaccines against bovine herpes virus-1, influenza, and parainfluenza-3 when administered with adjuvants has proven effective [15], [16]. Intranasal delivery of influenza vaccine with a potent adjuvant resulted in effective cross protection due to immune responses generated against conserved internal viral proteins [17]. Thus, mucosal immunization may be an attractive method to induce PRRSV specific cross-protective immunity.",

Heat-killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) in an oil emulsion has been used extensively for experimental purposes as complete Freund's adjuvant [18]. Unfortunately, adverse effects mediated by major cell wall components of Mtb such as mycolic acids, peptidoglycan, and wax D preclude use of complete Freund's adjuvant in humans and food animals [19], [20]. Adjuvanticity of various purified individual components of Mtb have been investigated [21], [22], including water soluble whole cell lysate (WCL) of Mtb\n[23]. Interestingly, a few of the Mtb WCL fractions, such as heat shock protein-70 (HSP70) [21], [24] and PE (Pro-Glu)/PPE (Pro-Pro-Glu) have been identified to elicit potent adjuvant activity [25], [26].

The swine herd was confirmed seronegative for antibodies to PRRSV, porcine respiratory corona virus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus, and porcine circo virus 2. Piglets were bled on arrival, and the sera were tested to confirm the absence of PRRSV antibodies. Pigs were allowed to acclimate for an additional week before initiation of the experiment. Animals were maintained in the large animal BSL-2 facility under the supervision of a veterinarian. Throughout the duration of the study, all animals received food and water ad libitum. All inoculations such as adjuvant (Mtb WCL, 3 mg/pig), vaccine (PRRS-MLV, 2 \u00d7 106\n TCID50 per pig) and challenge (PRRSV, 1 \u00d7 106\n TCID50 per pig) were administered intranasally. Adjuvant and vaccine were inoculated separately into each nostril.

PRRSV induces a strong immunosuppressive response resulting in the delayed onset of cell mediated immune responses [6], [43], [44], [45]. Both live and inactivated PRRSV significantly increase IL-10 gene expression [45]. An increased concentration of IL-10 in pig lungs was detected from PRRSV-infected pigs for long periods of time [6], [43]. Nonetheless, expression of both IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 genes was also increased in pigs vaccinated against PRRSV by a systemic route [46]. In our pre-challenge study, increased secretion of both IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 in both the lungs and blood of pigs vaccinated intranasally with PRRS-MLV without Mtb WCL was detected [27]. In contrast, in both pre- and post-challenge studies when PRRS-MLV was inoculated intranasally with Mtb WCL, secretion of both IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 was suppressed.",

The role of Tregs in establishment of chronic persistent HIV, hepatitis C and B viruses, cytomegalovirus, and Epstein\u2013Barr virus infections has been reported [48], [49], [50]. Like in mice and humans, Foxp3-expressing CD4+CD25+ cells with comparable immunosuppressive properties have been identified in pigs [38]. Studies have been reported on the PRRSV mediated proliferation of Tregs in infected pigs, indicating their involvement in disease progression [51], [52], [53]. In our study, a consistently reduced frequency of Tregs in the lungs, blood, and TBLN of pigs vaccinated intranasally with PRRS-MLV+ Mtb WCL was detected which was associated with reduced secretion of both the immunosuppressive cytokines, IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2. Co-ordinated immunosuppressive functions of IL-10, TGF-\u03b2, and Tregs have been reported [54], [55]. PRRSV increases the expression of TGF-\u03b2 from myeloid cells, and TGF-\u03b2 is essential for the de novo induction of Foxp3 and for the regulation of differentiation and function of Tregs in mice, humans, and pigs [52], [56].",

Pigs (three each) were inoculated intranasally with mock, PRRS-MLV, or PRRS-MLV+ Mtb WCL and then vaccinated pigs were challenged with MN184 at DPI 21 and euthanized at DPC 30. (A) Serum collected at indicated DPC were analyzed for PRRSV specific VN titers by a standard immunofluorescence assay. Supernatants harvested from lung MNC and PBMC cultures restimulated using killed MN184 Ags were analyzed for cytokines: (B) IFN-\u03b3; (C) IL-12; (D) IL-10 by ELISA. Each bar represents the average values from three pigs \u00b1 SEM. Asterisk denotes a statistically significant difference (P < 0.05) between PRRS-MLV vs. PRRS-MLV+ Mtb WCL received and PRRSV challenged pigs.",
