            "text": "Social media discussion of COVID-19 provides a rich source of information into how the virus affects people's lives that is qualitatively different from traditional public health datasets. In particular, when individuals self-report their experiences over the course of the virus on social media, it can allow for identification of the emotions each stage of symptoms engenders in the patient. Posts to the Reddit forum r/COVID19Positive contain first-hand accounts from COVID-19 positive patients, giving insight into personal struggles with the virus. These posts often feature a temporal structure indicating the number of days after developing symptoms the text refers to. Using topic modelling and sentiment analysis, we quantify the change in discussion of COVID-19 throughout individuals' experiences for the first 14 days since symptom onset. Discourse on early symptoms such as fever, cough, and sore throat was concentrated towards the beginning of the posts, while language indicating breathing issues peaked around ten days. Some conversation around critical cases was also identified and appeared at a roughly constant rate. We identified two clear clusters of positive and negative emotions associated with the evolution of these symptoms and mapped their relationships. Our results provide a perspective on the patient experience of COVID-19 that complements other medical data streams and can potentially reveal when mental health issues might appear.",

The authors give the posts labels, or \"flairs\", that represent their relationship with COVID-19. Of particular interest in this work are the flairs reserved for those who have tested positive, \"Tested Positive -Me\" and \"Tested Positive\". Often, these posts are in the form of daily journal entries, where references to specific days of the author's experiences after developing symptoms are made. We exploit this structure to annotate the text within posts having relevant flairs by this reference date using regular expressions. As this annotation is relative to the onset of symptoms for each infectious patient, grouping by day number can then reveal common themes in discourse at particular stages in experiences with COVID-19. We perform topic modelling to reveal common themes in the symptoms described at different stages of illness, and sentiment analysis to reveal how patients feel during each of these stages. By correlating the trends of each over time, we connect patients' descriptions of their symptoms to their emotions. Using this information in conjunction with traditional evidence-based medical studies provides a different understanding of the stages of COVID-19 illness, hopefully giving medical practitioners and policymakers new tools to respond to this ongoing crisis.",

It was observed that journal-formatted posts fall into two main categories for describing dates, using the format \"Day x\" to describe the number of days since testing positive, or with real dates. We make the assumption that any post follows only one of these formatting rules. In the latter case we set \"Day 1\" to be the first date mentioned, and as follows for subsequent dates. Before there is a reference to a day or date, we annotate the text by Day: NA. An exception to this is made when a title mentions a specific day. If it does, we instead annotate this text by that day. If neither the \"Day x\" format, nor the absolute date format is detected, we discard the post as it does not contribute to our understanding of the collective timeline. Table 1 summarises the number of posts meeting these formats. The number of annotations for the number of days since developing symptoms is displayed in Figure 1 . A considerable number of posts (57.5%) mention the first day of symptom onset ( Figure 1) . A sharp decrease in the number of posts is observed for the second day (18.5%). There is a small decrease in the number of posts after the first week, followed by a more rapid decrease in the number of posts over the next two weeks. By the third week, there are few posts for each day; however, the decrease from this point is slight, resulting in a heavy tail. After 40 days, the number of posts becomes negligible. We omit one post from Figure 1 that occurred at Day 150. In total, after preprocessing, there were 292 posts from 223 unique authors, averaging 1.31 posts per author. There were 966 mentions to specific days, with each user referencing 4.33 days on average. These mentions to specific days, as well as the preliminary text at the start of a post before a day mention (for which we annotate as Day: NA), split the posts into 1,179 documents for the purpose of our analysis.",

One cause for this may lie in testing for COVID-19, resulting in discourse around medical terminology.

The increase thereafter may be attributed to the breathing difficulties identified in Topic 3, escalating the condition to hospital.

We remark that the placement of topics near sentiments in Figure 5 does not imply that they necessarily pertain to that sentiment, merely, they correlate well with it. surprise trust q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q ",

In particular, while a global platform, its user base is largely North American [25] , and so we should expect that these results are largely describing a North American experience of the virus. It is also clear that, similar to other forms of social media such as Twitter [26] , there will also be significant demographic biases, on Reddit towards younger, more educated, politically-liberal, users [27] . We also acknowledge there is a quite literal survivorship bias present. Clearly, people who have passed away due to COVID-19, and those in critical cases will be unable to post about their experiences. There is an avenue to explore these cases through the flair \"Tested Positive -Family\" that future research may consider.",

This is in contrast to traditional evidence-based medicine, which de-emphasises anecdotal reports [12] . Moreover, there is no way to ensure authors posting under the flair \"Tested Positive -Me\" and \"Tested Positive\" did in fact test positive for COVID-19. There will also be inconsistencies to the day the authors define as Day 1. In this analysis we remark that this day is the first day of symptom onset, however, some authors may refer to Day 1 as the first day since testing positive. This would be especially true in the case of an asymptomatic person who tested positive. Together, these form considerable limitations towards the reliability of the narratives, and hence the resulting analysis. We, therefore, advise caution when interpreting this analysis, and that these limitations are kept in mind. On the other hand, this remains an important corpus for study, partly due to its visibility -that these narratives are publicly posted means they are potentially more influential in the broader media than truly personal diaries.",

It is conceivable that after topic modelling, we duplicate the results for each day in the range mentioned.

Topics containing terms such as \"breathing\", \"chest\", \"lungs\", indicating more serious conditions, appear more frequently in later stages of the timeline. Sentiment analysis revealed a high level of negativity and fear in these narratives. The relationships between topics and sentiments are explored through their Pearson correlations.

The development of more sophisticated, context specific sentiment analysis will better capture how we feel towards COVID-19 and how it affects our mental health. Improvements to the data preprocessing such as annotation of dates will improve the signal-to-noise ratio, and yield a more accurate and reliable analysis. Similarly, the collection of future narratives yet to be told will improve the sensitivity of the analysis, and allow further techniques to be used. Furthermore, the assimilation of data relating to this pandemic with future epidemics and/or pandemics will permit similar analyses comparing social media responses to be conducted.",
