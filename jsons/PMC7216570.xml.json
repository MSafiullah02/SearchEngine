Regenerative Agriculture can best be described as managing landscapes to enable the self-organizational healing of complex-adaptive, natural systems. Nutrient-rich, healthy food-systems can then evolve. For all species, not just humans, these systems produce food that is the very opposite of the nutrient-bereft, chemically-tainted foods of the industrial food system: a system fundamentally complicit in the exponentially rising graphs of modern human diseases.",
