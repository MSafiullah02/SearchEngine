Administration of the oxidant, tert-butylhydroperoxide (tert-buOOH) to the perfusate of isolated rabbit lungs causes pulmonary vasospasm [16]. Oxidant-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction can be blocked by the cyclooxygenase or thromboxane synthase inhibitor, indomethacin and is closely correlated with the thromboxane level in the effluent perfusate [13, 16\u201319], suggesting a critical role of thromboxane in pulmonary vasoconstriction. On the other hand, TMB-8, an intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) antagonists, has been shown to prevent oxidant-mediated pulmonary vasoconstriction [13]. Thus, oxidant-mediated PAH is triggered by an increase in [Ca2+]i. In many occasions PAH occur due to an increase in [Ca2+]i caused by stimulants such as thromboxane A2 and endothelin-1 that generates oxidants. Oxidant and Ca2+ ionophore-mediated pulmonary hypertension has been observed to be inhibited by serine protease inhibitors, for example, aprotinin [19\u201321].",

            "text": "The mechanism by which oxidants stimulate production of the arachidonic acid (AA) metabolites has gained considerable interest. A report by Chakraborti et al. [22] indicated that oxidants, e.g., tert-buOOH stimulation of pulmonary artery endothelial and smooth muscle cells caused a marked increase in phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity with subsequent generation of AA. Mepacrine, an inhibitor of PLA2 inhibits tert-buOOH-induced increase in PLA2 activity, thromboxane B2 production, and PAH [19, 22]. Some investigators, considering the analogy of activation of pancreatic phospholipase A2 [23], suggested that a serine protease might be involved in regulating PLA2 activity [24]. Chakraborti et al. [25, 26] demonstrated that oxidant-mediated activation of PLA2 activity in pulmonary endothelial and smooth muscle cells occur with the involvement of proteolytically activated protein kinase C\u03b1 (PKC\u03b1). They have also demonstrated that oxidants caused increase in [Ca2+]i in pulmonary endothelial and smooth muscle cells can activate an aprotinin sensitive protease having mol mass of ~43 kDa [26]. The protease then proteolytically activates PKC\u03b1 resulting in stimulation of cPLA2 (Fig. 1), which generates thromboxane and that has been observed to be important in producing PAH [25, 26]. Oxidants elicit an increase in [Ca2+]i due to proteolytic activation of PKC-\u03b4 by MMP-2 resulting in phosphorylation of a pertussis toxin sensitive protein (Gi) leading to inhibition of Na+ dependent Ca2+ uptake (Na+/Ca2+ exchanger) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [27\u201331] (Fig. 2), whereas the role of cell membrane for an increase in [Ca2+]i has been observed to be due to phosphorylation of G\ni via proteolytically activated PKC\u03b1 by an aprotinin sensitive serine protease leading to inhibition of Na+ dependent Ca2+ efflux (Na+/Ca2+ exchanger) (Fig. 1) in pulmonary vascular cells [24\u201326].\n\n",

In heart sarcolemmal vesicles, Ca2+ uptake via NCX produces maximum transport velocity and that has been demonstrated to be about 30-fold up than that elicited by the sarcoplasmic reticulum {S(ER)} Ca2+ pump system [33]. In addition to the Ca2+ pump, Na+ dependent Ca2+ uptake system is an important mechanism to sequester Ca2+ in the ER of pulmonary vascular cells [29\u201333]. A decrease in Ca2+ sequestration by proteolytic inhibition of Na+ dependent Ca2+ uptake has been observed to measure duration of free [Ca2+]i transient, which eventually produces vasoconstriction [34, 35]. In different systems, Na+/Ca2+ exchanger controls the contractility of smooth muscle cells [34, 35]. For example, contractile dysregulation in the myocardium could be related with activation of proteases [36]. Thus, the role of cell membrane associated aprotinin sensitive protease and ER MMP-2 on Na+/Ca2+ exchange in pulmonary artery endothelial and smooth muscle cells under oxidant triggered condition is an important mechanism for the pathological manifestation of pulmonary vasoconstriction [24\u201326, 29\u201331].",

Remodeling of pulmonary artery is associated with an alteration of extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover with concomitant change in ECM proteins level. In PAH, dysregulation of ECM turnover has been suggested to play an important role in the pathological remodeling process [35, 36]. ECM degradation occurs by different proteases of which matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) has been shown to play the crucial role [37, 38]. Of the MMPs, MMP-2, and MMP-9 are able to cleave basement membrane associated type IV collagen, which increase remodeling of the pulmonary vasculature in PAH [39]. Given the potency of MMPs, its activity is tightly regulated at the transcriptional and post-translational level, where the tissue inhibitors of MMP (TIMPs) play a pivotal role [40, 41].",

It has been observed that the activation of proMMP-2 occurs at the cell membrane. Interaction between MT1-MMP and TIMP-2 is an important phenomenon in the activation of proMMP-2. The MT1MMP-TIMP2 associates with proMMP-2 and forms a trimolecular complex, which triggers the activation of proMMP-2 and subsequently generates MMP-2 [41, 42]. The activation of proMMP-2 in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells occur with the involvement of protein kinase C-\u03b1 dependent and NF-\u043aB-MT1MMP-mediated signaling mechanism. TNF-\u03b1 augments mRNA and protein expression of MT1MMP, while the expression level of TIMP-2 diminishes. The increase in TNF-\u03b1 leads to IKK activation, IB phosphorylation and degradation, and subsequently activation of NF-\u043aB. Upon activation, NF-\u043aB binds to the MT1-MMP promoter, thereby enhancing its expression and subsequently increases proMMP-2 level in association with TIMP-2 that is modulated by protein kinase C-\u03b1 at the cell membrane [41, 42] (Fig. 3). This indicates therapeutic potentiality of PKC inhibitors in ameliorating the PAH, where activation of proMMP-2 is an important phenomenon.\n",

Four PARs (PAR1-4) are known to be activated by different proteases. After cleavage of the receptor(s) by proteases, the newly released amino terminal sequence binds and internally activates the receptor [67].

PR3 and CatG, two elastase homologues secreted in massive quantities from neutrophils at inflammatory sites, have also been shown to have proinflammatory functions acting through various mechanisms [80\u201382]. The most abundant is the \u03b11-PI, which targets preferentially HNE. Secretory leukoprotease inhibitor (SLPI), an inhibitor of HNE and CatG, but not of PR3, has been shown to control excess proteolysis in the upper airways [83]. Elafin, derived from trappin-2 (pre-elafin) [84], is an NSP inhibitor that controls the activities of HNE and PR3 [85]. Other NSP inhibitors including 1-antichymotrypsin and monocyte/NE inhibitor (MNEI) were found to play relatively minor role as protease inhibitors [86, 87]. NSPs, therefore, could prove useful as therapeutic target for a number of inflammatory lung diseases.",

Granzymes, a family of serine protease, have a repute to initiate immune-mediated cell death. Cytotoxic T cells and natural killer (NK) via granzyme-mediated pathway induces apoptosis of target cells, e.g., bronchial epithelial cells. Granzymes play critical roles in a variety of age-related chronic inflammatory diseases. There are five human granzymes identified so far in the lungs. These are granzyme A (GzmA-tryptase), granzyme B (GzmB-aspase), granzyme H (GzmH-chymase), granzyme K (GzmK-tryptase), and granzyme M (GzmM-metase). Granzymes, especially granzyme B and perforin, are stored in secretory granules of cytotoxic cells, and are released into the intercellular space following adhesion to the target cells. In presence of Ca2+, perforin pores in the cell membrane enable entry of granzyme B and subsequently induces caspase-dependent apoptosis [155], which may be an important mechanism of lung injury in asthma.",

Asthmatic patients allergic to pollen have been observed to develop a chronic inflammation of the airways leading to bronchial obstruction and hyper responsiveness. Upon inhalation, pollen grains release a wide variety of allergens with protease activities, which may act as inflammatory mediators and subsequently pathogenesis of respiratory allergies. The proteases were known to inactivate lung regulatory neuropeptides, for example, substance P and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) [164] leading to dysregulation of the contraction-relaxation rhythm of the respiratory airways. The inhaled allergens were processed by dendritic cells (DCs) present at the subepithelial regions, and then present allergen peptides to native T-lymphocytes for stimulation of IgE production. Some pollen allergens exhibit proteases such as aminopeptidase and trypsin-like serine protease activities, which can cleave proteins from junctional complexes between epithelial cells [165]. A 98 kDa aminopeptidase of Parietaria judaica, for instance, has been shown to cause detachment of A549 human alveolar epithelial cells by degrading intercellular adhesion proteins from tight junctions and adherens junctions [165, 166]. Pollen proteases can induce degradation of cell junction proteins such as occluding, claudin-1 and E-cadherin, thereby help allergens to cross the epithelial barrier and contact with DCs for intensifying immune response [164\u2013166].",

In lung epithelial cells, actions of fungal, cockroach and dust mite allergen proteases are mediated by the cleavage and activation of protease activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) [174\u2013176]. However, PAR-1 is unable to mediate the effects of these proteases. PARS play an important role in bronchial fibroblast proliferation; epithelial cell wound healing and hypersecretion of mucus [177, 178]. By inhibiting HDE proteases or abrogating activation of epithelial cells, PAR-2 could inhibit HDE-induced inflammatory indexes in bronchial epithelial cells (BECs) and subsequently inhibition of the allergic response [179]. Thus, targeting the protease activity of organic dusts made for agricultural usage and other air borne dusts may prove useful as a strategy for preventing airway inflammation in agricultural workers, who are generally exposed to dusty agricultural environments.",

In human cancer cells, HtrA1 over expression prevents cancer cell growth and proliferation suggesting HtrA1 as a tumor suppressor. A modest expression of HtrA1 has been observed in primary tumors and lymph node metastases. However, the exact functions of HtrA1 in cancer are mostly unknown. A previous report suggested that HtrA1 elicits its function by inhibiting TGF-\u03b2 pathway [199]. The role of TGF-\u03b2 in cancer progression is well documented [200]. Accordingly, the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway has been considered as both a tumor suppressor and promoter pathway of tumor progression and invasion. It, therefore, seems probable that activation of TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway occurs when HtrA1 is downregulated, thereby contributing to the cancer progression. Alternatively, over expression of HtrA1 has been shown to induce apoptosis [201]. Thus, loss of HtrA1 expression alters regulation of apoptosis and could lead to cancer progression [201].",

XRE is located in the promoter region of the genes involved in metabolizing xenobiotic carcinogens, mainly aryl hydrocarbons from cigarette smoke and environmental pollutants, for instance, automobile exhaust [208, 209]. These compounds upregulate the gene products of XRE via aryl hydrocarbon receptors and multitude of other transcription factors [210, 211]. The degree of methylation of HtAr3 is similar when studied in A549 and H157 lung epithelial cells, when treated with NNK (Nicotine-derived nitrosamine ketone), a.k.a 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone, an important tobacco-specific nitrosamines, which play key role in carcinogenesis [208]. NNK suppressed the expression of HtAr3, whereas 5-azo-dc has been shown to induce it [208]. Differential expressivity of HtAr3 may be controlled by other cross-talking mechanisms such as histone deacetylation, micro RNA activation, loss of heterozygosity and genetic mutation. Along with that HTAr3, HtAr1, and HtAr2 are also believed to be upregulated by xenobiotic stress [208, 212].

Under physiological conditions, lungs are protected from this enzyme by endogenous inhibitors such as \u03b11-PI, \u03b12-macroglobulin, and SLPI. However, in the course of ALI, the balance between elane and its endogenous inhibitors is disregulated in favor of the enzyme [242\u2013244] leading to massive infiltration of neutrophils into the lungs and subsequently tissue injury. Therefore, peptidic and non-peptidic elane inhibitors may prove useful for treating ALI associated with systemic inflammation [245, 246].",

Perforin facilitates granzymes entry into the target cell and that subsequently induces cell death [248]. Granzyme A has originally been thought to induce caspase-independent cell death; however, recent findings suggest that granzyme A may be involved in immune regulation of age-related lung disorders [249, 250]. In contrast, granzyme B induces apoptosis through caspase-dependent and -independent pathways [251]. An increase in granzyme A and B activities is known to promote generation of proinflammatory cytokines. ECM degradation and formation of autoantigens may exacerbate the inflammatory response [251]. Chronic inflammation is a hallmark of age-related cardiovascular and lung diseases. Thus, granzyme A and B may serve as important agent in promoting a positive feedback cycle that may be common to many persistent age-related disorders [251, 252]. However, role of other granzymes such as GzmH, GzmK, and GzmM in age-related ARDS are currently unknown.",

A marked elevation in gelatinase activity was found in BAL fluid from BOS patients that could be due to MMP-9 secretion by local neutrophils [278]. In lung transplant model, inhibition of matrix metalloproteases in the donor and recipient, respectively, before lung harvest and after lung transplantation have been shown to improve oxygenation and markedly decreased PMN leukocyte influx into the isograft [279]. Both MMP-8 and MMP-9 deficient mice were observed to be protected from BOS as evidenced by a marked decrease in neutrophil influx and collagen deposition [280, 281].",

The protease IV-mediated degradation of SP-A and SP-D may cause a discernible loss of bacterial aggregation or increase bacterial phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages [304]. NSPs like NE, PR3 and CatG can cleave the surfactant proteins [305]. These proteases may also cleave SP-D within the conserved sub-region of the C-terminal lectin domain with the generation of a ~35-kDa fragment, which decreases bacterial aggregation and mannan binding of SP-D [306]. P. aeruginosa elastase digestion of SP-D has also been shown to produce the 35-kDa fragment that retain the N-terminal collagen tail, albeit devoid of functional C-terminal globular lectin domain, which consequently elicit loss of innate immune functions [300, 303, 304].",

PM10 was found to be responsible for lung diseases such as tuberculosis [320], emphysema [321] and COPD [322]. In A549 lung epithelial cells, PM10 causes a marked decrease in E-cadherin/\u03b2-catenin expression and subsequently induces potentially invasive characteristics and thereby could contribute to cancer development [323].",

To overcome the unwanted proteolysis of antiproteases, encapsulations of protease inhibitors within liposomes have been suggested [326]. Aerosol delivery of liposomes entrapped antiproteases may prove useful since it has several features such as sustained release and relatively high loading capacities.",

AS112108, another dual MMP-9/MMP-12 inhibitor, has been shown to inhibit the early inflammatory responses with a decrease in neutrophil numbers [330]. AS111793, a selective MMP-12 inhibitor, elicited dose-dependent inhibition in the levels of neutrophils and macrophages in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, and also on the concentration of several inflammation markers that express after cigarette smoke exposure [331].
