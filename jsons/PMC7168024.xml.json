The translation of segment 1b of such a polyprotein is interrupted by the \u20101 ribosomal frameshifting by a putative \u201cslippery\u201d sequence and a corresponding putative pseudoknot structure, which is required for stalling the translating ribosome at the slippery site to undergo \u20101 translational frameshifting. Two functional domains, the papain\u2010like cysteine proteinase (PL2pro) and the 3C\u2010like cysteine proteinase (3CLpro), were identified experimentally and are considered responsible for the proteolytic processing of the polyprotein into 16 subunits. A 375 amino acid SARS\u2010CoV unique domain was identified upstream of the PL2pro domain, not found in any other known CoVs. In addition, seven more putative regions encoding RNA processing enzymes were identified, namely, RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP), RNA helicase (HEL), poly (U)\u2010specific endoribonuclease (NendoU), 3\u2032\u20105\u2032 exonuclease (ExoN), S\u2010adenosylmethionine\u2010dependent ribose 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methyltransferase (2\u2032\u2010O\u2010MT), adenosine diphosphate\u2010ribose 1\u2032\u2010phosphatase (ADRP), and a cyclic phosphodiesterase (CPD). The translation of two polyproteins from the ORF 1a and 1b starts the genome expression (Fig. 1). The polyproteins are then proteolytically processed by PL2pro and 3CLpro into 16 units. PL2pro is responsible for the N\u2010proximal cleavage and 3CLpro is responsible for the C\u2010proximal cleavage. The helicase is then released. ATPase activity and DNA duplex\u2010unwinding activity were demonstrated by purified helicase, indicating that the protein has RNA polymerase activity.\n9\n\n",

            "text": "Together with the M protein, the spike (S) protein is believed to be incorporated into the viral envelope before the mature virion is released. Initial analysis of the 1255a.a. peplomer protein of the virus reveals the possible existence of a signal peptide that would most likely be cleaved between residues 13 and 14.\n11\n, \n12\n It forms typical petal\u2010shaped spikes on the surface of the virion and consists of three domains, the external N\u2010terminal domain with its conserved S1 and S2 subdomains, a transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic domain at the C terminus. S1 is the receptor\u2010binding unit in the N terminus. Molecular modeling of the S1 and S2 subunits of the S glycoprotein suggest that the former unit consists mainly of antiparallel \u03b2\u2010sheets with dispersed \u03b1 and \u03b2 regions, in addition to the three domains identified in the S2 unit. Entry of CoVs into target cells is initiated by binding of the viral S protein to receptor molecules. The S1 domain of SARS\u2010CoV is significantly different from that of other human CoVs, implying that these viruses are using different receptors for host cell entry. The cellular receptor of several group I CoVs are aminopeptidase N and zinc metalloprotease, whereas mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (group II) uses carcinoembryonic antigen\u2010related cell adhesion molecules as a cellular receptor. In the case of SARS\u2010CoV, ACE2 was demonstrated to be a functional receptor for the SARS\u2010CoV in\u2010vitro. Syncytia were observed in cell culture expressing ACE2 and the SARS\u2010CoV S1 domain, which could be inhibited using anti\u2010ACE2 antibody. Fine mapping on the N\u2010terminal unit of the S protein indicates that the minimal receptor\u2010binding domain is located between the residues 318\u2013510.\n10\n Antibodies specific for this S1 subunit of the SARS\u2010CoV S protein were shown to neutralize SARS\u2010CoV infection. The C\u2010type lectin CD209L (also called L\u2010SIGN), a human cellular glycoprotein has been reported to serve as an alternative receptor for SARS\u2010CoV. The S protein of SARS\u2010CoV contains 23 putative N\u2010glycosylation sites, among which 12 have been described to be effectively glycosylated.\n11\n, \n12\n The S protein, when expressed alone, acquires EndoH\u2010resistant complex N\u2010glycans in the Golgi within 30 min following expression. Both high\u2010mannose and complex glycan N\u2010glycoforms have been detected on S trimers within ER and Golgi, respectively, suggesting that trimers form in the ER and pass the quality control to move toward the Golgi to acquire complex N\u2010glycans. It has also been shown that the S glycoprotein is present all along the secretory pathway from the ER to the plasma membrane.\n13\n\n",

A report by Zhu et al.\n35\n showed that the wild\u2010type N was distributed mainly in the cytoplasm. The N\u2010terminal of N, which contains the NLS1 (aa38\u201344), was localized to the nucleus.

Furthermore, deletion of the leucine\u2010rich region (220\u2010LALLLLDRLNRL) resulted in the accumulation of N to the cytoplasm and nucleolus, and when fusing this peptide to enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) localization was cytoplasmic, suggesting that N may act as a shuttle protein.\n35\n A report by Surjit et al.

A signal sequence and three transmembrane domains have been predicted when 3a sequence was searched against SMART server.\n43\n It is a novel SARS\u2010CoV protein that has been shown to be transported efficiently to the cell surface of infected and transfected cells. Its cytoplasmic domain contains sorting signals important for this process. The 3a protein expressed on the cell surface can also undergo endocytosis. It has been shown to interact with M, E, and S proteins suggesting that it may play a role in viral assembly and/or release of virus from infected cells.\n44\n Also it has been shown to form ion channels in Xenopus oocytes. Formation of a pore in the infected cells may aid in virus release. The modulation of virus release may also be one of the important functions of 3a as reduction in 3a protein expression in SARS\u2010infected FRhK4 cells led to a decrease in virus release.\n48\n\n",
