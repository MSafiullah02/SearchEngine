People's adherence to control measures is affected by their knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) towards COVID-19. In this study, we investigated Chinese residents' KAP towards COVID-19 during the rapid rise period of the outbreak. An online sample of Chinese residents was successfully recruited via the authors' networks with residents and popular media in Hubei, China. A self-developed online KAP questionnaire was completed by the participants. The knowledge questionnaire consisted of 12 questions regarding the clinical characteristics and prevention of COVID-19. Assessments on residents' attitudes and practices towards COVID-19 included questions on confidence in winning the battle against COVID-19 and wearing masks when going out in recent days. Among the survey completers (n=6910), 65.7% were women, 63.5% held a bachelor degree or above, and 56.2% engaged in mental labor. The overall correct rate of the knowledge questionnaire was 90%. The majority of the respondents (97.1%) had confidence that China can win the battle against COVID-19. Nearly all of the participants (98.0%) wore masks when going out in recent days. In multiple logistic regression analyses, the COVID-19 knowledge score (OR: 0.75-0.90, P<0.001) was significantly associated with a lower likelihood of negative attitudes and preventive practices towards COVID-2019. Most Chinese residents of a relatively high socioeconomic status, in particular women, are knowledgeable about COVID-19, hold optimistic attitudes, and have appropriate practices towards COVID-19. Health education programs aimed at improving COVID-19 knowledge are helpful for Chinese residents to hold optimistic attitudes and maintain appropriate practices.

Because of the serious situation of the epidemic and the overwhelming news reports on this public health emergency, this population would actively learn knowledge of this infectious disease from various channels of information such as CCTV, the official website of the National Health Commission of China and the Wechat official account of the Wuhan Health Commission.

These figures are similar to our findings on the rates of final success and confidence of winning in the battle against COVID-19. The optimistic attitude of the Chinese residents could be related to the unprecedented COVID-19 control measures such as traffic limits all throughout China and the shutdown of cities and counties of Hubei Province, which enhance people's confidence in winning the battle against the virus. Second, the concerted efforts from across the country also increase Chinese people's confidence to overcome the epidemic, for example, to aid the COVID-19 virus control efforts, many provinces had dispatched thousands of medical workers and provided a large number of medical materials to Wuhan after the outbreak. Third, the good knowledge about COVID-19 among the Chinese residents can also explain this phenomenon, because as shown by results of multiple analyses, higher COVID scores were significantly associated with less likelihood of \"disagree\" and \"I don't know\" answers to question A1 and \"no\" answer to question A2.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 198, "end": 202, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 203, "end": 207, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 208, "end": 212, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Although attitudes towards COVID-19 were optimistic, most residents took precautions to prevent infection by COVID-19: not going to crowded places and wearing masks when going outside.

Second, they also could be the result of the residents' good knowledge regarding the high infectivity of the COVID-19 virus, which can be easily transmitted between people via invisible respiratory droplets. Unfortunately, the present study still showed that 3.6% residents went to crowded places and 2.0% did not wear masks when leaving homes recently. These potentially risky behaviors were related to male gender, occupation of \"students\", marital status of \"others\", residing in other parts of China, and poor COVID-19 knowledge. As suggested by findings from previous studies regarding age and gender patterns of risk-taking behaviors [16] [17] [18] , men and late adolescents are more likely to engage in risk-taking behaviors. In line with these previous findings, we found significant association between male gender and potentially dangerous practices towards COVID-19 in this study. The significantly higher risk of going to a crowded place among students could be ascribed to their young age. The significantly higher risk of not wearing a mask when leaving homes in non-Hubei vs. Hubei residents may be attributed to the less serious situation of the COVID-19 epidemic in non-Hubei parts of China, resulting non-Hubei residents believing that they have a lower risk of infection with the COVID-19 virus.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1008, "end": 1012, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1013, "end": 1017, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1018, "end": 1022, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "It is worth mentioning that higher COVID-19 knowledge scores were found to be significantly associated with a lower likelihood of negative attitudes and potentially dangerous practices towards COVID-19 epidemic in this study.
