            "text": "Eosinophils are able to induce unique inflammatory diseases in cats, including eosinophilic plaque, eosinophilic granuloma, feline indolent ulcer and hypereosinophilic syndrome. Feline gastrointestinal eosinophilic sclerosing fibroplasia (FGESF) is a newly recognised eosinophilic inflammatory disease in cats and is characterised by a firm palpable abdominal mass of the gastrointestinal tract and associated lymph nodes (Craig et al. 2009 , Linton et al. 2015 . Histological features of the mass lesions include dense collagen trabeculae, large fibroblasts and numerous eosinophils (Craig et al. 2009 ). Intralesional bacteria were detected in more than 50% of cats with FGESF (Craig et al. 2009 , Weissman et al. 2013 , Linton et al. 2015 and FGESF-like lesions (Ozaki et al. 2003) . Intralesional fungi were also reported in a cat with FGESF (Grau-Roma et al. 2014) . However, the role of bacterial or fungal infection in the development of FGESF remains to be determined. It has been thought that immunological dysregulation by an unknown cause may be implicated in the pathogenesis of FGESF (Linton et al. 2015) . Prednisolone was shown to prolong the survival time of cats with FGESF (Craig et al. 2009 ). Based on these features of FGESF, the suggested treatment is multimodal -consisting of prednisolone, immunomodulatory agents and antibiotics after surgical resection of the mass (Linton et al. 2015) . However, the efficacy of the therapy has not been reported in cats with FGESF.",

The cat had a history of lung abscess that was not completely resected by surgery approximately 2 years before the current presentation. Physical examination revealed mildly pale mucous membranes and abdominal distension. A complete blood count (CBC) exhibited an increase in the number of white blood cells (WBCs) of 33\u00b71 \u00d7 10 9 cells/L (reference interval, 5\u00b75 to 19\u00b75 \u00d7 10 9 cells/L), neutrophils of 27\u00b71 \u00d7 10 9 cells/L (2\u00b75 to 12\u00b75 \u00d7 10 9 cells/L) and eosinophils of 3\u00b73 \u00d7 10 9 cells/L (0 to 1\u00b75 \u00d7 10 9 cells/L) and moderate anaemia with red blood cells of 4\u00b77 \u00d7 10 12 /L (5\u00b70 to 10\u00b70 \u00d7 10 12 /L), haemoglobin of 70 g/L (80 to 150 g/L) and packed cell volume (PCV) of 19\u00b74% (24\u00b70 to 45\u00b70%). Serum biochemical analysis detected an increase in the level of total protein (TP) of 92 g/L (57 to 78 g/L). Thoracic radiography revealed pulmonary mineralisation associated with the previous lung abscess in the right middle and caudal lobes. Abdominal radiography demonstrated reduced contrast. An abdominal ultrasound illustrated mild ascites and hyperechoic mesentery, suggesting mesenteric peritonitis. CT also demonstrated mild ascites. Radiography, ultrasonography and CT did not detect any abdominal masses. Inspection of ascitic fluid revealed a specific gravity of 1\u00b7038 and TP of 56 g/L, indicating an exudate. The cytology of the ascites demonstrated inflammatory cells, including neutrophils, lymphocytes and eosinophils. Bacteria and fungi were not detected in the ascitic fluid using light microscopy. The antibody titre for feline coronavirus in the sera (IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.) and the real-time PCR analysis for the feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) virus in the ascites (IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.) were negative, ruling out FIP infection.",

Therefore, the cat was subcutaneously (sc) injected with 5 mg/kg enrofloxacin (Baytril\u00ae; Bayer) once daily on days 8, 9 and 10 and intravenously (iv) injected with 30 mg/kg ampicillin sodium (Ampicillin Na KS; Kyoritsu Seiyaku) twice daily on day 9. After the cat was discharged on day 11, it was sc injected with 8 mg/kg cefovecin sodium (Convenia\u00ae; Zoetis Japan) on days 11, 23 and 47. Based on the histological diagnosis, oral administration of 1 mg/kg prednisolone (Prednisolone; Pfizer) every 24 hours and 7 mg/kg ciclosporin A (Atopica\u2122; Kyoritsu Seiyaku) every 24 hours was initiated on day 23. After initiation of treatment with prednisolone and ciclosporin A, lethargy, anorexia and vomiting improved, and ascites diminished. Prednisolone was discontinued on day 44 due to the difficulty of oral administration. Ciclosporin A was administered without concurrent medicine until day 280, and it was then discontinued at the owner's request. The cat was in good condition during treatment with ciclosporin A and remained in good condition after discontinuation. A CBC examined on day 469 revealed that the numbers of WBCs (15\u00b79 \u00d7 10 9 cells/L) and eosinophils (0\u00b77 \u00d7 10 9 cells/L) had returned to within the reference intervals, although the number of neutrophils (14\u00b73 \u00d7 10 9 cells/L) was slightly above the upper reference boundary. The moderate anaemia found on day 1 was improved, with RBCs of 10\u00b70 \u00d7 10 12 /L, haemoglobin of 115 g/L and PCV of 32\u00b75%. The serum level of TP remained elevated (105 g/L). The cat remained in good condition at the time of submission of this report (day 689).",

The cat in this case report did not have an abdominal mass but had firm multifocal small nodules in the mesentery. Histological findings were consistent with FGESF. The cat also displayed weight loss, chronic vomiting and peripheral eosinophilia, which are typical historical and haematological abnormalities observed in cats with FGESF (Craig et al. 2009 , Linton et al. 2015 .

Ciclosporin A suppresses eosinophil-mediated inflammatory responses such as degranulation, cytokine secretion and recruitment to sites of inflammation (Kovalik et al. 2012) . However, the efficacy of ciclosporin A on FGESF has never been reported. The cat in this report received ciclosporin A and prednisolone for 22 days and then received ciclosporin A without any other medications for 236 days. Clinical signs were improved after initiation of prednisolone and ciclosporin A, and good condition was maintained during and after treatment with ciclosporin A. Furthermore, the number of eosinophils in the peripheral blood returned to within the reference interval after treatment with ciclosporin A. These results suggest that the concurrent use of prednisolone and ciclosporin A induced remission, and subsequent administration of ciclosporin A without any medication was effective for the long-term remission of clinical signs associated with FGESF-like lesions in the cat. However, marked hyperproteinaemia was still demonstrated after the end of treatment (day 469), suggesting that an underlying predisposition to this disease persisted.",
