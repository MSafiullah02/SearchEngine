The diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is difficult early in the illness, because its presentation resembles that of other nonspecific viral fevers, such as dengue. Dengue fever is endemic in many of the countries in which the large SARS outbreaks occurred in early 2003. Misdiagnosis may have serious public health consequences. We aimed to determine simple laboratory features to differentiate SARS from dengue.",

Respiratory symptoms may also occur [14] . In the early stages of illness, clinical diagnosis of dengue includes the typical laboratory features, such as thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia-features that have also been reported in patients with SARS, even during the early phases [3, 15] .

            "text": "The initial SARS epidemic was effectively contained worldwide, but sporadic cases continue to occur, and there is potential for new epidemics. The current focus is on ruling out SARS in patients presenting with undifferentiated fever-in particular, in travelers from countries previously affected with SARS. For patients without evidence of pneumonia at the initial evalua- tion, serial observations over time may be needed to identify those for whom isolation precautions can be discontinued safely [23] . Resolution of symptoms and lack of development of radiographic evidence of pneumonia by week 2 of illness argue against the diagnosis of SARS [17] . However, isolating all patients with fever of unknown origin over an extended period of time will overburden any health care system. This study has shown that, with a constellation of basic hematologic and biochemical laboratory parameters, it is possible to differentiate SARS from dengue fever, one of the common differential diagnostic dilemmas in early SARS in Asia. We identified 3 laboratory parameters independently predictive of distinction between dengue and early SARS: a low platelet count, low WBC count, and elevated AST level. For the analysis, we elected to use a cutoff of ! platelets/ 9 140 \u03eb 10 L for platelet count, because this was the cutoff used in a study of hematologic manifestations in patients with SARS [22] , and this cutoff was also shown to be predictive in distinguishing dengue from other infectious diseases in Asia [12] . A WBC count of ! cells/L has been reported to have a high 9 5 \u03eb 10 positive predictive value for dengue fever in patients presenting with febrile illnesses [12, 24] . The cutoff of 34 IU/L for elevated AST level was based on the upper limit of the normal range in our laboratory. A model with the combination of these 3 parameters and using these cutoff values identifies dengue correctly in 75% (sensitivity of 75%) and rules out dengue in 100% (specificity of 100%) of cases. From a public health point of view, a specificity of 100% is desirable so that no case of SARS will be misdiagnosed as dengue, and thus, the patient not be isolated, leading to secondary transmission. With a sensitivity of 75%, still \u223c25% of patients with dengue will need to be isolated, until the results of dengue-specific tests become available.",

Lymphopenia is characteristic and of similar magnitude for both dengue and SARS. However, lymphopenia in dengue was also associated with depletion of total WBC count and neutrophil count, whereas for SARS, it was associated with normal total WBC count and normal-to-high neutrophil count. Neutrophilia in patients with SARS has been described in several case series but may be due to steroid treatment or secondary bacterial infection [15, 22] . This was not seen in our patients, most likely because the values were taken before the institution of any therapy. Elevated lactate dehydrogenase level is a predictor for poor prognosis in SARS [15] , but the majority of patients with SARS admitted early in the course of disease had normal values. Although we did not have data for the cohort of patients with dengue, lactate dehydrogenase levels have been reported to be moderately elevated in patients with dengue [25] ; therefore, this parameter is unlikely to discriminate between dengue and SARS.",

We did not include epidemiological factors, but such data will provide important additional information in differentiating dengue from early SARS-in particular, a history of close contact with a patient with laboratoryconfirmed SARS or hospital staff during a nosocomial SARS outbreak. We did not consider other viral infections in which the patient may present with lymphopenia [26] .
