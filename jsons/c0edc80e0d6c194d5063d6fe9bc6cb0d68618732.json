The public anxiety has increased the psychological burden on government and healthcare professionals, resulting in a government worker suicide in Japan. The terrified people are asking the government for border measures. However, are border measures possible for this virus? By analysing 48 almost complete virus genome sequences, we found out that the viruses that invaded Taiwan, the United States, and Japan were introduced independently. We identified thirteen parsimony-informative sites and three groups (CTC, TCC, and TCT). Viruses found outside China did not form a monophyletic clade, opposite to previous study. These results suggest the difficulty of implementing effective border measures against this virus.",

It is reasonable to think that restricting human movement is effective in managing viruses, as human movement accelerates the spread of the virus. A total ban on traffic could have helped control virus transmission [2] . Movement of people across the sea by plane or ship is considered necessary in the movement of viruses [3] . Several governments announced strengthened border measures to prevent viral border invasion [4, 5] . The various restrictions associated with the pandemic hurt not only the economy [6] , but also the mental health [7, 8] . The fear of the virus has resulted in discrimination and excessive demands on the government. A 37-yearold government worker who worked on antivirus committed suicide in Japan [7] . With the availability of viral genome sequences, research is being conducted into many different aspects [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . An analysis of previously collected viral genomes indicated that viruses outside China formed a monophyletic clade, suggesting the effectiveness of border measures [14] . Recently, more complete viral genome sequences have been published, providing more resources to discuss virus transmission [15] . Although several phylogenetic trees of the virus have been published, many analyzes including fragment sequences did not provide accurate phylogenetic information. Therefore, we scrutinized the available viral sequences and collected only fulllength viral genomic sequences for phylogenetic analysis.",

            "text": "Phylogenies of SARS-CoV-2 were constructed based on the ORF sequences ( Figure 2 and Figure  S2 ). DNA-based phylogeny under the separating each codon position condition (Figure 2) showed the highest final log-likelihood and 2nd-lowest AIC score among DNA-based phylogenetic trees. On the other hand, protein-based phylogenetic tree ( Figure  S2F ) might not be reliable because the tree was constructed based on less informative sites except for the synonymous substitution sites. According to our phylogeny, the group CTC formed a monophyletic clade, including all samples isolated from Chinese in Wuhan except for \"CNA0007335-Human-China-HubeiProvince-WuhanCity\". Samples of the group TCC and TCT were paraphyletic for group CTC and located near the root of the tree. Our phylogenies suggest that the \"Bat-SARS-like coronavirus\" (MG772933) and \"BatCoV RaTG13\" are more closely related to samples included in the group TCC and TCT than samples included in the group CTC. Some of the phylogenies constructed under other conditions suggest the different phylogenetic position of group TCC and TCT, however, support the monophyly and the same phylogenetic position of group CTC ( Figure S2 ). These results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 widely spread in Wuhan is different from that of other areas. In areas other than Wuhan, where virus invasion has been observed, the damage has not seemed to be as severe as Wuhan, however the spread of group CTC might increase the damage in the near future. From the perspective of virus control, sequencing should be performed since viruses have multiple properties that is hard to be distinguished by qPCR. The viral genome sequences \"MT039890-Human-Sourth-Korea\" and \"GWHABKG0000000-Human-China-Hubei-Province-Wuhan-City\" have many sample-specific substitutions in their sequence. The viral genome sequence \"MN988713-Human-USA-Illinois-Chicago\" has several ambiguous bases in parsimony-informative sites, discovered in this study. Interestingly, the ambiguous bases can be explained by the mixture of group TCC and CTC (Table 4 ). This fact suggests that \"MN988713-Human-USA-Illinois-Chicago\" contains at least two different viral genomes. We could corroborate this hypothesis after next generation sequence data release.",
