Chloroquine has been shown to inhibit the hERG K+ channels in a concentration- and time-dependent manner [5]. Inhibition of the hERG channel can lead to prolongation of the action potential duration and, consequently, of the QT interval of the electrocardiogram (ECG), which may lead to torsade de pointes, a polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmia [6].

In a study in healthy Thai volunteers (n = 16) a 600-mg dose resulted in a mean QTc interval (Fridericia corrected) prolongation of maximally 6.1 ms [3]. One explanation for the more pronounced QTc prolongation in our study is probably that we measured the interval after multiple doses of chloroquine instead of after a single dose. Since chloroquine has a very large distribution volume (200\u2013800 l/kg), and a long half-life of 20\u201360 days [10], chloroquine plasma concentrations increase continually during the 5\u2011day treatment period, since the steady-state concentration has not yet been achieved. Due to concentration-dependent blockade of the hERG channel [5], the effect on the QTc interval is also expected to keep increasing with rising plasma concentrations. Another explanation could be that these patients are severely ill and hence may have ventricular remodelling, which may make them more susceptible.",

            "text": "This is a study with a large sample size compared to other studies on this topic and is, to our knowledge, the first to study the QTc-prolonging potential of chloroquine in the context of COVID-19 treatment. A limitation of this study is its retrospective nature with the consequence that ECGs were not captured at exactly the expected time of maximum plasma concentrations. On the other hand, our findings can also be regarded as a good reflection of how ECG monitoring with computerised interpretation takes place in regular practice. In this connection, we would like to mention that the objective of this study was not to study the difference between computerised and manual interpretation of QTc intervals on ECGs or the validity of either method.",
