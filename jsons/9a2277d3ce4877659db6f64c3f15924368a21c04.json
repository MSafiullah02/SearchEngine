            "text": "The spreading of certain behaviors (contagion) in the human society has social, economical, and political implications, which has attracted a great deal of interdisciplinary research effort. Conventional methods developed to uncover and understand the dynamics of social contagion are more or less based on some kind of threshold and memory effects [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . For example, it is likely for an individual to adopt certain behavior if he/she possesses friends who have already adopted the behavior. From a network point of view, for a node to adopt certain behavior, the number of connected nodes who have already accepted and exhibit the behavior must exceed a threshold [1, 11] . That is, an individual will become willing to adopt a behavior if he/she has received sufficient and repeated information about the behavior from his/her friends (or neighbors in the underlying social network) [12, 13] . In the real world, the influences of network neighbors and the tendency for any individual to adopt certain behavior can be * shimin.cai81@gmail.com highly nonuniform. There is empirical evidence that individuals and their social contacts tend to play heterogeneous roles in contagion [14, 15] . For example, regardless of the nature of the behavior, there always exist certain individuals who are reluctant to accept or adopt the behavior. To account for the heterogeneity, a variant of the classic threshold model [1] was introduced [11] , where a certain fraction of nodes were assumed to be immune to the behavior. These are the blocked nodes, and if their number or density is large enough, both the extent and diffusion speed of the contagion spreading will be suppressed, provided that no cascading or avalanche type of processes occur. The effects of heterogeneity in social contacts have been recently studied [16] using a contagion threshold model incorporating weighted edges, with the finding that heterogeneity in the weights can suppress the propagation of contagion.",

In recent years, spreading dynamics driven by reinforcement have attracted a great deal of attention from researchers in diverse fields including social science, economics, and physics [9, 12, [17] [18] [19] [20] . The key fact that motivated our present work is that, with respect to reinforcement, the nature of social contacts can have drastically different impacts. In particular, from close social contacts such as family members, friends, and colleagues, reinforcement can be much stronger than that from conventional or ordinary social contacts with, e.g., strangers. For a model of social contagion to capture the real behaviors as accurately as possible, the distinct reinforcement effects from close and ordinary social contacts must be taken into account.",

            "text": "The need to distinguish two types of social contacts in terms of their influences has been well documented in the literature. Historically, Lazarsfeld and Merton pointed out that mass media messages can be reinforced by interpersonal communications [21] . There were empirical evidence and theories for the conjecture that more interpersonal conversation or discussions can promote the impact of media information through reinforcement [22, 23] . In general, individuals are more likely to engage in interpersonal communications with family, friends or colleagues as often as they get media news or messages from newspapers or other individuals [24] . That is, for reinforcement, close social contacts are more effective than interaction with machines or strangers. At the present, there exists considerable empirical evidence that, even for interpersonal communications, there is heterogeneity in their role in social reinforcement. In general, the degree of reinforcement depends on factors such as individual responsiveness, the number of neighbors capable of reinforcing, and respondent-reinforcer pairing [25] [26] [27] . For example, the number of reinforcers is determined by the degree of the individual in the social network, and reinforcement among strangers, even if there are social contacts among them, is far less likely than that among close relationships [27] . That is, in reality, social contagion is strongly contact-based, and not all social contacts can lead to reinforcement.",

In general, both types of contacts exist, and the question is how their coexistence affects the basic dynamical behaviors. In this paper, we propose a general model of social contagion with two distinct transmission channels: one through close and another through ordinary contacts. For random networks, we develop an analytical edge-based compartmental method to solve the model, which enables us to make a number of predictions in terms of the fundamental characterizing quantities such as the final outbreak size, the outbreak threshold, and the nature of the phase transition. We also carry out extensive agent-based, stochastic simulations to assess the performance of the model. For random networks, the computations reveal that continuous (second order) and discontinuous (first order) phase transitions coexist in random networks, which is ascertained by an analytic bifurcation analysis of the system. A computational study of two representative empirical networks with a heterogeneous degree distribution from the real world reveals that only continuous transitions can be expected. We provide a physical understanding of the basic spreading dynamics through a detailed statistical analysis, uncover the conditions under which contagion prevalence can arise, and validate the existence of an optimal fraction of ordinary contacts for outbreak at a global scale.",

In particular, only when there are propagation paths of sufficient length which involve both close and ordinary contacts are largescale outbreaks of social contagions possible. The second phenomenon is that, for heterogeneous networks, a considerable number of close contacts will promote outbreak of the contagion by forming channels for successful transmissions among hubs. Taken together, ordinary contacts make possible spreading over the entire network, while close contacts not only shape the way by which outbreaks occur, i.e., through a second or first order phase transition in random networks, but also facilitate local spreading and outbreaks in heterogeneous networks. These results provide quantitative insights into how social behaviors can emerge and become prevalent, which has potential implications not only to social science, but also to economics and political science.",

The total number of edges is E = N k /2, where each edge represents a particular social contact between two individuals. The dynamics of social contagion are governed by the standard susceptible-adopted-recovered (SAR) model, where any node (individual) can be in one of the three states. In particular, a node in the susceptible state may adopt a behavior when it receives information about it from its neighbors who have already adopted the behavior. If a node is in the adopted state, then with certain probability it will transmit the information to its susceptible neighbors. A node in the recovered state is \"idle\" and does not transmit any information. A unique feature, which makes our model distinct from the classic SAR model, is that there are two distinct ways for an adopted node to transit information to a susceptible neighbor, depending on whether the underlying social contact is close or ordinary. Empirical evidence [25] [26] [27] suggests that the transmission associated with a close contact contributes to reinforcement, but that with an ordinary contact does not. For a close contact, there is a memory effect in that the number m of times that a susceptible node receives the information from the adopted neighbors is stored and used to determine the probability that the node actually adopts the behavior [13] , making the underlying dynamics non-Markovian. However, for an ordinary contact, a susceptible individual would accept the behavior from any adopted neighbor with probability p. We subsequently extend our model to empirical networks.",

The spreading process starts and proceeds according to the SAR model, and the nodal dynamical states evolve using the synchronous updating rule. Specifically, an individual (i) who has adopted the behavior attempts to transmit the behavioral information to its susceptible neighbors (j ). For a close social contact, the transmission from the adopted end to the susceptible end occurs with probability q, and j will successfully adopt the message or behavior only if it has received the information at least T times, where T is the adoption threshold. In this case, there is reinforcement. For an ordinary contact, j becomes adopted with probability p, or the transmission rate, without contributing to the accumulated times m.

            "text": "A fundamental feature of the spreading dynamics of social contagion is the emergence of phase transitions: as a system parameter varies through a critical point, an outbreak occurs. The transition can be continuous (second order) or discontinuous (first order). To gain insights into the role of close versus ordinary contacts in the characteristics of phase transition, we calculate the final fraction of the recovered population for different values of T and \u03bc numerically and theoretically, as shown in Fig. 1 . In all cases, there is a phase transition. As the fraction of close contacts in the network is increased, there is a change in the nature of the phase transition from being continuous to discontinuous, where the abrupt change in the final recovered population at the transition point can be quite large for relatively large values of the fraction. The dynamical origin of the discontinuity can be attributed to the relative abundance of the close contacts that lay the ground for the occurrence of a drastic avalanche type of process, as suggested by the previous result that a sufficient number of close contacts with a relatively large transmission rate can trigger a massive outbreak of contagion [13, 34] . For relatively higher values of the adoption threshold T , second order transitions are more likely, as illustrated in Fig. 1(c) . The reason lies in the susceptible individuals in the critical state, i.e., the individuals who have been informed by their adopted neighbors through close contacts but have not adopted the message or information yet. For a large value of T , it is more difficult to make these individuals adopt the behavior, thereby requiring more transmission to trigger a massive adoption process. The contribution of reinforcement in this case is insignificant, leading to a smaller avalanche size [34, 35] . Note the good agreement between numerical and theoretical results, which validates the edge-based compartmental approach. Figure 1 also shows that close contacts of sufficient number tend to delay the outbreak of massive contagion, as the corresponding threshold values are larger than T C = k /( k 2 \u2212 k ) = k \u22121 as predicted by the bond-percolation theory for the conventional susceptible-infected-refractory (SIR) dynamics [36, 37] . More close contacts are more effective at preventing a large-scale outbreak, regardless of the values of the transmission rate and adoption threshold T . This is quite surprising as previous work had concluded that dense contacts with social reinforcement would in general facilitate contagion [17] . The counterintuitive phenomenon can be understood by estimating the contributions of the two types of distinct contacts to the spreading dynamics. Figure 2 shows the key statistical characterizing quantities for p = 0.3: the fraction of recovered population (the first column), the numbers of three types of transmission events (the second column), the distribution P (L) of diffusion path lengths L (the third column), and the frequency spectrum of the occurrence of ordinary transmission events in the various diffusion paths (the fourth column). More specifically, in our model, transmission events can be classified into three major categories: (a) transmission associated with ordinary contacts which occurs with proba- Figure 2 illustrates a key feature of the system: When the number of ordinary transmission events approximately matches n D (t ) during the spreading process, i.e., n O (t ) \u2248 n D (t ), the system evolves into the state of maximum contagion. For a relatively small value of \u03bc [ Fig. 2(a) ], close contacts are insufficient so that the amount of susceptible individuals in critical state are less than ordinary transmissions ought to stimulate. For a larger value of \u03bc, ordinary transmission events are rare and the two types of reinforced transmission events decrease in number even for a fixed value of the transmission rate p. The third column of Fig. 2 indicates the existence of an appreciable number of diffusion paths of intermediate and long length (e.g., L 7) for the case where contagion is prevalent [Figs. 2(a) and 2(b)], and that short paths dominate when contagion is prohibited [ Fig. 2(c) ]. The behavior of the recovered population size suggests that long diffusion paths favor contagion when the value of the transmission rate and the fraction of ordinary contacts are proper to enable the dynamics.",

For the cases shown, short paths (L 5) are mostly due to ordinary transmission events, while , the nonempty squares below the diagonal lines have a relatively wide distribution, indicating that ordinary transmission tends to \"cooperate\" with successful reinforced transmission to propagate the contagion forward together, enabling persistent transmission and generating long diffusion paths. Specifically, the more frequently ordinary transmission events are engaged in contagion propagation along longer paths (more nonempty squares below the diagonal lines in regions of large values of L), the population has more adopted individuals. That is, the existence of the long diffusion paths containing a substantial number of ordinary transmission events imply a long-time cooperative relationship between the two different types of transmission events. The extent of contagion is maximized when the number of susceptible individuals in the critical state induced by close contacts matches the number of ordinary transmission events as induced by ordinary contacts. There then exists an optimal fraction of close contacts to facilitate contagion to the maximum extent.",

            "text": "The existence of an optimal fraction of close transmission events can be further illustrated numerically and analytically, as shown in Fig. 3 , where the existence of the optimal fraction is more apparent for small values of p and T . This means that the system can be harnessed to reach a maximum level of contagion without the need to change the transmission rate p. For a relatively large value of p and a not too large value of \u03bc, ordinary contacts can be exploited to maximize the spreading in that it is more likely that the interplay between ordinary and successful reinforced transmission events will generate long diffusion paths. Note that the transitions with respect to varying \u03bc are mostly discontinuous, especially in cases where there exists an interval of \u03bc values with maximum spreading. Figure 4 provides a visual picture of the results in Fig. 3 , which further validates the physical picture for achieving maximum contagion in Fig. 2 through a match between the numbers of close and ordinary transmission events: n m (t ) n e (t ) for \u03bc 2 = \u03bc o = 0.31. Prevalence of the recovered population is not possible when close contacts dominate so there is a lack of cooperation with ordinary contacts, regardless of the occurrence of intermediate reinforced transmission [e.g., the second plot in Fig. 2(c) ]. Overall, frequent cooperation between ordinary and successful reinforced transmission events along long diffusion paths is key to and plays a more important role in contagion prevalence rather than the mere existence of the long diffusion paths. Ordinary contacts are thus indispensable for successful social contagion. Further support for requiring a nontrivial interplay between close and ordinary contacts in promoting large-scale spreading is provided in Fig. 5 , where the colored square in the red circle reveals the cooperation between close and ordinary contacts along a long diffusion path of length L = 16 that consists of 15 ordinary and one successfully reinforced The phase transition scenarios of the system can be graphically understood through a bifurcation analysis of Eq. (15), as shown in Fig. 6 . There are three distinct scenarios: continuous transition [ Fig. 6(a) ], transition at the triple point [ Fig. 6(b) ], and discontinuous transitions [ Fig. 6(c) ]. For the continuous transition, the graphical solution (the crossing point between the two relevant curves) moves gradually away from the position of \u03b8 s = 1 and \u03b8 n = 1 to that of \u03b8 s < 1 and \u03b8 n < 1. The crossing point begins to leave the top right corner of the plot at the critical point p = p C . Associated with the triple point transition, although there exists one crossing point, two curves are close to each other near the crossing point that tends to move abruptly, which is indicative of a discontinuous transition. Note that the triple point can be estimated with the aid of pattern features of the solution lines, as illustrated in Fig. 6(b) . For the discontinuous transitions, a solution for which the crossing points decrease from three (corresponding to contagion decay) to two (corresponding to contagion outbreak) until only one (contagion prevailing). Furthermore, Eq. (16) gives the tangent point of the two curves presented in the second subplot of Fig. 6(c) . The crossing point (yellow solid circles) closest to the top right corner of the plot (i.e., \u03b8 s = 1 and \u03b8 n = 1) is physically meaningful, because the dynamics start from the initial conditions \u03b8 s \u2248 1 and \u03b8 n \u2248 1. The movement of the yellow points is caused by the shift of blue lines, indicating again the role played by the transmission events due to ordinary contacts in the phase transition. Figures 7 and 8 provide a comprehensive picture in the parameter plane of (\u03bc, p) of the spreading dynamics, where the former is numerically obtained while the latter is theoretical predictions. Note that the numerically identified critical boundaries and the analytically estimated triple point are included. Both figures represent evidence for the coexistence of continuous and discontinuous phase transitions separated by the triple point. More specifically, smooth color variations and dramatic differences in the color indicate continuous and discontinuous types of transition, respectively. There is an overall good agreement between the simulation results and the analytic predictions, although there is deviation between the two types of results in the region of large values of \u03bc. The discrepancies are somewhat expected, due to the numerical uncertainties in identifying the outbreak phase of the contagion through a finite number of statistically independent realizations. In general, the analytical predictions are more reliable, as evidenced by the better agreement with the numerical results for the limited parameter setting in which more extensive stochastic simulations are computationally feasible (e.g., the results in Figs. 1 and 3) . The results in Figs. 7 and 8 indicate that the threshold and transition classes are predominately determined by the relative abundance of close contacts with respect to ordinary contacts in the underlying social network. Another feature is that the spreading dynamics in the presence of reinforcement (T > 1) is completely suppressed when the value of \u03bc exceeds certain threshold whose value decreases with T , due to the lack of match between the two types of social contacts. Note that, in Figs. 7 and 8, the boundaries of continuous transitions are longer for higher values of T , a result that is consistent with those in Fig. 1 . Figure 9 shows, for ER random networks, the final stationary distributions of the recovered population for three values of the average degree k (or equivalently p e ). We observe that a relatively high average degree tends to facilitate the expansion of the contagion. Especially, a large average degree means that the adopted individuals will have more chances to transmit the contagion to their connected susceptible neighbors, resulting in a larger contagion size and a smaller outbreak threshold. At the same time, for a fixed value of \u03bc, the individuals will have more close contacts, so that more susceptible individuals can reach the critical state, leading to relatively more massive adoption within a short time and an avalanchelike outbreak through subsequent transmission. Thus, as the value of the average degree is increased, more discontinuous transitions occur at the critical boundaries.",

For p < p h , abundant close contacts in the network can promote the contagion and lead to an outbreak, in contrast to ER random networks where this happens only for T = 1. Because of the random allocation strategy of closed contacts among all connections, hubs have a natural advantage to possess a considerable number of close contacts.

In fact, the correlation serves to FIG. 13 . Statistical behaviors of close contacts in the PGP network. Three key statistical characterizing quantities of close contacts are shown: (a) the expected number of close contacts that each node in different degree class can own for two different values of \u03bc, (b) the distribution of the edges between two nodes (node 1 and node 2, where k 1 and k 2 are the degrees of the two end nodes of an edge), normalized by the total number E of edges in the network, and (c) the distribution of the close contacts between two nodes for \u03bc = 0.1, normalized by E. (d) The distribution of the close contacts between two nodes for \u03bc = 0.8. Because of the symmetry in the distribution, only half of the matrix is given in (b, c), where each color point indicates the value of d (k 1 , k 2 ) or d (k 2 , k 1 ), and d (k 1 , k 2 ) is the fraction of edges with two nodes of degree k 1 and k 2 , respectively. The pink squares in (a) indicate that those nodes of high degree have considerable numbers of close contacts-a great advantage for transmission. The contagion spreads readily among these hubs due to the sufficient close contacts among them. The adopted areas are localized for small values of p. Similar phenomena are also found for the first-order null network model of PGP. The reason for the former is that a larger threshold value for successful adoption makes it harder for not only ordinary but also hub nodes to adopt the contagion through close contacts. Especially, hub nodes no longer have the advantage to take lead in promoting the spreading. Outbreak of the contagion is thus delayed or even completely suppressed by abundant close contacts in the network, as for ER networks.

Agent-based simulations and theoretical analyses have revealed the coexistence of both continuous and discontinuous phase transitions in ER random networks.

Our findings are consistent with previous results from threshold models incorporating some kind of social reinforcement mechanism [13, 16, 40] .

To have a global outbreak, a sufficient amount of ordinary transmission is needed. We have obtained a physical understanding of this phenomenon through a detailed statistical analysis of the spreading dynamics in terms of the frequencies of three different types of transmission modes, the distribution of diffusion paths of various lengths, and the frequencies of the occurrence of transmission along the diffusion paths. The analysis has revealed that, to achieve maximum spreading, a matching condition must be met: n O (t ) \u2248 n D (t ), i.e., the number of close contacts available to susceptible individuals in the critical state must approximately match the number of ordinary contacts. There exists an optimal fraction of close contacts to maximize the spreading, which depends on the values of the transmission rate and adoption threshold. The key to making spreading prevalent lies in the interplay between ordinary and successfully reinforced transmission events associated with long diffusion paths, which cannot occur unless there is a sufficient amount of ordinary transmission. If ordinary contacts are scarce, then spreading will become stagnant. Ordinary contacts thus play a crucial role in promoting social contagion when both types of social contacts are simultaneously present. In addition, a sufficient number of close contacts can change the nature of the phase transition from continuous to discontinuous, and leads to an increase in the value of the outbreak threshold.",

Close contacts are capable of promoting spreading but only on a local scale, especially near the hubs, making it difficult to achieve global prevalence of the contagion even though contagion outbreaks can still occur. For a large threshold value, close contacts tend to become an obstacle to transmission: global contagion will be prevented if the network is rich in close contacts, which is similar to what happens in ER networks. The lack of avalanche-like spreading, which results from inadequate number of susceptible individuals in the critical state, imposes a limit to the cooperation between ordinary and successful reinforced transmission induced by two types of contacts along long paths, leading to the absence of an optimal intermediate value \u03bc to maximize the contagion spreading.",

In detail, a new first-order null network with the same degree sequence of PGP is built after every 25 independent realizations of the spreading dynamics. The solid white circles indicate the numerically estimated phase boundaries with respect to the relative variance \u03bd(\u221e). The dashed lines indicate the position of p h , which are absent for T > 6 in the top panels and T = 10 in the bottom panels because closed contacts tend to block the contagion when the value of T becomes large.
