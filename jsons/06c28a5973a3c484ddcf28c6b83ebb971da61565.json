Our tool was integrated into a pre-existing decision-making process regularly conducted by 9 teams of undergraduate students. We find an overall positive response to Decidio based on the results of a tool evaluation survey that we conducted after our experiment. Furthermore, we conduct a Big-Five Factor personality survey of participants and associate personalities with interactions recorded by our tool. We find that the students who demonstrate leadership behaviors through their interactions score higher in extraversion and lower in conscientiousness than other students. Our analysis also reveals that agreeableness is strongly correlated with dissimilarity between group ranking outcomes and initially indicated individual preferences.",

Researchers have reviewed and elucidated what years of research on small groups and teams can tell us about the processes that contribute to team effectiveness. Using that knowledge they have identified leverage points for making teams more effective such as team learning, cohesion, efficacy and group potency [8] . Furthermore, a study examining relationships among work teams with respect to team composition (ability and personality), team process (social cohesion), and team outcomes (team viability and team performance) found that interpersonally oriented personality characteristics, such as conscientiousness, agreeableness, extraversion, and emotional stability can also be important predictors of team effectiveness [1] .",

Group decision support systems (GDSS) eventually evolved to consider not only the role of the ultimate decision-maker, but also the communication between everyone in the decision-making group [3, 5, 14] . Turban et al. [14] have identified the major components that make up these systems. Some of them, such as database analysis and visualization, constitute independent fields of research within computer science. Others, such as support for Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM), more appropriately fall under management science [13] . In recent years, researchers have explored Internet-based algorithms and workflows for decision-making at scale [9, 11] . Furthermore, inferring consensus among members of a group in a data-driven fashion has long been a goal in anthropology and social psychology. [12] demonstrates the use of Cultural Mixture Modeling (CMM) for inferring consensus among members of heterogeneous multidisciplinary professional teams in an example decisionmaking process. The findings of their study inform team decision-making based on shared beliefs and team composition.",

Displaying statistics about individual rankings: Decidio displays basic statistics for the group, generated from the individual ranking phase when the users are working on the group rankings. This feature helps users make decisions which encompass opinions of everyone in the group. 6. Analysis of user behavior through logs: Decidio logs highly granular interactions in the tool.

The first course in the program involves a final project in which teams of students collaborate with a campus organization on process improvement. Each team is able to indicate their preference for which of the available projects they would like to work on. Historically, teams had indicated this preference by submitting a hand-written ranking of projects to the course instructor after a brief period of deliberation. The instructor would then allocate the projects to fulfill these preferences to the best of her ability. Our team identified this decision-making process as an opportunity to test the pilot of Decidio in a real-world scenario. The tool was used by 45 users divided into 9 teams.

We then analyzed the 37 responses to study the relations between personality traits of group members and group decision making. From comparing the personality trait scores of \"active operators\" from the logs, we learned that the active operators tend to have higher median score on extraversion and lower median score on conscientiousness. (Figure 5b) We also explored how personality may have affected the decision outcome for each group. We came up with a metric to represent the dissimilarity between two rankings.

We looked for correlations between normalized dissimilarity and percentile scores for the Big Five Factor personality survey. We calculated a Pearson correlation coefficient between normalized dissimilarity and each of the five personality factors. The results of this analysis are shown in Table 1 .

The bias towards Extraversion among active operators is consistent with these results, however the bias against Conscientiousness in that group is not. Of course, the association we make between active operation of the tool and general leadership is based in assumption and may not hold in all cases (as described in Sect. 5.2).

It's an extrapolation, albeit a reasonable one, to connect the \"Operator\" workflow described in Sect. 4.2 to the subjective notion of team leadership, for example. We recognize that the \"Operator\" may have been acting as a sort of team note-taker or secretary for the session rather than the leader of the discussion. Second, we did not test with a control group. This nuances the results from the user survey, as we're not able to draw a comparison to a team who collaborates on a ranking with a default method (e.g., pen and paper). Finally, it is difficult to generalize results about user behavior in the tool when each team consists of a different mix of personalities and individual ranking preferences. For example, a team with insignificant differences between individual preferences for projects may not have much to disagree about, even if their personalities would suggest a higher likelihood of conflict.",
