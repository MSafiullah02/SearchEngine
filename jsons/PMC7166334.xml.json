ARTI was defined as nasal congestion, sore throat, new or increased cough, wheezing, sputum production, or respiratory difficulty with or without fever. ARTI cases were evaluated by a project nurse with a directed history and physical exam. SaO2 was measured percutaneously; two nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained for viral and chlamydia culture. Expectorated sputum was collected, if available, for bacterial culture. Subjects were followed daily until symptoms resolved. Convalescent sera were obtained 4 weeks after onset of the illness.

This rate is high when compared with previously reported rates of acute respiratory illnesses in persons over 65. The CDC's 1991 statistics showed a rate of 4.3 respiratory conditions per 100 person months and, in a study by Reuben et al of independent elderly, a rate of 3 per 100 person months was noted.\n9\n, \n10\n There are several possible explanations for higher rates of infection in daycare, with the most likely being the increased exposure to infectious agents. This may have been an important factor in our study because elderly daycare participants were visited by preschool children, a group known to have high rates of respiratory infections. It is also possible that elderly individuals who attend daycare are more debilitated and thus more susceptible to infection. The rate of infection found in our study may also be caused, in part, by the intensity of our direct surveillance and the fact that winter months accounted for 9 of 15 months of study. A definitive comparison of the incidence of ARTI in elderly attending daycare with elderly in the community is beyond the scope of this study; yet, these data suggest that seniors in daycare experience a higher rate of ARTI than those who are independent.",

Of documented etiologies, viral infection was the most common. In studies of young children in daycare, viral infections account for the majority of respiratory illnesses as well.\n11\n Respiratory syncytial virus was the most frequently diagnosed infection in the elderly group. RSV has been described as a cause of community\u2010acquired pneumonia in elderly adults as well as a cause of respiratory disease in nursing homes. Recent studies indicate that RSV may be an important, yet frequently undiagnosed, pathogen in this age group.\n12\n, \n13\n, \n14\n, \n15\n, \n16\n, \n17\n Influenza is a widely recognized cause of morbidity and mortality among the elderly, and Influenza A was found to be the second most common isolate in our study. The clinical illness associated with Influenza A was not significantly different from other illnesses; however, the clinical syndrome may have been altered by the fact that 90% of participants received influenza vaccine before the second winter season.",

Infections with mycoplasma and C. pneumoniae were uncommon in both the staff and elderly participants of our study. C. pneumoniae is a relatively newly recognized pathogen, and larger studies employing both cultures and serology will be needed to define the impact of this organism in this age group.\n19\n\n",

It would seem likely that infections were brought to the center from many different sources. Since many elderly attendees went home to family members, this population was not as \u201cclosed\u201d as one sees in nursing homes, where more clear\u2010cut nosocomial outbreaks have occurred. While attention to basic infection control practices is important, decreasing the rates of ARTI in senior daycare will require more complex solutions. Future efforts should be directed toward improving compliance with currently available vaccines, the design and delivery of new vaccines, and understanding aging\u2010related immunologic risk factors.",

The rates of infection appear to be higher for seniors in daycare than for independent elderly. Similar to children's daycare centers, respiratory infections attributable to viruses were most commonly diagnosed; however, these viral infections appear to cause more serious illness in elderly adults than in children and young adults. Although the rates of pneumonia, hospitalization, and death were higher in the elderly when compared with the staff, these conventional methods of judging the effects of respiratory infections may not adequately reflect the true impact in this age group. Since the elderly are a group for whom independence is critically linked to functional status, future studies should examine the functional impact of ARTI in the elderly as well as better methods of treatment and prevention.",
