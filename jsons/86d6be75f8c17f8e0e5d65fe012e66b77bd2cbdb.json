It has only been in the 1990s that consensus defi nitions for sepsis and septic shock were achieved. It was hoped that the development of standard defi nitions would not only enable accurate characterization of the epidemiology of sepsis, but also serve to stratify patients early in the course of sepsis for the purpose of clinical studies aimed at testing novel therapies. The most widely used defi nition of pediatric sepsis/septic shock is based on the 1992 American College of Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care Medicine (ACCP/SCCM) Consensus Conference, with adaptations for the pediatric population. The following four defi nitions resulted from these discussions: SIRS , sepsis , septic shock , and severe sepsis . Although there is overlap between some of these terms (particularly between septic shock and severe sepsis), each is intended to defi ne a particular patient population.",

SIRS defi nes a state of infl ammation/immune activation in a child and is based on the presence of at least two of the four criteria listed in Table 27 -1 . Thus, patients with diverse clinical conditions such as sepsis, pancreatitis, burns, or severe trauma can meet criteria for SIRS. It has been argued that the SIRS defi nition is non-specifi c and that too broad a range of patients are ultimately classifi ed as having SIRS. Nevertheless, the criteria have been widely used in both prescriptive and interventional studies to enhance the \"capture\" of all patients at risk for the subsequent development of severe sepsis or septic shock.

The shock associated with 555 C HAPTER 27 \u2022 S EPS IS sepsis is unique in that all three forms are likely to be present. Hypovolemic shock results from capillary leak, increased insensible losses, and decreased effective blood volume secondary to venodilation. Cardiogenic shock is related to direct myocardial depression, the cause(s) of which remains the focus of investigation. Finally, distributive shock is often apparent as brisk capillary refi ll, widened pulse pressure and bounding peripheral pulses and is caused by abnormally decreased systemic vascular resistance from pathologic vasodilation. The particular pattern of these hemodynamic physiologic perturbations manifested by any individual patient can be variable. Some children have increased cardiac output with diminished systemic vascular resistance characteristic of distributive shock or the so-called \"warm\" shock state. In stark contrast to adults, in which this hemodynamic profi le (increased cardiac output/decreased systemic vascular resistance) is most common, children more frequently present with depressed cardiac output and elevated systemic vascular resistance. These patients appear cool with diminished pulses and poor capillary refi ll that is characteristic of the \"cold\" shock state.

Chest x-ray fi ndings can reveal a small heart in the presence of hypovolemia with few vascular markings. Alternatively, the combination of capillary leak, decreased myocardial function and the result of fl uid resuscitation in some children with sepsis can result in pulmonary edema. Rapid progression to acute respiratory failure from ARDS is not uncommon. All organ systems and ultimately cellular functions are affected by poor perfusion and decreased oxygen delivery related to depressed cardiac and respiratory function. In addition, there may be direct injurious effects of bacterial toxins and circulating cytokines such as triggering of programmed cell death or apoptosis. The neurologic state of a child with sepsis is frequently altered and can range from agitation or irritability to frank obtundation. This depressed mental status can be present even in the absence of meningitis as a manifestation of cerebral hypoperfusion. Skin manifestations are not uncommon and can include petechiae and purpura that are ominous signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and purpura fulminans secondary to meningococcemia. Diffuse erythema secondary to toxic shock syndromes can be present. There is also an increasing appreciation of sepsis-induced microvascular angiopathy contributing to distal skin and organ ischemia. An initial thorough and detailed physical exam provides both important clues to the diagnostic possibilities of pediatric septic shock and the underlying hemodynamic profi le.

The primary goals of therapy in those initial hours following clinical presentation are to maintain oxygenation and ventilation, achieve normal perfusion and blood pressure, and re-establish appropriate urine output for age. Children with sepsis may have altered mental status which, if profound, raises concern about the ability to protect the airway. Tachypnea associated with a primary or compensatory respiratory alkalosis is commonly present. The combination of increased lung vascular permeability and aggressive fl uid resuscitation to restore intravascular volume and maintain blood pressure may contribute to the subsequent development of pulmonary edema. In children with lung edema, the related changes in lung compliance and loss of functional residual capacity can dramatically increase the work of breathing ultimately necessitating tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilatory support. Arterial blood gas analysis may show hypoxemia and metabolic acidosis; however, the decision to provide mechanical ventilatory support should not be based solely on laboratory fi ndings. The presence of increased work of breathing, hypoventilation or obtundation are all indications for instituting mechanical ventilatory support which holds additional benefi t in decreasing the overall oxygen consumption, especially when combined with sedation and paralysis. It should be stated, however, that children with warm shock can commonly be managed without endotracheal intubation so long as they are not obtunded or fl uid overloaded. Disorientation or lethargy with intact responsiveness does not require placement of an artifi cial airway as many institutions manage these patients without intubation. The work of breathing associated with hyperventilation in the absence of pulmonary edema is not clinically signifi cant. Furthermore, there is no evidence that decreasing work of breathing in the presence of distributive shock will result in redistribution of nutrient fl ow to vital organs, the very nature of distributive shock. However, it is more common for infants to present with cardiac dysfunction and pulmonary edema or seriously altered mental status requiring endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. Correction of intravascular volume depletion should be made prior to the institution of positive pressure ventilation. The decrease in venous return after the initiation of positive pressure ventilation may lead to further hemodynamic compromise in the child with intravascular volume depletion. Caution should also be taken in choosing sedative agents for intubation, using agents that have the least impact on tenuous hemodynamics (e.g. ketamine). Controversy exists over the adrenal suppressive effect of a single dose of etomidate when used for intubation in septic children and adults. The pediatric critical care clinician should be aware of the concern for adrenal suppression following a single dose of etomidate used for the intubation of children with septic shock and the published guidelines which do NOT recommend its use in this setting. Following intubation, attention must be paid to matching the mechanically provided minute ventilation to that which was present during spontaneous respiratory effort so that respiratory compensation of acidemia is preserved. If it is deemed that positive pressure ventilation is not needed, supplemental oxygen should be provided to maintain normal oxygen saturations.",

Femoral catheters, in the absence of abdominal pathology, can be used to estimate CVP with good correlation. The CVP measured in the abdominal inferior vena cava must be assessed carefully as a low CVP can be a reliable indicator of hypovolemia, however, a normal or high CVP in the presence of abdominal distention does not automatically exclude the presence of hypovolemia. Multiple adult studies have demonstrated that even an accurate intra-thoracic CVP may be a poor approximation of left ventricular end diastolic pressure and volume. The CVP can be elevated despite the presence of hypovolemia if pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular dysfunction with poor diastolic compliance, tricuspid regurgitation, cardiac tamponade or an intracardiac left-to-right shunt exists. Even though precise determination of the true mixed venous saturation requires the presence of a pulmonary artery catheter, the approximations derived from the SVC saturation have proven a useful target in septic adults. In contrast, because of differences in oxygen extraction between the upper extremities, abdomen, and lower extremities, venous oxygen saturations from a low lying femoral line do not accurately correlate with those measured in the pulmonary artery.

The arterial blood also provides the most accurate measure of arterial oxygen content and can be used to both assess the function of the lungs and to maximize oxygen delivery. In the ventilated patient, variation in the amplitude of the arterial waveform has been found to correlate closely with intravascular volume status (see also Chapter 3 ). Systolic pressure variation (SPV), also referred to as \"reverse pulsus paradoxus,\" is the variation in beat-to-beat amplitude of the arterial pulse during positive pressure ventilation. A single positive pressure breath normally affects the arterial pressure in a biphasic manner. The initial response to a positive pressure breath is to \"squeeze\" pulmonary vascular blood into the left atrium (the opposite, \"pooling\" of blood, occurs with negative pressure inspiration) leading to a rise in systolic pressure. In addition, positive intrathoracic pressure reduces the afterload on the left ventricle by virtue of the pressure gradient from the thorax outward further augmenting this early rise in arterial pressure. These two effects produce an upward movement of the systolic blood pressure coincident with the positive pressure breath, referred to as the D up component of SPV. Following this D up, a fall in systolic pressure occurs a few beats later as the decreased venous return (preload) to the right ventricle that occurred during positive pressure inspiration is now evident as decreased preload to the left ventricle after a few cardiac cycles. The transient reduction in right ventricular volume and output leads to a smaller left ventricular stroke volume and a brief reduction in arterial pressure that occurs later in the ventilator cycle ( D down).",

In this respect, it is important to be familiar not only with the most common causative pathogens, but also the local ICU nosocomial risks and pathogen resistance patterns. Initially, broad antibiotic coverage is initiated. Neonates are most frequently placed on ampicillin and an aminoglycoside (e.g. gentamicin) or a third generation cephalosporin such as cefotaxime. In infants and children over the age of 4-6 weeks, the decision to start vancomycin empirically should be considered in light of the increasing antibiotic resistance of Streptococcus Pneumoniae and rising incidence of community acquired Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA). In addition, a 3rd or 4th generation cephalosporin (e.g. ceftriaxone) should be used. Suspicion of a Gram-negative infection or nosocomial infection requires additional coverage, usually in the form of an aminoglycoside, for the possibility of Pseudmonas species and other resistant Gram-negative organisms. Because of its broad coverage, including many anaerobic species, and low renal toxicity, piperacillin/tazobactam is empirically administered with increasing frequency. The antiviral agent, acyclovir, should be administered if there is suspicion of a herpes virus infection. In immunocompetent children, the decision to start empiric antifungal therapy remains controversial. In the child who is not improving over the initial days of empiric coverage or in whom there is a higher risk for fungal infection (e.g. presence of indwelling devices, immunosuppression or other signifi cant co-morbidities), antifungal coverage may be indicated. The development of agents equally as effective as amphotericin, but with substantially reduced nephrotoxicity such as fl uconazole and caspofungin, may ultimately sway the risk/benefi t analysis towards more aggressive, earlier initiation of empiric antifungal coverage in select, high risk populations. The ability to narrow the spectrum of treatment once the causative organism has been identifi ed will reduce the number of potential side effects and curtail the development of pathogen resistance related to imprudent use of broad spectrum antibiotics.",

While some early adult studies have suggested improved outcomes when achieving supra-normal levels of oxygen delivery, this approach in pediatric sepsis remains unproven. This is likely due to the fact that septic patients may have a perturbed ability to extract oxygen in addition to suboptimal oxygen delivery. Clinically, this impairment in cellular oxygen uptake may be refl ected by an inappropriately high central venous oxygen saturation (S cv O 2 ) in the face of a progressive and therapy refractory acidosis. Optimizing appropriate oxygen delivery remains a clinical goal and incorporates the need for maximizing oxygen carrying capacity. While there is no recommended hemoglobin level for children, the most recent NIH consensus conference suggested a hemoglobin concentration of 10 g/dL for adults with cardiopulmonary compromise as part of a protocol toward achieving the therapeutic goal of S cv O 2 >70%, with improved outcomes demonstrated when this goal was achieved during initial resuscitation. In the context of fl uid loading with blood transfusion, empiric administration of diuretics to eliminate extra fl uid should be avoided until hemodynamic stability has been achieved or if the child exhibits signs of intravascular volume overload defi ned earlier in this chapter.

Intestinal hypoperfusion in combination with absence of local enterocyte nutrition can cause mucosal barrier dysfunction and may contribute to translocation of bacteria and endotoxin from the intestine into the blood stream. While the use of enteral feeding in critical illness has been shown to improve survival and decrease hospital stay, its use must be balanced with the risk of stressing intestinal function in the face of poor splanchnic perfusion, especially in the child requiring the use of vasopressors such as epinephrine and norepinephrine.

Anecdotally, it has been observed that some patients treated with antibiotics appear to acutely worsen in a time frame consistent with the onset of antibiotic activity. This observation has been attributed to massive release of bacterial products following the lysis of high numbers of bacteria. To this end, investigators had shown that animals treated with anti-infl ammatory drugs prior to receiving antibiotics demonstrated a less severe response to bacterial lysis. Despite encouraging preclinical studies, two subsequent large adult trials using high dose steroids early in sepsis showed no improvement in mortality. More recently, studies using lower doses of steroids over a longer period of time have suggested a possible benefi t including a reduced time to cessation of vasopressor therapy. These more recent observations have stimulated a resurgence in the use of corticosteroids in sepsis. Adrenal insuffi ciency is frequently unrecognized in children with septic shock and a low basal circulating cortisol level, especially in association with an abnormal corticotropin stimulation test, has been associated with higher mortality rates. Therefore, identifying \"at risk\" patients with a corticotropin stimulation test and treating this group may improve outcome in sepsis. A study in which adult septic shock patients who were classifi ed as \"nonresponders\" based on corticotropin stimulation results were treated with hydrocortisone and fl udrocortisone for 7 days and had a signifi cantly reduced risk of death. However, this initial observation was not observed in larger follow-up studies. Thus, the use of hydrocortisone and the application of a corticotropin stimulation test in septic patients remains highly controversial. In pediatrics, it is currently recommended that any child with fl uid-and catecholamine-refractory shock (inadequate response to two or more vasoactive agents), has a known history of adrenal insuffi ciency, or has previously received exogenous steroids should be considered for steroid replacement with hydrocortisone (usual dose between 50 and 100 mg/M 2 /day divided every 6 h).",

It is apparent that while a great deal is now understood about the biological and molecular mechanisms involved in sepsis, this knowledge has not yet had a dramatic impact on improving outcome. At present, therapeutic modalities for sepsis remain largely supportive and founded on the fundamental physiologic principle of providing adequate oxygen delivery. With this approach, mortality in pediatric sepsis improved modestly over the past decades. However, the fact that over 4,000 children per year continue to die in association with severe sepsis argues that further advances be made. Realization of the goal of improving survival requires investigators committed to achieving further mechanistic insights into the physiologic, molecular, and genetic biology of sepsis, in concert with large pediatric-specifi c interventional trials. A 5 year old female is admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit with septic shock. She is well oxygenated on a 40% oxygen face mask. She has already received 60 mL/kg of 0.9% normal saline and has been started on a dopamine infusion at a rate of 5 mcg/kg/min. In monitoring her response to these interventions, which of the following should NOT be used as a therapeutic endpoint to monitor her progress? A. Capillary refi ll time B. Echocardiographically measured ejection fraction C. Mental status D. Serum bicarbonate level E. Urine output \u00b3 1 mL/kg/h 10. A 12 year old male with acute lymphocytic leukemia is admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit with vancomycin resistant enterococcus bacteremia. His vital signs reveal a temperature of 39.6\u00b0C, a heart rate of 145 bpm, a respiratory rate of 20 breaths/min, and a blood pressure of 108/35 mm Hg. He is lethargic, but arousable. His pulses are bounding and his capillary refi ll is brisk. An arterial blood gas reveals a pH 7.31, a PaCO 2 33 mm Hg, a PaO 2 65 mm Hg, an oxygen saturation of 93%, and a base defi cit of (\u221210). The oxygen saturation of venous blood sampled from the superior vena cava is 88%.",

The young man is in shock with inadequate oxygen extraction at the tissue level evidenced by the elevated superior vena cava saturation. C. The young man has a primary metabolic acidosis, but has a normal oxygen extraction as oxygen saturation in the superior vena cava is normally higher than elsewhere in the body. D. The young man has a primary metabolic acidosis, but is not in shock, evidenced by his high superior vena cava saturation. E. The young man has a primary respiratory alkalosis that would benefi t from supplemental oxygen therapy.11. There is suffi cient data to justify the use of which of the following adjuvant therapies in pediatric sepsis? A. The administration of activated protein C to a child in septic shock without thrombocytopenia or coagulopathy B. The administration of anti-TNF-a monoclonal antibodies to a septic patient to decrease the proinfl ammatory response C. The administration of stress dose hydrocortisone to a septic patient whose serum cortisol level fails to increase sufficiently in response to a corticotropin stimulation test D. The early initiation of high volume, continuous veno-venous hemofi ltration to remove proinfl ammatory cytokines E. The transfusion of packed red blood cells to maintain a hemoglobin \u00b3 12 g/dL in order to provide supranormal oxygen delivery 12. It has become clear that dysregulation of the coagulation cascade occurs in sepsis as refl ected by activation of procoagulant pathways, consumption of clotting factors, alterations in fi brinolysis, and reduced anticoagulant activity. Which of the following components of coagulation is increased during sepsis? A. Antithrombin III (AT III) B. Plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) C. Protein C D. Protein S E.
