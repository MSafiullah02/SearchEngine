This can be seen as enabling crowdsourcing work to be applied on a sample of large-scale data at high speed, or equivalently, enabling stream processing to employ human intelligence. It also leads to a substantial expansion of the capabilities of data processing systems. Engineering a CSP system requires the combination of human and machine computation elements. From a general systems theory perspective, this means taking into account inherited as well as emerging properties from both these elements. In this paper, we position CSP systems within a broader taxonomy, outline a series of design principles and evaluation metrics, present an extensible framework for their design, and describe several design patterns. We showcase the capabilities of CSP systems by performing a case study that applies our proposed framework to the design and analysis of a real system (AIDR) that classifies social media messages during time-critical crisis events. Results show that compared to a pure stream processing system, AIDR can achieve a higher data classification accuracy, while compared to a pure crowdsourcing solution, the system makes better use of human workers by requiring much less manual work effort.",

            "text": "A significant drawback of traditional stream processing systems is that they rely entirely on automated algorithms of data processing, and as such they are limited by the processing capabilities of these algorithms. Indeed, it is often the case that data stream to be processed is imprecise, highly variable and previously unseen, yet the decision based on this data needs to be made in real-time. In this case, automated processing on its own may produce undesirable results, harming the decision-making process it needs to support. For example, suppose we are interested in monitoring social media to identify messages related to a major crisis event 1 arXiv:1310.5463v3 [cs.DB] 4 Aug 2014 (e.g. an epidemic spreading such as the H1N1 flu pandemic in 2009). The moment this data is issued it needs to be correctly categorized and classified, in order to inform health and policy decisions accurately and on time. Unfortunately, relying only on automated data processing algorithms may not be adequate, firstly because user-generated data in Twitter may partially be erroneous, due to human mistake or intentionally, and secondly because new data may have different characteristics than existing data used to create the algorithms used by the system. In machine learning, this is referred to as the domain adaptation problem, where due to concept drift and other issues, a model trained on one event does not perform well on another. Back to our previous example of epidemic spread detection, a fully automatic stream processing algorithm trained on data from the H1N1 epidemic, may not function correctly on a new epidemic (e.g. the MERS-coronavirus outbreak in 2014), for instance due to the presence of unique vectors (e.g. spread through camels instead of birds) which have not been seen in previous situations. Nevertheless, failing to correctly filter the stream data of the new situation may lead to incorrect conclusions. It therefore becomes apparent that in cases where critical-in terms of cost, time or other valuable resource-decision-making needs to take place in real-time, based on data streams that are potentially noisy and unseen, fully automated stream processing systems do not suffice. Similar scenarios to the above include detecting intrusion or fraud based on anomalous or unusual activities.",

            "text": "Crowdsourcing is a recent computing paradigm that has been used to address the above problems [29] . It refers to utilizing a large number of users (a crowd) to perform a task, by splitting it into several sub-tasks and allocating them to individual workers. Crowdsourcing presents the significant advantage of involving human intelligence; and with it, the ability of humans to categorize, filter and evaluate, often better than automated methods. In fact, crowdsourcing has proven to be better than current computer algorithms in numerous cases, ranging from image recognition and audio transcription to real-time document syntax checking. In our example above, crowdsourcing could make use of the ability of humans to make better sense of a textual message than any algorithm, and in this sense help categorize and disambiguate the information included in a crisis data stream much more effectively. Given that typical crowdsourcing relies entirely on human effort, which inevitably entails the risk for low recognition quality, typical crowdsourcing approaches apply redundancy, i.e. they allocate the same task to multiple workers. This redundancy decreases the throughput and increases the cost of crowdsourced processing. Adding to this problem is the fact that stream processing tasks, unlike other types of input to crowdsourcing, necessitate a very high response rate (throughput) from the crowd. For example, during the Hurricane Sandy a peak rate of 16,000 tweets/minute was observed, and in such case, pure crowdsourcing may easily fail due to human limitations. Summarizing, while fully automated processing may not be appropriate because of errors or quality issues, fully crowdsourced processing may not be appropriate because of processing time (throughput) and cost.",

Certain instances of such systems have recently appeared, requiring different amounts of automated and human involvement, and involving different architectural and design patterns, of which we provide an overview in the next sections. Despite their appeal and necessity, however, no concrete framework exists currently to organize the characteristics, functionalities, architectural patterns and problem cases that CSP systems apply on. As a result, the design of CSPs today is ad-hoc and, at best, intuition-based. A systematic formalization and synthesis of these systems could significantly improve the design and engineering of CSP applications, leading to better designs and to performance improvements of current systems, and guiding the development of new ones. Given the added value and criticality of accurate, fast stream processing, and the abundance of applications that need it, one may easily understand why such systematization is essential. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work attempting to systematize the description and analysis of CSPs through a concrete functional, architectural and evaluation framework.",

These perspectives are supported by notions that include environment, objective, function, element, relation and interface [59] , as illustrated by the system model of Figure 1 , adapted from [59] . Environment is anything outside the system's boundaries. It influences the system as well as the system influences it. Objective is the system's finality at a given time, a notion that directly influences the system's structure and functionality. Function is the set of actions the system can execute in order to realize its objective. Element is a component of a system, which can itself be a system. Finally, Interface is the element through which the system establishes connections with its environment, each system's element having interfaces through which Relations with other elements are established. Environment, objective and function provide the behavioral perspective of the system, i.e. they denote the way the system acts and reacts. Element and interface provide the structural perspective of the system, i.e. they materialize the internal organization and architecture of the system. A CSP is a combination of two systems: a Stream Processing system and a Crowdsourcing system. It keeps the objective of the first, while using the other as a tool to better reach this objective.",

Stream processing systems have important properties which will be evaluated to measure the system performances: latency (the time that it takes for a stream data item to be processed), throughput (the number of items processed/unit time), load adaptability (the response of the system to abrupt changes in the input load), processing quality (processing approximation error and probability of error, in case this system functions on the basis of an approximation algorithm).",

From a structural perspective, a crowdsourcing system is composed of two subsystems interacting one with the other: an information system and the crowd. While the crowd brings along the power of its numbers and a large diversity of knowledge backgrounds, it still remains a human system that can have unpredictable behavior. Thus the crowd's influence on the crowdsourcing system is usually limited to the expected input of the former to the latter, an input that is moderated or filtered when necessary. When the crowd is given more freedom that can influence the functionality of the whole crowd system, more complex regulation mechanisms are put in place [58] .",

            "text": "At a more detailed level, crowdsourcing systems vary significantly in their structure (for comprehensive surveys see [19, 83] ). These variations depend on the application (knowledge or creativity-intensive or more mechanistic), type of input data (homogeneous or heterogeneous) and coordination mode (independent workers, collaboration, competition, mixed). Also, the type of task handled varies greatly from one crowdsourcing system to the other. Among the tasks that workers can execute, we may find: providing input, correcting, validating a given information, comparing, categorizing, but also searching for information, synthesizing knowledge and providing judgments, among others. This leads to prototypical classes of crowdsourcing tasks: binary classification, n-ary classification, and data entry contributions. In binary classification, workers are asked to give a \"yes/no\" answer to a given question, such as \"do these suspicious activities constitute an attack?\" [15] , \"does this entity correspond to this word in this context?\" [16] , \"do these two records correspond to the same person?\" [81] . Examples of n-ary classification, include determining if a word in a sentence represents a person, a place, or an organization [21] , determining if an emergency-related tweet describes infrastructure damage, casualties, injuries, needs, etc. [38] , determining which emotion corresponds to a tweet [49] , performing relevance assessments [2] , determining certain properties of a photo of a galaxy [42] , etc. In data-entry contributions, workers are asked to perform a data-entry task such as: \"rewrite this sentence in a shorter way\" [4] , \"fill in the missing fields in this record\" [23] , \"make a drawing of an articulated figure\" [16] , or provide free-text labels for an image [78] . Binary and n-ary classification tasks are usually more restricted, self-contained and can be more easily split to micro-task level, compared to data-entry ones.",

Then, the crowdsourcing properties that will be usually of concern in the design of a CSP are the crowdsourcing cost (the cost of the work of the people providing the human intelligence) and the quality of the crowd input. Crowdsourced stream processing system (CSP). CSPs lie in the junction between automated stream processing systems and crowd processing systems. They inherit behaviors and structural elements from both, while demonstrating its own emerging properties. What CSPs inherit from stream processing systems is their general objective: to process input From crowdsourcing systems, CSPs inherit the capability of executing data processing tasks that require human intelligence, in contrast to the tasks traditional stream processing systems execute, which can be done by computer algorithms alone. In addition, CSP inherits the uncertainty/variability introduced by human work, and its costs, which necessitates methods and design choices to mitigate it. From a structural perspective a CSP is composed of processing elements (PE), which involve either human or machine elements: crowdsourced PE (CSPE) and automatic PE (APE). These elements can be combined in different ways. We may distinguish two prototypical connection topologies, which generate three possible kind of relations:",

This may help to reduce the number of crowdsourcing calls by selectively using crowdsourcing only for difficult items (e.g. [16, 42] ). Third, automatic elements can be used for automatic task generation, as in the case of systems that need to convert input streams into questions for humans (e.g. graph searching in [64] , crowd-assisted data joins in [23] ).

The processing composition in this system is hybrid (namely, a loop), with the automated element generating entity resolution questions, humans answering them and then these answers being sent back to the automated elements for training and decision purposes. On-demand missing data completion. Crowdsourced processing elements are orchestrated to fill in missing data with respect to a query [23] . Among other operations, in this system crowdsourcing workers complete missing data in tuples that need to be selected or compared with other tuples in response to a query. Queries are not known beforehand, and the underlying dataset can change over time.",

Each resulting design objective is quantifiable through a certain metric, and trade-offs among different objectives may occur, as summarized on Table 3 . The first three objectives (low latency, high throughput and load adaptability) are common in the stream processing literature (e.g. [56, 77] ); while they are not crowdsourcing-specific, we adapt them to the crowdsourced stream processing setting. We do so by indicating how to address each objective in the automatic and crowdsourced components of the system.

According to this, the basic building blocks of stream processing systems are well-defined software components, which perform various kinds of jobs, and can be connected/composed together. Similarly, in the CSP meta-model we find the core elements of a CSP system: one or more processing elements (PE), which can be computer-driven or human-driven (resp. APE or CSPE ). Each PE performs dedicated tasks, and it may depend on other processing elements in terms of data requirements. The PEs are connected through communication flows for data or control, which are modeled using the Data flow and Control flow concepts. The data flow connections tie input ports and output ports. Data items are emitted from their source through a (usually single) output port and they are ingested by the target through (possibly multiple) input ports. Section 4.3 explains this asymmetry. Control connections can also be established to coordinate the behavior between pairs of PEs using (possibly multiple) configuration ports.",

Vukovic [79] categorizes crowdsourcing systems by business-driven objectives, and further distinguish them in regards to their coordination model (marketplace or competitive-based). Lykourentzou et al. [50] distinguishes different user interaction modalities in crowdsourcing: collaborative, competitive, and hybrid. Saxton et al. [69] identify nine basic types which span from social financing to citizen media production models; one of their main conclusions is the need for crowd management which as we describe can be provided by a combination of processing elements, through certain design patterns.",

A number of works provide goal-driven design principles, which focus on the optimization of crowdsourcing systems for a global-level performance target. In this line, Lykourentzou et al. [51] present a stepwise modeling approach for the design of corporate crowdsourcing systems, realized in five decision-making and application steps (define goals, characterize jobs, profile workers, identify constraints and design a crowdsourcing optimization algorithm). Finally, Boutsis and Kalogeraki [9] focus on the process of task-to-worker allocation, and present a framework comprising four components (task management, dynamic assignment, profiling and scheduling), which aims at guaranteeing efficient crowdsourcing system performance under dynamic conditions of the crowdsourcing environment.",
