Importantly, 75% of respondents were in independent practices consisting of fewer than 50 full-time equivalent physicians. The 2017 Society for Vascular Surgery workforce survey, consisting of 714 respondents, found that 44.6% were in academic practice, 23.6% in self-employed private practice, 19.9% in hospital employed private practice, and 12% in a group private practice.2 In the context of this discussion, \u2018independent\u2019 Vascular Surgeons are those in self-employed private practice, group private practice as well in some instances hospital employed private practice depending on how the employment agreement is structured. Although all Vascular Surgeons benefit from recent legislation passed by the U.S. Congress, fund disbursement will be different for academic, employed Vascular Surgeons compared to solo practitioners or those working in legal entities where each Vascular Surgeons has their own Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN). This article will discuss the various resources currently available to Vascular Surgeons.",

Most significantly, the Act provides $100 billion to the Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund, to be used \u201cfor necessary expenses to reimburse, through grants or other mechanisms, eligible health care providers for health care related expenses or lost revenues that are attributable to coronavirus.\u201d3 Of this total, $30 billion is currently being disbursed directly to providers (payments began April 10th) for the purpose of reimbursing expenses and lost revenue related to COVID-19; these funds, which are based on the provider\u2019s share of their 2019 Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) reimbursement,4 do not have to be repaid.5 Note that, these advances (much like the programs other discussed below) will be remitted to the organization whose TIN bills Medicare; consequently, individual physicians would not directly receive these payments.3 As to the remaining $70 billion, the federal government is working to provide targeted provider disbursements to those providers most affected by the pandemic, such as rural providers and providers who provide care to large numbers of Medicaid and uninsured patients.3 Of note, physicians and others employed or their companies owned/ operated by private equity firms will not be eligible for the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP).",
