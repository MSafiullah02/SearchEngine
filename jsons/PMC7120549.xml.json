            "text": "With their pioneering work, Schena and colleagues published a completely outstanding method in molecular technologies in 1995 (Schena et al. 1995). First used for multiparametric transcriptional profiling, the technology rapidly developed toward a tool for the detection of all kinds of biological targets (DNA, RNA, proteins, cells, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, etc.) or their modifications (methylation, phosphorylation, etc.) within the last 20 years. The principle is simple. The biological interaction of molecules, e.g., the interaction of complementary bases of nucleic acids, antibody\u2013antigen interactions, or the interaction of carbohydrates with lectins, represents the basic principle of microarray technology. As an example, in the following, the basic principles of a DNA microarray is described: to detect target molecules, e.g., mRNA or genomic DNA; oligonucleotides complementary to the respective target molecule are immobilized on solid supports like glass, nylon, other polymers, or silicon in an ordered manner\u2014the microarray. These oligonucleotides may correspond to all open reading frames of an organism to allow transcriptional profiling. From the sample of interest, e.g., RNA is extracted and labeled using nucleic acid polymerizing enzymes (e.g., reverse transcriptase, T7 polymerases to generate cDNA) and fluorescently labeled nucleotides. Hybridization to the microarray leads to a specific molecular interaction at the location where the complementary strand is immobilized. Readout using a fluorescence scanner with a photomultiplier tube or imaging with a CCD camera will give the information if the target molecule is present in the analyzed sample or not (Pollack 2009) (Fig. 1). Next to the direct labeling, also indirect labeling techniques can be used. Biotin-labeled nucleotides are incorporated during PCR und afterwards detected using streptavidin or antibody conjugates. One of the first examples was published shortly after the work by Schena et al. (1995) which started the commercialization of nucleic acid microarrays by Affymetrix, USA (Wodicka et al. 1997). Another example is the colorimetric Silverquant\u00ae technology used by Eppendorf for their DualChip\u00ae microarrays. Biotin-labeled nucleotides are used in the PCR reaction. Gold-coupled antibodies against biotin are added after hybridization. The colorimetric reaction is started by adding silver nitrate and a reducing agent. This leads to silver precipitation at the gold particles. Another labeling technology uses a streptavidin\u2013horseradish peroxidase conjugate for colorimetric detection (Rubtsova et al. 2010).\n",

            "text": "Microarray technology has revolutionized both DNA and RNA research. In contrast to most classical biological assays, microarrays enable the parallel analysis of several tens of thousands of analytes. For the analysis of nucleic acids, the application possibilities range from a focused set of multiple transcriptional units for transcriptional profiling or genomic fragments for analysis of copy number or genetic variation up to entire genomes and beyond. The availability of complete genomic sequences was the keystone for the development and use of genome-wide technologies, like array technologies. In the past century, the sequencing of entire genomes has been a major effort both in academic and in commercial research. The first sequenced eukaryotic genome was the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the second completely sequenced genome at all, in 1996. Before 2,000, genome sequencing was a daunting task. In total, the number of sequenced organisms was rather small, including 38 bacteria, 1 fungus (S. cerevisiae), 2 invertebrates (Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster), and 1 plant (Arabidopsis thaliana), all with relatively small and simple genomes. Only 5 years after the first eukaryotic genome was presented, a first draft of the human genomic sequence was published (Lander et al. 2001; Venter et al. 2001). The human draft sequence, although a landmark, was still rather imperfect. It covered only 90 % of the euchromatic genome and was interrupted by 250,000 gaps. About 10 years later, the catalogue of sequenced organisms included already over 16,000 projects, including more than 10,000 microbial organisms and close to 1,700 vertebrate organisms of completed or ongoing sequencing project of organisms (status Sept 2012) (Pruitt et al. 2012). The major reason for this explosion in genome sequencing is due to the development of an additional revolutionizing technology at the beginning of the twenty-first century, generally termed next-generation sequencing (NGS) (Margulies et al. 2005) to which we refer in a later paragraph of this article. At the last NCBI update (October 2013), the number in public archives again increased to 24,788 prokaryotic registered genome projects representing 4,528 different species; 14,311 of them have assembled genomes either complete (2,670) or draft (11,641), and the remainder either do not have submitted sequence data yet or have only raw sequence reads uploaded to the Sequence Reads Archive (Kodama et al. 2012). Sequencing is not restricted to individual organisms any more but includes also microbial communities, like samples from the mid-ocean and environmental remediation sites and human samples from the gut and skin (Grice et al. 2009; Gill et al. 2006). Remarkably, partial genome sequences have even been obtained from several extinct species, including the woolly mammoth and the Neanderthal (Green et al. 2010). In addition populations of one species are sequenced, like in the 100 K Genome Project for microbial pathogens (Timme et al. 2012) and the 1,000 Genomes Project for humans (Genomes Project Consortium et al. 2012). This will enable completely new approaches to medical research and diagnostics, including the development of diagnostic microarrays.",

            "text": "In parallel to the completion of the first genomic sequences, DNA microarray technology has been developed as mentioned above. Pioneering experiments were focused on expression profiling using model organisms like S. cerevisiae to monitor changes of transcriptional activity of every known or annotated gene in a single experiment. For S. cerevisiae, the first genome-wide transcriptional analyses indeed appeared shortly after completion of the genomic sequence (DeRisi et al. 1997; Hauser et al. 1998; Wodicka et al. 1997). On the nucleic acid level, this set the start for genome-wide analyses of organisms based on the knowledge of their genomes. S. cerevisiae as one of the major model organisms was the key in developing both the biochemical and bioinformatic methods necessary for transcriptional profiling. Today, thousands of transcription profiles have been generated from almost all sequenced species. Besides the knowledge of the genome, ways to generate and analyze the data are a prerequisite for transcriptomics. An overview of data analysis methods, however, is beyond the scope of this chapter. Several books on microarray technology and data analysis have been written which introduce perfectly into these topics (Bremer et al. 2010; Dufva 2009). Microarray fabrication, which has been shortly introduced above, will be discussed in the following in more details.",

            "text": "There are three main ways to manufacture DNA microarrays: light-directed synthesis (photolithography), piezoelectric ink-jet printing, and robot spotting (Hughes et al. 2001; Tan et al. 2003; Dufva 2009). For photolithography, premade masks or digital micromirror devices are used. Premade masks are used by the Affymetrix platform. For every nucleotide (nt) added to the growing strand on the solid support, a mask covering regions on the microarray where no base addition should take place is applied. Previous nucleotide blocking groups are removed by a photosensitive reaction after UV light-induced deprotection, and the extension by one further nucleotide can take place. The technology is rather expensive due to mask costs. Every array design needs its own set of masks. Usually, probes are 20\u201325 nt in length, and 22\u201340 probes per gene are synthesized. Another photolithography technology is used by NimbleGen: single-nucleotide extension is performed by light-mediated inactivation of a photolabile protective group and afterward a base addition. This is similar to the Affymetrix technology. However, NimbleGen uses micromirror devices that can lead the light needed for inactivation of protective groups to every desired spot on the microarray. Therefore, there is no need for masks anymore which makes this technology much cheaper. Another technology for making microarrays is the piezoelectric ink-jet printing technology, also called HP technology deduced from HP printing technology. The Agilent sure print technology is an example for an industrial platform. They produce cDNA or oligonucleotide microarrays. cDNA is spotted directly, oligonucleotides are synthesized base-by-base in repetitive print layers using standard phosphoramidite chemistry (https://www.chem.agilent.com/Library/technicaloverviews/Public/5988-8171en.pdf). The most widely used technology for microarray production especially in the field of research institutions and universities is the robot spotting technology: e.g., proteins, PCR products or oligonucleotides are spotted on a solid glass support using split or solid pins. Using split pins, DNA is fed in by capillary forces and deposited at defined locations on the microarray using robot technology. Usually, PCR products up to 1 kb and oligonucleotides between 20 and 100 nts in length are printed. This technology is affordable and therefore often used in individual research labs. Next to these classical technologies, also semiconductor-based systems have been developed. For example, CombiMatrix uses such a system for the production of their microarrays. Thousands of platinum microelectrodes can be addressed simultaneously to synthesize individual oligonucleotides by digitally controlled synthesis. The activation of a microelectrode leads to the production of an acid by an electrochemical reaction. This leads to the deprotection of the growing oligonucleotide strand activating it for the next synthesis step. The possibility to individually address thousands of microelectrodes in parallel allows the comfortable production of individual microarrays (Ghindilis et al. 2007). Over 12,000 oligos are synthesized in parallel as 50 mers.",

            "text": "Not only natural DNA has been used as probes or capture molecules on DNA microarray systems. In order to reduce cross-reactivity and to increase interaction with the targets in the sample applied, nonnatural variants have been used as capture molecules, including l-DNA (Hauser et al. 2006) and PNA variants (Sforza et al. 2014). l-DNA probes have the great advantage that they interact with the exact same kinetics with its antiparallel l-DNA strand, like the d-DNA duplex. Thus, all the knowledge gained with d-DNA-microarrays can be used for the l-DNA equivalent. To bind to targets like RNA, DNA, or even peptides/epitopes or chemical molecules, the so-called ZIP-code arrays are used. The probes used in ZIP-code arrays are fusions in which the targets are bound in solution using, e.g., natural d-DNA oligomer complementary to the target DNA/RNA which is fused to an l-DNA. This l-DNA oligomer addresses an immobilized complementary l-DNA oligonucleotide on the microarray surface, which allows a literally background-free hybridization on the arrays. However, the price for synthesizing l-DNA oligomers is rather high, hampering further development. P-DNAs, synthetic nucleic acid analogues based on a pseudopeptide backbone instead of a phosphodiester backbone, show excellent sequence-specific recognition properties and are less susceptible to changes in ionic strength. Since they are not charged, repulsion between the negatively charged backbone present in DNA duplexes is missing resulting in higher affinities as shown by the higher melting curves of PNA/DNA or PNA/RNA duplexes if compared to their natural counterparts (Brandt and Hoheisel 2004; Jacob et al. 2004; Sforza et al. 2014).",

The beads are marked with different amounts of fluorescent dye or another barcoding technology and are individually identifiable. After coupling, e.g., oligonucleotides to such beads, a specific binding event can be detected. For example Illumina has developed a bead array technology, where they use either planar silicon slides or fiber-optic bundles. Silicon wafers or optical fibers are etched such that the individual beads can fit into the resulting three micron-sized wells. After the binding event, the beads are subsequently identified. This technology uses fluorescently labeled primers http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/genome/probe/doc/TechBeadArray.shtml. Similar to this, suspension arrays also use optically differentiable beads that are coupled to the interesting biomolecule which can be, e.g., oligonucleotides or antibodies. The hybridization reaction with fluorescently labeled substrates takes place in solution, and a subsequent FACS (fluorescence-activated cell sorting) sorting process allows the identification of the binding process. An example is the Luminex xMAP technology (http://www.luminexcorp.com/TechnologiesScience/xMAPTechnology/).",

Since the probes were designed against conserved sequences common to a taxonomic family, it could be used to identify novel viruses within the same family. The ViroChip, therefore, could contribute to characterizing the novel coronavirus responsible for the SARS outbreak in 2003 (Ksiazek et al. 2003). Also today the ViroChip is still used in clinical studies. Its utility for detection of viruses in acute respiratory tract infections in children could be shown in a clinical study of more than 200 children, showing superior performances with regard to sensitivity and specificity profile and expanded spectrum for detection of viruses if compared to serologic or PCR-based detection methods (Chiu et al. 2008).

Breast cancer has been one of the most intensively studied human cancers, with regard to microarray-based gene expression profiling for cancer classification, prognosis, and prediction. One of the reasons for this, besides the high frequency of breast cancer in the population, is the observation that although approximately 60 % of all patients with early breast cancer receive some form of chemotherapy, only a minority will benefit from it (Schmidt et al. 2009). Therefore, reliable prognostic and predictive markers are needed to guide the selection of the most appropriate adjuvant therapies for individual patients with breast cancer. Microarrays actually contributed significantly to a change in the understanding of breast cancer as a heterogenous group of complex tumors instead of a single group. Pioneering work by Perou and colleagues rediscovered the large heterogeneity of breast cancer tumors on a molecular level (Perou et al. 2000). The demonstration that ER-positive and ER-negative tumor cells are fundamentally different in their expression profiles led to the suggestion to use microarray-based multigene prognostic classifiers, known as gene signatures or diagnostic signatures, as a prognostic/predictive marker panel for therapy decisions. In the last decade, several groups have embarked in the identification of gene signatures for breast cancer diagnostics with the goal to predict if chemotherapy can be omitted in early-stage breast cancer or select the most appropriate treatment. One of the first prognostic signatures consisted of 70 genes enabling the identification of good prognosis patients with a minimal risk of developing of metastases within the next 5 years (van \u2019t Veer et al. 2002). This 70-gene signature has been validated in several clinical trials, in general using fresh biopsy tissue for preparation of the transcriptional profiles during the last years and is now commercially available via Agendia as MammaPrint\u00ae (using Microarrays based on Agilent technology) for guided therapy of early-stage breast cancer (Exner et al. 2014). In parallel, a gene signature consisting of 16 diagnostic genes (and 5 controls) was established, based on qRT-PCR (Oncotype DX) (Paik et al. 2004). This assay also underwent several clinical trials and was recently positively evaluated for economic impact on patient management (Nerich et al. 2014). Several other assays have been developed, which are nicely reviewed by Colombo et al. and by Zanotti et al. (Colombo et al. 2011; Zanotti et al. 2014).",

            "text": "Noncoding RNAs, especially microRNAs, have been described in the last decade as key developmental regulators (Bushati and Cohen 2007). Therefore, considerable efforts have been made to unravel the function of miRNAs and use them as diagnostic markers, especially in cancer (Jansson and Lund 2012; Zhang et al. 2014) but also in other diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases (Gandhi et al. 2013), cardiovascular diseases (Ellis et al. 2013), and infectious diseases (Shrivastava et al. 2013). Detection of small noncoding RNAs like microRNAs is a challenge, since they are very short in their mature form, containing neither cap nor poly(A) tails naturally and in addition to the mature form exist in a pri-form and a preform which are processed and transported out of the nucleus by a complex sequence of events as reviewed nicely by Bartel (Bartel 2004). Several systems have been described which enable microRNA detection on a microarray platform. For example, Agilent has developed such a platform including a special labeling technology which enables the detection of miRNAs for tissue or formalin-fixed biopsy material (D\u2019Andrade and Fulmer-Smentek 2012). The profiling of different miRNA maturation levels in parallel is important for a comprehensive cancer classification (O\u2019Hara et al. 2008). Therefore, it is desirable to distinguish between mature, pri- and preforms. Since the mature miRNA is also part of the preforms the available microarray systems in general are not able to distinguish between premature and mature miRNAs without costly size exclusion or approximate data analysis. However, using a ZIP-code array system together with a defined labeling approach, a system enabling the distinction between pre-miRNAs and their mature form was described recently by Weishaupt et al. (Weishaupt et al. 2013). By labeling all forms of miRNAs with a poly(A) tail, they can distinguish between miRNA containing still a precursor sequence and a mature miRNA containing the poly(A) tail in direct proximity to the mature sequence. This is done by using primer extension reactions in combination with two distinct ZIP-code primers hybridizing to the mature miRNA targeted and the specific complementary ZIP on the array. The two ZIP-code primers are used for two distinct labeling reactions containing (1) only unlabeled dTTP together with Cy3-dUTP in the labeling reaction allowing for the detection of the mature form and (2) unlabeled dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP together with Cy3-dATP in the labeling reaction for the detection of the precursor form as shown in Fig. 2. Combining both labeling reactions on one array, we can now identify via the specific complementary ZIP code the amount of both the premature and mature miRNA. This is possible because the precursor miRNA is the only species which is able to carry labeled dATP, since the poly(A) tail directly following the mature form does not allow the integration of dATP into the mature form (for labeling reaction see Fig. 2), and the mature miRNA is the only species which is able to contain Cy3-dUTP via the poly(A) tail. The label reaction has to be performed separately to achieve this and is mixed on one array for readout. Using a set of well-defined, evaluated ZIP-code primers a quantitative readout could be demonstrated.\n",

            "text": "There are several manual steps in diagnostics with DNA microarrays from sample to result like nucleic acid extraction, amplification or reverse transcription, labeling, hybridization, data readout, and data analysis. Each step is a potential risk for contamination and mistakes. One possibility to overcome these limitations is automation by using so-called micro total analysis systems (\u03bcTAS) or lab-on-a-chip devices (LoC) that allow for a complete sample preparation, analysis, and readout in a single closed device. In such microfluidic devices \u03bc-, nano-, or even picoliter volumes are transported through micrometer-sized channels and are filtered, mixed, further processed, and detected. Fluid transport is often pressure-driven but alternatively also induced by electroosmotic flow or capillary forces. Complete automation harbors several advantages like getting by with smaller sample volumes, diminished contamination risk, faster assay processing due to small diffusion ways, efficient thermodynamics, and favorable surface-to-volume ratio as well as multiplex- and high-throughput capabilities. The implementation of complete processes from sample to result in LoC devices, however, is complex. First, one has to implement single functional units that in the end have to be combined to run in concert in one complete process. Challenges next to others are the choice of the material that has to be compatible to all assay steps, the assembly process, and the modification of the biological assay for maximal compatibility. Many research institutions are working on the development of LoC devices. Reviewing these, however, is beyond the scope of this review. The focus lies on array-based LoC devices that found or may find their way into the clinical routine laboratory.",

Cell lysis is done in a separate processing unit. All other steps (purification, amplification, and detection) are then performed in a single cartridge. The Curetis technology can be used to diagnose infections. CE-certified cartridges are offered for the detection of pathogens and resistance markers for pneumonia (Unyvero\u2122 P50) and implant and tissue infections (Unyvero\u2122 i60 ITI). FDA clearance is aspired. Another complete solution with array-based detection is developed by Nanosphere. Their Verigene system allows for the simple testing of nucleic acid and protein on a single platform (http://www.nanosphere.us/technology). For the detection of DNA or RNA targets, nanoparticle probe technology is used. Automated nucleic acid extraction and PCR amplification from a clinical sample take place on the Verigene\u00ae Processor SP. Eluted nucleic acids are transferred automatically into a Verigene Test Cartridge for hybridization of target DNA to capture oligonucleotides on a microarray. Detection is realized by specific mediator oligonucleotides and gold nanoparticle probe; the signal amplification of hybridized probes is done via a silver staining process. Automated qualitative analysis of results is performed on the Verigene Reader. Diseases like bacterial infections or cardiac tests are addressed. Rheonix (http://www.rheonix.com/technology/technology-overview.php) develops the Encompass platform. Disposable cards with onboard reagents and a low-density microarray- or qPCR-based detection system are the heart of the system.

Cepheid (http://www.cepheid.com/us/) has developed an integrated benchtop analyzer (GeneXpert) for the detection of several pathogens and resistance markers. They have a microfluidic cartridge where ultrasonic lysis and multiplex rapid real-time PCR technique are realized. The company has CE-certified cartridges for the detection of, e.g., Clostridium difficile (C. difficile), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), or norovirus and FDA-approved tests for, e. g., MRSA or tuberculosis. Focus Diagnostics (http://www.focusdx.com/3m-integrated-cycler/ud-intl) developed the 3M\u2122 Integrated Cycler for a disk-based qPCR-based analytical system. 96 samples can be run in parallel. Assays are offered for the detection of viral-caused infections like dengue fever, influenza, and infectious mononucleosis (Epstein\u2013Barr virus) or for the detection of bacteria like Bordetella species or C. difficile. Idaho Technologies [now BioFire (Biomerieux)] develops a product series based on the FilmArray\u00ae (Poritz et al. 2011). This novel diagnostic platform combines automated sample preparation, nucleic acid extraction, and PCR-based detection of multiple targets from a single unprocessed sample in 1 h. It combines nesting and multiplexing of the PCR (referred to here as nested multiplex or \u201cnmPCR\u201d) together with DNA melting curve analysis to detect and distinguish multiple pathogens simultaneously. The FilmArray and the FilmArray Respiratory Panel (RP) pouch have since received FDA clearance for use as an in vitro diagnostic (IVD) device. Advanced Liquid Logic (http://www.liquid-logic.com/technology) which was acquired by Illumina in July 2013 has a digital microfluidic technology that is based on the use of electrowetting to precisely manipulate droplets on a surface. For electrowetting, a voltage is applied between a droplet and an insulated electrode that can cause the droplet to spread on the surface and allows the precise manipulation of droplets within a sealed microfluidic LoC. Illumina is mainly interested to deliver the simplest and most efficient sample-to-answer next-generation sequencing (NGS) workflow (press release). DNA Electronics (http://dnae.co.uk/technology/overview/) develops electronic-based microchip solutions for DNA and RNA detection. An ion-sensitive field effect transistor (ISFET) is used for genotyping or semiconductor-based sequencing. Whenever DNA or RNA is amplified, a H+ ion is released that can be detected by the ISFET. Therefore, specific hybridization events can be detected. Addressed healthcare applications are in the field of personalized medicine and infection screening. Another sensor technology is developed by GeneFluidics. The technology enables quantification of nucleic acids and proteins on a single platform with electrochemical detection. High sensitivity even in unamplified, unpurified biological samples is advertised. Results are delivered within 1 h. Sensor surfaces are functionalized by antibodies or DNA. After the binding event and washing steps, a secondary antibody with HRP (reporter enzyme binding) is applied. Signals occurring during enzymatic conversion of HRP substrate are proportional to the analyte concentration (http://www.genefluidics.com/technology). HandyLab, acquired by BD in 2009, developed disposable cartridges with onboard dry reagents and patented real-time microfluidic PCR technology. Cartridges could be run in a benchtop instrument that integrated heating, mechanical valves for fluid control, and fluorescent detection. FDA-approved tests were available for MRSA, C. difficile, and group B Streptococci. These tests and one further test (vancomycin-resistant Enterococci) were approved for use in Europe. Another interesting and completely different system is the lab-in-a-tube system (Liat\u2122 system) by IQuum (http://www.iquum.com/products/technology.shtml). All assay reagents are prepacked in tube segments separated by peelable seals in the Liat. The Liat is compressed by sample processing actuators of the Liat analyzer so that reagents are selectively released from tube segments, the sample is moved from one segment to another, and reaction conditions are controlled. You can start with a variety of sample matrices, including whole blood, plasma, urine, and swab samples. All required assay processes, including reagent preparation, nucleic acid purification, amplification, and real-time detection, are performed by the analyzer in 20 min\u20131 h, depending on the assay. Rapid PCR amplification and real-time detection are integrated. Products are the Liat\u2122 Influenza A/2009 H1N1 Assay (research use only), a fully automated sample-to-result detection of viral RNA in 26 min that received FDA Emergency Use Authorization in 2009 (since expired), and the Liat\u2122 Influenza A/B Assay (IVD product). Assays for HIV, CMV, influenza subtypes, and dengue are in the product pipeline.",

The discussion of these impressive technological approaches summed up as next-generation sequencing (NGS) approaches is not in the scope of this review. A nice overview is given, e. g., in (Voelkerding et al. 2009). Since then, several other high-throughput sequencing technologies have been developed. One example is the semiconductor-based nonoptical sequencing system by Ion Torrent/Life Technologies. A pH-shift occurring during incorporation of desoxy-nucleotides in the growing strand is monitored by an ion-sensitive field effect transistor (Rothberg et al. 2011). Today, even single molecule sequencing is possible (Pacific Biosciences; http://www.pacificbiosciences.com/), and technologies are being developed that could allow the sequencing of whole genomes through nanopores within the shortest time (announced e. g. by Oxford Nanopore Technologies; https://www.nanoporetech.com/).",

            "text": "Interestingly, a combination of microarrays and next-generation sequencing has been established. In order to focus on the most relevant part of the human genome for SNP detection, exome sequencing can be performed instead of using genotyping arrays. In exome sequencing, all coding sequences of the human genome are sequenced to identify variants between individuals. Approximately 180,000 exons comprising 30 million base pairs are reported which constitute about 1 % of the human genome (Directors ABo 2012). Focusing on mutations in the exons which are much more likely to cause an effect, the sequencing effort can be reduced by two orders of magnitude, if the exons can be enriched efficiently. Several enrichment methods are described (Lin et al. 2012). One of them uses DNA microarrays containing all complementary sequences of exons. For example, Nimble Gene developed a so-called Sequence Capture Human Exome 2.1 M Array to enrich all ~180,000 coding exons (Choi et al. 2009). Exome sequencing can be used as an approach to identify unknown causal genes for rare Mendelian disorders (Ng et al. 2009, 2010). The advantage of the sequencing technology is that it does not require any preexisting knowledge\u2014one gets every mutation present\u2014and not only the SNPs represented on the array. The challenge in this case is the specific sequence enrichment and to generate the know-how about the effect of the individual SNPs detected or their combination on human well-being. The first company making exome sequencing available for diagnostic purposes is Ambry. They introduced the Clinical Diagnostic Exome\u2122. The company also offers more than 300 highly specialized genetic tests (http://www.ambrygen.com/clinical-diagnostics).",

NGS has the capacity to replace Sanger sequencing by targeted genomic NGS (Sikkema-Raddatz et al. 2013). Using this approach, only subsets of genes that are known to be important and involved in a special disease are sequenced. Sikkema-Raddatz et al. constructed a targeted enrichment kit that includes 48 genes associated with hereditary cardiomyopathies and demonstrated that targeted NGS of a disease-specific subset of genes is equal to the quality of Sanger sequencing using the Illumina MiSeq sequencer (Sikkema-Raddatz et al. 2013). They state that it can therefore be reliably implemented as a stand-alone diagnostic test. Illumina offers the MiSeqDx Cystic Fibrosis (CF) 139-Variant Assay that detects 139 clinically relevant CFTR (CF-transmembrane conductance regulator) variants and the MiSeqDx Cystic Fibrosis Clinical Sequencing Assay that accurately captures all variants in the protein-coding regions and intron/exon boundaries of CFTR (Grosu et al. 2014). These are the first FDA-cleared NGS-based assays and kits for in vitro diagnostic use on the MiSeqDx instrument (http://www.illumina.com/clinical/diagnostics.ilmn).",

Clinical diagnostics requires easy-to-handle experimental procedures, robustness, accuracy, sensitivity, and comparable or lower costs compared to existing diagnostic approaches. Although, recent developments in NGS have led to small instruments that allow flexible throughput and short run times, current drawbacks of NGS approaches are their high investment and running cost, elaborate library preparation, and complex data analysis. Detached from these shortcomings, with the possibilities of NGS, novel diagnostic scales are thinkable not only for diagnostics of cancer, mitochondrial disorders, or hereditary diseases where the assay time is in general not critical but also for assays in clinical microbiology like the detection of MRSA or sepsis causative organisms. Within the scientific community, workshops and symposiums are held everywhere dealing with the topic how NGS can be validly used for clinical diagnostics. The FDA also looks deeper into this subject and performs public workshops that focus on the evaluation of the use of NGS technologies for clinical diagnostics (e.g., Ultra High Throughput Sequencing for Clinical Diagnostic Applications\u2014Approaches to Assess Analytical Validity: Report from the Public Meeting (June 23, 2011), http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/NewsEvents/WorkshopsConferences/ucm284442.htm and Public Workshop\u2014Advancing Regulatory Science for High Throughput Sequencing Devices for Microbial Identification and Detection of Antimicrobial Resistance Markers, April 1, 2014, http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/NewsEvents/WorkshopsConferences/ucm386967.htm).

A great portfolio of excellent research has been done in the field not only dealing with the molecular interaction but also with data analysis or automation of assay steps. Although developed nearly 20 years ago, the technology until now didn\u2019t really find its way into routine clinical laboratory diagnostics. Only a few arrays are used for such applications as described above. As the main reasons for this, the high complexity of the technology, missing robustness, accuracy, and sensitivity are discussed. Microarray procedures require many complex, often manual, steps that are prone to errors and need skilled staff and expensive equipment for processing. One way to overcome these shortcomings might be automation of the process steps using LoC devices that allow for a convenient and reproducible processing of patient samples with minimized risk for handling errors or contamination. Diagnostic assays beginning from sample preparation up to and including data readout and processing can be easily performed using such systems. This might be the most promising path for microarrays to find their way into clinical laboratory diagnostics at a larger scale.",
