Initial attention should focus most urgently on infections that are treatable, transmissible, and that cause serious sequelae or death.1., 2.

Among 336 travelers and migrants in Switzerland who presented to an outpatient clinic with a history of fever or malaise and who had blood tests for malaria, 29% had laboratory confirmation of malaria.11 In a study of 153 pediatric patients hospitalized with febrile illness after tropical travel, diarrheal illness (27%) and malaria (14%) were the most common diagnoses; a treatable infection was identified in 46%.12 Infections, such as respiratory tract infections, hepatitis, diarrheal illness, urinary tract infections and pharyngitis, with a broad or worldwide distribution, accounted for more than half of fevers in some series7., 8., 12. and the cause of fever remained undefined in about one-quarter of cases. Specific agents most often identified, in addition to malaria, include dengue fever, hepatitis A, rickettsial infections, streptococcal pharyngitis, typhoid fever, gastrointestinal infections (caused by Campylobacter, salmonella, shigella) and amebic liver abscess. In the GeoSentinel database, among ill-returned travelers with a confirmed or probable diagnosis, malaria was the most common specific agent identified in travelers with a systemic febrile illness.5\n",

In many developing countries, hepatitis A is not viewed as an important problem. Clinical disease is largely unknown because most children are infected at a young age when infection is mild and often unrecognized. Older children and adults are immune, but the virus regularly contaminates food and water and poses a threat to non-immune travelers who enter the area. Katayama syndrome, an immune-complex mediated disease, is seen in travelers and persons newly infected with schistosomiasis but not in residents of endemic areas who have been repeatedly exposed to the parasite.13\n",

Remote travel is sometimes relevant but most severe, acute life-threatening infections result from exposures that have occurred within the past 3 months. Important treatable infections that may occur >3 months after return include malaria, amebic liver abscess and visceral leishmaniasis. In the study by O'Brien et al.9 that analyzed hospitalized patients with fever after travel, 96% were seen within 6 months of return from travel. Although the initial focus should be on travel within the past 3\u20136 months, the history should extend to include exposures a year or more earlier, if the initial investigation is unrevealing. More than one-third of malaria-infected travelers in a study from Israel and the USA had illness that developed more than 2 months after return from endemic areas.15 Onset of illness >1 year after return occurred in <2% of malaria patients reported to the CDC in 2003.16\nTable 53.2\nlists many of the infections seen in travelers by time of onset of symptoms relative to the exposure and the initial clinical presentation.

It is increasing in incidence in endemic areas and is an increasingly common cause of fever in returned travelers.21., 22., 23. Dengue is found in tropical and subtropical regions throughout the world. Among travelers, dengue is seen most often in visitors to SE Asia and Latin America (including the Caribbean) and infrequently in travelers to Africa. Because humans are the main reservoir for the dengue virus, which is transmitted primarily by the Aedes aegypti mosquito that inhabits urban areas and lives in close association with humans, travelers visiting only urban areas can become infected. Symptoms of dengue, also known as breakbone fever, typically begin 4\u20137 days (range 3\u201314 days) after exposure. Common findings are fever, frontal headache, and myalgia. Approximately 50% of patients have skin findings, which can be a diffuse erythema or a maculopapular or petechial eruption. Intense itching may be present toward the end of the febrile period. Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated transaminases are common laboratory findings. The most serious forms of infection, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) occur primarily in persons who have a second dengue infection with a different serotype. This helps explain why these complications are rare among travelers. In a well-characterized outbreak in Cuba, 98.5% of DHF/DSS cases were in persons with a prior dengue infection. The attack rate of DHF/DSS was 4.2% in persons with prior dengue infection who became infected with a new serotype.24\n",

Leptospirosis, meningococcemia, and other bacterial infections can cause hemorrhage. Rickettsial infections can produce a petechial rash or purpura, and severe malaria may be associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation. Many viral infections, in addition to dengue, can cause hemorrhage. Most are arthropod-borne (especially mosquito or tick) or have rodent reservoir hosts. Among those reported in travelers are dengue fever (DHF), yellow fever, Lassa fever, Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever, Rift Valley fever, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (and other Hantavirus-associated infections), Kyasanur Forest disease, Omsk hemorrhagic fever, and several viruses in South America (Junin, Machupo, Guanarito, Sabia). Other geographically focal infections can cause hemorrhagic fever and would be expected primarily in travelers who visit rural or remote areas. Lassa fever responds to ribavirin therapy if started early. Several of the viruses can be transmitted during medical care, so it is important to institute barrier isolation in a private room pending a specific diagnosis. Identification of viral agents causing hemorrhage may require assistance from staff working in special laboratories, such as one available at CDC.

Pilgrims vaccinated with the quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine (serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y) can still carry N. meningitidis. Dengue fever can cause neurological findings that mimic Japanese encephalitis. In a study in Vietnam, dengue-associated encephalopathy was found in 0.5% of 5400 children admitted with DHF.46 Meningitis may be present in leptospirosis. The parasite Angiostrongylus cantonensis causes sporadic infection in many countries and was responsible for an outbreak of eosinophilic meningoencephalitis in travelers to Jamaica in 2000.47 African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness), transmitted by an infective tsetse fly, initially causes a non-specific febrile illness. A chancre marks the site of the bite. If untreated, trypanosomes can infect the CNS and cause lethargy. Several cases have been seen in travelers after exposures, especially in Tanzania and Kenya. Patients with malaria, typhoid fever, and rickettsial infections often have severe headache, but CSF is typically unremarkable in these infections. Cerebral malaria causes altered mental status and can progress to seizures and coma. Mefloquine taken for malaria chemoprophylaxis has rarely been associated with seizures and other neuropsychiatric side-effects but fever typically is absent.

Among those that may be a concern, depending on geographic exposures, are yellow fever, dengue and other hemorrhagic fevers, typhoid fever, leptospirosis, rickettsial infections, toxoplasmosis, Q fever, syphilis, psittacosis, and brucellosis. Transaminases are often elevated in these infections. Parasites that directly invade the liver and bile ducts (e.g. amebic liver abscess and liver flukes) often cause right upper quadrant pain, tender liver and elevated alkaline phosphatase. Drugs and toxins (sometimes found in herbal drugs or nutritional supplements) can damage the liver so a careful review of these agents should be part of the history.",

When it is found in a person who has visited or lived in tropical, developing countries, it is a clue that should suggest several specific parasitic infections.57 Before beginning an extensive work-up to look for parasites, however, it is important to review carefully the general medical history for other processes that may be associated with eosinophilia and to review drug history (including drugs received during travel, over-the-counter drugs and drugs that may have been given by injection during travel). Many parasitic infections are not associated with eosinophilia or may be associated with eosinophilia only during one stage of development. Infections that can cause both eosinophilia and fever include acute schistosomiasis (Katayama syndrome), trichinosis, fascioliasis, gnathostomiasis, lymphatic filariasis, tropical pulmonary eosinophilia, toxocariasis, and loiasis. Many of these helminthic infections are seen primarily in persons with prior residence or prolonged stays in tropical developing countries. Acute coccidioidomycosis, resolving scarlet fever, and a few other non-helminthic infections may also be associated with eosinophilia, but in these infections eosinophilia usually is not high grade or persistent. The protozoan infections, malaria, amebiasis, giardiasis, and leishmaniasis, are not associated with eosinophilia.",

Outside resources, such as CDC or other reference laboratories with special expertise may be needed to provide diagnostic studies or other support. Familiar infections (e.g. salmonella, Campylobacter, gonorrhea) may be caused by multi-drug resistant organisms. It is especially important to recognize the potential for multi-drug resistance in infections, such as typhoid fever, that can be lethal. Absence of response to what should be appropriate treatment should lead the clinician to consider drug resistance, the possibility of the wrong diagnosis, or presence of two infections. A number of case reports document the simultaneous presence of malaria and typhoid fever, amebic liver abscess and hepatitis A, and other dual infections.59., 60.\n",
