COVID-19 rapidly swept mainland China and spread worldwide, causing 118,319 confirmed cases and 4,292 deaths in 113 nations as of March 11, 2020. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic [3]. In the Republic of Korea, starting with a Chinese traveler from Wuhan in January 20 [4], 7,755 confirmed cases leading to 60 deaths have occurred as of March 11, 2020 [5].",

The youngest affected patient was a 36-hour-old newborn, who remains the youngest COVID-19 patient worldwide [12].

After 7 days of hospitalization of the infant, his father complained of fever and fatigue, while his mother was asymptomatic; both of his parents showed signs of pneumonia on the chest CT scan and had positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR results. It was undetermined whether the incubation period was shorter in the infant than in the parents or the virus was transmitted from the infant to the parents [9,35]. In the first severe case of a 13-month-old who developed pneumonia, shock, acute respiratory distress, and renal failure, the source of infection could not be identified.

Of 147 (64 confirmed, 82 suspected, and 1 asymptomatic) preg nant women investigated, 8% had severe signs consisting of dyspnea and hypoxemia, while 1% was critical and requir ed intensive care [6]. However, pneumonia is one of the most common infections during pregnancy, as it may lead to pre mature rupture of the membranes, preterm labor, intrauterine growth retardation, and stillbirth [37-39]. Sporadic case reports on COVID-19 in pregnant women observed obstetric complications including stillbirth, preterm birth, and premature rupture of the membranes [40-43]. In a study of 9 pregnant women with COVID-19 diagnosed in Wuhan, China, from January 20 to 31, 2020, all women were infected at gestational age 36 weeks or later and delivered by caesarean section. Seven women complained of fever at the time of diagnosis, but none developed severe pneumonia that led to mechanical ventilation or death. Obstetrical complications included preterm deliveries in 4 and premature rupture of the membranes in 2; no cases of neonatal asphyxia or stillbirth were observed. From 6 patients, amniotic fluid, cord blood, breast milk, and neonatal throat swab samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2; all were negative [40]. A case report from Suzhou, China, described a pregnant woman at 30-week gestation. She was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia on February 6, 2020 and delivered a 1.83-kg preterm baby via emergency caesarean section due to fetal distress. SARS-CoV-2 PCR of the amniotic fluid, placenta, cord blood, neonatal gastric juice, and neonatal throat swab was negative [41]. A study analyz ing 13 pregnant women with COVID-19 from December 8, 2019 to February 25, 2020 in mainland China outside of Wuhan included 2 women in their second trimester. Ten women had fever, 3 had dyspnea, and 1 was asymptomatic. Of the 13 women, 3 (23%) recovered and were discharged with uncom plicated ongoing pregnancy; 10 delivered by caesarean section. Five women underwent emergency caesarean section due to fetal distress (3 cases), premature rupture of membrane (1 case), and stillbirth (1 case). Six women had preterm labor. At 34-week gestation, one of the women developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure requiring extra corporeal membrane oxygenation support; her baby was still birth [42].",

Limited information is available on this previously unknown coronavirus that has been around for less than 3 months. It is known that children comprise a small fraction of COVID-19 cases, and their symptoms are often mild. However, some pediatric cases may progress to severe disease, and initial atypical presentations may delay the diagnosis of COVID-19, leading to unfavorable outcomes. It is worth mentioning that newborns are susceptible to this disease and viruses are detected for a prolonged period; therefore, newborns might play a role in community transmission. There is currently no standard of management or prevention. Further investigation is needed to assess the reason for differences in clinical features of COVID-19 by age, evaluate the role of children in community transmission, and develop treatment and vaccines for the disease. We hope that current and future research on COVID-19 can answer these questions and look forward to wisely managing this crisis for mankind.",
