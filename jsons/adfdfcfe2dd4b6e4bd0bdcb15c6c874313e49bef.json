            "text": "Adult articular cartilage lacks significant regenerative capacity, and damage to this tissue often leads to progressive joint degeneration (osteoarthritis). We developed strategies to generate articular cartilage from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) as a source of clinically relevant tissues for joint repair 1 . Previously, we demonstrated that these chondrocytes retain cartilage forming potential following subcutaneous implantation in mice. In this report, we evaluated the potential of human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived articular cartilage tissue to repair osteochondral defects created in the rat knee. Following implantation, the hESCderived cartilage maintained a proteoglycan and type II collagen-rich matrix, and was well integrated with native rat tissue at the basal and lateral surfaces. The ability to generate cartilage tissue with integrative and reparative properties from an unlimited and robust cell source represents a significant clinical advance for cartilage repair that can be applied to large animal models and ultimately to patient care.",

Absence of human cells in some of the defects was likely due to delamination of the tissue upon implantation, an inherent risk of this type of study 3 . Defects containing hESC-derived tissues contained significant regions of proteoglycan-and type II collagen-rich cartilage tissue after 6 and 12 weeks ( Figure 1I -P). In contrast, control defects generally lacked proteoglycans and type II collagen, but were enriched for type I collagen, indicating the presence of fibrocartilage-like tissue ( Figure 1R , T). Type I collagen was also present in host tissue at the periphery of the human tissue implant and at the articular surface ( Figure 1Q , S). Type X collagen, a marker of chondrocyte hypertrophy, was present in 5 of the 11 defects at 6 weeks and 1 of 6 defects at twelve weeks (representative defects shown in Figure 1U and 2F), with the highest levels localizing to the subchondral interface between implant and host tissue.",

Implanted defects also had significantly higher scores in matrix staining, cell morphology, and middle/deep zone assessment at both 6 and 12 weeks. Scores for tidemark formation and vascularization significantly increased from 6 weeks to 12 week in defects receiving implants, while scores for matrix staining, cell morphology, middle/deep zone, and overall assessment significantly decreased in control defects over time ( Figure 1Z -BB, Supplementary Figures 1 and 2) .

            "text": "Evidence of integration and remodeling of hESC-derived cartilage implants in the rat knee. Three representative defects are shown from two different animals at 6 weeks postimplantation (A-G) and one animal at 12 weeks post-implantation (H-M). Defect 1 (A, B) shows cartilage implant congruent with the native rat cartilage at the articular surface. Defect 2 shows cartilage implant encased within subchondral bone (C-G). An arrow indicates likely orientation of remodeling (A, C). hESC-derived cartilage implants stain positively with Safranin O (A, C, H, K) and type II collagen (B, D, J, M). Type I collagen/bone matrix (E) was found directly adjacent to the human tissue in Defect 2. Human cells (RFP-positive, G) were identified only within the calcified cartilage regions marked by type II (D) and type X (F) collagen, and were not found in the adjacent bone tissue (E). Representative Defect 3 at 12 weeks post implantation shows basal and lateral integration of hESC-derived cartilage tissue implant in the absence of bone formation (H-M). The Safranin O-positive hESC-derived cartilage implant was congruent with the surrounding native rat cartilage (H, K). Human cells, identified by the expression of RFP, were laterally integrated within the host rat tissue (I, L, arrows). Note the uninterrupted type II collagen network between the hESC-derived cartilage implant and the native rat cartilage (J, M). Scale bar represents 250 \u00b5m (A, B), 50 \u00b5m (C-G; K-M), 100 \u00b5m (H-J). Abbreviations: r, rat; h, human.",
