It has previously been demonstrated as a natural suppressor of innate inflammatory and immune responses in vitro and in animal studies 21, 22, 23. Our data may suggest that IL\u201037 may inhibit IFN\u2010\u03b3 expression as shown previously with T regulatory cells 24. In agreement, we showed low\u2010to\u2010moderate positive correlation between IL\u201037 and IL\u201010, IL\u201017 and FOXP3. Our findings on IL\u201037 expression, the independent positive association with atopic dermatitis and nonindependent positive association with virus infection, could imply that an inflammatory state in general, not just a viral infection, is likely to increase the expression of IL\u201037 similar to IL\u201010 expression 17. Several isoforms of IL\u201037 exist, but our primer set covered them all. Moreover, IL\u201037 is produced as a precursor that needs to be activated by caspase 1 21; therefore, the relationship between mRNA expression of IL\u201037 and biological activity is not necessarily direct.",

This finding may help to explain the role of IL\u201013 in virus\u2010induced exacerbation of asthma. Interestingly, our data suggest a different way of regulation in contrast to GATA3 25. In virus infection, IL\u201013 released together with antiviral interferons may reduce the extent of inflammation and tissue injury, because IL\u201013 inhibits monocyte and macrophage production of proinflammatory factors 26. The data are scarce on the disconnection between GATA3 and IL\u201013 in viral infection, but specific viral infections may either decrease or increase GATA3\u2010mediated expression of Th2 cytokines 7, 27. Moreover, IFN\u2010\u03b2 may induce the expression of IL\u201013 receptor, leading to a consequential suppression of responsiveness to IL\u201013 28.",

In light of the recent demonstration of breaking allergen\u2010specific T\u2010cell tolerance in human tonsils by triggering of Toll\u2010like receptor (TLR) 4 or TLR8 and the proinflammatory cytokines IL\u20101\u03b2 or IL\u20106 29, we speculate that viral infections may have an important role in breaking peripheral tolerance and thereby promoting the development or exacerbation of allergic diseases. Rhinovirus is particularly interesting in this regard because it is the most important trigger of wheeze and asthma, especially in atopic individuals 5, 9, 30, 31. We demonstrate as a new finding that the intratonsillar virus, especially rhinovirus and parainfluenzavirus, detection was independently and positively associated with Th1 type expression. IFN\u2010\u03b3, which is mainly controlled by Tbet, has an important antiviral activity and capacity to downregulate Th2 type response 16, 25, 32, 33. The existence of virus infection and allergy increased the complexity of the gene networks, and interestingly, both disease conditions had similar polarizing influence on the overall gene\u2010to\u2010gene correlation profiles. A negative correlation between antiviral and regulatory genes, particularly IL\u201017, was observed only in the presence of a virus. IL\u201017 is a proinflammatory cytokine, and its downregulation most likely limits virus\u2010induced inflammation 25.
