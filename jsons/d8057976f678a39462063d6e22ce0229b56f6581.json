During Italian severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 outbreak, a woman presented with a rapidly progressive flaccid paralysis with unilateral facial neuropathy after a few days of mild respiratory symptoms. Coronavirus was detected by nasopharyngeal swab, but there was no evidence of its presence in her cerebrospinal fluid, which confirmed the typical albumin-cytological dissociation of GBS, along with consistent neurophysiological data. Despite immunoglobulin infusions and intensive supportive care, her clinical picture worsened simultaneously both from the respiratory and neurological point of view, as if reflecting different aspects of the same systemic inflammatory response. Similar early complications have already been observed in patients with para-infectious GBS related to Zika virus, but pathological mechanisms have yet to be established.",

Besides the demonstration of molecular mimicry between epitopes of C. jejuni and nerves, many microorganisms have been investigated in its pathogenesis, e.g., the recent reports of Zika virus (ZIKV)-related GBS [1] . During the current pandemic, one adult case of GBS has been associated with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [2] , but it is not clear if this strain of coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, SARS-CoV-2) might also have a potential for neurological complications rather than be coincidentally present in neurological patients.",

She also manifested a transient pruriginous dorsal rash but had no gastrointestinal symptoms nor relevant medical history, besides mild hypertension treated with beta-blockers. Lung CT scan showed bilateral groundglass opacities, but the first rhinopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 was negative; initial routine and gas analyses on blood were unremarkable (Table 1) . On evaluation, she was paraparetic with a rapidly progressive symmetric weakness in the lower limbs, leading to falls and paraplegia. She also had initial distal weakness in the upper limbs (MRC 4/5) Ottaviani Donatella and Boso Federica contributed equally to this work. and diffuse areflexia, but no clear sensory deficits. She underwent lumbar puncture with demonstration of a typical albumin-cytological dissociation (0 cells/uL, 108 mg/dL proteins), thus prompting initiation of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg, 0,4 g/kg for 5 days) on the presumptive diagnosis of GBS. Ten days after onset, a nerve conduction study disclosed absence of F-waves with diffuse prolonged distal motor latencies and reduced distal compound muscle action potential amplitudes with a slight reduction of conduction velocities, thus suggesting a mixed pattern of demyelination and axonal damage; no sensory nerve action potential was registered ( Table 2) . SARS-CoV-2 was not detected on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), while serology was not available at that time; anti-glycolipid antibodies were also absent.",

Other causes of concurrent neurotoxicities were also excluded, as hydroxichloroquine generally accounts for different side effects and antiretrovirals had yet to be administered when she started having neurological symptoms. Intensive supportive care and the need for strict isolation impaired clinical and instrumental assessment of the neurological aspect, despite being critical to determine prognosis. Remarkably, contrary to the previous reported case with COVID-19 [2] , our patient developed neurological deficits a week after the onset of respiratory symptoms and they progressed simultaneously; therefore, the evolution of her clinical picture does not support the typical post-infectious pattern of GBS and it could rather resemble a form of acute para-infectious paralysis that has already been associated with some viruses, such as ZIKV [3] . Indeed, this ZIK-V manifestation has peculiar characteristics that led to speculation about a possible different pathogenesis compared to classical GBS: (a) they seem to arise 5 to 10 days after infection and have higher morbidity, more frequent cranial neuropathies and concurrent immune-mediated disorders such as thrombocytopenic purpura [4] ; (b) anti-glycolipids antibodies typically involved in cross-reactive mechanisms are not common [5] ; (c) there is a predominant involvement of distal nerve segments [3] , where the blood-nerve barrier is lacking.",
