However, in blanket testing of an isolated village of approximately 3,000 people in northern Italy, 50%-75% of people with positive pharyngeal molecular tests were totally asymptomatic [1] . This finding was echoed by a more recent daily surveillance report from China, where all people arriving from overseas were rigorously tested [2] : among 166 persons with newly identified infections, 78% were asymptomatic. Although the infective dose associated with transmission is not known, the viral load in the respiratory tract in an asymptomatic patient has been reported to be similar to patients with symptoms [3] , and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection from an asymptomatic contact has also been described [4] .",

Airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was considered possible only when care procedures generating aerosols (e.g. intubation, bronchoscopy, and positive-pressure ventilation) are performed [6] . However, other studies seem to indicate the opposite, i.e., the virus can be present in exhaled air produced by talking and breathing [6] . Moreover, a potential role of aerosols in virus diffusion was evident in a complex laboratory study. Aerosols containing a viral load quite similar to that observed in human respiratory samples were created to generate an aerosolized environment. SARS-CoV-2 was detected up to 3 hours after the start of the study [7] .",

However, mask wearing by patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (an airborne infectious disease) has been shown to reduce infectivity to guinea pigs by 56% [9, 10] . The surgical mask has also been shown to intercept other human coronaviruses during coughing [11] . A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials also showed that surgical masks and N95 respirators were similarly effective in preventing influenza-like illness and laboratory-confirmed influenza among healthcare workers [12] . Similar results were obtained in a case-control study comparing the protective effect of surgical masks and N95 respirators against SARS among healthcare workers in five Hong Kong hospitals [13] .",

            "text": "Main studies on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission.246  patients were studied. Surgical face masks significantly reduced detection of influenza virus RNA in respiratory droplets and coronavirus RNA in aerosols, with a trend toward reduced detection of coronavirus RNA in respiratory droplets. The results indicate that surgical face masks could prevent transmission of human coronaviruses and influenza viruses from symptomatic individuals. The use of N95 respirators compared with surgical masks is not associated with a lower risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza. It suggests that N95 respirators should not be recommended for general public and non highrisk medical staff those are not in close contact with influenza patients or suspected patients. Seto WH. Lancet 2003;361:1519-1520. [13] Hong Kong Case-control study in 5 hospitals 241 non-infected and 13 infected staff were surveyed about use of mask, gloves, gowns, and hand-washing. 69 staff reporting use of all four measures were not infected, while all infected staff omitted at least one measure (p=0.0224). Fewer staff who wore masks (p=0.0001), gowns (p=0.006), and washed their hands (p=0.047) were infected compared with those who did not; stepwise logistic regression was significant only for masks (p=0.011). Practice of droplets precaution and contact precaution is adequate in significantly reducing the risk of infection after exposures to patients with SARS. The protective role of masks suggests that in hospitals, infection is transmitted by droplets.",
