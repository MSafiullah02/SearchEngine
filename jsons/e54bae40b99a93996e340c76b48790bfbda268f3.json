Locations such as Singapore and Taiwan have been successful in slowing epidemic growth by using intensive surveillance with broader testing strategies to identify and contain cases. 2, 3 In The Lancet Infectious Diseases, Sarah Ee Fang Yong and colleagues 4 report three clusters of COVID19 cases identified in Singapore in early 2020 by active casefinding and contact tracing and confirmed with RTPCR. One cluster from a church (Church A) was previously identified 5 and linked to two imported cases from Wuhan, China. The two additional clusters (Church B and a family gathering) were attributable to community transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV2) by one individual interacting with both clusters. Serological platforms were developed and assessed for confirmation of SARSCoV2specific antibody responses to capture past infections. By serological analysis, Yong and colleagues identified the missing link between the Church A cluster and the other two clusters-an individual who had twice tested negative by RTPCR. By linking all three clusters, Yong and colleagues highlight the success of such surveillance measures to capture many cases and effectively slow the spread of COVID19 in Singapore.",

Contact tracing, which is a necessary but insufficient means of disease control, needs careful effort and is sensitive to timing to be effective, particularly in highly dense populations. As shown in Singapore, serological analysis can be useful for contact tracing in urban environments and linking clusters of cases retrospectively to delineate transmission chains and ascertain how long transmission has been ongoing or to estimate the proportion of asymptomatic individuals in the population.",

            "text": "Beyond the immediate use of serological data to identify and contain cases, these data can also be used to set control policies. Population serological testing (specifically measuring SARSCoV2specific IgG antibody titres) can estimate the total number of infections by assessing the number of individuals who have mounted an immune response, regardless of whether an infection was subclinical or happened in the recent past (current data suggest antibodies persist for at least 4 weeks). 8 By providing estimates of who is and is not immune to SARSCoV2, serological data can be used in at least four ways. First, to estimate epidemiological variables, such as the attack rate or casefatality rate, which are necessary to assess how much community transmission has occurred and its burden. Second, to strategically deploy immune healthcare workers to reduce exposure of the virus to susceptible individuals. Third, to assess the effect of nonpharmaceutical interventions at the population level and inform policy changes to release such measures, Fourth, to identify individuals who mounted a strong immunological response to the virus and whose antibody isolates can be used to treat patients via plasma therapy. 9 Although the potential for serological assays to help control the COVID19 pandemic is substantial, the complexity of developing and validating a diagnostic test is not fully elucidated by Yong and colleagues. 4 Serological assays are currently being developed for widespread use. 10 Yet, several challenges remain: first, assessing the sensitivity and specificity of tests, particularly for determining disease during the acute phase of infection; second, verifying the test is not detecting crossreactivity with other viral pathogens that result in falsepositive results; third, understanding antibody kinetics over time to distinguish thresholds of immunity, because we do not know how long immunity to this novel coronavirus might last; and finally, ensuring the test is reliable for distribution and is costefficient. Although RTPCR diagnostics will still be",
