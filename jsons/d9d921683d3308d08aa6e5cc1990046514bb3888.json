            "text": "Calves with diarrhea often have small intestinal overgrowth with Escherichia coli bacteria, regardless of the inciting cause for the diarrhea, and 30% of systemically ill calves with diarrhea have bacteremia, predominantly because of E coli. Antimicrobial treatment of diarrheic calves should therefore be focused against E coli in the small intestine and blood, the 2 sites of infection. Fecal bacterial culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing is not recommended in calves with diarrhea because fecal bacterial populations do not accurately reflect small intestinal or blood bacterial populations and because the break points for susceptibility test results have not been validated. Antimicrobial efficacy is therefore best evaluated by the clinical response of a number of calves to treatment, with calves randomly assigned to treatment groups. Amoxicillin, chlortetracycline, neomycin, oxytetracycline, streptomycin, sulfachloropyridazine, sulfamethazine, and tetracycline administered PO are currently labeled in the United States for the treatment of calf diarrhea. On the basis of published evidence for the oral administration of these antimicrobial agents, only amoxicillin can be recommended for the treatment of diarrhea. Dosage recommendations are amoxicillin trihydrate (10 mg/kg PO q12h) or amoxicillin trihydrate-clavulanate potassium (12.5 mg combined drug/kg PO q12h) for at least 3 days; the latter constitutes extra-label drug use. Parenteral administration of broad-spectrum \u2424-lactam antimicrobials-ceftiofur (2.2 mg/kg IM or SC q12h) and amoxicillin or ampicillin (10 mg/kg IM q12h)-or potentiated sulfonamides (25 mg/kg IV or IM q24h) is recommended for treating calves with diarrhea and systemic illness; both constitute extra-label drug use. In calves with diarrhea and no systemic illness (normal appetite for milk, no fever), it is recommended that the health of the calf be monitored and that oral or parenteral antimicrobials not be administered.",

Although the administration of intravenous fluids and oral electrolyte solutions plays a central role in treatment, the efficacy of antimicrobial agents in treating calf diarrhea is controversial. The purpose of this article, therefore, is to critically review studies related to the use of antimicrobials in calves with diarrhea and to develop evidence-based recommendations for the use of antimicrobials to treat calf diarrhea. Treatment aspects related to economics, animal welfare, and the potential for promoting antimicrobial resistance are also important but are beyond the scope of this review.",

            "text": "There has been a paradigm shift in the last 40 years toward attributing an episode of calf diarrhea to a specific etiologic agent, such as rotavirus, coronavirus, cryptosporidia, Salmonella spp, or enterotoxigenic E coli. Although the etiologic approach has correctly focused attention on preventive programs, including vaccination and optimizing transfer of colostral immunity, it has diverted attention from the finding of numerous studies that calves with diarrhea have coliform bacterial overgrowth of the small intestine. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Studies completed more than 70 years ago documented increased numbers of E coli bacteria in the abomasum, duodenum, and jejunum of scouring calves. 3, 4 Moreover, calves severely affected with diarrhea had increased numbers of E coli bacteria in the anterior portion of their intestinal tracts, compared with mildly affected animals. 4 More recent studies have consistently documented that calves with naturally acquired diarrhea, regardless of age and etiologic cause for the diarrhea, have altered small intestinal bacterial flora. [5] [6] [7] Specifically, E coli bacterial numbers are increased 5-to 10,000-fold in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum of calves with naturally acquired diarrhea, 5-8 even when the diarrhea was not caused by enterotoxigenic strains of E coli and when rotavirus and coronavirus were identified in the feces. The largest increase in E coli bacterial numbers occurs in the distal jejunum and ileum, 5 whereas the E coli or coliform bacterial numbers in the colon and feces are similar or higher for calves with diarrhea than for calves without diarrhea, 5, 7 with E coli being more numerous in the feces of colostrum-deprived than colostrum-fed calves. 5 Small intestinal overgrowth with coliform bacteria can persist after departure of the initiating enteric pathogen. 7 In calves with naturally acquired diarrhea, increased small intestinal colonization with E coli has been associated with impaired glucose, xylose, and fat absorption. 7 Mixed infections with enteric pathogens are commonly diagnosed in calves with naturally acquired diarrhea, 6, 8, 9 and the clinical signs and pathologic damage associated with rotavirus infection are more severe when E coli is present than when it is absent. 8, [10] [11] [12] Primary viral morphologic damage to the small intestine also facilitates systemic invasion by normal intestinal flora, including E coli. 10 15 The figure indicates that the number of E coli in the large intestine of diarrheic and healthy calves is similar but that diarrheic calves have increased E coli numbers in their small intestine, particularly in the distal jejunum and ileum.",

Similar results have been observed in 2 recent North American studies. 15, 16 These studies identified bacteremia in calves with a median age of 8 days 15 or a mean age of 9 days 16 ; these results were at odds with current dogma that calf septicemia and bacteremia occur most frequently in the 1st few days of life.",

The only study to statistically test the predictive ability of fecal antimicrobial susceptibility results found that the rectal swab was an inaccurate method of predicting clinical outcome. 28 There do not appear to be any data demonstrating that fecal bacterial flora is representative of small intestinal bacterial flora, which is the physiologically important site of infection in calf diarrhea. Finally, and most importantly, the predominant strain of E coli in the feces of a scouring calf can change several times during the diarrhea episode, 5,29 and 9 of 20 (45%) calves with diarrhea had different strains of E coli isolated from the upper and lower small intestine, 5 indicating that fecal E coli strains are not always representative of small intestinal E coli strains.",

What is urgently needed are studies documenting the antimicrobial susceptibility of E coli isolates from the small intestine of untreated calves on the basis of achievable drug concentrations and dosage regimens.

Among surviving calves, the mean duration of diarrhea tended to be shorter in those treated with neomycin (6.5 days) or nifuraldezone (6.2 days) when compared with untreated control calves (9.7 days). Furazolidone (15 mg/kg PO q24h) also had no effect on mortality when compared with untreated control calves in a 1971 study completed in Scotland on 24 male Ayrshire calves with diarrhea. 36 One of the seminal studies was conducted on 165 beef calves with diarrhea in Saskatchewan, Canada. 37 Ampicillin (12 mg/kg PO q12h for 3-5 days) had no effect (P \u03ed .83) on mortality rate (26/83 \u03ed 31% in ampicillin-treated calves; 27/82 \u03ed 33% in control calves). Lack of treatment success in this 1975 study was later attributed to a delay in instituting antimicrobial treatment 38 ; antimicrobials were not administered until diarrhea had been present for a number of days. In the same year, a large study was conducted in Europe involving 347 male dairy calves with diarrhea. 39 Apramycin significantly decreased the mortality rate in calves treated at 20 mg/kg PO q24h for 5 days (mortality 10/118 \u03ed 9%, P \u03fd .001) or 40 mg/kg PO q24h (mortality 6/108 \u03ed 6%, P \u03fd .001) when compared with untreated controls (mortality 36/121 \u03ed 30%).

Ceftiofur is the most appropriate antimicrobial because it is a broad-spectrum \u2424-lactam antimicrobial that is resistant to the action of \u2424-lactamase; the MIC 90 for E coli is \u03fd0.25 g/mL 61 ; the recommended dosage schedule maintains free plasma \u2424lactam antimicrobial concentrations at the desired 4 times above the MIC 90 value for the duration of treatment in 7day-old calves; and 30% of the active metabolite of ceftiofur (desfuroylceftiofur) is excreted into the intestinal tract of cattle, 62 providing antimicrobial activity in both blood and small intestine. Moreover, ceftiofur hydrochloride (2 mg/kg IM once and 0.5 mg/kg PO once) decreased the mortality rate and the severity of diarrhea in pigs with experimentally induced enteric colibacillosis, although these pigs were not suspected to be bacteremic. 63 The beneficial effects of parenteral ceftiofur in these pigs was attributed to decreasing intestinal luminal concentration of pathogenic E coli. 63 Ceftiofur sodium (\u03fd5 mg/kg PO q24h) was also effective in treating mice with experimentally induced enteric colibacillosis. 61 Administration of ceftiofur to treat bacteremia and diarrhea in calves constitutes extra-label drug use, and ceftiofur should not be administered to calves to be processed as veal.",

Although parenteral ampicillin has proven efficacy in treating naturally acquired diarrhea, 38 whereas ceftiofur has unproven efficacy, the broad-spectrum \u2424-lactam antimicrobials amoxicillin and ampicillin are theoretically inferior to ceftiofur because parenterally administered ampicillin and amoxicillin reach lower plasma concentrations, require a higher MIC than ceftiofur, and are not \u2424lactamase resistant. 61 Amoxicillin or ampicillin should be injected into the neck musculature because this site provides the greatest absorption 62 and minimizes damage to more valuable areas of the carcass. Amoxicillin and ampicillin should not be administered subcutaneously because the rate and extent of absorption is reduced relative to intramuscular injection. 64 A 3rd recommended treatment is parenteral potentiated sulfonamides (20 mg/kg sulfadiazine with 5 mg/kg trimethoprim IV or IM, depending on the formulation characteristics, q24h for 5 days). Efficacy of potentiated sulfonamides has only been proven when treatment began before clinical signs of diarrhea were present. 43, 44 It is therefore unknown whether potentiated sulfonamides are efficacious when administered to calves with diarrhea and depression, although it is likely that potentiated sulfonamides are efficacious in the treatment of salmonellosis.",
