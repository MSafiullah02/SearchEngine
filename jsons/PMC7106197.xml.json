Therefore, the knowledge, clinical, procedural, and team skills necessary to efficiently and effectively run a pediatric resuscitation are not frequently practiced, making simulation the ideal environment to further hone these skills in order to be prepared for the real event.4, 5, 6 The American Heart Association has advocated for the increased use of simulation as part of advanced life support training, including Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS). The addition of simulation to advanced life support curriculum has been shown to increase knowledge and skills in providers relative to those who did not receive simulation as part of their training.7, 8 Furthermore, high-fidelity resuscitation training has been shown to improve acquisition of clinical skills in comparison to training with low-fidelity manikins, thus supporting the American Heart Association's integration of simulation into these curriculum.9 A longitudinally distributed PALS course with a significant simulation component has also been developed to address the issue of knowledge decay seen in students following PALS courses.10, 11\n",

Based on this need, established programs like the American College of Surgeons' Advanced Trauma Life Support Course18 have increasingly used simulation as a means to practice the various clinical and procedural skills. More recently, courses like Trauma Resuscitation In Kids,19 developed by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada, have heavily leveraged the use of simulation in terms of the practical application of the concepts taught within the course. Trauma Resuscitation In Kids has also tried to maximize the use of interprofessional teams and a focus on team training in further driving the realism and pertinence of this experiential learning.",

The specific etiology of the MCI dictates the types and numbers of patients to be expected. There are several cognitive, emotional, and physical vulnerabilities that make the pediatric application of MCI training unique, including plans for patient reunification with family members.20, 21 Depending on the magnitude of the event, the goal of the PEM team changes to doing the most good for the most patients, within the limitation of available resources.22, 23 Because this affects the initial triage, stabilization and disposition of patients, simulated disaster codes can be an excellent way of practicing these specialized skills.24, 25, 26, 27, 28\n",

Similar to other clinical aspects of PEM, the transport of pediatric patients is a dynamic and complex problem that involves the interplay of an individual within a team working within a defined system and environment. The physical transport of patients most often occurs in an environment that is not ideal for the provision of pediatric emergency and critical care (eg, helicopter, ambulance, fixed-wing aircraft), but necessary based on the long distance required for the provision of definitive care. All of the elements of this dynamic environment can be simulated: tight spaces, noise, vibration, specialized equipment, and extreme conditions that impact the rapid evaluation and management of patients being transported. The physical ability to mimic these conditions has been aided by the portability of the new generation of wireless portable mannequins.",

Four main curricula have been developed to date. The most robust of the group was developed using a Delphi reduction method that resulted in 48 key curriculum topics to be covered during a 2-year PEM fellowship, averaging out to 2 per month.29 A second PEM fellowship curriculum was created by identifying key topic areas and then choosing key presentations within each of those topic areas. This curriculum was designed to run on a weekly basis while PEM fellows rotate through the ED. The topic areas are divided into first- and second-year and the scenarios chosen from a total of 43.3 A longitudinal curriculum designed to teach PEM content to pediatric residents used content mapping targeting various core resuscitation skills (eg, airway and breathing, circulation, teamwork, etc) divided among multiple scenarios.30 Finally, a longitudinal curriculum designed to teach PEM content to emergency medicine residents resulted in a curriculum of scenarios designed to parallel the systematic approach to airway, breathing, circulation, disability and exposure/environment that is taught in the PALS course. The curriculum consisted of 6 formative cases and 3 evaluation cases performed at a later date. There was a correlation found between performance and year of training, but no direct improvement as a result of the educational intervention.31\n",

They are often delivered at the beginning of a training program to rapidly develop the key knowledge and skills required to function well within the discipline. Other boot camps have been developed to help with the transition between years in training (ie, from year 1 to year 2 of PEM fellowship training). Some programs have even used this learning modality to link up with other programs and maximize time, space, equipment, and human resources (ie, facilitators). A combination of procedural skills, clinical skills, and team training (crisis resource management) are often covered. Their popularity stems in part due the practicality of scheduling; some programs can cover new fellows or interns for a day or two of dedicated training vs routine longitudinal attendance at a weekly simulation event. Depending on the scale of boot camps, the availability of a large simulation center may be required to handle the number of leaners in the time allotted both with space and simulation equipment.",

The primary objective of JIT is to choose the patient or procedure ahead of time and to rehearse performance prior to managing the patient or performing the procedure in real life. Although the prediction of clinical presentations to the ED is impossible, certain thematic topics can be predicted in a JIT fashion: assessment of a polytrauma patient, approach to a poisoned patient, mass-casualty incident, cardiac arrest, and so on. This is an obvious difference with JIT sessions traditionally seen in intensive care units and inpatient units, where a specific patient is chosen based on the potential for deterioration. As opposed to scenario-based clinical presentations for knowledge and team training, JIT in the ED is well suited to procedural skill training. There have been several successful examples of this published in the literature related to lumber puncture, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (chest compressions), and airway management.34, 35\n",

This distress is further compounded by the uncertainty of how the family will respond given that PEM providers usually do not have long-term relationships with patients and families. Appropriate preparation and education can make difficult conversations less stressful for the PEM physician, and in cases of death notification, it may help decrease the development of pathologic grief in the surviving family members that can occur when death is unexpected. There are a few different models for delivering bad news suggested in the literature, including GRIEV_ING and SPIKES.44, 45 Regardless of which model is selected for education, the objectives can be achieved through the use of role play, simulation, and standardized patient encounters that focus on this complex skill.

Simulation can be provided in these settings in a variety of ways. Distance education using screen-based simulation offers the opportunity to enhance cognitive skills relative to PEM clinical presentations, yet requiring minimal resources compared with the use of high-technology manikins. However, screen-based simulation is not suited to address procedural skills, team-based training, or systems issues inherent in PEM clinical practice. There is still a need to provide in situ experiential learning using mobile simulation programs, where simulation equipment and educators are transported to participants in these environments.

In our busy clinical setting, the EMR introduces substantive human factors concerns such as loss of eye contact/attention of the provider at the computer, the need for a (additional) provider working at the EMR, who is perhaps outside the room leading to opportunities for error. While some centers can either simulate or provide this feature, this ability currently comes with both a time and monetary cost to maintain. The absence of EMR interaction creates the potential for negative learning as team leaders/members may forget, for example, to close the loop regarding order placement when the EMR is omitted. Further, EMRs can be part of important system barriers that may go unrecognized without their inclusion during simulation. Our local experience with ordering emergent blood products has illustrated how challenging this can be and forms an important take home for learners (ie, to learn how to order blood before the crisis). Further work needs to identify methods to allow use of existing EMR systems in simulation. At the same time, hospitals should be encouraged to invest in workable test systems that can be used for more than the mundane technical testing needs. At the same time, commercial or open-source simulated EMRs could be used to help address this need in part.",
