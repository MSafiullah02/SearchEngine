            "text": "Since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, infrared thermography (IRT) systems have been used as border-control devices at most major international airports to screen passengers for fever. IRT remains the gold standard for border control, because it can rapidly mass-screen infected individuals without contact.1, 2, 3, 4 However, IRT measurements are influenced by several factors, including the environmental temperature and humidity, alcohol consumption, and the consumption of antipyretic medications.5 Body temperature, in particular, can be modified rapidly by the consumption of antipyretic drugs, which directly affects the sensitivity of IRT. Hence, fever-based screening using IRT suffers from low sensitivity. This paper describes a combined visible and thermal image processing approach that uses a complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) camera-equipped IRT system that may address this issue. These systems have already been installed at most major international airports, and they can remotely sense several vital signs, including body temperature and heart and respiration rates, thereby facilitating the rapid and accurate screening of people who are suspected of carrying infectious diseases.",

Inflammation causes elevations in body temperature and in heart and respiration rates; therefore, integrating vital sign monitoring increases screening accuracy. This concept was used in previous studies by the present author group to develop a novel infection screening radar system to mass-screen individuals. This system utilizes a multisensor fusion technique to remotely measure heart and respiration rates using a microwave radar, and the facial skin temperature is measured using IRT. The results from case\u2013control studies that investigated seasonal influenza screening showed a detection accuracy that ranged from 81.5% to 98.0% using the heart and respiration rates and the facial skin temperature, which is higher than the detection accuracies of the conventional fever-based screening methods.6, 7, 8, 9\n",

Consequently, the system is not used widely. Hence, to promote the widespread use of vital-sign-based screening, focus has been placed on systems with minimum hardware requirements to achieve a system that is more suitable for real-world settings. The most reliable solution is to enhance the functionality of the conventional IRT systems that are already installed at international airports. By incorporating the latest advances in image processing techniques, these IRT systems can acquire thermal and visible images together by integrating visible and thermal cameras.",

Technical details of the system and the evaluation of its laboratory-based performance have been described in a previous publication.10 Respiration rates are measured by monitoring the temperature changes around the nasal area that are associated with inspiration and expiration; the facial skin temperature can be determined easily from the thermal images simultaneously. The circulation of blood in the face causes tiny color changes that provide a visible facial image that can be used to determine the heart rate.11 A multiple logistic regression function is incorporated into the system to predict the possibility of infection; hence, IRT can automatically detect infected individuals based on their vital signs, which are measured in real time. This system was tested on patients with an influenza-like illness in a clinical setting to evaluate the performance of this vital-sign-based screening approach using IRT alone.",

The circulation of blood in the face causes tiny color changes on facial images that are undetectable with the human eye. The CMOS camera uses this information to determine the heart rate. To measure the respiration rate from the thermal images, the temperature changes that occur around the nasal area during the inspiration of cold air from the environment and the expiration of warm air from the lungs was monitored, and the respiratory waveform was extracted from the differences in each of the thermal images. This enabled the respiration rate to be determined from the breath-to-breath intervals. The facial skin temperature was measured simultaneously using the thermal images. The image acquisition and processing programs were written in LabVIEW software (National Instruments, Texas, USA). Subjects were seated in front of the IRT system at a distance of approximately 0.5 m. The IRT system displays the \u2018Infection\u2019 or \u2018Healthy\u2019 result within 10 s using the logistic regression discriminant function, which bases the output on the heart rate, respiration rate, and facial skin temperature.",

The results of this study demonstrate that the effectiveness of IRT for the screening of infection can be greatly enhanced by measuring body temperature, as well as heart and respiration rates, using IRT without any additional sensors. The high level of accuracy of the automated IRT system has a number of clinical implications that could enable the system to be used to provide primary screening of people who may be carrying infections within emergency outpatient units or quarantine stations. Moreover, this system saves time, because considerable amounts of time are required to investigate false-positive subjects when systems have low sensitivity levels and NPVs.",

For example, the present study was conducted at the Takasaka Clinic in Fukushima prefecture, which is one of the three prefectures that were most affected by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan.14 The risk of contracting infectious diseases, particularly influenza, increased after the earthquake and tsunami in Fukushima, and healthcare professionals and medical facilities were severely affected by the disaster.15, 16 In such settings, an automated IRT system could distinguish between individuals who are and are not carrying infections, thereby alleviating the workload of healthcare professionals. Therefore, the proposed integrated visible and thermal image processing approach may be a promising pre-examination technique in disaster settings.",

However, the data samples are small for training in a logistic regression classification model. To refine the performance of the logistic regression classification model implemented in the IRT system, field testing with larger and completely random subject populations will be conducted in real-world settings. Moreover, to guarantee the accuracy of heart and respiration rate measurement by the IRT system, the authors are now working on the development of an automatic real-time human face tracking algorithm using visible and thermal images. Detecting and tracking human faces can significantly reduce motion artifacts, thereby extracting stable heartbeat and respiration signals. The face tracking algorithm can also be expanded to multi-person tracking, i.e., more than two human faces can be monitored simultaneously to avoid a \u2018human traffic jam\u2019 in places of mass gathering such as airports.",
