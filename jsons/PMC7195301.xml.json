On presentation, his temperature was 38.6\u00b0C. Laboratory tests showed a C-reactive protein concentration of 70.5 mg/L (normal range, 0.00-10.00 mg/L). Complete blood count showed elevated white blood cell count (14.9 \u00d7 109/L [normal range, 3.5-9.5 \u00d7 109/L]), neutrophils (14.2 \u00d7 109/L [1.8-6.3 \u00d7 109/L]), and monocytes (0.42 \u00d7 109/L [0.1-0.6 \u00d7 109/L]). D-dimer was 0.68 mg/L (0.00-0.5 mg/L) and platelet count was 163 \u00d7 109/L, whereas the lymphocyte count (0.25) decreased (normal range, 1.0-3.2 \u00d7 109/L). The computed tomography scan presented multiple ground-glass opacities with consolidation and bilateral lung involvement. The patient was diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the basis of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of sputum samples. The patient developed complications including septic shock, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, acute respiratory distress syndrome, thrombocytopenia, acute kidney injury, and catheter-related infections. The patient was treated with antibacterial, antiviral, and corticosteroid treatments, mechanical ventilation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.",

Although the precise mechanism of limb ischemic necrosis is unclear, this may be related to high-dose use of norepinephrine.1 Acute ischemic hepatitis (\u201cshock liver\u201d) has been identified as a potential risk factor for limb ischemic necrosis or symmetrical peripheral gangrene.2 The previous study shows that abnormal coagulation results, especially markedly elevated D-dimer and fibrin degradation product, are common in deaths with COVID-19.3 Therefore, the occurrence of limb ischemic necrosis in COVID-19 patients should be monitored closely.",
