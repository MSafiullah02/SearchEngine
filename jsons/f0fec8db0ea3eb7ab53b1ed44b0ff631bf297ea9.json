These diseases are grouped under the name porcine circovirus diseases (PCVDs). PCVDs include PCV2-systemic disease (PCV2-SD, formerly known as postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome, PMWS), porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS), PCV2 reproductive disease (PCV2-RD), PCV2-lung disease (PCV2-LD) and PCV2-enteric disease (PCV2-ED) (Segal\u00e9 s, 2012). Diarrhoea is a feature of some PCVDs and has been described in cases of PCV-SD and PCV-ED (Kim et al., 2004; Segal\u00e9 s et al., 2004; Opriessnig et al., 2007) . PCV2-SD occurs in pigs between one and six months of age with the highest number of cases occurring between two and three months (Segal\u00e9 s and Cortey, 2010). It is a multifactorial disease, in which infection by PCV2 is essential but other factors are usually required for its complete expression (Segal\u00e9 s et al., 2005; Madec et al., 2008) . From a clinical point of view, there may be a potential diagnostic overlapping between PCV2-SD and PCV2-ED since diarrhoea can be easily present in cases of the systemic disease (Opriessnig et al., 2007) . However, some authors have suggested that PCV2-ED could be a distinct clinical manifestation of PCV-2 (Kim et al., 2004) . To differentiate between these two conditions, histopathological findings and examination not only of gut but also lymphoid tissues is crucial. PCV-SD is diagnosed when the following are present: (a) clinical signs consisting of weight loss and paleness of skin (respiratory and/or digestive clinical signs may be present as well), (b) moderate to severe lymphocyte depletion with granulomatous inflammation of lymphoid tissues or other organs, and (c) moderate to high amount of PCV2 in damaged tissues. On the other hand, PCV-ED is diagnosed when (a) pigs suffer from diarrhoea; (b) a granulomatous enteritis and lymphocyte depletion is observed microscopically in Peyer's patches, but not in other lymphoid tissues, and (c) a moderate to high amount of PCV2 is detected in intestinal mucosa or Peyer's patches without detection in other lymphoid tissues (Segal\u00e9 s, 2012) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 52, "end": 75, "text": "(Segal\u00e9 s et al., 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 76, "end": 95, "text": "Madec et al., 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 552, "end": 570, "text": "(Kim et al., 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 571, "end": 593, "text": "Segal\u00e9 s et al., 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 594, "end": 618, "text": "Opriessnig et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 918, "end": 941, "text": "(Segal\u00e9 s et al., 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 942, "end": 961, "text": "Madec et al., 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1142, "end": 1167, "text": "(Opriessnig et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1272, "end": 1290, "text": "(Kim et al., 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 2150, "end": 2166, "text": "(Segal\u00e9 s, 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "From a case definition point of view, PCV2-ED and PCV2-LD share a common characteristic, which is the presence of lesions and PCV2 antigen/genome in intestines and lung, respectively, in absence of lesions and viral detection in systemic locations (Segal\u00e9 s, 2012).

Different agents have been involved, including infectious and non-infectious factors, in intestinal disorders in growing-fattening pigs (Thomson and Friendship, 2012) . Although bacteriological analyses were not performed in the studied cases, from a pathological point of view, intestinal lesions are usually related with specific infectious agents (Segal\u00e9 s and Mart\u00ednez, 2013). The most prevalent intestinal lesion was catarrhal inflammation of different parts of the intestine. CE is usually associated with colibacillosis, or less frequently with yersiniosis; on the other hand, CC is generally related with the infection of some species of Brachyspira. However, other noninfectious factors, such as the composition of diet, could also be involved. Another less prevalent lesion was FE/FC which is generally associated with Salmonella spp. infections. Other type of lesion, such as HE and UC or MHC, usually associated with clostridiasis or swine dysentery, appeared in a very small number of cases. Surprisingly, only four pigs had granulomatous enteritis (highly suggestive of PCV2 infection) compared to the high rate of detection of this virus in the intestine or other organs of these animals.

However, in the present study, most of pigs showing clinical intestinal disorders with PCV2 involvement were histopathologically diagnosed as PCV2-SD or suffered from subclinical systemic infection of the virus. Moreover, the scenario in which PCV2 was present in intestine but not in lymphoid tissues, as requested to diagnose PCV2-ED (Segal\u00e9 s, 2012), did not occur in any case; so that, PCV2-ED as specific clinicopathological entity was absent in the current study. These results coincide with those published by Tic\u00f3 et al. (2013) ; these authors studied the role of PCV2 associated lung disease (PCV2-LD) in cases of respiratory disease of nursery and growing-finishing pigs, but PCV2 infection exclusively restricted to the lung was not found in any case. All these results support the idea of PCV2 as a systemic pathogen, rather than virus able to cause a facultative local infection. Although, concomitant viral or bacterial agents could be present in the intestinal studied cases (worsening clinical signs), the amount of PCV2 detected in intestines was never higher than the one detected in lymphoid lesions of the same animal. Moreover, in those cases in which PCV2-ED was potentially suspected (not diagnosed as PCV2-SD), the viral load in intestinal and lymphoid tissues was lower than the amount of virus detected in PCV-SD cases.
