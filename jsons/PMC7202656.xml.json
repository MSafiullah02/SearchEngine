The present study included a total of 338 hospitalised patients with confirmed COVID\u201019; among them, 171 (50.6%) patients were males and 167 (49.4%) were females. The patients were classified into three groups: mild (64 cases, 18.9%), severe (199 cases, 58.9%) and critical (75 cases, 22.2%).

The percentage of males was higher than that of females in the severe and critical groups. Most of the patients had fever, cough, fatigue, expectoration and shortness of breath at illness onset. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (41.1%), diabetes (18.6%), cardiovascular diseases (5.3%) and malignancies (5%) (Table 1). We observed that the critical group had higher percentages of symptom manifestations and comorbidities. By March 10, 232 (68.6%) of the study patients had been discharged, 32 (9.5%) patients had deceased, and 74 (21.9%) were still stay in the hospital.

First, false\u2010negative and false\u2010positive results of antibody detection might affect the analysis among patients with different illness severities and disease courses. The results of this work need to be further validated by studies in a larger number of patients. Second, the time from symptom onset to admission may be long and the data of continuous monitoring in one patient were limited. Third, the relationship between antibody levels and viral copies within the same patients is unknown; this question needs to be studied further.",
