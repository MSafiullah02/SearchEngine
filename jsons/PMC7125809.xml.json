            "text": "Interferons (IFNs) are a family of multifunctional cytokines, which were originally described as antiviral cytokines, thereby protecting cells from viral infection (Isaacs and Lindenmann, 1957). However, based on the current knowledge they exhibit a broad spectrum of activities including anti\u2010proliferative, immunomodulatory, anti\u2010inflammatory, apoptosis\u2010inducing, stress\u2010mediated effects as well as regulation of cell differentiation steps and angiogenesis (Amadori, 2007, Baccala et al., 2005, Theofilopoulos et al., 2005). The IFN family is divided into type I, type II, and type III IFNs. Type I IFNs consist of 13 IFN\u2010\u03b1 members and single members of IFN\u2010\u03b2, IFN\u2010\u03ba, IFN\u2010\u03a9, and IFN\u2010\u03b5, respectively, which are all clustered on chromosome 9. In contrast, type II IFN is represented only by a single gene, IFN\u2010\u03b3, encoded by chromosome 12 (Decker et al., 2005). Recently, type III IFNs have been discovered as a novel class of antiviral cytokines which are classified into IFN\u2010\u03bb1, \u2010\u03bb2, and \u2010\u03bb3 (Oesterlund et al., 2007, Sheppard et al., 2003, Uze and Monneron, 2007). IFNs bind to two distinct cell surface receptors. Type I and II IFN signal through a common \u03b3\u2010chain, thereby activating discrete, but related pathways leading to the transcriptional activation of the so\u2010called interferon\u2010stimulated genes (ISGs) (Table I\n; Fig. 1\n). ISGs represent a functionally diverse group of genes involved in many cellular activities such as transcription, translation, regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis, intracellular communication as well as the processing and presentation of antigens. The transcriptional activity of ISGs is necessary to mediate the effect of IFNs.",

The IFN therapy has been shown to reduce the rates of relapses and mortality by between 12 and 30% in tumor patients (Kirkwood et al., 2004). However, during the last decade no further progress concerning the adjuvant therapy of tumor patients has been achieved. Therefore, a better knowledge of the underlying molecular mechanisms of IFN action may lead to improved and more effective applications and the design of innovative, intelligent treatment strategies using IFNs alone or in combination with other therapeutics.",

This triggers the activation of JAK1 and TYK2 leading to the phosphorylation of Tyr\u2010466 of the IFN\u2010\u03b1R1, which serves as a docking site for STAT2. The activated kinase subsequently phoshorylates STAT2 and STAT1 on Tyr\u2010690 and Tyr\u2010701, respectively. Both phosphorylated STATs form a heterodimer and associate with the interferon regulatory factor (IRF)9, which does not undergo tyrosine phosphorylation to form the IFN\u2010stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3), which, in turn, translocates to the nucleus and binds specific elements known as ISREs that are present in the promoters of certain ISGs initiating the transcription of a broad variety of genes. In addition, phosphorylated STAT1, other STAT complexes, and combinations of different STAT\u2010containing complexes can be formed which translocate to the nucleus and bind to the IFN\u2010\u03b3\u2010activated site (GAS) leading to the transcription of further genes (Caraglia et al., 2005). It is noteworthy that IFN\u2010\u03b1 can also activate STAT3 and STAT5, but the role of STAT5 in the IFN\u2010\u03b1\u2010mediated activity has still to be elucidated (Uddin et al., 2003). In contrast, IFN\u2010\u03b3 mainly activates STAT5b. However, one can speculate that a fine balance between different STAT complexes might account for specific responses and represent a key mechanism for IFN\u2010\u03b1\u2010induced activities.",

Binding of IFN\u2010\u03b3 initially leads to the formation of an IFN\u2010\u03b3R1 homodimer, which consecutively attracts the IFN\u2010\u03b3R2 chains. The IFN\u2010\u03b3R1 and \u2010R2 homodimer is constitutively associated with JAK1 and JAK2, which phosphorylate the tyrosine 440 at the intracellular domain of the IFN\u2010\u03b3R1 serving as a docking site for the latent cytosolic transcription factor STAT1. STAT1 is subsequently phosphorylated on tyrosine 701 and serine 727 leading to the homodimerization of phospho\u2010STAT1 molecules. These form a complex named the \u03b3\u2010activating factor (GAF) that translocates into the nucleus and upregulates the transcription of IFN\u2010\u03b3\u2010regulated genes including in particular the interferon\u2010regulated factors (IRF)1 and IRF7 which represent transcriptional activators, whereas the constitutively expressed IRF2 generally acts as a transcriptional repressor (Harada et al., 1989). IRF1 subsequently activates the transcription of caspase genes involved in apoptosis next to genes encoded in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in particular components of the MHC class I and class II antigen\u2010processing machinery (APM) as well as \u03b22\u2010microglobulin (\u03b22\u2010m) located on chromosome 15. The molecules of the antigen\u2010processing pathway are required for the initiation and triggering of proper CD4+or CD8+T\u2010cell responses, respectively. In addition, STAT1 and IRF1 cooperate with the ubiquitously expressed transactivating factor upstream stimulatory factor (USF)1 to activate the transcription of the class II transactivator protein promoter IV (CIITA\u2013PIV) that controls the expression of MHC class II molecules (Chen et al., 2007).",

            "text": "The generation and presentation of these antigens (Ag) requires a coordinated expression of several genes (Fig. 2A\n). Briefly, endogenously synthesized proteins are cleaved by the multicatalytic proteasome complex, in particular the IFN\u2010\u03b3\u2010regulated proteasome subunits, such as the low molecular weight proteins (LMP)2, LMP7, and LMP10. These peptides are further trimmed by cytosolic enzymes such as, for example, the tripeptidyl peptidase (TPP)II and the bleomycin hydrolase (BH) generating the correct N\u2010terminus (Kloetzel, 2004, Rock et al., 2004). Then the peptides are transported from the cytosol into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP), a heterodimer consisting of the TAP1 and TAP2 subunits. In the lumen of the ER the MHC class I assembly occurs, which is assisted by various chaperones such as calnexin, calreticulin, the oxido thiol reductase ERp57, and tapasin (tpn). Tpn facilitates the peptide loading onto MHC class I molecules. After successful peptide loading, MHC molecules are released from the peptide loading complex and the trimer consisting of MHC class I heavy chain (HC)/\u03b22\u2010m/peptide is then transported through the trans\u2010Golgi apparatus to the cell surface and presented to CD8+ CTL. Thus, proper expression of the major components of the complex MHC class I APM components is obligatory for effective T\u2010cell recognition of tumors (Groettrup et al., 1996, Jensen, 2007, Seliger et al., 2006).",

            "text": "Recently, it has been demonstrated that CD4+ T cells are also important for proper antitumor immune responses (Drozina et al., 2005, Jensen, 2007). These T cells recognize via their TCR antigens presented on MHC class II molecules. In contrast to MHC class I antigens which are expressed on all nucleated adult cells, the expression of the heterodimeric MHC class II molecules also representing transmembrane glycoproteins is highly restricted and preferentially found on the cell surface of professional antigen presenting cells (APCs). However, MHC class II antigen expression can be induced in other cell types by various cytokines, in particular IFN\u2010\u03b3. MHC class II expression is mainly controlled by the class II transactivator protein (CIITA), which acts as a master regulator for its coordinated constitutive and IFN\u2010\u03b3\u2010induced expression which also involves PKC delta (Kwon et al., 2007, Giroux et al., 2003). CIITA interacts with the transcription factors RFX, NFY, and CREB (van den Elsen et al., 2004), thereby forming an enhanceosome governing the MHC class II transcription. In addition, a coordinated expression of various MHC class II APM components exists. Mainly exogenous antigens are phagocytosed by APCs, directed then to lysosomes where they are cleaved into small peptide fragments (Fig. 2B). MHC class II antigens are assembled in the ER. The peptide\u2010binding groove of these molecules is initially occupied by the invariant chain which is degraded into the class II invariant chain peptide (CLIP) fragment by a series of key cleavage events, thereby protecting the MHC class II\u2010binding groove. The loading of MHC class II molecules with exogenously derived peptides is assisted by the chaperone\u2010like components HLA\u2010DM and \u2010DO, which results in an exchange of the CLIP fragment by these antigens. HLA\u2010DM is editing the peptides presented to CD4+T cells by catalyzing multiple rounds of peptide exchanges possibly favoring the most stable complexes. The peptide\u2010loaded MHC class II molecules are then transported to the cell surface and presented to CD4+T lymphocytes. In professional APC, exogenous antigens can gain access to the MHC class I pathway through distinct cross\u2010presentation mechanisms. Furthermore, the endosomal MHC class II loading pathway could also receive peptides derived from endogenous antigens through autophagy and other mechanisms (Dengjel et al., 2005, Schmid et al., 2007).",

Concerning the promoter of MHC class I APM components, some of them contain TATA and CAAT boxes, whereas others completely lack these regulatory domains in the promoters). In addition, it is noteworthy that both TAP1 and LMP2 are transcribed from a shared bidirectional promoter of only 596 base pairs (bp) separating their ATG translation initiation codon (Wright et al., 1995). The promoter of the major MHC class I APM components contain a combination of distinct transcription factor\u2010binding sites (TFBS), like Sp1, CREB, the nuclear factor (NF)\u2010\u03baB, E2F, and p300, but all exhibit IFN\u2010response elements, which hint toward their regulation by IRFs (Brucet et al., 2004, Chatterjee\u2010Kishore et al., 1998, Chatterjee\u2010Kishore et al., 2000; Fig. 3). In terms of the MHC class II pathway, the promoters of the invariant chain, HLA\u2010DM/\u2010DO and the MHC class II HC, respectively, contain similar, but also distinct transcription factor\u2010binding sites, whereas all of them contain an IFN\u2010response element in their promoter. An exception is represented by CIITA, which is regulated by multiple promoters differing in their TFBS composition. There exist three tissue\u2010specific promoters for CIITA, pI, pII, and pIII. One promoter controls the constitutive CIITA expression in dendritic cells (DC), whereas another is specific for the constitutive expression in B cells. The CIITA\u2013PIV regulates the induction of CIITA expression in different cell types. It contains several cis elements including a putative NF\u2010\u03baB site overlapping with an AP2 site, the IFN\u2010\u03b3 activating sequence (GAS), the E box, and an IRF element (Dong et al., 1999, Muhlethaler\u2010Mottet et al., 1998). Thus, the activity of the different MHC class I and II APM component promoters can be induced, but to a different extent, by type I and type II IFNs, respectively. IFN\u2010\u03b3 is a stronger inducer when compared to type I IFNs, whereas a combination of both substances exerts additive or even synergistic effects on MHC class I and II APM components. Activation of adaptive immune responses by IFN, in particular IFN\u2010\u03b3, is partially due to transcriptional activation of genes encoding the MHC class I and class II antigens and respective APM components such as the invariant chain, HLA\u2010DM/\u2010DO, CIITA, TAP, tpn, the LMPs, and ERAP1/2.",

An increasing proportion of tumors were found with total or selective HLA allelic losses supporting the theory that altered HLA expression phenotypes represent a major mechanism of tumor escape from T\u2010cell recognition due to downmodulation of presentation of immunodominant tumor antigens. Distinct HLA class I abnormalities, including total loss or downregulation of HLA class I antigens (Paschen et al., 2003), HLA haplotype loss (Ramal et al., 2000), HLA locus or allele loss (Jimenez et al., 2001) has been described in tumors originating from different tissues and multiple molecular mechanisms have been identified as responsible for these changes (Garrido and Algarra 2001). The mechanisms that underlie total or partial loss of HLA class I antigens (Table II\n) include mutations of the \u03b22\u2010microglobulin (\u03b22\u2010m) gene (Perez et al., 1999) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of MHC genes (Maleno et al., 2004). Other causes of total HLA class I downregulation comprise defects in the regulation of different components of the MHC class I antigen processing. Structural defects of APM components cannot be corrected by cytokine treatment; therefore, it does not restore HLA class I surface antigen expression. T\u2010cell\u2010based therapy may not be effective due to the irreversible loss of HLA class I molecules. This is important when selecting the appropriate immunotherapy for a given cancer patient.",

This phenotype allows the tumor cells to evade recognition by MHC class I\u2010restricted, tumor antigen (TA)\u2010specific CTL. Mutations in different APM components appear to be a rare event postulating that dysregulation rather than structural alterations is the major cause for aberrant APM component expression (Fernandez et al., 2000, Ramal et al., 2000, Seliger et al., 2006; Table II). This hypothesis is supported by experiments (i) identifying only few mutations in these molecules, (ii) characterizing the APM promoter activity in tumors, (iii) determining posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms, and (iv) treating tumor cells with IFNs to analyze whether deficiencies of APM component expression could be overcome by cytokines. Indeed, impaired APM component expression of tumor cells could be often restored by IFN\u2010\u03b1/\u03b2 and/or IFN\u2010\u03b3 treatment. The IFN\u2010mediated upregulation of APM components often results in enhanced MHC class I surface expression, which is required for the generation of an effective antitumor\u2010specific immune response. Indeed, the IFN\u2010induced upregulation of APM components improves antitumor\u2010specific CTL responses (Seliger et al., 1997, Tajima et al., 2004) and therefore represent a valuable strategy for the treatment of patients with APM component deficiencies. However, in some cases, tumors remain insensitive to IFN treatment despite the lack of structural alterations in APM components, rather suggesting an impaired IFN signal transduction.",

The impairment could occur at different steps along the IFN signal transduction pathways and might involve sequence abnormalities and/or different regulatory processes such as transcriptional, posttranscriptional, and epigenetic control (Fig. 1; Table III\n). The physiological relevance of the STAT/JAK and PI3K pathway has been established in mice with a targeted disruption of these genes. The lack of JAK1 activity was associated with a loss of IFN\u2010\u03b3 to induce growth arrest and apoptosis as well as an increased tumorgenicity (Sexl et al., 2003). However, the observed IFN\u2010\u03b3 response with respect to growth inhibition might also be attributable to the IFN\u2010\u03b3 inducibility of LMP2 (Hayashi et al., 2006). So far, there exists only limited information regarding the molecular mechanisms of IFN resistance in tumors (Huang et al., 2002, Lesinski et al., 2007, Wellbrock et al., 2005, Wong et al., 1997). Based on the current knowledge that STAT1 and IRF1 are involved in the transcriptional regulation of the dual TAP1 and LMP2 promoter, the loss of TAP1 and LMP2 expression may be attributable to deficiencies of these regulatory factors. Regarding the IFN\u2010\u03b1 resistance of RCC cell lines, it is associated with a defective induction of STAT1 that could be restored by the addition of a supernatant from PMA\u2010stimulated peripheral mononuclear cells (Brinckmann et al., 2002). This effect appears to be mediated by IFN\u2010\u03b3 although other cytokines might also be involved in this process.",

The absence of STAT1 phosphorylation was at least partially due to the constitutive expression of the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)\u20101 protein, which could be mediated by the JAK2 kinase inhibition via the SOCS phosphatase. SOCS\u20101 modulates the IFN\u2010\u03b3\u2010mediated signaling by binding to the autophosphorylation site of JAK2 and by targeting bound JAK2 to the proteasome for degradation (Waiboci et al., 2007). In addition, SOCS\u20101 expression correlates with melanoma progression and confers growth advantage (Komyod et al., 2007, Li et al., 2004). In another study, the IFN\u2010\u03b3 resistance was associated with SOCS3 expression. The resistant cell lines differed from the sensitive cells by a constitutive expression of SOCS3, by the absence or a low degree of SOCS1\u20133 activation following IFN\u2010\u03b3 treatment, and by a short duration of the cytokine activatory signal (Fojtova et al., 2007). The expression of IFN\u2010\u03b3\u2010responsive genes is also reduced in the choriocarcinoma cells JEG3 and JAR in comparison to the epithelial cell line Hela (Choi et al., 2007). This is mediated by a compromised tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT1 at tyrosine 701 and the reduced expression of IRF1. In addition, inhibition of the tyrosine phosphatases results in increased JAK1 and STAT1 phosphorylation and IFN\u2010\u03b3\u2010induced gene expression in these cells (Choi et al., 2007). The impaired expression of IRF1 and deficient phosphorylation of STAT1 were also observed in primary trophoblast cell lines suggesting that these defects are of clinical relevance.",

Indeed, methylation affects the binding of IRF1 leading to an abrogation of the IRF1 transactivation (Rodriguez et al., 2007b). Treatment with the demethylating agent 2\u20325\u2032\u2010deoxyazacytidine (DAC) restored the IRF1 expression and consecutively led to the reconstitution of the IFN\u2010\u03b3\u2010mediated MHC class I inducibility. Other studies have identified that the IFN unresponsiveness is attributed to low expression of STAT1 rather than to an absence of its phosphorylation (Abril et al., 1998, Xi et al., 2006). The absence of STAT1 expression has been correlated with the methylation of its promoter (Xi et al., 2006). Finally, there exists evidence that genetic instability in tumor cells may lead to modulation of the expression of the IFN\u2010\u03b3R, which in some cases has been reported to be associated with cancer prognosis. For instance, the loss of IFN\u2010\u03b3R independently predicts poor prognosis in ovarian cancer and may be responsible for the limited success in the outcome of treatment of ovarian cancer with IFN\u2010\u03b3 (Duncan et al., 2007).",

            "text": "The multiple activities of IFNs on tumor cells might coordinate the antitumor immune responses so that the early recognition and/or elimination of cancer cells by the innate immune system transitions to immune attack by the adaptive immune system (Dunn et al., 2006). The IFN\u2010\u03b3 on the tumor cell immunogenicity mediate the immune response directed against tumor cells through distinct mechanisms. IFN\u2010\u03b3 can downregulate the expression of the NKG2D ligands and at the same time increase the expression of MHC class I molecules (Bui et al., 2006). In vitro treatment with IFN\u2010\u03b3 decreased the death by NK cells independently from the expression of HLA class I molecules, whereas an increased MHC class I expression increased the sensibility CTL\u2010mediated lysis. Besides these in vitro results, there also exist information that abnormalities in the IFN signaling occurs in vivo. LMP2\u2013/\u2013 mice exhibit an impaired proteasome function and 36% of female LMP2\u2013/\u2013 mice develop uterine leiomyosarcomas by 12 months of age. Thus, the development of spontaneous human uterine leiomyosarcomas might be probably due to defects in early steps of the IFN signal cascade. Indeed, the defective TAP1 and LMP2 expression in these tumors is associated with a G871E mutation in the ATP\u2010binding region of the JAK1 kinase domain, thereby affecting JAK1 kinase activity, but neither JAK1 expression and production nor its degradation (Hayashi et al., 2006). This allows the tumor cells to evade antitumor\u2010specific immunity. In different tumor types, immunosuppression associated with STAT3 activation and STAT3\u2010mediated inhibition of DC function has been reported (Yu and Jove, 2004). The biological function of STAT1 and STAT3 differs in terms of cell growth and induction of an antitumor immune response. Whereas STAT1 abrogates growth and mediates antitumor effects, STAT3 promotes cell proliferation and tumorigenicity as it has been shown in melanoma and head neck squamous carcinoma. In both tumor entities, STAT3 expression is associated with tumor progression and mediates immune suppression. In addition, unphosphorylated or phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT3 are coordinately upregulated by both IFN\u2010\u03b1 and IFN\u2010\u03b3 and may represent a marker for the dynamic mechanism of melanoma progression and host response. Using methylcholanthrene (MCA) and untreated IFN\u2010\u03b3R\u2013/\u2013, a significant tumor development was observed in the IFN\u2010\u03b3R control mice. The crossing of IFN\u2010\u03b3R1 and STAT1\u2013/\u2013 mice with p53\u2013/\u2013 mice resulted in a spontaneous and more rapid tumor development in particular teratomas, hemangiomas, and chondrocytomas, whereas lymphoid tumors generally develop in IFN\u2010\u03b3\u2010sensitive p53\u2013/\u2013 mice. Interestingly, the IFN\u2010\u03b3\u2010sensitive tumor cells transfected with the dominant negative IFN\u2010\u03b3R mutant grew faster than untransfected tumors and were not rejected upon their treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) effectively eliminating control tumors (Marques et al., 2004). Furthermore, downregulation of the IFN\u2010\u03b3R in association with loss of Fas function is linked to tumor progression (Yang et al., 2008). Thus, the IFN\u2010\u03b3 responsiveness is an important mechanism in the control of tumor growth. An increased responsiveness to metastases\u2010promoting agents might be induced by many mediators in the microenvironment of melanoma including type I and type II IFNs. Both cytokines cooperate with TNF\u2010\u03b1, which involves a positive interplay between JAK1 and PKC signal transduction (Bianchini et al., 2006). These data suggest that multiple signals were generated by the host inflammatory cells, which are accompanied by cooperate with the invasive properties of tumor cells. Therefore, strategies targeting this cross\u2010talk among tumor and host cells in the microenvironment are needed to prevent tumor growth.",

This is associated with an enhanced transcription of CIITA and consequently with MHC class II expression of papillary thyroid carcinoma cells and explain the immune cell infiltration of RET/PTC\u2010positive cancers. Furthermore, a synergistic activity of TNF\u2010\u03b1 and IFN\u2010\u03b3 on CIITA was found in thyroid carcinoma (Rahat et al., 2001) The CIITA\u2010independent MHC class I expression could be upregulated by histone deacetylases like Trichostatin A (TSA) (Chou et al., 2005, Gialitakis et al., 2006). CIITA was refractory to IFN induction in many tumors. In colorectal and gastric carcinoma cells, CIITA is silenced by epigenetic mechanisms resulting in the lack of IFN\u2010\u03b3\u2010induced MHC class II expression (Satoh et al., 2004). In order to correlate the IFN unresponsiveness with the expression profile of ISGs, cDNA microarray analyses were employed using a customized microarray consisting of 850 ISG (Holko and Williams, 2006). Expression of genes associated with transcription precedes the expression of genes involved in signal transduction, whereas no differences in the STAT1 induction were observed. However, subtle alterations in the expression profile might be responsible for the insensitivity to this cytokine. The maintenance of transcriptional activation following IFN treatment appeared to enhance IFN sensitivity.",

            "text": "IFNs have been used in various clinical settings, since they are potent negative regulators of cell growth either by modulating the cell cycle or by inducing pro\u2010apoptotic genes. IFN\u2010\u03b1 has been extensively studied in the treatment of various malignancies during the last two decades demonstrating improved clinical outcome of hematological malignancies (chronic myeloid leukemia, cutaneous T\u2010cell lymphoma, hairy\u2010cell leukemia, multiple myeloma), solid tumors including malignant melanoma, renal\u2010cell carcinoma (RCC), AIDS\u2010related Kaposi's sarcoma, and viral syndromes (hepatitis C, hepatitis B, severe acute respiratory syndrome). IFN\u2010\u03b3 has shown positive results in the treatment of chronic granulomatous disease, multiple sclerosis, and severe malignant osteopetrosis (Parmar and Platanias, 2003, for review). However, the resistance to IFNs has been described, which limits their anticancer activity. The impaired expression of IFN\u2010responsive genes might have important implications not only in immunotherapy but also in transplantation, pregnancy, and the development of tumors such as choriocarcinoma. Despite proven clinical efficacy in malignancies, viral infections, and multiple sclerosis, a substantial number of patients fail to develop positive clinical response to IFN therapy. Although IFN\u2010\u03b12b is a clinically active therapeutic agent for malignant melanoma and RCC, only 15\u201320% patients with metastatic melanoma respond to IFN therapy (Marincola et al., 1995). Other reviews report even lower response rates of only 6% of treated melanoma patients (Quesada et al., 1985, Umeda and Niijima, 1986). In RCC, the best results of IFN treatment as determined by the response rate and the duration of the effect were obtained in patients with a previous nephrectomy without chemotherapy, in a good functional state, and with preferentially lung metastasis. In these patients the survival rate increased from 49 to 115 weeks upon IFN\u2010\u03b1 administration (Logothetis, 1992). Despite these positive results, there exist many aspects of these response factors which are not well understood. Actually, none of these factors has been proved to be associated in an unambiguous way with the cytokine response and the patients' survival. The key aspect may be the right selection of patients, since currently all of them independent of previous nephrectomy and the presence of metastasis are enrolled into the treatment with poor clinical outcome. Unlike type I IFNs, IFN\u2010\u03b3 has not been approved for cancer treatment by the FDA. IFN\u2010\u03b3 produces numerous antitumor effects and plays a central role in promoting natural immune responses directed against developing tumors. However, its practical application in immunotherapeutic protocols has been very limited. In clinical trials, an improved survival was observed in patients with ovarian cancer of stage Ic\u2013IIIc treated with IFN\u2010\u03b3 (Windbichler et al., 2000), when IFN was intravesically administered to patients with transitional\u2010cell bladder carcinoma (Giannopoulos et al., 2003) or when IFN was used in isolated\u2010limb perfusion of individuals with non\u2010melanoma cancers of the extremities (Lienard et al., 1998). However, no effect was detected upon IFN\u2010\u03b3 treatment of patients with metastatic RCC (Gleave et al., 1998), advanced colon cancer (Wiesenfeld et al., 1995), or small\u2010cell lung cancer (Jett et al., 1994). The limited success of the therapeutic use of IFN\u2010\u03b3 might reflect the inability to target IFNs in the right place with an efficient concentration (Dunn et al., 2006). Despite the proven pivotal role of endogenously produced antitumor immunity of IFN\u2010\u03b3 in animal models, the limited success of this cytokine in cancer immunotherapy trials in humans might be explained by the resistance of tumor cells to IFN\u2010\u03b3 (Kaplan et al., 1998, Rodriguez et al., 2007a, Wong et al., 1997). In this context, it is important to note that unlike type I IFNs, IFN\u2010\u03b3 has a direct effect on tumor cells during the antitumor immune response supporting the relevance of IFN\u2010\u03b3 in the cancer immunoediting process (Dunn et al., 2004). The targets of the immunologic unresponsiveness represent genes encoding components of the MHC APM components or the constituents of the IFN\u2010\u03b3R signaling pathway. In this context, in two recent studies from our laboratory, the physiological relevance of HLA class I surface expression during the tumor rejection process in patients receiving different protocols of immunotherapy was assessed (Cabrera et al., 2007; Carretero et al., submitted). In the first study, a significant difference in the immunotherapeutic response of patients exhibiting metastases with low levels of MHC class I surface antigens and those with high levels of MHC class I expression was detected. In a second trial, the impact of cytokine unresponsiveness was demonstrated by determination of HLA class I antigen expression levels on metastatic melanoma lesions during the course of the disease in one patient undergoing IFN\u2010\u03b1 2b and autologous vaccination plus BCG (M\u2010VAX). BCG triggers the IL\u201012/IFN\u2010\u03b3 axis and induces upregulation of genes associated with antigen presentation (Feinberg et al., 2004, Saban et al., 2007). The level of the MHC class I antigen expression was dependent on the IFN response since neither of the progressor metastases increased the expression of HLA class I antigens after vaccination. However, a significant increase in the HLA class I surface expression was detected in the regressor metastases. Therefore, the HLA class I surface antigen on tumor cells significantly contributed to the therapeutic effect of BCG. In connection with these findings, downregulation of HLA class I surface antigens in cancer cells has been considered a significant risk factor for recurrence in patients with intravesical BCG immunotherapy for bladder cancer (Kitamura et al., 2006).",

The balance of STAT phosphorylation versus SOCS expression might be crucial in the activation of immunologic response through APM and MHC class I transactivation (Wang et al., 2007). For instance, the effects of high\u2010dose IFN are associated with immunologic processes such as an upregulation of TAP1, TAP2, tpn, and LMP2. The STAT1 and STAT2 pathways in melanoma cells are sensitized to IFN\u2010\u03b1 by pretreatment of the cells with IFN\u2010\u03b3. Thus, the biological response to IFN\u2010\u03b1 might be mediated by a direct effect on melanoma cells and suggests also a potential role for IFN\u2010\u03b3 in the treatment of this disease (Carson, 1998). In addition, it has recently been demonstrated that IFN\u2010\u03b1 treatment of patients with cutaneous melanoma significantly modulates the balance of STAT1/STAT3 in tumor cells and host lymphocytes. This results in an upregulation of TAP2 and an increased immune response (Wang et al., 2007).",

The application of the molecular analysis of tumor tissues has now advanced to the point where better classification schemes and prognostic variables are used leading to an optimization of specific treatment programs and patients' selection. The identification of tumor lesions with the capacity to upregulate MHC gene expression will determine the ability to present new antigenic peptides to T lymphocytes favoring regression of primary or metastatic tumor lesions. In contrast, the identification of tumors with MHC irreversible genetic lesions will maintain an unaltered MHC expression, thereby not exposing new antigenic peptides to T cells, which subsequently favors tumor and/or metastases progression. We propose that suppression of IFN signaling in tumors contributes to tolerance by inhibiting expression of genes encoding subunits of HLA class I/II antigens and/or components of the MHC class I/II APM that could be detrimental to successful antitumor responses.",

The type I and type II receptors are transmembrane glycoproteins whose extracellular domains serve as IFN\u2010binding sites, whereas their cytoplasmic domains associate with members of the JAK kinase family and initiate signal transmission (Dunn et al., 2006). Upon binding to their specific receptors both type I and type II IFNs induce a number of signal transduction cascades, which involve the phosphorylation of various components such as TYK2, JAKs, and STATs. After recruitment to the receptor, STATs become phosphorylated, form homo\u2010 or heterodimers, and migrate to the nucleus to bind to specific sequences in the promoter of target genes. Type I IFN\u2010induced signaling then induces homodimerization of STAT1 and heterodimerization of STAT1 and STAT2. STAT1 and STAT2 associate with the cytosolic transcription factor IFN\u2010regulatory factor 9 (IRF9), forming a trimeric complex known as IFN\u2010stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) and activates transcription by binding to the ISREs. Type II IFN associates kinases, JAK1 and JAK 2 phosphorylate STAT1, which then forms homodimers, translocates to the nucleus, and activates transcription by binding to the GAS sequences. IFN\u2010mediated signaling is controlled by several mechanisms including dephosphorylation of IFN\u2010\u03b3R1, JAK1, and STAT1 (mediated by SH2\u2010domain\u2010containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2, SHP2), inhibition of the JAKs (mediated by suppressor of cytokine signaling 1, SOCS1), proteasomal degradation of the JAKs, and inhibition of STAT1 (mediated by protein inhibitor of activated STAT1, PIAS1).",

The MHC/\u03b22\u2010m dimer is incorporated into the peptide loading complex (PLC) in the ER. In the cytosol, endogenous peptides are generated by the proteasome, which were further trimmed by other peptidases and then transported into the ER via the heterodimeric TAP. ERAP is involved in the final aminoterminal trimming of peptides. The loading of MHC class I molecules with peptides is further assisted by the chaperone tapasin which is also a component of the PLC. Upon peptide loading, the PLC dissociates and then transported via the trans Golgi to the cell surface and there exposed to CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes. (B) MHC class II pathway. MHC class II molecules assemble in the ER with the invariant chain (li), which contains an endosomal targeting signal. This complex is then transported to the endosomal compartment and there the Ii is cleaved by a number of proteases leaving only the CLIP fragment, which occupies the peptide\u2010binding groove. HLA\u2010DM and \u2010DO catalyze the release of CLIP, which is exchanged by antigenic peptides. HLA\u2010DM edit the repertoire of the MHC class II\u2010peptide complexes, which are then transported to the cell surface for recognition by CD4+ T lymphocytes.
