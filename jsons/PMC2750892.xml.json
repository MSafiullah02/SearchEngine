            "text": "Membrane fusion is a fundamental biological process that occurs in intracellular trafficking, exocytosis, resealing of plasma membranes, protein trafficking, and in the entry of enveloped viruses. This ubiquitous process is mediated and tightly controlled by a combination of specific protein machinery and lipid composition.1 Lipids spontaneously assemble into bilayer structures such as liposomes; however, lipid bilayer membranes do not spontaneously fuse.2 The spontaneous negative or positive curvature of a lipid can enhance or diminish fusion, respectively, but energy must be expended to overcome hydration repulsion between membranes and to disrupt the bilayer structure. The energy for this remodeling may be derived from the thermal fluctuations of the membrane or from specialized fusion proteins.2 Many biological processes, such as neuronal synaptic vesicle fusion, endosomal fusion, and exocytosis, employ the SNARE superfamily proteins.3 SNAREs are found in all eukaryotic organisms. All SNARE proteins have a common heptad repeat that forms four-helix coiled-coil structures, and this coiled-coil SNARE complex forms in trans to promote fusion of the two membranes in which the SNARE proteins are anchored.4 Enveloped viruses use an analogous strategy and mediate fusion with target cells through specialized fusion proteins. The paramyxovirus parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5) requires two surface glycoproteins for this process: the attachment protein hemagglutinin neuraminidase (HN) that binds sialic acid and the fusion protein (F) that physically merges the two membranes. Paramyxovirus fusion occurs at the plasma membrane and does not require the low pH of the endosome to trigger fusion.5\n",

Recently, the crystal structures of both the uncleaved prefusion conformation of the paramyxovirus F protein and the uncleaved postfusion conformation were solved.6, 7 The prefusion form contains a globular head containing three domains (DI\u2013DIII) attached to a trimeric coiled-coil stalk formed by the HRB region. The HRA region in the prefusion form is composed of 11 distinct segments that wrap around the DIII core in the globular head.7 This is in contrast to the postfusion form of F where HRA is extended into a long \u03b1-helix as part of the six-helix bundle (6-HB). For the postfusion structure, an unanticipated finding emerged as the available data indicate the F TM domain and/or cytoplasmic tail are important for the folding of F into the metastable prefusion form of F:6 secreted F lacking a TM domain converts to the postfusion form.",

            "text": "Upon receptor binding, biochemical studies indicate HN induces a conformational change in F and the HRB three-helix stalk separates.8 It is hypothesized that following the melting of the HRB helices and destabilization of the head (Fig. 1b), HRA refolds to form an extended \u03b1-helical coiled coil, which enables the insertion of the fusion peptide into the target cell membrane and forms the prehairpin intermediate7 (Fig. 1c). The F protein then refolds where HRB binds into the grooves between the HRA monomers and forms the six-helix bundle (6-HB), bringing the FP and TM domain into juxtaposition within the same membrane7, 9, 10, 11 (Fig. 1e). A conceptually related final postfusion structure is formed for all enveloped virus fusion proteins. The postfusion structure consists of either an \u03b1-helical coiled-coil structure like the 6-HB in PIV5 F or \u03b2-strand structures in other fusion proteins, such as dengue virus E, Semliki Forest virus E1, and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G.12 In all cases the fusion peptide and TM domain are together in the same membrane. The formation of the 6-HB and the associated free-energy change is tightly linked to the merger of the target and viral membranes.8, 13 The collapse of the prehairpin intermediate distorts the bilayers to possibly form an initial pointlike protrusion.14 Whether the insertion of the fusion peptide perturbs the lipid bilayer and lowers the distortion energy is unknown.14 Following the initial bilayer contact, membrane merger proceeds to the lipid stalk intermediate, where the outer leaflets of each bilayer merges but the inner leaflets remain separate. This stalk then expands to form the hemifusion diaphragm. Continuation of this expansion leads to formation of the fusion pore that allows for the transfer of aqueous contents (Fig. 1f\u2013i).15\n",

The N-terminus of the predicted TM helix is devoid of side chains such as Trp, Tyr, Arg, or Lys that typically anchor the end of the helix in the head-group region of the bilayer, and the side chains of the 15 preceding residues are uncharged and can partition easily between bilayer and aqueous phases.26, 27 This region forms the end of the coiled-coil HRB stalk and a short linker segment in the prefusion form of F. Finally, the C-terminal end of the TM helix is predicted to occur at the positively charged K510, but the seven residues following this residue are predominantly hydrophobic amino acids. Thus, if K510 snorkels into the head-group region, the TM helix might extend beyond this point. This finding is reminiscent of the TM helix of HIV gp41,23 which contains an absolutely conserved and functionally essential positively charged residue within the hydrophobic region of the TM helix. In summary, the TM helix of F appears to be longer than usual and has an unusually large number of potential orientations in membranes; these features piqued our interest and in part motivated the present study.",

            "text": "We first asked whether the TM domain formed a well-defined helical bundle in the prefusion form of the protein. This is a particularly important question, because TM helices of fusogenic proteins often have sequences known to mediate helix\u2013helix association, such as the GXXXG motif, and mutation of these sequences sometimes, but not always, leads to proteins that are properly expressed but have impaired function.20, 28, 29 Cryoelectron microscopy (cryoEM) studies on the human immunodeficiency virus fusion protein (Env) differ, as some reports indicate the TM domains of the fusion protein are apart, like the legs of a tripod,30, 31 whereas other studies indicate the TM domains are together and form one helical bundle.32 By singly substituting each residue of the TM domain with cysteines, we have examined the structure of the TM domain in the lipid membrane. The addition of an oxidative cross-linker and formation of disulfide bonds clearly showed that one face of the TM helix mediates the formation of a homomeric TM helical bundle, most likely a trimer. To address the role of specific residues within the TM helix we performed alanine-scanning mutagenesis, and determined that two residues, 486 and 488, are critical for PIV5 F fusion. The aggregate of analysis of the steps of fusion indicate these mutants do not support hemifusion and are trapped at the lipid stalk stage just prior to formation of the hemifusion diaphragm. Our results indicate a specific amino acid sequence of the TM domain is necessary for completion of fusion. The amino acid side chains at residues 486 and 488, which are predicted to be in the outer leaflet of the F TM domain, are critical for the merger of the two lipid membranes and fusion completion. The block in fusion observed with mutation of F residues 486 and 488 could be overcome by addition of compounds that affect the curvature of the membrane bilayer.",

It is also unknown if the TM domains of the PIV5 F monomers interact to form a trimer. It has been shown recently that TM peptides of influenza virus HA associate with each other in model membranes.33 In the prefusion form of F, HRB forms a three-helix bundle (3-HB) and HRB is separated from the TM domain by only seven residues. Therefore, it seems likely that the F TM domain monomers would be in close proximity in the membrane if not in a 3-HB. We used oxidative disulfide cross-linking to examine the structure of the F TM domain. This method has been used to investigate the arrangement of TM domains for several membrane proteins, such as the Escherichia coli chemoreceptor,34, 35, 36 the aspartate receptor,37 the influenza virus M2 ion channel,38 and CD39.39, 40\n",

In Fig. 3a are shown untreated F mutants analyzed under nonreducing conditions on a 3.5% SDS-PAGE gel. Disulfide bonds formed by air oxidation should occur only in the extracellular aqueous phase and the head-group region of the outer leaflet of the bilayer.38 Air oxidation is much slower in the hydrophobic region of the bilayer, and the reducing intracellular environment minimizes air oxidation on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Cysteine residues in the outer leaflet of the bilayer at positions 485, 486, 487, and 489 did form disulfide bonds, indicating the individual F TM domains are in close proximity to themselves and that these positions occur near the head-group region of the outer leaflet of the bilayer.",

Four residues (481\u2013484) can be deleted with full retention of function, while a two-residue deletion (483\u2013484) caused a decrease in fusogenic activity.10, 42 More strikingly, deletion of eight residues (477\u2013484), which compose the end of the coiled coil and the entire linker, leads to nearly full retention of fusogenic activity, while deletion of only six residues (479\u2013484) leads to a protein that is less well-expressed on the cell surface and highly inactive in fusion.10 Interestingly, if the HRB coiled coil continues into the TM region, the four-residue and eight-residue mutants would position the side chains of residues 485 and 486 in close proximity, consistent with their high level of cross-linking in Fig. 3a (see also Supplemental Fig. 2). On the other hand, there would be a strong mismatch between the axial rotation of the helical axes in the HRB coiled coil versus the TM bundle in the six-residue deletion mutant, explaining its lack of stability and function.",

Furthermore, the extent of cross-linking under these conditions is similar to that observed with previously characterized membrane proteins of known three-dimensional structure, suggesting that the TM domain folds into a well-defined structure.38, 43 One unusual feature, however, is that three consecutive residues near the outer leaflet of the bilayer (489\u2013491) form cross-links quite efficiently, suggesting some malleability in this region of the protein. To better determine the nature of the interface, the extent of disulfide cross-linking was quantified and fit to a sine wave. The raw CuP cross-linking data were normalized by dividing the amount of disulfide formed by the total amount of protein (disulfide linked plus not linked). The CuP data at 37 \u00b0C were used for most of the TM domain, positions 492\u2013509. Because cross-linking was stronger in the outer leaflet of the bilayer, low-temperature (4 \u00b0C) CuP data were used for residue positions 485\u2013491 so that data from the two regions would be on the same scale (and to maintain linearity of the image plate response to radioactivity). This type of approach was previously used to model the structure of the TM domain of the influenza virus M2 protein,38 where a similar level of cross-linking was observed.",

The effect of a pi bulge on the positioning of the residues that cross-link efficiently (when mutated to Cys) can be seen by comparing it to the result expected for an ideal helix and without a pi bulge (Fig. 3d). The pi bulge allows both the interfaces above and below the bulge to occur on the same face of the helix. A bundle was created from this helix by applying C3 symmetry followed by energy minimization (Fig. 3e).",

All these mutants were expressed at the cell surface at levels similar to that of wt F (Table 1). F TM domain mutants V485A, S487A, and I489A formed syncytia at levels similar to that of wt F, but F TM domain mutants L486A and I488A did not cause syncytia formation (Fig. 5a). These mutants also showed a substantial decrease in fusion in the luciferase reporter and dye transfer assays (Fig. 5b and c). In all cases where fusion occurred, both the lipidic dye, R18 (data not shown), and the aqueous content mixing dye, 6-carboxyfluorescein (6-CF), were transferred to the CV-1 cells, whereas F TM domain mutants L486A and I488A did not cause the transfer of R18 or 6-CF. Thus, these mutants do not cause either lipid mixing or content mixing. Previously, we determined that an increase in temperature can be a surrogate for HN triggering fusion.8, 53 To examine temperature-dependent triggering of the F TM domain mutants, red blood cells (RBCs) were labeled with 6-CF and bound to effector CV-1 cells expressing HN and F proteins and labeled with SYTO-17 at 4 \u00b0C. The target\u2013effector complexes were then incubated at 29, 37, or 42 \u00b0C for 15 min, and the number of fusion events was measured by confocal microscopy (Fig. 5c). For wt F, the number of dye transfer events increased with increasing temperature. The amount of fusion mediated by F TM domain mutants L486A and I488A increased between 29 and 37 \u00b0C, but increasing the temperature beyond 37 \u00b0C did not enhance fusion. The mutants L486A and I488A did not exhibit a hemifusion phenotype, i.e., transfer of the lipidic dye R18 to target cells in the absence of transfer of the aqueous dye 6-CF. It is possible that these mutations either stabilize the F protein and prevent F protein from attaining its lowest energy postfusion conformation or affect protein\u2013membrane interactions that stabilize an intermediate in the fusion pathway. For example these mutant F proteins may be trapped at a folding/fusion intermediate that cannot be overcome by an increase in temperature.",

The earliest stage of fusion that has been determined was inferred from functional properties of the N-1 peptide (which is derived from the HRA region of F). N-1 peptide can bind to the HRB region of F after HN has bound to target cells at 4 \u00b0C and inhibits fusion.8 Based on the atomic structure of prefusion F this step in fusion has been called the open-stalk conformation with the HRB helices melting and breaking the interactions at the base of the head but leaving the head domain largely intact.7 To determine if F TM domain mutants L486A and I488A can attain the F open-stalk conformation, a modified N-1 peptide, N-1-HAt, which contains an 11-residue HA tag (YPYDVPDYASL) at the C-terminus of N-1, was synthesized. Peptide binding was determined by the ability of the HA tag monoclonal antibody (mAb) to immunoprecipitate wt F protein. It was found that the N-1-HAt bound to F at 4 \u00b0C when target RBCs containing the HN receptor sialic acid were present but N-1-HAt did not bind to F as well in the absence of target RBCs. (Fig. 6a). To test if F TM domain mutants L486A and I488A reached the open-stalk stage of fusion, N-1-HAt peptide was incubated with cells expressing HN and one of the mutant F proteins at 4 \u00b0C in the presence of 0.5% hematocrit target RBCs (Fig. 6b). The HA tag mAb 12CA5 was used to immunoprecipitate the F protein containing bound peptide, and the total F in the lysate was immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal antibody (PAb) specific for F protein. N-1-HAt bound to wt F and F TM domain mutants L486A, and I488A, and the band for these mutants was generally more intense than that of the wt. This observation indicates the HRB region was accessible in all F proteins, and that the alanine substitutions in the TM domain might stabilize somewhat the formation of the open-stalk conformation of F protein.",

When the RBCs that have bound at 4 \u00b0C to the CV-1 cell are warmed to 37 \u00b0C, the majority of RBCs either fuse or are released due to the neuraminidase activity of HN that is active at 37 \u00b0C but not at 4 \u00b0C.8, 55 In the presence of C-1 peptide, the F protein forms the prehairpin intermediate and the RBCs remain bound to the CV-1 cells because the fusion peptide has inserted into the RBC membrane, but further refolding is blocked and fusion is inhibited.8 Addition of C-1 peptide did not affect the number of RBCs bound at 4 \u00b0C (Fig. 6c). However, when cells expressing F TM domain mutants L486A and I488A with bound RBCs were warmed to 37 \u00b0C in the absence of C-1 peptide, there was a near-complete loss of bound RBCs, suggesting that these mutants are not trapped at the prehairpin intermediate (Fig. 6c). To determine if these mutants reached the prehairpin intermediate or are unable to transition between the open-stalk conformation and the prehairpin intermediate, 40 \u03bcM C-1 peptide was added. At 37 \u00b0C there was an increase in the number of RBCs retained as compared to L486A and I488A at 37 \u00b0C without the addition of peptide, although the number was not as large as for wt F (Fig. 6c). These data indicate that the F TM domain mutants form the prehairpin intermediate, but the reproducible lower amount of C-1 binding for mutants L486A and I486A could indicate some impairment in prehairpin formation for these two mutants.",

S443P/L486A, S443P/I488A, G105A/L486A, and G105A/I488A were surface expressed similarly to wt F, whereas the surface expression of G109A, G109A/L486A, and G109A/I488A was only 10% of that of wt F (Table 1). Expression in BHK-21F cells showed that F mutants S443P/L486A, S443P/I488A, G109A/L486A, and G109A/I488A exhibited extensive syncytia formation (hyperfusogenic) and syncytia formation was independent of HN expression (data not shown). F G105A/L486A and F G105A/I488A showed higher levels of syncytia formation than F L486A and F I488A but less than that of F G109A protein, consistent with earlier data for F mutant G105A.59 Thus, whereas F TM mutants L486A and I488A cannot cause fusion, the addition of the hyperfusogenic mutants to create double mutants lowers the energy barrier to fusion and overcomes the block to fusion caused by the L486A and I488A mutations. These data indicate that the F TM domain mutations L486A and I488A have not caused the F proteins to convert to an inactive \u201cspent\u201d conformation and the F TM mutant proteins have not veered off the fusion pathway. It may be that increasing the number of active F molecules increases the probability of a successful fusion event\u2014perhaps the membrane state and the number of active F molecules are parameters that interact in a manner unknown to determine a successful outcome. Alternatively, the \u201clifetime\u201d of the prehairpin intermediate may be different between mutant and wt, and the presence of a greater number of active F molecules could enhance the probability of successful fusion. This second explanation is also consistent with the peptide pull-down results (Fig. 6).",

It is thought that formation of the F protein 6-HB brings the membranes of the virus and the target cell together8, 10 and exclusion of water molecules permits formation of the hemifusion stalk. This stalk is an initial lipid connection between the proximal membrane leaflets.60 The stalk then expands to form the hemifusion diaphragm, which is a single bilayer segment, before the fusion pore forms.60 Lipids can affect membrane fusion based on their molecular shape. The cone-shaped lipid stearoyl lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) has a positive spontaneous curvature, which is predicted to hinder the transition to hemifusion when present in the outer bilayer. The cone-shaped lipid oleic acid (OA) has a negative spontaneous curvature, which favors hemifusion when present in the outer bilayer.61 The addition of LPC and OA to cells expressing HN and F proteins has been shown previously to inhibit and favor an increase in fusion, respectively.8 To examine whether addition of cone-shaped lipids would overcome the block in fusion of F TM domain mutants, LPC was added to CV-1 cells expressing HN and wt F, F L486A, or F I488A before and during binding of R18- and 6-CF-labeled RBCs at 4 \u00b0C. On warming to 37 \u00b0C, neither lipid mixing (R18 transfer) nor cytoplasmic content mixing (6-CF transfer) occurred between the RBCs and the CV-1 effector cells (Fig. 8a). In contrast, addition of OA to the effector cells not only increased wt F fusion, but also caused a significant increase in lipid and content fusion for F TM mutants L486A and I488A (Fig. 8a). Chlorpromazine (CPZ), a drug that causes positive curvature of the lipid bilayer, ruptures the hemifusion diaphragm and causes pore formation.61 The addition of CPZ to effector cells did not cause an increase in lipid or contents fusion for F TM domain mutants L486A or I488A (Fig. 8b). Thus, these data suggest that the block in fusion of F TM domain mutants L486A and I488A occurs during the lipid intermediate stages of fusion. It is not known at which stage of the lipid intermediates the F protein attains its final postfusion form, although it is usually considered that refolding of the prehairpin intermediate to the postfusion form occurs across the stages of the lipid intermediates. The augmenting of fusion by OA that confers negative curvature to the membrane suggests that the F TM domain mutants are delayed/arrested at the lipid stalk intermediate and do not reach the hemifusion diaphragm or fusion pore stages of fusion.",

L486 and I488 were each substituted with I/L, V, F, C, A, G, T, W, or Y (Fig. 9\n). I, L, V, and F are residues that prefer to be buried deep in a bilayer, experiencing a favorable free energy of transfer from water to the bilayer center. By contrast, C, A, G, and T, show relatively flat potential profiles, indicating that transfer to the bilayer is neither strongly favored nor disfavored. Finally, W and Y have a strong tendency to localize in the head-group region of the bilayer, relative to either the bilayer center or the aqueous phase. The fusion activity of each of the mutants expressed in Vero cells was determined using a luciferase gene reporter assay. Fusion activity was severely decreased (less than 50% of wt F) for residue 486 or 488 substitutions A, G, T, W, and Y.

The results are plotted for the average, and for segments with scores plus or minus a single standard deviation from the mean. In each case the sequences funnel down to a relatively sharp minimum. Because each point reflects the score for a 20-residue sequence, the minimum identifies the 20-residue segment with the highest propensity to lie vertical to the bilayer surface. This figure also compares the profiles of the F protein with that for the other two integral membrane proteins of the PIV5 (SH and HN)66, 67 and the M2 proton channel of influenza A virus,68 the latter of which contains both a TM helix as well as a C-terminal cytoplasmic helical segment (Fig. 9c). The sequences of SH, HN, and M2 funnel in the usual manner, and 20\u201330 residue stretches are observed with a high propensity to span the bilayer. Interestingly, however, the F protein sequence shows an unusually broad minimum, indicative of a much more extended sequence with some propensity to lie within the bilayer. This property is conserved among the paramyxovirus F proteins tested (measles virus, mumps virus, Newcastle disease virus and human parainfluenza viruses 2 and 3), although the profile for PIV5 is the broadest (Supplemental Fig. 3). For PIV5 F, the absolute minimum in the curve suggests the TM helix begins at residue 485, in good agreement with the air-oxidation cross-linking data, showing this to be near the head-group region. However, with a very small energetic cost, the native TM helical bundle could translocate up or down through the membrane or lie at an oblique angle.",

Figure 9d illustrates the effects of the mutations on the cumulative E(z) potential score for the N-terminal region for the mutations at residues 486 and 488. To help visualize the effects, the graphs were computed for double mutants, but the same trends hold for the individual mutants. The mutations change the 20-residue window of the protein with the most membrane-favorable sequence. Instead of the 20-residue window 485\u2013504 being the most membrane favorable, the best window becomes 493\u2013512. Additionally, with the exception of Trp, all the mutations have the effect of moving the most membrane suitable 20-residue window from 485\u2013504 in the wild type to 493\u2013512 in the mutants. Clearly, other regions of the protein are important for determining the boundary of the TM helix so it is difficult to interpret this as a literal movement of the TM in the resting state. Nevertheless, if helical movements are important for the fusion mechanism, these changes would upset the energetics of fusion. Figure 9e shows an atomistic model of the proposed extended TM domain region of PIV5 F. The canonical TM is shown in green, while the N-terminal (blue) and C-terminal (red) regions that are more suitable for the membrane than one standard deviation above the mean are also shown. The extended TM domain region is expected to be more suitable for the membrane than any window in 24 of the 153 TM domain sequences.26\n",

The F protein TM domain was found to exhibit sequence dependence for fusion activity and it was also observed that a block of 20 leucine residues could not substitute for the entire PIV5 F TM domain even to obtain cell surface expression of F. Upon further substitution, residues L486 and I488 were found to play a key role in fusion, where altering the hydrophobicity of the side chain at these residues profoundly affected fusion activity (Fig. 9a). Although F mutants L486A and I488A were deficient for fusion, biological activity could be rescued by the addition of the destabilizing mutations F S443P, F G105A, or F G109A (Fig. 7), indicating F L486A and I488A were not trapped in an intermediate conformation nor had the mutant F proteins veered irreversibly off the fusion pathway. It is generally thought that F-mediated membrane fusion requires the action of several trimers and the hyperfusion phenotype of destabilizing mutants may be due to more synchronous F-activation events in an otherwise stochastic process. Thus, addition of a destabilizing mutation to F proteins that are blocked for fusion may simply alter the lifetimes of conformational intermediates, driving the fusion process by mass action. Detailed analysis indicated F L486A and F I488A form the prefusion conformation of F, the open-stalk intermediate, the prehairpin intermediate, and F can be converted to a conformation that is close to, or at the postfusion form (Fig. 1a\u2013e). As discussed above, the precise timing of the conversion of the prehairpin conformation to the postfusion form with the formation of the lipid intermediates is not known, but refolding of F may occur across all the lipid intermediate stages. Evidence from studies of HIV gp120/gp41 suggest some 6-HB formation occurs after a pore has formed.13, 73\n",

The available atomic structures of ion channel proteins indicate that the multiple TM domains are mostly \u03b1-helical69 and for the very few known viral proteins, the structures of the TM domains of integral membrane proteins are \u03b1-helical.71, 72, 75 Even less is known as to whether the TM \u03b1-helices are together in the membrane forming helical bundles or whether each \u03b1-helix is separate from the others. Clearly, for the influenza virus M2 ion channel, the TM domains form a four-helix bundle.71, 72 CryoEM studies on the human immunodeficiency virus fusion protein (Env) differ, as some reports indicate the TM domains of the fusion protein are apart, like the legs of a tripod,30, 31 whereas other studies indicate the TM domains are together and form one helical bundle.32 The substitution of F TM domain residues with cysteine and cross-linking induced by air oxidation confirmed the N-terminal boundary of the TM in the membrane, and treatment with CuP indicates the TM domains in the F trimer form a TM helical bundle. Further, the extensive cross-linking of residues in the outer leaflet of the bilayer suggests that in this region the helices have significant flexibility or are only partially folded, thereby allowing three consecutive residues to become very highly cross-linked (Fig. 3b). Quantification of the extent of disulfide bond formation and modeling studies indicate that the data fit best a model in which the F TM domain forms a 3-HB within the membrane. A break in the regular seven-residue period seen for coiled coils suggest that a residue was inserted near the center of the bilayer, resulting in either a pi bulge at residues 497\u2013500 (Fig. 3d and e) or a \u201cstutter\u201d geometry (Fig. 3f). The PIV5 TM domain contains glycine at residues 494 and 497, but they do not appear to be essential to function or to mediate tight interhelical interactions. Residue L486 is predicted to be at the interface of the 3-HB, although the fusion data (in the presence of oleic acid) indicate this residue is likely to interact with the lipids of the bilayer. Presumably, the structural malleability that enables the residues close to the ectodomain to form disulfide bonds also enables residue L486 to populate different conformations that either face the interior of the predicted 3-HB or interact with the lipid bilayer.",

The length would allow the helix to move dynamically into different orientations and/or lie at extreme angles in the membrane. In this work, the extraviral end of the TM helix in the resting state was inferred from the Cys cross-linking as well as the E(z) potential, which were in good agreement. However, if this were the only orientation sampled by the helix during fusion, then mutation of residue I488 to Trp should not negatively impact function because it would be on the exposed face of the 3-HB located in the head-group region, where Trp is quite stabilizing. If, however, dynamic changes in the orientation within the bilayer were required, then this anchoring substituent would upset the energetic balance between the states adopted along the reaction coordinate. Given that the mutants appear to be defective in lipid stalk formation, and that the TM helix has a hydrophobic region both preceding and following it, we consider it possible that the TM region might act as a template to stabilize the lipid stalk intermediate. The N-terminal hydrophobic extension would encourage the diffusion of lipids out of the outer leaflet of the bilayer and along the stalk-like template, and initiating the formation of the lipid stalk (Fig. 10\n). Decreasing the hydrophobicity of the protein by mutating I488 or L486 to less polar residues or stabilizing the initial configuration by inclusion of Trp and Tyr would increase the energetic cost of translocation of the helix through the membrane and migration of lipids up the stalk.",

Our calculations and experimental results suggest that the energy of the system is finely balanced, allowing this translocation to occur at minimal energetic cost. In the resting state, the TM bundle is stably inserted in the bilayer, but vertical translocations within the bilayer should occur at a relatively small energetic cost due to the lack of N-terminal anchoring residues and the hydrophobicity of the residues on both sides of the TM helix. More importantly, hairpin formation might provide a strong driving force for translocation of the TM helices in the bilayer. This conformational transition has the net effect of pulling the FP and the TM helix (located in opposing bilayers) toward one another, effectively applying a mechanical force favoring translocation of the N-terminus of the TM helix out of the bilayer, and the C-terminus of the TM helix deeper into the bilayer. The concomitant increase in length of the hydrophobic N-terminal extracellular region would provide a greater surface to serve as a template for nonbilayer lipidic intermediates. Finally, we note that in the prehairpin intermediate the 3-HB of HRA has a very hydrophobic surface prior to docking of the HRB helix and formation of the water-soluble postfusion 6-HB. Thus, the 3-HB of HRA could serve a similar role to encourage the initiation of a lipid-coated stalk projecting from the target cell's membrane.",

The process of converting prehairpin F to the postfusion form of F may provide the necessary energy to exclude the water between the membranes and form the lipid intermediates (Fig. 1c\u2013e). At the first stage of fusion, the outer leaflets of the two bilayers have just merged but have not mixed (hemifusion). The TM domain and FP may still be segregated in separate bilayers, and the interaction between the TM domain and FP could drive the formation of the hemifusion intermediate. Hyperfusogenic mutants G105A and G109A are located within the FP. These two mutants rescue fusion of L486A and I488A (Fig. 7). Although hypothesized previously that these destabilizing mutants G105A and G109A may cause hyperfusion by lowering the energy necessary to drive the various fusion intermediates,59 it is also possible that these FP mutants affect the potential interaction with the TM domain and destabilize and lower the energy requirement to mix the bilayers and drive the hemifusion intermediate and form the fusion pore (Fig. 1c\u2013e).",

            "text": "In summary, the results presented here demonstrate that the TM helix of F plays an active role in fusion. It forms a well-defined TM bundle, and subtle modulations to its sequence give rise to large changes in activity. We further suggest that its unusual sequence characteristics might allow it to play an active role in templating the formation of the lipid stalk intermediate. We note that other proteins such as HIV gp41 also show unusually long hydrophobic TM helices, and changing its physical properties strongly impacts fusion.23 Additionally, dengue E protein (a class II fusion protein) has two TM helices, one of which has a long membrane suitable region that has an E(z) score one deviation from the average of 153 TM domains (Supplemental Fig. 4a). VSV (class III) has a single TM helix that that also has a long membrane suitable region (Supplemental Fig. 4b). Although fusion is intrinsically a complex process with multiple transition states it would appear that viral fusogenic proteins share not only similar structures and conformational changes, but they might also specifically stabilize well-defined intermediates in the fusion pathway.",
