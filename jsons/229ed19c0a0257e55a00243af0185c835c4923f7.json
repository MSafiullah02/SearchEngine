Sia may be present in variant forms that include O-acetyl modifications at C4, C7, C8, and C9 positions, and N-acetyl or N-glycolyl at C5. They can also vary in their linkages, including \u03b12-3 or \u03b12-6-linkages. Here, we analyzed the distribution of modified Sia in cells and tissues of wild-type mice, or in mice lacking cytidine 5'-30 monophosphate-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase (CMAH) enzyme that synthesizes Nglycolyl modifications (Neu5Gc). We also examined the variation of Sia forms on erythrocytes and saliva from different animals. To determine the effect of Sia modifications on influenza A virus (IAV) infection, we tested for effects on hemagglutinin (HA) binding and neuraminidase (NA) cleavage. We confirmed that 9-O-acetyl, 7,9-O-acetyl, 4-O-acetyl, and Neu5Gc 35 modifications are widely but variably expressed in mouse tissues, with the highest levels detected in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. Secreted mucins in saliva and surface proteins of erythrocytes showed a great degree of variability in display of modified Sia between different species. IAV HA from different virus strains showed consistently reduced binding to both Neu5Gc and O-acetyl modified Sia; however, while IAV NA were inhibited by Neu5Gc and 40 O-acetyl modifications, there was significant variability between NA types. The modifications of Sia in mucus may therefore have potent effects on the functions of IAV, and may affect both pathogens and the normal flora of different mucosal sites. (241 words) IMPORTANCE 45 Sialic acids (Sia) are involved in many different cellular functions and are receptors for many pathogens. Sia come in many chemically modified forms but we lack a clear understanding of how they alter the interactions with microbes. Here we examine the expression of modified Sia in mouse tissues, on secreted mucus in saliva, and on erythrocytes, including those from IAV host species and animals used in IAV research. These Sia forms varied considerably between 50 3 different animals, and their inhibitory effects on IAV NA and HA activities and on bacterial sialidases (neuraminidases) suggest a host-variable protective role in secreted mucus.

Sia are key mediators of many normal cell and tissue functions through a wide variety of highly regulated cell-cell interactions during both development and 60 homeostatic processes, where they may be bound by cellular receptors and members of the selectin family (3, 4) . Their ubiquitous presence on cells, tissues, and mucosal surfaces also make Sia a key point of contact for commensal microbes and for invading pathogens including viruses, bacteria, and parasites (3, 5, 6).",

The addition of O-Ac to the C7 and/or C9 positions is mediated by the sialylate O-acetyltransferase enzyme, Cas1 domain containing 1 (CasD1), which has been suggested to add an O-acetyl group to the C7 position, from which it would migrate to the C8 and C9 position under physiological conditions, allowing the possibility 85 of the addition of another O-acetyl group to C7 (7, 13, 14) . The regulatory processes that control the number or positions of acetyl groups have not been well defined, although distinct differences in expression of 7,9-O-Ac and 9-O-Ac Sia have been reported in mouse and human tissues, chicken embryos, and in some other animals (7) . CasD1 uses acetyl-CoA to modify Sia in the activated CMP-Sia form before it is added to the glycan chain, and likely has a preference 90 for CMP-Neu5Ac as a substrate and is less active on CMP-Neu5Gc (14). The sialate Oacetylesterase (SIAE) enzyme can remove the 7,9-O-and 9-O-Ac modifications, although its activities and roles are not well understood (17) (18) (19) (20) . The 4-O-Ac Sia is produced in some tissues of many animals by a distinct sialate 4-O-acetyltransferase that is also likely expressed in the Golgi compartment; however, the gene for this enzyme has also not yet been identified 95 (21) (22) (23) . The 7, 8 , and/or 9-O-Ac Sia appear to be present at low levels -a few percent or less -in the cell-associated Sia on many cultured cells, but may be present at higher levels (10 to 50%) in Sia on the secreted mucus of various animals and on erythrocyte-associated glycans (15, 24) . However, the expression, distribution, and regulations of these modified Sia are not well 100 documented, nor do we understand their impact on pathogens, host homeostasis, and normal microbiota at different mucosal sites (9, 15, 16, 25) .",

The densely expressed Sia within various mucus layers on mucosal surfaces 105 also act to bind incoming pathogens and likely regulate both the release and transmission of 6 pathogens (26, 27) . Many pathogens therefore express proteins that attach to Sia, as well as expressing receptor-modifying enzymes such as sialidases (neuraminidases) that remove the Sia from the underlying glycan. Bacterial adhesins and toxins may recognize Sia on the surface of cells, and many bacteria can also use Sia as a metabolic carbon source after release through 110 the activity of neuraminidases, and uptake into the cell by Sia transporters (3, [28] [29] [30] [31] . These bacterial interactions with Sia are potentially affected by chemical modifications (30, 32) . Both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses may also bind Sia as primary receptors or co-receptors for cell recognition and infection, although only the enveloped viruses appear to express neuraminidases or sialate O-acetyl esterases, possibly to reduce aggregation of viral particles 115 during budding (5, 33) . For some viruses, Sia modifications are required for infection as viral proteins specifically bind to modified Sia -examples include human coronavirus OC43 and HKU1, and influenza C and D viruses, which all require 9-O-Ac Sia for cell infection (34, 35) .",

Influenza A viruses (IAV) use Sia as primary receptors for host recognition and cell entry through the activity of two surface glycoproteins that interact with Sia, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). HA is a trimeric protein that binds Sia to initiate the endocytic uptake of the virus by the cell, leading to fusion between the viral envelope and the endosomal membrane after exposure of the virus to low pH (36) . NA is a sialidase which 125 cleaves Sia from the mucus, cell surface, and from viral glycoproteins, allowing the virus to penetrate through mucus to the epithelial cells and reducing the aggregation of virions after budding from the surface of cells (37). Previous studies have suggested that 7,9-O-and 9-O-Ac Sia are expressed on cells or in tissues of many IAV host species and there is some evidence that these modifications may be inhibitory for NA activity and HA binding (38, 39) . However, the 130 specific effects of 7,9-O-and 9-O-Ac on the binding of Sia by HA or the cleavage of Sia by IAV NA have not been examined in detail, and it is unclear whether these changes influence infection efficiency or viral shedding. For example, modification of HA binding might influence the attachment of virus to cells or to mucus, while inhibition of NA cleavage of O-acetyl modified Sia may lead to virus being trapped in the mucus and cleared, reducing the efficiency of 135 infection.",

Neu5Gc is highly expressed in some tissues of IAV natural host species, including pigs 140 and horses, and is also present in the tissues of mice and guinea pigs, which are frequently used as animals models (9, 12, 41) .

We also test the effects of these modifications on HA binding and NA activity of different strains of IAV, as well as their potential to alter virus infection. (15, 16) . Mice are an important model species for biomedical research, and some tissues have previously been 155 screened for O-Ac display using probes derived from viral glycoproteins (virolectins) and by other methods (15, 16) . We examined the distribution of modified Sia in a variety of tissues of wild-type (WT) C57/BL6 mice. Both 9-O-and 7,9-O-Ac were found throughout the lung and trachea as well as in the tracheal sub-mucosal glands that produce most of the mucus ( Fig.   2A) . These modified Sia were also found throughout the GI tract, with staining associated with 160 epithelial cells, goblet cells, and associated mucus layers of the gastrointestinal tissues, including the stomach, small intestine, and colon (Fig. 2B) . Interestingly, 9-O-Ac appeared to be present in higher amounts in most tissues, including salivary gland and esophagus, while the 7,9-O-Ac staining was minimal. However, 7,9-O-Ac did stain stronger than 9-O-Ac in stomachassociated mucus, and on tracheal epithelial cells. This seems to indicate that while the same Table 1) , while, as expected, the CMAH -/mice showed only Neu5Ac in all tissues, similar to amounts reported previously for some of those tissues (44) (Supplemental Table 2 ). The lack of Neu5Gc in CMAH -/mice was also seen in GI tissues, indicating that Neu5Gc from dietary sources was not 180 detectably being taken up by these mice, as is seen in humans who eat a diet containing that Neu5Gc (46) . In the WT mice, tissues showed a great deal of variability in Neu5Gc expression.",

All O-acetyl Sia variants combined comprised between 2 and 16% of the Sia in most tissues, with the majority 185 being 9-O-Ac (1-9% of total Sia) ( Fig. 3B ; Supplemental Table 1 ). There was about 1.5 to 3 fold higher levels of O-acetyl Sia in most tissues of the CMAH knock-out mice ( Fig. 3C; Supplemental Table 2 ), as has been reported previously (44). The levels of 4-O-Ac Sia were generally low, making up ~2% of the Sia in small intestine (duodenum) and ~1% in spleen, testes, and esophagus. Mouse colon samples showed the highest levels of total O-acetylation, 190 with ~17% of Sia having one or more O-acetyl modification, again primarily 9-O-Ac. Given the patterns seen using the HE-Fc virolectin staining, the 7,9-O-and 9-O-Ac forms must be present at high levels within or on certain cell sub-populations, as well as within mucus or mucussecreting cells. For example, the high levels of 7,9-O-and 9-O-Ac found in the mouse colon were most likely associated with secreted mucus as most of those modified Sia were present in 195 goblet cells (Fig. 2B) . However, the differences seen between probe binding and the ratios of the different modified Sia within the total Sia underscore the importance of quantifying the different forms.",

Strong staining for 9-O-Ac in human respiratory tissues, and also within the submucosal glands of human respiratory tissue have also been reported, indicating that mucus from these glands could be enriched in O-acetylated Sia (47, 48) . To determine if human respiratory mucus was enriched in 7,9-O-and 9-O-Ac, secreted mucus from primary normal human bronchial 205 epithelial cells (NHBE) as well as conditioned media from human alveolar basal epithelial adenocarcinoma A549 cells, were analyzed by HPLC to determine Sia composition. We found that the secreted proteins in mucus from NHBE cells and A549 cells conditioned media contained primarily unmodified Neu5Ac with ~1-2% of 9-O-Ac and no detectable levels of 7,9-O-Ac (Table 1) .

While the proteins in saliva differ from those found in 215 respiratory mucus, they do contain some of the same heavily glycosylated proteins including mucins like MUC5B (49) (50) (51) . Human saliva was similar to the secreted mucus from NHBE and Erythrocytes (red blood cells, RBCs) express high levels of sialylated surface molecules, primarily on glycophorins, and are used in IAV research to study the interactions of HA binding specificity, determining viral titer through the hemagglutination assay, and inhibition of hemagglutination by antibodies (HAI assay) (52, 53). It has long been known that IAV varies in 230 hemagglutination of RBCs from different species, at least in part due to differences in the Sia linkages present. The structures of HAs with Sia bound often suggest that modification of the C4, 5, 7, and/or 9 positions would influence IAV interactions with Sia. We found that chicken and guinea pig RBCs, which are often used to titer IAV virus and as the standard substrate for HAI assays, contained almost exclusively unmodified Neu5Ac, as did those from humans and 235 dogs (Fig. 4C,D) . In contrast, pig, horse, cow, and sheep RBCs contain high proportions of Neu5Gc, along with varying amounts of O-acetyl modifications. The high levels of Neu5Gc Sia present on the RBCs of these species had been previously reported, although not directly quantified as presented here (24, 54) . The mouse erythrocytes tested here (from C57BL/6 mice) had the greatest diversity of modifications, with little Neu5Gc, around 50% Neu5Ac, and ~50% 240 of the Sia modified by 7, 8 and/or 9-O-acetylation, as previously reported (55) .

All NAs showed significantly lower levels of Neu5Gc Sia released from horse RBCs compared to the amounts of Neu5Ac released from chicken RBCs (Fig. 6B) .",

Again, variability was seen between NA VLPs here, with N7 having the 275 lowest activity against Neu5Gc compared to Neu5Ac and N9 having the most. There was also variability in cleavage activity between NA from different strains as well, as seen in the variable amount of Neu5Ac removed by the NA VLPs in Figure 6B , but it is unclear whether this difference is due to the intrinsic activates of the NAs when expressed as VLPs or to innate differences in the specific activities of each NA enzyme, or both. It is clear, however, that O- Aichi/1968 H3 HA-Fcs had decreased binding to Neu5Gc and Neu5Ac9NAc (Fig. 7A) . The addition of the N-acetyl group at C9 blocked most binding, while Neu5Gc showed only a low level of binding. We saw the same binding dynamics for other H1 and H3 HA-Fc, but the SNA lectin, which recognizes \u03b12-6-linked Sia, bound equally well to Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc, but not to Neu5Ac9NAc (Fig. 7B) . This shows that the presence of O-(and in this case N-) acetyl 300 modifications can inhibit many Sia-binding proteins. Sia in sera have long been known to bind to influenza viruses, so that sera are often treated with neuraminidase as a \"receptor destroying enzyme\" prior to use in serological tests (65, 66) . To specifically compare the effects of added Neu5Gc or Neu5Ac on the efficiency of 315 infection, the same three IAV strains were incubated with mouse serum from either wild-type mice (>80% Neu5Gc) or CMAH -/mice (100% Neu5Ac) prior to inoculation of cells (Fig. 8B) . In this case no specific trend was detected for the three viruses tested. Victoria H3N2 showed almost complete inhibition of infection by both sera, while PR8 H1N1 had a lower level of inhibition. Only pH1N1 showed a significant difference in response to the serums, with the WT 320 mouse serum having a much stronger inhibitory effect compared to the CMAH -/serum. This suggests that Neu5Gc vs. Neu5Ac inhibition may vary by virus strain, and that likely depends on some combination of HA binding specificity and NA activity.",

However, human saliva and secreted mucus from respiratory cells contained (59, 71) , and is seen in the balance between the activities of the HA and NA for the \u03b12-3 and \u03b12-6-linked Sia (71, 72) . Incubation of virus with the wild-type mouse serum 405 (>80% Neu5Gc) compared to the serum of CMAH -/mice (100% Neu5Ac) also showed varying effects. Inhibition by WT serum was seen only for pH1N1 virus, while Victoria H3N2 and PR8 H1N1 were inhibited by both sera. This could confirm previous findings that the density of Sia on these serum proteins is the strongest inhibitory factor rather than the type of modified Sia present, as shown for incubation with horse serum (73) . However, the variable results for Saliva from humans was collected by passive drooling following the protocol approved by the University at Buffalo Human Subjects IRB board (study # 030-505616). Informed consent was obtained from all human participants. Saliva from animals was collected by suction using commercially available devices containing absorbent sponges in a syringe-like receptacle 440 (Super-SAL and Micro-SAL, Oasis Diagnostics, Vancouver, WA). Saliva from mice (laboratory strain C57BL/10SnJ) was kindly provided by Jill Kramer (University at Buffalo) using a collection procedure as previously described (75) . Saliva from dogs, cows, horses, and pigs, was provided by Erin Daugherity and Luce E. Guanzini (Cornell University). Animals were not allowed to eat or drink prior to the collection to ensure the oral cavity was free of food and other debris. The 445 collection was performed using a commercially available device (Micro-SAL). Large animals were gently restrained and a larger collection device (Super-SAL) was placed under the tongue for up to three minutes, or until fully soaked. Saliva from castrated domestic pigs were also provided by Anja Globig (Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Insel Riems -Greifswald, Germany). Saliva from dogs was also kindly provided by Barbara McCabe (Buffalo, NY). Quantification of sialic acid by HPLC The sialic acid composition from tissues, mucin, and erythrocytes were analyzed by HPLC analysis as previously described (45, 76) . In brief, Sia from 20-30 mg of tissue, 50 \u00b5g of mucin or saliva, or 100 \u00b5l of washed 5% v/v erythrocytes were 475 release using 2M acetic acid at 80\u00b0C for 3 hr followed by filtration through a 10kD centrifugal filter (Microcon) and dried using a vacuum concentrator (SpeedVac). Released Sia were labeled with 1,2-diamino-4, 5-methylenedioxybenzene (DMB, Sigma Aldrich) for 2.5 hr at 50\u00b0C. HPLC analysis was performed using a Dionex UltiMate 3000 system with an Acclaim C18 column (ThermoFisher) under isocratic elution in 7% methanol, 7% acetonitrile, and 86% water. Sia ManNAc6NAc (62) as the donor precursor using a one-pot multienzyme sialylation system similar to that described previously (79) .",

While there have been suggestions that 9-O-Ac, 7,9-O-Ac, and Neu5Gc Sia might influence IAV infection by interfering with HA binding or NA activities, there is 330 not a lot of direct evidence for their effects. Here we re-examine and define the tissue-specific and mucus expression of the 9-O-and 7,9-O-Ac-Sia as well as Neu5Gc, and to directly test their effects on IAV HA binding, NA activity, and infection.Mouse tissue distribution. In previous studies we have shown that there is variation in the expression of the 9-O-, 7,9-O-and 4-O-Ac Sia (15). To better understand the type of 335 variation seen in other tissues, we examined the distribution of those forms, as well as Neu5Gc, in the different tissues of wildtype C57BL/6 mice, as well as those that are CMAH -/-. Using the HE-Fc virolectin probes, O-acetyl modified Sia were found only in specific tissues and on certain cell subpopulations. Higher staining was seen for cells and mucus in the respiratory and GI tracts, with trachea and colon having particularly strong staining for O-acetyl Sia on epithelial 340 15 cells and associated mucus layers. The percentages of O-acetyl modified Sia in the tissues of mice varied widely, with high levels of 7,9-O-Ac 2 and 9-O-Ac being found on erythrocytes (~47%) and the colon (~19%). The levels in most other tissues varied between 2 and 9%, although these would likely be associated with higher levels on the smaller subsets of cells that were positive for staining with the probes. Neu5Gc was also present in many wild-type mouse 345 tissues with expression varying widely (between 10 and 80%). This is consistent with staining for Neu5Gc previously reported in some mouse tissues (44). 4-O-Ac Sia was found in small quantities in only a few tissues, with the highest being found in small intestine (~2%). This is consistent with previous findings of 4-O-Ac levels in mouse brain and liver quantified by GC/MS, although gut associated levels of 4-O-Ac were much higher in that study, possibly due to 350 differences in tissue preparation (67). Considering the high level of apparent 4-O-Ac specific staining for the mucus in the colon, further investigation of this modification in mouse colonic mucin would be warranted. Variation in saliva and other mucins. To define the variation of modified Sia present in secreted mucus across different animals, we examined saliva as it contains many of the same 355 heavily glycosylated proteins and mucins, including MUC5B, that are present in respiratory mucus (49-51). We found a great deal of variability in both the amounts and types of modified Sia present. Some animals (horses, mice, and cows), had larger amounts of O-acetyl Sia in their saliva, while human and dogs had primarily unmodified Neu5Ac forms. Pigs are a natural IAV host, and their saliva contained primarily Neu5Gc, so that pig saliva might inhibit IAV 360 infection. Horses had around 10% 4-O-Ac Sia present in their saliva. The 4-O-Ac modificationhas been proposed to be a potent inhibitor of many types of viral and bacterial neuraminidases, and to be the \u03b3-inhibitor of horse serum, where it may be present at high levels on the \u03b1-2 macroglobulin protein(56,65,68).

This may be due to the particular functional characteristics of the microbiome in the GI tract compared to other mucosal sites, where 7,9-O-370 and 9-O-Ac on colonic mucus may decrease bacterial degradation of sialylated glycans, perhaps improving mucus integrity (69, 70). Microbiome interactions may also explain the increased O-acetyl modifications found on both cow and mouse saliva. Cows are ruminants and as part of their digestion, regurgitate partially digested food from their microbe-rich rumen into their mouth to continue chewing as a cud to extract more nutrients. Somewhat similarly, mice 375 are coprophagic and consume feces, along with associated microbes, to re-digest again to improve absorption of nutrients. This would give both cows and mice the potential for more complex mucus and microbe interactions in both the oral cavity and the gut, thus having Oacetyl modifications on sialylated glycans on saliva mucus proteins could be advantageous by preventing degradation. However, further research is needed on the roles of these modifications 380 for the interactions between oral and colonic mucus with the microbiome. Effects of modified Sia on influenza viruses. IAV use Sia as their primary receptor for host infection, and the specific linkages of Sia to the underlying glycan chain have long been known to influence host tropism (36). We examined the effects of O-acetyl and Neu5Gc modifications on IAV HA binding, NA cleavage, and on infection, and found differences among 385 the IAV strains examined. All the different IAV NA tested showed preferential removal of Neu5Ac over any modified Sia form. Cleavage by N1, N7, and N9 were strongly inhibited by mono-acetylated Sia, while N2 and N3 were less affected. All NA had much lower activity against Neu5Gc, di-acetylated Sia, and particularly against Neu5Gc forms with additional Oacetylations. This confirms previous reports showing or suggesting inhibition of NA cleavage in 390 H1N1 and H3N2 strains (38, 42), but revealing that there is wide variation of effects on different NA types. Acetylation and Neu5Gc modifications were also inhibitory for HA binding, with soluble HA-Fc sourced from different H1N1 and H3N2 IAV strains showing significantly lower binding to these forms compared to unmodified Neu5Ac in an ELLA assay. As IAV infects cells at mucosal surfaces in both avian and mammalian hosts, it is likely 395 that viruses interact directly with mucus both to initiate infection and during viral release. Using untreated or esterase treated BSM (to remove 7,9-O-and 9-O-Ac) it was seen that the unmodified Neu5Ac was most inhibitory, suggesting that O-acetyl Sia reduces HA binding to the mucin, allowing binding to the unmodified Sia on the cell surface. Esterase treatment, therefore, allows more efficient binding to the BSM and greater inhibition of IAV infection. For some 400 viruses there is likely a complementarity between the inhibitory effects of 7,9-O-and 9-O-Ac on HA and NA, where lower HA binding allows the viruses to avoid binding to Sia forms that NA cannot remove efficiently. This effect has been reported for virus grown in the presence of other NA inhibitors",

Some of these modifications inhibit HA binding and NA cleavage, but with a significant variability between IAV strains.
