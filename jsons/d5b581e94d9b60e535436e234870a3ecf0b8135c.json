Some behaviors, like toilet paper hoarding, would border on the comical if the situation were not so tragic. Others, like hand washing, social distancing and staying at home have real impact on viral spread and are crucial. As expected, many people from ordinary citizens to biomedical researchers are seeking remedies. However, the urgency of the search for new treatments during the current crisis has a dark side. That desperate people are at risk for fraudulent exploitation is well-recognized and, sadly, has been reported. Similarly, well-intentioned efforts may have adverse effects. In this context, chicken soup may offer some insights.",

More are likely being considered. Some experimental agents such as remdesivir have being requested for compassionate use [5] and others are being used used off label. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for certain COVID-19 patients [6] . Specifically, adolescent and adult patients who are hospitalized and unable to participate in a clinical trial may qualify for the EUA. This has been interpreted by some as 'FDA approval' for these medicines to treat COVID-19, which it is not. Nevertheless, in the charged atmosphere surrounding the pandemic, there has been a run on these medicines. Despite medical society and health agency recommendations, the general public, desperate for options, continues to put tremendous pressure for access to incompletely tested and potentially unsafe therapeutics. For many of these, the data supporting their safety and efficacy is similar to or less than that for chicken soup.",

With a fatality rate of 50% for patients admitted to the intensive care unit [7] , a medicine that reduced mortality to 25% would require 58 subjects to be treated with drug and 58 subjects with placebo in order to have an 80% chance of finding a statistically significant difference in death rates with a significance level of p<0.05. For a smaller, but likely important 20% relative reduction in mortality, 387 individuals would be required in each group. Alternate statistical approaches are possible, but the numbers required to have meaningful data are larger than possible at most individual centers. This means that clinical trials must be done in the context of collaborative groups. Happily, such groups have been rapidly organized [8] . In addition, plans are in place for data pooling with open access [9] . These efforts should help optimize learnings from the current crisis that will help going forward.",

It was easy for some, reassured by the belief that youth was protective, to forgo social distancing. Neither should homemade masks be an excuse for neglecting social distancing. Moral support to bolster the spirits of healthcare workers cannot derail the calls for proper equipment and support. Nevertheless, when added to all the other efforts required to address the COVID-19 crisis, the 'chicken soups' may have something to offer. 'Chicken soups', if they are appropriately used, should not preclude other important actions. Most importantly we must conduct the solid science necessary to address this crisis with a strong focus on the performance of rigorous randomized clinical trials.",
