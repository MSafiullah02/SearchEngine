The researchers sequenced the 29,903 nucleotides of the \u201cnew coronavirus\u201d isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from a 41-year old patient experiencing severe respiratory disease who had been admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan in late December. They also presented a phylogenetic analysis. The team performed metagenomic RNA sequencing with the Illumina Mini-Seq system, generating 56 million reads, and assembled nearly 400,000 contiguous segments with the software tool Megahit. By the time the paper was published, the genome sequence in GenBank had been posted and updated multiple times. To explore infectiousness, the scientists used the algorithm MUSCLE to compare amino acid sequences from the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of this virus\u2019s spike protein with those of different SARS coronaviruses (CoVs) and SARS-like CoVs. The similarities between the RBD-related amino acid sequences and predicted protein structures of the novel coronavirus and SARS-CoV indicate that the novel virus can invade a cell by using the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor as a kind of doorknob. Doing so, the authors note, \u201ccould potentially facilitate human-to-human transmission.\u201d",

            "text": "\u201cThis whole family of viruses makes use of these spikes, and each coronavirus has its own unique spike protein,\u201d says Daniel Wrapp, a member of the McLellan lab at UT Austin and co-first author of the Science paper4 on the cryo-EM structure of the viral spike. The more closely related two viruses are, such as SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the more similar their spikes. The team points out the spike is a key target for vaccines, therapeutic antibodies and diagnostics. Structural data will also help with evaluating ongoing spike mutations as the virus undergoes genetic drift. The University of Washington team notes the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein has a furin cleavage site between protein subunits, an aspect that makes this virus unlike SARS-CoV and other SARS-related CoVs. They also show ACE2 could mediate SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells. As Wrapp explains, \u201cwe were initially a little surprised to see the enhanced affinity between this new spike and ACE2, given its similarity to the SARS-CoV spike, but we think this may serve as one explanation as to why this virus spreads so much more easily.\u201d He says the UT team also noticed the furin cleavage site separating the receptor-binding subunits and the fusion subunits of the spike as soon as the genomic sequence of this novel virus was released, as have several other groups. In the paper3, the team notes the spike protein is a fusion protein with a pre-fusion conformation that \u201cundergoes a dramatic structural rearrangement\u201d to fuse with the membrane of the cell the virus is invading. Cryo-EM let the team to resolve different types of \u2018breathing\u2019 motions and conformational changes that might be lost when molecules are locked into a crystal lattice, says Wrapp. \u201cThe most dramatic movement that we observed in our dataset is the hinge-like motion of the receptor-binding domain, which is responsible for engaging ACE2 on the surface of cells.\u201d Several groups have hypothesized that this motion is an immune evasion strategy: the virus can mask parts that are susceptible to being neutralized, and, in the time gained, it binds to and infects a host cell.",

Glycans are another way viruses prevent antibody binding, says Wrapp. The immune system\u2019s antibodies are highly specific for protein motifs, but, for example, a small change can cause a sugar molecule to be attached to a part of the viral protein. This sugar-coating is often called a \u201cglycan shield,\u201d he says. The team generated over 3,200 micrograph movies, which led to a 3.5\u00c5-resolution structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein.

The University of Birmingham\u2019s Loman is a principal investigator in the ARTIC network, which stands for Advancing Real-Time Infection Control, in which collaborators from several universities in the United Kingdom, the United States and Belgium devoted to real-time molecular epidemiology for outbreak response have developed wet-lab and software protocols for characterizing SARS-COV-2 on nanopore sequencers in eight hours. It can be done more quickly if one is doing just a single sample, \u201cbut typically people multiplex, so a working day is about right,\u201d he says. Josh Quick, Loman\u2019s collaborator at the University of Birmingham, designed a tiling scheme to amplify the entire viral genome. Soon after the epidemic began, the team developed a multiplexed PCR primer set for whole-genome analysis of the virus. Kentaro Itokawa and colleagues at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases in Tokyo noticed, however, that the method led to low coverage of certain genomic locations5. This was because two particular primers could anneal to one another and form dimers, making them less efficient at amplification. The team in Japan developed replacement primers that the ARTIC team adopted. When primers form dimers, primers do not bind efficiently to the template, says Loman. \u201cWe are very grateful to Itokawa for finding the solution to this and have updated the scheme,\u201d he says. \u201cThe speed of open science here is wonderful to behold.\u201d",

But rather than finding ways to make his primers better, Altman says he found \u201cthe CDC primers had technical flaws in them that went against the conventional wisdom of how to design primers.\u201d Primer\u2013probe pairs N1 and N3 had reverse primers with high-temperature hairpin loops, he says. The N2 primer-probe set had a run of five \u2018C\u2019 bases in a row on the probe sequence. Primer3, an established software tool, \u201cflagged them as problems,\u201d he says. Hairpin loops can lead to inefficient amplification, which theoretically could lead to tests that provide various types of indeterminate results. He does not know if these caused the test\u2019s spurious results.

To find the minimum detection threshold, the team used serial dilutions of clinically positive samples with known concentrations and repeated the experiments at least 20 times. They evaluated the shelf life of the test reagents and overall test kit stability. For primer design, they selected specific genomic regions of the virus, designed primers and probes in silico, checked them for hairpin or dimer structures and adjusted the probes to avoid such issues, says Chen. As of early April, the company has manufactured and distributed 4.72 million tests to 70 countries and has completed 520,000 tests in its own labs.

At Zymo Research, applications specialist Luigi Basilio says he and his colleagues see the company culture rising to the challenge of a pandemic. \u201cRNA extraction is certainly something we never thought we\u2019d see trending in global news or on social media, but I think it\u2019s created a learning opportunity for people who aren\u2019t in the research space,\u201d he says. Perhaps this shows why RNA extraction, among other tools and techniques, is so important. \u201cAs critical as RNA extraction is, so are the scientists and researchers who perform them,\u201d he says. \u201cWho knows, maybe all of this will inspire young people to take interest and create a new generation of scientists.\u201d",
