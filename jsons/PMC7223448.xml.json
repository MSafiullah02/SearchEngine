However, the importance of rapid antibiotic administration must be balanced against the risks of unnecessary antibiotics, including antibiotic resistance and superinfections [11], particularly in the ICU [12]. Finding the right balance is challenging because VAP is difficult to diagnose. As there is no practical reference standard for VAP, perceived VAP rates and outcomes vary widely depending on the definition applied [13], and up to two-thirds of patients treated for VAP may not actually have VAP [14, 15]. Improved methods to diagnose VAP and inform the initiation of empiric antibiotics are urgently needed.",

These include fever, purulent secretions, hypoxemia, new or progressive chest radiographic infiltrate, elevated white blood cell count, and positive cultures of endotracheal aspirates (ETA) or bronchoscopic sampling techniques (bronchoalveolar lavage [BAL] and protected specimen brush [PSB]). Some of these have been combined into clinical models, the most popular of which is the Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS) [16]. However, despite widespread use of these signs and tests, their accuracy to diagnose VAP is poorly characterized [1, 17]. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate diagnostic performance (including sensitivity and specificity) of these signs and tests, compared with either histopathology of lung tissue, or quantitative BAL cultures as reference standards. We hypothesized that these individual tests, in isolation, had poor diagnostic accuracy for VAP.",

To pool the bivariate results, we applied the Hierarchical Summary ROC (HSROC) model [26], which appropriately incorporates both within-study and between-study variability by defining separate models for each type of variability. The within-study variation is described using a binomial distribution for the number of positive tests as a function of patients\u2019 true mortality status, while the between-study variation allows both the \u201cpositivity\u201d and \u201caccuracy\u201d parameters to vary between studies. We obtained summary point estimates of the pairs of sensitivity and specificity, positive and negative predictive values, as well as diagnostic odds ratios and likelihood ratios, along with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). Summary estimates of test accuracy were plotted in the ROC space together with the summary ROC curve. We conducted all analyses using the MetaDAS (version 1.3) [27] macro in SAS (SAS Institute), as recommended by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Review of Diagnostic Test Accuracy [20]. Univariate tests for heterogeneity in sensitivity and specificity are not recommended by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Diagnostic Test Accuracy, as they did not account for heterogeneity explained by phenomena referred to as the \"positive threshold effects\" [20]. Instead, it is preferable to demonstrate heterogeneity graphically through the scatterplot and the confidence region of the bivariate summary point within the ROC plane and the descriptive forest plots. For our primary analysis using histopathology as the reference standard, we conducted a predefined sensitivity analysis excluding studies that did not also use tissue culture for the diagnosis of VAP.",

Bayesian analysis demonstrates that the individual signs we evaluated do little to alter provider pre-test probability (Supplemental Tables 14\u201315).

Suspected respiratory infections, including VAP, are the biggest drivers of antimicrobial use in the ICU [57]. Qualitative analyses, however, suggest much of this utilization is unnecessary [7]. Our results indicate that clinicians should not initiate antibiotics solely on the basis of these independent signs. We suggest instead tailoring the urgency of antibiotics to severity of illness. In patients with suspected VAP and hemodynamic instability or severe hypoxemia, antibiotics should be started expeditiously regardless of clinical certainty. If patients are more stable, however, then more conservative approaches should be considered. Computed tomography, if available, may improve accuracy compared to plain chest radiography although this has not been sufficiently studied [58, 59]. Clinicians might also consider treating alternative causes of respiratory instability (e.g., diuresis, suctioning of mucous plugs) before starting antimicrobials in hemodynamically stable patients that can tolerate some delay in antibiotic initiation [60\u201362]. This approach has the potential to reduce antimicrobial utilization but requires further investigation to confirm safety. Notably, many RCTs have used VAP rates as primary outcomes [63]. Our study suggests this is an unreliable outcome. More concrete outcomes such as mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, and antimicrobial utilization may be more appropriate outcomes in such trials [63].",

This approach follows from the recognition that accurately diagnosing VAP using clinical signs is incredibly challenging, a sentiment that is supported by the results of this review. Instead, VAE surveillance focuses on detecting nosocomial deterioration in respiratory function from any cause, since this can be objectively defined through examining the trajectory of patients\u2019 ventilator settings. This approach emphasizes the importance of preventing both infectious and non-infectious complications of mechanical ventilation.

We assessed risk of bias for individual studies and used GRADE methodology to assess and contextualize our findings based on our overall certainty in effect estimates. This review also has limitations. First, we evaluated clinical signs independently. In practice, providers typically use combinations of signs and tests to arrive at a diagnosis. Unfortunately, not all combinations were amenable to meta-analysis, though we did evaluate the accuracy of CPIS and summarize some combinations of signs evaluated in individual studies. Second, since we performed a meta-analysis using the published literature, there was a lack of available details on the included patients, which precluded our ability to perform subgroup analyses to further identify sources of heterogeneity. In particular, the accuracy of clinical indicators may be influenced by prior exposure to antibiotics. Unfortunately, the included studies did not always indicate whether patients had been treated with antimicrobials prior to sampling, thus precluding a sensitivity analysis restricted to patients without prior exposure to antimicrobials. Third, our pooled estimates were mostly of low certainty, due to imprecision and inconsistency. This suggests the need for high-quality studies addressing this important topic. Fourth, there is likely clinical heterogeneity across studies, particularly with relation to subjective indicators, such as purulent sputum and chest radiography, which may vary between raters. Fifth, not all tests evaluated by histopathology as reference standard were also amenable to testing by BAL as reference standard. Finally, our study may suffer from spectrum bias. In particular, the reference standard of histopathology was largely applied to deceased patients and therefore may reflect test performance in patients with more severe disease. Our findings were consistent, however, when using quantitative BAL cultures as the reference standard.",

Reliance upon the presence of any of these indicators may result in misdiagnosis and possibly unnecessary antimicrobial utilization. These findings highlight the uncertainty of diagnosing VAP and underscore the need for better tools to help clinicians know when to start and stop empiric antibiotics for possible VAP.",
