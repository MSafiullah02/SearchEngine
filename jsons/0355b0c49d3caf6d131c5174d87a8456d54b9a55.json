Specifically, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) initially issued a contradictory statement with one sentence recommending suspension of post mortem procedures in suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases and a second sentence indicating that, if deemed necessary and appropriate, strict adherence to basic safety procedures be used while performing such autopsies. In a subsequent statement from OSHA the first sentence was dropped (9) . The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) issued extensive guidelines which included rigorous standards for morgues and autopsy facilities to be under negative pressure with specific standards for venting the air from the rooms (10). There followed a spectrum of administrative responses to the OSHA and CDC directives. But the overall effect has been to create more than necessary impediments for the task before us. Of note and particular relevance for the autopsy situation, Dr. Patricia Harris, President of the American Medical Association, has issued an important statement defending science in a time of fear and uncertainty (11) .",

There was very patchy and sparse interstitial chronic/lymphocytic inflammation, and chronic inflammation and edema in the bronchial mucosa.

Pulmonary pathology of the second case was dominated by acute bronchopneumonia with evidence of aspiration. Neither autopsy revealed viral inclusions, mucus plugging in airways, eosinophils, or myocarditis. The first case had a 402 g heart, marked 2 vessel coronary artery disease, and microscopic evidence of acute ischemic injury.

All of the patients The parenchyma of each of the lungs was diffusely edematous and firm, consistent with the clinical diagnosis of ARDS. Notably, regions of multifocal dark-colored hemorrhage were prominent. In some cases, small, firm thrombi were present in sections of the peripheral parenchyma on gross examination. Major histological findings were bilateral DAD with multifocal hyaline membranes; a comparatively mild-to-moderate lymphocytic infiltrate, composed of a mixture of CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes; and desquamated type 2-pneumocytes with apparent viral cytopathic effect consisting of cytomegaly, and enlarged nuclei with bright, eosinophilic nucleoli. The alveolar capillaries were notably thickened, with surrounding edema, and fibrin thrombi were present within capillaries and small vessels. A notable finding was the presence of CD61+ megakaryocytes, possibly representing resident pulmonary megakaryocytes, with significant nuclear hyperchromasia and atypia. These cells were found within alveolar capillaries, often in association with, and actively producing platelets. The fibrin and platelets present within small vessels also appeared to aggregate inflammatory cells, with entrapment of numerous neutrophils.\" With the exception of the patient on immunosuppression, no significant neutrophilic infiltrate was found within alveoli or the interstitium to suggest secondary infection.",

The dominant feature of AFOP is intra-alveolar fibrin \"balls\" or aggregates, typically in a patchy distribution. Organizing Mild to moderate troponin elevations, particularly if measured by the high sensitivity troponin assays (hs-Tn), must be interpreted with caution regarding the magnitude of myocardial injury and may not reflect extensive irreversible myocardial injury due to myocardial ischemia or myocardial inflammation. Overt myocarditis, characterized by inflammatory cellular infiltrates with associated cardiomyocyte damage, does occur with COVID-19 infection but is much less common than suggested by overinterpretation of troponin levels (39) (40) (41) (42) (43) . Right heart strain with pulmonary thromboembolism also can be associated with elevated troponin level.

Thus, the distribution of the ACE-2 receptor in various cell types in different organs determines the involvement of these sites in the progression of COVID-19. The diseases progresses from a pulmonary infection to a systemic disease. In addition to heart and lung, target organ involvement of brain stem, liver and kidneys have been reported (74) (75) (76) (77) . In this report, involvement of the spleen is documented. Even though histological changes in the kidney are relatively mild, many COVID-19 patients are experiencing clinical features of acute renal injury and failure (77) . Endothelial cell infection has been noted in at least two studies (17, 84) . Endothelial cell infection and endotheliitis appears to be an important underlying mechanism linked to vascular dysfunction and thrombotic events in the lung, kidney and possibly the heart and other organs (67, 84) .",

The major pulmonary finding was diffuse alveolar damage in the acute and/or organizing phases with virus identified in type I and II pneumocytes by electron microscopy. The kidney demonstrated viral particles in the tubular epithelium, endothelium, and podocytes without significant inflammation. Viral particles were also observed in the trachea and large intestines. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the cardiac tissue of a patient with lymphocytic myocarditis. RT-PCR also detected viral RNA in the subcarinal lymph nodes, liver, spleen, and large intestines.\" Two cases have been reported from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York(18). \"The first patient, a middle-aged male with well-controlled hypertension, was admitted after 9 days with typical COVID-19 symptoms.A nasopharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time RT-PCR amplification for both the SARS-CoV-2 ORF1 a/b and pan-Sarbecovirus E-gene, but the chest radiograph showed only mild bilateral pulmonary vascular congestion. He was treated for bacterial superinfection, with some improvement, but continued to require supplemental nasal oxygen. Serum ferritin and C-reactive protein were elevated. Repeat chest radiograph on hospital day 8 revealed new dense patchy left mid-lung and retrocardiac opacities, and a hazy opacity in the right lower lung. On day 9, the patient complained of increasing left inspiratory chest pain and tenderness, and 30 minutes later developed pulseless electrical activity.\" \"The second patient, a middle-aged male with asthma, hypertension and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection controlled on highly-active antiretroviral therapy, was admitted with a 2-day respiratory illness history. A nasopharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2. He was febrile on admission, and chest radiography showed multiple bilateral lung opacities. Elevated ferritin and C-reactive protein were noted. His condition deteriorated, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilator support. Eight days following admission he developed pulseless electrical activity.\" \"At autopsy, a common notable finding was pulmonary thromboembolism, with occlusion of the right main pulmonary artery in one case, and occlusion of both left and right pulmonary arteries in the second. Deep venous thrombosis was found in both cases. Other findings were multiple foci of pulmonary consolidation, cardiomegaly and left ventricular hypertrophy consistent with hypertensive cardiovascular disease. There was no mention of cardiomyocyte injury or myocarditis.\" \"Ultrastructural examination demonstrated pleomorphic viral-like particles ranging from 60 to 120 nm in distended cytoplasmic vacuoles within the pneumocytes in lung specimens from both cases. The individual spherical viral-like particles displayed distinctive projections with mature particles exhibiting electron dense centers, consistent with the appearance of coronavirus. Fibrin deposition within and outside capillaries as well as pure platelet thrombi also were noted. \" IV. HOUSTON CASES Case One was a moderately obese (BMI 33.8 Kg/m 2 ) 62-year-old Hispanic man with a few-day history of respiratory illness who was found dead in his car. A medicolegal autopsy was performed. Nasopharyngeal swab at the time of autopsy tested positive by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 virus. Hepatitis panel (A, B, C) was negative. The hemoglobin A1C was 7.0%. The lungswere heavy (right 820 grams, left 770 grams), but were free of major thromboemboli and hemorrhages. Histologically, the picture was that of early DAD with multiple hyaline membranes accompanied by a focal and mild inflammation with modest numbers of CD3+ lymphocytes and more numerous CD68+ macrophages in some alveolar spaces(Figures 1 and 2). There also were collections of reactive pneumocytes exhibiting cytomegaly, nucleomegaly with prominent nucleoli, and mitotic figures. Some alveoli showed squamous metaplasia of the alveolar lining, presumably derived from the same reactive pneumocytes. By immunohistochemistry, the pneumocytes in the alveoli were TTF-1 and CK-7 positive and the clusters showing squamous metaplasia were P40 and CK5/6 positive. Many alveolar capillaries contained megakaryocytes identified by large, hyperchromatic nuclei. No microthrombi were identified on histological examination.",

On admission , chest radiograph showed cardiomegaly and diffuse bilateral interstitial opacities in the lungs. The CT chest findings included diffuse ground glass opacities of rounded morphology involving the upper and lower lobes of both lungs (Figure 8). The pulmonary artery was dilated at 3.4 cm (normal less than 3.15 cm) indicative of pulmonary hypertension. A pulmonary embolism was not identified. There was global cardiomegaly and a trace pericardial effusion. Electrocardiogram showed left ventricular hypertrophy with left axis deviation. The patient's laboratory findings included white blood cell count of 4.0/\u00b5L with 81.5% neutrophils (absolute 3.28), lymphocytes 12.4% (absolute 0.50), monocytes 5.2%(absolute 0.50) eosinophils 0.2%, and basophils 0.5%, platelets 190/ \u00b5L, hemoglobin (Hg) 11.2 g%, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 70.8, and red cell distribution (RDW) 36. and mildly elevated serum troponin with a peak of 0.22 ng/mL (normal < 0.045 ng/mL). Hemoglobin A1c was 6.3%. On admission brain naturetic peptide (BNP) was 428 pg/mL and troponin was 0.09 ng/mL (normal <0.045 ng/mL). Troponin later peaked at 0.22 ng/mL. Ferritin, D-dimer, prothrombin time, and partial thomboplastin time were not measured. Creatinine on admission was 1.0 mg/dL (normal 0.7-1.3 mg/dL) and remained normal until a final reading of 2.4 mg/dL. The patient was initially treated with antibiotics which was deescalated to supportive case when the nasopharyngeal swab test (RT-PCR) came back positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus. Tests for influenza and respiratory syncytial virus were negative. Working diagnoses in addition to COVID-19 infection were non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (NYHA class 3) with acute on chronic combined systolic and diastolic heart failure. The patient had a 10-day hospital course marked by recurrent fever, episodes of hemoptysis and shortness of breath. He received supplemental oxygen at 3-5 liters per minute but he was never placed on a mechanical ventilator. On the day of his death, he experienced severe worsening of respiratory failure followed by pulseless electrical activity. At autopsy, the major gross findings were extremely congested lungs (1980 grams combined weight) with multiple bilateral segmental pulmonary thromboemboli and multiple areas of hemorrhage, confirmed histologically as acute, unorganized thrombi (Figure 9). The heart that weighed 1070 grams with four-chamber hypertrophy and dilatation and patent coronary arteries with minimal atherosclerosis. The thickness of the left ventricular wall was 1.5-1.6 centimeters and that of the right ventricular wall was 0.5 centimeters. The brain was not examined. Histologically the myocardium showed epicardial lymphocytic infiltrates; cardiomyocyte hypertrophy; multifocal interstitial and replacement fibrosis; scattered damaged individual cardiomyocytes, and no inflammatory foci indicative of myocarditis (Figure 10). By immunohistochemistry, there were 7-10 or less CD3+ T cells and rare CD68+ macrophages per high power field in the myocardium. Lymphocytic infiltrates composed of CD 3+ T cells with were present in the epicardium with a CD4/CD8 ratio of 2:1. Random sections of the sinoatrial and atrioventricular conduction system showed no abnormalities. The lungs showed multiple bilateral segmental acute thromboemboli with associated areas of pulmonary hemorrhage and infarction (Figure 9). Away from these areas, the lungs showed evidence of an interstitial lymphocytic pneumonitis with lymphocytic infiltrates around small blood vessels and in the walls of terminal bronchioles extending into alveolar septae (Figure 9). Microthrombi were found in some pulmonary arterioles. The alveoli contained multiple deposits of fibrin without well-formed hyaline membranes and clusters of pneumocytes. By immunohistochemistry, the pneumocytes in the alveoli were TTF-1 and CK-7 positive and the clusters showing squamous metaplasia were P40 and CK5/6 positive. No microthrombi were identified. The heart showed evidence of individual damaged cardiomyocytes. No inflammatory infiltrates were present. The liver showed moderate macrosteatosis without inflammatory infiltrates. The spleen showed features similar to the spleen of Case One with generalized reduction in amount of white pulp and no evidence of HLH. The kidneys showed an occasional fibrin-platelet thrombus in renal glomerular capillaries. The testis exhibited thrombi in peri-testicular veins (Figure 10). The brain was not examined. Case Three was a 48-year-old obese (BMI 35.2 Kg/m 2 ) Hispanic man who was found dead at his residence. A medicolegal autopsy was performed. Nasopharyngeal swab at the time of autopsy tested positive by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 virus. Screen for influenza viruses was negative. On opening the body, purulent tan opaque watery fluid measuring 500 ml was found in the right pleural cavity. Yellow translucent deposits were focally present of the visceral pleura along the upper/middle interlobar fissure. Organized tan to greenish exudate with fibrotic thickening was present along the parietal and visceral pleural surfaces of the lower lobe. These were features of an empyema. The right lung was collapsed. Minimal fluid was found in the left pleural cavity, pericardial sac and peritoneal cavity. Bacterial cultures of the right pleural cavity and lung grew mixed flora consistent with postmortem contamination. The right and left lungs weighed 1020 and 960 grams, respectively. The treacheobronchial tree was lined by a hyperemic red-brown mucosa with no mucous plugs. The major pulmonary arteries were free of thromboemboli. The parenchyma of the lungs was dull red-brown and firm. The heart weighed 670 grams. The coronary arteries showed minimal atherosclerosis and were widely patent. Both ventricles were dilated. The thickness of the left ventricular free wall and interventricular septum was 1.6 centimeters and that of the right ventricle was 0.3 centimeters. On histological examination, the right pleura exhibited a necro-inflammatory infiltrate overlying cellular granulation tissue confirming the diagnosis of empyema. The right lung showed evidence of atelectasis as well as evidence of DAD. The DAD was more pronounced in the expanded left lung. The changes consisted of multifocal hyaline membranes, intra-alveolar fibrinous exudate, abundant intra-capillary megakaryocytes, numerous intra-alveolar macrophages, and activated type II pneumocytes, along with some neutrophils and intraalveolar hemorrhage (Figure 11). Multifocal lymphocytic infiltrates were present in the epicardium. CMC showed enlarged hyperchromatic nuclei. Individual CMC showed changes of acute injury. No inflammatory cellular infiltrates were found. Additionally, there were prominent foci of CMC disarray, particularly involving the superior portion of the interventricular septum. Many of the intramural coronary arteries showed intimal and medical thickening with luminal narrowing. The myofiber disarray and intramural coronary vasculopathy are diagnostic features of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Random sections of the sinoatrial and atrioventricular conduction system showed no abnormalities.The liver showed moderate macrovesicular steatosis, lymphoplasmacytic triaditis with portal fibrosis and early portal-portal bridging fibrosis. The kidneys showed mild hyaline arteriolosclerosis and periglomerular hyaline arteriolosclerosis with rare holosclerotic glomeruli. The spleen showed lymphocyte depletion in the white pulp with absence of marginal zones; the red pulp was expanded with congestion and hemorrhage; abundant plasma cells were present in the red pulp. The brain showed no significant histopathological change.V. DISCUSSION",

            "text": "pneumonia in the form of luminal loose fibroblastic tissue is present surrounding the fibrin (32-34). Hyaline membranes are absent. The acute interstitial pneumonia of Hamman-Rich syndrome is characterized by the simultaneous presence of both acute and organizing DAD (32, 59). Copin et al. recently have reported the findings from postmortem biopsies in 6 patients (36). The one patient who died after a 5-day course showed a lymphocytic viral pneumonia with DAD pattern. The 5 other patients who died after about 20 days of symptoms had the histological pattern of AFOP. Correlation with pathophysiological showed that the first patient had a type L pattern of low pulmonary elastance whereas the other 5 patients had a type H pattern of high pulmonary elastance. Our patient who died after a 10-14-day course had a lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis with intra-alveolar fibrin deposits and no hyaline membranes or foci of organizing pneumonia. This pattern may represent a transition from the DAD to the AFOP patterns. Interstitial pneumonitis with DAD and AFOP patterns has been described in the original SARS disease. Going forward, more extensive and detailed correlation of the clinical, imaging and pathological changes of the pulmonary component of COVID-19 is needed. Vc. Cardiovascular System The cardiovascular system is majorly impacted in many patients with COVID-19 disease. Clinical features are indicative of acute myocardial injury as manifested by elevated serum troponin level, arrhythmias and ST segment elevation and/or depression on electrocardiogram in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease (29-31, 60-64). Tavazzi et al. obtained an endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) from a 69-year-old patent with a flulike illness due to SARS-CoV-2 infection that was successfully treated with venous-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) and mechanical ventilation. Endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) demonstrated low-grade myocardial inflammation and viral particles in the myocardial interstitial cells but not in cardiomyocytes or endothelial cells (65). The ultrastructural study demonstrated single or small groups of viral particles with the morphology ( dense round viral envelope and electron-dense spike-like structures on their surface) and size (variable between 70 and 120 nm) of coronaviruses (66). The authors interpreted the findings as evidence of direct involvement of the myocardium during a viremic phase or migration of infected macrophages from the lung. Grimes et al. demonstrated 60 to 120 nm \"viral-like\" particles in distended cytoplasmic vacuoles within pneumocytes as well as rupture of the cytoplasmic vacuoles with release of the virus-like particles into the alveolar lumen (18). The individual spherical viral-like particles had distinctive projections with mature particles exhibiting electron dense centers, consistent with the appearance of coronaviruses.",

Grimes et al. point out that several viral infections have been associated with coagulation disorders that may lead to thrombosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)(18).Both influenza virus and SARS have been associated with pulmonary intravascular thrombi formation and fibrin deposition likely as a result of DIC and microthrombosis. In SARS coronavirus infection, increased production of a novel pro-coagulant by infected cells due to increased hfg12 gene transcription induced by viral nucleocapsid (N) protein has been proposed as a mechanism contributing to thrombosis(18,78).Fox et al. noted pulmonary microvascular thrombi, CD4+ T cells around the thrombosed vessels, focal hemorrhages, abundant megakaryocytes in pulmonary capillaries, platelet aggregation, platelet-rich clots, associated entrapment of neutrophils, and fibrin deposits inside and outside of capillaries(16). We also observed entrapment of neutrophils in capillaries and fibrin deposits within and outside of capillaries. We concur with the suggestion of Fox et al that an important pathogenic mechanism of fatal COVID-19 disease is a thrombotic microangiopathy primarily involving the lungs. Variation in the demonstration of microthombi in the lungs may relate to the stage of the coagulopathy at the time of death. In DIC, microthrombi are found in multiple organs in relationship to the peak of clot formation but may not be found when the DIC has progressed to depletion of clotting factors and activation of fibrinolysis(79)(80)(81)(82)(83).",
