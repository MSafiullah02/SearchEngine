Respiratory specimens that were culture negative for a panel of respiratory viruses were examined for the presence of hMPV by RT-PCR. The results indicated that 59 out of 546 (10.8%) children were hMPV-positive. The majority of these hMPV-positive children were less than 2 years old (59.4%), females (61%), and inpatients (67.8%). Infections occurred throughout the year, but peaked during the spring and/or summer months. Sequence analysis of the fusion gene from the isolates revealed two phylogenetic groups with five possible lineages (A1, A2a/A2b, B1, and B2). Among these co-circulating strains, A2 strains were most frequently observed and demonstrated the greatest divergence. Deduced amino acid sequence analysis identified several variant amino acids specific to the A2 lineage.",

Similar to the avian metapneumovirus (AMPV), hMPV lacks nonstructural proteins NS1 and NS2 and posses three surface glycoproteins, the fusion (F), attachment (G), and small hydrophobic (SH) proteins. The G protein attaches to host cells, whereas the F protein directly mediates membrane fusion [15] . It is known that the greatest genetic diversity among hMPV strains occurs in the structural genes; therefore, both G and F genes have been widely used for phylogenetic analysis in the context of genetic lineages [2, 3, 10, 28] .",

However, it is currently unclear whether the variations in the F gene that lead to alterations of F protein's functional motifs are the main determinants of the epidemic features of hMPV. In addition, F protein has been demonstrated to contain major antigenic determinants that mediate extensive cross-lineage neutralization [3, 23] and cross-protective immunity [11] . Detailed analysis of the sequence variation of F genes among clinical isolates is therefore critical for defining the molecular evolution of the F gene and may provide clues to understanding the epidemic features of the virus.",

A total of 23 hMPV-positive RT-PCR samples were sequenced, and the sequences (nucleotide 706-1071 of the F gene) were subjected to phylogenetic analysis in comparison to a Canadian isolate, CAN98-75 (GenBank accession no.

The phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1) showed that two distinct hMPV genogroups (A and B) with at least four possible subgroup lineages (A1, A2, B1, and B2) were cocirculating during the study period. Subgroup A2 was further divided into A2a and A2b lineages with the bootstrap values of 81 and 63%, respectively. Since the A2b bootstrap value was less than the 75% limit, the phylogenic relationship between A2a and A2b was re-evaluated by maximum likelihood and parsimony methods (data not shown). The re-evaluation supported the presence of two distinct lineages for the A2 subgroup. hMPV A2 strains were more frequently identified in children during the study period (15 out of 23 strains), and A1 variants were frequently detected in 2005 from March to May ( Table 2 ).",

            "text": "In this study, we provide genetic evidence identifying the major circulating viral variants that may contribute to the epidemic features of hMPV infection in a longer period from September 2003 to August 2005. Our results revealed all five defined hMPV lineages in southern Taiwan and indicated that the variants in subgroup A2 were more frequently identified in the study period. Seasonality was observed for hMPV infection in southern Taiwan, as hMPV activities were frequently observed during spring and summer months. Overall, the peak of infection in southern Taiwan was similar to that in California in 2004 [6, 31] , with less hMPV activity observed in the fall and winter in southern Taiwan. This trend of hMPV infection was observed during both years of the 2-year study period and was similar to high and low incidences in other reports [10, 24] . The detection of group A and B variants in 2004 supported that at least two hMPVs in distinct genetic clusters could co-circulate in a single year during a respiratory season [1, 2, 5, 18, 28] . Furthermore, children were infected more frequently by group A strains, which agrees with Boivin et al. [4] and suggests that age may be a critical fitness factor for group A strains. Also, Boivin et al. [4] have noted a possible shift of infection towards A2 strains in recent years. This was supported by our observation that 75% of the strains from the hMPV-positive specimens belonged to the A2 genotype. It is possible that the cocirculation pattern among children in southern Taiwan is similar throughout the world, and the genetic variations in the A2 subgroup may have certain functional relevance critical for the transmission. On the other hand, a recent report has described a complex circulation pattern based on the sequence variations within the G gene, and certain variations were critical for evading preexisting immunity [13] .",

No respiratory specimens were collected from this patient during the 45-day period of the two positive specimens. According to the identical F gene of the two strains, we considered these two consecutive positive specimens to be the result of prolonged shedding of hMPV.",

We have previously reported that hMPV also contributes substantially to acute respiratory tract infections in children of Taiwan with respiratory symptoms and signs similar to those of other RV infections, except for the severity of skin rash and duration of fever, together with the presentation of feeding difficulties, tachycardia, and minimal cough [31] . This study further supports the unique epidemic pattern of hMPV in children in southern Taiwan based on the genetic analysis of F gene. These hMPV variants simultaneously circulate with seasonal distribution and may account for many of the undiagnosed infections in Taiwan.",
