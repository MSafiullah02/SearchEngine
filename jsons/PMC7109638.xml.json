As such, the use of quarantine actually affects the number of infections generated by symptomatic individuals. Second, if quarantine has no effect on transmission from symptomatic individuals, it will still cause \u03c1 to be nonzero if there is some transmission during the asymptomatic phase.

Figure 2a plots equation 1 with I0 = 1 for different values of the product q\u03c1. This represents the number of cases averted by quarantine for each initially infected individual. Even if quarantine is extremely effective (i.e., q\u03c1 = 1), which requires that all asymptomatic individuals be identified and placed into quarantine (i.e., q = 1) and that an individual generates no new infections once quarantined (i.e., \u03c1 = 1), quarantine still has only a marginal effect on the expected number of infections averted over a wide range in R\u0304I (which, recall, is the expected number of infections generated by an infected person if isolation alone is used). For example, if the reproduction number is R\u0304I = 0.5, then quarantine is predicted to prevent only one extra infection for each individual that was initially infected. The number of infections averted becomes significant, only when the effectiveness of isolation decreases to the point where it is no longer able to stop the spread of disease (i.e., only when R\u0304I approaches one). Also note that, because of the form of equation 1, its predictions are relatively insensitive to error in the estimates of R\u0304I unless R\u0304I is close to one (figure 2).\n",

This can be better illustrated by plotting the percentage of infections that are averted by quarantine (i.e., the first factor in equation 1). Figure 2b illustrates how this increases to 100 percent when the effectiveness of isolation decreases (i.e., when R\u0304I increases). We can also see that, if most infections are generated by symptomatic individuals and if quarantine does little in terms of increasing the efficiency of isolation procedures (so that \u03c1 \u226a 1), then quarantine will have very little effect on the number of cases averted or on the percentage averted.

This question is more difficult to answer but, subject to some mild assumptions, one can derive a conservative estimate that applies for any distribution of infections generated by each infected individual, p1(\u00b7) or pQI(\u00b7) (Web appendix 2). Figure 3 plots a conservative 80th-percentile upper bound on the number of infections averted through the use of quarantine, for the best-case scenario in which the probability of quarantining an infected individual is one (i.e., q = 1). There is at least an 80 percent probability that the actual number of infections averted through the use of perfect quarantine in any given outbreak lies below these upper bounds. These results are very general and further strengthen the finding that quarantine is unlikely to have a significant impact unless isolation alone is relatively ineffective (i.e., R\u0304I is large). Furthermore, these analytical results appear to be quite conservative when judged against results from a fully stochastic simulation (Web appendix 3).\n",

This appears to be true for several diseases (table 1; Web appendix 4), including SARS (1, 4, 9, 20). To apply the results to SARS, we require an estimate for the reproduction number when isolation alone is being used. There are currently no direct estimates of this parameter available, but we can estimate it indirectly by using the component parameter estimates of Gumel et al. (14). Bearing in mind the uncertainty in such estimates, we obtain a potential range of values from R\u0304I = 0.28 to R\u0304I = 0.46. Taking R\u0304I = 0.5 as a conservative estimate, the results given by the bold curve in figure 3 (for which \u03c1 = 0.05) suggest that there is a probability of at least 80 percent that the use of perfect quarantine for SARS (i.e., q = 1) would reduce the number of cases by no more than approximately 2.6 cases for each initially infected person (assuming that the values \u03c3I = 0.5 and \u03c3QI = 0.25 of figure 3 are reasonable for SARS). This is a very conservative upper bound on the expected outcome, however, and therefore, unless the variance in the number of infections generated by individuals is much larger than those used to generate figure 3, the use of quarantine is predicted to have very little effect. As a result, investing limited resources in ensuring that isolation is very effective (e.g., quick removal of symptomatic people from the population; extremely secure isolation facilities to prevent transmission by such individuals) is likely to be a much more valuable control strategy for SARS than the use of mass quarantine.\n",

It must also be true that a large proportion of infections generated by an individual can be prevented through quarantine (i.e., \u03c1 is large). How can we estimate this parameter for different diseases? As a first approximation, we can equate \u03c1 with the proportion of infections generated when an individual is asymptomatic (5). We can then use the data on the length of infectious periods, along with incubation, latency periods, and the likelihood of completely asymptomatic infections occurring for different diseases to estimate \u03c1 (Web appendix 4). Table 1 presents estimates of the proportion of infections that are generated by asymptomatic individuals for a variety of diseases. The diseases with the largest values of \u03c1 are smallpox and hepatitis B, whereas those with the smallest values of \u03c1 are whooping cough and scarlet fever.",

One possibility is to ensure the strictest adherence to quarantine protocols. This will ensure that the number of infections generated by individuals in quarantine is as small as possible. Second, quarantine can be used to enhance the speed of isolation of symptomatic individuals (e.g., because asymptomatic individuals in quarantine are under close scrutiny). In this case, quarantine would reduce the number of infections generated by an individual, in part, by reducing the number of infections generated by symptomatic individuals. If this is the main reason for \u03c1 being large, however, then there is an alternative to quarantine that might be more suitable. Rather than placing the suspected asymptomatic people into quarantine, simply inform them of their status and tell them to report to a hospital at the first sign of any symptoms. This approach has nearly all the benefits of quarantine in terms of enhancing isolation procedures without incurring the costs of actual quarantine.",

Furthermore, if the asymptomatic period is very long, then the quarantine period must also be correspondingly long (21). Such lengthy quarantine periods would be very difficult to implement, again making it unlikely that q can be made very large. For example, even though the value of \u03c1 is large for hepatitis B (table 1), it is unlikely that q could be large enough for quarantine to prove a useful control measure for this disease.",

For some quarantining techniques such as contact tracing, however, increasing the resources devoted to this task in the hopes of increasing q might also increase \u03c1. In other words, not only would asymptomatic individuals have a greater likelihood of being quarantined, but they would likely be placed into quarantine more quickly as well (thereby potentially increasing \u03c1). As a result, it is important to bear in mind that any real-world public health intervention can result in alterations to more than one of the relevant parameters in the theory developed here.",
