The use of siRNA and shRNA as antiviral therapeutic is limited because of the emergence of viral escape mutants. This problem is theoretically prevented by intracellular expression of lhRNAs generating multiple siRNAs that target the virus simultaneously, thus reducing the chance of viral escape. However, gene constructs encoding lhRNA molecules face problems with delivery to the right cells in an infected individual. In order to solve this problem, we constructed an HIV-1 variant with a 300 bp long hairpin structure in the 3' part of the genome corresponding to the Nef gene (HIV-lhNef).",

Due to its sequence specificity, RNAi is a potentially selective method for intracellular immuniza-tion against HIV-1 infection. RNAi-mediated suppression of HIV-1 replication has been accomplished by synthetic small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in a transient manner [3] [4] [5] [6] and by shRNA expression vectors in stably transfected cells [7] [8] [9] . Despite potent inhibition, the use of both approaches as therapeutic antiviral is limited because of the rapid emergence of HIV-1 escape mutants [9] [10] [11] . Strategies to reduce the chance of viral escape include the simultaneous use of multiple siRNAs [12, 13] , the intracellular expression of a second generation of escape-anticipating shRNAs [14] , or microRNA-based double-stranded RNAs (miRNAs), which do not require perfect sequence complementarity for inhibition [15, 16] .",

However, lhRNA approaches raise concerns about induction of the dsRNAtriggered interferon (IFN) response. Others and we have shown that endogenously expressed lhRNA and dsRNA can inhibit HIV-1 production without induction of the innate antiviral response [18] [19] [20] [21] . In fact, most reports on IFN induction by long dsRNAs in mammalian cells are based on transfection of cells with in vitro synthesized dsRNAs [22, 23] .

Stable expression of such constructs renders the cells resistant to infection [25, 26] . lhRNA can inhibit HIV-1 production under certain conditions, without induction of the IFN response [6, 17, 18] . Ideally, a single lhRNA should generate multiple effective siRNAs upon intracellular processing, providing more durable inhibition of HIV-1 than a single shRNA. An additional advantage of lhRNA inhibitors is that it does not require pre-determination of the optimal shRNAs and corresponding HIV-1 target sequences because multiple effective siRNAs will be produced. A potential disadvantage of the use of lhRNA as therapeutic is that the generation of multiple siRNAs will be more likely to cause off-target effects.",

Similarly, we were not able to obtain stable expression of the lhRNA inhibitor from a lentiviral vector (results not shown), probably due to problems in reverse transcription of the excessively stable hairpin structure [29] . The presence of the lhNef insert resulted in a dramatic drop of the viral transduction titer, possibly also due to self-targeting of Nef/LTR sequences in the vector genome.

The results for all AS variants are summarized in Table 1 and shown in Additional files 1, 2 and 3. Intriguingly, variant R1 co-existed with the wild-type virus for 62 days (Fig. 6B ). This result confirms that the Nef function is not important in T cell lines. However, because the AS variants were able to outcompete HIV-1, it raises the interesting possibility of hairpin-mediated (trans) inhibition by these AS variants. Perhaps even more surprisingly, AS19 and R1 co-existed for the length of the competition experiment. We speculate that the deletion mutant R1 may lack target sequences for trans-inhibition by AS19.",

One possibility is that the mechanism of HIV-1 inhibition by HIV-lhNef or the AS mutants could be RNAi-related. One of the hallmarks of RNAi is its sequence-specificity. We therefore tested if HIV-lhNef could inhibit the Luc-Nef reporter, in which a 250 nt Nef target sequence was placed downstream of the Photinus luciferase gene [11] . As a positive control, we showed that HIV-lhNef induced a dramatic decrease of wild-type HIV-1 production in trans, comparable in efficiency with the highly effective RNAi-inducers shGag and shNef [13] (Fig.  7A) . However, no sequence-specific inhibition of the Luc-Nef reporter was obtained with HIV-lhNef (Fig. 7B) . The shGag molecule serves as a negative control in this experiment, and shNef as a potent positive control. In these transient transfection experiments a Renilla luciferase expression plasmid was included, which provides a control for transfection efficiency and possible aspecific effects. Renilla luciferase expression was similar in all transfections (results not shown), indicating that HIV- Figure 3 Virus replication of HIV-lhNef and the escape variants in PBMC.

However, HIV-lhNef did not replicate to detectable levels in HIV-1 target cells, probably because steps of its replication cycle are affected by the hairpin insertion, e.g. RNA splicing, RNA nuclear export or mRNA translation. Moreover, HIV-lhNef may cause degradation of its own mRNA due to processing by the RNAi machinery. We postulate that the lhNef hairpin may induce an antiviral response against wild-type HIV-1 either through a sequence-specific RNAi mechanism or through aberrant HIV-1 transcripts lacking the 3' non-coding region and polyA tail that induce a potent HIV-1-specific RNA silencing response in cells. Tests with reporter constructs do not support a sequence-specific RNAi effect, although the effect induced by lhNef is HIV-1 specific. The mechanism of trans-inhibition is currently unknown, but it remains of interest to study the molecular details because the observed inhibition is extremely potent. We are currently dissecting the mechanism of inhibition by testing HIV-lhNef variants that lack important RNA signals (TAR, polyA, PAS, PBS, DIS, SD, psi).",

It has been suggested that any therapeutic intervention aimed at either completely blocking or at least partially reducing the expression of Nef during HIV-1 infection would likely enhance the ability of the immune system to fight HIV infection [34] . Humans infected with Nef-defective HIV-1 strains show low viral loads and no or very slow disease progression and represent long-term non-progressors or long-term slow-progressors [31, 35] . Moreover, macaques vaccinated with a SIV strain that only lacks Nef are better protected against superinfection than macaques vaccinated with a SIV strain lacking the three accessory genes Nef, Vpr and Vpx [36] . The cross-protection conferred by the attenuated SIV strains appears not to be based on stimulation of the adaptive immune system, but on other (unknown) mechanisms [37] . In this study, we demonstrate effective outgrowth of the Nef-minus AS escape variants in competitions with wild-type HIV-1. This result was obtained in the SupT1 T cell line, which does not provide a clear Nef-phenotype. We think that this outcompetition is related to the presence of the genomic hairpin structure, because no such effect was observed for the control Nef-deletion virus R1. These in vitro results may relate to the superior protection with Nef-deleted viruses in vivo.",

We have previously shown that a 19 nt shRNA expressed from conditionally replicating HIV-1-based virus, can inhibit viral replication [27] . Any hairpin longer than that should in theory mediate trans-inhibition of HIV-1. Further research is needed to see if we can design constructs that are replication competent, yet remain a potent trans-inhibitor of HIV-1. For example, a lhRNA variant with G-U wobbles could be designed, which will destabilize the RNA structure and therefore stimulate viral replication.

HEK293T cells were co-transfected with 150 ng HIV-1 and 150 ng pSuper-shNef, HIV-lhNef, the AS escape mutants or R1. CA-p24 production was measured in the culture supernatant at two days post-transfection. Error bars represent the standard deviation from quadruple transfections in two independent experiments. Virus competition experiments in PBMC. (A) Two viruses were mixed as indicated on top of the panels, usually in a 1:1 ratio (unless indicated otherwise, see panel B). The composition of the virus mixture was followed by PCR across the Nef region with primers tTA1 and CN1 (seeFig. 1A). The experiment has been repeated 5 times for AS19. Appropriate markers and molecular weight standard (M) are indicated. The identity of the respective PCR fragments is indicated on the right. (B) Competition of HIV-1 and AS19 mixed in three ratios: 10:1, 1:1, 1:10. (C) Competition between the R1 variant and either HIV-1 or AS19. R1 is a 106 nt Nef deletion mutant. The experiment has been repeated twice, with similar results. inhibition of HIV-1 is specific and not due to non-specific effects, e.g. due to IFN induction by dsRNA.",

PCR amplification was performed in a 50 \u03bcl reaction containing 1 \u00d7 PCR amplification buffer (Invitrogen), 0.5 mM MgCl 2 , 25 pmol of each primer, 0.2 mM dNTPs and 2.5 units of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Perkin Elmer Applied Biosystem). The PCR program was as follows: 95\u00b0C for 5 min, 30 cycles of 30 sec at 94\u00b0C, 30 sec at 55\u00b0C, 30 sec at 72\u00b0C, and a final extension for 7 min at 72\u00b0C. The PCR products were separated on a 1% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide and compared to a standard DNA size marker (Eurogentec). HIV-lhNef could not be amplified with this PCR due to the extended inverted repeat that may form a cruciform DNA structure. The RNA structures formed by HIV-lhNef and the AS escape variants were predicted with the Mfold program",
