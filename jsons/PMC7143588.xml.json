There is usually a history of an antecedent viral infection of the upper respiratory tract that causes congestion of the respiratory mucosa and obstruction of the isthmus of the Eustachian tube. Negative middle-ear pressure results and an effusion develops in the middle ear. The effusion may become colonized with bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, group A \u03b2-haemolytic streptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus) from local or haematogenous spread, resulting in acute otitis media. Increased hydrostatic pressure in the middle ear and enzymatic activity may cause rupture of the tympanic membrane and mucopurulent otorrhoea. Infection may extend from the middle ear through the aditus into the mastoid antrum (resulting in mastoiditis), or into the inner ear (resulting in labyrinthitis). In mastoiditis, bony septa of the mastoid air cells are destroyed and an abscess forms. Osteomyelitis of the temporal bone may occur via emissary vessels or direct local spread. Laterally, this may result in a subperiosteal abscess of the mastoid bone which occasionally spreads to the zygomatic arch or along the fascia of muscles attached to the mastoid, resulting in a lateral neck abscess (\u2018Bezold\u2019s mastoiditis\u2019).

Bones lodged proximally in the mucosa of the tonsil, pharyngeal wall or tongue base may be removed under topical anaesthesia using a tongue depressor or laryngoscope blade and grasping forceps. Those lodged in cricopharyngeus or the oesophagus require removal under general anaesthesia with a rigid oesophagoscope; coins or dental prosthetics require the same method of removal. Sharp objects are drawn into the lumen of an advancing endoscope, and endoscope and foreign body are removed together to prevent mucosal trauma. Oral intake may be restricted to sterile fluids initially if small mucosal lacerations are present.
