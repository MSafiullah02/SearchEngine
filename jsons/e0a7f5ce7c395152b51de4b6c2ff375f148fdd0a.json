By 2 April 2020, confirmed cases were consecutively reported in majority of countries in the world. At this time, the rapid spread of the virus had caused 896,450 cases and 45,525 deaths globally [1] . So far, the large-scale epidemic has not been controlled, and the number of cases worldwide is still rising. Therefore, the routes of transmission have likely contributed considerably to the rapid spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). It has been proven that the respiratory droplets and direct contact are the major routes for COVID-19 infection [2] . However, the route of fecal-oral and aerosol transmission, including through the ocular surface, have not been totally determined. Cutting off the route of transmission is one of the most important measures in the prevention and control of infectious diseases. Whether the ocular surface is a route of transmission remains to be proved.",

Viruses could be detected in nasal and throat swabs from three rhesus macaques 1 to 7 days after inoculation. Fourteen and 21 days after conjunctival inoculation with the virus, specific IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in the rhesus macaques, indicating that the animal was indeed infected with SARS-CoV-2 [5] .
