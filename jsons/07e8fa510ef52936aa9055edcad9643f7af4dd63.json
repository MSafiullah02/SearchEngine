On Friday February 28th, the nation's first reported death due to COVID-19 infection was disclosed, followed by the 2nd mortality case a mere 48 hours later. Both were end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients dialyzing with Northwest Kidney Centers in our ambulatory clinics, and subsequently under the care of our Hospital Services team. Over the course of that weekend, our organization was brought to the forefront of the COVID-19 pandemic, mandating an immediate and coordinated response. Our approach to managing the threat in our outpatient facilities has been summarized elsewhere 1 . This editorial will focus on the acute care setting by considering the following three questions:",

An important consideration is the percentage of patients who will ultimately require renal replacement therapy. The need for dialysis usually arises during the 2nd week of infection and affects 5% of ICU patients 9 , patterns that are consistent with estimates from the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) pandemics, both caused by coronaviruses bearing a high degree of sequence homology to SARS-CoV-2.",

While this argument has been made repeatedly in the management of sepsis, clinical evidence has been, at best, inconclusive 10 . Decisions in our local community around dialysis modality have been informed by the acuity of illness, with continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) or slow low efficiency dialysis 4 (SLED) reserved for those patients who are too sick to tolerate conventional intermittent hemodialysis. In the absence of data clearly demonstrating superiority of one modality over another, choice of dialysis modality should be informed foremost by resources readily available and where local clinical expertise lies.",
