            "text": "\nGiardia duodenalis (syn: G. lamblia) infections are highly prevalent in domestic ruminants throughout the world (reviewed by O\u2019Handley and Olson, 2006). Typically, infections occur in ruminants around one month of age and are chronic or reoccurring, with cyst excretion continuing for months after initial infection. As with other hosts, the clinical signs associated with G. duodenalis infections in ruminants can vary. Subclinical infections are often reported; however, G. duodenalis infections are also associated with the occurrence of diarrhea and ill thrift in calves (O\u2019Handley et al., 1999, Geurden et al., 2006). More importantly, previous research has shown that G. duodenalis infections can result in significant production losses in lambs, thus raising concern that giardiasis may be a production limiting disease in livestock (Olson et al., 1995, O\u2019Handley et al., 2000a, Aloisio et al., 2006). Additionally, although ruminants are most commonly infected by the livestock specific G. duodenalis of genetic assemblage E, they can also be infected with G. duodenalis of the zoonotic genetic assemblage A. Thus, domestic livestock have the potential to serve as a reservoir for human giardiasis (O\u2019Handley et al., 2000b, Trout et al., 2004, Uehlinger et al., 2006).",

            "text": "Due to the high prevalence, potential production impact, and zoonotic potential of G. duodenalis infections in domestic ruminants, recent research has examined the potential for controlling G. duodenalis infections in ruminants through chemotherapy. Paromomycin and the benzimidazole drugs, such as fenbendazole, show efficacy against giardiasis in dairy calves (Xiao et al., 1996, O\u2019Handley et al., 1997, Geurden et al., 2006). However, due to the high level of G. duodenalis cysts in their environment, calves are readily reinfected immediately following treatment (O\u2019Handley et al., 2000a). Continuous administration of drugs, such as fenbendazole or paromomycin may allow for long-term control of giardiasis in ruminants. However, this type of treatment regimen is likely not useful or economically feasible for livestock producers. A vaccine to prevent and control G. duodenalis in domestic ruminants could be a practical and cost-effective approach. Currently, a sonicated whole G. duodenalis vaccine, made with trophozoites isolated from sheep, is available for dogs and cats in North America (Olson et al., 2000). Clinical trials demonstrated that sub-cutaneous administration of this vaccine in young, growing dogs and cats results in the reduction of G. duodenalis cyst in the feces, elimination or reduction of G. duodenalis trophozoites in the intestines, prevention of clinical disease, and significantly higher weight gains compared to non-vaccinated animals (Olson et al., 1996, Olson et al., 1997). Provided this vaccine had similar efficacy in domestic ruminants, it could reduce or eliminate the role of domestic ruminants as reservoirs for G. duodenalis infections in humans and may provide an economic benefit to livestock producers by preventing production losses associated with giardiasis. Therefore, this study evaluates the efficacy of a G. duodenalis vaccine in preventing giardiasis in calves.",

A study has also been conducted on the use of a G. duodenalis vaccine as a therapeutic agent in dogs and cats. Olson et al.

            "text": "We can only speculate as to why this vaccine failed to prevent G. duodenalis infection in calves. The vaccine failure in the calves may have been due to the large inoculation dose used for challenge or due to continuous exposure to cysts within the environment following challenge, despite regular cleaning and disinfection. However, higher challenge doses (106\nG. duodenalis cysts) were used in other vaccination studies where the vaccine was efficacious (Olson et al., 1996, Olson et al., 1997). Antibody titers in dogs and cats increased rapidly within 3 weeks of vaccination (Olson et al., 1996, Olson et al., 1997). Titers increased more rapidly after a booster injection on day 21. In our study, calves were given a booster injection on day 28, 4 weeks after initial vaccination, and 1 week later than in the cats and dogs. Nevertheless, the serological response in the calves followed a similar trend as in the dogs and cats: the titers increased within a week after vaccination and increased more rapidly after a booster injection. It is possible that the presence of maternal antibodies in the calves could have interfered with vaccination in this study. Both groups had a similar mean antibody titer, presumably maternal antibodies, at the beginning of the study, which declined prior to vaccination. Although a previous study has demonstrated that maternal antibodies to G. duodenalis decline within 30 days in dairy calves, sufficient maternal antibodies may have been present when vaccinations were carried out in this group of calves. However, the impact of maternal antibodies on vaccine efficacy is controversial, and recent studies have indicated good vaccine efficacy despite administration in the presence of maternal antibodies (Martelli et al., 2006, Zimmerman et al., 2006), while other studies reported a negative impact of maternal antibodies on vaccine efficacy. Few studies have examined the immune response of ruminants following G. duodenalis infection, but a weak serum immune response was observed following natural infection in both lambs and calves and this is thought to account, in part, for the chronicity of infection in ruminants (Yanke et al., 1998, O\u2019Handley et al., 2003). Although calves mounted a serological immune response following vaccination, it is possible that vaccination did not stimulate immunity locally within the gut, and a localized immune response is important in the elimination of infection (Gottstein et al., 1990). In addition, recent research has shown that ruminants are most commonly infected with G. duodenalis corresponding to the genetic assemblage E (O\u2019Handley et al., 2000b, Appelbee et al., 2003, Trout et al., 2004, Trout et al., 2005, Trout et al., 2006), which was also the genotype used to challenge the calves in this study. Although the genotype of G. duodenalis comprising the vaccine is not known, it would not be assemblage E as this assemblage has yet to be cultured in vitro. Thus, antigenic differences between the genetic assemblages could account for the failure of this vaccine to prevent G. duodenalis infection in calves.",
