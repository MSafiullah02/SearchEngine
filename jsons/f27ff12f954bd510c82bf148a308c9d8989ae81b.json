Therapies used to prevent rejection suppress the immune system and as a result, the transplant recipient is often at high risk of infection. Prolonged and frequent exposure to healthcare settings and multiple antibiotics may predispose the transplant recipient to colonization or infection with multidrug-resistant organisms. The use of good infection prevention and control practices is extremely important throughout the continuum of care for solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients. In the hospital setting, antimicrobial-resistant pathogens often cause the infections identifi ed during admission or after discharge, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality.",

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued guidelines for the prevention of infection for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients, but not specifi cally for SOT recipients. Pertinent guidelines on infection prevention and control issues have been developed by the CDC and the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) to provide specifi c recommendations that are pertinent to all patient populations. Guidelines referenced in this chapter include the Guideline for Hand Hygiene in Health-Care Settings-2002 [ 1 ] , Guidelines for Preventing HealthCare-associated Pneumonia, 2003 [ 2 ] , Guidelines for Environmental Infection Control in Health-Care Facilities, 2003 [ 3 ] , Management of Multidrug-Resistant Organisms in Healthcare Settings, 2006 [ 4 ] , Guidelines for Isolation Precautions: Preventing Transmission of Infectious Agents in Healthcare Settings, 2007 [ 5 ] , and the Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 [ 6 ] . The American Transplant Society has published guidelines for the management and prevention of infections in organ transplant candidates and recipients which address specifi c aspects of infection control practices pertinent to transplantation [ 7 ] . The Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) have also published a compendium of strategies to prevent healthcareassociated infections (HAIs) in acute care hospitals [ 8 ] . These strategies, most recently revised in 2014, highlight basic prevention practices that are often referred to as \"bundles,\" guidance to infection control programs regarding implementation of these practices, as well as special approaches for infections that are not controlled using basic infection control practices. Despite the publication of expert guidance documents and guidelines some issues are still unresolved. The authors of this chapter describe some of the practices in their institutions, while acknowledging that different approaches to the same problem might exist. 46 .1 Healthcare-Associated Infections 46 ",

Invasive devices such as central venous catheters (CVCs), indwelling urinary catheters, and ventilators expose the patient to additional risks for infection. Most facilities have implemented infection prevention \"bundles\" designed to prevent these device-associated HAIs. Due to the success seen in reducing HAIs, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) issued new guidelines. After October 1, 2008, hospitals no longer receive additional payment for cases in which selected conditions were not present on admission, which include CVC-associated bloodstream infections and catheter-associated urinary tract infections [ 9 ] . What this means to hospitals is that claims are paid as though the secondary diagnosis was not present. These \"Hospital-Acquired Conditions\" (HACs) are considered \"never events,\" but may still be problematic in transplant recipients. Careful attention must be given to good hand hygiene practices and CVC care, as well as to practices that decrease the risk of catheter-associated urinary tract infection.

Revised in 2007, the Guideline for Isolation Precautions: Preventing Transmission of Infectious Agents in Healthcare Settings 2007 [ 5 ] updated and expanded the 1996 Guideline for Isolation Precautions in Hospitals . The transition of healthcare delivery from primarily acute care hospitals to other healthcare settings (e.g., home care, ambulatory care, freestanding specialty care sites, and long-term care) created a need for recommendations that could be applied in all healthcare settings using common principles of infection control practice, but could be modifi ed to refl ect settingspecifi c needs. In this revision, the term \" nosocomial infections\" was replaced by \"healthcare-associated infections\" to better refl ect the changing patterns in healthcare delivery. It may be diffi cult to determine the exact site of exposure to an infectious agent and/or acquisition of infection as patients move through the healthcare delivery system. The SARS experience, and more recently, the experience with Ebola virus disease , highlighted the need to better prepare for new emerging pathogens and focused on the ways minor breaks in infection control technique resulted in infections being transmitted to healthcare professionals. Sections of this guideline were created as evidence mounted that environmental controls could decrease the risk of fungal infections in severely immunocompromised patients. While the Protective Environment (PE) has been found to be of greatest benefi t for patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants, there may be some lessons to be learned from successful implementation in this group of patients. Organizational characteristics (e.g., nurse staffi ng levels and composition, establishment of a safety culture) are also identifi ed as key components to promote adherence to recommended infection control practices. Combining the universal precautions and body substance isolation precautions, contact with human blood, body fl uids, secretions or excretions (except for sweat), nonintact skin, mucous membranes, and contaminated items requires the use of personal protective equipment, as part of standard precautions. Respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette, safe injection practices, and the use of masks during insertion of catheters or injection of material into spinal or epidural spaces via lumbar puncture procedures were added to standard precautions in 2007. Transmission-based precautions are used, in addition to standard precautions, to prevent infections spread by airborne, droplet, and direct contact routes. Certain infections that had required disease-specifi c isolation precautions are now included under standard precautions.",

Included in this category are epidemiologically signifi cant organisms, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), Clostridium diffi cile , and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Private rooms are recommended, but patients colonized or infected with the same organism(s) may be cohorted together, if necessary. If neither of these options is achievable, the immunosuppressive state of potential roommates should be evaluated. For example, placing a VRE-colonized patient with an otherwise healthy 30-year-old who has a broken leg would be preferable to placing that patient with a postoperative transplant recipient who might become more easily colonized and infected. Contact precautions require gloves and gowns be worn for contact with the patient or potentially contaminated items and areas in the patient room. While the likelihood of transmission to other patients through contact with clothing is remote, caregivers are likely to touch their own clothing (e.g., lab coat pockets) and thus transmit the organism on their hands. The 2006 HICPAC/CDC guideline, The Management of Multidrug-Resistant Organisms in Healthcare Settings, recommends donning gowns and gloves upon room entry and discarding them before exiting the room of a patient with organisms that have been implicated in environmental transmission (e.g., VRE, C. diffi cile , noroviruses and other intestinal tract agents, and RSV) [ 4 ] .",

The CDC has three specifi c defi nitions of nosocomial pneumonia [ 11 ] . No defi ned incubation period exists when fungal pneumonia is suspected, so the traditional \"onset of infection 48 hours after admission\" standard that separates community-acquired infections from hospitalacquired infections is not valid. The isolation of fungal species from expectorated sputum may not be diagnostic, but clinicians often start antifungal therapy when they are encountered. These isolates could also represent transient colonization or a laboratory contaminant, not necessarily invasive disease [ 21 ] . Therefore, comparing fungal pneumonia rates among hospitals is diffi cult. Because of the ubiquitous nature of circulating fungal spores and of generally higher spore counts outdoors, determining whether a discharged patient who is readmitted with invasive fungal pneumonia acquired the infection while he or she was in the hospital is challenging. Comparative data on the incidence of nosocomial fungal pneumonia are unavailable, and many institutions have attempted to develop their own defi nitions of hospital-associated fungal pneumonia. Table 46 -2 details the case defi nitions at some of the authors' institutions; an arbitrary hospitalization of 7 days prior to onset of infection is used to distinguish between hospital-and communityacquired fungal infections. A recent review of construction and renovation-related healthcare-associated fungal infections showed a decrease in number of outbreaks between 2010 and 2014, which may be due to effectiveness of infection prevention measures, or because of the high number of previously reported outbreaks [ 22 ] .",

The hospital water system may be a potential reservoir for Aspergillus and other molds, which are then aerosolized [ 24 ] . No \"safe levels\" for bioaerosols have been recognized, and standards for the frequency of air sampling are also lacking. Rural outdoor air concentrations of fungi may be as high as 10,000 colonyforming units per cubic meter of air (CFU/m 3 ) without causing pulmonary infections in the general population. The establishment of a safe threshold limit in the indoor environment is problematic. Some studies have established a positive correlation between increased airborne spore counts and the incidence of invasive aspergillosis [ 25 -27 ] .",

Open agar plates, which are commonly referred to as \"settle plates,\" should not be used to estimate the airborne concentration of fungal spores. The number of spores that settle on the agar due to the effects of gravity are presumed to be proportional to the airborne concentration, but are not reliable enough for routine use in facilities that perform organ transplants. Settle plates, however, may detect fungi aerosolized during medical procedures (e.g., during wound dressing changes), as described in an outbreak of aspergillosis among liver transplant patients [ 28 ] . Air sampling methods using calibrated sieve impactors or centrifugal samplers are recommended to provide standardized counts, the results of which are expressed as CFU per cubic meter. Routine air sampling for fungi is not generally recommended. During construction or renovation or in times when isolates of Aspergillus or other fungi are identifi ed in patient cultures, air sampling may be performed to assess the relative level of spores in the environment. Outdoor samples may be collected as appropriate controls. Fungal colony types found in the indoor samples should be the same as those from outdoor samples, but with a tenfold (1 log) reduction in indoor counts due to air-handler fi ltration [ 29 ] .

It is beyond the scope of this review to detail all recommendations in that guideline but several specifi c infection types are discussed.

Specially designed isolation rooms that use laminar air fl ow (LAF) and/or high-effi ciency particulate air (HEPA) fi ltration may provide the cleanest air possible.

HEPA fi lters may be installed within the room ventilation system to provide a highly fi ltered, positively pressurized room, or portable units may be placed in any patient room for additional air fi ltration. Patient rooms should be tightly sealed to prevent contamination from outdoor sources, and their doors should remain closed to ensure positive pressurization. Reportedly, areas that use HEPA fi ltration and positive pressurization of patient rooms (fungal spore control ventilation) have total spore counts of less than 15 CFU/m 3 , with Aspergillus counts of less than 0.1 CFU/m 3 [ 29 ] .",

At the beginning of renovation, airborne particulates and fungal spore counts may be exceptionally high because spores are dispersed into the environment during the demolition process. The Facility Guidelines Institute publishes guidelines for the design and construction of hospital and healthcare facilities [ 30 ] . Infection control personnel should be involved from the planning stages through project commissioning. Building owners are required to provide an infection control risk assessment (ICRA) to determine the potential risks of transmission of various infectious agents during the project. The ICRA is conducted by a panel with expertise in infection control and epidemiology, risk management, facility design, construction ventilation, and safety. An ICRA should be conducted during the early planning phase of the project, before construction begins, and continue through project construction and commissioning. Specifi c construction-related requirements mandated by the ICRA should be included in the contract documents. Many state health departments now require the ICRA submission before they will issue permits for hospital construction and renovation projects. When construction or renovation activities are planned in or near facilities that handle high-risk transplant recipients, even more strict protective guidelines and monitoring requirements may be established during the planning process [ 31 ] . Such guidelines help to defi ne the appropriate barriers and techniques for preventing the spread of dust and debris into other areas of the facility. Construction and housekeeping personnel should be trained in the dangers of aspergillosis, with an emphasis on control measures. Strategies for the prevention of nosocomial aspergillosis will control any other fungi that are transmissible by dust, such as the zygomycetes (e.g., Mucor and Rhizopus species). Infection control interventions to prevent nosocomial aspergillosis were well illustrated during one constructionassociated outbreak, in which the incidence of invasive aspergillosis rose from 3.18 to 9.88 cases per 1000 patientdays during the construction period [ 32 ] . The control measures that were used included portable HEPA fi ltration units, the installation of sealed windows and easy-to-clean tiles and shades, and the increased maintenance of the ventilation sys-tem. The introduction of portable HEPA fi lter units was the most important step in this undertaking. After the institution of control measures, the infection rate decreased to 2.91 cases per 1000 patient-days.",

            "text": "If a case of nosocomial aspergillosis is suspected, it is crucial to look at the facility history of aspergillosis cases to assess background rates. An investigation of any ventilation deficiency is very important [ 2 ] . If there is a good chance that the case is healthcare-associated, then an epidemiologic investigation should be initiated in an effort to fi nd and eliminate the source. Aspergillus fl avus has frequently been identifi ed in reports of construction-related contamination of the indoor environment [ 33 ] . Arnow et al. [ 34 ] reported an increase in spore counts of Aspergillus fumigatus and A. fl avus , with a mean of more than 1 CFU/m 3 associated with the opening of a new hospital. An environmental assessment identifi ed fungal contamination of the carpet, fi reproofi ng material, and ventilation fi lters. Fungi may contaminate damp areas, discolored ceiling tiles, and peeling wallpaper. Most studies documented decreased indoor spore counts after the institution of appropriate control measures [ 31 , 33 ] . Sometimes, air sampling is recommended for the assessment of air contamination after construction or HEPA fi lter changes and as part of an outbreak investigation. Repeat air samples may be collected after an identifi ed source is decontaminated or removed. An environmental audit may also include periodic sampling. The role of fungal typing in the investigation of outbreaks is unclear; multiple fungal strains can cause healthcare-associated infections in one outbreak given the ubiquitous presence of fungi in the environment and the identifi cation of different serial Aspergillus strains by whole genome sequencing within a single patient [ 35 ] may limit the application of this epidemiological tool. Aspergillus species are certainly not the only signifi cant fungal pathogen found in the environment. Fusarium and Trichosporon species, the dematiaceous molds, zygomycetes, and normally innocuous soil and plant fungi may cause infections in the immunocompromised patient. Good housekeeping practices are vital in high-risk patient areas. These areas should be visually monitored to ensure that all dust is contained and removed from the patient environment. If nosoco-mial infections occur within an institution, the renovation of ventilation systems to provide highly fi ltered air for high-risk patient areas may be considered. Although antifungal prophylaxis of patients may be useful, cases may still occur, necessitating the temporary closure of contaminated patient units or a suspension of transplant activities during hospital construction projects.",

Legionella species multiply in warm water, with an ideal temperature range of 35-46 \u00b0C [ 38 , 39 ] . Regulations concerning maximum water temperature, which are designed to prevent scalding accidents, often fall into this range, increasing the possibility that a facility will become contaminated with Legionella species and several other species of nontuberculous mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium xenopi [ 40 ] . Traditionally, it was believed that infection was caused by the inhalation of contaminated aerosols generated by humidifi ers, air-conditioning units, cooling towers, and showers into the respiratory tract. The aspiration of contaminated water is an additional mechanism of transmission [ 41 , 42 ] . Laboratory-confi rmed Legionellosis in a patient who has spent \u226510 days continuously in a healthcare facility prior to the onset of illness is considered a defi nite case of healthcare-associated Legionella p neumonia; that which occurs in a patient who has spent 2-9 days in a healthcare facility prior to the onset of illness is considered possible healthcare-associated Legionellosis [ 2 , 3 ] . The 2003 CDC guidelines for the prevention of nosocomial pneumonia discuss issues of environmental monitoring and control.

The type of hot water system, the water temperature, location, and building age all play a role in the colonization of pipes within a facility [ 43 ] . The monitoring and control of Legionella species in a healthcare facility require a team effort, in which the microbiology laboratory, infection prevention and control, and maintenance departments must work together to provide a safe environment for high-risk patients. The CDC does not recommend routine environmental culturing for Legionella , but guidelines state that (1) this could be a component of Legionella prevention in healthcare facilities that provide care to transplant recipients, (2) may be appropriate to identify the source of infection as part of an outbreak investigation, and (3) to assess the effectiveness of water treatment or decontamination protocols [ 2 , 3 ] . No guidelines regarding culturing frequency or acceptable levels of positivity are available. Generally, each facility will establish a policy on environmental monitoring that is dependent on the patient population. Environmental investigation to identify the source of Legionella is recommended when there is an outbreak, defi ned as one case of defi nite or two cases of possible healthcare-associated Legionnaires' disease within a 6-month period [ 3 ] .",

Systems that use holding tanks or heaters that allow water to stagnate in the bottom of the tank provide a reservoir for the multiplication of Legionella species. For immediate control of Legionella in the setting of an outbreak, thermal eradication (superheat and fl ush) or hyperchlorination of the water supply is recommended [ 3 ] . Ongoing control of Legionella could be done with the use of copper/silver ionization systems, which release low concentrations of metal ions into the water distribution system, ultraviolet light sterilization, or maintenance of an elevated water temperature or chlorine content [ 44 , 45 ] . Point-of-use fi lters have been found to be effective in eliminating Legionella and could be used without modifi cation or disinfection of the potable water system [ 46 ] , though are not on the current guidelines. In transplant units, shower heads and tap aerators should be removed, cleaned, and disinfected monthly using a chlorine-based, EPA-registered product; a 1:100 dilution of bleach may be used if no EPA-registered chlorine disinfectant is available [ 3 ] . In addition, largevolume room air humidifi ers that generate aerosols should not be used unless they are subjected to high-level disinfection and only sterile water is used. Even when control mechanisms are in place, healthcareassociated legionellosis may occur. Disruptions in the water distribution system, such as water main breaks, the use of fi re hydrants, fl oods, and internal maintenance and construction disruptions, may cause changes in water pressure that disrupt the biofi lm within the potable water system [ 38 ] . When pieces of the biofi lm break free and enter the water supply, the water may appear cloudy or dirty. Local water authorities may issue water restrictions in the event of major contamination of the drinking water supply. Establishing water service disruption policies can be helpful for protecting immunosuppressed patients. Substitution of the appropriate bottled water is encouraged for drinking and for mouth care. Ice machine fi lters may become contaminated, so fi lters should be changed after restoration of water service [ 47 ] . Suspending showering until the water is determined to be safe may be necessary. When service is restored, all fi xtures should be fl ushed until the water appears clear. Tub bathing may be acceptable because little aerosolization of the water occurs during the bathing process. Bed baths or other systems that do not generate aerosols are recommended.",

Gramnegative bacteria with ESBLs are typically sensitive to the carbapenems, which are recommended as treatment for infections due to these organisms. Recently, K. pneumoniae with a carbapenem hydrolyzing enzyme, which confers resistance to all carbapenems, have been reported, and this organism caused 8% of device and surgery-associated HAIs [ 63 , 97 ] . Though named KPC ( K. pneumoniae carbapenemase) as this was initially found in K. pneumoniae , KPC has been reported in other enterobacteriaceae, including E. coli, Enterobacter species, and Serratia [ 94 , 98 ] . There is variation in the geographic distribution of ESBL-containing organisms. While it occurs sporadically in various states, K. pneumoniae with KPC has become endemic in the eastern United States and spread throughout the USA is increasing [ 99 ] . Infections caused by carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae are associated with high mortality rates among liver transplant recipients [ 100 ] .",

Patients should be placed in private rooms or cohorted with other infected patients. Symptomatic patients should be placed on contact precautions. Healthcare personnel should wear gloves and gowns when they enter the patient's room. Patient transport outside the unit should be minimized if the patient has diarrhea to avoid contaminating other areas with the bacterial spores. Good hand hygiene is essential. Soap and water or alcohol hand sanitizer may be used in routine or endemic settings; soap and water is preferred for outbreak or hyperendemic settings. Staff members must observe proper procedures, and visitors should be encouraged to wash their hands thoroughly before leaving the patient's room. A dilute (1:10) hypochlorite solution or a product with an EPA-approved claim for C. diffi cile activity should be considered in units with high C. diffi cile rates [ 6 ] . During outbreaks, environmental decontamination, isolation or cohorting of infected patients, and the limitation of clindamycin have signifi cantly reduced CDD [ 125 ] . The use of dedicated patient equipment or of disposables, such as rectal thermometers, may significantly reduce the incidence of CDD in both acute and chronic care facilities and should be used whenever possible [ 126 ] .",

In a series of three adult liver transplant recipients who developed varicella hepatitis, one patient died after developing adult respiratory distress syndrome and disseminated intravascular coagulation [ 162 ] . The introduction of a vaccine has signifi cantly reduced varicella-zoster morbidity and mortality. Its use has been expanded since 1999 to include HIVinfected children with CD4 percentage of 15-24% and adults with CD4 count of at least 200 cells/\u03bcL [ 163 ] . There are two vaccines currently available: Varivax, a single-antigen varicella vaccine, and ProQuad, a combination of varicella and MMR vaccines. The latter contains more virus than the former vaccine [ 164 ] . Varicella vaccine is contraindicated in the transplant recipients, because it is made from a live, attenuated virus. However, the experience with leukemic children has shown that the vaccine is safe and effective [ 163 ] . Some reports have also demonstrated that the live, attenuated vaccine is safe and effi cacious in susceptible pediatric kidney transplant recipients [ 165 ] . Researchers in that study administered the vaccine at candidacy; the results showed a reduced incidence of varicella after transplantation. There are also some reports of vaccination after transplantation. In one of these, seroconversion occurred in 20 of 31 (64.5%) children; 7 required multiple doses and only minor local skin reactions were observed [ 166 ] . The risk that healthy individuals will develop a rash after vaccination and transmit it to an immunosuppressed patient is low, and, therefore, vaccinating susceptible individuals, including healthcare workers, living in the same household with transplant recipients is not contraindicated [ 164 ] . The vaccine manufacturer does recommend that healthcare workers who develop vesicles should not care for susceptible individuals. Although some have hypothesized that the vaccine strain of virus may not be capable of causing secondary infections, a few such cases have been documented [ 167 , 168 ] . The general consensus is that the benefi ts of vaccination of household contacts of immunocompromised individuals outweigh the very low risk of transmission of the vaccine virus to the transplant recipient. Varicella vaccine is also used in healthy persons as a post-exposure preventive measure, mostly in unvaccinated children, ideally within 3-5 days after exposure [ 169 ] .",

Although breakthrough infection after varicellazoster immunoglobulin (VZIG) administration was common, its use ameliorated the severity of the disease. In one study in a SOT pediatric population receiving VZIG (median age of 8 years), 55% developed varicella, but only 4% developed severe disease [ 171 ] . The usual dosage is 125 units for each 10 kg of weight, up to a maximum of 625 units. If another exposure occurs more than 3 weeks after the administration of the VZIG dose, an additional dose of VZIG should be administered to provide continued passive immunity [ 169 ] . Patients who get monthly high-dose IVIG (>400 mg/kg) are protected if the last dose was given less than 3 weeks before exposure [ 161 ] . Because varicella immune globulin could prolong the incubation period by \u22651 week, patients given VariZIG should be monitored for signs or symptoms of varicella for 28 days after exposure. Antiviral therapy should be started as soon as signs or symptoms of varicella occur. Acyclovir may also prevent or attenuate infection after VZV exposure and may constitute a valid alternative, especially in those cases that come to medical attention more than 10 days after exposure. Some authors have advocated using it with VZIG in cases where life-threatening VZV infection is possible, such as in children with renal disease who are receiving steroids [ 172 ] . Acyclovir is FDA approved for the treatment of varicella in healthy children. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends consideration of acyclovir treatment of individuals at risk of moderate or severe varicella [ 173 ] . The value of acyclovir as a prophylactic agent in the immunocompromised host is unclear; VariZIG is recommended after exposure of these individuals to VZV. There is limited data to support the use of acyclovir for post-exposure prophylaxis in healthy children [ 174 ] though some experts support this approach in immunocompromised patients, particularly if VariZIG is unavailable.",

The infection control aspects of respiratory viral infections are similar, and RSV is described here as an example. In recent years, the importance of these viruses in SOT recipients has received more recognition, as has the realization that these viruses cause signifi cant morbidity [ 179 ] . These viral infections could be followed by superinfection with bacterial pathogens, leading to bacterial pneumonia, and they have also been associated with acute and chronic rejection, particularly in lung transplantation [ 180 , 181 ] .

Reinfection is common, but, in the healthy host, it is self-limited and generally mild. Outbreaks in the community usually occur seasonally, with peaks in the late spring and autumn that last until winter [ 184 ] . There is variability of onset of infection from year to year as well as between various regions in the USA [ 185 ] . For example, in Florida, the RSV season comes earlier and lasts longer [ 186 ] . The virus may be spread in nurseries, causing severe respiratory infection in infants who have underlying medical conditions, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, congenital heart disease, or prematurity [ 187 ] . Viral shedding usually lasts for a week, but this period may be longer in infants who are younger than 1 month of age or in those with pneumonia [ 188 ] . Nosocomial infections often parallel outbreaks in the community. RSV can survive drying, and it can stay viable for 6 hours on surfaces and fomites, including gloves [ 189 ] . Transmission occurs by direct contact with a person who sheds the virus in the form of droplets or from contact with contaminated hands, handkerchiefs, eating utensils, or other articles. Viral particles may be inoculated into the eyes and nasal mucosa by touching these areas with contaminated hands [ 189 ] . Therefore, nosocomial outbreaks may occur not only from patient to patient but also from caregivers or visitors having a \"cold\" [ 190 , 191 ] .",

This is due to the suboptimal response of transplant recipients to protein vaccines, and it raises the question of the use of antiviral chemoprophylaxis in the future. During the H1N1 April 2009 infl uenza A pandemic, of the reported 237 solid organ transplant recipients with H1N1, 32% developed pneumonia, 16% were admitted to ICU, and 4% died [ 204 ] . Organ recipients, their families, and the healthcare providers must realize the importance of receiving the annual inactivated infl uenza vaccine to reduce the risk of disease transmission. CDC, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), and the HICPAC recommended that all US healthcare workers get annual infl uenza vaccine [ 205 ] . The live, attenuated infl uenza vaccine (LAIV) administered as a nasal spray is not recommended for immunocompromised patients but may be given to close contacts of immunosuppressed individuals, though persons caring for patients in a protective environment should avoid contact with such patients for at least 7 days after receipt of LAIV [ 206 ] . Parainfl uenza and adenoviruses may also cause lifethreatening infection, and they may also be spread nosocomially [ 207 , 208 ] . Rapid identifi cation of these respiratory viruses, especially in pediatric wards, will help in cohorting staff and patients when an epidemic is recognized in the community [ 209 ] ",

Several viruses are associated with gastroenteritis, including rotavirus, norovirus, enteric adenovirus, caliciviruses, enteric coronavirus, and astrovirus [ 210 ] . Rotaviruses and noroviruses are the most epidemiologically signifi cant agents of the gastroenteritis viruses, causing endemic and epidemic disease throughout the world. In particular, the rotaviruses have been associated with outbreaks in children and in developing countries where they have been associated with high mortality rates [ 211 ] . The symptoms often include vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration. Fever may be present. Dehydration may be severe enough to require hospitalization for intravenous fl uid replacement. The incubation period ranges from 1 to 3 days, with symptoms usually lasting less than 1 week. The transmission of rotavirus occurs through the fecal-oral route, with maximum viral shedding in the stool occurring 2-5 days after the onset of diarrhea. Nosocomial infections have been associated with the insuffi cient use of appropriate infection control measures. Rotavirus infections represent between 20% and 40% of the cases of nosocomial diarrhea in children [ 212 , 213 ] . There has been an association between rotavirus gastroenteritis and rejection of small bowel allograft but this may have been related to decrease in immunosuppressive agents due to diarrhea [ 214 , 215 ] . In the USA, most infections occur in children between the ages of 6 and 24 months after maternal antibody protection wanes [ 216 ] . Infections occur more frequently between October and April. Usually, the virus produces a self-limited diarrhea; however, premature infants and transplant recipients may develop severe disease [ 210 ] . Although rotaviruses do not generally cause bloody stool, fecal occult blood loss has been reported in pediatric liver transplant recipients [ 217 ] .",

Patient-to-patient transmission may result in miniepidemics within the hospital [ 210 ] . Adult contacts of patients with rotavirus may exhibit subclinical illness [ 213 ] . Infection control measures should be instituted promptly whenever patients are incontinent or develop diarrhea. Standard precautions are adequate unless the patient is incontinent or diapered; contact precautions should be added in such cases. Good hand hygiene is essential, with glove and gown usage for patient contact if fecal contamination is likely. Cleaning of room surfaces with an EPA-registered hospital disinfectant is adequate for cleaning of surfaces in the patient's room [ 5 ] . The institution of infection control measures interrupted an outbreak in a pediatric oncology ward that was presumed to have occurred through contaminated toys [ 218 ] . These included contact precautions, and the daily cleaning of playroom with a dilute bleach solution.",

This is an oral live vaccine which was developed from human and bovine virus and has not been associated with intussusception [ 220 ] . It is given in three doses at 2, 4, and 6 months with completed administration by 32 weeks of age. A second vaccine Rotarix (GlaxcoSmithKline) was licensed in April 2008. It is live attenuated oral vaccine and is given to infants in two doses at 2 and 4 months infants. The two vaccines are equivalent. Although the original studies have not shown an association, post-licensure studies did demonstrate low risk of intussusception in certain populations [ 221 ] , and support for use of the vaccine is universal. Between November 2007 and May 2008, delayed onset and reduced rate of rotavirus infection was observed [ 222 ] , attributed to the introduction of the rotavirus vaccine. There are no data available regarding the safety and effi cacy of this vaccine in immunosuppressed infants. It is believed that infants who live in the same household with immunosuppressed patients can still be vaccinated despite the small risk of transmission of the vaccine rotavirus [ 219 ] .",

In 2011, the CDC published Guidelines for the Prevention of Intravascular Catheter-Related Infections to help address this issue[ 13 ]. The incidence of infection varies with the type and intended use of intravascular devices. The two main device types are short term or temporary devices and those that are used for long-term access. Every device has some advantages and some risks. Attention should be focused on preventing site infections and on providing education for the patients and their caregivers if the catheter is not removed before hospital discharge.The basic approaches to preventing CLABSI include the following[ 13 ]:Before insertion 1. Educate healthcare personnel involved in the insertion, care, and maintenance of CVCs on CLABSI prevention. 2. Bathe ICU patients over 2 months of age with a chlorhexidine preparation on a daily basis.",
