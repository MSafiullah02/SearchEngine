Nucleotide sequence analysis has shown that the genus can be divided in three clusters (Kuno et al., 1998, Lindenbach and Rice, 2001), namely the mosquito-borne viruses, the tick-borne viruses and a third cluster for which no vectors have been identified. In turn the mosquito-borne cluster encompasses nine clades, including the clades of the yellow fever virus (YFV), and of dengue fever viruses (the four serotypes of which also form a serocomplex). The Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) serocomplex include viruses from three clades; the species in that complex include most notably JEV itself, West Nile virus (WNV), Kunjin encephalitis virus, Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVE), St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLE) and Usutu virus (Burke and Monath, 2001, Kuno et al., 1998, Lindenbach and Rice, 2001).",

Yet, the laboratory diagnosis of flavivirus infection remains unsatisfactory; isolation of these viruses is time consuming, and for many of them requires a biosafety level 3 installation. Serology tests other than neutralization assays frequently display cross reactivity between species. For all these reasons, development of molecular tests for these agents, including RT-PCR, has attracted a lot of efforts and attention. In this study we present a single tube RT-PCR assay for mosquito-borne flaviviruses, using a single pair of consensus primers. We show that the assay can detect several important species of flaviviruses with high sensitivity. Species identification is provided by sequencing the amplicons; in the case of dengue viruses this also permits the serotype determination.",

In each case, the identity of the amplicon was confirmed by sequencing. For the stocks of viruses that had been titrated, serial dilution of RNA allowed to estimate the equivalent limit of detection in plaque forming units (pfu), as shown in Table 1\n. In addition, for WNV the RNA serial dilution was used to compare the sensitivity of the assay described here with that of a commercially available quantitative RT-PCR kit (RealArt WNV LC RT-PCR kit, Artus GmbH). The sensitivity was found to be equivalent, with a measurement of approximately 16 genome copies (average of two experiments). The methods of RNA extraction used in the clinical laboratory at the Hospital for Sick Children typically extract RNA from a volume of 100\u2013140 \u03bcl, although for WNV testing the Qiaamp Ultrasense kit (Qiagen), with a volume of sample up to 500 \u03bcl, is preferred. It can be readily seen that the sensitivity obtained for all viruses tested is similar to that reported with assays for other flaviviruses (Scaramozzino et al., 2001, Busch et al., 2005, Kao et al., 2005, Kuno, 1998).",

A single negative RT-PCR would therefore not rule out a current infection and consequently, serological testing continues to play an important role in laboratory diagnosis in immunocompetent persons. Molecular testing would arguably be of greater usefulness in cases of suspected infection with WNV in immunocompromised patients, where the humoral response may be blunted and the viremia may be prolonged or of higher titer (Huang et al., 2002). In addition, molecular assays have been used as part of screening for blood and organ donors (CDC, 2005, Health_Canada, 2004, Kleinman et al., 2004). Finally, the use of a single polyvalent flavivirus PCR would be useful for the detection of flaviviruses in various vectors and non-human hosts, to aid in the monitoring of viral activity, including virus emergence.",

Given the increasing ease and affordability of automated sequencing, this is not a great imposition on clinical laboratories proficient in molecular techniques. Primers capable of detecting several viral species permit the use for a positive control of a viral sequence unlikely to be present in the area where the laboratory is located (for example, Kunjin virus RNA is now used at the hospital for sick children), thus eliminating a possible source of laboratory contamination of the assay. The implementation of this assay in a laboratory that must monitor, say, WNV, also means that an assay for more infrequent viruses is in fact kept ready in the laboratory. For example the diagnosis of acute infection with dengue 1 in a returning traveler could be confirmed in our laboratory with this assay (data not shown).",
