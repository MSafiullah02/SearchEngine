Important advances have been made in recent years to further understand the complex interaction of viruses with their hosts. Much of the pathology associated with viral diseases may be the result of an unbalanced virus\u2013host interaction, and in some cases it represents uncontrolled attempts of the immune system to destroy the virus leading to damage of the host. A more profound knowledge of the interaction of viruses with the host immune system will help us to understand the molecular mechanisms of viral pathogenesis.",

            "text": "Cytokines are a family of molecules that initiate and orchestrate the immune response and include growth factors, interferons (IFNs), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukins (ILs), and chemokines. Cytokines are normally secreted from cells, although some are expressed at the cell surface, and activate specific responses in cells expressing cognate receptors. The immune system utilizes this complex network of ligands and receptors to orchestrate the immune response. Thus, the activation of a particular set of cytokines as a result of viral infection determines the type of immune response that takes place. In addition, cytokines such as IFN and TNF may restrict virus replication by acting directly on the infected cell.",

            "text": "The importance of cytokines in antiviral defense is highlighted by the numerous mechanisms that viruses encode to block their activity (Alcami and Koszinowski, 2000; Tortorella et al., 2000). The primary purpose of the viral anticytokine strategies is to downregulate the immune responses to infection. However, viruses that replicate in immune cells may take advantage of the effects that cytokines have on cell physiology to enhance the ability of cells to support viral replication, thus promoting viral replication rather than evading the immune system. Viruses may block the synthesis and maturation of cytokines or may modulate cytokine signaling in the target cells. Large DNA viruses such as poxviruses and herpesviruses have captured in their genomes genes encoding host cytokines and cytokine receptors (McFadden and Murphy, 2000; Alcami, 2003; Seet et al., 2003).",

Major classes of PRRs include Toll-like receptors, C-type lectin receptors, retinoic acid\u2013inducible gene I-like receptors, nucleotide binding and oligomerization domain-like receptors, and cytosolic DNA-sensing receptors (Blasius and Beutler, 2010; Sancho and Reis e Sousa, 2012; Barbe et al., 2014; Wu and Chen, 2014). Upon engagement, these receptors recruit adaptor proteins that signal downstream and activate several major pathways: the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u03baB), the mitogen-activated protein kinases, and the IFN regulatory factor (IRF) pathway (Akira et al., 2006; Honda and Taniguchi, 2006). This pathogen-mediated activation leads to the production of IFN and proinflammatory cytokines. Numerous viruses have been shown to prevent this early activation of cytokines (see below).",

            "text": "There are several examples of viruses that inhibit cytokine-induced intracellular pathways, such as some of the anti-IFN mechanisms discussed below. The interaction of TNF receptors (TNFRs) and Fas with their respective ligands induces the binding of cytoplasmic factors that interact through death domains and death effector domains present in adaptor proteins and in some caspases. These pathways activate NF-\u03baB and other intracellular factors that trigger the activation of innate immune pathways. Molluscum contagiosum virus and KSHV encode inhibitors containing death domains that prevent signal transduction through receptors for TNF and Fas ligand and activation of caspase-8 (Bertin et al., 1997; Thome and Tschopp, 2001; Figure 1). An unrelated protein encoded by the UL36 gene from human cytomegalovirus also associates with caspase-8 and blocks its activation (Skaletskaya et al., 2001). Adenoviruses produce a number of proteins encoded by the E3 region that inhibit TNF- and Fas-mediated apoptosis (Mahr and Gooding, 1999; Wold et al., 1999). The adenovirus receptor internalization and degradation complex, formed by the E3/10.4K and E3/14.5K proteins, induces internalization and subsequent degradation in lysosomes of TNFR and Fas. As a result of this, the infected cell becomes resistant to TNFR- and Fas-mediated apoptosis (Burgert et al., 2002; McNees and Gooding, 2002). African swine fever virus replicates in macrophages, one of the major cytokine producers in the immune system, and encodes a homologue of the inhibitor of kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells that interacts with the transcription factors NF-\u03baB and nuclear factor\u2013activated T cell and prevents the transcription of cytokine genes (Miskin et al., 1998). Poxviruses encode numerous proteins that inhibit NF-\u03baB activation (Smith et al., 2013; Figure 1). For example, VACV encodes three intracellular proteins (A52, A46, and K7) that block signaling mediated by Toll-like receptors and the IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) by mimicking intracellular adaptor domains of these receptors (Bowie et al., 2000; Harte et al., 2003; Smith et al., 2013). Inhibition of both IL-1- and TNF-mediated NF-\u03baB activation is mediated by other VACV proteins, such as N1 or B14, that act downstream of the convergence of IL-1- and TNF-mediated signaling. Structural studies have shown that some of these VACV proteins (A52 and K7) have a B cell lymphoma-2 fold, a property that is shared with other VACV proteins that function as inhibitors of innate immune signaling pathways (Smith et al., 2013). During virus entry into cells, the interaction of measles virus with its cellular receptor CD46, a complement regulatory protein that protects cells from lysis by complement, blocks the production of IL-12, a potent inducer of IFN-\u03b3 and cellular responses (Figure 1).",

The latent membrane protein 1 of Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV), a virus that establishes latency in B cells, is a membrane protein that lacks sequence similarity to members of the TNFR superfamily but has a short cytoplasmic sequence that binds components of the TNFR and CD40 transduction machinery. In EBV-infected cells, the multimerization of latent membrane protein 1 in the absence of TNF leads to the recruitment of adaptor molecules and TNF-mediated biological responses such as cell proliferation that may enhance virus replication (Farrell, 1998). In this way, EBV takes advantage of a B cell activation pathway to ensure survival of the infected cell that carries the latent viral genome.",

For example, the T antigen of murine polyoma virus binds to and inactivates JAK1 (Weihua et al., 1998), whereas the protein V from simian virus 5 interacts with STAT1 and induces its degradation by the proteasome (Didcock et al., 1999). Other paramyxovirus V proteins target different components of the IFN signaling pathway. Type II human parainfluenza virus V protein targets STAT2, mumps virus V protein targets both STAT1 and STAT3, and measles virus V protein causes a defect in STAT nuclear accumulation and STAT-inducible transcription (Parisien et al., 2001; Nishio et al., 2002; Palosaari et al., 2003; Ulane et al., 2003). KSHV uses a different mechanism by encoding a homologue of IRF that represses the IFN-mediated transcriptional activation of host genes (Zimring et al., 1998).",

The replication and transcription of viral genomes leads to the formation of dsRNA that activates PKR, which phosphorylates the translation initiation factor 2\u03b1 (eIF-2\u03b1) causing its inactivation and the subsequent arrest of protein synthesis in infected cells (Figure 2). Viral mechanisms that prevent the activation of PKR are varied: (1) proteins encoded by reovirus (\u03c33) and VACV (E3) that bind dsRNA; (2) RNAs encoded by adenovirus (VAI) and HIV (TAR) that bind PKR but do not activate the enzyme; and (3) proteins encoded by herpes simplex virus (HSV) (US11), hepatitis C virus (US5A), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (Tat) that bind directly to PKR and inactivate the enzyme. An alternative strategy to block the PKR pathway is to prevent the phosphorylation of eIF-2\u03b1. Poxviruses encode an eIF-2\u03b1 homologue, the K3 protein in VACV, which functions as a substrate of PKR and prevents phosphorylation of eIF-2\u03b1. The glycoprotein E2 from hepatitis C virus acts as a competitive substrate with eIF-2\u03b1 for PKR binding. Alternatively, the HSV IC34.5 protein activates protein phosphatase 1\u03b1 that removes the phosphate groups from eIF-2\u03b1.",

Four different genes encoding viral TNFRs were subsequently identified in other poxviruses such as CPXV, VACV, and ECTV and were designated CrmB, CrmC, CrmD, and CrmE (Hu et al., 1994; Smith et al., 1996; Loparev et al., 1998; Saraiva and Alcami, 2001; Figures 1 and 3). A variety of TNFRs in poxvirus genomes provide distinct binding properties and may have been optimized to inhibit the immune response in different hosts or tissues (Pontejo et al., 2015). CrmB and CrmD contain a C-terminal domain, named smallpox virus\u2013encoded chemokine receptor domain, that binds chemokines (Alejo et al., 2006). A secreted protein encoded by tanapox virus and yaba-like disease virus that binds TNF but adopts a MHC class I-like fold adds complexity to this family of viral proteins (Brunetti et al., 2003; Yang et al., 2009). Clinical isolates of human cytomegalovirus, but not laboratory strains, encode a membrane TNFR homologue (UL144) related to herpesvirus entry mediator (Smith et al., 1991). UL144 binds B lymphocyte and T lymphocyte attenuator, a natural ligand of herpesvirus entry mediator, and inhibits T cell proliferation (Cheung et al., 2005). In addition, UL144 is a potent activator of NF-\u03baB, upregulates the chemokine CCL22, and may help immune evasion by attracting Th2 and regulatory T cells (Poole et al., 2006).",

The viral IL-18BP is expressed by a variety of poxviruses including M. contagiosum virus, a poxvirus that causes benign skin tumors and persists in the skin for months without inducing an inflammatory response (Xiang and Moss, 1999; Smith et al., 2000). The poxvirus IL-18BP downregulates IFN-\u03b3 production and natural killer cell responses in ECTV-infected mice (Born et al., 2000; Smith et al., 2000). The EBV-encoded colony stimulating factor 1 binding protein has limited sequence similarity to the cellular counterpart and it has been proposed to modulate the response of macrophages during EBV infection (Strockbine et al., 1998).",
