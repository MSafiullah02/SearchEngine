As a result, many of the genes encoding enzymes related to the production of specialized metabolites have been identified. Compounds derived from 2,3-oxidosqualene (the common precursor of sterols, steroids and triterpenoids), a linear compound of 30 carbon atoms produced through the mevalonate pathway, are called triterpenes. These include essential sterols, which are structural components of biomembranes; steroids such as the plant hormones, brassinolides and the toxin in potatoes, solanine; as well as the structurally diverse triterpenoids. Triterpenoids containing one or more sugar moieties attached to triterpenoid aglycones are called triterpenoid saponins. Triterpenoid saponins have been shown to have various medicinal properties, such as anti-inflammatory, anticancerogenic and antiviral effects. This review summarizes the recent progress in gene discovery and elucidates the biochemical functions of biosynthetic enzymes in triterpenoid saponin biosynthesis. Special focus is placed on key players in generating the structural diversity of triterpenoid saponins, cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) and the UDPdependent glycosyltransferases (UGTs). Perspectives on further gene discovery and the use of biosynthetic genes for the microbial production of plant-derived triterpenoid saponins are also discussed.",

P450s are monooxygenases that introduce an oxygen atom into their substrates from molecular oxygen. This process is involved in the biosynthesis of various specialized metabolites in plants. As mentioned above, triterpenoid saponin biosynthesis involves the site-specific oxidization of the cyclized skeleton, primarily through the introduction of hydroxyl, carboxyl or epoxy groups. In plants, P450s form a large gene family. There are around 300 P450 genes in the genomes of flowering plants (Nelson and Werck-Reichhart 2011) . The nomenclature of P450s is based on the homology of their amino acid sequences. If the amino acid sequence homology of a P450 is >40%, it is placed into a given family. If the homology is >55%, it is classified into a given subfamily.",

UGTs catalyze glycosylation using a UDP-sugar donor such as UDPglucose, UDP-galactose, UDP-arabinose, UDP-rhamnose, UDPxylose or UDP-glucuronic acid. Variations in the number of sugar chains, their composition and their position on the triterpene scaffold are thought to have a large impact on intra-/extracellular transport and storage in plants, as well as biological activity, taste and bioabsorbability (Bowles et al. 2005) . Similar to the P450s, UGTs also form a large gene family in plants. For example, there are 115 UGTs in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome, and 242 genes in the Glycine max genome encode UGTs (Yonekura-Sakakibara and Hanada 2011). As with P450s, the nomenclature of UGTs is based on the homology of their amino acid sequences. A sequence homology >40% defines the family, while a homology of >60% defines the subfamily.",

Since then, biochemical functions of 29 triterpenoid biosynthesis-related P450s have been identified. The reactions they catalyze are shown in Fig. 1 .

Soyasaponins are divided into two groups according to their aglycone components. DDMP (2,3-dihydro-2,5-dihydroxy-6-methyl-4H-pyran-4-one) saponins, found in both seed hypocotyls and cotyledons, use soyasapogenol B as a sapogenin. Group A saponins, which are highly concentrated in the seed hypocotyl, use soyasapogenol A as a sapogenin. Soyasapogenol B is biosynthesized by the hydroxylation of C-22 and C-24 in b-amyrin. Soyasapogenol A includes an additional hydroxylation at C-21. In 2006, CYP93E1, which catalyzes the hydroxylation of C-24 in bamyrin, was the first P450 to be identified in relation to triterpenoid saponin biosynthesis (Shibuya et al. 2006) . Soyasapogenol B is a sapogenin common to the Fabaceae and it is therefore expected that CYP93E1 orthologs would be common in plants of the Fabaceae. Medicago truncatula CYP93E2 (Fukushima et al. 2013) , Glycyrrhiza uralensis CYP93E3 (Seki et al. 2008 ) and six additional CYP93E orthologs (CYP93E4-CYP93E9) (Moses et al. 2014b) , which hydroxylate C-24 in b-amyrin, have been identified with a high sequence identity (>80%) to CYP93E1. Oleanane-type saponins, which have a hydroxyl or carboxyl group at the C-24 position, have been discovered in various plants in addition to the Fabaceae. However, P450s of the CYP93E subfamily have yet to be found outside the Fabaceae.",

            "text": "Glycyrrhizin is biosynthesized by a glycosylation reaction following the production of sapogenin glycyrrhetic acid by the oxidation of C-11 and C-30 in b-amyrin. In G. uralensis, CYP88D6 (b-amyrin-11-oxidase; Seki et al. 2008) catalyzes the oxidation at the C-11 position of b-amyrin, thereby converting it to an intermediate product, 11-oxo-b-amyrin. CYP72A154 is a P450 that produces glycyrrhetinic acid by catalyzing the oxidation of C-30 in 11-oxo-b-amyrin . Thus, these data show that the CYP88D and CYP72A subfamilies are involved in the biosynthesis of triterpenoid saponins. In addition, two CYP88D subfamilies of P450 from M. truncatula (CYP88D2 and CYP88D3), Lotus japonicus (CYP88D4 and CYP88D5) and Astragalus sinicus (CYP88D7 and CYP88D8) have been identified, although their enzyme functions have not been elucidated. Like the CYP93Es, the CYP88D subfamily P450s had been found only in members of the Fabaceae family. These results suggest that CYP88Ds evolved specifically in one group of the Fabaceae family. In addition, CYP72A63, CYP72A61v2 and CYP72A68v2 from M. truncatula oxidize C-30, C-22 and C-23 of the oleanane skeleton, respectively , Fukushima et al. 2013 . The CYP72A subfamily is distributed not just among members of the Fabaceae, but across the entire plant kingdom, and an assortment of >200 different molecules has been identified. However, the biosynthetic functions of most of these have not yet been elucidated. Other than the aforementioned Fabaceae CYP72As, only the enzyme function of Catharanthus roseus CYP72A1 (secologanin synthase; Irmler et al. 2000) and CYP72A224 (7-deoxyloganic acid 7-hydroxylase; Salim et al. 2013 , Miettinen et al. 2014 , which are involved in indole alkaloid biosynthesis, has been elucidated.",

The biosynthesis of two major saikosaponins, saikosaponin A and saikosaponin D, includes hydroxylation at C-16 and C-23 of the oleanane skeleton and the formation of an ether linkage between C-13 and C-28. Based on these reactions, CYP716Y1, which catalyzes the hydroxylation of C-16 of b-amyrin, has been identified in Bupleurum falcatum (Moses et al. 2014a) . Saikosaponins D and A have a 16a-hydroxyl and 16b-hydroxyl group, respectively. Note that because CYP716Y1 specifically catalyzes hydroxylation only in the a-configuration, it has been hypothesized that an unknown enzyme catalyzes 16b-hydroxylation.

Likewise, friedelin, a pentacyclic triterpene with a carbonyl group at the C-3 position, is cyclized from 2,3oxidosqualene by friedelin synthase (Wang et al. 2010 ).

At the same time, the development of several large-scale, consortium-based transcriptome analyses has led to the accumulation of massive volumes of sequence data in many non-model plant species. The PhytoMetaSyn project (www.phytometasyn.ca) provides the transcriptome data of 75 non-model plants that produce compounds of interest for biotechnological applications, and the web-based BLAST server allows public access to assembled transcriptome databases for all 75 plant species (Facchini et al. 2012 , Xiao et al. 2013 . The 1KP project aims to obtain transcriptome data from 1,000 plant species with exemplars from all of the major lineages of green plants (Matasci et al. 2014) . The Medicinal Plant Genomics Resource project provides transcriptome and metabolome analyses of 14 medicinal plant species. It is expected that the discovery of new enzyme genes in the biosynthesis of triterpenoid saponins, as well as other types of specialized metabolites, will be further accelerated by candidate gene mining from these data sets. In addition to transcriptome mining, genome mining for potential biosynthetic gene clusters is another standard strategy for gene discovery in plant-specialized metabolic pathways. Clusters of non-homologous genes involved in the biosynthesis of specialized metabolites from several chemical classes have been found in numerous plant species including O. sativa (diterpene phytoalexin), Papaver somniferum (isoquinoline alkaloids) and Solanum tuberosum (steroidal glycoalkaloids). These clusters are described in more detail in Boycheva et al. (2014) . Regarding triterpenoids, (partial) gene clusters comprising an OSC gene and functionally associated P450(s) have been identified for the biosynthesis of avenacin (Avena sativa), desaturated thalian-diol (A. thaliana) and 20-hydroxy-betulinic acid (L. japonicus).",

Recently, Yan et al.

This was accomplished by introducing genes for ginsenoside biosynthetic enzymes, dammarenediol-II synthase (an OSC that produces dammarenediol-II from 2,3-oxidosqualene), CYP716A47 (produces protopanaxadiol via the hydroxylation of C-12 in dammarenediol-II) and UGT71A27 (glucosylation of the C-20 hydroxyl group). Another example by Moses et al.
