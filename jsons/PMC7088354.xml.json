            "text": "During the last two decades, a number acute outbreaks of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, e.g., SARS, MERS, human monkeypox, and recently Ebola virus disease (EVD) [1], have caused many fatalities and much global concern. While the spread of these infections in humans is promoted by global traffic, trading, war, poverty, and a number of soft social factors, they originate basically in a relatively rare transmission of an agent from an infected animal to a human individual. In a susceptible person, the agent can be reproduced to high concentrations of infectious progeny thus fostering a ready human-to-human transfer of a hitherto new infection. The risk of transmission of EDV to health care workers therefore has become a key issue in the last 2 years. Recently, the WHO has published findings of an assessment of risk by the Ebola epidemic to the Pacific island [2], indicating that the possibilty of a spread of EDV to this region may not be excluded. Generally, health care workers (medical and nursing staff, laboratory scientists, health care staff, and volunteer carers of EVD patients in West Africa), have an elevated risk of exposure to Ebola virus [3]. While the role of EDV transmission in the field of dentistry and oral and maxillo-facial surgery seems to be neglectable at first sight, Samaranayake et al. [4] and Galvin et al. [5] have evaluated possible scenarios which would pose a risk to oro-dental health care personnel. The present overview will summarize the updated status of EVD in relation to virology of filoviruses, transmission, clinical symptoms, oral manifestations, treatment, and possible risks for oral and maxillo-facial surgeons traveling to Africa for surgical treatment of facial burns, cleft-lip and palate, or noma.",

The situation soon went out of control. However, for several months, only Medicins sans Frontiers and volunteers from other groups were \u201cin the field.\u201d Only by August 8, 2014, when thousands of new infections were reported with doubling rates of three weeks only, WHO and many collections started efforts to control the spread of the infection. Fortunately, control measures\u2014early laboratory diagnostics, case finding capacities, and strict isolation of suspects\u2014became effective so that presently only less than 10 infections were reported per week from Guinea and Sierra Leone. Due to the relatively late reaction, the 2013 outbreak grew to the hitherto largest with 28,637 reported confirmed and suspected cases resulting in 11,315 deaths until December 6, 2015 [13]. Outside of West Africa, 7 patients with Ebola virus infection were treated in Italy.",

However, whenever health care providers including oral and maxillofacial surgeons give treatment to patients in West or subsaharan Africa an encounter with Ebola has become a reality. Particularly, asymptomatic patients with Ebola virus disease or those with early stage non-specific symptoms may present for dental or surgical treatment. For individuals who may have had contact with Ebola virus, infected patients postponement of non-essential treatment is required for 21 days after possible exposure. This is presently the period of quarantine recommended [15].",
