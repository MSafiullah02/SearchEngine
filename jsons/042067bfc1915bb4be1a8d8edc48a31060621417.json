The impact is more in the vulnerable and the poor, where major environmental risk factors have been demonstrated. Women and children living in LMICs have the highest exposure to household air pollution, especially from indoor biomass fuel combustion. Globally, nearly 3 billion people use biomass fuels such as coal, wood, dung or crop residues for domestic energy production (either cooking, heating or lighting) in homes with no chimney ventilation of smoke [1] .",

It is associated with many health effects, including acute and chronic respiratory and systemic disorders (particularly cardiovascular). The main reasons: the amount of time people (especially women and children) spend indoors, the wide and range of household emission sources, and the increased concentration of some toxic pollutants indoors compared with outdoors. For many pollutants (e.g. biological pollutants, formaldehyde and other volatile organic compounds), the concentration is higher indoors than outdoors. Other important sources of indoor pollutants are tobacco smoke exposure, household cleansers, mold and mildew, burning incense, chemicals from aromatic candles and mosquito coils. However, a limiting factor is that information about indoor pollution is more difficult to collect than outdoor pollution. Pollutant concentrations must be measured separately in different houses, and it has been assumed that observations made over a short space of time (or even on a single occasion) represent habitual exposure.",

First, pregnant women may be exposed to mixtures of pollutants with varying concentrations, timing and duration. New models incorporating measurements from monitoring devices such as the satellite-derived aerosol optical depth spectroradiometry have improved the spatiotemporal accuracy of determining pollution exposure. However, the complexity of multiple pollutants still complicates the ability to model exposures or to attribute outcomes to specific constituents. Second, many host factors including socioeconomic status, maternal stress, and the maternal genome, microbiome and metabolome interact with pollutant exposures and together create the maternal \"exposome\". All these factors impact fetal development. Finally, it is difficult to separate antenatal pollutant exposures from exposures during infancy or childhood to determine the relative impact on lung disease in the child. Alveolar development continues through adolescence and therefore interactions between host factors and the child's exposures to pollutants and ETS may continue to impact lung development, risk for asthma and lower respiratory tract infections. However, this potential for new lung parenchymal growth and lung repair also provides an opportunity to mitigate early injury. virus (RSV) pathogenesis is controversial. In this presentation, we will discuss the interaction between TLR4 and environmental factors in RSV disease and define the immune mediators associated with severe illness. Two independent populations of infants with RSV bronchiolitis revealed that the severity of RSV infection is determined by the TLR4 genotype of the individual and by environmental exposure to LPS. RSV-infected infants with severe disease exhibited a high GATA3/T-bet ratio, which manifested as a high IL-4/IFN-\u03b3 ratio in respiratory secretions. The IL-4/IFN-\u03b3 ratio present in infants with severe RSV is indicative of Th2 polarization.",

Untreated severe asthma comprises children in areas where there is insufficient access to asthma care, and will not be discussed further, since the solution largely lies outside the hands of pediatricians. They should note the dramatic benefits of making simple, low cost treatments widely available; and the developed world needs to remember that for the vast majority of children, simple remedies properly used are all that is needed.",

            "text": "However, it should be noted that there are few if any studies from low and middle income settings of markers for a severe outcome in a setting where adequate treatment is not available. Conventionally, severe therapy resistant asthma (STRA), or treatment-resistant severe asthma is defined as either (a) the need for high dose treatment to control the disease, or (b) either or both of uncontrolled symptoms and acute attacks despite high dose treatment (see Table) after reversible factors have been addressed [2] . The defining level of treatment in children is beclomethasone equivalent 800 mcg/day plus long acting \u03b2-2 agonist and leukotriene receptor antagonist, or at least failed trials of these agents. Persistent airflow limitation (FEV 1> 2 Z-scores below the mean after systemic steroid trial plus short-acting \u03b2-2 agonist, or same level of FEV 1 after withhold of short and long-acting \u03b2-2 agonist However, although those with STRA have bad outcomes, in the UK National Review of Asthma Deaths (NRAD), around 70% of those who died did not meet criteria for 'severe' asthma, despite death being rather a severe outcome. [http://www.respiratoryfutures.org.uk/media/1531/ why-asthma-still-kills-full-report.pdf]! So markers of severity should be considered in all asthmatics. A proposed framework for airway disease comprises airway disease, extra-pulmonary co-morbidity, and lifestyle/ environmental factors, considering clinical traits, treatment (especially what is treatable), and the expected benefits of treatment. I would also add physician behavior, which had significant effects in NRAD. Since we KNOW that most children with asthma are readily treated if low dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are regularly and properly administered, the focus should initially be outside the airway, rather than uncritically adding more and more therapies. The subject has been comprehensively reviewed elsewhere [3] ; this abstract is necessarily selective A. Extrapulmonary Markers of Severity 1. Food allergy: This is commoner than anticipated in children ventilated for asthma in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU), though whether causative or a fellow traveler is unclear [4] . The differentiation of acute asthma from acute anaphylaxis pathologically may be difficult 2. Severe atopy: As with food allergy, it is unclear whether this is causative or a marker of STRA. Either way, children with multiple aeroallergen sensitization with big skin prick test wheals and/or high specific IgE are a high risk group 3. Severe asthma with fungal sensitization (SAFS): There is no generally agreed pediatric definition; pragmatically, ours is STRA (any pattern) with sensitization (SPT or sIgE) to any fungus. Since allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is rarely if ever seen in children with asthma, we do not include in the definition an IgE<1000, as do the adults. We have shown that children with SAFS have worse inflammation for a given level of treatment, thus putting them at greater risk of severe asthma [5] .",

Detection of ICS underuse is more difficult; questionnaires are ineffective in our hands, prescription uptake does not equate to inhalation, and electronic monitoring merely means the device has been activated.

Previous severe asthma attacks: The roots of these mainly lie outside the airway, but it is quite clear that severe attacks are the major risk factor for another severe attack and death from asthma, as well as in the long term being associated with an accelerated decline in lung function. A severe attack should be a 'never event' and should prompt the most detailed re-assessment of asthma management of the child 2. Persistent airway eosinophilia: In adult studies at least this is a marker of risk of acute attacks, and there is certainly biological plausibility that uncontrolled eosinophilic inflammation contributes to severe exacerbations. Whether this is TH2 driven in children is dubious. Neither we [8] nor SARP [9] were able to demonstrate that this was due to the classical TH2 cytokines IL4, IL5. These two studies mean that anti-type 2 monoclonal antibodies should not be used uncritically; we need trials in children, and should not extrapolate from adult studies 3. Absence of airway eosinophilia: We have no add-on therapies for this phenotype, although possibly azithromycin may help; the absence of treatment options makes this a vulnerable group, for which more studies are needed 4. Absence of intra-epithelial neutrophils: Airway neutrophilia in BAL or in the submucosa is not a feature of pediatric STRA. We have recently shown that the presence of intra-epithelial neutrophils is associated with less severe asthma, quite different from what was shown in adults [10] ; pediatric STRA is a different disease TAKE HOME MESSAGE The most important way of reducing poor asthma control and reducing asthma attacks is NOT increasing airway treatment or deploying the latest monoclonal but by getting the basics right, including adherence and environmental exposure, and having an effective management plan for attacks.",

At recruitment, children were classified into 4 categories; mild wheezy bronchitis, moderate wheezy bronchitis, asthma and severe asthma. At successive follow up surveys, severe asthma in childhood was associated with the greatest risk of persistent or frequent asthma in adulthood. Furthermore severe asthma was associated with lower lung function (FEV 1 /FVC) that was established during childhood and, despite no acceleration of the rate of decline of FEV1 during adulthood, this group had a much greater risk of COPD in mid-adult life than subjects who had no history of asthma or wheezing. Similar findings of lung function deficits existing in midchildhood and persisting to adulthood were observed in the Dunedin study in association with wheeze that persisted throughout this transition 3 . The Tucson Children's Respiratory Study was seminal in showing how early childhood phenotypes based on temporal patterns of wheezing related to these asthma and lung function outcomes in later life. This prospectively followed birth cohort showed that most early onset wheeze became asymptomatic in mid-childhood, did not progress to asthma and was associated with low lung function soon after birth. In subsequent follow ups of this birth cohort, the Tucson S40 | CIPP XVI ABSTRACTS group also showed that this transient early wheezing phenotype was associated with persistence of low lung function through adolescence to early adulthood 5, 6 .",

These have since been replicated several times in independent cohorts with evidence of external validity through comparison with phenotypes based on clinical observations. What emerged from this work was that wheezing that began early (within the first 6-18 months after birth) and persisted until midchildhood had the strongest associations with a clinical report of asthma and with low lung function compared with non-wheezers and other more transient phenotypes. Further insight into this was gained from analysis of the Manchester Asthma and Allergy Study (MAAS), which had links to individual health records and showed that the persistent wheezing phenotype could be stratified into those with and without frequent health care utilization; essentially a more severe form of persistent wheeze that was termed persistent troublesome wheeze.",

The jury is still out on whether the other phenotypes that have been identified through latent class analysis and other clustering approaches represent discrete biological entities or different manifestations of the same fundamental process. The next challenge is to extend analyses to include triangulation with detailed clinical and biomarker information to fully understand the endotypes associated with persistent, allergic asthma and to target interventions to these pathways to prevent or modify the long term morbidity of this condition. 350,000 hospitalizations/year for asthma, and approximately 7 deaths/ day from the disease is one of the countries with the highest prevalence of severe asthma in the World (10%). The major challenges in the management of severe asthma in children in these countries are usually the correct diagnosis of this clinical presentation by well-trained professionals, availability, and referral to tertiary centers and difficulty for accessing controller medications with higher costs. Many children with severe asthma are difficult-to-treat (\"problematic asthma\"), and a percentage of these children are resistant to conventional pharmacological therapy (high doses of corticosteroid, long-acting beta-2, and leukotriene receptor antagonists), representing one of the greatest challenges in the clinical management of asthma. This type of severe asthma has been classified as severe therapy-resistant asthma (STRA), strongly associated with the atopic phenotype in children. It is important to emphasize that many patients with problematic asthma do not present STRA, but more often: 1) another disease; 2) inadequate inhalation technique; 3) adherence-to-treatment problems; 4) relevant environmental factors; 5) or comorbidities (allergic rhinitis, obesity, severe gastroesophageal reflux, among others). In LMIC populations, this presentation of the disease still deserves greater understanding and dissemination. Moreover, any child with uncontrolled asthma using high-dose inhaled corticosteroid, long-acting beta-2 agonist (LABA), and anti-leukotriene, deserves to be carefully evaluated, with clinical follow-up of at least 6 months by a specialist in the area, for an adequate diagnosis and management. Hence, due to the complexity of the correct diagnosis of problematic asthma in children, well-trained professionals, with multidisciplinary teams, are essential but are a major constraint in LMIC settings. Regarding pharmacological treatment in children with STRA, steps 4-5 of the GINA guidelines are indicated but are also related to higher cost and difficult-to-access treatments in LMIC, such as anti Ig-E (omalizumab). Omalizumab has shown significant clinical benefits in many children with STRA. However, its high cost is a limitation in these countries. A lower-cost option in this group of children would be the use of daily systemic corticosteroids, but some children do not respond to this treatment and their use is associated with serious adverse events. In conclusion, the burden of severe asthma in children is high, with large social impact in LMIC. A review in guidelines with a closer look and discussion of more effective ways of managing severe asthma in settings with limited economic resources is essential for reducing the burden of disease in children with asthma in LMIC. Asthma is one of the most common chronic disorders in childhood. From the 50's to the 80's, many epidemiological studies have confirmed an increasing trend of asthma which was in parallel of economic development and urbanization (1, 2) . Researchers from around the world have been trying to determine the factors which might be responsible for inducing such trend. The well-known factors associated with asthma were atopy, air pollution and exposure to tobacco smoke, urbanization, dietary changes such as consumption of fruits and vegetables, infections including viral and bacterial cause, personal factors such as low birth weight and born by Caesarean section (3) . To determine the exact mechanisms of how these factors may be responsible for asthma have been a very difficult task. One thing is clear that not one or two of these factors were responsible for the increasing trend of asthma in the Western world.",

Although sensitization was a factor associated with asthma, high rate of sensitization was documented many years before the rise of asthma prevalence. Level of air pollution was very high in many Chinese cities. Yet, the prevalence of S42 | CIPP XVI ABSTRACTS asthma in a highly polluted city of Chongqing was relatively low. Perhaps the most striking contrast was the difference of asthma and allergies between urban and rural environment. Similar rural protection against asthma has been found in Western countries (5) . Exposure to farm animals such as cows and consumption of unpasteurized farm milk were the major factors. In rural China, dairy cows and consumption of farm milk are extremely rare. In our last study of more than 15,000 children from Southern China, exposure to domestic poultry was the most significant factor explaining the rural protection. Furthermore, gene expression studies suggest that there is a marked up-regulation of various immune regulatory genes in the rural population.

In adults, evidence synthesis has shown that the addition of tiotropium to ICS/ LABA reduces exacerbations, while its use as a replacement for LABA leads to heterogeneous results for different outcomes. Results from pediatric trials have been presented and published throughout 2016 and early 2017, leading to recent FDA approval for children 6 years and older, with EMA approval in children still pending (7, 8) . Results suggest that in children and adolescents with moderate and/or severe asthma, use of tiotropium as add-on to ICS, with or without other maintenance therapies, is generally well-tolerated and safe. Lung function parameters generally improve, reflecting its efficacy as a bronchodilator, but not all trial primary endpoints were achieved across age ranges and asthma severity. Further, observed improvements in measures of asthma control were not statistically significant. The place for tiotropium in the management of pediatric asthma is thus still unclear. GINA guidelines suggest its use as add-on therapy for adult or adolescent patients in Steps 4 or 5 with a history of exacerbations (3) . Further data are needed to directly compare the efficacy of tiotropium versus LABA, to identify any predictors (e.g. fixed airway obstruction) to clarify any benefit on outcomes such as exacerbation, and to establish the long-term effects on airway modeling.

However, this is not true for 10-20% of them, this refractory patient population being at increased risk of morbidity and mortality and making up the greater asthma economic costs [1] . Based on cluster analyses, molecular phenotyping, biomarkers and differential responses to therapies, over the last decade there has been an increasing appreciation of the heterogeneity of asthma [1, 2] . Indeed, there is substantial diversity in the clinical and inflammatory features of the disease, with several studies identifying clusters of patients with features corresponding to early-onset atopic/allergic asthma, late onset atopic or non-atopic asthma, exercise induced asthma, paucigranulocytic asthma, asthma associated with obesity, etc. [2] . These various phenotypes are characterized by different types and degrees of inflammatory and immune responses [3] . This approach has also led to the recognition of potential distinct endotypes, such as the type 2 T helper (Th2) lymphocyte-associated early onset allergic endotype, the late onset endotype, the interleukin (IL)-5 associated eosinophilic endotype, the mast cell associated exercise-induced endotype, the late onset obese endotype, the neutrophilic and/or the noninflammatory non-corticosteroid responsive endotype [3] .

In a 10-year review from a large referral center, 228 children and young adults were reported: Cystic fibrosis (CF) represented 65%, congenital heart disease 16%. The remaining 19% were infections (other than CF), neoplasms (2.6%), and other causes (typically classified as idiopathic).",

The definitive diagnosis of bleeding in the lung in the nonhemoptysizing patient is challenging and eventually relies on bronchoscopy, as will be further detailed below. Physical examination is non-specific and ranges from subtle tachypnea, dyspnea, variable crackles and wheezing to pulmonary hypertension or frank respiratory failure. Fever and chest discomfort/ pain are infrequently observed. Laboratory work up beyond the anemia is suggestive but non-specific. Radiographic changes are non-specific and range from minimal infiltrates to massive parenchymal involvement; the feature that can separate hemorrhagic processes from other infiltrates is their fleeting nature. However, in patients with small frequent episodes of bleeding the radiographs may reflect chronic diffuse interstitial involvement and change only minimally with acute recurrence.",

Similarly, in the Boston series, the cause was assumed to be related to an underlying susceptibility to bleed, with von Willebrand Disease (VWD) being ultimately proposed in 3 of the infants. This underlying vulnerability was deemed to underpin the bleeding that would be precipitated by injury to the lungs, by a common environmental cause, possibly a viral infection. However, since no such direct trigger that could unify the cases was identified, no final etiology was identified and no further publications emerged from these series. of successful control of recalcitrant pulmonary bleeding. Our procedures were undertaken as interventions of last resort; in both cases the hemorrhage was visualized during the procedure and its resolution following the treatment was immediate, unequivocal, and definitive. An editorial following our case report (Heslet, 2014) emphasized that the intervention on the air-side of the alveolus constitutes the key advantage of the direct instillation, and advocates for early and liberal use of this intervention for DAH, considering its remarkable ease and efficacy and apparent absent side effects.",

Bacterial co-infections are rarely described in infants with bronchiolitis [1] [2] [3] . With the exception of HRV infection, which peaks in the spring and fall, all the epidemiological reports have shown that, in general, seasonal bronchiolitis epidemics peak between December and March every year [6] . Some other differences in the clinical presentation of bronchiolitis due to the various viruses have been reported. For example, it has been shown that HRV-associated bronchiolitis may result in a shorter hospitalization length than bronchiolitis attributable to RSV and, consistently, that RSV infection seems to cause more severe disease [1] [2] [3] . In addition, one constant characteristic is that infants hospitalized with RSV-induced bronchiolitis have the tendency to be younger than those hospitalized with other viruses [4] . Finally, although differences in the response to medical intervention have not been identified consistently, it has been suggested that infants hospitalized with HRV and RSV may have a distinct response to anti-inflammatory therapy: treatment with systemic corticosteroids seems to be more likely to reduce recurrent wheezing in the infants with RV bronchiolitis, as opposed to those with RSV bronchiolitis [4, 5] . These differences probably reflect the involvement of different pathogenetic mechanisms [5] .",

Most of the information comes from RSV and HRV infections. Besides the direct cytopathic effect, the local host inflammatory response to RSV plays a primary role in the development of the signs and symptoms characterizing the disease. The combined effect of the virus and the inflammatory response to it leads to epithelial damage, sloughing off of the epithelium, mucus production and, ultimately, airway obstruction. Indeed, in infants with severe disease, the cytopathic effect induced by RSV is amplified by the presence of a potent inflammatory reaction, mediated by activate polymorphonuclear leukocytes and natural killer cells. This first innate response is associated with a defective host adaptive immune response, characterized by a Th2-type reaction. This leads to an inefficient g-interferon-mediated stimulation of the CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells that ineffectively clear the virus and poorly stimulate macrophage phagocytic activity to endorse dead cell clearance [5] . The persistent airway hyperreactivity after the \"early-life\" RSV infection may be related, at least in part, to an abnormal neural control of airway smooth muscle tone induced by RSV [7] . The upregulation of nerve growth factor (NGF) and of TrkA and the neurokinin NK 1 receptors functions as promoter of acetylcholine release and as a signaling molecule inducing the production neurokinin A and Substance P [7] . These mediators are involved in the pathogenesis of neurogenic inflammation and in bronchomotor tone dis-regulation [5, 7] . In addition, the persistence of a latent viral infection in sites, such as bone marrow cells, could maintain a constant stimulation of the immune system and explain the respiratory sequelae of RSV-induced bronchiolitis [7] . In contrast with RSV, HRV affects people of all ages and induces minimal, if any, airway cell cytotoxicity [5, 6] . The HRV-induced cytopathic effect on airway structural and inflammatory cells is associated with an inflammatory reaction with the release of mediators leading, in predisposed individuals, to recurrent or persistent bronchial hyperreactivity [5, 6] . A current hypothesis is that HRV infection may be favored by allergic sensitization. The Th2 bias, the characteristic immune responses against allergens in atopic individuals, may modify the host antimicrobial defenses and thus attenuate the ability to fight viral infections via immune deviation [6] . In addition, the release of Th2type cytokines and chemokines could result in an amplification of the inflammatory response to infection, presenting with cold and asthma exacerbations [5, 6] . As compared children with RSV infections, those with HRV infections present more often atopic dermatitis and blood eosinophilia during acute viral infection [5, 6] and causal role for allergic sensitization in favoring more severe HRV-induced illness is supported by the demonstration that allergic sensitization may precede HRVassociated wheezing and may lead to an increased risk of wheezing illness caused by HRV but not RSV [8] . Thus, RSV seems to act as an \"inducer\" of subsequent airway hyperreactivity: its first infection is characterized by extensive airway damage and by induction of neurogenic inflammation, the latter possibly responsible for longlasting bronchial hyperreactivity [5] . In contrast, HRVs seem to act as a \"trigger\", inducing extensive release of pro-inflammatory mediators S58 | CIPP XVI ABSTRACTS leading to recurrent or persistent bronchial hyperreactivity in allergic patients or in individuals predisposed to atopic sensitization [5] .",

A single induced sputum (IS) provided a similar culture yield to 3 gastric lavages, while a sequential second IS specimen increased the yield from culture by approximately 15%. 2 In primary care settings, sputum induction was also effective, increasing the diagnostic yield for PTB by 20%. 3 A meta-analysis reported a pooled sensitivity and specificity for Xpert MTB/RIF on a single IS of 62% and 98% respectively, compared to culture in children with PTB. 4 The performance of Xpert on gastric lavage was similar. Xpert testing of repeated IS specimens provided a higher yield with 2 specimens detecting approximately 75% of children with culture confirmed disease, almost 3 fold that of smear. 5 Xpert is an attractive test to perform on specimens that are less invasive to collect. A South African study reported that Xpert on 2 sequential NPAs was useful for microbiological confirmation in hospitalized children, providing similar sensitivity to repeated Xpert testing of IS. 7 However, NPAs provided a lower yield than IS specimens for culture.",

First, BiPAP may be justified without a sleep study when the child presents episodes of acute respiratory failure triggered by a respiratory infection or an anesthetic procedure, as these events are markers of an insufficient respiratory reserve (19) . Concerning the timing of a sleep study, there is a lack of validated recommendations. This may be partially explained by the heterogeneity of neuromuscular disorders in children (20, (21) . Symptoms suggestive of sleep-disordered breathing cannot be used as predictors or markers of nocturnal hypoventilation as they did not differ between neuromuscular children with or without documented nocturnal hypoventilation (22) . Concerning the predictive value of lung function and other respiratory parameters, a large prospective study in children with neuromuscular disorders did not identify a sensitive and specific daytime lung function or respiratory muscle test that was associated with, or predictive of, nocturnal S70 | CIPP XVI ABSTRACTS hypoxemia or hypercapnia (23) . The type of neuromuscular disorder should thus be taken into account as nocturnal hypoventilation occurs preferentially in disorders characterized by a prominent diaphragmatic weakness. Children with a COL6 myopathy should thus be screened systematically for sleep disordered breathing (24) . Prioritized screening is also recommended for infants or young children with congenital myopathies or rapidly progressive neuromuscular diseases (25) . In children with neuromuscular disease, the documentation of nocturnal hypoventilation by means of a polysomnography is recommended but not essential prior to starting BiPAP because \"isolated\" abnormal nocturnal gas exchange may be sufficient (26) . Indeed, 9 out of 10 patients with neuromuscular disease or thoracic deformity and isolated nocturnal hypercapnia without daytime hypercapnia progressed to overt daytime respiratory failure within a period of 2 years (26) . Moreover, in the presence of an abnormal overnight gas exchange recording or full polysomnography, the criteria that are used to define \"nocturnal hypoventilation\" are highly variable which has practical consequences, as long term NIV indication relies upon hypoventilation detection (27) . The scoring of polysomnography in patients with neuromuscular disease requires a specific expertise.",

Synchronization may be important in delivering effective NIPPV. The device used to deliver NIPPV may be important; however, data are insufficient to support strong conclusions. Synchronized NIPPV may be more effective than NCPAP also for apnea of prematurity. 2 A meta-analysis, regarding apnea of prematurity, suggests that synchronized NIPPV is more efficacious with apnea that is frequent or severe. However, the studies performed addressed short-term outcomes and as such could not address properly the rate of reintubation.

In contrast, the COT study revealed no difference in mortality between the low or high saturation range arms of their study. Given the concerns for increased mortality raised by the SUPPORT and BOOST trials, the current consensus is to titrate therapy for oxyhemoglobin saturations in the low 90's % range to prevent a potential increased risk of infant death. There still remain many clinical uncertainties concerning the diagnosis of BPD and the risk for chronic lung disease. First, the diagnosis of BPD is based on the level of supplemental oxygen and ventilatory support at 36 weeks gestational age. There is currently a debate concerning whether these diagnostic criteria are determined at the optimal gestational age to predict future respiratory disease. Second, although there are much stronger data concerning perinatal factors that increase the risk for BPD, there is still uncertainty concerning which infants will develop chronic lung disease. There is a mandate to continue to follow the infants recruited for the large cohort studies internationally, so that insights can be gained to discover postnatal factors that either confer greater risk or may mitigate severity of future lung disease. Third, BPD is a relatively rare disease with variable phenotypes, therefore large numbers of subjects in multicenter clinical trials are required for definitively testing new therapies to determine whether there is a decrease in BPD or chronic lung disease. This raises the important issue that there is a need to establish BPD endotypes, to better inform therapeutic trials that target specific pathways.",

Placing CTM patients into high and low risk categories may be feasible with an algorithm incorporating radiological features and DICER1 mutation analysis [7] . Radiological features suggestive of uncomplicated CTM include antenatal detection and the presence of a systemic feeding vessel and hyperinflated lung. Features suggestive of PPB included bilateral or multisegment involvement. Although this is a large study (more than 100 patients in each group), this algorithm should be used with caution until prospectively validated in another cohort. CT features overlap between CTM/sequestration and PPB, although the presence of a feeding vessel and hyperinflated lung (CTM/sequestration) and bilateral or multisegment involvement (PPB) have been reported as helpful distinguishing features [8] .

Experimental studies have also shown that although steroids may help to reduce the allergen-induced component of airway inflammation in mice fed a high fat diet and exposed to house dust mite, a second Th2 independent inflammatory component including macrophage markers and type 1 inflammation persisted. 5 An important point to consider when assessing inflammation associated with asthma is the relevance of tissue specific inflammation versus systemic inflammation. The cross-talk between airway structural cells and inflammatory cells is key to determining protective or pathological consequences. 6 This may be of relevance in the context of obese asthma, since evidence suggests the location of eosinophils in different tissues is crucial in determining their effect. When in the lung (specifically the airway wall), they cause inflammation, yet when located in visceral fat, they improve glucose homeostasis. 7 Clinical data that correlate lung tissue eosinophilia with obesity may therefore shed light on the role of eosinophils in obese individuals with asthma and on how to improve treatments in these patients.",

Their use has revolutionized the management of asthma across levels of severities, with marked reductions in morbidity and mortality across ages. While most commonly used drugs from these groups have been commercially available for decades, considerable progress has been made in improving their therapeutic ratio and reducing adverse effects. Rational use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long-acting \u03b22 agonist (LABAs) has been supported by a better understanding of their mechanism of action, enhanced drug delivery and adherence, and accumulating evidence on their efficacy and safety. Gaps in current treatment options remain, however. Recently there has been a resurgence of pharmacological research in this field, fueled by an increased use of double and triple combined therapies, the focus on new therapeutic targets (e.g. cholinergic system), and extensive research on bronchodilation in COPD. A wealth of candidate drugs have entered the asthma pipeline of clinical development, including ultra-LABAs combined with ICS, long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonists (LAMAs) alone or combined, selective glucocorticoid receptor agonists (SEGRAs) and bifunctional drugs. These drugs hold the promise of overcoming some of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic limitations of available molecules. They may also allow to better treat patients with asthma phenotypes that are poorly responsive to current management options, or in whom efficacy comes at the expense of an excessive burden of adverse effects.",

Pediatric Pulmonary Hypertension Treatment The management of pulmonary hypertension has evolved dramatically in the last few years. Many drugs are now approved for adult pulmonary hypertension, but in the pediatric age group, therapy is frequently used off-label, adapted from adult trials. Clinical trials on the pediatric population are under way and their results will be extremely important for the management of children with PH. Conventional Therapy The general management of PH includes the treatment of right ventricular (RV) failure with drugs such as loop diuretics and spironolactone. Diuretics should be used with caution as these patients are preload dependent 4 . Some clinicians use digitalis for improvement of RV function. Severe hypoxemia should be treated with oxygen therapy. The use of anticoagulants is controversial, but it is suggested in children with RV failure and dilation 8 . Physical activity is encouraged, but strenuous exercises should be avoided. Immunization plans should be followed strictly, particularly to avoid of targeted therapies, patients should undergo acute vasodilator testing with inhaled nitric oxide. The test is positive when there is a 20% fall in mean pulmonary artery pressure, an increase or lack of decrease of cardiac output and no change or decrease in the ratio of pulmonary vascular to systemic vascular resistances 4 .

Previously such children would have been referred for heartlung transplantation, but there is shortage of donors of heart-lung blocks, and a relatively poor long term outcome compared with cardiac transplantation alone. As a result, some centers now advocate cardiac transplantation whilst supporting the right heart with a right ventricular mechanical assist device (RVAD) pre and post transplantation.

Another situation where the pulmonologist may be consulted is in children with a failing Fontan circulation.

A systematic approach to classification of DAH in childhood (Susarla & Fan, 2007) separates disorders without pulmonary capillaritis to ones with and without cardiovascular cause. The disorders with pulmonary capillaritis typically carry a more ominous prognosis and include idiopathic pulmonary capillaritis, Granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Goodpasture's syndrome, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, Henoch-Schonlein purpura, IgA nephropathy, polyarteritis nodosa, Behcet syndrome, Cryoglobulinemia, Drug-induced capillaritis, and Idiopathic pulmonary-renal syndrome. Frequently, however, attempts to define etiology fail, and many of the hemorrhagic cases are classified as \"Idiopathic Pulmonary Hemosiderosis\" (IPH). It is important to recognize, however, that IPH is not a veritable diagnosis, and includes variable etiologies that still require better definition. A recent longitudinal French study (Taytard et al, 2013) of 25 children with IPH gave more insight on features of clinical expression and outcomes of these patients. It expanded on the potential role of auto-immunity in disease development. It also contributed to pointing to the relatively large number of such patients who required immunosuppressants after failing the universally used corticosteroids.

Controversies exist about the role of repeated bronchoscopy in defining the degree of the bleeding, however, monitoring via scoring of the status of the bleeding for therapeutic decisions and long-term follow-up was widely used in the AIPHI series from Cleveland. The most widely used scoring system is the Golde Score (Finley et al, 1975) that we have used successfully in our practice.

Unit Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center Jerusalem, Israel Email: Malena@hadassah.org.il There has been a dramatic increase over the last three decades in the total number of non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) species and many of them have clinical significance. This change has been attributed, in part, to improved culturing techniques, coupled with greater disease awareness and a true increase in disease prevalence. These organisms are ubiquitous and are readily recovered from environmental sources such as soil, water, plants and animals. NTM may cause both asymptomatic infection and symptomatic disease in humans. The factors predisposing to infection are likely due to an interaction between host defense mechanisms and the load of clinical exposure. Historically, different classification systems have been proposed, but NTM are most commonly classified by growth rate-either slowly growing or rapidly growing. The most common clinical manifestation of NTM disease is lung disease, but lymphatic, skin/soft tissue, and disseminated disease are also important 1 . The diagnostic criteria of NTM lung disease, according to the official ATS/IDSA statement should include: (1) typical findings on chest radiograph or chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan; (2) \u22653 sputum specimens for acid-fast bacilli analysis; and (3) exclusion of other disorders, such as tuberculosis. Lung disease due to NTM occurs commonly in patients having already structural lung disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis (CF), pneumoconiosis, prior TB, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, esophageal motility disorders and in patients who are awaiting or have undergone lung transplantation 1-3 . The prevalence of NTM isolation from sputum within the CF population is rising due to increasing survival and better NTM recognition. The underlying structural airway disease and altered mucociliary clearance may be predisposing factors. The impact of NTM positivity on the clinical course of CF has been evaluated in several studies but still remains controversial 4-6 .

J. of Pediatrics and CF Center Hadassah University Hospital Jerusalem, Israel Email: ek@mail.huji.ac.il Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, especially in children under 5 years of age. Complications associated with pneumococcal pneumonia include the steadily rose from 14 to 26 per million pediatric hospital admissions in the UK. The prevalence of parapneumonic empyema was shown to increase from 22% in 1994 to 53% in 1999 amongst pneumonia cases caused by S. pneumoniae in eight American hospitals. Of the 50 cases of pleural empyema that occurred from 1988 to 1994 at a pediatric hospital in Cincinnati, 40% of the cases were caused by S. pneumoniae. A study from Jerusalem found that the incidence of empyema and necrotizing pneumonia doubled between the years 2000-2009, almost all the cases were caused by S. pneumoniae. Seventy percent of the cases occurred before the age 5 years. Many authors also reported an increase in pneumoniaassociated lung abscesses and cavitations. The reasons for this increase in the prevalence of suppurating complications in children with pneumonia have not been clearly identified. Suppurating complications were associated with age, recent chicken pox, infection with S. pneumoniae (especially serotype 1), and therapy with antibiotics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) prior to hospital admission. Accumulation of fluid in the pleural space may follow the development of pneumonia in as many as 28% of children. The successful management of such fluid-which may either represent a parapneumonic effusion or be contaminated with micro-organisms, leukocytes, and fibrin to form an empyema, is a crucial component of the overall care of these patients. Controversy exists regarding the appropriate management strategy for empyema or complicated parapneumonic effusion in children. Current options include primary chest tube placement (either open or with radiological guidance) or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) with removal of pleural fluid and exudate. Primary chest tube drainage may be favored by some clinicians because of the perceived advantages of radiographic drainage for localized fluid collections, avoidance of general anesthesia, and the smaller thoracostomy tubes used. However, the fibrinous pleural fluid in the setting of empyema often clogs these small drains, resulting in inadequate drainage. Intrapleural administration of fibrinolytics may augment drainage, although this measure is not helpful in all cases. Open placement may lead to suboptimal placement of the tip of the tube. These shortcomings have led to the use of primary VATS-assisted drainage of the pleural space in pediatric patients with empyema and parapneumonic effusion. A VATS-based approach offers the potential for better lung expansion after removal of pleural debris and exudate, excellent magnified vision, optimization of the location of the chest tube, and reduced chest wall and muscle trauma compared with traditional thoracotomy. Necrotizing pneumonia, also termed massive pulmonary gangrene, is a sequela of pneumonia in which the lung tissue becomes necrotic. Recent attention has focused on S. pneumoniae as the major causative of children with pneumonia is generally based on the age of the patient and the clinical presentation. Initial antibacterial therapy for CAP is usually empirical, as culture and antibacterial sensitivity test results are rarely available at initial diagnosis. Any agent selected for empirical therapy should have good activity against the pathogens commonly associated with CAP, a favorable tolerability profile, and be administered in a simple dosage regimen for good compliance. Because S. pneumoniae is the most common bacterial cause of pneumonia and its associated complications, current guidelines for antibacterial of CAM recommend that the initial treatment will be directed to eradicate this microorganism. Narrow-spectrum antibiotics are advocated in the first instance. Inappropriate use of antibiotics can result in treatment failure and adverse drug reactions, and contribute to emerging pathogen resistance. Consideration of a drug's pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties is also important. Agents with low maximum plasma or tissue concentrations and long half-lives may be more likely to expose bacteria to resistanceselective concentrations. The strategy of administration is also important; low doses of beta-lactams and long treatment duration are risk factors for the carriage of pneumococci non-susceptible to penicillin, whereas short-course, high-dose therapy minimizes this risk. Convenience and tolerability are also essential considerations in pediatrics. For non-severe pneumonia, oral amoxicillin is the antibacterial of choice with low failure rates reported. Randomized controlled trials in children in the developing and in the developed countries showed that, in previously well children, oral amoxicillin and IV benzyl penicillin have equivalent efficacy for the treatment of pneumonia. Both were successful in curing children with CAP.",

Since most pneumococci remain sensitive to high-dose penicillin-based antibacterials, amoxicillin or penicillin remains the antibiotic of choice in pneumococcal pneumonia. The emergence and spread of resistance to commonly used antibiotics has challenged the management of CAP. Multiple sets of CAP guidelines have been published to address the continued changes in this complex disease. Severely ill children are traditionally treated with parenteral antibacterials. It has been shown that penicillin resistant pneumococci were not associated with more severe disease. It has been via the presence of efflux pumps for the antibiotic. It is often associated with penicillin non-susceptibility. Rates of usage and resistance of the newer macrolides have substantially increased over recent times and vary by geographical region. There are reports of treatment failure of pneumococcal disease using macrolides alone; thus, this approach is not recommended. If parenteral therapy is required and pneumococcus is the likely pathogen, benzylpenicillin or an aminopenicillin can be used. Broader-spectrum agents have no additional benefit. For the severely unwell, toxic child with or without effusions, where rarer pathogens are a possibility, or in the rare scenario of high pneumococcal penicillin resistance (mean inhibitory concentration >2 mg/l), therapy should include a third-generation cephalosporin (e.g. ceftriaxone) with a macrolide if atypical agents are potential pathogens, or a penicillinase-resistant beta-lactam (e.g. oxacillin) or vancomycin if Staphylococcus aureus or MRSA infection is likely.However, treating all children with CAM with these antibiotics may change the micrflora of pneumonia causing bacteria and increase the rate of infections with other less common and more resistant microorganisms.",

More than 2700 child years of followup have been accrued with high cohort retention. The population is poor (with the Mbekweni population relatively poorer than that from TC Newman), mostly single mothers and 20% of mothers were HIVinfected. Rates of tobacco smoke exposure were very high, with approximately a third of pregnant women active smokers. 11 At birth, 56% of neonates had cotinine levels indicative of exposure, with 19% having levels of an active smoker. 11 Immunization coverage for the EPI schedule, including 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, given at 6, 14 weeks and 9 months was high. 12 By Feb 2017, there were 965 pneumonia cases [723 (79%) ambulatory and 197 (21%) hospitalized; pneumonia incidence 0.31 episodes per child year; e/ cy]. The highest incidence occurred in children 1-6 months of age. Using a case control analysis, RSV, influenza virus or B. pertussis were most strongly associated with pneumonia; bocavirus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus or CMV were less strongly associated with pneumonia. 13 RSV was the commonest pathogen identified occurring in 24% of cases. However there were several organisms identified at the time of LRTI, with a median of 5 organisms detected on NP swabs. Longitudinal analysis of NP specimens showed high rates of carriage of S. pneumoniae, M. cattarrhalis or S. aureus as well as several potential organism interactions up to 3 months prior to pneumonia. Lung function showed tracking through the first year of life; LRTI in infancy impaired lung function at 1 year of age. 14 The pneumonia case fatality rate was 1%. Conclusion: Pneumonia is common in this cohort despite high rates of immunization. RSV is a predominant pathogen, but several pathogens occur concurrently. Dysbiosis of the NP microbiome precedes the development of pneumonia. Early life LRTI impacts on lung health and reduces lung function in infancy. Early life exposures may predispose to acute LRTI and result in long term chronic disease over the life course. New interventions are needed to prevent early life LRTI and promote long term health.",

A promising strategy under evaluation to prevent severe RSV disease is immunization of pregnant women against the virus. Maternal immunization aims to elicit high levels of protective antibody in pregnant women, fostering transplacentally acquired antibody-mediated protection in infants during the first months of life [6-8].Other interesting approaches to RSV prevention in infants are under study, including but not limited to passive prophylaxis with long-lived monoclonal antibodies against a neutralizing epitope in the RSV fusion (F) protein and immunization with recombinant live attenuated RSV vaccines[9][10].The surge of old and novel approaches to prevent RSV suggests that we may witness a significant change in the landscape of respiratory infections in the near future, if the main cause of infant hospitalization worldwide is tamed. While the burden of RSV disease may decrease, predicting the magnitude of change is premature. Yet, numerous important lessons will emerge from this worldwide effort. First, RSV is responsible for a significant proportion of infant hospitalizations worldwide[1,2]. Second, decreasing its impact may affect other acute and chronic consequences of RSV infection, from secondary bacterial infections and mortality to recurrent wheezing and asthma[2][3][4][5].Finally, RSV prevention may inform about other factors influencing maternal-infant health such as human milk protection and/or the acute and long-term effects of respiratory illness during pregnancy.This presentation intends to address questions that may emerge during or after RSV prevention.",

In most families, the disease is transmitted by an autosomal-recessive pattern of inheritance, though rare instances of autosomal-dominant or X-linked inheritance patterns have been reported. Primary ciliary dyskinesia does not have an apparent racial or gender predilection.Primary ciliary dyskinesia has several characteristic features.Neonatal respiratory distress is a common feature, and most affected newborns develop increased work of breathing, tachypnea, and upper and middle lobe atelectasis on chest radiographs.Often diagnosed with transient tachypnea or neonatal pneumonia, infants frequently require supplemental oxygen flow or ventilator support for days to weeks. Daily, year-round productive (wet) cough that begins in infancy is a common clinical manifestation of primary ciliary dyskinesia.

The number with an underlying disorder is variable (e.g. aspiration, immunodeficiency, primary ciliary dyskinesia, presence of a foreign body) but seen in 52% when 12 studies involving 989 children were combined(7).Available guidelines suggest a range of appropriate investigations which individual history and examination will inform. The most common infecting organism in children is non-typable Haemophilus influenzae, with Streptococcal pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis frequently cultured. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is rare, and in our New Zealand clinic seen only in those with severe disease or with chronic aspiration. The presence of Staphylococcus aureus indicates the need to exclude cystic fibrosis. Bronchiectasis pathogenesis involves complex interactions between host, microbes and the environment. Initial infection with impaired mucociliary clearance and dysregulated inflammation ultimately results in the destruction of airway walls, with mucus retention increasing the susceptibility to further infection and inflammation, resulting in progressive airway damage. Respiratory secretions (BAL, sputum) show a neutrophilic inflammation with high levels of proinflammatory mediators and neutrophil chemoattractant factors. In addition to inflammatory over-stimulation, there is recent suggestion about impaired interferon-gamma response to Haemophilus influenzae and reduced macrophage activity (8).Treatment: Airway clearance with chest physiotherapy and exercise is the mainstay of bronchiectasis management with infective exacerbations treated with a longer than usual course (2 weeks) of antibiotics(1, 2). Prolonged courses of antibiotics, oral azithromycin or nebulized gentamicin for 6 months or more, have shown reduced infections, reduced hospital admissions and improved cough scores, but with the issue of increased bacterial resistance. Importantly, this resistance is seen less with better adherence.A recent Cochrane review on interventions in bronchiectasis indicated a paucity of data on which to base management, and very few trials with children(9). Nebulized hypertonic saline was inconclusive and nebulized RhDNase increased exacerbations and therefore must be avoided. Small, and possibly questionably clinically relevant, responses in lung function, dyspnea, or cough-free days were reported for inhaled corticosteroids alone and with long acting beta agonists with few participants. A single study suggested benefit with nebulized indomethacin. Other anti-inflammatory agents and other nebulized antibiotics (amikacin, ciprofloxacin) are being trialled.

Several observational studies have shown associations between asthma and high intake of omega-6 Long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs), whereas omega-3 LCPUFA have been shown to be anti-inflammatory, as they decrease inflammatory cell production of pro-inflammatory prostaglandin E2, Leukotriene B4 and activity of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-\u03baB).

A Cochrane review 7 concluded that HFNC has similar rates of efficacy to other forms of non-invasive respiratory support in preterm infants for preventing treatment failure, death and chronic lung disease. Most evidence is available for the use of HFNC as post-extubation support. Following extubation, HFNC is associated with less nasal trauma, and may be associated with reduced pneumothorax compared with NCPAP. Yet, more studies, especially in the initial treatment of RDS and in ELBW infants, are needed before adopting HFNC as an alternative mode of NIV in these conditions. Following this Cochrane, in the international HIPSTER multicenter, randomized, noninferiority trial, 8 564 preterm infants (gestational age, \u226528 weeks 0 days) with early respiratory distress who had not received surfactant replacement were assigned to treatment with either HFNC or NCPAP. The primary outcome was treatment failure within 72 hours after randomization. Treatment failure occurred in 71 of 278 infants (25.5%) in the high-flow group and in 38 of 286 infants (13.3%) in the CPAP group (risk difference, 12.3 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.8 to 18.7; P < 0.001). The rate of intubation within 72 hours did not differ significantly between the high-flow and CPAP groups (15.5% and 11.5%, respectively; risk difference, 3.9 percentage points; 95% CI, \u22121.7 to 9.6; P = 0.17), nor did the rate of adverse events. They concluded that when used as primary support for preterm infants with RDS, high-flow therapy resulted in a significantly higher rate of treatment failure than did NCPAP. For post extubation, in very preterm infants, Manley et al. 9 in a multicenter, randomized, noninferiority trial, assigned 303 very preterm infants to receive treatment with either HFNC or NCPAP. The primary outcome was treatment failure within 7 days. The use of HFNC was noninferior to the use of NCPAP, with treatment failure occurring in 52 of 152 infants (34.2%) in the HFNC group and in 39 of 151 infants (25.8%) in the NCPAP group. Almost half the infants in whom treatment with HFNC failed were successfully treated with NCPAP without reintubation.",

Explaining mechanisms are currently London and Royal Brompton & Harefield NHS Trust London, UK Email: j.c.davies@imperial.ac.uk CF is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, an anion channel situated on the apical surface of epithelial cells which controls the flux of chloride, bicarbonate and sodium thereby regulating airway surface hydration. Patients lacking normal CFTR function have impaired mucociliary clearance and are prone to early infection and inflammation in the airways. CFTR is also expressed in the sweat gland where it reabsorbs chloride from sweat; patients with CF thus have raised levels of sweat chloride. The early observation of this fact led to development of the gold-standard diagnostic sweat test. Diagnostic cut-offs are established >60 mmol for CF and <30 mmol for the healthy population, with an 'intermediate' area between 30 and 60 mmol/l 1 . In 1989 the gene responsible for CF was first identified and the common mutation, F508del, described. This is present on at least one allele in 70-85% of CF patients worldwide, with around 40-50% of patients being homozygous. There are now >2,000 mutations described, many of which are extremely rare and have not yet been fully understood. The cftr2 project is aiding progress rapidly in assigning reported CFTR mutations to 'CF-causing', 'not CF-causing' or 'variable clinical consequence' categories (www.cftr2.org). Clinical manifestations of CF include early onset failure to thrive and diarrhea due to pancreatic exocrine dysfunction, respiratory symptoms such as chronic moist cough and bacterial infections, upper airway complications including sinusitis and nasal polyps, liver disease and later complications of diabetes mellitus and arthropathy. \u223c10% of CF babies are born with gut obstruction due to inspissated meconium and the diagnosis may even be suspected prenatally with echogenic bowel.",

Thiocyanate is critical for epithelial generation of hypothiocyanate, an important anti-microbial factor. Loss of both CFTR and apical purinergic-regulated chloride channels results in unopposed epithelial sodium channel activity and airway surface dehydration. The loss of airway surface liquid homeostasis increases mucus viscosity and prevents mucociliary clearance of microbes. In addition to causing aberrant ion and water homeostasis, loss of CFTR is associated with depletion of protective factors in the airway epithelium including i) IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, ii) iNOS, a required factor to upregulate interferon, an anti-viral factor, and iii) glutathione, a major antioxidant. Furthermore, loss of CFTR also affects the balance of pro-and anti-inflammatory lipids resulting in a pro-inflammatory state in the airways. Patients with CF have increased arachidonic acid and decreased docosahexanoic acid compared to healthy control subjects. Arachidonic acid is the precursor for inflammatory lipids such as leukotrienes, thromboxanes and prostaglandins, while docosahexanoic acid is the precursor for antiinflammatory lipids such as lipoxinA4, resolvins, and protectins which blunt neutrophil infiltration. The sphingolipids in the lung are also altered in CF. There is conflicting information concerning the impact of loss of CFTR on ceramide levels in macrophages and in epithelial cells. Either excess or deficient ceramide levels are observed in different Cftr-deficient mice. Importantly, if the homeostasis of ceramide is disturbed in either direction, mice are susceptible to increased inflammation. Furthermore, other sphingolipids such as sphingosine play important roles in response to microbes in the lung. Ceramide affects cell membrane lipid raft composition, receptor clustering and cell signaling. Ceramide also increases epithelial cell permeability and induces apoptosis. In patients with CF, long chain ceramides are increased and sphingosine is decreased in respiratory epithelial cells. Either inhibition of ceramide accumulation or augmentation of sphingosine with the FTY720 sphingosine-1P analog rescued Cftrdeficient mice from P. aeruginosa pneumonia. CF immune cells also have dysregulated pro-inflammatory responses. There is a shift to Th17 differentiation by CF T cells.

To shepherd these drugs through testing to confirm safety and efficacy, there are several challenges to be met. First, it is important to characterize the inflammatory biomarkers to be followed in trials. Although airway biomarkers detected through sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage are the most direct measures of airway inflammation, healthy young subjects do not expectorate and would require sputum induction, and BAL is invasive and not easily accessible for research purposes in children. Therefore identification of circulating inflammatory biomarkers would facilitate determination of anti-inflammatory efficacy in vivo. Second, confirmation of safety is critical early in the process since anti-inflammatory medications may have unpredicted side effects and increase susceptibility to infection. Third, it is important to select the correct population that is likely to respond to therapy-a personalized medicine approach to anti-inflammatory therapy. Just as different classes of CFTR mutations are responsive to specific CFTR corrector/potentiator therapies, it is possible that a patient's \"inflammatory profile\" will be used by clinicians to determine the best choice(s) for anti-inflammatory medication(s).

During the last decades the care for CF patients has become more and more challenging due to both the selection of multi-resistant bacteria, as well as novel techniques identifying the pathogens present in the lungs. Regarding Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), we have established and assessed the long-term success of an eradication scheme introduced in 2002 for all newly colonized patients in our center. After intensive therapy, i.e. iv and oral combinations, MRSA was eradicated in 84% of the patients; those subjects had stable clinical course (mean FEV1 one year before MRSA 80.4%, 3 years after MRSA 81.0%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P ae) was detected in the study by Burns et al.which combined bronchoalveolar lavage and serological results at high rates even in children younger than three years of age, indicating that P. aeruginosa infection occurs very early and may be intermittent or undetectable by culture. Secondary prevention, i.e. interventions after diagnosis of an airway colonization, is now established as a usual approach. Of interest, in the various studies, the success rate depends primarily on the definition of eradication and time points at least 1 or better 2 years after first detection should be used, to get reliable results. We also include the measurement of serum anti-P ae antibodies. A chronic P ae infection necessitates regular suppression therapy with antimicrobials in order to prevent deterioration of lung function. Qvist T et al. identified, in 2016, infections with a significant impact on rate of decline in %FEV1 other than Pseudomonas aeruginosa which alone had a negative impact of \u22120.95% (95% CI \u22121.24 to \u22120.66). Mycobacterium abscessus complex led to a loss of \u22122.22% points per year (95% CI \u22123.21 to \u22121.23), Burkholderia cepacia complex to \u22121.95% (95% CI \u22122.51 to \u22121.39), and Achromobacter xylosoxidans to \u22121.55% (95% CI \u22122.21 to \u22120.90). Common approaches to address these microbacteria will be discussed. In the study of Qvist, clearing M. abscessus complex was associated with a change to a slower decline, similar in magnitude to the pre-infection slope. The multitude of other bacteria in CF airways which can be detected by non-culture based techniques in a given patient, dosages, pharmacodynamics and interactions of drugs applied, comprehensive treatment including airway clearance, upper airway reservoir and implementation into everyday life need to be considered, when treating resistant bacteria in CF. the airways to guarantee effective ventilation is the cornerstone of any resuscitation or management of respiratory failure. Endotracheal intubation is a reliable method providing access into the lungs both for delivery of air/oxygen and management of airway obstruction, such as direct suctioning. Indication of intubation and management of an intubated child is a special challenge in the intensive care setting that requires careful judgment and respecting the physiological needs of children of different age groups. Indications of Intubation in the Neonate and Aspects of Safe Management In the neonates, endotracheal intubation is often needed as an emergency procedure in the delivery room in the case of perinatal complication with respiratory failure. In other situations, endotracheal intubation may be chosen as an elective procedure to secure the airways and provide positive pressure ventilation. This may be the case in congenital defects such as Pierre-Robin sequence, macroglossy, laryngeal cyst, fetal hydrops, diaphragmatic hernia or diaphragmatic paresis. Short endotracheal intubation has been used for surfactant administration in extremely low birth weight babies (INSURE); however, recently, the less invasive surfactant administration (LISA) has been used more often to prevent possible complications of even a short intubation. The most frequent indication for endotracheal intubation is a respiratory failure requiring artificial ventilation. There is a broad spectrum of disorders that may lead to respiratory compromise in a newborn. In premature babies, the incidence of respiratory distress is rather high and often requires positive pressure ventilation with oxygen supplementation. Depending on gestational age and other factors, such as ventilator regime and fraction of oxygen, bronchopulmonary dysplasia of various severity develops and determines the intensity and duration of the respiratory support needed. Other reasons of perinatal respiratory failure may occur either directly associated with respiratory pathology (meconium aspiration, atelectasis, transient tachypnea of a newborn) or as a complication of other non-respiratory pathologies (sepsis, metabolic disorders, congenital heart defects, surgery for other congenital defects or postnatal complications). Current techniques of artificial ventilation based on synchronized and volume guaranteed regimes provide effective support that fully respects the physiological requirements of a newborn and assures adequate oxygenation while reducing the risks associated with positive pressure ventilation. Another critical issue is the choice of an endotracheal tube of appropriate size. of endotracheal intubation is determined by the underlying pathology and the requirement of ventilator support. It is desirable to keep the intubation period as short as possible to reduce risk of possible complications. Too early extubation, however, inevitably carries risk of cardiopulmonary instability and often results in need for reintubation and reinstitution of artificial ventilation. On the other hand, prolonged intubation has been associated with increased risk of airway or lung injury, with increasing incidence of infectious complications, such as ventilator associated pneumonia and neurodevelopmental impairment mainly in extremely low birth weight children. 1 Continuous monitoring and evaluation of respiratory status of each child is therefore mandatory to allow for appropriate timing of extubation. The decision to extubate should be taken after careful evaluation of cardiorespiratory stability, the oxygen requirement and its trend and the overall status of the baby and its readiness for a switch to spontaneous ventilation. Extubation should be always properly planned and prepared. The worst scenario is an unexpected accidental extubation that usually leads to emergency reintubation and carries significant risk of hypoxemia, instability and even airway injury during rapid emergency reintubation. Various protocols for weaning of mechanical ventilation and extubation have been proposed. The unifying concept is to assure effective spontaneous ventilation and to prevent ventilation inhomogeneity and alveolar collapse. First step is reduction of sedation to guarantee unsuppressed central respiratory activity. If the child maintains adequate spontaneous triggering of breathing, the FiO 2 can be reduced together with inspiratory pressure (Pin). The recommended tidal volume that should maintain adequate ventilation and at the same time prevent any lung injury is at the level of 4.5 to 5.5 mL/kg BW. Compliance and resistance of the respiratory tract should also be taken in consideration. Before extubation, the tube should be used for last direct suctioning, if needed. If the monitoring of blood gases and vital signs and functions provides stable results, the child can be extubated and immediately switched to nasal CPAP. Especially in preterm babies with residual lung pathology, the nCPAP pressures should be kept higher (at the level of 7 to 9 cmH 2 O) as this has been shown to be more effective than lower pressures (4 to 6 cmH 2 O). 2 Especially in premature babies, a pharmacological support of the transition with caffeine of methylxanthine is recommended. 3 Corticosteroids may be considered in children with BPD or history of difficult intubation where increased risk of edema in the airways is suspected. While they may improve the rate of successful extubation, the possible risks should be always weighed against the benefit. 3 Nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) has been shown safe and effective for preventing reintubation in preterm children whose response to nCPAP was not sufficient. very early need for reintubation usually signals some anatomical problem with airway obstruction developing after removal of the \"stenting\" tube. It may also be associated with the switch from a positive pressure ventilation to spontaneous breathing and change of pressure gradients in the airways. Such problems are mostly observed in tracheo/bronchomalacia, external compression of the airways or some congenital airway defects. Upper airway or laryngeal pathologies may also lead to quick onset of respiratory problems. It may be helpful to evaluate the airways with an ultrathin bronchoscope after stabilization and reinstitution of adequate ventilation. Careful extubation on the bronchoscope may help to reveal the location of obstruction in many cases; however, this is not 100% reliable. Several rather different time intervals have been used in published studies to define reintubation as extubation failure, therefore the comparison of published results is rather difficult. Mostly used intervals were 48 or 72 hours. From a practical point of view, as failure of extubation, we should understand a need for reintubation in a child with no new pathology that could explain the imminent respiratory failure. Indications for reintubation usually are frequent or major apneas, inability to maintain hemoglobin O 2 saturation above 88% nCPAP or inappropriate response.Failed extubation represents a high risk situation especially in very low birth weight children. It has been associated with high morbidity and even increased risk of death.5  Therefore, various attempts to predict successful extubation have been published, most of them based on scoring some of the physiological signs that characterize respiratory drive and respiratory strength. The simple ratio of dead space to tidal volume (VD/VT) failed to predict risk of extubation failure,6  while tidal volume at the moment of extubation, SpO 2 /FiO 2 ratio, spontaneous breathing test (SBT) before extubation and Silverman-Anderson score starting 1 hours after extubation showed a significant predictive value for the risk of reintubation.7  More sophisticated studies have attempted to characterize the physiology of ventilation as a predictor of extubation failure.

Possible benefits of QVAR could be masked by a tendency towards higher use of additional steroids in the placebo group. Despite the near universal adaptation of gentle mechanical ventilation, surfactant use and non-invasive respiratory support, BPD remains one of the most common respiratory morbidities in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants. A recent meta-analysis 5 reported on the efficacy of intra-tracheal administration of budesonide-surfactant mixture in preventing BPD in these infants. The analysis included only 2 studies and revealed that infants who received intra-tracheal instillation of budesonide-surfactant mixture demonstrated 43% reduction in the risk of BPD (RR: 0.57; 95%CI: 0.43-0.76, NNT = 5). Although mortality was not different between the groups, a 40% reduction was observed in the composite outcome of death or BPD in the budesonidesurfactant group (RR: 0.60; 95%CI: 0.49-0.74, NNT = 3). Thus, this review concludes that intra-tracheal administration of budesonidesurfactant combination was associated with decreased incidence of BPD alone or composite outcome of death or BPD in VLBW infants. However, there is a need for larger trials before this combination of therapies can be recommended as a standard of care. In line with the trend of minimal invasive therapy, Kugelman et al. 6 published a study on the impact of continuous capnography in ventilated neonates: a randomized, multi-center study. Study aim was to compare the time spent within a pre-defined safe range of carbondioxide (30-60 mmHg) during conventional ventilation between infants who were monitored with distal capnography (dETCO 2 ) and those who were not. Infants in the monitored compared with the masked group spent significantly (p = 0.03) less time at unsafe range of dETCO 2 levels (high: 3.8 vs. 8.8% or low: 3.8 vs. 8.9%, respectively). Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) or periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) rate was lower in the monitored group (p = 0.02) and was found to be significantly (p < 0.05) associated with the independent factors: dETCO 2 -monitoring and GA. The rate of BPD was comparable between the groups. The study concluded that continuous dETCO 2monitoring was found to improve the control of carbon-dioxide levels within a safe range during conventional ventilation in the NICU. Bradley et al. 7 reported that nasal high-flow therapy (nHFT) is commonly used for non-invasive respiratory support in the NICU. The study objective was to determine which aspects of neonatal nHFT have achieved adequate evidence base to support consensus among experienced clinical investigators, and to document areas lacking consensus to promote future investigations. Consensus was reached for many aspects of nHFT including: need for adequate heating and humidification, need to prevent nares occlusion, maximum flow rate of 8 L/min, assessment of FiO 2 and work of breathing for either flow escalation or weaning, equivalence of nHFT to nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) for non-invasive support of infants>28 weeks with resolving respiratory distress, and use of nHFT for non-invasive support of stable infants on nCPAP.

Kendig Jr. Professor of Pediatric Pulmonary Medicine, Children's Hospital of Richmond at VCU, Richmond, VA, USA E-mail: judith.voynow@vcuhealth.org Fifty years ago, Northway first described bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). BPD affects approximately 10,000-15,000 preterm infants annually in the US. It is the major cause of chronic lung disease and morbidity for preterm infants. Preterm infants are diagnosed with BPD based on their requirement for supplemental oxygen or ventilator support. The most commonly used criteria are based on a physiological challenge test at 36 weeks post-menstrual age to assess the infant's requirement for supplemental oxygen.The epidemiology and pathology of BPD have changed dramatically over the past 25 years. \"Old\" BPD occurred in preterm infants with surfactant deficiency (<34 weeks) following respiratory distress syndrome (RDS).The introduction of two therapies, antenatal steroids and intratracheal or aerosol surfactant, markedly improved outcomes and survival, shifting the demographics of BPD to earlier preterm infants (< 29 weeks gestational age). The \"new\" BPD, often called chronic lung disease of the newborn or CLD, is characterized by arrested alveolar-capillary development with larger, simplified alveoli, increased interstitial fibrosis, and abnormal pulmonary vasculature with decreased branching and precapillary arteriovenous anastomoses. Other comorbidities associated with BPD include patent ductus arteriosus with increased pulmonary edema, abnormal central respiratory drive with apnea and hypopnea, pulmonary inflammation and injury, and pulmonary hypertension related to hypoxemia and an abnormal pulmonary vasculature. Preterm birth, BPD and respiratory infections result in airflow obstruction that persists into adulthood and predisposes to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Therefore there is a pressing need to determine interventions to prevent BPD and chronic lung disease.Several large multicenter trials have tested therapeutic strategies in the acute postnatal period to reduce the incidence of CLD sequelae.The two major interventions that are safe and effective are caffeine and intramuscular Vitamin A. Although dexamethasone treatment decreases the incidence of BPD, early administration of high dose dexamethasone increases the risk for gastrointestinal perforation, and poor neurocognitive outcomes. These complications have limited its use. In one trial, the DART Study, low dose dexamethasone was used after the second week of life in selected infants who failed extubation and treatment resulted in successful extubation and decreased supplemental oxygen requirement. Combined intratracheal therapy with budesonide and surfactant was superior to surfactant alone in reducing the risk for BPD in preterm infants on mechanical ventilation. In contrast, a trial of late surfactant administered to intubated, mechanically ventilated infants at age 7 to 14 days (TOLSURF) did not decrease the risk of BPD at 36 or 40 weeks. There is no evidence that other postnatal drug therapies including inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), superoxide dismutase, glutathione precursors or cimetidine prevent BPD. Non-pharmacological postnatal strategies to prevent or reduce the severity of CLD include alternative modes of non-invasive ventilation to decrease barotrauma and stretch injury associated with mechanical ventilation, and determination of the optimal range for oxygen administration. Several large multicenter trials compared the efficacy of alternative modes of non-invasive ventilator support. One therapy, synchronized nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (sNIPPV) compared to mechanical ventilation, resulted in decreased BPD in extremely low gestational age infants. Other modes of non-invasive support were considered equivalent to the comparison mode of therapy. For example, nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) was equivalent to intubation, administration of surfactant and mechanical ventilation in risk for subsequent BPD. Further, a study comparing nCPAP and nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation revealed no difference in BPD outcomes. A study from Australia in infants <32 weeks gestation, demonstrated that after extubation, high-flow nasal cannulae (flow rate 5-6 LPM) was noninferior to nCPAP (7 cm water) for infants to maintain ventilation and avoid reintubation. Altogether, the neonatal intensive care for extremely low gestational age infants is to shift to noninvasive ventilatory support such as high flow nasal cannulae and nCPAP as early as possible. If infants require intubation and ventilation, the consensus recommendation is for administration of surfactant. Three large trials, Surfactant, Positive Pressure and Pulse Oximetry Randomized Trial (SUPPORT), Benefits of Oxygen Saturation Targeting (BOOST)-II, and the Canadian Oxygen Trial (COT) evaluated the impact of titrating supplemental oxygen to achieve a lower vs. higher saturation range and the impact of these levels of support on death, BPD, and other comorbidities including neurocognitive outcomes.

It usually arises sporadically, but about 25% of the patients have a direct relative with history of DACW. The etiology is not yet known, however, there are data suggesting the involvement of mechanical forces on the sternum.Conversely, changes in sternal morphology, such as absence of xiphoid or xiphoid bifid, are unlikely the cause because they do not have a higher frequency than the normal population. It is believed that what determines the positioning and rotation of the sternum is the distribution pattern of the ossification centers, which in turn depends on the mechanical forces exerted on the sternum during its is the cartilage overgrowth at the sternum-costal junction, which, by exerting mechanical forces on the sternum body, causes a change in its position.Patients with Pectus Excavatum are usually healthy, but in 10% of cases we may find this deformation as a manifestation of a syndrome. In our series, there are patients with connective tissue syndromes (e.g.Marfan, Ehlers-Danlos, muscular dystrophy, etc.) and neurofibromatosis (e.g. von Recklinghausen's NF1), but other syndromes are described in the international literature.Most patients with Pectus Excavatum referred to Pediatric Surgery are asymptomatic. Usually, the motive that leads patients and family members to seek help is the impact the deformation imposes on their body image. Although many authors report alterations in cardiac function, pulmonary function and limitation in physical exercise, this is not the usual scenario. However, severe depression of the sternum results in a decrease in the sternum-vertebral distance and consequently in a reduction of the internal thoracic volume. In extreme cases, the intra-thoracic space conflict may compromise pulmonary expansion, cause obstruction to the flow of important vessels, and/or trigger arrhythmias by the pressure exerted on the heart. However, the predominance of patients who do not have any physiological impact on the cardiorespiratory system makes routine assessment of pulmonary and cardiac function of all patients with Pectus Excavatum controversial, with a more comprehensive study being reserved for severe cases presenting with symptoms. Children and adolescents with Pectus Excavatum are aware of the physical deformation that makes them different. The psychological and consequently inter-individual impacts are obvious, especially in adolescence. The imaging study to document the dimensions of the chest, evaluation of possible secondary alterations of the spine and intrathoracic organs, and planning of the surgical procedure is considered essential. Computed tomography (CT) is currently the most commonly used imaging test, since it allows a three-dimensional evaluation of bone and cartilage deformation. The characterization and severity of depression can be evaluated by several indices, but Haller's index, used by many clinicians in the therapeutic decision, is the most cited, and is calculated by dividing the sternum-vertebral distance (from the posterior surface of the sternum to the anterior surface of the spine) and the transverse diameter of the thorax. Classically, a Haller index > 3.25 is considered an objective criterion for surgical correction, however experience has shown that other criteria should be taken into account for surgical indication.",

            "text": "Innovative, non-surgical approaches are under development and evaluation, including vacuum bell treatment. Treatment with vacuum bell is a promising alternative in selected cases of Pectus Excavatum, provided that the thorax is flexible, particularly in younger patients with mild to moderate deformation. The vacuum bell is a bell-shaped device that is centered at the deepest depression point in the anterior wall of the chest and exerts negative pressure on it. The effect of elevation of the sternum and ribs is immediate during application of the device. The duration of treatment is related to the age of the patient, severity of the deformation and frequency of use of the device. The application of vacuum bell may lead to the appearance of petechiae or subcutaneous hematoma and is not indicated in the presence of coagulopathies or vasculopathies. For patients with severe Pectus Excavatum, the surgical treatment should be considered, according to patient perception of its self-image and the psychosocial impact that the deformation has on the patient's life. Thus, the surgical correction should only be performed after obtained informed consent from the parents and assent from the adolescents. The ideal age for surgery is the adolescence, because the thoracic structure is still elastic and flexible and, on the other hand, it is close to bone maturity and the end of growth, minimizing the likelihood of recurrence. The two most widely used techniques are modifications of the open procedure described primarily by Mark Ravitch in 1949 and the minimally invasive procedure described by Donald Nuss in 1998. The Ravitch technique has good results, but with not negligible operative morbidity and high recurrence rate, although this varies according to the experience of the group. It is, however, the technique recommended in situations of complex DPAT with combinations of Excavatum and Carinatum, as in cases of Pouter Pigeon morphology, and when there is significant asymmetry or a very extensive defect involving the upper costal cartilages. The minimally invasive (Nuss technique) procedure is done through two 2-cm transverse incisions in the lateral wall of the thorax. Under continuous thoracoscopic visualization, one or two pre-bended personalized prosthesis are introduced behind the sternum and rotated to a convex position that elevates the sternum to the desired position. The prostheses rest on the anterior surface of the ribs where they are stabilized. Currently, it is possible to perform automatic and customized bending of the prosthesis before surgery, through a system that calculates the size and shape of the prosthesis based on the three-dimensional reconstruction of the costal grid of each patient.During the last years, there are cumulative evidence that implantation of 2 prostheses has advantages for cases of severe and extensive depression as well as in older adolescents,",

It has the advantage of not being invasive and not scarring, but it requires the motivation of the patient to comply with the therapeutic scheme of daily and prolonged use (up to 2 years). Braces should be used throughout the day, except periods of physical exercise. The complications are local pain and skin abrasion. The major challenge of conservative treatment is patient compliance, complicated by the implications that the use of braces may have impact on patient social life, especially in adolescents, which implies a frequent follow-up of these patients. Monitoring should be strict providing continuous positive reinforcement. Although one-third of patients do not complete the recommended protocol, in those where it is achieved, the degree of satisfaction is quite good. The routine performance of antenatal fetal anomalies scans on all pregnant women in the last three decades has thrown up many problems, largely the detection of abnormalities when there are no data on the long term significance of the findings, and this is particularly the case for congenital thoracic malformation (CTM, sometimes referred to as congenital pulmonary airway malformation, CPAM). The imaging findings, both antenatally and postnatally, do not relate closely to pathology. There is no doubt that a symptomatic CTM should be resected whatever the age of the patient. However, there is no agreement between centers about the approach to an asymptomatic CTM. Antenatally, interventions such as drainage of large cysts or fetal surgery are reserved for hydropic babies, since most CTMs diminish in size in the last trimester of pregnancy without treatment.",

Consequently, both obesity and OSDB favor cardiovascular complications, especially systemic arterial hypertension. Metabolic Syndrome. Both OSDB and obesity interact to provoke metabolic dysfunction, especially via chronic low-grade systemic inflammation. One current hypothesis states that the gut microbiome is the inflammatory connection between obesity and OSDB. Disrupted sleep and other factors facilitating obesity (e.g., a high-fat diet) would alter the gut microbiome and increase the passage of lipopolysaccharides into the systemic circulation, leading in turn to systemic inflammation. Neurobehavioral Consequences. Both OSDB and obesity lead to neurodevelopmental and behavioral consequences, especially hyperactivity/attention disorder (8) and lower school performance.

A review of pulmonary function studies for former preterm infants performed as infants, school-age children and adults reveal similar trends over time. Airflow obstruction is a common finding across all ages with small airways most affected as evidenced by decreased FEF25-75% predicted and increased ratio of CIPP XVI ABSTRACTS | S83 residual volume:total lung capacity. Adults had decreased airflow on spirometry, and there are reports of emphysema by CT scan and exercise intolerance.

Infection, air leak, bleeding and other complications. A large meta-analysis reported on 41 series published between 1996 and 2008 describing 1070 patients, nearly 80% of whom had an antenatal diagnosis of CTM [1]. 505 reached infancy without surgery of whom only 16 (2.3%) became symptomatic. Complications were significantly less likely after elective surgery, but whether this merely reflected that elective surgery was performed in older, bigger children is unclear. A more recent meta-analysis [2] of studies comparing elective resection with expectant management identified only one prospective and eight retrospective studies. Seventy of 168 (42%) patients underwent elective surgery when asymptomatic, with a 10% surgical complication rate; 63 of 98 (64%) patients managed conservatively developed symptoms with a 32% complication rate, which seems very high and suggests a selection bias. Hence overall there is about a 3% risk of complications such as infection, bleeding and air leak in S86 | CIPP XVI ABSTRACTS childhood, but whether the risk increases with age is not known; certainly the lifetime risk of complications in a baby with an asymptomatic CTM cannot currently be computed. 2. Risk of malignancy: We know that primary intrathoracic malignancy is very rare in childhood, and occurs in association with a CTM, with a risk of around 4%. The largest communitybased series of pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB) showed that there are no reliable radiological features predictive of malignancy [3]. Over the period from 1998 to 2008, in a population of around five million with 1,187,484 live births during the study period, 129 children were diagnosed with a CTM (CPAM), the incidence being one in 12,000, and 74 underwent a resection. The reasons for resection were generally poorly documented. A total of five PPBs were diagnosed during this time period, giving an incidence of one in 250,000 live births. Three were initially diagnosed as a CPAM. Thus the incidence of PPB among apparently benign CTMs is 4%, and worryingly, there was no clinical or radiological feature which distinguished benign from malignant. One of the two patients, both of whom were latepresenting, who had a PPB without a pre-existing lung lesion, died.
