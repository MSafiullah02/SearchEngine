Inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] is a chronic disease which requires elaborate management. Due to the relative low incidence and prevalence of IBD, 2 the limited number of specialists, and the individualised therapeutic approaches in our country, treatment recommendations still depend on the collaborative effort of experts in the high-volume hospitals. Nevertheless, given the severity of COVID-19, patients are adviseded to follow local primary physicians, which may result in unmet medical needs. In addition, most patients with IBD require glucocorticoids, immunomodulators, or biologic agents for a long time, which increases the likelihood of experiencing side effects and compromises the treatment outcome.",

We received 125 effective responses in total. Their demographic features and clinical information are listed in Table 1 . Patients were classified into four levels of severity in previous followup: severe [22, 17.6%], moderate [32, 25.6%], mild [31, 24.8%], and in remission [40, 32.0%].
