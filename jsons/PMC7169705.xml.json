However, in the immunocompromised patient, Aspergillus has emerged as an important cause of morbidity and death.18, 19 The recovery of Aspergillus in respiratory secretions in SCT recipients has been reported to have a positive predictive value as high as 80%\u201090%,20 and most isolates require treatment. We report our observations based on microbiologic data, realizing that any positive Aspergillus\u2010related study would be considered significant in this immunosuppressed cohort until proven otherwise. Our study found 8 positive BAL cultures and 12 positive BAL AspAg. No concordance was observed between the two tests. The only concordance seen was between a positive BAL culture and serum AspAg. The lack of concordance among the various methods to detect Aspergillus was indeed surprising and encourages clinicians to use multiple modalities to identify the presence of Aspergillus species as a cause of pulmonary infiltrates in this vulnerable population.",

            "text": "Our institution is located in the desert southwestern United States, where coccidioidomycosis is endemic. Coccidioidal illness most commonly manifests as a respiratory illness, and thus we evaluated the performance of cocci BAL PCR in SCT recipients. Since SCT recipients routinely receive azole prophylaxis to prevent invasive Candida and mold infections, this practice also likely reduces the incidence of coccidioidomycosis in the cohort. We had 1 BAL sample with isolation of Coccidioides species and a concordant positive BAL PCR. Among 2 additional cocci BAL PCRs, 1 had a concordant positive cocci serologic test. Overall, 4 patients had positive cocci serologic tests, among whom only 1 had a concurrent positive BAL PCR. Immunosuppressed hosts have lower rates of seroconversion after infections, and this fact likely contributed to the low prevalence of positive cocci serologies in this population. Therefore, multiple modalities might be necessary to diagnose coccidioidomycosis in SCT recipients, in similarity with Aspergillus infection.",

We have since eliminated BAL EBV PCR from our BAL ICH bundled order sets. Thus, we considered parainfluenza as the most common \u201creal\u201d viral pathogen isolated in our cohort. Notably, we observed that 11 of 12 BAL parainfluenza isolated between May 2012 and May 2013 were during a local parainfluenza outbreak. The FilmArray Respiratory Panel (FARP; BioFire Diagnostics, Inc, Salt Lake City, UT USA), which assesses the presence of 17 respiratory viruses and 3 atypical bacterial pathogens via PCR, was introduced at our institution at the end of our study period and was not part of our data collection. We are therefore unable to comment on whether a NP FARP or a BAL FARP would have provided additional information in our cohort. Azadeh et al.21 compared the yield of concurrent NP vs BAL FARP at our institution and concluded that if a pathogen is identified by NP FARP, a BAL FARP is unlikely to add new microbiological information. Conversely, a BAL FARP may identify causative respiratory pathogens if performed within 7 days of a negative NP swab. Going forward, it would be interesting to study the utility of NP vs BAL FARP in our SCT population.",

In this series, 174 of 179 cases (97%) had a chest CT within 48 hours of FOB. Chest CT scans may be more sensitive than chest radiographs, and CT is now the standard diagnostic tool in the initial assessment of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and other opportunistic pulmonary infections in SCT recipients.22, 23 This was a retrospective study and thus has its inherent limitations. We did not assess the impact of BAL results on antimicrobial therapy (ie, alteration or initiation), morbidity, or death, because our study was designed only to analyze the microbiologic yield of BAL.
