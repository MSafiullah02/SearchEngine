Much of this may be due to the living conditions of many African Americans, where the close proximity and housing conditions result in a higher likelihood of community spread. 13 Additionally, it is more difficult for African Americans to be tested for COVID-19, and if they are able to receive the test and are tested positive, they are less likely to receive quality care. 24 In the long term, with the availability of vaccines and efficacious therapeutic lines, 25 COVID-19 will likely become endemic, where it will constantly exist amongst minority populations, 26 as is the other case with other historical pandemics. 27 Part of working toward this 'new normal' successfully and living with this novel coronavirus is to use all scientific and research efforts to minimize the number of fatalities. Implicit in this approach is ensuring that there is adequate testing in underserved areas such as AA communities. 28, 29 Screening and services should be comprehensively available regardless of insurance status or ability of the individuals to pay for medical care.

For COVID-19, vulnerable and at-risk populations (i.e. those with comorbidities like asthma, diabetes, serious heart conditions, chronic kidney disease and severe obesity) are at greater risk of negative outcomes.16  Due to many social and economic factors, Blacks are disproportionately affected by a number of these conditions6,17 and are more likely to have poor outcomes if COVID-19 is contracted. This preliminarily study aims to understand the relationship between AA density and other social determinants with COVID-19 prevalence and death rates nationally.An ecological analysis was completed using multivariable linear regression. The three most populous counties of each U.S. state and territory were identified and included in the data analysis, with the exception of Washington, DC which is not considered a state so had only one entry, and California for which four counties and parishes were included (see Appendix A for the full list). This resulted in a final sample size of 152 counties and parishes. Data were analyzed for cases collected between January 22, 2020 and April 12, 2020.
