Posttranslational modification of proteins by ubiquitin plays an essential role in mediating or regulating the virus-triggered PRRs-mediated signaling. Deubiquitination is the reversible process of ubiquitination and its role in regulating PRRs-mediated signaling has recently been explored. In this review, we first summarize the ubiquitination events in PRRs-mediated signaling that is triggered by viral nucleic acid and then focus on host and viral deubiquitinating enzymesmediated regulation of virus-triggered signaling that modulates the activation of IRF3 and NF-\u03baB and subsequent induction of type I IFNs.",

            "text": "Innate immune responses are initiated by the recognition of pathogenassociated molecular patterns (PAMPs) via host pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs). The viral PAMPs include structurally conserved RNA or DNA molecules generated during the infection and replication life cycle of viruses. After binding to the viral PAMPs, PRRs activate downstream adaptors and kinases to trigger a series of signaling cascades that lead to the activation of transcription factors nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and interferon-regulatory factor (IRF) 3/7 and subsequent induction of type I interferons (IFNs) and other cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) [1] . Type I IFNs then activate the JAK-STAT pathway and induce the expression of a large array of antiviral genes, the products of which collaborate to inhibit viral replication, induce apoptosis of infected cells and elicit cellular innate antiviral responses [2] . To date, two groups of PRRs have been identified to recognize viral nucleic acid and activate the induction of type I IFNs. One group is the intracellular membranelocated Toll-like receptors (TLRs: TLR3, TLR7/8, and TLR9) which signal through adaptor proteins TIR domain-containing adaptor inducing interferon-\u03b2 (TRIF) or MyD88 and mainly function in immune cells such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells. The other group is localized in the cytoplasm, including retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) and cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) which recruit adaptor proteins VISA (also known as MAVS, IPS-1, and Cardif ) or MITA (also known as STING) and function in almost all types of cells [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . In addition, a number of cytosol DNA sensors have been identified, including RNA polymerase III, DNA-dependent activator of IRFs (DAI), IFN-inducible protein-16 (IFI16), LSm14A, and DDX41 which might recognize cytosolic DNA in a cell-type and/or ligand-specific manner [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] .",

            "text": "It has been well established that virus-triggered PRRs-mediated activation of NF-\u03baB and IRF3 is critically regulated by various posttranslational modifications. For example, the activation of IRF3 requires phosphorylation by the TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) [24, 25] , whereas the phosphatase protein phosphatase 2A deactivates IRF3 by catalyzing the dephosphorylation of IRF3 [26] . The phosphorylation status of IRF3 determines its dimerization and nuclear translocation. Like phosphorylation, protein ubiquitination is a reversible process and plays an essential role in PRRs-triggered signaling. In resting cells, the NF-\u03baB dimer p65/p50 is sequestered in the cytoplasm by inhibitor of \u03baB (I\u03baB). Upon viral infection, I\u03baB\u03b1 is phosphorylated by I\u03baB kinase (IKK) complex. The E3 ligase \u03b2-TrCP binds to and ubiquitinates phosphorylated I\u03baB\u03b1, leading to the degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 and thereby releasing p65/p50 into the nucleus. NF-\u03baB and dimerized IRF3 bind to the conserved DNA sequences on the promoters of type I IFN genes to initiate their transcriptions.",

About 90 DUBs are encoded by human genome and belong to 5 different families, the ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) (56 members), the ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases (4 members), the ovarian tumor domain protease (OTU) (14 members), the Machado-Joseph disease protein domain protease (4 members), and the Jab1/Pab1/MPN metalloenzyme motif protease (JAMM) (12 members) [27] . The major functions of DUBs fall into three categories. (i) DUBs hydrolyze ubiquitin precursors which are translated as liner multiple ubiquitin chains or liner ubiquitin fused with ribosomal proteins into free ubiquitin molecules. (ii) DUBs recycle ubiquitin molecules that are conjugated to target proteins for degradation through proteasome, lysosome, or autophagosome. (iii) DUBs modulate the ubiquitin conjugation of target proteins and thereby regulate their activities and signaling, which are involved in various biological processes including immune and inflammatory responses, chromatin remodeling and development [28] . Recently, it has been demonstrated that DUBs also play important roles in cellular innate antiviral signaling. In addition to DUBs encoded by the host, viral genomes also encode DUBs (vDUBs) which may interfere with antiviral signaling and facilitate viral replication.",

TLR3 recognizes double-strand RNA (dsRNA) and signals through the adaptor protein TRIF, whereas TLR7/8 and TLR9 detect viral single-strand RNA (ssRNA) and unmethylated CpG DNA, respectively, and initiate signaling transduction through the adaptor protein MyD88. TRIF then recruits TNF receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) and TBK1 for the activation of IRF3 and recruits TRAF6 or receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1) for the activation of NF-\u03baB, while MyD88 recruits interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) 1/4 and TRAF6 to form a complex which further interacts with TAK1 and TBK1 to activate NF-\u03baB and IRF7, respectively [29, 30] . TRIF-and MyD88-mediated signaling involves a series of ubiquitination events, which could serve as both 'positive signals' and 'negative signals'. Triad3A ubiquitinates and promotes degradation of TLR3 and TLR9, but not TLR2 to inhibit TLR3-and TLR9-triggered signaling [31] . Following TLR3 activation, TRAF3 and TRAF6 catalyze self-ubiquitination and/or undergo ubiquitination by the E3 ligases cIAP1 and cIAP2 and thereby promote activation of IRF3 and NF-\u03baB [32] . Pellino1 promotes K63-linked polyubiquitination of RIP1 and thus selectively facilitates TLR3mediated activation of NF-\u03baB and induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines [33] . In contrast, the E3 ligases WWP2, TRIM38, and Nrdp1 catalyze K48-linked ubiquitination and induce the proteasome-dependent degradation of TRIF and MyD88, respectively, turning down TLR-mediated signaling [34] [35] [36] .",

These TRAFs promote ubiquitination that is critical for the recruitment of NF-\u03baB essential modulator (NEMO), leading to the activation of the kinases TBK1 and IKK complex after viral infection. Triad3A and UbL-UBA domain-containing protein RAD23A induce K48-linked ubiquitination of TRAF3 and TRAF2, respectively, and inhibit RLRs-mediated signaling [62, 63] . The E3 ligases Nrdp1 and MIB2 (mindbomb E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 2) promote K63-inked ubiquitination of TBK1 and thereby activate IRF3, whereas TRIP and DTX4 inhibit IRF3 activation by mediating K48-linked ubiquitination and degradation of TBK1 [36, [64] [65] [66] . The linear ubiquitin assembly complex (LUBAC, consisting of E3s HOIP and HOIL and the accessory protein SHARPIN) inhibits virus-triggered activation of IRF3 through two different mechanisms. (i) LUBAC catalyzes linear ubiquitination of NEMO which leads to the recruitment of TRAF3 and disruption of VISA-TRAF3 interaction [67] . (ii) LUBAC promotes ubiquitination and degradation of TRIM25 which impairs RIG-I activation [68] . FOXO1 and two E3s RBCK1 and RAUL have been reported to catalyze K48-linked ubiquitination and degradation of IRF3, thereby inhibiting IRF3-dependent type I IFN induction [69] [70] [71] . Interestingly, Zheng et al. [72] have reported that ubiquitination of IRF3 is required for its nuclear translocation, although the E3s that mediate the process remain to be characterized.",

However, it is generally accepted that cGAS is a 'universal' sensor that functions in most types of cells and recognizes different types of dsDNA. Upon binding to dsDNA, cGAS catalyzes GTP and ATP into cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) [73] . cGAMP binds to the adaptor protein, mediator of IFN regulatory transcription factor 3 activation (MITA, also known as STING and ERIS) and induces oligomerization/dimerization and activation of MITA [74] . MITA then recruits TRAF3, TBK1, and TRAF6 to activate IRF3 and NF-\u03baB [16] . TRIM56 and TRIM32 catalyze K63-linked ubiquitination of MITA, whereas RNF5 catalyzes K48-linked ubiquitination and degradation of MITA [75] [76] [77] . Recently, we have identified an E3 ring finger protein 26 (RNF26) that promotes K11-linked ubiquitination of MITA which competitively inhibits RNF5-mediated K48-linked ubiquitination of MITA, thereby promoting the protein stability of MITA and efficient type I IFN induction after viral infection [78] . Whether and how other types of ubiquitin linkage are targeted to MITA, and the functions of ubiquitination are of great interest ( Table 1) .",

The deubiquitination of RIG-I is also very complicated and at least six DUBs have been reported to deubiquitinate RIG-I. It has been reported that cylindromatosis (CYLD) deubiquitinates K63-linked polyubiquitin chains from RIG-I and inhibits virus-triggered activation of IRF3 and NF-\u03baB [80] . We have demonstrated that knockdown of USP17 potentiated the ubiquitination of RIG-I and MDA5 and inhibited virus-triggered induction of type I IFNs, indicating that USP17 positively regulates type I IFN response by modulating ubiquitination status of RLRs [81] . However, the linkage of polyubiquitin chains targeting to RLRs remains to be determined. USP15 deubiquitinates LUBACmediated K48-linked ubiquitination of TRIM25 and promotes the protein stability of TRIM25, there by promoting K63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I and potentiating virus-triggered expression of type I IFN genes [82] . USP4 deubiquitinates and stabilizes RIG-I to promote type I IFN induction after viral infection [83] . In addition, two DUBs USP3 and USP21 have been reported to remove the K63-linked polyubiquitin chains from RIG-I and inhibit virus-triggered signaling [84, 85] . Future studies are required to determine whether these DUBs function redundantly in cellular innate antiviral responses.",

Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) open reading frame 64 (ORF64) contains DUB activity and mediates deubiquitination of RIG-I to promote persistent infection [87] . The leader proteinase (L pro ) of foot-and-mouth disease virus is similar to human USP14 and removes K63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I [88] .

On the contrary, human bocavirus VP2 deubiquitinates RNF125-mediated K48-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I, promotes the stability of RIG-I and upregulates IFN\u03b2 induction [90] . However, these in vitro studies have been performed in an over-expression system or with purified proteins. Further investigations with recombinant viruses with inactive vDUBs are required to confirm the function of the vDUBs in regulating RLR-mediated signaling in vivo. Nonetheless, it is expected that the vDUBs are ideal targets for the treatment of viral infection-related diseases in the future.",

USP3 and USP4 remove the active or inactive ubiquitin modification from RIG-I, respectively. It is conceivable that removing the active form of polyubiquitin chains from the target is to avoid excessive harmful immune response to the host. However, it remains enigmatic why ubiquitination-mediated inactivation (or throwaway) determined by the host could be rescued by host-encoded DUBs. A simplest explanation for this is that recycling a protein is more economical than re-synthesizing it. In addition, sufficient antiviral protein in the cell could equip the host to defense against a second-round infection more efficiently. Collectively, the DUBs work as a sentinel to 'check and balance' all the time and keep the cellular antiviral responses in check.",

There is much crosstalk between these modifications in virus-triggered type I IFN signaling. Phosphorylation-dependent degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 and the inhibition of ubiquitination of IRF3 by sumoylation are two examples [99] . It has been demonstrated that RIG-I and MDA5 could be sumoylated and ISGylated and whether the sumoylation or ISGylation correlates with the ubiquitination is unclear [100] [101] [102] . Undoubtedly, further investigations are required to systemically characterize the role of DUBs in the innate antiviral responses.",
