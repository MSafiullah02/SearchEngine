The patient spent 2 days at the community hospital, which was known to harbor reported cases of MERS-CoV infections. He was later transferred to King Khalid University Hospital on January 27, 2015, where he was found to have triple-vessel coronary disease and was scheduled for urgent CABG. The patient had no respiratory symptoms, fever, or other signs of infection. His preoperative chest roentgenogram was clear. He underwent uncomplicated CABG and was transferred to the cardiac ward on the second postoperative day. On the fifth postoperative day, the patient started to experience fever, with respiratory failure and infiltrations seen on his chest roentgenogram. He quickly progressed to respiratory arrest on day 6 and required intubation and intensive care admission. The screening for MERS-CoV from nasopharyngeal swaps was positive. This was the first confirmed MERS-CoV infection at our hospital. He died 30 days later of sepsis and multiorgan failure.",

            "text": "MERS-CoV represents a big challenge for the health care system in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. According to the World Health Organization, Saudi Arabia has the highest reported number of laboratory-confirmed infections (1,496 confirmed cases), with a case fatality rate of 41.6% [3]. Serologic features point toward a zoonotic transmission from an animal reservoir to humans (Fig 2\n) [4]. Mounting evidence has identified dromedary (single-humped) camels as the natural host of MERS-CoV [5]. Although the route for camel-to-human transmission is not clear, human-to-human transmission through respiratory droplets, especially in hospital settings, has accounted for the majority of infections. The global case-fatality rate is estimated to be about 36%, with most fatalities occurring in elderly male patients with diabetes, heart and lung disease [5]. Like the initial severe acute respiratory syndrome-COV outbreaks in 2003 to 2004, the MERS-CoV nosocomial spread is primarily the result of the initial novelty of the virus and inadequate compliance with basic infection control protocols. This series strongly highlights the susceptibility of patients who undergo cardiac surgical procedures in a MERS-CoV outbreak situation. All patients were admitted into the same ward, and 5 of them shared a common room with other patients who were either incubating the virus (incubation time is 2\u201314 days) or had just started to exhibit respiratory symptoms. Most infected patients started to exhibit symptoms of fever, cough, and shortness of breath by the fifth day after operation. To date, treatment is largely supportive, with prudent initiation of protocols to prevent further spread of this highly contagious infection. This series was part of a hospital-wide outbreak that started in the cardiac surgery ward and spread to other departments in the hospital. Two additional patients died who were not in direct contact with the cardiac surgery ward or its staff.",

Immediate actions included implementing a hospital-wide lockdown, screening health care staff who had contact with the infected patients, and establishing negative-pressure isolation rooms for infected patients or those suspected of being infected. For patients who need urgent CABG after exposure to MERS-CoV or show any symptoms of respiratory illness, percutaneous coronary intervention or postponing the operation should be considered. Permanent actions included ongoing health-care staff education on infection prevention measures, implementation of a respiratory illness scoring tool (Appendix) used for screening all patients admitted for urgent cardiac procedures, and establishing a cardiac stepdown unit as an intermediate-stay unit after intensive care discharge. This added to our better understanding of the pathogenesis of the MERS-CoV virus, and continued international collaborations have effectively halted further outbreaks since March 2015 until now.",
