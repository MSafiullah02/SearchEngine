This paper sheds light on the position of Bangladesh in relation to its South Asian neighbors India and Pakistan with respect to testing capacity and ability to detect cases with increased testing. It also analyzes recent data on case counts and testing numbers in Bangladesh, to provide an idea regarding the number of extra tests needed to detect a substantial number of cases within a short period of time.",

Testing leads to quick identification of cases and immediate isolation as well as treatment to prevent further spread. Once cases are identified, contact tracing may be performed to identify exposed individuals so that they too can be quickly isolated and treated if symptoms arise (Hellewell et. al., 2020) . Thus, more and more testing helps to curb the spread and to flatten the curve and take the pressure off the health care system (Ravelo, 2020) . In the case of South Korea, where there was high testing coverage, experts believe that testing played a major role in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. The key to their success was a large, well-organized testing program combined with extensive efforts to isolate infected people and trace and quarantine their contacts. By 16th of March, South Korea had tested more than 270,000 people, many of whom were tested at a network of dozens of drive-through testing stations. This strategy, which has since been followed elsewhere, eased access to testing and prevented 2 .

Basic statistical tools for exploratory data analysis have been used. against number of days since the first 100 cases was identified in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan. The time series for Bangladesh is shorter than that for India and Pakistan because the first 100 cases were recorded earlier in the latter two countries. The three curves corresponding to the three countries demonstrate exponential increases in the number of daily infections. During the first 11 days, Bangladesh had nearly the same number of infections per day as Pakistan. Both countries exceeded the daily number of infections recorded in India. However after the 12th day, the number of daily infections recorded in Bangladesh began to rise above that of India and Pakistan. Although India had a lower number of daily case counts initially during the outbreak, the numbers began to climb after the 16th day overtaking Pakistan and Bangladesh after the 22nd and 26th days, respectively. The rapid increase in the slope of the curve for India relative to Pakistan during the later stages of the outbreak suggests that COVID-19 may be spreading more quickly in India. However, one must keep in mind that this graph does not take into account differences in the numbers of tests performed in the three countries.",

The positive association between testing and the number of reported cases suggests that more cases will be identified and subsequently isolated with an increase in the number of tests performed. This is in turn will have the effect of slowing down the spread of the virus throughout the population. The objective of this paper has been to assess whether the current level of testing in Bangladesh is sufficient to curb the spread of the virus and to draw comparisons with two important South Asian countries, namely, India and Pakistan.

Plots of number of cases per 100 tests against time revealed that Bangladesh had higher numbers of reported cases compared to India on average. However, Pakistan had higher values for this ratio on several occasions compared to Bangladesh including one occasion where the ratio was seven folds higher. The consistently lower levels of reported cases per 100 tests over time indicate that India may have been more successful in controlling the spread of the virus compared to Bangladesh and Pakistan.",

In spite of this achievement, Bangladesh has observed higher numbers of reported cases per 100 tests than India, which seems to indicate that in addition to increased testing, other factors, such as, effective enforcement of social distancing and efficient contact tracing may also be important in curbing the spread of the disease.",

This has been observed for India as well although with slightly less consistency. For Pakistan, the correlation has not been as strong as for Bangladesh and India. In spite of outperforming India and Pakistan with respect to per capita testing levels, Bangladesh needs to go for rapid testing expansion, such as 30-50% growth or even doubling of the current figure in next few days to detect more cases. This, in effect, would help to curb the spread of the disease through greater contact tracing and isolation.",

Prior to this time, the country detected its first three coronavirus cases on 8 March 2020 confirmed by the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (Institute of Epidemiology and Disease Control and Research, 2020). The country detected three more cases of COVID-19 on March 16 taking the total number of infected persons to 8 (Khan & Hossain, 2020b). On March 18 the country witnessed its first COVID-19 death. Since then, the number of new infections continued to rise as Bangladesh ramped up the number of tests performed. By 5th of May, 93,405 tests had been performed as the disease spread to 63 of the 64 districts and the country counted 10229 cases and a death toll of 183 persons (Institute of Epidemiology and Disease Control and Research, 2020),",

Heterogeneity has been observed in testing capacity both within and between countries due to differences in factors such as financial resources, laboratory capacity and availability of qualified technicians. Healthcare systems in low and middle income countries such as Bangladesh have faced the greateat challenges in expanding their testing capacity due to limited resources.Although there have been a number of research works on COVID-19 in Bangladesh, very few have focussed on testing. For instance, Khan & Hossain (2020a) analyzed global data and concluded that cumulative number of tests is not an important variable to predict the number of infections. Other studies on COVID-19 in Bangladesh include (Khan et al., 2020), (M. M. Islam et al., 2020), (Paul et al., 2020), (Mamun & Gri?th, 2020), (Shahidul et al., 2020), (Anwar et al., 2020), (M. D. Islam & Ayesha, 2020), (M. Islam et al., 2020). As of May 5, Bangladesh performed 567 tests per million people, while its South Asian neighbors India and Pakistan performed 864 and 1007 tests per million, respectively over the same period. A question that arises is , 'Has Bangladesh conducted an adequate number of tests to restrict the spread of COVID-19?' In a country where majority of the people are poor and uneducated, enforcing social distancing measures can be challenging. Thus, adequate testing is required to identify and isolate cases to curb the spread of the disease, especially among the poor masses. This article attempts to answer the question of adequate testing by analyzing COVID-19 related data on Bangladesh uptil May 2, 2020 and evaluating the country's position in relation to India and Pakistan.",

But when the number of tests are adjusted by the country's population, then Bangladesh outperforms India and Pakistan as shown in Figure (3). Is the current level of daily tests enough to slow down the spread? To search for an answer, we analysed the data in a way that provides some idea regarding the increment in the daily growth of tests needed to slow down the spread of the virus in Bangladesh.",

The last four columns show the extra number of tests required and the resulting added number of infections, if testing were increased by 8.8%, which is the minimum requirement, and 20%.
