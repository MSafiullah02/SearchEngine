As with the American epidemic of chikungunya (first cases in San Martin, Lesser Antilles, December 2013), the invasive lineage is Asian.5 The spacing between the start of the 2 American pandemics of zika and chikungunya fevers only represents a 17-month lapse. There is no evidence for the existence of mechanisms of synergy between the two virus, neither at host nor at vector level. Chances are that the human and commercial traffic between emerging countries of the Western Pacific and South America have entered virus and vector just as it happened in Europe (chikungunya epidemic transmitted by A. albopictus, Italy, 2007).6\n",

At the time they were controlled thanks to improved surveillance of persons and commercial goods\u2013inspections, quarantines\u2013as well as through the implementation of measures against the Aedes aegypti (A. aegypti) vector, which, at that time, was common in Western Europe.11 It was not until much later that the massive use of attenuated virus vaccine sent the disease back to its original animal reservoir.

Guillain\u2013Barre syndrome is primarily responsible for the mortality attributable to ZIKV. The exact mechanism that triggers paralysis is unknown, but epidemiological data that relate to the outbreak of ZIKV are consistent in at least 4 countries (Brazil, Salvador, Colombia and French Polynesia). We would therefore face a similar behaviour to that described in connection with West Nile virus infection, its close relative. We can conclude, therefore, that travellers affected by polyneuropathy with flaccid postinfectious paralysis or other neurological disorders travelling from the Holarctic ecosystem (North America, Europe, Siberia, China and Japan) West Nile should be suspected, in patients travelling from the neotropical ecosystem (Center and South America) Zika should be suspected, and if the patient has not travelled, the possibility of infection by an autochthonous Toscana Bunyavirus\n27, 28 will need to be considered.",

In addition, a strict ultrasonographic monitoring of pregnant women travelling from these areas should be performed plus the screening of all those who relate a history of fever either during their stay or up to 30 days following their return to Europe would be indicated. 70% of ZIKV infection cases are asymptomatic and, therefore, there are arguments in favour of universal screening of healthy pregnant women travelling from risk countries. However, the foetal risk associated with these sub-clinical infections is unknown, therefore, compliance with the usual gynaecological ultrasound controls is, so far, the cornerstone for proper control of the occurrence of foetal malformations. Although the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention issued opinions initially against screening of asymptomatic pregnant women, in just two weeks it went on to recommend the opposite, which seems to be the established recommendation in Europe.32, 33, 34\n",

In warm periods the risk will be marked by population growth, besides the outstanding anthropophilia of this mosquito.41 Epidemiologists should coordinate local actions aimed at maintaining environmental health and eliminating breeding sites; this is the basis. Healthcare professionals should strive to understand the disease and incorporate it in their schemes in order to identify suspected cases as early as possible, and monitor and recommend that such patients take anti-vector measures, while awaiting definitive diagnostic confirmation with diagnostic tests that microbiologists will need to assess, acquire and validate. These techniques should be also appropriate to potentially conduct large-scale screening programmes in healthy pregnant women.
