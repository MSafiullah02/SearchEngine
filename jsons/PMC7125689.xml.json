            "text": "Macao, a special administrative region in the People\u2019s Republic of China, has experienced a phenomenal economic growth since the liberalization of the gaming industry in 2002. According to the statistics provided by the Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau of Macao, gross revenue from Macao\u2019s casinos amounted to US$13.6 billion in 2008, representing an increase of 31% on year-to-year basis [1]. This figure exceeded the gross income of US$6.12 billion from Las Vegas Strip\u2019s casinos as reported by the Nevada Gaming Commission by a very wide margin. The direct taxes from gaming amounted to US$4.9 billion in 2008, representing 77% of the total income of the Government of Macao SAR. Besides, the annualized gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in Macao was estimated as US$39,036 at the end of 2008, higher than that of Hong Kong and Singapore. As the majority of Macao GDP (62.25%) depends on the gaming and the associated hospitality services provided to visitors, the change in GDP is a good proxy for economic growth in Macao \u2013 the world gaming center. In fact, many Asian cities including Singapore and Penghu of Taiwan have decided or proposed to jump on the bandwagon. However, this type of service industry, like the manufacturing sector, consumes a substantial amount of electricity to operate and brighten its infrastructure such as casinos, hotels, resorts, and meeting, exhibition and convention venues day and night. To cope with the increasing demand of electricity consumption, public policy makers in those cities need to have a better understanding on the relationships between economic activities, electricity consumption, and economic growth.",

            "text": "Numerous studies have been conducted to examine the relationship between electricity consumption and various economic indicators in the past fifty years. In the 1950s, Houthakker [2] analyzed electricity demand on domestic two-part tariffs for 42 provincial towns in the U.K. He found that average annual electricity consumption per consumer was a function of the average income per household, marginal price of elasticity and marginal price of competing forms of energy, such as gas. Houthakker also reported that the monthly electricity consumption of families had a strong seasonal variation, depending on average temperature and average hours of daylight per day for each month. Foss [3] studied the utilization of capital equipment and suggested that electricity consumption was an indicator of capital usage, especially in an industrial country such as the USA. Foss\u2019s idea was adopted by Jorgensen and Griliches [4] and Heathfield [5] to measure capital usage using electricity consumption data. Mount et al. [6] analyzed both the short-run and long-run demand for electricity for three classes of consumers, namely residential, commercial and industrial. They demonstrated that long-run electricity demand was generally price elastic and became increasingly elastic as prices rose. In contrast, demand was general inelastic with respect to income, especially for residential and industrial classes that approached zero as income increased. Population exhibited approximately unit elasticity for all classes implying the common practice of estimating demand models on a per capita basis to be reasonable. In the past decade, researchers [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12] studied the modeling of electricity consumption in different countries or cities. When annual data were used, researchers [8], [10] found that gross national product (GNP) or its derivative such as the number of tourists in a tourist center was the major determinant of electricity consumption. When monthly data were used, researchers found that population (POP), temperature (TEMP) and other economic or industrial factors are the major determinants of electricity consumption [7], [9], [11], [12]. Moreover, Pao [11] reported that economic indicators such as gross domestic product (GDP) and consumer price index (CPI) have a very weak instantaneous effect on Taiwan\u2019s electricity consumption. Lai et al. [12] used multiple regression, artificial neural work (ANN), and wavelet-ANN to model electricity consumption in Macao for the period of January 2000\u2013December 2006. The results show that the total monthly electricity consumption depends on economic factors such as the number of visitors and their hotel-room occupancy rate, demographic and climatic conditions in Macao. Most of the more recent studies show electricity consumption to be strongly associated with the business activities of a country or city.",

            "text": "In pioneering the study of causal relationship between energy consumption and economic growth, Kraft and Kraft [13] used annual data on gross energy inputs and GNP between 1947 and 1974 in the USA and utilized the test for unidirectional causality as outlined by Sims [14]. They found the evidence of a unidirectional causality running from GNP to energy consumption. Yu and Hwang [15] reexamined the causality between energy consumption and GNP over the time period of 1947\u20131979 using annual data. However, they did not find any evidence to support any causality between energy consumption and GNP over the entire sample period. When the time period was changed to 1973\u20131981 and quarterly data were used, Yu and Hwang [15] reported that unidirectional causality ran from GNP to energy consumption. A year later, Yu and Choi [16] studied the causal relationship between energy consumption and GNP using Sims and Granger causality tests for five countries. They reported that there was (i) no causal relationship between energy consumption and GNP in the USA, UK and Poland; (ii) unidirectional causality from GNP to energy consumption in South Korea; and (iii) unidirectional causality from energy consumption to GNP in the Philippines. Nachane et al. [17] used Engle\u2013Granger co-integration approach [18] to test the energy\u2013GDP relationship over the time period 1950\u201351 to 1984\u201385 for 16 countries. They reported that there was long-run relationship between energy consumption and GDP for 11 developing countries and 5 developed countries. Since then, many researchers [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34] adopted Engle\u2013Granger co-integration approach or its modified version to study the causal relationship between energy consumption or electricity consumption and economic growth such as GDP or GNP. Table 1\nsummarizes the empirical findings of the causality tests between energy consumption and economic growth over the past three decades. The results from more recent studies [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34] showed that there was in general a relationship between energy consumption and economic growth. More specifically, Chontanawat et al. [32] suggested that causality from energy to GDP was found to be more prevalent in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries compared to the developing non-OECD countries. However, when it comes to whether the increase in energy consumption is a result of or a cause of economic growth, there is no conclusive agreement on this issue, possibly due to other exogenous factors that may affect energy consumption and GDP simultaneously or sequentially (but have been ignored in most prior studies). Therefore, our study was aimed at studying the relationship between electricity consumption and GDP with the number of tourists and population as important exogenous factors in the world\u2019s gaming center \u2013 Macao SAR using Johansen\u2019s methodology [35].",

He mentioned that when b\n0\n = \nc\n0\n = 0, Eqs. (1), (2) are the expression for a simple causal model. Granger further noticed that\u201cWhether or not a model involving some group of economic variables can be a simple causal model depends on what one considers to be the speed with which information flows through the economy and also on the sampling period of the data used. It might be true that when quarterly data are used (let alone the annual data), for example, a simple causal model is not sufficient to explain the relationships between the variables, while for monthly data a simple causal model would be all that is required. Thus, some nonsimple causal models may be constructed not because of the basic properties of the economy being studied but because of the data being used. It has been shown elsewhere that a simple causal mechanism can appear to be a feedback mechanism if the sampling period for the data is so long that details of causality cannot be picked out.\u201d (Granger, 1969, p. 427)\n",

Engle and Granger [18] stated that economic variables themselves may not be stationary and can have infinite variance, however, they can achieve temporarily stationary after differencing d times (where d is 1, 2, \u2026 and so on) and the series can be designated as I(d). When two economic variables Xt and Yt are both I(d), it is generally true that the linear combination Zt\n = \nXt\n \u2212 \naYt will also be I(d) [or I(d\n \u2212 \nb), b\n > 0. When the latter case occurs, a very special constraint operates on the long-run components of the series. And Xt and Yt are called co-integrated. Following this line, we first test the unit roots of Xt and Yt to confirm the stationary properties of each variable. This is achieved by using the Augmented Dickey\u2013Fuller [37] test and the Phillips\u2013Perron [38] test. For the time series Xt, the Augmented Dickey\u2013Fuller (ADF) relationship is expressed as:(3)\u0394Xt=\u03b1+(\u03c1\u22121)Xt\u22121+\u2211i=1p\u03b2i\u0394Xt\u2212i+\u025btwhere \u0394 is the difference operator, p is the auto-regressive lag length that has to be large enough to eliminate possible serial correlation in \u03b2i and \u03b1 and \u03c1 are the coefficients of interest.

Considering a structural form VAR of order p, we have(4)A0Zt=co+\u2211i=1kAiZt\u2212i+\u025bt,t=1,2,\u2026,Twhere k is the number of lags, Zt,Zt\n\u22121,\u2026,Zt\n\u2212k are (2 \u00d7 1) vectors containing the logarithmic of seasonally adjusted GDP\u2013ELEC pairs, A\n0 is an (2 \u00d7 2) structural coefficient matrix, A\n1,A\n2,\u2026,Ak are (2 \u00d7 2) lag coefficient matrices, c\no is an (2 \u00d7 1) vector containing constant terms, \u025bt is an (2 \u00d7 1) vector of disturbance terms. We can rewrite this structural VAR in error form (Verbeek [39], p. 326) as:(5)A0\u0394Zt=co+\u03a0Zt\u22121+\u2211i=1p\u22121\u0393i\u0394Zt\u2212i+\u025btwhere \u03a0=\u2211i=1pAi\u2212A0,\u0393i=\u2212\u2211j=t+1pAj,i=1,2,\u2026k\u22121. The \u03a0 matrix represents the adjustment to disequilibrium following an exogenous disturbance. If \u03a0 has a reduced rank r\n < \nk where r and k denote the rank of \u03a0 and the number of variables constituting the long-run relationship respectively, then there exist two k\n \u00d7 \nr matrices \u03b1 and \u03b2, each with rank r, such that \u03a0\n = \n\u03b1\u03b2\u2032 and \u03b2\u2032yt is stationary. r is called the co-integration rank and each column of \u03b2 is a co-integrating vector. Johansen\u2019s VAR method estimates the \u03a0 matrix from an unrestricted VAR and tests whether one can reject the restrictions implied by the reduced rank of \u03a0. There are two common approaches to test the reduced rank of \u03a0, namely the maximum eigenvalue test and the trace test. For the maximum eigenvalue test, the likelihood ratio is determined from:(6)LRmax(r|r+1)=\u2212Tln(1\u2212\u03bbr+1)where T is the maximum time in the time series t. The null hypothesis of r co-integrating vectors is tested against the alternative hypothesis of r\n + 1 or more co-integrating vectors. Since the co-integration tests are sensitive to the choice of lag length, we use the Schwartz Information Criteria to determine the optimal lag lengths. On the other hands, the likelihood ratio statistic for the trace test is:(7)LRtrace(r|k)=\u2212T\u2211i=r+1kln(1\u2212\u03bb\u02c6i)where \u03bb\u02c6i are the estimated 2 \u2212 \nr smallest values and r\n = 0 and 1. The null hypothesis is that there are at most r co-integrating vectors. The alternative is that there are r or more co-integrating vectors. Again, we use the Schwartz Information Criteria to determine the optimal lag lengths.",

The general VECM form is presented as follows.(8)\u0394Xt=\u03b1+\u2211i=1p\u03b2i\u0394Xt\u2212i+\u2211j=1q\u03b3j\u0394Yt\u2212j+\u03b4ECTt\u22121+\u03bct\n(9)\u0394Yt=a+\u2211i=1rbi\u0394Xt\u2212i+\u2211j=1scj\u0394Yt\u2212j++dECTt\u22121+vtwhere Xt and Yt represent the seasonally adjusted GDP and ELEC in logarithmic form, (\u0394Xt, \u0394Yt) are the differences in variables, and \u03b2i & \u03b3j and bi & cj capture the short-term relationships respectively. The \u03bct, vt are the serially uncorrelated error terms. The ECTt\n\u22121 is derived from the long-run co-integration relationship. The optimum lag lengths p, q, r and s are determined based on Schwartz Information Criteria.",

First, the goodness of fit of a VEC model describes how well the regenerated data fit a set of observations as it measures the variability between the actual data and the estimated data using VEC equations. The adjusted coefficient of determination (adjusted R\n2) was used to indicate the goodness of fit of the model investigated. The higher adjusted R\n2, the better goodness of fit. Moreover, the stability of VEC models is a statistical property of continuance to estimate the stable distributions provided by a linear combination of variables in models. For example, structural changes and/or discontinues in the data typically may cause unstable in estimated models. In VEC models, we applied unit-root tests for determining model stability. Furthermore, t-tests and Wald tests were applied to test whether the long-run relationships and short-run causalities exist in VEC models. In Wald tests, chi-square \u03c7\n2 statistics and their probabilities were obtained to determine the short-run causalities in VEC models, respectively. When the probability of chi-square statistics was below 5 percent, the null hypothesis was rejected based on the 5 percent significance level, implying a VEC model having a short-run causal relationship between dependent and independent variables.",

In Wald tests, all VEC models, except \u0394LGDPSA equations in VEC models (i.e. \u0394LGDPSA & \u0394LELECSA and \u0394LGDPSA & \u0394LELECSA & \u0394LTOURSA models) with lag number 3, failed the 5 percent significance level. Moreover, the goodness of fit for the VEC model with endogenous variables \u0394LGDPSA & \u0394LELECSA, exogenous variables C and lag number 1 was better than that of other models with lag number 1 in average. Moreover, when checking the above-mentioned VEC model, t statistic of exogenous variable \u0394LTOURSA(\u22121) (i.e. \u0394LTOURSA with lag number 1) in VEC equations cannot fulfill the t statistics requirement, thus removing \u0394LTOURSA(\u22121). After removing \u0394LTOURSA(\u22121), corresponding adjusted R-squared and stability in the VEC model with endogenous variables \u0394LGDPSA & \u0394LELECSA, exogenous variable C and lag number 1, were acceptable. Therefore, the VEC model with endogenous variables \u0394LGDPSA & \u0394LELECSA, exogenous variables C and lag number 1, was found to be the more appropriate one to describe the situation in Macao SAR. On the other hand, we then continued to perform t-test on the error correction term ECT\nt\u22121 for long-run causality and joint F test to determine whether short-run adjustment would re-establish long-run equilibrium or not. In Table 7, in VECM equations, the probability of the error correction term ECT\nt\u22121 in \u0394LGDPSA and \u0394LELECSA equations by t-test is 0.6077 and 0.0072 respectively. The results indicated that there was a unidirectional long-run causality from LGDPSA to LELECSA (i.e. LGDPSA\n \u2192 \nLELECSA in the long-run). Moreover, the joint F test for the sum of lagged terms of each explanatory variable (i.e. \u0394LGDPSA and \u0394LELECSA) and ECT\nt\u22121 term in \u0394LGDPSA and \u0394LELECSA equations evaluated whether short-run adjustment to re-establish long-run equilibrium, given a shock to the system. The results in Table 6\nshow that the joint significance of \u0394LGDPSA and ECT\nt\u22121 term in \u0394LELECSA equation existed but that of \u0394LELECSA and ECT\nt\u22121 term in \u0394LGDPSA equation did not exist. This implies that electricity consumption and gross domestic product interact in the short-term to restore long-term equilibrium after a change in gross domestic product. The situation is mainly caused by change in the number of tourists (and their spending behaviors) affecting electricity consumption and gross domestic product at the same time. And after a longer period, the responses in electricity consumption and gross domestic product become stable and restore the equilibrium between electricity consumption and gross domestic product.",

They represent that short-run and long-run relationships are different. The \u0394LGDPSA equation indicated that there was no short-run, long-run and joint short/long-run causality. The \u0394LELECSA equation, however, indicated that there was a long-run (and joint short/long-run) causality but no short-run causality. These results indicated that although no short-run causality from gross domestic product to electricity existed, short-run interaction can lead to a long-run causality.

Vector error correction models indicated that there was a long-run unidirectional causal relationship from gross domestic product to electricity consumption. Moreover, given a change in gross domestic product, gross domestic product and electricity consumption interacted in short-term and then re-established the long-run equilibrium. Co-integration test showed that seasonally adjusted gross domestic product, electricity and tourists\u2019 amount in natural log scale (LGDPSA, LELECSA and LTOURSA) were co-integrated. Although in previous section, we adopted the VEC model with \u0394LGDPSA and \u0394LELECSA only, change in the number of tourists (\u0394TOURSA) will have a peculiar effect on \u0394LGDPSA than on \u0394LELECSA. It can be understood because the gaming and tourism center in Asia Macao SAR depends heavily on the tourism industry (but in fact more on the high rollers among those tourists). The number of tourists (more specifically, the number of high rollers) affects significantly and positively on gross domestic product and in turn affects electricity consumption. A detailed observation of the \u0394LELECSA VEC equation reveals that \u0394LELECSA depends heavily and significantly on the lag 1 of \u0394LGDPSA. This implies that in a service-oriented territory, infrastructures such as casinos, hotels, resorts, convention centers, food-serving outlets, etc. have to be built (leading to a sudden increase in GDPSA) and operated to attract tourists, consequently leading to a positive change in the city\u2019s or national electricity consumption.",

First, a city can enjoy the economic growth brought by the development of the gaming and tourism industry but policy makers have to find ways to produce and utilize their electricity more environmentally friendly and efficiently. It is because the depletion of energy resources and the emission of carbon dioxide \u2013 a major greenhouse gas are recognized as international problems. Nevertheless, it is possible that operators of entertainment venues can adopt a wide range of energy saving practices, such as adopting variable speed drives for fans, pumps and lifts, introducing heat exchangers and heat pumps in air-conditioning and refrigerating systems, and adopting energy-efficient and yet cost effective and environmental-friendly commercial applicants [46], etc. Second, whether the gaming industry will bring negative impacts on social and cultural systems is debatable [47].
