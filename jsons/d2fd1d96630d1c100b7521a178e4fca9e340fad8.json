A transient change in local hemodynamic factors, coagulation activation, reduced generation of anticoagulant activated protein C (APC), inhibition of fibrinolysis and endothelial cell perturbation as a result of systemic inflammation might be underlying mechanisms [4, 5] . Indeed, it has been shown that respiratory viruses are able to activate coagulation, causing a reduction in clotting time and an increase in the expression of tissue factor and thrombin generation, the latter by reduced levels of protein C [6, 7] . Also, increased levels of hemostatic proteins during symptoms of acute respiratory tract infection have been shown [8, 9] . Endothelial cell perturbation and increased levels of hemostatic markers, such as von Willebrand factor (VWF), D-dimer, plasmin-a2-antiplasmin complexes (PAP) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), are risk factors for ischemic heart disease [10] [11] [12] . High VWF levels are also related to a short-term increased risk of plaque rupture and subsequent thrombus formation [13] .",

However, the significantly elevated ETP suggests the potential for increased thrombin formation and therefore a procoagulant state during the acute phase of a respiratory tract infection. The increased levels of D-dimer do indicate enhanced in vivo thrombin formation, but this may in part be as a result of the enhanced fibrinolysis that was observed. The apparent paradox between D-dimer and F1 + 2 may also be explained by the shorter half-life of F1 + 2 compared with D-dimer.",

Because VWF, PAP complexes, ETP and resistance to APC have been suggested to increase the risk of ischemic heart disease and venous thromboembolism [10, 11, 17, 18] , we suggest that the induced hemostatic changes may form a link between acute respiratory tract infections and acute atherothrombotic disease. The precise relation to risk still needs to be established in (large) prospective studies.",
