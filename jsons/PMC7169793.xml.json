Such diseases continue to sporadically re\u2010emerge as a result of biosecurity and/or vaccination failures. Recently, FMD outbreaks in Japan and South Korea had a major impact on the international swine industry (Seneque, 2011). Classical swine fever continues to cause high mortality in back\u2010yards and small holders, decreasing incomes and food security in many rural Asian villages. Occasionally, the virus spills into industrial farms, causing varying economic loss, depending on herd immune status. Similarly, AD seems currently under control through routine vaccination, but it remains endemic in most of SEA. Affected countries have committed significant financial resources to vaccination and diagnostics for the prevention and control these infectious swine diseases.",

These diseases became endemic owing to previously unrestricted animal movements and biosecurity failures between and within these countries. It should be noted that highly pathogenic PRRS (HP\u2010PRRS), first recognized in China in 2006 (An et al., 2010), has spread to the Philippines (Barrette et al., 2009), Vietnam (Tung et al., 2011), Cambodia (Theary et al., 2011), Lao PDR (Phommachanh et al., 2011), Thailand (Thanawongnuwech, 2011) and most recently to Myanmar (Ling Ling Bo, 2011, personal communication).

However, epidemiological evidence suggests that carrier animals transported within disease\u2010affected countries and across international borders are often the origin of outbreaks of acute FMD (Sobrino et al., 2001). The carrier state, which can last as long as 3.5 years in cattle, has also been identified in sheep and goats, but not in pigs (Alexandersen et al., 2002). Several outbreaks in southern Thailand and northern Malaysia serve as examples for the spread of FMD from endemic hotspots to neighbouring areas owing to cattle movements. Risk assessments for trans\u2010boundary movement of FMD include environmental factors, religious and cultural practices, disease incidence status, range of farming systems, trans\u2010boundary animal and animal product trade pathways, and national disease control and biosecurity capabilities.",

            "text": "Vaccines play a major role in FMD control, both in endemic and in non\u2010endemic areas, and are also used strategically as an aid for outbreak control and eradication efforts, as neutralizing antibodies appear as early as 7 days and reach maximum titres within 2 weeks after vaccination (Sobrino et al., 2001). However, vaccination with one FMD serotype does not confer cross\u2010protection against other serotypes. In addition, vaccine efficacy may vary among isolates of the same FMD serotype owing to antigenic diversity. It should be noted that, while vaccination may slow an outbreak in swine, it is highly advisable to implement additional control measures, such as pre\u2010emptive culling of in\u2010contact swine herds, as FMD vaccination in pigs may be less effective in comparison to ruminants (Orsel and Bouma, 2009). For decades, Thailand has implemented a mass vaccination strategy using trivalent vaccines produced from local isolates. However, vaccination is not uniform in most countries, as routine FMD vaccinations are used primarily in commercial herds owing to expense. Back\u2010yards and small holders are thus at increased risk of FMD, and often serve as virus reservoirs, especially in areas where the risk of FMD incursion is high (Rast et al., 2010). Increased animal populations always create highly susceptible subpopulations and greater risks of FMD exposure and spreading. Quarantine and other biocontainment measures for early FMD cases in affected herds or villages could reduce the spread of disease within and between villages. Increasing overall national herd vaccination coverage, mandatory vaccination, vaccine subsidies, and mass vaccination initiatives should be implemented in endemic countries.",

The trans\u2010boundary nature of FMD suggests that efficacious FMD control may depend on the collaborative multicountry disease control initiatives of the SEAFMDC. The FMD laboratory centre in Pakchong, Thailand, has been recognized as an OIE Reference Laboratory for FMD, serving as a hub for diagnostic support and vaccine production in SEA. To identify the risk factors and critical points of animal movement for FMD control, social networks and relevant stakeholders should work together to devise mutually accepted regulatory and non\u2010regulatory recommendations to reduce the risks of FMD spreading in their respective countries. A zoning system is recommended for FMD endemic countries, such as Thailand, that wish to propose an FMD\u2010free zone, such as that currently being established in eastern Thailand. However, establishing FMD\u2010free zones can be problematic, as measures for strict biosecurity control may affect the daily lives of native residents. Sustained commitments from governments, cooperative diplomatic relationships, and public awareness campaigns are critical to FMD control to ensure collaboration among veterinarians, traders and farmers. Encouraging key stakeholders and farmers to follow proper biosecurity measures is critical to effectively limiting disease transmission. The effective eradication of FMD in the Philippines in 2005 and the successful control of FMD in Vietnam in 2006 have been largely attributed to effective strategies for facilitating communication among government officials, veterinarians, traders and farmers (Abila and Kalpravidh, 2011). More intensive epidemiological investigations of outbreaks and continued field research are needed to ensure effective control when future outbreaks occur. Because of its serious direct effect on animal health and production and its indirect socio\u2010economic effect on trade in animals and animal products, FMD is currently a major trans\u2010boundary animal disease in the countries of mainland SEA. Continued political commitment and proper allocation of resources from each member country are most critical to the success of the SEAFMDC (Abila and Kalpravidh, 2011)",

            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) was demonstrated serologically in Canada in 1979 and was subsequently isolated in Europe in 1991 (Wensvoort et al., 1991). It has since spread to the rest of the world, where it was serologically demonstrated in Thailand in 1989 (Thanawongnuwech et al., 2004a, 2004b). PRRSV belongs to the family Arteriviridae, genus Arterivirus, generally divided into two major genotypes, European (EU) and North American (NA). PRRS continues to be a major economically important swine disease, especially with regard to co\u2010infection with other respiratory pathogens, as represented in the porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC) (Thanawongnuwech et al., 2000). Porcine respiratory disease complex symptoms in younger pigs include slow growth, decreased feed efficiency, anorexia, fever, cough and dyspnoea. Reproductive failure in sows and temporary infertility in boars are also prominent in susceptible breeders. Antigenic and genetic heterogeneities of PRRSV and quasispecies evolution are well described (Goldberg et al., 2003; Schommer and Kleiboeker, 2006). Coexistence of mixed PRRSV genotypes or strains within the same herd becomes potentially problematic to control, as cross\u2010protection can vary from complete to non\u2010existent (Thanawongnuwech et al., 2004a, 2004b), and inter\u2010strain recombination has been observed in the field in China (Li et al., 2009), all of which serve as significant obstacles to effective transmission control using vaccines and management strategies.",

Following the outbreaks of swine high fever (SHF) syndrome caused by highly pathogenic (HP)\u2010PRRSV in China, many genetic variants of this particular Chinese virus have been subsequently characterized, and recent data suggest that those variants originated from the CH\u20101a strain isolated in southern China (An et al., 2010). The severe clinical manifestation of this particular Chinese HP\u2010PRRSV could possibly be caused by a combination of HP\u2010 PRRSV and other pathogens such as classical swine fever virus (CSFV), porcine circovirus 2 (PCV\u20102), or non\u2010pathogenic Streptococcus suis serotype 7 (Xu et al., 2010). Strains of Chinese HP\u2010PRRSV containing typical two discontinuous sequence deletions in the nsp2 gene were initially identified in 2006 and have continued to cause economic damage in China, Vietnam (Wu et al., 2009), the Philippines, Lao PDR and more recently in Thailand\u2019s NongKai province (August 2010), where high mortality rates in all age groups were similar to previous outbreaks in Lao DPR. Concurrently, PCV2 and CSFV were also demonstrated by PCR (Chulalongkorn University\u2010Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, CU\u2010VDL) in the affected tissue samples from NongKai province. Trans\u2010boundary transmission of HP\u2010PRRSV likely occurs via the pig trade in the border areas, as epidemiologic evidence suggests for outbreaks that occurred early in northern (April 2010) and southern (July 2010) Vietnam (Tung et al., 2011), Lao DPR (June 2010) (Phommachanh et al., 2011), Cambodia (July 2010) (Theary et al., 2011), Thailand (August 2010) and Myanmar (February 2011) (Ling Ling Bo, 2011, personal communication). Trans\u2010boundary spreading of HP\u2010PRRSV from southern China to SEA clearly represents biosecurity failures through failure to control the animal movement and trading among neighbouring countries at the border areas. Spreading of the virus within a country also confirms the failure of biosecurity control, primarily via uncontrolled human movements within highly contaminated areas, especially at loading zones and slaughter houses (R. Thanawongnuwech, personal observation). Sharing such contaminated areas with other vehicles may increase pathogen spreading within the community.",

In addition, a recent isolate (10UT02_Udonthani1.1) is genetically very similar to the Chinese HP\u2010PRRS MLV vaccine (JXA1; Beijing Anheal Laboratories Co., Ltd., Beijing, China). It should be noted that the Ingelvac\u00ae PRRS ATP vaccine (Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica, Inc., St Joseph, MO, USA) is also genetically quite similar to the HP\u2010PRRSV. A highly virulent strain, atypical PRRSV, which emerged in the United States in 1996, is the parent strain of the Ingelvac\u00ae PRRS ATP vaccine (Kim et al., 2008). Coincidently, the atypical PRRSV and the Chinese HP\u2010PRRSV did cause similar clinical signs, including the sow abortion and mortality syndrome. These viruses might share some virulent factors genetically. The evolution of the Chinese HP\u2010PRRSV needs further investigation.",

The primary routes of PRRSV transmission include direct contact, aerosol transmission, vertical transmission in sows, infected semen for AI and mechanical infection via infected needles or carrier insects (Pitkin et al., 2009a, 2009b).

            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV), a Coronavirus, is the aetiological agent of porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED). Porcine epidemic diarrhoea causes acute enteritis and severe diarrhoea with high mortality, particularly in suckling piglets (Pensaert and Yeo, 2006). Porcine epidemic diarrhoea was first identified in England in 1971. It has become a problematic disease, causing economic losses primarily in Europe and Asia (Pensaert and Yeo, 2006; Park et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2008). In late 2007, severe PED outbreaks re\u2010emerged in central Thailand, and the disease is now endemic throughout the country (Puranaveja et al., 2009). Recent PED outbreaks were characterized by severe watery diarrhoea and dehydration with milk curd vomitus in all affected naive suckling piglets. Interestingly, pigs of all ages presented diarrhoea and off\u2010feed to varying degrees, indicating a lack of significant previous immunity. Boars and sows manifested mild diarrhoea and off\u2010feed, but recovered within a few days. When affected suckling piglets were necropsied, the wall of the small intestine was congested, thin and demonstrated segmental enteritis characterized by segmental absence of intestinal lacteal, which likely contributed to malabsorption. Severe atrophic enteritis characterized by blunting of the intestinal villi and sloughing of intestinal epithelium was also prominent in all affected piglets. To control outbreaks in endemic areas, massive feedback of piglet faeces and minced piglet gut to the gestating sows was recommended to prime the immune response and promote lactogenic immunity in suckling piglets. This practice may, however, contribute to the virus becoming endemic in affected farms. Interestingly, immunity from previous endemic PEDV strains and the immunity induced by the commercial Korean vaccine do not provide cross\u2010protection to the recent Chinese PEDV strain (personal observation). As the immunity induced from gut feed back to the sows and replacement gilts is not life long, sporadic outbreaks continually occur in the endemic farms, especially in the subpopulation of non\u2010immunized gilts. If endemic virus is diagnosed in consecutive litters of weaned piglets after an outbreak, virus elimination should be carried out by nursery depopulation or the relocation of infected pigs for 4 weeks post\u2010weaning to avoid re\u2010breaking. The emerging Chinese PEDV is currently prevalent in Thailand and continues to cause sporadic outbreaks. Thus, stimulating PEDV\u2010specific immunity in all stocks is recommended, particularly for replacement animals when facing an acute PED outbreak. Therefore, effective biosecurity control is always a key component of PED prevention and control. Strict sanitary measures should be taken to prevent new introduction of PEDV to the naive farm. Introduction of persistently infected pigs always poses the highest risk, and the disease can also be spread by contaminated vehicles and human traffic between affected farms.",

These data support the observations of other investigators that suggest the Chinese isolate, JS\u20102004\u20102, may be the source of outbreaks in neighbouring countries, including Thailand and Vietnam (Puranaveja et al., 2009; Duy et al., 2011). It should be noted that the epidemiology of PED outbreaks in Thailand and Vietnam might not involve the animal movement at the borders, as early outbreaks occurred in the intensive pig raising areas of the countries, rather than the border areas. In addition, recent Korean PEDV field isolates were also genetically similar to the Chinese strains, but differed genetically from the European strains and vaccine strains used in Korea and China (Chen et al., 2010; Park et al., 2011). Currently, the route of PED introduction into Thailand, Vietnam, and Korea has not clearly been elucidated. Most emerging disease outbreaks are the result of transmission of the causative agent across borders. Interestingly, while reports of PED outbreaks have been widespread in Europe and Asia, none have been reported in the Americas since 1980 (Turgeon et al., 1980). The absence of PED in the Americas is likely attributable to geographic isolation, effective preventive strategies, and biosecurity, as movement of live animals, breeding stocks, and human movement across borders are the major risk factors for the transmission of most emerging trans\u2010boundary diseases.",

Following the introduction of PED by such means, animal and human movements contribute further to transmission among neighbouring farms. Establishment of a national strategy for prevention and control of PED requires blocking the epizootic\u2013enzootic circulation of the virus. Therefore, the clear elucidation of origin and transmission routes of this emerging Chinese\u2010like PEDV will contribute to a better understanding of risk factors and the development of effective prevention and control strategies. The presence of the Chinese\u2010like strains in Thailand, Vietnam and Korea raise major questions regarding which currently available PEDV vaccine will be most effective for controlling the Chinese\u2010like PED epidemic.",

            "text": "Similar to the H1N1 pandemic of 2009, increasing globalization has likely contributed to the recent emergence of trans\u2010boundary swine diseases in SEA (Sreta et al., 2010). Disease transmission can occur through the movement of infected animals and animal products, contaminated vehicles, and human traffic, particularly animal workers and traders. Surveillance of the infectious agents must include both wild and domestic animal populations and their environments and should be internationally coordinated through the establishment of a collaborative network. For example, FMD risk assessments should involve collaboration among neighbouring countries. Neighbouring government authorities, veterinarians, social networks, stakeholders and farmers must work together to identify the risk factors to reduce trans\u2010boundary FMD virus transmission. Fortunately, FMD vaccination can be effective when used uniformly to prevent and control the disease. Unlike FMD virus, the current HP\u2010PRRSV control strategies are not predictably successful, neither conventional control strategies, nor commercially available vaccines, owing to native virulence, a lack of cross\u2010protection, and severe immunosuppressive effects. Rigorous biosecurity must ultimately play a critical role in HP\u2010PRRSV control if eradication is to be achieved. Similarly, the Chinese\u2010like PEDV has become endemic in Thailand and Vietnam, and sporadically causes problems in subpopulations of naive suckling piglets in endemic areas. Current commercial PED vaccines do not induce effective lactogenic immunity to the Chinese\u2010like PEDV. As practicing gut feed back to the sows and replacement gilts may contaminate the herd with unwanted organisms, virus elimination should be carried out by sow\u2010herd stabilization and nursery depopulation to avoid re\u2010breaking with the virus. Sustained maintenance of sow immunity prior to farrowing by whole herd and regular gilt acclimatizations may represent an alternative tool for control of PED. Lastly, the support of the OIE and FAO in designing surveillance and control methods specifically for these Asian countries would highlight the global importance of efforts to stem the spread of these infectious trans\u2010boundary swine diseases.",
