IFNs are composed of three subgroups: type I, type II, and type III IFNs. The type I IFNs, including IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03b5, IFN-\u03c9, IFN-\u03ba, IFN-\u03b4, IFN-\u03c4, and IFN-\u03b6, exert biological activity through common receptors (interferon-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor 1 [IFNAR1] and IFNAR2) [3], [4]. Type II IFN, namely IFN-\u03b3, is produced by T lymphocytes and natural killer cells in response to the recognition of infected cells [5]. Type III IFNs consist of IFN-\u03bb1, IFN-\u03bb2, and IFN-\u03bb3, which regulate the immune response via a distinct receptor complex that uses a signaling pathway that is similar to that of type I IFNs [6], [7].",

IFN-\u03c9 diverged from the IFN-\u03b1 gene approximately 130 million years ago, and it is produced primarily in leukocytes [10]. Human IFN-\u03c9 genes include four pseudogenes and one full gene that is expressed in leukocytes, and human IFN-\u03c9 shares 62% amino acid sequence homology and similar functions with IFN-\u03b1, and 33% amino acid similarity with IFN-\u03b2 [11]. Similar to other IFNs, IFN-\u03c9 is also produced by cells in response to viral infection, and it has biological activities because it binds to the same receptors and activates a pathway that is similar to that activated by IFNAR [12], while the activation of phosphoinositide-3-kinase/protein kinase B (P13K/Akt) signaling is also vital for biological responses mediated by IFN-\u03c9 [13]. However, its antigenic structure is distantly related to IFN-\u03b1, -\u03b2, and -\u03bb, as it does not cross-react with antibodies against them [14]. As a result, treatment with IFN-\u03c9 can be effective for patients who are resistant to IFN-\u03b1 [15]. Although IFN-\u03c9 has been studied extensively, our knowledge of IFN-\u03c9 is still limited compared with that of interferon IFN-\u03b1 and -\u03b2. Here, we provide a broad review of what is known about the biological activities and potential clinical application of IFN-\u03c9. Overall, we hope that the information provided in this review will stimulate further studies of IFN-\u03c9 as a therapeutic agent.",

            "text": "Until now, IFN-\u03c9 has been identified in humans [8], felines [16], pigs [17], horses [18], rabbits [19], serotine bats [20], cattle [21], and sheep [22], while it has not been found in canines and mice [21]; however, the characteristics of IFN-\u03c9 differ in different species. The characteristics of IFN-\u03c9 from different species are summarized in Table 1\n. Despite such differences, there are common characteristics that exist in these species. Generally, IFN-\u03c9 genes are intronless, and N-glycosylation sites (not present in felines) and transcription factor binding sites, such as IRFs, ISREs, and NF-\u03baB, are present in the promoter regions of these genes [9], [10], [20], [30]. In addition, all mammalian IFN-\u03c9 genes lack the proline codon that precedes the final conserved cysteine codon [24]. The IFN-\u03c9 protein contains several conserved residues, such as arginine at position 161, cysteine residues at positions 1 and 99 and 100, seven prolines (four of which are located at positions 4, 26, 39, and 117 of the mature protein), while positions 29 and 139 and 140 form two disulfide bonds. These residues are present at similar locations in type I IFNs, and they are vital for their biological activity [33]. Other conserved structural motifs, such as the regions between amino acid residues 29\u201341, 71\u201382, and 123\u2013142, are highly conserved among IFN-\u03b1 proteins, and they play a key role in the biological activity of IFN-\u03c9 [26], [28], [29]. In addition to having a structure that is similar to that of type I IFNs, IFN-\u03c9 also displays the same physicochemical characteristics as type I IFNs, such as high sensitivity to trypsin, insensitivity to temperature, and stability at pH 2 [28], [29]. Some studies revealed that IFN-\u03c9 loses its antiviral activities after being treated with 0.25% trypsin. However, it retains high antiviral activity against vesicular stomatitis virus after exposure to pH 2 for 24 h at temperatures ranging from 42 \u00b0C to 63 \u00b0C [26], [28], [29]. Based on analyses of phylogenetic trees obtained from alignments of the IFN-\u03c9 protein sequences from these mammal species, it was proposed that all these proteins evolved from a common ancestor [20], [28].",

            "text": "Type I IFNs, including IFN-\u03c9 and IFN-\u03b1, display a common mechanism of action. IFNs interact with specific cell-surface receptors, and then the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) is induced, some of which encode antiviral effectors or molecules, such as signaling proteins, transcription factors, and apoptotic proteins, while chemokines further regulate IFN signaling and other host responses in a positive or negative manner [28]. IFN-\u03c9 is not an exception. It has been proposed that IFN-\u03c9 shares antiviral activities with IFN-\u03b1 because it binds to the same type I IFN receptor complex. Studies have revealed that IFN-\u03c9 induces the transcription of the Mx1, ISG15, IFIT3, and ISG56 genes [20], [28]. However, different from IFN-\u03b1, it shows certain degrees of cross-species activity; therefore, IFNs could exhibit different physiological functions in the host. For example, bovine IFN-\u03c9 (BoIFN-\u03c9) protects Madin\u2013Darby bovine kidney cells, primary embryo bovine lung cells, feline kidney cells, porcine kidney cells, rabbit kidney cells, and primary bovine testicular cells from vesicular stomatitis virus challenge. However, the antiviral activities of BoIFN-\u03c9 are low in Madin\u2013Darby bovine kidney cells, but high in porcine kidney and bovine testicular cells. Additionally, no protective effects were found on Madin\u2013Darby bovine kidney cells and baby hamster kidney cells [28], [29]. These results suggest that cells have a tendency to be insensitive to IFN-\u03c9 from distantly related species. The antiviral activities of IFN-\u03c9 also vary with the subtypes and viral strain used in challenges. In a previous study, the expression of PoIFN-\u03c92/-\u03c96, PoIFN-\u03c93/-\u03c95, and PoIFN-\u03c98 were upregulated, while PoIFN-\u03c91 (which has 11 fewer residues at its carboxyl terminus than the other PoIFN-\u03c9 subtypes) was not detected in porcine kidney cells challenged with pseudorabies virus or poly(I):poly(C). Interestingly, the level of PoIFN-\u03c91 also increased when peripheral blood mononuclear cells were challenged with pseudorabies virus, and PoIFN-\u03c92/-\u03c96 was upregulated the most in these studies [26]. Similarly, recombinant serotine bats IFN-\u03c9 can inhibit European bat lyssavirus type 1, European bat lyssavirus type 2, and rabies virus replication in a dose-dependent manner, and different biological activities were elicited (in the order of European bat lyssavirus type 1 < rabies virus < European bat lyssavirus type 2) [20].",

When A549 cells were respectively treated with IFN-\u03c9 and type I and type III IFNs, the cells treated with IFN-\u03c9 at a concentration of 10 ng/ml obviously repressed the replication of influenza A virus in a dose-dependent manner, and it resulted in larger reductions in viral titers, compared with those obtained with IFN-\u03b12 [34]. However, its activity was much lower than the activity of IFN-\u03b21, and it was slightly lower than the activities of IFN-\u03bb1 and IFN-\u03bb2. Depending on the dose, pretreating Caco-2 cells with human IFN-\u03c9 significantly reduced the loads of the H1N1 influenza virus [35]. Interestingly, IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03c9 showed similar inhibitory activity against both Ca/04 and BJ/501 influenza viruses at every concentration tested. In addition, both were significantly more potent than IFN-\u03b1 as far as the inhibitory effects on both stains at a given concentration. In addition to its in vitro activities, IFN-\u03c9 has been demonstrated to have antiviral activity in vivo as well. For example, a robust induction of Mx mRNA and the OAS-1A protein was found in animals treated by IFN-\u03c9 compared with controls [35]. Furthermore, following daily intravenous treatment with human IFN-\u03c9 (HuIFN-\u03c9), the viral load of H1N1 influenza virus decreased significantly in the lung tissues of guinea pigs, and IFN-\u03c9 exhibited an identical inhibitory effect against the Ca/04 influenza virus compared with IFN-\u03b1 [35].",

            "text": "Although IFN-\u03c9 has demonstrated promising antiviral activity against some viral infections in vivo and vitro, several factors could limit its antiviral efficacy, such as poor pharmacokinetics and a short half-life [36]. PEGylation, a covalent conjugation of nontoxic polyethylene glycol (PEG), has been demonstrated to improve the plasma half-life of a therapeutic protein and decrease its proteolytic sensitivity [37]. Recently, Yu et al. [38] found that PEGylation improved the poor pharmacokinetics of recombinant HuIFN-\u03c9 (rHuIFN-\u03c9), despite the fact that its antiviral activity was decreased to some extent. It is worth noting that the bioactivity of PEGylated rHuIFN-\u03c9 was determined by examining its PEGylation sites, in which residues at the amino-terminus had higher activities compared with those of residues Lys134 and Lys152, while the poor pharmacokinetics were determined by the conjugated PEG mass. In a previous study, amino-terminally PEGylated rHuIFN-\u03c9 with 40 kDa of linear PEG, which exhibited 21.7% of the rHuIFN-\u03c9 biological activity with a half-life of 139.6 h, allowed some viral diseases to be treated by fewer doses at longer dosing intervals [38]. The use of human IgG1 Fc fusion proteins has also been demonstrated to be a simple and effective method for prolonging serum half-life [39]. Some studies showed that compared with rHuIFN-\u03c9 expressed in yeast with a specific activity of 7 \u00d7 107\n IU/mg, rHuIFN-\u03c9-Fc had a lower activity of 1.6 \u00d7 107\n IU/mg when it was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Furthermore, the terminal half-life of rHuIFN-\u03c9-Fc was 35-fold higher than that of rHuIFN-\u03c9, and it exhibited better pharmacokinetics characteristics [40]. Perhaps rHuIFN-\u03c9-Fc will become a new alternative antiviral drug for the treatment of chronic viral infections.",

A possible explanation for its potency is that glycosylated IFN-\u03c9 could induce the activation of the sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor, the activating enhancer binding protein 2-like YY1 site, the interferon consensus sequence binding protein, the erythroid Kruppel-like factor gene, the homeotic gene forkhead of Drosophila 8/hepatocyte nuclear factor 3/mouse forkhead lung protein, HNF-1\u03b1, the interferon conserved sequence-binding protein, and the lymphocyte-enriched DNA binding protein LyF, which are not induced by IFN-\u03b1 [41]. Glycosylated IFN-\u03c9 also exhibits good clinical applications. Previous studies showed that glycosylated IFN-\u03c9 + ribavirin (RBV) had a synergistic effect in terms of its antiviral activity in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients [43]. Similarly, a synergy of the antiviral effects of glycosylated IFN-\u03c9 + RBV against bovine viral diarrhea virus was also obtained. Interestingly, an antagonism of the cytotoxic effects of RBV by glycosylated IFN-\u03c9 was observed [43]. Thus, the combination of glycosylated IFN-\u03c9 and RBV appears to be favorable for the synergy of antiviral activities and the antagonism of the cytotoxic effects of RBV.",

In general, increasing the number of ISGs, Mx proteins, and ZAPS, which could enhance pathogen detection and innate immune signaling, indicates that IFN-\u03c9 elicits an immune response. When cells are treated with IFN-\u03c9, Mx-1, ISG15, IFIT3, and ISG56 expression was upregulated in a dose-dependent or time-dependent manner [20], [29]. More recently, studies from Leal et al. [49] showed that interleukin (IL)-6 production was affected considerably in feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)-infected cats treated with recombinant feline IFN-\u03c9 (rFeIFN-\u03c9) by subcutaneous or oral protocols. Specifically, IL-6 plasma levels decreased and proviral loads increased in FIV-cats treated subcutaneously with rFeIFN-\u03c9, while IL-6 mRNA expression decreased in the oral group. However, the therapy did not affect viremia and the expression of other cytokines (IL-1, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12p40, IFN-\u03b3, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1) [49]. Thus, IFN-\u03c9 appears to be involved in innate immunity, and it could further inhibit viral replication and exert its antiviral activity.",

            "text": "IFN-\u03c9 also exhibits antitumor activity in vitro in a cell-specific manner. Feline mammary carcinomas are among the most common feline tumors, and they represent an important cause of mortality. When used to treat feline and canine mammary carcinoma cells and derived putative tumor-initiating cells, rFeIFN-\u03c9 exhibited a dose-dependent, species-specific, target cell-specific action, and an additive effect was observed between rFeIFN-\u03c9 and conventional anticancer drugs such as mitoxantrone, doxorubicin, and vincristine [51]. Thus, rFeIFN-\u03c9 may be used as a therapeutic agent in feline and canine mammary carcinomas. There is evidence showing that gene transfer would allow one to take advantage of the beneficial effects of type I IFNs without their undesirable side effects [52]. For instance, HuIFN\u03b2 gene lipofection produces an equal or even superior effect than that of high doses of exogenously applied HuIFN\u03b2 protein. Recently, a study conducted by Villaverde et al. [52] demonstrated that felines FeIFN-\u03c9 gene lipofection exhibited an equal or higher cytotoxic effect than rFeIFN-\u03c9. This kind of effect was due to the induction of reactive oxygen species generation, mitochondrial membrane potential disruption, and calcium uptake, indicating that fFeIFN-\u03c9 lipofection is an alternative approach for treating both sensitive and resistant phenotypes with an equal or superior outcome and with fewer adverse effects than recombinant fFeIFN-\u03c9 therapy [52]. Similarly, injecting the gene encoding interferon \u03c91 via the tail vein into mice bearing a Hep-A-22 liver tumor via liposomal gene delivery also significantly decreased tumor weights [53]. Interestingly, this effect was greater (43% tumor inhibition) only when the plasmid contained human thymosin alpha 1 [53]. A DNA ladder (a hallmark of cells undergoing apoptosis) was observed in the tumor cells treated by IFN-\u03c9. Interestingly, the anti-tumor mechanisms involve increasing the expression of T\u03b11 and IFN-\u03c9, and a plasmid-liposome complex of IFN-\u03c9 and IFN-\u03b1 together exerted greater potency in inhibiting the growth of Hep-A-22 tumor cells than either compound alone [53].",

Until now, a combination of IFN-\u03b1 and RBV has been the standard of care for chronic HCV infections [65], [66]. However, it has many deleterious side effects. Furthermore, some HCV chronic carriers are not suitable for this therapy, and new antiviral approaches are needed. Some studies showed that IFN-\u03c9 was equally effective at inhibiting HCV replication compared to IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2. Interestingly, the combinations of IFN-\u03c9 and IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b2 exhibited primarily antagonistic interactions [67]. In addition, other studies showed that the activity of non-glycosylated IFN-\u03c9 was comparable to that of IFN-\u03b1, while glycosylated IFN-\u03c9 was more potent in repressing HCV RNA replicons. Thus, IFN-\u03c9 can be used as a prospective antiviral candidate for the treatment of HCV infections [41].",

            "text": "In addition to being a potential therapy for HCV, IFN-\u03c9 could also be used to diagnose some human diseases. APS-1 is a monogenic disease that is caused by mutations in the autoimmune regulator (AIRE) gene [68], [69]. Currently, many autoantibodies, including those targeting aromatic acid decarboxylase, tyrosine hydroxylase, NACHT leucine-rich repeat protein 5, tryptophan hydroxylase, and IFN-\u03c9, have been found in APS-1 patients [55]. A study has shown an anti-IFN-\u03c9 antibody was highly prevalent in APS-1 patients with mutated AIRE alleles, even though the presence of anti-IFN-\u03c9 antibodies preceded APS-1 clinical symptoms and the development of other autoantibodies [70]. Therefore, antibodies against IFN-\u03c9 have become an essential diagnostic tool for APS-1. Numerous available assays, such as immunoassays, radioligand binding assays, and antiviral neutralization assays, were designed to detect anti-IFN-\u03c9 antibodies [70], [71], [72]. However, all of them have drawbacks, including a lack of sensitivity, the use of radioisotopes, the requirement for facilities to grow viral cultures, as well as being time-consuming. Some novels diagnosed methods were also developed. Zhang et al. [73] reported that an IPA based on 125I-labeled IFN-\u03c9 showed higher sensitivity to APS-1 than other anti-type 1 IFN antibodies when 48 APS-1 patients were examined. Similar to the study by Zhang et al., 48 APS-1 patients were also investigated in a study by Oftedal et al. [74], and these patients were also positive for anti-IFN-\u03c9 antibodies, as determined by an IPA based on 35S-labeled IFN-\u03c9, which also exhibit a greater correlation to APS-1 than other anti-type 1 IFN antibodies. These results suggest that out of the spectrum of anti-type 1 IFN antibodies, testing for anti-IFN-\u03c9 antibodies is more suitable for patients suspected of having APS-1. Recently, Larosa et al. [75] developed a novel, highly sensitive, and specific assay to measure anti-IFN-\u03c9 antibodies. They found that 125I-labeled IFN-\u03c9 and 35S assays resulted in 5/6 and 1/6 discrepant samples, respectively, which agrees with AIRE gene results [75]. Regarding the measurement of anti-IFN-\u03c9 antibodies in the studied patients, the 125I assay seems to have a better performance, as it is disease-specific, more reliable, and more precise than the 35S assay, making it possible to assess patients with APS-1 and patients suspected of having APS-1 prior to an AIRE gene analysis.",

Unfortunately, there are still no direct-acting antiviral drugs for the treatment of FCV. Previous studies demonstrated that rFeIFN-\u03c9 had a positive therapeutic effect in FCV-infected cats in some experiments or trials [46], [57], [78]. Combination antiviral therapy has become a common practice. Recently, researchers revealed that a combination treatment of rFeIFN-\u03c9 and mefloquine resulted in additive effects with a reduction in the half maximal inhibitory concentration [79]. Another study conducted by Lee et al. [80] showed that the relative expression of IFN-\u03c9, Mx, and ZAPS mRNA in Crandell-Reese Feline Kidney cells was upregulated significantly in FCV-infected cats. Interestingly, after the cats were pretreated with a Korean red ginseng (KRG) extract or ginsenosides, the expression of these genes was higher than that in the group treated with FCV alone [80]. It is desirable to find a combination of a KRG extract or ginsenosides and IFN-\u03c9 that effectively treats FCV-infected cats. Because of its similar structural characteristics and genomic structure, FCV could be a representative human norovirus surrogate [81]; thus, these therapies could also be used to treat human norovirus infections.",

It has been demonstrated that rFeIFN-\u03c9 has a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the replication of FHV-1 in vitro [83]. Several studies showed conflicting results about the biological activity of rFeIFN-\u03c9 against these two viruses in cats. For instance, 160 cats suffering from FCV-associated feline upper respiratory tract disease were treated with an intravenous dose of 2.5 or 5 MU/kg rFeIFN-\u03c9 three times per day every other day [82]. While improved clinical signs were detected within 7 days, no control group was used in this study. In another study, 20 cats with FHV-1-associated ocular keratitis were treated five times per day with a dose of 0.5 MU/mL rFeIFN-\u03c9, and although a significant improvement of ocular signs was observed after 3 weeks of treatment, no control group was included [83]. In 2007, using a placebo as a control group, the effect of rFeIFN-\u03c9 in cats that were pretreated with rFeIFN-\u03c9 before challenge with FHV-1 was investigated [84]. Unexpectedly, no beneficial effects were observed in these cats. Ballin et al. [85] reported a similar finding; they found that compared to a control group treated with a placebo, cats treated with rFeIFN-\u03c9 did not exhibit improved clinical signs of acute viral feline upper respiratory tract disease despite having lower FCV copy numbers than cats receiving rFeIFN-\u03c9 [85]. More studies are needed to verify that rFeIFN-\u03c9 has a therapeutic effect in vivo.",

Furthermore, according to the half maximal inhibitory concentration, rFeIFN-\u03c9 was more potent than rHuIFN-\u03b1 in inhibiting reverse transcriptase activity.

Furthermore, FIV coinfection was found to occur in 7% of FeLV-infected cats [91]. Previous studies showed that rFeIFN-\u03c9 significantly decreased clinical scores and rates of mortality, and improved abnormal hematologic parameters (red blood cell count, packed cell volume, and white blood cell count) in virus-infected cats [45]. These studies demonstrated that rFeIFN-\u03c9 had significant therapeutic effects on clinical signs. Evidence also showed that an effective immune modulation in FIV-cats could be obtained by treating them orally with rFeIFN-\u03c9. In a previous study [45], FIV-infected cats that were orally administered rFeIFN-\u03c9 at a dose of 0.1 MU/cat gained weight, although no dramatic changes were obtained regarding viral loads and the CD4+/CD8+ ratio. However, this study did not assess any clinical benefits [45]. Recently, oral protocols were also used to administer rFeIFN-\u03c9 in naturally FIV-infected cats, and initial clinical scores were obtained that were similar to those obtained using the licensed subcutaneous protocol [92]. Interestingly, similar to the use of the licensed protocol, rFeIFN-\u03c9 also induced a significant clinical improvement of cats that were treated orally, despite viral excretion, while there were no significant variations in acute-phase proteins [92]. These results suggest that oral administration of rFeIFN-\u03c9 can be an effective alternative therapy for FIV-infected cats.",

However, until now, no antiviral drugs have been licensed to cure cats of CPxV infection. A recent study conducted by McInerney et al. [101] showed that treatment with rFeIFN-\u03c9 had a certain protective effect in cats infected with CPxV, although two of the four cats in the study died. Nevertheless, rFeIFN-\u03c9 may be potentially useful for treating CPxV-associated pneumonia and dermatitis in cats. Of note, additional research is needed before this can be confirmed.",

Fortunately, a study showed that treating dogs with CAD with subcutaneously administered rFeIFN-\u03c9 had a comparable efficacy to orally-administered cyclosporin [105]. In later studies [106], oral IFN therapy showed higher efficacy than the subcutaneous treatment in terms of the Canine Atopic Dermatitis Extent and Severity Index and total scores, although the improvement of pruritus and quality of life scores were not significant; however, in this study, serum antibodies against rFeIFN-\u03c9 were not detected in any of the dogs.",

Previous studies showed that IFN-\u03c9 is a beneficial therapy in FIP-infected cats. However, these studies used fewer than 12 cats per group and did not include a control group. Furthermore, the effect of IFN-\u03c9 was not reliably confirmed in FIP [108], [109]. For instance, in a study of cats suspected of having FIP, 12 cats were treated with 106 U/kg of feline FeIFN-\u03c9 every other day until remission, followed by injections every week; four of the 12 cats lived longer than 2 years [108]. In a subsequent study conducted by Ritz et al. [109], a control group was used, but there were no significant differences between the survival times of cats treated with FeIFN-\u03c9 and a placebo, although the FeIFN-\u03c9 treatment resulted in a significantly lower lymphocyte count. Interestingly, one cat survived > 3 months in the FeIFN-\u03c9 group. These results suggest that FeIFN-\u03c9 could also have a certain therapeutic effect in FIP-infected cats.",

Although rFeIFN-\u03c9 has only been registered to treat CPV, FeLV, and FIV infections, it shows comparable efficacy when used to treat other viral infections or diseases. However, its safety (e.g., toxicity and side effects) when used at a high dose has not been investigated extensively. In addition, the antiviral activity of IFN-\u03c9 in some fatal infectious diseases also needs to be evaluated. In our laboratory, we confirmed the antiviral activities of IFN-\u03c9 against foot and mouth disease virus (not published yet), although these antiviral activities in other viral infections remain to be investigated, and further studies are very important for evaluating its efficacy in more animal models and ultimately in human trials.",
