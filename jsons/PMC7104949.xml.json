They tend to originate within a country and severely affect the associated population, often causing detrimental effects. With rapid increases in international and overseas travel because of globalization and developments in transportation, there is a greater likelihood of worldwide spread of newly emerging infectious diseases [2]. One of the well-known newly emerging infectious diseases of the 21st century, that had a global effect, was severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). It began in China, from where it spread to 29 countries, resulting in 8,422 cases and 916 deaths, worldwide [3]. Other examples include novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) that originated in Mexico in 2009, Ebola in Guinea in 2013, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012.",

Moreover, 91.8% of healthcare providers in Saudi Arabia, nearly half of them nurses, were found to have a negative attitude toward treating patients with suspected or confirmed MERS [9]. As MERS-related deaths began to be reported, levels of anxiety and stress increased, mainly because of the possibility of involuntary placement and dispatch to other front-line areas with a workforce shortage. Moreover, if healthcare workers involved in the management of cases are infected or die, there is a higher probability of workers avoiding suspected cases [10].",

In the context of newly emerging infectious diseases, nursing intention is of paramount importance in overcoming these diseases. Without proper provisions of medical care, infectious diseases are easily distributed and may cause detrimental effects that are avoidable if appropriately managed. Abrupt resignation of nurses because of stress that developed during an epidemic of an infectious disease not only causes a workforce shortage, but also maximizes the distress of other remaining medical personnel by influencing the overall workplace atmosphere. In addition, based on a previous research finding [12] that showed how professionalism in nursing influenced nursing intention, it is necessary to evaluate nursing intention with regard to professionalism as well. Therefore, in this study, it was hypothesized that nurses' intention to respond to possible future instances of infectious disease may not only be associated with prior outbreak nursing experience, but also their stress at the time of the outbreak and professionalism in nursing. To evaluate not only the effect of the outbreak experience but also the role at the time, we developed the following study objectives. The aims of the present study were as follows: (1) to examine levels of stress and professionalism of nurses who provided nursing care during the 2015 South Korean MERS outbreak according to their experience, (2) to investigate the nurses' intentions to respond to possible future infectious disease outbreaks in relation to their experience during the outbreak, and (3) to determine the relationship between nursing intention and experience during the outbreak considering stress and professionalism.",

The fact that a significantly higher proportion of head nurses were included in the firsthand group might partly explain the result. It has been reported that professionalism in nursing was correlated significantly with experience as a registered nurse and age [19]. In addition, there was a significant positive association between nursing intention and professionalism in nursing in the present study. It might be more difficult to interpret this relation in the same way as the above because the relationship between professionalism in nursing and clinical experience or age is complicated when providing nursing care for patients with newly developed infectious diseases. In fact, there was a significant difference in the mean nursing intention score between the groups according to years of clinical experience, but there was no significant difference within the groups and no proportional relationship between years of clinical experience and nursing intention was observed in this study. In addition, the highest mean nursing intention score was detected among nurses aged \u226550 years in the secondhand group. A previous study reported that years in nursing and having dependent children were negatively correlated with nurses' intention to respond to bioterrorism or other infectious disease emergencies, such as pandemic influenza, and the level of intention was higher in scenarios where the infection risk was lower [22]. This indicates that nurses make decision to respond during an outbreak based on a variety of information sources. Moreover, it has been reported that the level of professionalism is lowest among nurses employed at public hospitals compared with nurses employed at private or university hospitals [23]. Although the present study did not compare the level of professionalism between public hospital nurses and nurses employed at private or university hospitals, our findings did indicate that the level of professionalism differs even among public hospitals according to hospital authorized type. How well hospitals, which play a vital role in patient care and management during the epidemic, are supported and systematically managed is associated with the development of additional cases. Therefore, along with the present study results that revealed possible associations of nursing intention with hospital authorized type and goods supply condition, it can be suggested that designating hospitals as infection management and control centers and providing appropriate education and resources are important to enhance nurses' levels of professionalism. Further studies conducted at private or university hospitals regarding the issue are required.",

A previous study reported that workload and emotional issues related to death and dying are major perceived stressors of nurses [24]. The findings of this study revealed no significant differences in stress between nurses according to experience during the outbreak. Although not significantly different, the level of stress was higher among nurses with firsthand experience of caring for MERS patients. The highest stress score, 45.00, was detected in one nurse with isolation experience who did not treat MERS patients closely. It was about 10 points higher than nurses with the same experience who had had close contact with MERS patients. This finding implies that the level of stress is not only affected by the isolation experience itself, but also by the whole experience of outbreak nursing. Although not enough studies have been performed to establish the safety of healthcare workers isolated for infection control, previous studies revealed that patients isolated for infection control experienced more preventable adverse events and expressed greater dissatisfaction with their treatment [25].",

First, the evaluation of stress during the MERS outbreak was based on a retrospective survey; hence, the actual level of stress during the outbreak could have been overestimated or underestimated. Second, because there is no comparative data about nursing professionalism before and after experiencing the MERS outbreak, the study cannot determine whether the MERS event actually influenced nursing professionalism. Third, only some nurses employed at selected local public hospitals were included in the study; studies including all nurses who experienced the outbreak are required. Fourth, because the questionnaire used in the study was based on previously designed questionnaires and was modified for its purposes, it might have influenced the study result. Last, the study hospitals were sampled conventionally; thus, generalization of the present study findings is limited. Despite these limitations, the major strengths of this study include its investigation of nurses' intention to respond to possible future infectious disease outbreaks and its examination of the stress and professionalism status of nurses who experienced the 2015 MERS outbreak, which caused massive loss of human lives in South Korea.
