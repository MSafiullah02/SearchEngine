            "text": "Zooplankton constitute a diverse assemblage of microscopic organisms that occupy a crucial intermediate position in the food webs of freshwater, estuarine, and marine ecosystems. In transferring energy from primary producers (photosynthetic protists, bacteria, and single-celled plants) to macroscopic invertebrates and fishes, zooplankton have the capacity to shape the dynamics of entire ecosystems. Zooplankton tend to be well adapted for long-range dispersal via a wide range of natural vectors (e.g., airborne resting eggs, aquatic birds, coastal currents\u2014C\u00e1ceres & Soluk, 2002; Frisch et al., 2007), but anthropogenic activities such as aquaculture, commercial shipping, and recreational boating now provide an unprecedented capacity for dispersal across large geographic distances (Carlton & Geller, 1993; Ruiz et al., 2000; Minchin, 2007). Accordingly, non-indigenous zooplankton are now reported from bodies of water across nearly every region of the globe, and in many cases have been associated with far ranging ecological and economic impacts (Pimentel et al., 2005; Gollasch 2006; Connelly et al., 2007; Cuhel & Aguilar, 2013).",

This includes a large number of new invasions like the introduction of the mysid Hemimysis anomala G.O. Sars, 1907 (Pothoven et al., 2007), the copepod Thermocyclops crassus (Fischer, 1853) (Connolly et al., 2017), and the rotifer Brachionus leydigii Cohn, 1862 (Connolly et al., 2018) to the North American Great Lakes. Furthermore, some high-profile invaders have greatly expanded their range in recent decades. This includes the western expansion of zebra and quagga mussels (which exhibit planktonic larvae) across the continental United States (Nalepa & Schloesser, 2013) and the spread of the Ctenophore Mnemiospis leidyi A. Agassiz, 1865, to the Baltic Sea and adjacent waters (Hansson, 2006; Javidpour, 2006). Finally, a number of theoretical and technical developments have also shifted research interests and paradigms in recent decades. This includes a growing interest in the ecological consequences of climate change (Hoegh-Guldberg & Bruno, 2010; Li et al., 2011; Chapman, 2014), a decrease in the financial and technological barriers to genetic sequencing (Glenn, 2011; Peterson et al., 2012; Schl\u00f6tterer et al., 2014), and an increased awareness of the role that disease may play in shaping zooplankton communities (Ebert, 2005; Decaestecker et al., 2007; Sommer et al., 2012; C\u00e1ceres et al., 2014).",

This survey updates and expands upon the prior work of Bollens et al. (2002), with an increased focus on identifying taxonomic and geographic trends across the literature. This survey is intended to provide a concise summary of the manner in which the scientific community has allocated its efforts to this issue in recent decades and to illuminate trends that emerge from the literature. We do not here present a detailed synthesis of the findings contained in these articles, nor do we undertake a meta-analysis of the data contained therein. Instead, our survey has been organized around five fundamental questions: Who, what, where, when, and why? Who are the non-indigenous zooplankton species represented in the literature? What aspects of introduction and invasion are being studied? Where are introductions being reported? When are these patterns different? Why do we observe these patterns? Finally, we conclude our review with a set of recommendations for future research based upon the answers to these questions.",

Of all the surveyed articles which contained a field-based component, 61% (328 of 536) pertained to freshwater systems, with a large fraction of these studies occurring in the North American Great Lakes. The remainder of the studies were evenly divided among estuaries (16%), brackish seas (12%), and marine systems (10%).

Three topics frequently arose in the publications that we surveyed: distribution and range, community impacts, and populations dynamics. Of the articles that we surveyed, 193 (31%) concerned the distribution and/or range of non-indigenous taxa, 157 (25%) reported on the community impacts of non-indigenous taxa, and 132 (21%) reported on population dynamics of non-indigenous taxa.

In their earlier review, Bollens et al. (2002) reported a striking underutilization of genetic tools in the study of zooplankton invasions. Across the subsequent 18-year period that we reviewed, we report a slight increase in the number of publications with a genetic component, but far below what might be expected given the dramatic reduction in cost and the increased accessibility of genetic sequencing platforms in recent years (Glenn, 2011; Peterson et al., 2012; Goodwin et al., 2016). We found that only 7% of surveyed articles included a genetic component, with 8 publications on the metabarcoding of organisms in ballast water, 21 publications on invasion history, and 11 publications concerning species identification and/or taxonomy. Note that the apparent rapid increase in the number of publications with a genetic component (Fig. 4F) is driven by an unusually large value in 2018 alone. This may represent the beginning of an upward trend, or simply an outlying value. Nearly all reviewed genetic studies employed a small set of genetic markers such as cytochrome oxidase 1 (COI) or internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1), with only a few publications employing next-generation sequencing methods (Ghabooli et al., 2016; Dexter et al., 2018; Scott et al., 2018). Given the power of these tools to reconstruct the demographic history of populations (Estoup & Guillemaud, 2010), the maturation of eDNA technologies and protocols (Taberlet et al., 2012), and the constantly decreasing cost of implementation (Peterson et al., 2012), genetic and genomic tools represent a particularly promising area for growth within the field of invasion biology.",

Parasites and other pathogenic organisms have the capacity to act as major drivers of zooplankton population dynamics (Ebert, 2005; C\u00e1ceres et al., 2014). In recent years, there has been a growing appreciation for the role that disease may play in shaping seasonal dynamics of plankton communities (Sommer et al., 2012) and the evolution of local populations (Decaestecker et al., 2007; Ebert, 2008). It has been suggested that escape from pathogenic organisms may play a role in the invasion process (Mack et al., 2000), and in some cases, the rapid decline of an invader has been attributed to the subsequent arrival of pathogens and parasites from its native range (Simberloff & Gibbons, 2004). Invaders may also serve as vectors for the introduction of new parasites to native fauna (Mack et al., 2000; Grigorovich et al., 2001). Despite this wide-ranging set of consequences, our survey contained only 4 publications that examined some aspect of disease among non-indigenous zooplankton. This is clearly a facet of zooplankton invasions which merits greater investigation.",

In the most well-known example, zebra and quagga mussels (which disperse via planktonic larvae) have affected dramatic changes to water clarify and nutrient cycling, and markedly transformed benthic substrate across the invaded North American Great Lakes (Macisaac, 1996; Cuhel & Aguilar, 2013). While this may represent an extreme case, ecosystem impacts of similar scale have been reported across other species and waterbodies (Kideys et al., 2008; Penk et al., 2015; Walsh et al., 2016) and may be far more common than presently known (Simberloff, 2011). However, we observed that only a small percentage of the publications that we surveyed (4.0%) explicitly examined ecosystem-level impacts of non-indigenous zooplankton. As surveys of public attitudes regarding non-indigenous species have shown that general ecosystem impacts are a primary concern of public stakeholders (Garc\u00eda-Llorente et al., 2008), we strongly recommend that researchers consider ecosystem-scale processes and impacts in future work.",

A number of observational studies, laboratory experiments, and modeling efforts indicate that climate change may promote the global spread of invasive species and increased severity of invasion impacts (e.g., Lennon et al., 2001; Stachowicz et al., 2002; Winder et al., 2011; Chapman et al., 2016). Although many of the publications that we reviewed referenced climate change in some manner, we identified only 7 publications that explicitly tested hypotheses pertaining to climate\u2013invasion linkages. This may be a consequence of the long periods of observation needed to detect climate signals in field-based studies, or the complex relationship between temperature and plankton community dynamics.

Our review highlights that fact that much of the current scientific understanding of zooplankton invasions is based upon a relatively small number of taxa and waterbodies. Our survey shows a potential need for greater examination of the waters associated with less economically developed nations, especially at tropical latitudes. Furthermore, we highlight considerable opportunity for growth in the areas of genetics, disease, ecosystem impacts, and climate\u2013invasion linkages. We hope that this review will serve as a point of reference for the research community and a roadmap for the planning of future investigations.",
