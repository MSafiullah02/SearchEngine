Societal response to COVID-19 is reminiscent of the Ebola outbreak in 2013-2014 whereby the media, political discourse, medical and public health journals provided headlines regularly orchestrating an aura of urgency. Dedication and organization of resources with emergency allocation of $6.2 billion dollars to address the outbreak were immediate. Acute infectious epidemics with marked case fatality ignite fear with consequential demand for stringent public health measures, particularly early on before the scientific community is better able to establish the epidemiology, categorize risk, and arrive at considered interventions.",

While government and public health agencies assume immediate, active and principal responsibility for the eradication of CD outbreaks, those affected with diabetes and other NCDs are required to take primary responsibility for managing their condition. From a political perspective, government officials loathe to accept responsibility for failures resulting from inadequate responses to highly contagious infectious processes given the relatively short-term nature of election cycles. In contrast, NCDs with delayed, long-term consequences defy individual political attribution. Furthermore, diabetes may be viewed as a lifestyle disorder determined by the exercise of individual free will often resulting in unhealthy choices, although this viewpoint defies the complex interplay between environment and genetic predisposition. Hence, these various factors coalesce and provide insight into why NCDs do not elicit the same public outcry or daily prime time headlines.",

            "text": "NCDs by far constitute the leading cause of premature deaths globally, accounting for over 70 per cent with 41 million individuals dying annually including 15 million under the age of 70 years [4], [5]. The preponderance of these occurs in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where surveillance and treatment of NCDs are often inadequate [5]. The majority of deaths are potentially preventable, but the progress towards this goal has been slowed by inadequate government commitment, investment, engagement and accountability with measures to reduce NCDs [6]. Notably, since the first United Nations High-Level Meeting on Prevention and Control of NCDs in 2011, the global response has been patchy and inadequate in targeting Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), committed to by 193 countries in 2015, to reduce premature mortality from NCDs by one-third by 2030 [7], [8]. While adoption of NCD policies has slowly increased, countries have implemented under half of these [9]. Only 20% of NCD alliance members were reported on course to meet NCD targets, 18% having sufficient accountability measures to ensure achieving stipulated goals while a quarter of countries do not have a national NCD plan [4]. This inertia has been compounded by limited funding for public health in relation to total health expenditures. The public health allocation of total health expenditures, while increasing from 1.36% to 3.18% between 1960 and 2002, declined to 2.65% in 2014 with further projected decrease to 2.40% in 2023 [10]. Indeed, U.S. public health and prevention expenditures in 2018 represented less than three percent of the $3.6 trillion annual healthcare spending potentially adversely affecting preparedness for existing as well as novel health threats [11].",

Diabetes occurred in 8.2% of 1,590 Chinese patients hospitalized with COVID-19 with a mean age of 48.9 years and a higher rate (34.6%) reported in those with a composite endpoint comprising ICU admission, ventilator requirement and death.

These observations, having special relevance for diabetes prevention, are reminiscent of Rose\u2019s formulation published in 1985 that broadly targeted public health interventions involving small, individual lifestyle changes can produce considerable collective benefit in a total population, particularly when the risk is highly diffused as with diabetes, than large changes in a small segment of the population [13].

Counseling to change behavior and reduce NCD risk, especially in high-risk patients, is also highly cost-effective [5].
