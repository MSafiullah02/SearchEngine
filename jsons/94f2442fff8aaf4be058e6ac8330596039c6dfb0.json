Just 30 days after ProMed's post, on 29 January, 6,065 confirmed COVID-19 cases had been notified worldwide, mainly from China, where all 1,239 severe cases and 132 COVID-19 deaths were reported. At that point, only 68 cases had been identified in 15 countries outside mainland China, all of which had a link to China or to cases from China [3] (Figure) . By 28 February, 30 days later, 83,652 confirmed COVID-19 cases had been reported from 51 countries on all continents. Countries outside mainland China still accounted for only 4.5% (n = 3,664) of the notified cases with some, including Italy, Germany, and France in Europe, already experiencing limited autochthonous transmission. From late February, new infections in China declined rapidly after the implementation of sweeping social distancing measures, while attention turned to Europe, the new epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic. Italy was initially the country hit the hardest by far, Spain, the Netherlands and others followed;",

Cases with a link to Italy and neighbouring regions of Austria were detected in a number of European countries in February and early March, often linked to tourists returning from skiing holidays [6] . Outside Europe, Iran faced a rapid surge of COVID-19 followed by exportation of cases mostly to countries in the Middle East but also overseas [7] . More recently, the United States in North America, and in Europe the United Kingdom emerged as new epidemic hotspots with 124,655 cases plus 2,191 fatalities and 17,089 cases plus 1,019 fatalities, respectively, reported by 29 March, day 90 after the ProMed post [3] . Recently, increasing case numbers have also been seen in Africa and in Asian countries outside China that had not been affected early in the pandemic. On 8 April, day 100 after ProMed's 'request for information', 1,391,890 cases including 81,478 fatalities have been reported from more than 200 countries/territories worldwide and only few countries appear to have passed the peak.",

A number of studies in various settings determined the basic reproductive number R 0 to be within the range of 2-3 [9, 10] ; the incubation period was determined as ranging from 1 to 14 days with an average of 5-6 days; transmission through droplets was established as the main mode of transmission; the clinical picture that emerged included a wide range from mild symptoms with fever, sore throat and cough to severe pneumonias with characteristic features on computed tomography scans; in Hubei, China, up to 13.8% of laboratory-confirmed patients had severe disease, 6.1% were critically ill and the case fatality rate among all COVID-19 cases was 2.3% [11] .",

Laboratory experiments provided data on the survival of the virus on different surfaces [14] . Aside from people older than 70 years, severe and fatal cases were seen particularly in men and people with hypertension, diabetes, underlying pulmonary diseases and in smokers. Children were shown to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 [15] , however, the role of children in disease transmission still needs to be fully elucidated.",

Clinical trials are being conducted worldwide to investigate treatment options with a variety of antiviral and other drugs.

            "text": "The WHO declared COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on 30 January and a pandemic on 11 March [18, 19] . In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, countries worldwide have taken to a wide range of measures, initially to contain and later to mitigate its impact. The current goal is primarily to limit the spread of the virus through physical distancing i.e. lowering contact rates in order to gain time for preparing critical services such as healthcare for a high demand [20] . Reducing exposure also aims to protect the most vulnerable population groups and healthcare workers in the absence of a vaccine and specific treatment. In Europe, measures have comprised closure of borders, closure of educational institutions such as schools, nurseries and universities, closure of museums and theatres, closure of shops and restaurants, restriction of movement and suspension of public gatherings even with small groups of people, and lockdown of whole countries. Obviously, these measures have a far-reaching impact on individuals and society as a whole and they were taken at different times and on a different scale depending on the countries' epidemiological, geographical, political and societal situation. The COVID-19 pandemic has posed a number of public health challenges and some vulnerabilities in health sector preparedness have become evident. In times of public health emergencies, setting research priorities and conducting research risks duplication of efforts, and strong coordinating mechanisms and oversight are necessary to avoid this. Further, timely communication and conveying uncertainties are a recurrent challenge for public health and policymakers. Informed risk communication, streamlining of messages and collaboration with the media play an important role in mitigating the impact of any public health crisis. A new challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic is how to identify the right moment and determine the correct means for escalation and de-escalation of measures taken at a scale that was beyond imagination for many only months ago. While there will be common principles such as timeliness, proportionality and acceptability of measures, there will most probably not be one gold standard solution for all and the approaches will need to be flexible and responsive. Only the future can show which strategies and measures were most successful in curbing the pandemic.",
