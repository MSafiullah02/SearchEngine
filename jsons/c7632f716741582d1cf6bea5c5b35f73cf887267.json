Thus, the difference between current out-of-hospital survival rate (5-15%) and the potential survival rate is unacceptable. There is still no solution for shortening the critical time between a sudden cardiac arrest event (in 2/3 of cases occurring at patient's home [6] ), and the time of the arrival of the professional first aid at the scene. Ornato [7] reports that: \"To the best of our knowledge, no city has been able to provide defibrillation for the majority of out of hospital cardiac arrest victims within 5 minutes of the recognition of the event\". Thus, the bystander's role as the initiator of basic CPR is irreplaceable and advanced means should be developed for automatic, mobile, user friendly, CPR devices.",

Krischer explained the failure of SCV-CPR as follows: Krischer also reported that the time until intubation in the SCV-CPR group was longer (median of 4 minutes) than the standard group (median of 3 minutes). Holmberg 4 analyzed survival rate (one month) within a population of 2748 cardiac arrest patients, as a function of the time to first defibrillation. Mathematical interpolation of Holmberg's report suggests that a delay of one minute, between the third to the fourth minute (as reported by Krischer) reduces the survival rate in 5%, whereas, a delay from fourth to fifth minute decreases the survival rate in 3%.",

Therefore, ventilation parameters during VICM (i.e., peak inspiratory pressure, negative expiratory pressure, inspiratory time, tidal volume) should be kept within the range of the acceptable limits considered as safe, to ensure minimal risk of GI. Means to ensure this are automatically maintaining the mean airway pressure lower than the lower oesophageal sphincter (LES) pressure, using a high frequency waveform and adjusting the duty-cycle characteristics. The negative airway pressure used at the VICM can have a further role at maintaining a minimal air volume inside the oesophagus.

It is therefore that fluid management of the critically ill is still a challenge, and, most probably, a source of frequent errors. Although fluid loading is one of the most common therapeutic decisions in the ICU, only 50% of the patients do respond to it by increasing their CO. The unnecessary fluid administration in the other half of our patients may be harmful, as positive fluid balance has been repeatedly shown to be associated with increased morbidity and mortality in critically ill pateints.

The main hemodynamic effect of the increase in intrathoracic pressure during the mechanical breath is a transient decrease in right ventricular filling, leading eventually to a decrease in LV stroke output and to a decrease in arterial pressure (dDown).

For all these parameters, values above 10-13% indicate, with very high sensitivity and specificity, that fluid loading will cause an increase in CO.

In these conditions one has to rely solely on 'preload' parameters, preferably volumetric ones. In addition, variations in the LV stroke output are greatly exagerrated by large tidal volumes (and by air-trapping or reduced chest wall compliance), and are relatively insensitive in the presence of low ones. Another point that may have been underestimated so far is the fact that the SPV, SVV and PPV, include the dUp component as well, a componenet that is unrelated to fluid-responsiveness. This augmentation in LV stroke volume is quite prevalent in critically ill patients, and may reduce the sensitivity and specificity of these parameters (especially when they are in mid-range).",

However, when we use any of these functional hemodynamic parameters we have to remember the following general principles: We are often confronted with a variety of static parameters that do not provide a conclusive picture. Challenging the system with a standardized stimulus may provide new insights about the function of the whole system.

However, ultraviolet light is not applicable to in vivo spectrometry because it damages DNA.

The near infrared is the most useful region for in vivo spectrometry. However, water strongly absorbs light in the near-infrared region with a wavelength longer than 1200 nm.

The additional three wavelengths are used for the detection of venous pulsation and patient movement, which cause errors in SpO2 values. (2) Oesophageal photoplethysmography: Although pulse oximetry requires adequate peripheral perfusion to operate accurately, conventional sensors must be attached to the most peripheral parts of the body where pulsatile flow is most easily diminished. This drawback is lessened when the sensor is used for monitoring a better perfused central part of the body. The mid-oesophagus is one of the most promising candidates. (3) Fluorescence spectrometry: As the majority of biological tissue constituents do not fluoresce, a fluorescent substance may be selected using this technique. Moreover, fluorescence is usually observed in the ultraviolet or short visible light regions, and compounds fluorescing red or infrared light can therefore be analysed using this method. ICG is one such molecule which emits infrared light with a wavelength of 830 nm when it is excited by incident light with a wavelength of 775 nm.

This polysynaptic sympathetic system, mediated by alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, innervates the radicular fibers of the iris muscles and dilates the pupil.",

Larson and colleagues have demonstrated that alfentanil does not diminish the light reflex but blocks the reflex pupil dilation in response to noxious stimulation and reported a good correlation between plasma alfentanil concentration and magnitude of pupil dilation [8] . Dilation was reduced to 50% of control values at alfentanil concentrations around 20 ng\u00b7ml \u22121 , and was almost abolished at concentrations approaching 100 ng\u00b7ml \u22121 [8] .

            "text": "Conclusions: If pupil size cannot help the anaesthesiologist to evaluate the depth of analgesia, the pupil reflex dilation in response to a standard noxious stimulus could help the anaesthesiologist to quantify the level of epidural or opioid analgesia during general anaesthesia. However, the relation between pupil reflex dilation to a noxious stimulus and the opioid concentration is limited because no pupil dilation is observed at very high opioid concentrations. Consequently, pupil dilation to a noxious stimulus could only be a sensitive measure of low or moderate opioid analgesia in the daily clinical practice. In the future, the relationship between pupil reactivity and adequacy of preoperative and postoperative analgesia must be studied on a larger scale. Moreover, other studies are required to evaluate the relationship between pupil reflex dilation and analgesia in some particular clinical conditions such as in elderly patients or patients tolerant to opioids. In 1972, Warner Slack wrote, \"Doctors as interviewers are busy, expensive, and sometimes hard to find. It seems reasonable, therefore, to look for substitutes that will serve at least some of the purposes of medical interviewing in widespread and inexpensive ways. One possible substitute is the computer, programmed as an interviewer.\" Now, more than a generation later (thirty-two years), the wisdom of Warner's observation has been confirmed countless times in numerous studies, but it is fair to say that patient-computer interviewing has not been widely adopted and is in daily use in only a few isolated settings. On the other hand, it is no longer simply the elusive and expensive nature of the physician that motivates adoption of computer interviewing. Numerous recent studies have also shown that widespread adoption of computerized record keeping will make health care safer and permit more effective health care cost management. Patient computer interviewing is inevitably a part of automated record keeping in medicine. And finally, whereas in 1972, the Internet was simply a gleam in the eye of researchers at DARPA, it is now on every desktop.",

Today, in contrast, fibre-optic skills can be counted in the core skills of anaesthesia and should feature in any initial training program. Those without this skill may be deterred from learning by its association with difficult or impossible airway control, the expensive and sophisticated, but vulnerable equipment involved, and lastly with the potential for transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Training opportunities for those who have missed out are available in many departments, and are evident in workshops and special sessions provided as part of small and large national and international meetings.

Ohm's law, U = RI explains the principle (U being the potential difference between the poles of the nerve stimulator or the voltage output; R, expressed in Ohm's being the impedance of the body and the circuit or the impedance of an external electrical circuit; I being the current). When the impedance varies the current is maintained constant by modifying the voltage output. Each device has the capacity to a greater or lesser degree to keep the current constant. During testing, as the impedance of the external electrical circuit increased, the rise and decay times were progressively greater than before. Beyond a noted limit (maximum load output measured at 5 mA, if possible) for each device, the current could no longer stay constant and the effective current decreased, no longer corresponding to the displayed current. For some devices, considerable deformations in the waveform lead to disappearance of the plateau. It is of great relevance to have a high, but not excessive, voltage output. Ergonomics and safety: A nerve stimulator needs to be easy to handle and robust with a weak bulk. The double function, neuromuscular blockade monitor and nerve stimulator, is not desirable. The ergonomics, the reliability of connections, easily identifiable polarities, the quality of cables, the range of alarms (e.g. circuit closure, battery, high impedance. . .), the audible and visible nature of these alarms, the display of effective current and the display of the selected duration are all considered to be important. The dial needs to be perfectly balanced. A rotating dial is more ergonomic than up and down buttons. Most of the devices offered a choice between at least two output frequencies, 1 Hz or 2 Hz that is one impulse or two impulses per second. The quality of cables was variable. For the polarities, the colour coding was not always easily identifiable with black for the negative pole and red for the positive. The nerve stimulators were all more or less well equipped in terms of safety signals, audio and visual alarms. The possibility to choose from many predefined signal durations should be accompanied by a safety display guaranteeing the selected choice. Only the newest devices displayed the signal duration on the screen.",

Adjustment of the voltage output is needed to maintain a constant current during an increase in impedance of the external electrical circuit. Nerve stimulators have improved not only in their signal form and precision but also in the linear variation of the current, the maintenance of current stability during the increase in impedance of the external electrical circuit and the possibility to choose between many predefined durations of signal [8] . However, a recent series of tests outlined imprecisions in current at values \u22640.5 mA in the majority of devices. Furthermore, the durations used were different depending on which device was tested. These authors suggested it would be desirable to require standardization of the features when manufacturing nerve stimulators [9] .

            "text": "The nerve stimulator can be used akin to radar, a guide in the search for the nerve. According to Coulomb's law, the electric field produced for a current of constant duration is inversely proportional to the square of the distance. Our aim is to bring the needle tip as near as possible to the nerve through the progressive diminution in stimulation intensity. On the other hand, a very high intensity is needed once the needle tip is some distance from the nerve. These facts underscore the importance of devices with a digital display, precision and linear variation in the delivered current. The minimal stimulating current necessary to produce an effective block remains unknown. Many works have addressed the importance of the minimal stimulating current. This was a predictive criterion of failure in brachial canal blocks performed in one series of 1417 patients [10] . In volunteers, undergoing 4 sciatic blocks by the posterior popliteal approach, the motor responses provoked by nerve stimulation correlated with the results of the block [11] . For some authors [12] , the qualitative result of a nerve block will depend more on the minimal current than the type of motor response obtained during the search. Certainly, this minimal current plays an important role [13] [14] [15] [16] . In studies of morbidity, adherence to a safety threshold of 0.5 mA has been proposed [17, 18] . However, this proposition is not based on objective data, especially as the impulse duration is rarely specified. It seems dangerous to try to associate the risk of neural injury only with a figure of intensity whatever that may be. The nerve stimulators available have a duration of stimulation between 40 and 1000 \u00b5s. Depending on the nerve stimulator used, the charge for a current of 0.5 mA will vary from 20 to 500 nC. In the literature a number of authors have opted for values of 0.1 to 0.5 mA (often forgetting to denote the duration of stimulation). The minimal stimulating current can be defined as the value below which an adapted muscular response is no longer obtained after a search within the three axes of the space [5, 19] . This threshold, insufficient for a 100% success rate, is an essential criterion in giving an estimation of needle position. As a consequence, the systematic search for this value may allow a diminution of the risk of neural lesion [20] . In a review article on the practice of brachial plexus anaesthesia, it was suggested that the final current should be less than 0.5 mA and values of 0.3 mA were proposed to further improve success rates [21] . Although this point of view is not unanimously held [22, 23] , for patients without polyneuropathy, safety and success seemed to be obtained at a current of about 0.3 mA at a pulse width of 100 \u00b5s [24] .",

The best discrimination of distance between needle and nerve has been shown in practice. For an impulse with a current of 0.3 mA applied for a short duration the needle tip has been shown to be closer to the nerve in comparison to a long duration [24] . In the course of the technology evolution, the standard duration of stimulation has decreased 10-fold from 1000 to 100 \u00b5s.

By locating nerves more easily, the longer impulses (300 \u00b5s) may shorten the performance time for axillary blocks when using a multistimulation technique [25] . For a sensory nerve, a stimulus of long duration can aid the initial search. A\u00df fibres, afferent skin receptors, have conduction velocities, which can approximate motor fibres. This could explain how low intensities applied for short durations during the final search for a sensory nerve are able to elicit rhythmic paresthesia when using the nerve stimulator [26, 27] . This debate between eliciting paresthesia and nerve stimulation is far from closed. Recent studies have attempted again to compare the subjectivity of the search for paresthesia with the objectivity of a motor response obtained with a nerve stimulator [28] [29] [30] . The chronology of events at the time of approach to the nerve with the help of a nerve stimulator will be above all the obtaining of a motor response, then the appearance of an electrical paresthesia which disappears with the stopping of the nerve stimulation and finally in the case of direct contact the obtaining of a mechanical paresthesia. Moreover, as part of a systematic approach to the administration of local anaesthetics the reappearance of a muscular contraction is linked to the increase in charge, which in turn depends on its current intensity and duration. For the same charge in nC, the motor response is more intense with the use of a short duration. This is why it is necessary to indicate every time the signal duration for a given current (mA) or charge (nC).",

Beyond a certain limit, the device cannot guarantee a constant current and the effective intensity decreases and no longer corresponds to the intensity displayed. The more the voltage output can be elevated, the better the device performs in critical situations. Some authors have suggested that a high voltage can provoke a sensation of burning through the local production of heat, in particular if one uses a dry electrode at the positive pole [31] . This point remains controversial and has not been observed in practice [32] . The maximal load output can be maintained close to 15 kilohms for the best nerve stimulators. Even in these extreme conditions, the maximal voltage stays five times lower than for a neuromuscular blockade monitor, which can cause burns [33] .",

            "text": "Every user needs to know the characteristics of the nerve stimulator. It is essential to take account of its precision and weaknesses. The technological evolution in these devices has direct consequence in the way in which we proceed to obtain an accurate and safe search. The main advantages of newer devices concern signal quality, precision and linear variation of the current and several predetermined durations. To enhance the safety and success rate of nerve blocks using nerve stimulation, it seems useful to rely not on a single minimum current value but rather on combination of criteria [19, 20] . This should include the minimal current for a defined duration, the sensation of penetrating the relevant fascia, the type of muscular response obtained, the disappearance of a muscular contraction following the injection of 1 mL of agent, the ease of finding again this contraction by increasing once more the current, painless injection without resistance, etc. It is under these conditions that it will be possible on the one hand to improve further the risk-benefit ratio of nerve stimulation, and on the other hand to establish the predictive indicators of success that will enhance our practice. 18 Introduction: For years, it was commonly claimed that if an anaesthesiologist really knows the anatomy of a peripheral nerves, additional imaging is not required. This advice may contain elements of truth if one focuses only on surgical applications of regional blocks. The introduction of pain medicine into many practices, and the necessity of implanting devices and catheters for prolonged periods in patients, implicates that we further understand normal, as well as potentially altered, anatomy. Winnie once predicted: \"Sooner or later someone will make a sufficiently close examination of the anatomy involved, so that exact techniques will be developed\" [1] . Ultrasonography may represent such a method for providing a \"sufficiently close examination of the anatomy\". The ideal in the practice of regional anaesthesia would be to deliver precisely to the target nerve the local anaesthetic solution without incurring any risk of damage to the nerve or its related structures. We currently, use needles and catheters, guided mostly by the motor response to electrical nerve stimulation or, in the past, by the elicitation of paraesthesia. Unfortunately, this is essentially a blind process, and a modern imaging technique might be used to overcome this. Ultrasound has also been used to visualize the spread of the local anaesthetic solution and to validate currently used landmarks.",

            "text": "History: Ultrasound guided nerve blocks have been reported in the anaesthetic literature since 1978, with an increased interest from the mid 1990's, probably as a result of improvements in equipment. In 1978, La Grange et al. [2] reported the used of a Doppler ultrasound to improve identification of the subclavian vessels before brachial plexus block by the supraclavicular approach. Other authors [3] used Doppler ultrasound device to check for the localisation of the axillary artery when it was not palpable. In 1988, Vaghadia and Jenkins [4] described the use of Doppler ultrasound for intercostals nerve block. Ting and Sivagnanaratnam [5] in 1989, used ultrasound to confirm placement of a cannula in the axillary sheath and to document the spread of local the anaesthetic solution for upper limb surgery. In 1995, Guzeldemir and Ustunsoz [6] described the placement of a catheter under ultrasound guidance for continuous axillary brachial plexus blockade. Two ultrasound studies of the brachial plexus were published in 1998. It is also worth mentioning that ultrasound has been used to assess the depth of the epidural space [7] and to assess the lumbar epidural space during pregnancy [8] . In early 80, Cork et al. [9] and Currie et al. [7] observed a strong relationship between ultrasound location of the epidural space and the depth to the point of the epidural needle. Wallace et al. [10] found that ultrasonography was an useful means to detect the point of skin puncture. In 1995, Bonazzi et al. [11] valued ultrasonic measurements of epidural space depth as a useful diagnostic tool with a potential to decrease the complication rate.",

            "text": "When performing ultrasound guided infraclavicular block, Greher et al. [30] have often observed the optimal puncture site to be different from that predicted by the infraclavicular vertical brachial plexus block technique, indicating that the classical landmark can carries an inherent risk of complications. Knowledge of anatomy takes the needle to the general area of the nerve and helps avoiding other structures. The specific nerve localisation technique allows a close approach, hopefully without the risk of nerve damage. Most commonly, block failures result from imprecise needle placement, and even in skilful hands, the failure rate can be as high as 10-15% [15] . In fact, the key steps in any successful regional anesthetic technique involve: identifying the exact position of the nerve, placing precisely the needle, without damage to any adjacent structures, and finally carefully injecting local anesthetic. Most of the studies of ultrasound in regional anaesthetic practice have looked at one or more of the various approaches to the brachial plexus, some using ultrasound to identify and mark the skin over blood vessels and others using it to guide the needle or catheter to the nerve. Sheppard et al. [16] , while not specially describing ultrasound for nerve blocks, evaluated the ability of this technique to visualize components of the brachial plexus, using MRI as a guide to background anatomy. They described the plexus nerves as having a hypoechoic appearance, with thin hyperechoic rims which were tubular on longitudinal scans and oval to round on traverse scans. They also suggested that colour Doppler was essential to prevent the confusion of nerves with small blood vessels. As with tendons, the connective tissue within the nerves displays an anisotropic behaviour, depending on the angle of the emitted ultrasound wave relative to the long axis of the nerve [17] . In a study by Silvestri et al. [18] comparing the histologic structure with ultrasound echotexture of peripheral nerves, the hypoechoic components correspond to neuronal fascicles, and the hyperechoic areas correlate with the connective tissue layers forming the epineurium. Compared to nerves, vessels, tendons and muscles are also hypoechoic, whereas fat and bones are hyperechoic. In the transverse view, small vessels, lymph nodes and muscle fascicles can be mistaken for nerves because they have similar size and echogenicity. For this reason, they advocated the use of color doppler and electrical stimulation to determine the identity of the hypoechoic shadows, presumably nerves.",

            "text": "Modern ultrasound equipments typically operate in the 2.5-20 MHz frequency range. Higher the frequency is, better the spatial resolution is. Lower frequencies provide deeper penetration but at lower spatial resolution. Additional features, such as pulsed-wave and colour Doppler imaging, allow the identification of vessels and the blood velocities in those vessels. Ultrasound devices are now mobile, providing increased flexibility and applicability. Modern ultrasound equipments are cheaper and produce better quality imaging. Accordingly, the highest frequency is not automatically the best choice at all site of block performance. For example, in Perla's study [20] the 12 MHz probe provided higher resolution compared to lower frequency transducers in superficial plexus locations but failed to identify the nerves in 73% of the cases in the infraclavicular region, where they were easily identified with 5-10 MHz [30] . Different frequency probes will probably be needed for different purposes. For example, Greher et al. use a 15 MHz probe in experimental laboratory setting but a 4 to 5 MHz probe for an ultrasound guided posterior lumbar plexus block with a target deeper than 5 cm. To visualize the brachial plexus at 1 cm depth at the interscalene, supraclavicular, or axillary level, the 12 MHz transducer is obviously an excellent choice.",

Ultrasound is non-invasive, mobile and moderately priced. This real time imaging technology is really a plus in brachial plexus blocks and infraclavicular region. Such new image enhancing capability allows clear visualization of nerves. With the ultrasound guided technique, skin pressure exerted by the probe is probably less than manual palpation allowing a greater degree of nerve mobility. Whether ultrasound guided brachial plexus block can decrease the risk of nerve injury associated with needle trauma or intraneural injection is not known at this time. Another interesting finding of the current study is the inconsistency of nerve stimulated muscle contraction when the needle is in contact with a nerve in some cases.",

A preliminary scan prior to needle insertion shows distinct anatomic details of the nerves and their neighbouring structures. The site for needle puncture is the site with the shortest skin to nerve distance. It is easy to place the nerve seeking needle on the outer end of the ultrasound probe and advanced it in a lateral to medial direction. The most unique feature of this technique is the alignment of the path of needle advancement with that of the ultrasound beam. In this case, one can see the needle shaft and its tip as a hyperechoic linear shadow on the screen and can follow needle movement toward the target nerves. Guided by the ultrasound images, needle movements are controlled and target specific. Instantaneous feedback provided by real time imaging guides the angle, depth, and direction of needle penetration so that any improper shift is recognized and corrected quickly. It is noteworthy that there are other ultrasound guided nerve localization techniques advocating the passage of needle perpendicular to the ultrasound beam. In this case, only indistinct needle movement in the subcutaneous tissue can be observed and not the actual needle shaft. Dynamic examination of nerves shows that they are mobile structures and they typically move away or to the side when approached by the insulated needle. Conceivably, nerve movements may protect itself from direct needle injury to some extent.",

The brachial plexus components were successfully identified in the transverse view as round to oval hypoechoic structures with small internal punctuate echoes in all regions examined except the infraclavicular area (visualized in 27% of the cases). The authors' technique of advancing the needle in line with the ultrasound beam allowed moment by moment observation of the needle shaft and tip movement at time of nerve localization. Hypoechoic structures were stimulated electrically and confirmed to be nerves. These preliminary data show that the high resolution 5 to 12 MHz probe provides good quality brachial plexus ultrasound images in the superficial localisations (interscalene, supraclavicular, axil-lary and mid humeral regions). The needle technique described for ultrasound assisted nerve localization provides real time guidance and is potentially valuable for brachial plexus blocks.",

The onset time of the 3-in-1 block was significantly shorter (16 \u00b1 14 vs 27 \u00b1 16 min, p < 00.5) and the quality, on a percentage scale (100% representing uncompromised sensation), was significantly better in the ultrasound group (14 \u00b1 10% of initial value vs 17 \u00b1 14% of initial value, p < 0.05). The ultrasound group achieved a complete 3-in-1 block in 95% of the cases compared with 85% in the nerve stimulator group. In the second of their 2 studies [31] , the authors investigated whether ultrasound guidance in the 3-in-1 block affected the dose of local anaesthetic required. They compared 3 groups of 20 patients each. One ultrasound guided group using 0.5% bupivaca\u00efne 20 ml, and two nerve stimulator groups using 0.5% bupivaca\u00efne, 20 ml and 30 ml respectively. The study was identical in other aspects to the previous one, and the overall success rate, as defined by loss sensation to 30% of the baseline response, was 95% in the ultrasound guided patients and 80% in each of the other groups.",

They found only 76% of the 3011 epidural space examined within a \"normal\" range (4-6 cm). In 16% of parturients, the epidural space was located at a \"shallow\" depth (2-4 cm). As the skin to epidural space distance ranges from 2 to 9 cm, the flaval ligament can be anywhere in this 7 cm span. Pre puncture ultrasound examination reduces this probable depth to midline epidural entry\" to 7.9 mm span in 95% of all cases. However, first, the blunt Tuohy needle by a high pressure can cause a tissue deformation which account for a difference in the skin to epidural depths measured. Second, the Tuohy needle must be inserted beyond the flaval ligament to allow the passage of the catheter. So the skin to flaval ligament distance measured by ultrasound is a priori shorter than the depth of needle insertion at entry of the epidural space. Third, if the angle at which the epidural needle inserted differs from the angle used at scanning, the required depth of needle insertion will be greater than the distance measured by ultrasonography.",

However, the complicated answer is \"it depends\". It depends on what type of nerve block is planned, on what the complications are and on the individual's personal experience. Thus it may be used in certain blocks for which the complication rate is high or the complications are more serious, such as brachial plexus blocks. It might be considered particularly appropriate when performing nerve blocks in anaesthetized patients, such as the 3-in-1, for which it has been demonstrated that the success rate is higher using ultrasound and that the dose of local anaesthetic required is lower.",

From all these studies, it appears that ultrasound can be a useful aid whether it is used to locate arteries, to mark the skin for unguided blocks or as a real-time guide of needle or catheter position relative to the nerve or related blood vessels, and can be used to define the spread of local anaesthetic. However, it is interesting to note that, even with the ability to establish that the needle or catheter is close to the nerve, or within its sheath, and then to observe the spread of local anaesthetic, there is no guarantee of an adequate nerve block. In summary, we have a technique for peripheral nerve identification which is being used increasingly in research and appears to offer better accuracy and safety, but is technology-dependent and expensive. The high cost will limit its immediate general availability, but continued technical development and cost reduction will change this ultimately. Any method that offers even the possibility of improved accuracy in identifying the positions of nerves we wish to block and structures we do not wish to damage must continue to be evaluated.",

Adding technology to the medication administration process, like bar code systems that match patients with the right medications and IV pumps with the ability to set drug dosing limits, is seen as a solution to medication administration errors [4] . However, implementation of new technologies in health care has not been without troubles or work-around [2, 6] . Technologies can change the way work is being performed and, because healthcare work and processes are complex, negative consequences of new technologies are possible [3] . In our study, we use different human factors engineering methods to assess the positive and negative characteristics of the design and implementation of technologies on patient safety, as well as on end users (nurses and anesthesiologists).",

FMEA helped us understand that the pump use was not as \"intuitive\" as the other pumps the institution previously used. One outcome of the prospective analysis was to make training \"mandatory\" for all users before pump use. Users were trained on specific items, such as programming basic infusions, and picking the correct drug profile and medication in the drug profile. The FMEA process identified other problems, such as the possibility of pole clamps breaking (users were told not to hang the IV pump above patient head) and the importance of correctly loading the tubing. In addition, the FMEA heightened the awareness of a large group of people in the institution for the need to seek out problems that the pumps could introduce into the systems. The institution, therefore, was better 'equipped' at identifying problems early and dealing with them on a timely basis. Another organizational impact of the FMEA was to obtain buy-in from all disciplines using the pump, in particular anesthesia. A plan was worked out for the transfer of patients from the OR to the ICU or general care units post-op and included having the anesthesiologist select the correct profile based on where the patient was being transferred. As a result the pump did not have to be turned off and re-programmed upon the patient's arrival to the respective unit. From our experience, a number of challenges to the application of the FMEA process have been identified [7] .",

Implicit memory which is unconscious recall of intraoperative events could also be at higher risk during CS. From the six published studies during CS to assess memory processing, divergent results were obtained: four of them showed evidence of the presence of implict memory and sometimes explicit memory, while the two others failed to demonstrate any kind of memory processing. To further investigate memory processing during GA for CS we studied patients exposed to an auditory stimulus under BIS monitoring and anaesthesia maintained with a target controlled infusion (TCI) of propofol and remifentanil.",

The heart rate (HR) (ECG), blood pressure (BP), stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO), aorta pulsation (AP), ejector fraction (EF) and pulsatory amplitude of peripheral vessels (PAPV) were tested by noninvasive bioimpedans method. For estimation the haemodynamic regulation mechanisms we investigated the variability of all parameters. By means of Fourier analysis we determined the fluctuation power (FP) of HP in diapason of 0-0.5 Hz and its four ranges-UVLF (0-0.025 Hz -metabolic influences), VLF (0.025-0.075 Hz -humoral activity), LF (0.075-0.15 Hz -baroregulation), HF (0.15-0.5 Hz -parasympathetic or volume regulation). In addition to this analysis, we created the new method of brain activity estimation. Two needles were placed in the two points as a biparietal channel. This zone is considered to be the most sensible because of critical circulation as a result of three vessels systems connection. Then by proprietary software we fixed the middle EEG amplitude between two cardiac beats during the synchronously registration with HP. The trend of EEG amplitude for 500 cardiac beats was analyzed by Fourier method only in diapason of 0-0.5 Hz and the results were compared with the same of HP variability estimation.",

Almost all of patients had a baroregulation dominant in BP regulation, parasympathetic regulation of SV, CO, AP, EF and HR, and maximum of metabolic and humoral activity in PAPV. After that we examined 260 patients with severe brain damage (trauma, stroke and hypoxia). The variability of EEG amplitude and HP in the comatose patients was different, but it was possible to mark out four types of regulation. The increasing of FP in UVLF and VLF in EEG amplitude spectrum and in all HP was observed in patients with hemispheric processes (contusion, hemorrhage or infarction) as rule in case of moderate mass-effect. This type was associated with the good outcome and we appreciated it as an adaptive hypothalamic reaction. The second type was characterized by very high FP in VLF (\"splash activity\") in BP, SV, AP and CO spectrums. But this time the very low FP was revealed in HR and PAPV, especially in UVLF diapason. In EEG amplitude variability there were significant increasing of FP in HF and moderate decreasing of FP in UVLF, VLF, LF. This type was also observed in hemispheric damage, but the poor outcome, expressive catabolism and multiorgan failure were often in such cases. That is why we supposed that it might be an appearance of disadaptive hypothalamic reaction. In case of brain stem damage the substantial reduction of FP of all HP were revealed. In EEG amplitude spectrum the similar effect were observed but it was marked that the FP in LF diapason was decreased considerably. If the reducing of FP in all parameters turned out to be permanent it would result in poor outcome. In diffuse brain damage resulted of hypoxia we noticed the preference decreasing of FP in UVLF of HR, EF, PAPV and in EEG amplitude, also FP in all diapasons were reduced.",

For induction, all patients received 4 mg propofol/kg over 6 min followed by 4 mg/kg/h. For analgesia patients received 0.3 \u00b5g/kg/min remifentanil starting 2 min before propofol application. 0.1-0.15 mg cisatracurium/kg were administered to facilitate tracheal intubation. The EEG was recorded simultanously with the Narcotrend and the Aspect A-2000 EEG monitor. Data from start of propofol injection until 1 min after the end of the induction period, i.e. a time interval of 420 s, were used for statistical analysis. EEG parameters were evaluated every 10 s. All patients were intubated after the study period. Propofol effect-site concentrations were calculated using STANPUMP (Shafer SL, http://pkpd.icon.paloalto.med.va.gov). Spearman rank correlation was used to quantify the correlation between the investigated EEG parameters and the propofol effect-site concentration.",

The teletherapeutic system consisted of two computer subsystems at the 'patientsite' in Munich and the 'control-site' in Erlangen. Both computer systems were connected through a virtual private network (VPN) with a high speed terrestrial optical-fibre connection of 100 to 1000 megabits per second. Data were transmitted using the UDP protocol. At the 'patient-site' the patient's EEG (one channel: Fp1-Fz) was recorded with an Aspect A1000 monitor. The raw digitized EEG signal (sampling rate: 128 Hz, resolution: 16 bit) and the processed EEG variables were transferred to the 'patient-site' computer. Every second, a package of 1664 bytes containing the EEG data was sent to the 'control-site' computer, where the EEG was analyzed and the median frequency (MEF) of the EEG power spectrum was calculated from epochs of 8 seconds length. The propofol infusion rate was determined by a model-based adaptive feedback algorithm to achieve and maintain a defined MEF. If the EEG was disturbed by artefacts, propofol was administered as target-controlled infusion (TCI). Every 8 seconds, the propofol delivery rate of the infusion pump was updated by the 'control-site' computer and the actual infusion rate was checked. Additional information e.g. the dosing of the analgesic drug, hemodynamic parameters, the status of the surgery and comments were transferred between the computers as free text in a message box. At any time, the anaesthetist at the 'patient site' was able to stop the remote control of propofol and continue the propofol administration by manual dosing.",

For signal acquisition a specially adapted four channel electrophysiologic recording system was used (Neuroscreen, Viasys Healthcare, Hoechberg, Germany; EEG \"Infinity POD\", Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) [1] . Each AEP epoch consisted of 1000, each SSEP epoch of 306 stimuli. EEG (i.e. no stimulus), AEP and SSEP stimuli were sequentially applied and evenly distributed. Each modality was measured for 1.7 min. In each patient the order of stimulus modalities was randomly chosen for 9 intervals, these intervals were constantly repeated during anaesthesia. A total of 201 cases of the 81 variables at stable anaesthetic states were recorded. For this data set a factor analysis was performed. Results: Seventeen variables were excluded because of multicollinearity. For the remaining 64 times 172 matrix we extracted 11 factors with eigenvalues >1 and representing 79.4% of total variance. The first 3 factors represented 13.5%, 13.2% and 13.1% of total variance. Factor 1 had only significant loadings from AEP variables, factor 2 only significant loadings from EEG variables and factor 3 significant loadings from SSEP variables.",

Predictive models may benefit physicians in risk stratification and therefore may be used to optimize resources. Severity Systems developed in another country should by validated in the population to which they are finally applied. 1 Introduction: Every ICU admits critically ill patients with disturbed vitally important functions. Time is a critical factor with such patients and the optimum behaviour of the medical team is decisive. Parallel processes of varying complexity, connected with patient care, are taking place at the ICU. They require optimised distribution of the staff and material resources, hence an adequate model of the structure and activities in an ICU is needed. Such a model was built using generalized nets (GNs).",

The PC works as a black-box, the user doesn't have to know how it works, but just switch it on.

Mecanical arterial net model, in order to study flow distribution regarding to vessel compliance. Most of these last models do not include \"active\"changes of vessel resistance. Auto-regulation is defined as the artery network ability to adapt resistance to blood pressure variations, in order to keep the blood flow constant. A part of this regulation is supported by the myogenic reflex. This basic reflex is an autonomous feedback loop leading arteries to develop their resistance as wall tension increases, using vaso-activity.The aim of this study is to simulate the behaviour of a vasoreactive arterial tree, and to test its ability to regulate flow distribution. We used a \"finite difference\" type of model. For each vessel of a binary tree, intraluminal pressure variations led to volume variations, and to resistance variations. Thus, pressure and resistance evolved in the same way. The model allows to test the behaviour of the net for varying blood pressure and for varying \"neuron consumption\".Such a model highlights two main phenomena:-The modelized myogenic reflex, when applied to each branch of an arterial binary tree, can assume auto regulation and flux distribution.A spontaneous feedback loop synchronisation is observed in the arterial net during simulation. This last characteristic of the net behaviour could lead to a better understanding of slow cyclic arterial volume variations. Introduction: Acute severe asthma remains a major economic and health burden. Mortality in medical intensive care units is higher but is less than 3% of hospital admissions, pediatrics patients seemed to be the major target [1] .Methods: We described the case of a 2 year old boy (18 kg) admitted for acute distress syndrom with hypercapnic acidosis (ph 7.1). Despite nebulisation of adrenaline (0.02 mg/Kg), intravenous perfusions of salbutanol (1 mg/Kg/h) and hydrocortisone (2 mg/Kg) the spasticity continued and the patient dropped unconscious. NIV by BIPAP Vision (Respironix) was applied under intravenous anesthesia with clonidine (2\u00b5g/kg-titrations doses). After 10 minutes, refractory poor ventilatory performances staid unchanged. Heliox (80%-He+/20%-O 2 ) 6litres per minute was connected to the facial mask until spasticity was ruled out totally (3 hours long). Ventilatory flow and airways pressures were measured every 5 minutes evolution's times.Results: Within 30 minutes the ventilatory parameters normalized (Insp vol >10 ml/kg; Thoracic approach comply <25; Resp. Freq. <16/ ) and the child recovered consciousness. During this period an estimation of 60% of He(+) reached the patient's bronchopulmonary tract through the ventilatory system after what it's concentration Introduction: The aim of this work was to evaluate mortality in cardiac surgery -overall mortality, coronary mortality, and valve surgery mortality-, and to assess and to validate the performance of European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation or Euroscore to predict this mortality.Methods: Prospective observational study of 1241 consecutive cardiac surgery patients in a tertiary referral center operated since January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2003 . Clinical and physiologic data for several cardiac surgery risk model were prospectively collected applying the criteria and definitions described by the developers Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (SPSS 11.0 inc. Chicago IL). Predicted hospital mortality was calculated and was compared with the actual mortality. The performance of the system was assessed by evaluating calibration with the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test, and discrimination with the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.Results: The sex ratio was 36.9% women (n = 458) vs 60.6% men (n = 783), and the mean age was 60.6 \u00b1 14 years. The operation performed were 51.1% (n = 635) coronary surgery, 42.8% (n = 532) valve surgery, and 5.9% (n = 74) mixed (coronary & valve surgery) surgery. The overall hospital mortality was 5.4%. The coronary surgery mortality was 3.6%. The valve surgery mortality was 6.7%. The mixed surgery mortality was 10.8%. Lemeshow-Hosmer chi-square was 5.60 for overall cardiac surgery, 5.11 for coronary surgery, and 5.94 for valve surgery. The area under the ROC curve was 0.817 (CI 95%: 0.765-0.869) for overall cardiac surgery, 0.834 (CI 95%: 0.755-0.913) for coronary surgery, and 0.801 (CI 95%: 0.733-0.869) for valve surgery.Several systems have been developed to aid in the process of selecting appropriate ventilator settings in mechanically ventilated patients. Those finding their way into clinical practice have focused using rules to automate clinical protocols for particular ventilator modes [1] , or to keep the patient within a \"zone of comfort\" during pressure support ventilation [2] . Key to these rule-based systems is that they automate the heuristics of the clinician, controlling patient ventilation without providing a deep physiological picture of the patient's state. This presentation describes a different approach to computer support for selecting optimal ventilator settings. A decision support system will be presented which is based on physiological models of O 2 transport CO 2 transport and lung mechanics combined with utility functions describing clinical preference toward the outcomes of changing ventilator settings. If the physiological models are tuned to a particular patient, by estimating the parameters, they might be used to simulate \"what if \" questions predicting the outcomes of ventilation strategies. In addition, when physiological models are combined with the utility functions outcomes can be quantified and ventilator settings selected so as to maximize expected utility.Currently the system has been tested retrospectively using the data of 19 stable post-operative CABG patients studied at the ICU. Values of ventilation, arterial and mixed venous blood gases, and cardiac output were measured and computer generated settings for FiO 2 , Vt and f were compared to those used in the clinic by thoracic anaesthesiologist. In general the system suggested ventilator settings similar to those of the clinician.An IDS is a software that can analyze the data traffic on the network, on this basis, it can discover menace or attack attempts and talk to the firewall to strength the defence.Computers on the Internet share information using a common protocol (a set of rules that allows the orderly exchange of information) known as TCP/IP. It is very simple and it is based on four layers of abstraction: (1) Network Access, (2) Internet, (3) Transport and (4) Application. Every host has got at least one unique IP address that allows it's recognition on the network. To run different applications (layer 4) that use the network at the same time it as been introduced the concept of logical ports: these are kind of channels that can be used by different software to talk at the same host at the same time.The system administrator chooses what kind of services to make available the closing and the opening of logical ports. The wise administrator knows that the golden rule is to close every port that isn't necessary, but the real risk is to build a network where no service is available.Advanced services and Open Source solutions: The administration of a network (whether small or at enterprise level) can be done using Open Source software, that is software developed by the scientific community for the scientific community. The key word is just making the source available to the whole community of developers to share the knowledge: this means more quality (everybody can improve the project), less risk of virus infection or of attack using software unknown bugs (everybody can read the code), less investment in licensees.The most used solution for building firewall and IDS are IPTABLES, which is part of the \"netfilter\" project and SNORT. Netfilter is implemented at the kernel level of Linux itself, so if you install this OS with the network extensions, you have got the firewall ready to work too. The setup of IPTABLES may require some more technical skills, but the configuration of every firewall system could require the consultancy of a pro.More than this, the administrator of a ICU network can offer advanced services to his colleagues, just building a small intranet. The basis can start from implementing a small web server running Apache (the most used web server on the Internet, another Open Source project). It can run whether on Microsoft Windows or on Linux platforms, so the administrator has to choose the one that make him feel more comfortable. The second step could be the implementation of advanced services, like distance learning services, for remote colleagues, or dynamic web sites to use as distributed healthcare and medical information system. The most diffused and simple way to build a dynamic web site or intranet is to use the LAMP platform.LAMP is the acronym for Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP: all Open Source solutions. Linux and Apache are the most known Open Source projects, so following we will describe the other two: MySQL is a relational database system (RDBMS: Relational Database Management System) known to be the fastest web oriented database, while PHP is a script language used to interface Apache, the web server, with the RDBMS.The use of the LAMP platform requires just a few programmer's skill, but if you are not interested in programming you can look for a ready to use Open Source project and look for a professional that will install, make it work and customize for you. That will represent a start-up cost that will not be present anymore, in fact there will be no license fees at all.Conclusions: The role of a system/network administrator is really tactful, actually it requires a lot of good sense to prevent attacks from the outside and to protect the privacy of ICU patients, but also there is a lot of hard decisions to take to make the network itself works. The use of Open Source solutions can improve the work flow of the whole department and reduce considerably the start-up and the management cost of software used.",
