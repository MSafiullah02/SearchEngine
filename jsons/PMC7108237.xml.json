For example, among travellers returning from South-East Asia or the Caribbean with a fever, dengue is an important differential diagnosis, whereas enteric fever is more likely in travellers from South Asia.2 In contrast, malaria remains the most important single cause of fever in travellers returning from sub-Saharan Africa.2\n",

It should be noted, however, that some VHFs, in particular Crimean\u2013Congo haemorrhagic fever, have a more global distribution. It is often worth asking the patient whether they are aware of any local outbreaks (e.g. Ebola, Legionella) while they were travelling, or local areas of particularly high endemic risk (e.g. for schistosomiasis).

A detailed risk assessment is particularly important when assessing travellers returning from a VHF-endemic country (see Case 1) and for travellers who return from the Middle East with a severe acute respiratory illness.
