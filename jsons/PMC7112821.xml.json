            "text": "Natural killer (NK) cells represent a discrete subset of innate lymphocytes that act as first line of defense against several microbial infections, early cellular transformation and tumor growth. NK cell prompt response is mainly related to their ability to release cytolytic mediators such as perforin and granzymes or to express ligands able to trigger death receptors on target cells; moreover they can also secrete a wide array of cytokines and chemokines to recruit and to instruct other immune cell types [1], [2]. The main site of NK cell differentiation is the bone marrow (BM) where they develop from a common lymphoid progenitor that generates also B and T lymphocytes. Notably, NK cell precursor has been found also outside the BM, thus suggesting that NK cell development can occur also in the peripheral tissue microenvironment [3], [4].",

            "text": "During development, NK cells have to pass through several stages of differentiation in order to progressively acquire a mature phenotype consisting of both activating and inhibitory receptors as well as adhesion molecules and chemotactic receptors, and effector ability. Among growth factors critically involved in NK cell differentiation, a crucial role is played by IL-15 and its receptor. IL-15 needs to be trans-presented by cells expressing IL-15Ralpha chain and was found on the surface of several hematopoietic or non-hematopoietic cells such as dendritic cells or stromal cells both in the BM and in peripheral tissues where it promotes the generation of NK cells from their precursors and the differentiation of immature NK cells and represents a survival signal for mature NK cells [5], [6]. In regard to human NK cell development, there are evidence that human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells and hematopoietic progenitors, including NK cell precursors [7], are present within the BM, and that co-culture of BM-derived CD34+ cells with BM stromal cells promotes the differentiation of cytotoxic NK cells in vitro\n[8]; however, unlike the mouse, the identification of different stages of human NK cell differentiation within the BM is still lacking. By contrast, at least five distinct progressive stages of NK cell development have been described in the secondary lymphoid tissues such as lymph nodes (LNs) and tonsils, based on the expression of distinct set of markers and functional capability: stage 1, CD34+CD45RA+CD117\u2212CD161\u2212CD94\u2212; stage 2, CD34+CD45RA+CD117+CD161+/\u2212CD94\u2212; stage 3, CD34\u2212CD117+CD161+NKp46\u2212CD94\u2212; stage 4, CD34\u2212CD117+/\u2212NKp46+CD94+CD16\u2212CD56brigh; and stage 5, CD34\u2212CD117\u2212NKp46+CD94+/\u2212CD16+CD56dim. From stage 1/pro-NK cells to stage 2/pre NK cells and stage 3/immature NK (iNK) cells, these cells become committed to the NK cell lineage; from stage 3 to 5, they undergo functional maturation in that iNK cells can produce GM-CSF and potentially type 2 cytokines, while stage 4/CD56bright NK cells preferentially release IFN-gamma, and stage 5/CD56dim NK cells are the principal cytotoxic population. Within stage 4 and 5, NK cells also acquire the killer inhibitory receptors (KIR) [4], [9].",

            "text": "Similarly to human, mouse NK cell development involves distinct stages that can be identified by multi-parameter cell surface marker analysis and that comprise functionally distinct NK cell subsets. Precursor cells committed to the NK cell lineage (pNKs) express the common beta chain of the interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-15 receptors (CD122) and lack surface proteins associated with mature hematopoietic cells (referred to as Lineage negative or Lin\u2212), including most NK cell receptors with the exception of NKG2D and 2B4 (CD244) [3]. Generation of these cells does not require IL-15, but responsiveness to this cytokine is critical for later steps of the differentiation process [6]. As pNKs mature they progressively acquire a number of NK cell receptors, including NKR-P1C and NKp46. At this stage, the cells initiate expression of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-recognition receptors encoded by CD94 in combination with NKG2A/C/E, and the Ly49 genes, which encode a family of C-type lectin receptors. Subsequently, the cells up-regulate the alpha2/CD49b integrin (DX5) and acquire cytolytic and cytokine producing capacities. Within DX5+ NK cells, two populations with different functional competence can be identified by the level of expression of the CD11b integrin chain (CD11blow and CD11bhigh). A better characterization of functionally distinct NK cell subsets is provided by the analysis of CD27, a costimulatory molecule belonging to the TNF receptor superfamily, that is downmodulated during CD11bhigh NK cell differentiation. Thus, three distinct subpopulations that are developmentally related can be identified: CD11blow/CD27high, CD11bhigh/CD27high, that display the higher effector capacity and CD11bhigh/CD27low, that represents a subsequent stage of maturation [10] The latter population can also be identified by KLRG1 expression, a C-type lectin inhibitory receptor [11]. Recent observations suggest that CD27high to CD27low transition may occur in the spleen and is driven by splenic monocyte-presented IL-15.",

Nevertheless, NK cells from several extramedullary tissues display tissue specific phenotypes suggesting that maturation can be completed in organ different from BM including thymus, spleen, LNs and liver. In mice, the identification of immature NK cells in the liver that express the effector molecule TRAIL and the recent identification of thymus-derived GATA-3+ CD127+ NK cells are in agreement with the prediction of an organ-specific maturation of NK precursors [12]. Differently from BM-derived NK cells, thymic-derived NK cells preferentially home to LN, where they maintain CD127 and GATA-3 expression and display stronger cytokine production and less cytotoxic ability than their splenic counterpart. These functional characteristics are similar to the CD56hiCD16\u2212 human NK cells subset, which was also found to be CD127+ and to express Gata-3.",

In all these organs, NK cells have been found in close proximity of vasculature, and in most instances in areas distinct from those of T or B cells. In the spleen, NK cells are primarily present in the red pulp where they co-localize with endothelial cells suggesting that splenic NK cells are mainly distributed within blood sinuses or vessels [14], [15], [16]. Also in mouse BM a fraction of NK cells, comprising mostly mature cells, was found to reside in sinusoids [17]. Using immunohistochemical analysis and dynamic intravital imaging of the LNs, it has been shown that NK cells reside in the medulla, in the perifollicular regions as well as in the paracortex where they co-localize with dendritic cells (DC). In a steady state condition, the density of LN NK cells is higher in the medulla than in T or B cell areas and they are mainly located within lymphatic sinuses [18].",

            "text": "It has been previously reported that peripheral blood human NK cells express both CXCR1 and CXCR2 as CXCL8 (IL-8) receptor [30], [31], [32] and CX3CR1 as CX3CL1 (fractalkine) receptor [33]. These observations have been further extended by Campbell et al. who provided the first evidence that distinct (CD56posCD16neg and CD56posCD16pos) peripheral blood NK cell subsets have a unique repertoire of chemokine receptors [34]. CD16pos, that are bona fide CD56low, NK cells uniformly express high levels of CXCR1 and CX3CR1, low levels of CXCR2 and CXCR3 and no detectable levels of CXCR5. By contrast, CD16neg (mostly CD56bright) NK cells express high levels of CXCR3, CCR5 and CCR7, the latter molecule mainly involved in the homing of lymphocytes to secondary lymphoid organs and low levels of CX3CR1, and are negative for CXCR1, CXCR2 and CXCR5; moreover, both NK cell subsets express high levels of CXCR4, the receptor for CXCL12 (SDF-1alpha/beta). The differences in chemokine receptor expression correlate with differences in the migratory behavior, being CD16pos NK cells more responsive to CXCL8 and CX3CL1 and the CD16neg cells to CCL19 and CCL21 as well as to CXCL10 and CXCL11. Both NK cell subsets strongly migrate in response to the ligand of CXCR4, CXCL12 [34], [35]. Besides chemokine receptors, human and mouse NK cells were also shown to express receptors for chemotactic molecules that do not belong to the chemokine superfamily, and can regulate NK cell trafficking under steady state and inflammatory conditions. In this regard, NK cells were shown to migrate in response to the pro-inflammatory plasma protein chemerin, and CD56lowCD16pos, but not CD56highCD16neg NK cells express its receptor, ChemR23. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a sphingo-phospholipid generated by the conversion of sphingomyelin into ceramide by sphingomyelinase, that influences lymphocyte trafficking as well as proliferation, adherence and morphogenesis [36]. Previous reports show that human NK cells express the mRNA for S1P1, while mouse NK cells express both S1P1 and S1P5 and migrate in response to S1P [37], [38]. Interestingly, the selective expression of CXCR3 on CD56high and of CX3CR1 on CD56low NK cells is very similar to their expression pattern on the two main subsets of mouse mature NK cells defined as CD27high and CD27low. Indeed, as compared to CD27low NK cells, CD27high (both CD11blow and CD11bhigh) cells have higher expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR4, selectively express CXCR3 and have much lower expression of the chemoattractant receptor S1P5 and CX3CR1 [28], [38]. Moreover, the recent identification of chemokine receptor expressing mouse NK cell subsets with distinct effector functions suggests that discrete subsets of NK cells can be defined according to their chemokine receptor expression profile [17], [39], [40].",

Stimulation for longer periods of time with IL-2 resulted in increased expression of CCR1, CCR2, CCR4, CCR5 and CCR8 [42], while expression of CXCR2 and ChemR23 decreased [43]. CXCR4 and CX3CR1 have been shown to be down-regulated through stimulation with other cytokines, including IL-15, whereas TGF-beta has been proven to be a potent inducer of CXCR4 on NK cell subsets [42], [44].

CXCL12 deficiency has been associated with severely reduced number of early B cell precursors in fetal liver during embryogenesis. Also the adult BM of irradiated mice reconstituted with CXCR4-deficient fetal cells shows a marked reduction of B cell precursor, including pre-pro B cells that correlate with their enrichment in blood as compared to control mice [57]. Correspondingly, adventitial reticular cells that express high level of CXCL12 (CXCL12 abundant reticular (CAR) cells) were found to be in strict contact with pre-pro B cells [58]. Beside BM, CXCR4 play a role also during thymocyte differentiation being CXCR4 deficiency associated to a reduced number of thymocytes, likely due to the loss of mitogenic stimuli provided by CXCL12 [59].",

            "text": "The role of chemokines in NK cell development is less defined. It has been demonstrated that NK cells change their chemokine expression profile during development in BM. CXCR4 is highly expressed by pNK cells but its expression progressively decreases during development. The progressive decrease of CXCR4 parallels the increased expression of CXCR3, CCR1 and CX3CR1 on mature NK cells, being the expression of CX3CR1 mainly confined to the KLRG1+ subset that poorly expresses CXCR4 and does not express CXCR3 [17], [60]. Interestingly, expression of CX3CR1 on KLRG1+ cells was shown to define a more differentiated NK cell subset that is developmentally related to KLRG1+CX3CR1\u2212 NK cells [17]. The role of CXCR4 receptor on NK cell retention in BM was analyzed by in vivo administration of CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100, that induced the reduction of immature and mature NK cells in the bone marrow and their increase in spleen and peripheral blood, indicating that CXCL12 regulates the retention of selected NK cell subsets at various stages of maturation in the BM during development [60]. This is also supported by the evidence that retention of NK cells residing in BM sinusoids, that likely represent cells that have completed their maturation in BM and are ready to exit into systemic blood circulation, is CXCR4-independent [17]. Recently, Noda et al. showed that NK cell development is severely impaired in adult CXCR4 conditionally deficient mice and this was correlated with reduced number of NK cell precursors, decreased proliferation rate of CXCR4 deficient DX5\u2212 iNK cells and with the ability of CXCL12 to promote mature NK cell generation from lymphoid precursor and immature NK cells in the presence of IL-15 [61]. In addition, using chemokine receptor deficient mice it was evidenced that also CCR5 but not CCR1 can participate to NK cell differentiation and this was associated to regulation of developing NK cell proliferation under physiological conditions [62]. In regard to CXCR4, it was demonstrated that a fraction of CAR cells co-express IL-15 and IL-15Ralpha and thus CAR cells may trans-present IL-15 and provide CXCL12 to NK cells during development. The latter hypothesis is supported by immunofluorescence studies on BM tissue sections showing that NKp46+ NK cells can be found in close proximity to CAR cells in vivo. The observation that the residual fraction of NKp46+ NK cells that develop into BM in CXCR4-deficient mice is still close to CXCL12-producing cells suggested that CXCR4 is not required for NK-CAR cell co-localization. However, a role of CXCR4 in NK cell localization in BM microenvironments during normal development cannot be excluded as CXCR4-deficiency led to a strong impairment of NK cell development and to marked reduction of maturing NK cell subsets. In addition, CXCL12 may also be presented by other BM cells, including osteoblasts.",

Indeed, although their CXCR4 expression is higher as compared to more mature NK cells, ex vivo migration and in vivo retention of these cells into BM is less influenced by CXCL12, while in vivo proliferation of more immature NK cell is more dependent on CXCR4 expression [60], [61]. On the other hand, CXCR4/CXCL12 interaction is required to maintain immature and mature NK cells in BM parenchyma during maturation and thus indirectly can favor NK cell response to differentiation stimuli (Fig. 1\n).",

A drastic decrease in NK cell numbers has been observed in the blood, spleen, and lungs of S1P5-deficient mice, associated with increased number of NK cells in the BM and LNs. This altered distribution has suggested that S1P5 provides an egress signal to NK cells, promoting their exit from BM and LNs [38]. In addition, the observation that CX3CR1-deficient mice display a selective reduction of DX5+CD3\u2212 cell number in the lung, strongly suggests that this receptor is important for the accumulation of at least one subset of NK cells in this organ under steady state conditions [63]. Maintenance of a subset of NK cell in the liver depends on the chemokine receptor CXCR6. Indeed, the ligand for CXCR6, CXCL16, is constitutively presented by the liver sinusoidal endothelium and CXCR6+ NK cells that represent a consistent fraction of liver NK cells, are drastically reduced in CXCR6\u2212/\u2212 mice [40]. Also the expression of CXCR4 profoundly affects NK cell subset distribution likely by contributing to the maintenance of an NK cell pool within BM, as shown by the recruitment of BM iNK and mNK cells into circulation and spleen following in vivo delivery of the CXCR4 pharmacological antagonist AMD-3100 [60].",

It has been reported that during murine cytomegalovirus infection, NK cells migrate through a CCL3-dependent mechanism to sites of liver infection where they contribute to antiviral defense [64]. This evidence was further supported by the demonstration that CCL3-deficient mice show decreased resistance to cytomegalovirus infection that is associated with a dramatic reduction of NK cell accumulation and IFN-gamma production in the liver. The recruitment of NK cells to the liver during infection required the receptor for CCL3, CCR5, and the receptor for CCL2, CCR2 [64], [65]. IFN-gamma-dependent recruitment of NK cells to liver has also been described in a model of Concanavalin A-induced hepatitis. In this case, NK cell entry in the liver was reduced in the absence of CCR1 and involved NK cells that used CXCR3 to exit the spleen [66]. CXCR6 was also shown to play a relevant role for the maintenance into liver of a population of CXCR6+ NK cells that retained antigen-specific memory after antigen challenge [40].",

In addition, using an in vivo model of NK cell-mediated lung tumor cell clearance in CX3CR1-deficient mice or after treatment with blocking antibodies against CX3CL1 or CX3CR1, it has been demonstrated that decreased clearance of tumor cells following perturbation of CX3CL1/CX3CR1 interaction is attributable to defective NK cell recruitment to the lung [63], [70].

In addition, a link between IFN-gamma induction of CXCR3 ligand expression during the anti-tumor immune response and CD27high NK cell recruitment within the tumor mass was found to be critical for host survival [76]. In addition, CX3CL1-transfected tumor cells exhibit a reduced growth capability that is mediated by an increased recruitment and activation of NK cells [70].",

By using selective depletion and adoptive transfer experiments, Martin-Fontecha et al. have reported that DC-induced recruitment of NK cells into LN occurs in a CXCR3- but not CCR7-dependent manner. The entry of NK cells within the T cell area of secondary lymphoid organs has several implications allowing their correct priming by DC as well as an efficient T cell polarization [77], [78]. The role of CXCR3 as well as CCL5 receptors has also been emphasized within the spleen in the recruitment of red pulp-localized NK cells to the white pulp during TLR ligand stimulation in vivo\n[16]. Interestingly, the entry of NK cells into the splenic red pulp is Pertussis Toxin (PTX)-insensitive, thus suggesting that NK cell localization into this organ is regulated by a chemokine-independent or a PTX-insensitive chemokine receptor.",

            "text": "\nIn vivo, interaction between NK cells and DC has been suggested to occur in the spleen during viral or bacterial infection [80]. Following infection with Listeria monocytogenes, CCR2-mediated signals promote emigration of monocytes from bone marrow into the blood stream and eventually to infected tissues where monocytes differentiate into TNF and iNOS producing DCs (Tip-DCs). In this regard Auffray et al. showed that recruitment of monocytes to the spleen during Lm infection involves another chemokine receptor, namely CX3CR1 [81]. During infection, DC cells where shown to promote a marked CD11b+ and NK cells reorganization in clusters positioned in the T cell areas of the spleen, with the CD11b+ cells organized centrally and the NK cells localized peripherally [82]. NK cells were the predominant producers of IFN-gamma, inducing differentiation of CD11b+ monocytes into Tip-DC. Among a number of chemokine receptors analyzed, mice deficient in CCR5, the receptor for CCL3-5, had a consistent but partial defect in NK cell clustering while myeloid cell localization were little affected by the lack of this receptor. NK cell interaction with monocytes in spleen may occur also during steady state. Indeed, Soderquest et al. recently evidenced that splenic monocytes drive transition of CD11bhighCD27high NK cell into CD11bhighCD27low in a IL-15-dependent manner [83]. Beside spleen, several chemokines participates in the recruitment of immune cells into LNs that represent critical sites for NK cell interaction with other immune cells such as DCs and for their ability to modulate DC-dependent Th1 cell polarization during inflammation promoted by adjuvants or LPS-activated DCs [77], [78]. NK cell entry was shown to be CXCR3-dependent and this correlated with a rapid and transient expression of CXCL9 in the luminal side of reactive nodes. Subsequent interaction with DC occurs to promote NK cell priming and may be driven by DC-produced chemokines including another CXCR3 ligand, CXCL10. Intravital imaging studies suggested that NK cell priming during inflammation does not require the formation of stable contact between NK cells and DCs during time and paralleled a broader distribution of NK cells that were more located in the deep T cell zone as compared to steady state [84].",

Co-localization studies revealed that NK cells resided in close proximity to CNS microglial cells during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and this correlated with microglial cell killing, thus resulting in NK cell-mediated suppression of Th17 differentiation. Furthermore, CNS NK cells readily produce CCL3 while microglia produced CCL2 likely resulting in reciprocal chemoattraction [74]. Recent evidences describe a cross-talk also between NK cells and neutrophils. Human NK cells may influence the survival and activation of neutrophils under co-culture conditions via the release of IFN-gamma or granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) plus IFN-gamma, while neutrophil production of ROS reduces survival and activation of NK cells. It has been also suggested that the ROS preferentially affect the CD56low NK cell subset thus indirectly favoring CD56high NK cell-mediated responses. Thus, beside their ability to regulate neutrophil recruitment, chemokines production by NK cells could also affect NK cell\u2013neutrophil encounter in inflamed tissues contributing to the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases [85].",
