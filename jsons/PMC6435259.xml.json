Subsequently, in addition to their non-specific degradative function, a role for proteases in catalyzing a substrate-specific proteolytic cleavage resulting in the production of new protein products has become appreciated [2]. There is hardly a signaling process in a living cell that is not associated with protease activity in one way or another. Besides regulating the localization and activity of proteins, proteases create new bioactive molecules as well as generate, transduce, and amplify cellular signals through modulation of protein-protein interactions [3]. Thus proteases regulate multiple biological processes including cell proliferation, differentiation and morphogenesis, DNA replication and transcription, tissue morphogenesis and remodeling, autophagy, apoptosis, etc. [4\u201311]. Considering the multitude of cellular functions performed by proteases, it is no surprise that alterations in proteolytic systems occur during several pathological conditions such as cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, inflammation, and cardiovascular diseases.",

Apoptosis can be activated extrinsically through the activation of cell surface death receptors like TNF-\u03b1 or intrinsically through mitochondria-mediated release of cytochrome c. Irrespective of extrinsically or intrinsically activated apoptosis, the two pathways converge on activation of terminal, effector caspases, culminating in cell death [12]. Caspases are a family of cysteine-aspartic proteases that drive the process of apoptosis by cleaving essential proteins and thus dismantling the unwanted or damaged cell [13]. Caspases 3 and 7 are effector caspases that are activated in response to initiator caspases, caspases 8 and 9, which are activated in response to an extrinsic or intrinsic signal, respectively [13, 14]. Caspase 3/7 activation is used as a surrogate marker for apoptosis [15, 16]. Activation of the proteolytic activity of Caspase 3/7 has been used to design assays to interrogate the initiation of apoptosis and its deregulation in cancer [17, 18].",

            "text": "\nBioluminescence is the emission of light by a chemiluminescent reaction involving light-generating enzymes called luciferases, which are a large family of enzymes that catalyze the oxidation of a substrate, luciferin, into oxyluciferin, with the concomitant production of light [19, 20]. At the cellular level, this light can be captured and detected using an extremely sensitive cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) camera or a photomultiplier. With the current advancement of instrumentation, bioluminescence imaging can be used to carry out real-time functional imaging of biological processes like protein-protein interactions, kinase activities, cellular trafficking, disease progression and response to therapy, etc. [21]. This is achieved by using a reporter gene that is genetically engineered and encodes the light-generating enzyme luciferase in a form such that its catalytic activity is modulated in context of a protein modifying activity (e.g., protease or a kinase). In the presence of a substrate, luciferase-expressing cells emit a blue to yellow-green light with an emission spectra peaking at a wavelength between 490 and 620 nm. This noninvasive imaging modality is extremely sensitive over a broad dynamic range with an exceptionally large signal-to-noise ratio. Presently, more than 30 luciferase-luciferin systems are known, but the most frequently used luciferase for in vivo molecular imaging is the ATP-dependent firefly (Photinus pyralis) luciferase [19]. The main advantage of using firefly luciferase is the high signal-to-noise ratio as 30% of the light produced by firefly luciferase has an emission spectrum above 600 nm, a region with the least amount of signal attenuation due to absorbing and scattering properties of live mammalian tissue [19]. More recently, a smaller but very bright luciferase NanoLuc from deep sea shrimp (Oplophorus gracilirostris) has been successfully engineered [22]. NanoLuc uses a new substrate to produce light which is 100-fold brighter than that of firefly luciferase [23].",

Conceptually, protein complementation technology involves reporter gene manipulation, wherein a monomeric reporter is split into two inactive components, which when brought together can reconstitute a functionally active molecule. Split- luciferase reporters where the luciferase has been divided into two halves (N-Luc and C-Luc) have been developed to study protein-protein interactions. These split-luciferase reporters are based on either the intermolecular or intramolecular complementation of the luciferase fragments to generate signal in response to cellular cues [24, 25]. In our laboratory we have utilized the split-luciferase technology to develop reporters for the activities of several kinases including AKT [26, 27], GSK3\u03b2 [28], CK1\u03b1 [28], and ATM [29] and more recently proteases like Caspase 3/7 [30].",

            "text": "Previously, we have reported the generation of a hybrid polypeptide that noninvasively reports on Caspase-3 activity in living cells and animals [31]. This reporter, called as ANLucBCLuc, comprised of a fusion of two small interacting peptides, peptide A and peptide B, with NLuc and CLuc fragments of luciferase on their N terminals, respectively, with an intervening Caspase-3 cleavage site (DEVD) between pepANLuc (ANLuc) and pepBCLuc (BCLuc) [31]. In response to apoptosis, activated Caspase 3 cleaves the engineered reporter, enabling dissociation of ANLuc from BCLuc and thus facilitating the high-affinity interaction between peptide A and peptide B. This interaction restores luciferase enzymatic activity by NLuc and CLuc complementation resulting in the generation of light in the presence of substrate, luciferin [31]. The reporter was found to be very useful in vivo but had limitations in high-throughput screens in vitro due to its significant background signal. Continuing our efforts to develop an effective and highly sensitive imaging reporter for Caspase 3/7 activity, we utilized recent advances in biosensor research including circularly permuted forms of firefly luciferase and thermostable Photinus pyralis luciferases [32\u201334]. In collaboration with Promega Corporation, we screened a library of randomly mutated thermally stable luciferase constructs permuted at residue 358 and found a reporter with >50-fold induction of bioluminescence activity following stimulation. The reporter has been further engineered such that the magnitude of the luminescence increase is directly proportional to the amount of analyte or protease activity present and has been made commercially available as GloSensor\u2122 luciferase [35]. This reporter has been used by several investigators to generate biosensors for the activity of various other proteases. Li et al. used the GloSensor technology to develop biosensors for the proteolytic activity of granzyme B/Caspase 8 and used it in combination with the Caspase 3/7 reporter to examine the distinct pattern ofcaspase activation cascade induced by granzyme B vs Fas [36]. Kilianski et al. utilized the GloSensor reporter to develop reporters for imaging the activity of papain-like protease and chymotrypsin-like protease [37]. These reporters were then used to identify potential inhibitors of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [37]. These studies exemplify a wide applicability of this powerful technology to image the activity of many specific and regulated proteases.",

Constitutively active CAG promoter drives the expression of green fluorescent protein EGFP to determine the expression of transgene in various tissues. The EGFP coding sequence is flanked by loxP sites and a polyA signal with a strong termination sequence preventing the transcription of the downstream-located bioluminescent reporter construct (Fig. 3).The transgenic Caspase 3/7 reporter mice can be generated by pronuclear microinjection of the transgene containing the apoptosis reporter into fertilized eggs obtained from FVB/N females.Intercross the transgene reporter mice with a tissue-specific Cre-recombinase mouse (CMV-Cre or p48-Cre). Upon Cre-mediated recombination driven by CMV or p48 Cre expression, the EGFP lox-stop-lox cassette will be excised thus allowing for transcription of the reporter in Cre-expressing cells (Fig. 3).Genotyping can be done using the primers specified above (in Subheading 2.4) for CMV-Cre, p48Cre, and apoptosis reporter mice.To evaluate reporter activity, treat the mice with an agent that initiates the activation of apoptosis. In mice wherein the reporter is expressed within the pancreas (due to pancreatic expression of the Cre-recombinase in the P48-Cre animals), two series of 6 hourly intraperitoneal injections of cerulein can induce pancreatitis (75 \u03bcg/kg, total 12 injections in 48 h) [30].Perform bioluminescence imaging prior to treatment and 30 h posttreatment using the methodology described as above for imaging the xenografts [30] (see\nNote\n15).\n\n",

The cell lines should be selected based on literature search and experimentally.Clonal selection can be done by limited dilution method in 96-well plates. Alternately for picking up the clones, complete growth media with antibiotic is aspirated from the tissue culture dishes containing single-cell clones. Transfer sterilized filter paper discs pre-wetted in trypsin to the clones using sterilized forceps in a laminar flow hood. After 4\u20135 min, using sterilized forceps transfer the discs from thetissue culture plate to 24-well plate containing complete growth media with half the concentration of antibiotic used for clonal selection. Generally 12\u201324 single-cell clones are picked. Forceps can be sterilized by ethanol or by heating. Wait for the ethanol to evaporate before using the forceps to pick up the clones.The G418 concentration for stable clone selection should be empirically decided. For maintaining the stable cell lines, it is preferable to use half the concentration of G418 than that is used for selection.Perform all the bioluminescence acquisitions at 37 \u00b0C as the N-Luc and C-Luc fragments used in the construction of the complementation-based reporters have been optimized in mammalian cells at the physiological temperature (37 \u00b0C).The reporter is based on the complementation of the light-generating enzyme luciferase, and it works only in live cells under physiological conditions. Methods wherein cell lysates are used to measure the bioluminescence signal may be incompatible with this reporter system and may not be able to yield a desired signal to background (under different treatment conditions).The EnVision system is built with ultrasensitive luminescence detection technology. Even 0.01\u20130.1 s measurements for each well are usually sufficient. Also, the bioluminescence signal from GloSensor cAMP reagent is stable for a prolonged period of time and facilitates measurement of the protease activity for long-term studies.We have found that 400 \u03bcg luciferin/mouse gives the best signal-to-background bioluminescence readings for split firefly luciferase-based reporters. However amount of luciferin can be increased to 150 mg/kg body weight (i.e., 3.5\u20134 mg/mouse with 20\u201325 g average mouse weight) in case of smaller tumors or tumors generated from cell lines expressing very low levels of reporter.Generally 4\u20135 mice can be used in an experimental group for bioluminescence data acquisition on the IVIS imaging system. A stage level, i.e., the distance of the CCD camera from the subject, is selected and kept consistent for the entire experiment. Changing the stage level would lead to variations in photon counts, making it hard to analyze the data.It is important to test 2\u20133 different concentrations of the drug in the mouse tumor xenograft model to find the optimal concentration which gives highest-fold change over vehicle control without being toxic to animals.For analyzing the bioluminescence data, it is advisable to create similar ROIs for each tumor. The same ROI can be copied and pasted for each tumor for counting total photon flux for all the time points. However, the positioning of the ROI can be adjusted so that it covers the tumor without overlapping with the ROI of any adjacent tumor.The photon flux should be acquired without any saturated pixels. Data from saturated pixels cannot be accurately analyzed.Since luciferin bioavailability and peak intra-tumoral concentration vary from mouse to mouse, we consider only the maximum photon flux emitted from each tumor for analysis. Since each tumor may show the maximum emittance at different time points, it is helpful to perform sequential reads with a delay between each read.As a limitation of sensitivity of the imaging system, a minimal background signal is always observed in nude and SCID mice. If using a mouse strain with hair, the optical scatter can be minimized by shaving off the hair which will reduce the background.Any data obtained using bioluminescence images acquired in a mouse xenograft model should be independently validated by biochemical methods such as Western blotting or immunohistochemistry (IHC). For validation of the bioluminescence data for Caspase 3/7, tumor tissue should be analyzed using antibodies specific for activated Caspase 3 or PARP antibodies.\n",
