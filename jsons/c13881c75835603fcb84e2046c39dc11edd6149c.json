At the moment, delivery strategies across the BBB can be divided in invasive and non-invasive approaches; invasive approaches involve the temporary disruption of the BBB, the intraventricular, or the intracerebral administration, whereas non-invasive approaches involve the intravenous administration of the drug coupled to the carrier, which undergoes a receptor or adsorptive-mediated transcytosis or the intranasal route.

These cell membrane changes can be part of a pathological process that characterizes the viral infections and the propagation of the viral genetic content in the host cells. In fact, the latter requires the permeabilization of cell membranes in order to allow viral penetration. The alteration of intracellular vesicle trafficking is one of the major limits in the strategies based on the transfer of drugs or genes through the use of non-viral carriers that have poor side effects and are also poorly efficient because of the endosomal vesicle sequestration [51] . The subsequent fusion of these endosomes with lysosomes can induce the degradation of the pharmacologically active moiety with consequent reduced efficacy. In this light, viruses are a suitable tool in order to design strategies to stealth the endosomal-lysosomal pathway and the consequent drug sequestration [52, 53] . Peptide LAH4, from a family of His-rich peptides, has also been shown to complex DNA and efficiently deliver nucleic acids into eukaryotic cells by pH-triggered lysis of endosomes [54, 55] .

The peptide contains particular residues that are crucial for its capacity to interact with target lipid membranes. In particular, it is rich in hydrophobic residues that allow the peptide to enter into the bilayer and destabilize membranes. Fusion peptides are characterized by a typical amphipatic \u03b1-helix structure, which mediates lipid-protein interactions during the binding of proteins to membranes, thereby triggering membrane fusion and translocation [67] . Confocal microscopy studies on live cells showed the gH625 ability to cross membrane bilayers ( Figure 3) and translocate into the cytosol as compared with (transactivator of transcription protein from HIV-1) TAT peptide, which mainly enter cells by endocytosis [68] . A shorter version of this peptide (missing the first histidine at position 625) was investigated in a study by Tu and Kim [69] and found to enhance the transfection efficiency of cationic liposomes more than 30-fold in human cell lines improving the intracellular penetration of liposomes or lipoplexes. Another example of the suitability of gH625 is given by the effective delivery of intrinsically disordered proteins. A genetically modified recombinant gH625-c-prune was prepared through conjugation of c-prune with gH625. C-prune is the C-terminal domain of h-prune, overexpressed in breast, colorectal, and gastric cancers, interacting with multiple partners and representing an ideal target for inhibition of cancer development. Its C-terminal domain results in an intrinsically disordered domain and is easily transduced through biomembranes due to net negative charge of gH625 [70] . gH625-c-prune fusion protein exhibited the ability to cross biomembranes, opening a new scenario for the use of gH625 as a novel multifunctional carrier [68] .

Nanotechnology has the potential to create platforms that combine targeting and delivery with imaging and targeted cell uptake (theranostics), [72, 73] . Several classes of biomaterials can serve as platform for theranostics and are promising drug delivery carriers; they include nanocrystals, liposomes, virosomes, nanoemulsions, polymer protein conjugates, nanocomplexes, and nanoparticles [71, [74] [75] [76] [77] . According to the nanoparticle versatility, diagnostic and therapeutic drugs can be either physically encapsulated or covalently conjugated to nanoparticles (Figure 4) .

Liposomes, with size ranging in mean diameter from 50 to 300 nm, display unique pharmacokinetic properties and can be adapted to a wide range of therapeutic agents. Liposomes are non-toxic, biodegradable, and non-immunogenic; encapsulated drugs are protected from chemical or metabolic degradation after injection and their toxicity is reduced thanks to the decreased exposure of the drug to susceptible healthy tissues and increased antitumor activity resulting from a relatively long systemic circulation time (achieved through surface modification with polyethylene glycol or other polymers), an extended exposure, and tumor selective accumulation in sites of tumor growth. The association of a drug with liposomes markedly changes its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties and lowers systemic toxicity; moreover, in order to enhance the antitumor efficacy, many research groups are also working to improve cellular internalization of liposomes through the addition of surface ligands such as penetratin, TAT, and membranotropic [83, 84] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 532, "end": 536, "text": "[71]", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 682, "end": 686, "text": "[72,", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 687, "end": 690, "text": "73]", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 931, "end": 935, "text": "[71,", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 936, "end": 940, "text": "[74]", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 941, "end": 945, "text": "[75]", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 946, "end": 950, "text": "[76]", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}, {"start": 951, "end": 955, "text": "[77]", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}, {"start": 1658, "end": 1662, "text": "[78]", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}, {"start": 1663, "end": 1667, "text": "[79]", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}, {"start": 1668, "end": 1672, "text": "[80]", "ref_id": "BIBREF79"}, {"start": 1673, "end": 1677, "text": "[81]", "ref_id": "BIBREF80"}, {"start": 1678, "end": 1682, "text": "[82]", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}, {"start": 2726, "end": 2730, "text": "[83,", "ref_id": "BIBREF82"}, {"start": 2731, "end": 2734, "text": "84]", "ref_id": "BIBREF83"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1114, "end": 1124, "text": "(Figure 4)", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}], "section": "Modular Viral-based Vectors"}, {"text": "Dendrimers are hyperbranched polymeric molecules with a nearly perfect 3D geometrical architecture and their unique branched topologies provide a platform for coupling of drugs and targeting moieties [85] .

A typical example of natural molecular assemblies and containers is represented by virus-based nanoparticles, which are nanocages or nanorods assembled from capsid proteins of viruses obtained exploiting the recent and rapid advances in protein engineering and material science. Virus-like particles (VLPs) are multi-subunit protein complexes able to self-assemble and form higher-order structures mimicking native 3D conformation of viruses. The main difference with native viruses is that VLPs do not carry, hidden into the capsid protective shell, the viral genetic material but are empty cases or incorporate selected pieces of genetic material. Therefore, VLPs lacking a complete viral genome are unable to replicate and non-infectious. Over the last three decades, VLPs have been demonstrated very useful for the production of safe vaccines [97, 98] , and the first vaccine approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1986 was the vaccine against hepatitis B virus. From many points of view, VLPs are indistinguishable from VNP, in fact, the basic strategy behind the production of VLP and VNP is exactly the same: genetic engineering of capsid protein and their expression in microbial factories (e.g., bacteria, yeast, insect cells, mammalian cells, and plants). The principal difference is that VNPs are intended for creating novel material to be applied to the broader field of nanotechnology to solve different material-based problems and in the scope of the present review for drug delivery. Because of the appropriate size generally ranging from 20 to 200 nm, their homogeneity, possible functionalization, easy of modification through chemical and genetic routes, and possibility of convenient preparation and scale up in microbial factories VNP are emerging as the most promising platform for gene and drug delivery applications [12, 99, 100] .
