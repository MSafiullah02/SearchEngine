The PRV genome is large and difficult to manipulate, but it is feasible to use clustered, regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 technology. However, identification of single guide RNA (sgRNA) through screening is critical to the CRISPR/Cas9 system, and is traditionally time and labor intensive, and not suitable for rapid and high throughput screening of effective PRV sgRNAs. In this study, we developed a recombinant PRV strain expressing firefly luciferase and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) as a reporter virus for PRV-specific sgRNA screens and rapid evaluation of antiviral compounds. Luciferase activity was apparent as soon as 4 h after infection and was stably expressed through 10 passages. In a proof of the principle screen, we were able to identify several PRV specific sgRNAs and confirmed that they inhibited PRV replication using traditional methods. Using the reporter virus, we also identified PRV variants lacking US3, US2, and US9 gene function, and showed anti-PRV activity for chloroquine. Our results suggest that the reporter PRV strain will be a useful tool for basic virology studies, and for developing PRV control and prevention measures.",

However, a novel PRV variant has emerged in China, and the Bartha-K61 vaccine has failed to provide complete protection [3] [4] [5] [6] .

Both traditional methods have considerable drawbacks. For example, the frequency and efficacy of the expected recombination by HR is quite low; and BAC mutagenesis is only available for virus isolates for which a useful BAC has been produced. Therefore, CRISPR/Cas9 can be applied to new isolates as they emerge in nature, with the only delay being the need to have sequence data for design of guide RNAs. In addition, inserting drug selection markers or parts of BAC plasmids into the viral genome may affect viral function [10] . However, genetic manipulation is essential for identifying gene function and for vaccine development.",

These approaches use a nuclease to specifically target a gene, cleaving the DNA to induce double-stranded breaks at the target site. The DNA break triggers cellular DNA repair mechanisms, including error-prone non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homology-directed repair (HDR) [13] . Customizing gene disruption using either ZFNs or TALENs requires the design of specific proteins to target each dsDNA site [14, 15] , which requires several weeks and is labor and time intensive. However, gene knock out or gene knock in recombinants can be obtained within a short period by simply transfecting the CRISPR/Cas system, which is both efficient and convenient [16] [17] [18] .",

Then, site mutagenesis was utilized to insert the 5 1 BamHI and 3 1 NotI sites that flank the neomycin resistance gene. In addition, sites for EcoRI, SalI, and XhoI were created followed by an SV40 poly(A) signal sequence. Next, BamHI and NotI were used to remove the EGFP gene from the pEGFP-N1 plasmid (Clontech, PaloAlto, CA, USA) and used to replace the neomycin gene (Tang-EGFP vector). The firefly luciferase gene was then amplified from the pGL3-Basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and cloned into the Tang-EGFP vector between the NheI and PmeI sites. The right and left homologous arms were cloned from the PRV HeN1 strain by PCR and inserted between the CMV promoter and SV40 poly (A) signal. The final plasmid was termed the Tang-Luc-EGFP-HR vector. sgRNAs involved in this study were designed using the online CRISPR Design Tool [23] , and target the gE, US2, US3 and US9 genes open reading frames. A human codon-optimized SpCas9 and the chimeric guide RNA expression plasmid PX330 were gifts from Feng Zhang [17, 24] .

To generate the recombinant viruses, Vero cells were transfected with the purified PRV HeN1 genome, Tang-Luc-EGFP-HR, and gRNA-gE1 (a gE specific CRISPR/Cas9 construct that was used to improve the efficiency of the HR, our unpublished data). Forty-eight (48) hpi, the viruses were collected and plaque purified. After 10 rounds of purification, the expression of EGFP was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy ( Figure 1B ) and firefly luciferase expression was confirmed by luciferase activity ( Figure 1C ). The luciferase activity was detected as early as 4 hpi and reached a higher level at 36 h ( Figure 1C ). To determine whether the expression of firefly luciferase and EGFP influenced the replication of the PRV-Luc-EGFP virus, one-step growth curves were performed for PRV-HeN1 and PRV-Luc-EGFP. We found that PRV-Luc-EGFP replicated significantly slower than PRV-HeN1 ( Figure 1D ).

Luciferase expression was detectable as early as 4 hpi, suggesting that the reporter virus will be able to shorten assay time for antiviral screens and improve the assay sensitivity. In addition, when PRV genomes were cut by the CRISPR/Cas9 system, the luciferase expression was inhibited, indicating that the reporter virus is a powerful tool for identifying PRV specific sgRNAs, which will help us edit PRV genome more feasible. Finally, using the reporter virus, we successfully developed US2, US3, and US9 inactivated PRV strains, and demonstrated that chloroquine inhibits PRV replication, whereas CsA does not.",

The current luciferase based reporter system yields results in a much shorter timeframe (4 h), allowing a more rapid pace of vaccine development and basic research. For large genome viruses, the CRISPR/Cas9 system was a usable tool to insert foreign reporter genes in the genome as well [18, 21] .",

Exposure to a low intracellular pH is required for successful entry of many viruses. Chloroquine exerts direct antiviral effects by inhibiting pH-dependent steps of the virus lifecycle for some members of the flaviviruses, retroviruses, and coronaviruses [28] . Chloroquine has been showed to inhibit herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) replication [29] , and may inhibit PRV may by same mechanisms, but this remains to be confirmed. CsA is a fungal metabolite that exerts profound effects on the immune system and is potentially a selective immuno-suppressive agent [30] . The antiviral effects of CsA originate from inhibiting virus replication by blocking cyclophilins, which are beneficial for some viruses [31, 32] . CsA has been reported to inhibit replication of Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 [33] , Hepatitis C Virus [34, 35] , PRRSV, and Equine arteritis virus [31] . With regard to herpes viruses in particular, CsA has been shown to inhibit HSV-1 replication [36, 37] . Interestingly, in our study, CsA did not show any inhibitory activity against PRV in Vero cells. The lack of antiviral CsA-mediated antiviral activity may be because PRV replication is not associated with cyclophilins in Vero cells.",
