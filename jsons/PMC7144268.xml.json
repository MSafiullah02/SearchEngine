The primary driver of breathlessness is the viral lung infection causing an interstitial pneumonia with a reduction in lung diffusing capacity; in some patients this evolves to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The experience of breathlessness is also influenced by emotional, environmental, cultural and social factors, and optimal management requires a holistic approach. These include non-pharmacological and pharmacological approaches. Non-pharmacological approaches include breathing techniques [10]. Although an electric hand-held fan directed at the face is helpful in other settings [10, 11], this is not recommended in COVID-19 because of the theoretical infection control risk of spreading infected droplets. As an alternative, use of facial cooling with wet wipes (binning after each use, as for tissues) can be tried.",

Morphine is the opioid of choice [12, 13]. However, alternative strong opioids can be used. Short-acting oral opioids, given as required, may suffice when breathlessness is mild. However, in severe disease or at the end of life, continuous infusions of parenteral opioids are preferable, maximising symptom management whilst reducing nurse and community staff time, use of resource limited protective equipment and exposure. Use of the parenteral route is also preferred for speed of onset of action and ability to rapidly titrate doses. If there is distressing breathlessness at rest, opioids should be combined with an anxiolytic sedative, e.g. midazolam (table 1). Rapid titration of benzodiazepines may be needed. The primary role of oxygen is to correct hypoxaemia. There is a suggestion it may help breathlessness in severe hypoxaemia [14], but not when mild or absent [15]. In a comatose/unresponsive dying patient, oxygen can be titrated down with goal of discontinuation, while concurrently managing symptoms of breathlessness [16].\n",

Evidence for effective management of acute cough is limited [18, 19]. Adequate hydration and regular small sips of water may help [20]. However, because of the likely concurrent need for breathlessness management, strong opioids are likely to be more pragmatic in practice. High-level evidence is limited [21, 22], but relatively low doses of long-acting oral morphine (5\u201310 mg twice daily) are helpful in refractory chronic cough (table 1) [21]. Although these patients do not have chronic cough, opioids may be helpful in reducing cough alongside treatment for breathlessness [22].",

Most hospitals around the world will have chaplains/representatives from all faiths in the chaplaincy office. The family of the patient or the dying patient may want to see speak to someone about their impending death. Chaplain interventions, whether or not religious, focused on comforting the patient and improving his or her well-being in the context of both his or her spiritual pain and critical illness should be explored with all patients and carers [27].
