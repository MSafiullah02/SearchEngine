            "text": "\nPeritonitis is defined as inflammation of the peritoneal cavity and may be classified according to the underlying etiology (primary or secondary), extent (localized or generalized), or the presence of infectious agents (septic or nonseptic). Primary peritonitis refers to a spontaneous inflammatory condition in the absence of underlying intraabdominal pathology. Secondary peritonitis occurs more commonly and is the consequence of a preexisting aseptic or septic pathologic, intraabdominal condition. Secondary septic peritonitis is the more common form in the dog and cat, most commonly resulting from leakage of gastrointestinal (GI) contents from a compromised GI tract. Because of the multitude of conditions that may lead to peritonitis, the types of clinical signs and their severity are varied.",

Both microscopic and macroscopic foreign material, including surgical glove powder, surgical materials (suture, cotton swabs, surgical sponges), hair, and impaled objects (sticks, plant material, metal) may elicit a granulomatous response. To minimize iatrogenic causes of aseptic peritonitis, it is recommended that the surgeons rinse or wipe surgical gloves with sterile saline or use powder-free gloves, perform a surgical sponge count before opening and closing a celiotomy, and use surgical sponges with radiopaque markers.",

Leakage of GI contents may occur through stomach and intestinal walls that have been compromised by ulceration, foreign body obstruction, neoplasia, trauma, ischemic damage, or dehiscence of a previous surgical incision. Spontaneous gastroduodenal perforation may be associated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug administration but may also be seen with corticosteroid administration, neoplastic and nonneoplastic GI infiltrative disease, gastrinoma, and hepatic disease.1,2 GI linear foreign bodies in dogs have been reported to lead to the development of peritonitis in 41% of cases, higher than that previously reported for cats.3 Dehiscence occurs in 7% to 16% of postoperative patients requiring intestinal enterotomy or anastomosis, with mortality rates of 75% to 85% in this population. One study identified dogs as being at high risk for leakage following intestinal anastomosis if they had two or more of the following conditions: preoperative peritonitis, intestinal foreign body, and a serum albumin concentration of 2.5 g/dl or less.4 Other causes of septic peritonitis can be found in Box 133-1\n.Box 133-1Differential Diagnoses of Septic PeritonitisPrimary\nGDV, Gastric dilatation-volvulus.\nFeline coronavirus (feline infectious peritonitis)\nSalmonella typhimurium\n\nChlamydia psittaci\n\nClostridium limosum\n\nMesocestoides spp\nBlastomyces spp\nCandidiasis spp\nSecondary\nPenetrating abdominal woundsSurgical peritoneal contaminationPeritoneal dialysisGastrointestinal conditionsGastric rupture secondary to GDV, neoplasia, perforating ulcerIntestinal leakagePerforating foreign body, ulcer, or neoplasiaBacterial translocation secondary to obstruction (foreign body, neoplasia, intussusception, or bowel incarceration)Dehiscence of intestinal surgical woundIschemic intestinal injuryHepatobiliary conditionLiver abscessLiver lobe torsion with abscess formationRuptured biliary tract with bacterobiliaPancreatitis or pancreatic abscessHemolymphatic conditionsSplenic abscessSplenic torsion with anaerobic bacterial colonizationMesenteric lymph node abscess formationUrogenital conditionsRenal abscessSeptic uroabdomenPyometra (ruptured or with mural bacterial translocation)Uterine torsionProstatic abscess formation\n",

Abdominal pain may be appreciated on palpation, with a small number of dogs exhibiting the \u201cprayer position\u201d in an attempt to relieve abdominal discomfort. In a retrospective study focusing on cats with septic peritonitis, only 62% exhibited pain on palpation of the abdomen.5 Most animals with septic peritonitis are systemically ill and exhibit nonspecific clinical signs such as anorexia, vomiting, mental depression, and lethargy. It should be noted that animals with uroperitoneum may continue to urinate with a concurrent leakage into the peritoneal cavity. These patients may arrive in progressive states of hypovolemic and cardiovascular shock, with either injected or pale mucous membranes, prolonged capillary refill time, tachycardia with weak pulses, and with either hyperthermia or hypothermia reflecting poor peripheral perfusion.

The technique is performed by infusion of 22 ml/kg of a warmed, sterile isotonic saline solution through the catheter inserted in an aseptically prepared site just caudal to the umbilicus and retrieval of a sample for analysis and culture and sensitivity.

In the patient that has undergone a celiotomy, 7000 to 9000 cells/\u03bcl suggests mild to moderate peritonitis. In these patients, intracellular bacteria or increasing inflammation (numbers of neutrophils or morphologic features of toxicity in these cells) observed in serial samples correlated with clinical findings may prove more useful than single leukocyte counts in abdominocentesis samples when deciding whether reoperation is indicated.

Failing to meet nutritional demands, either with parenteral or enteral nutrition, may contribute to impaired wound healing and immune defenses. Enteral feeding is preferred over parenteral feeding but may be stymied by the anorectic patient unless GI feeding tubes were placed during the original surgery. If this was not done, nasoesophageal tubes can be placed in patients unable to tolerate more anesthesia or esophagostomy tubes in those that can. Animals with refractory vomiting typically require parenteral nutrition.",
