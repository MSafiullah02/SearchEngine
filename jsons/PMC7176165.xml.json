            "text": "The suspicion for MPE represents the leading diagnostic indication for medical thoracoscopy/pleuroscopy. Diagnostic pleuroscopy is often performed to evaluate an exudative pleural effusion for which no etiology can be identified despite performance of a thoracentesis with analysis of the pleural fluid and, if done, closed pleural biopsy. Pleuroscopy is particularly helpful and effective in diagnosing MPEs. In cases of suspected mesothelioma, for example, making the diagnosis can be difficult using cytological examination of pleural fluid and histological examination of the small samples obtained by closed-needle pleural biopsy. Pleuroscopy improves the diagnostic yield for mesothelioma to above 90%. As another example, pleuroscopy can be used in patients with known bronchogenic carcinoma who have cytologically negative pleural effusions. Since only 6% of such patients will have completely resectable tumors, medical thoracoscopy can be used to identify the small group who could potentially benefit from surgical resection while preventing surgery for the majority with unresectable disease.",

The main advantage of pleuroscopy is the ability to achieve early diagnosis of MPE when pleural fluid cytology and closed-needle pleural biopsy have failed. It allows inspection of approximately 75% of the visceral pleural surface as well as of the parietal pleural surface (Fig. 64.1). Boutin reported that in 85% of patients with MPE, thoracoscopy revealed visual features suggestive of malignancy, including nodules, polypoid lesions, localized masses, thickened pleural surface, and poorly vascularized pachypleuritis. However, since appearances can be misleading \u2013 some malignancies may appear inflammatory while some inflammatory lesions can look like tumors \u2013 macroscopic diagnoses must always be confirmed by histology. Biopsies can be visually directed in instances where tumor deposits appear to be localized (Figs. 64.2 and 64.3). In addition, biopsy specimens can be obtained from multiple sites and are of greater size and depth, factors that improve the diagnostic yield (Figs. 64.4 and 64.5). The larger sample sizes increases the ability of the pathologist to make an accurate diagnosis; the pathologist, for example, can better differentiate malignant mesothelioma from adenocarcinoma and can perform special studies such as hormone receptor assays or genetic marker studies on the tissue that help determine prognosis and guide therapy.\n\n\n\n\n",

In addition to playing an integral role in the diagnosis of a MPE, thoracentesis also plays a central role in the palliative treatment when a large volume of pleural fluid is drained. Indeed, if a MPE is strongly suspected in a patient with a newly noted pleural effusion, both a diagnostic and therapeutic thoracentesis can be combined in one procedure. By draining a large volume of fluid, one can assess whether the patient\u2019s symptoms, \u00adparticularly dyspnea, improve and whether the underlying lung reexpands radiographically. If symptoms significantly improve, other drainage procedures can be planned such as tube drainage and pleurodesis. If symptoms do not improve, other causes of the dyspnea should be considered, including underlying lung or heart disease, venous thromboembolism, chemotherapy- or radiation therapy-induced lung injury, tumor emboli, or pulmonary lymphangitic tumor spread. If the lung does not reexpand to touch the chest wall, one must consider pleural adhesions or lung entrapment by tumor preventing full expansion or atelectasis due to endobronchial obstruction by tumor. Such findings can affect diagnostic and treatment decisions; for example, diagnostic and therapeutic bronchoscopy might be indicated for endobronchial tumor obstruction, or pleurodesis might not be attempted if the visceral and parietal pleural surfaces cannot be apposed because of trapped lung.",

Pleural manometry, although not yet widely adopted, can be helpful in identifying patients with trapped lung because of abnormally negative intrapleural pressures and may also help prevent reexpansion pulmonary edema by stopping drainage when intrapleural pressures exceed \u221220 cm H2O (or when patients experience chest discomfort, which can be a surrogate for extremely negative intrapleural pressures.) The American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the most recent British Thoracic Society (BTS) practice guidelines continue to recommend limiting fluid withdrawal to <1.5 L during thoracentesis to avoid reexpansion pulmonary edema, in the absence of pleural manometry.",

Prevention of fluid recurrence is most often achieved with chemical pleurodesis, which involves the instillation of a sclerosing agent into the pleural space. Several sclerosing agents have been used and described, all of which are meant to cause inflammation with fibrin deposition and consequent adhesion between the visceral and parietal pleural surfaces, thus preventing pleural fluid reaccumulation. Successful chemical pleurodesis requires the apposition of the pleural surfaces and thus reexpansion (at least partial, if not full) of the lung after pleural fluid drainage.",

For chest tube drainage, the current BTS guidelines for the management of malignant pleural effusions recommend the insertion of a small-bore intercostal tube, controlled evacuation of fluid (initial drainage of 1.5 L, and 1.5 L at a time every 2 h) to prevent reexpansion pulmonary edema and radiographic confirmation of chest tube placement and lung reexpansion.",

The sclerosant of choice can be instilled as soon as the pleural effusion has been drained and when there is radiographic evidence of lung expansion; instillation does not need to be delayed until there is a predetermined amount of daily fluid drainage.

Meta-analyses have consistently identified talc as having the highest efficacy (whether given as a slurry through a chest tube or by poudrage during thoracoscopy) with success rates ranging from 70% to 100%. The typical dose of talc when given as a slurry is 5.0 g diluted in 50\u2013100 ml of normal saline. Common adverse effects of talc, likely secondary to pleural inflammation, include pain and discomfort, fever (which is common and often transient), hypoxemia (in up to 30% of patients), and dyspnea. Less common side effects include pneumonia, arrhythmias, and empyema. Acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to talc has been described by several authors and does not appear to be related to dose or method of delivery but may be related to talc particle size. The talc available in Europe (mean particle size >20 \u03bcm) has not been reported to cause ARDS, as opposed to the talc available in the United States (the only FDA-approved preparation is Sclerosol\u00ae), which contains particles <10 \u03bcm. It has been hypothesized that talc with smaller particle sizes (<10 \u03bcm) can be systemically absorbed into the vascular beds and cause an inflammatory reaction in the lung resulting in an acute pneumonitis or ARDS. The incidence of respiratory failure in patients with MPE receiving talc slurry for pleurodesis was 4% in a prospective randomized trial. Despite the potential adverse effects, talc remains the most commonly used pleural sclerosant because of its wide availability, low expense, and good efficacy.",

There are several theoretical advantages to thoracoscopic talc insufflation compared with talc slurry sclerosis. Medical thoracoscopy allows complete effusion drainage under direct visualization and optimal chest tube positioning. Talc is insufflated in a manner that allows even distribution over the entire visceral and parietal pleural surfaces. In contrast, the slurry of water-insoluble talc may gravitate to the dependent part of the pleural space shortly after instillation. Finally, in patients with an underlying malignancy but negative fluid cytology, parietal pleural biopsies of suspicious areas can be taken at the time of medical thoracoscopy, before proceeding with pleurodesis. A systematic review comparing the various treatment options to achieve pleurodesis in patients with MPE was published in the Cochrane Database in 2004. The comparison of thoracoscopic talc pleurodesis (TTP) and talc slurry pleurodesis favored thoracoscopic pleurodesis, with a relative risk for nonrecurrence of the effusion of 1.19 (95% CI, 1.04\u20131.36).\n\n",

It should be demonstrated that drainage of the fluid results in symptom relief, that pleurodesis is achievable since the lung is expandable, that the patient can tolerate moderate sedation required for thoracoscopy, and that the patient can tolerate the procedure itself. In a study examining predictors of survival in patients with symptomatic MPE referred for TTP, the authors concluded that performance status, as measured by the Karnofsky score, was the best predictor. The authors proposed that a Karnofsky score \u226570 (which reflects a patient who is ambulatory and living independently) may be a reasonable marker for deciding which patients with MPE should undergo TTP. In patients with MPE, overall prognosis should thus be considered in the selection of patients for TTP. As an example, a patient with MPE who has a Karnofsky score of \u226570 and an expected prognosis of more than 6 months might be an excellent candidate for TTP, whereas other options (such as tunneled pleural catheters, which will be described later, or palliative care) should be considered for a patient with a poor performance status and an expected survival of less than 1\u20132 months.",

A recent pilot study in which a tunneled pleural catheter (described in more detail below) was placed at the time of medical thoracoscopy and left in at the time of patient discharge for frequent, intermittent drainage showed that pleurodesis was achieved in 92% of 30 patients. The median duration of hospitalization following the procedure was 1.79 days, and the tunneled pleural catheter was removed at a median of 7.54 days. The placement of a tunneled pleural catheter at the time of medical thoracoscopy and talc poudrage can potentially allow earlier discharge and shortening of a hospitalization.",

A major advantage of using a TPC is that it can be placed in the ambulatory setting, making hospitalization unnecessary and allowing the patient to return home. Furthermore, it has been reported that pleurodesis can occur even without the instillation of sclerosant. It may also be useful in relieving dyspnea in patients with trapped lung in whom pleurodesis cannot be achieved. It does require knowledge of basic sterile technique and the intermittent drainage of pleural fluid through the TPC by the patient or the patient\u2019s caregiver.\n",
