Randomized controlled trials (RCT) proved them to have globally acceptable safety and tolerability profiles. However, life-threatening complications are rare events and RCT are underpowered to detect them. As these drugs became more widely prescribed in clinical practice, and particularly, having the information from multiple national biologics registries available, serious adverse events became perceptible. Infection remains the major concern, but other serious and life-threatening complications have emerged, such as malignancies, congestive heart failure, demyelinating disorders, and drug-induced autoimmune syndromes. Several of these are correlated with either the underlying disease or concomitant immunosuppressive medication. Most of them can be avoided by the adoption of preventive measures and an early proper management might significantly change the outcome. Awareness of the possible serious side effects is of utmost importance for a safer use of biological agents.",

However, RCT are underpowered to detect specific risks (particularly rare events) due to short duration of follow-up, relatively small number of patients studied, and exclusion of those with risk factors for complications. During post-approval surveillance, increased risks of serious infections (including opportunistic), malignancies, congestive heart failure, demyelinating disorders, and drug-induced autoimmune syndromes have been reported. [2] [3] [4] Nonetheless, these findings have been inconsistent and the reported risks and frequencies differ widely (Table 23. 2). [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Recognized limitations of the different sources of safety data (post-marketing surveillance reports, national registries and meta-analyses), such as lack of a control group and channeling or confounding by indication bias, underlie this variability. 12, 13 Different mechanisms of drug action and their diverse pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics characteristics influence their safety profile, including the risk of serious adverse events (SAE) ( Table 23 .1). Patients with ARD have a higher mortality compared to general population, due to increased susceptibility to infections, malignancy, and cardiovascular disorders. [14] [15] [16] [17] The underlying immune deregulation of these diseases, the concomitant immunosuppression by conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) and steroids, and the frequent existence of comorbidities are recognized as major factors. These complex interactions make it difficult to ascribe complications solely to biological agents.",

            "text": "Infection remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in autoimmune diseases, particularly RA and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and these patients appear to have increased baseline susceptibility for infection, including serious and opportunistic infections. [14] [15] [16] [17] In patients with RA, a twofold increased incidence of infections was estimated in the prebiologics era. 14, 18 In SLE, infection is responsible for approximately 25% of all deaths. The prevalence of life-threatening infections appears to be highest within the first 5 years of the disease onset. [15] [16] [17] Immunosuppressive therapy, including steroids, also plays a key role. 15, 16 The potential from biological therapies to increase infection risk has been a major concern. They have been associated with a widely variable increased incidence of severe and non-severe infections. An increased incidence of TB and opportunistic infections associated with biologic treatments is evident, and some are fatal. Likewise, new infections or reactivation of latent viral infections resulting in serious complications or death are also . This risk appears to be somewhat higher with anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies (particularly Infliximab), compared to Etanercept, although not all studies agree. 6, 20 The large induction dose of Infliximab, Etanercept's lower half-life, and different mechanistic properties between the two anti-TNF antibodies might account for these differences. 6, 18, 22, 26 Lifethreatening infections are more common in patients with risk factors (Table 23 .5) 18,26 and usually result from disseminated disease and/or severe pulmonary infections progressing to respiratory failure. A common feature in fatal cases is the paucity of signs or symptoms indicating the severity of developing infections. Pneumococcal pneumonias can rapidly progress to fatal acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and septic shock. Atypical clinical presentation poses a problem in the differential diagnosis with a flare of the underlying disease, as clinical and laboratory signs of infection might be \"blunted\" in patients on anti-TNF therapy (e.g., absence of fever and elevated acute inflammatory markers). Occasionally, both problems are present. Distinguishing pneumonia and interstitial lung disease secondary to lung involvement and infectious meningitis/encephalitis and central nervous system (CNS) involvement of the diseases can be hard. Estimated death rates attributed to serious infections are generally not available, as these are generally calculated for total SAE. The risk for perioperative infections has rarely been addressed: Two studies showed that therapy interruptions before surgery did not significantly decrease the risk for infectious complications, though a recent study suggested that this risk was twofold lower in patients who stopped the drug for 28 days pre-surgery. [27] [28] [29] Few studies have analyzed rates of serious infections in patients treated with other biologic agents. Results from major RCT in patients with RA 7, 8, 30, 31 and other ARD 32 treated with Rituximab did not show a significant increase in serious infections. Infections of the lower respiratory tract seem more frequent, but are rarely severe. Even the presence of hypogammaglobulinemia (which only occurs with repeated cycles of Rituximab) does not correlate with a significant increase in serious infections. However, levels of the immunoglobulin (Ig) of the IgG isotype below 500 mg/dL are a concern (particularly if sustained for long periods). 33, 34 In case reports of patients with severe pneumonia, concomitant immunosuppressives are invariably being taken. Nonetheless, the biologic effects post-Rituximab on memory B cells and Ig levels, with the concomitant modulation of T-cell immunity, require further investigation. 34 Common infections -Comorbidities (e.g., diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease, chronic renal failure) -Previous splenectomy -Concomitant immunosuppressive medication (particularly steroids) -Immunodeficiency (primary or acquired) -Hypogammaglobulinemia (primary or acquired -e.g., Rituximab) severe (IgG a < 500 mg/dL) or prolonged -Elderly -Active underlying autoimmune disease Opportunistic infections (global risks for all opportunistic infections) -Immunosuppression: primary or acquired (e.g., exposure to immunosuppressive medication -particularly steroids, HIV b infection, transplanted persons) -Comorbidities (chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus, chronic heart failure, chronic lung disease) -Tuberculosis -Birth or extended living in high-endemic country for TB c -Risk contacts for TB (recent contact with an active case, history of substance abuse, incarceration, living in homeless shelter or nursing home or contact with persons in these conditions; recent travel in endemic areas) -Occupational exposure to TB (employment in health care system) -Chest radiograph abnormalities (chronic lung diseaseparticularly silicosis, signs suggestive of previous TB) -Nontuberculous mycobacteria infections -Risk exposure (e.g., fishing)",

Anakinra's increased risk was correlated to the presence of comorbidities. 25 Studies on Tocilizumab safety did not report an increase in serious infections compared to biologic-na\u00efve RA controls. 10 Prevention and management: Immunization against Pneumococcus is recommended before (2-3 weeks) the initiation of anti-TNF treatment. Exclusion of hypogammaglobulinemia is warranted for candidates to biological therapy (particularly Rituximab) and the evaluation should be repeated before additional courses or in the event of an active infection. A high level of suspicion for infection is necessary, particularly in patients with baseline risk factors (Table 23 .5). 18, 26 Once symptoms become clinically overt, severe sepsis must be anticipated and immediate discontinuation of the biological therapy (anti-TNF agents) is essential as well as prompt evaluation. Appropriate preemptive antibiotic therapy should be initiated until infection is definitely ruled out. Support treatment with intravenous Ig (IVIg) might be provided as an individual case decision and according to other risk factors. 33 ",

Being born in a TB-endemic country is a major risk factor, which may be elevated up to ~10-fold (OR 10.35; 95% CI, 2.40-44.55). 43 Other frequent risk factors include older age and concomitant use of corticosteroids (Table 23 .5). 40, 43 The clinical presentation can be atypical and is dominated by extrapulmonary disease, occurring in 60-70% of cases, with a significant percentage (>25%) of these presenting disseminated TB. Unusual sites of infection (e.g., meningoencephalitis, gastrointestinal, spondylodiscitis) are also more commonly seen. Most cases of TB occur soon after the initiation of treatment, especially with Infliximab. However, a significant number of disseminated TB cases in patients treated with Adalimumab occurred after therapy has been stopped (>3 months). 43 Whether the risk of TB infection is a class effect of the anti-TNF agents is still debated, although most studies conclude that treatment with anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies confers a higher risk of this complication (up to three-to fourfold in most reports) (Table 23.7) . 37, 40, 44 Different drug pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics and mechanisms of action (e.g., antibodies' apoptosis-inducing activity, different avidities of the agents for soluble versus transmembrane TNF, and the irreversibly high and fast binding to TNF exhibited by Infliximab compared with Etanercept) potentially explain the dissimilar risks of TB development. 44 A dissimilar action of the two types of anti-TNF agents on specific effector T cells and Treg cells has also been suggested. 43 In addition, differences in the time to develop TB are apparent. For Infliximab, most cases occur sooner after the treatment (first 90 days) than for Adalimumab and Etanercept (median interval above 1 year). These differences suggest that Infliximab-related TB cases are particularly related to reactivation of latent TB, whereas the linearity of the TB infection curve until late phases of treatment with Etanercept is related to reactivation and probably to new infections. 44 Screening procedures for the diagnosis and proper treatment of latent TB before initiating anti-TNF therapy reduce significantly the incidence of the infection. 45, 46 However, cutaneous anergy Antirheumatic Treatment in Sweden is more common in RA patients. Indeed, studies from the French registry report that twothirds of TB cases during anti-TNF therapy occurred in patients with negative tuberculin skin testing (TST) at screening. 43 The frequent atypical presentations, the potential false-negative screening tests, and the occurrence of TB after discontinuation of anti-TNF therapy warrant a high level of suspicion for the possibility of this infection, when using these drugs, particularly monoclonal antibodies.",

The threshold for considering latent TB should be lowered in high-risk patients (considering as positive an induration \u00b35 mm in the TST). Blood-based diagnostic assays, such as QuantiFERON-TB or T-Spot TB, have greater specificity and are preferred in patients previously vaccinated with bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), as false-negative TST results are more common among them. A diagnosis of latent TB warrants the exclusion of active infection before initiation of prophylactic medication. The optimal interval between initiation of preventive treatment and starting TNF blockers is unknown, but observational data suggest that initiating anti-TNF therapy after 1 month of prophylactic treatment for latent TB substantially decreases the risk of reactivation. Likewise, the lag period between initiation of treatment of active TB and starting anti-TNF agents is not defined, but this appears safe after 2 months of treatment for TB. 1 Precise guidelines on re-testing patients are not defined, but latest recommendations suggest that in areas of high TB prevalence, or in the event of potential TB exposure, repeat testing should be considered.",

However, some studies included patients without previous screening for latent TB and the results have not shown an increased incidence of TB infection. Differences in the mechanism of action between these new agents and anti-TNF drugs might also cause variance in the risk.

High rates of mortality are reported in patients receiving biologic treatment diagnosed with IFI, particularly with respect to aspergillosis, disseminated candidiasis, and cryptococcosis (ranging from 50% to 100%), and somewhat less with histoplasmosis (20%). 50, 51 The time for recognition and treatment appears to influence significantly the clinical course and outcome. Host conditions (e.g., neutropenia, environmental exposure) are also determinant factors in the severity of IFI. 51 Infliximab is the biologic agent most commonly reported (an estimated increased risk of granulomatous infections 3.25-fold higher with Infliximab versus Etanercept is reported 26 ), but all anti-TNF agents and the other biologic agents may be implicated. Most infections occurred soon after the start of treatment, particularly with Infliximab (median: \u00a33 infusions). 26, 50, 51 Close surveillance, a high level of suspicion, and prompt treatment of these life-threatening complications are essential, particularly in high-risk populations (Table 23.

            "text": "Serious viral infections, including primary varicella, herpes zoster, and cytomegalovirus infections, have been reported, especially after treatment with anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies and, to a lesser extent, Rituximab. Fatal or life-threatening cases are related to disseminated disease or involvement of major internal organs (e.g., pneumonia, fulminant hepatitis). 4, 48, 52 Influenza can also cause serious infections in these patients and is associated with secondary bacterial infections, which may progress to sepsis. 26 An FDA alert in 2006 about the possibility of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) in patients with ARD receiving B-cell depletion raised an additional concern. PML is a rare, serious, and usually fatal demyelinating disease, which occurs upon reactivation of JC virus, predominantly in severely immunosuppressed populations (such as persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)). Up to 92% of the adult population is seropositive for JC virus, without clinical disease. However, recent reviews found that immunosuppressed persons other than HIV-positive, notably those with ARD, may have an intrinsically raised risk of developing PML. It appears that SLE patients are at the highest risk. 53 As a complication of Rituximab therapy, it was first described in oncology. More recently, five cases of PML have been reported (as of February 2010): two in patients with SLE and one case each in other three different ARD. 54, 55 Median time from last Rituximab dose to PML diagnosis was 5.5 months, and the median time to death was 2 months. The mortality rate reached 90%. CD4 + T lymphopenia was associated with cases occurring sooner after the treatment and carrying higher mortality. 54 All patients were receiving concomitant immunosuppressive therapy, at varying intensities. The link between Rituximab use and the development of PML is unclear, as more than 20 patients with SLE not taking Rituximab have been reported to develop PML. Close surveillance remains necessary though, as early diagnosis is crucial. However, differentiating PML from the new-onset or exacerbation of CNS complications in various ARD can be difficult, such as in acute neuropsychiatric SLE or CNS vasculitis. 53, 54 Despite the possibility of underlying undiagnosed PML as the etiology of some cases of demyelinating disorders occurring in patients on anti-TNF therapy, so far, there are no reports of confirmed PML associated with these agents. 56 Prevention and management: Influenza vaccination should be provided to candidates to anti-TNF and Rituximab therapies. CD4 + T lymphopenia <200/mm 3 precludes B-cell depletion therapy. New-onset or aggravated neurological symptoms and signs in patients on biological therapy should raise the possibility of PML as a potential cause. Neuroimaging studies and a Neurology opinion can help in the differential diagnosis. The gold standard for the definitive diagnosis relies on brain biopsy with histological and virological examinations. However, less invasive detection of JC virus DNA (by protein chain reaction analysis) of the cerebrospinal fluid has a high specificity (though lower sensitivity), being the most commonly used test. Prompt efforts at immune reconstitution may improve survival rates, as currently available antiviral treatment appears essentially ineffective. 54,55",

While earlier studies and meta-analysis of RCT 5,19,63 indicated the possibility of an increased risk of several types of cancer, and particularly of lymphoma, in patients treated with anti-TNF therapy (particularly with higher doses), observational data and posterior studies (which included larger cohorts and longer follow-up periods) have not been able to replicate these findings. [64] [65] [66] Overall and based on the results of the most reliable latest studies, the use of TNF antagonists appears to be associated with slightly increased risk only of skin malignancies (namely, non-melanotic skin cancer OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.2-1.8 and melanoma OR 2.3, 95% CI 0.9-5.4). 66 This increased risk appears to affect predominantly patients with previous history of melanoma. Patients with low risk for malignancy treated with TNF blockers do not seem to be at an increased risk for other solid cancers nor for any major further increase in the already elevated lymphoma occurrence in RA. No trend toward an increased incidence or relative risk seems to exist over time (6 years posttreatment) either. 64",

In such instances, therapy should be stopped and supportive or emergent care should be administered until patient stabilisation.

Delayed hypersensitivity infusion reactions (occurring 2-12 days after infusion) are more rare (<1%) and seem to be mediated by different pathophysiological mechanisms (involving immunoglobulin E). Clinical features are similar to those described for acute reactions, but rapidly progressing interstitial lung disease with ARDS and respiratory failure seem more common. Most events occurred with the third or fourth infusion. Histologically available data revealed eosinophilic pneumonia, and human antichimeric antibodies (HACA) also appear to be common. 4 Most reports refer to patients with Crohn's disease with long treatment-free intervals, but similar reactions in patients with other autoimmune diseases treated with Infliximab are recognized.

TNF-a is a mediator of endothelial dysfunction, vascular instability, and disease progression in atherosclerosis and is known to contribute to the progression of heart failure. 73, 74 However, Etanercept and Infliximab treatments for severe heart failure have not been successful. 73 The issue of prescribing anti-TNF agents to patients with diagnosis of or risk factors for heart failure is controversial. There have been several post-marketing reports of new-onset and worsening of congestive heart failure (CHF) in patients receiving anti-TNF therapy, including cases of de novo CHF in young patients without identifiable cardiovascular risk factors. 2, 3 The median interval from the first dose of TNF antagonist to a diagnosis of new-onset or exacerbation of CHF was 3.5-4 months (ranging from 24 h to several months).

Arrhythmias reported include ventricular tachycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and trigeminy. Angina and myocardial infarction have been rarely reported following its administration. Rare, fatal heart failure with symptomatic onset weeks after Rituximab has occurred. It remains unknown what, if any, role the drug had in these incidents. Patients with ARD who develop significant cardiopulmonary events should have Rituximab discontinued, and it should be used with caution in those with severe CHF (NYHA class IV). 1 No significant increased short-term risk of serious cardiovascular events has been reported, so far, in association with Abatacept and Tocilizumab. 9,48",

            "text": "Although a variety of autoantibodies have been noted to develop after the introduction of TNF-a blockers, 3, 4, 75, 76 the appearance of clinical autoimmune syndromes is much less frequent (vasculitis up to 3.9%, lupus <0.5%). Most cases are mild diseases, which resolve after discontinuation of the drug. 2, 4, 75 Nevertheless, a growing number of reports of autoimmune processes related to TNF antagonists use have documented rare cases with serious, lifethreatening or even fatal complications. 75 The most frequent clinical presentations consist of vasculitis -with an impressive ~25% having extracutaneous involvement (peripheral and central nervous system, renal and lung) -lupus-like syndromes and SLE (with articular, cutaneous, and constitutional symptoms, being the most common features) and interstitial lung disease (ILD). Less frequent clinical features include inflammatory myopathies, antiphospholipid syndrome, and autoimmune hepatitis. 75 The three anti-TNF agents display different risks for the diverse autoimmune disorders, with Infliximab being the most frequently implicated, except for vasculitis where Etanercept has the strongest association. The interval between administration of the drug and the appearance of the autoimmune syndrome varies between 6 and 10 months. Generally, these disorders are self-limiting after stopping anti-TNF therapy but may require corticosteroids and immunosuppressive treatment. 75, 76 However, significant morbidity and mortality has also been seen. Reported causes of death were related to renal involvement of vasculitis, with rapidly progressive anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA)-positive glomerulonephritis, and relentless progression of interstitial lung disease. 75 A case series found a significant poor prognosis in patients with induced ILD in spite of cessation of anti-TNF therapy and initiation of corticosteroids and immunosuppressives, with more than one half of patients showing no resolution and ~33% dying. 75 Precise etiopathogenic link between these autoimmune diseases and TNF blockade remains unclear. An underlying predisposition of some patients for a second autoimmune disease (particularly in RA), given that some of them already had these autoantibodies prior to the anti-TNF therapy and the contribution or synergistic action of concomitant medication (particularly methotrexate in ILD) are confounding factors. 75, 76 With respect to lupus, some authors refer to a new concept -anti-TNF-induced lupus (ATIL) -as being apparently distinct from classical drug-induced lupus (DIL) and with a phenotype more similar to idiopathic SLE (namely: cerebral and renal involvement and anti-doublestranded DNA (dsDNA) antibodies are more common, while anti-histone antibodies are less frequent, when compared to classical DIL). 76 Prevention and management: Careful clinical and immunological screening for features suggestive of the existence of undiagnosed autoimmune disease prior to and during anti-TNF therapy is important. Screening of candidates for underlying ILD is recommended, particularly in those receiving methotrexate. Anti-TNF agents should not be used in patients with preexisting interstitial pulmonary disorders. Confirmation of an autoimmune disease induced by these agents should be followed by the drug withdrawal, unless the symptoms are very mild. 75 The other biological therapies (Rituximab, Abatacept, Tocilizumab) have rarely been reported to induce autoantibody formation or clinical manifestations (e.g., skin vasculitis with Rituximab). Serious/life-threatening autoimmune syndromes do not appear to be associated with their use. 1,9",

[1] [2] [3] [4] These include new-onset optic neuritis, de novo multiple sclerosis (MS), recurrence or flare of MS, encephalitis, myelitis, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, neuropathy, transverse myelitis, and leukoencephalopathy, while receiving either three of the anti-TNF agents. Etanercept has been the most often drug implicated, particularly in CNS adverse events. The mean time to symptom onset from initiation of therapy is 5 months, ranging from 1 week to 15 months. 77 Most cases show changes in magnetic resonance imaging consistent with demyelination. Other than a prior history of MS or other demyelinating diseases, no predictive factors have been identified and cases exist in patients with no history of neurological disorder. 3 In most cases, symptoms improve or resolve with cessation of therapy, but rarely neurological deficits persist. The etiopathogenesis of these demyelinating disorders occurring in patients receiving TNF inhibitors is not fully understood.",

However, some patients required corticosteroids or IVIg for treatment. The reasons linking the cytopenias and TNF blockade remain unclear and concomitant medication or other comorbidities may also be responsible. 3 Periodic monitoring (every 3-6 months) of blood cell counts is suggested as well as close surveillance for clinical features of blood dyscrasias. 2 Severe (grade 3 or 4) cytopenias (most commonly lymphopenia) following Rituximab administration have been observed essentially in oncology, where confounding factors for the etiology (including concomitant chemotherapy and reactivation of Parvovirus B19 infection) are important. 26 However, a specific complication of this biological agent -lateonset neutropenia (LON) -has been recognized and reported in patients receiving B-cell depletion for the treatment of ARD. 79 It occurs usually 40 days (or more) after the last dose of rituximab (ranging from 2 to 6 months) and the median duration is 10 days. In some cases, it can be accompanied by serious complications, such as febrile severe neutropenia (requiring growth-factor support) or serious infections. The underlying mechanism is unknown.

However, cases without these risk factors have also been reported. Most cases occur after the second or third treatments. Histologically, usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) has been the most frequent finding, particularly in the fatal cases 80 ; less frequently, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) has been found. The pathophysiology of the pulmonary insult is unknown, and in some cases, it may be autoantibody mediated. Caution and close screening before and after initiation of anti-TNF therapy is recommended, particularly in patients with previous history of lung disease and/or concomitant pneumotoxic medication. However, excluding an infectious complication (with particular focus for atypical pathogens) is mandatory before assuming any other diagnosis, 81 particularly if treatment with corticosteroids is being considered.",
