Its causative agent, known as SARS-CoV-2, has spread rapidly causing a global pandemic of pneumonia affecting more than 3M people with more than 200,000 deaths to date [1] . Global spread of SARS-CoV-2 was primarily driven by international movement of people, since travel-associated cases of COVID-19 were reported outside of China as early as mid-January 2020 [2] . This global health emergency has deployed international efforts to apply genomic epidemiology to track the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in real time. The recent development of targeted sequencing protocols by the ARTIC Network [3] , open sharing of genomic data through the GISAID (www.gisaid.org) database and straightforward bioinformatic tools for viral phylogenomics [4] , provides the opportunity to reconstruct global spatio-temporal dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic with unprecedented comprehensiveness and resolution.",

C3-UY likely originated from European viruses circulating in Spain since Jan 21 th (CI: Jan 7 th -Feb 5 th ). The last common ancestor of C3-UY in Uruguay was tracked to Mar 4 th (CI: Feb 23 rd -Mar 11 th ) (Fig. 5) . Two viruses from Chile were intermingled between viruses from Spain and Uruguay, indicating regional circulation of these variants. Together, these results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 could be circulating in the country previous to its first detection in Mar 13 th .",

International air transport has likely played a central role in the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2, contributing to the current COVID-19 pandemic. According to air transport statistics from the World Bank (https://data.worldbank.org) and the National Government We estimated these introductions could have occurred as early as mid-February, around 1 month before first cases were reported in Uruguay in March 13 th . This is in line with observations from other geographic regions, for example, in New York first cases were confirmed in March but a recent study suggested that initial virus introductions could be traced back to February 20 th [10] . Also, the virus was likely introduced in Europe by a traveler that arrived from Wuhan to France, but the recent identification of a group of ill Chinese tourists in France previous to this case supports earlier introductions [11] . Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 has been proposed to circulate in humans even before its first detection in December 2019 [12] .",

The application of rapid genomic epidemiology during local outbreaks allows to identify main routes of virus introduction and estimate spatio-temporal dynamics which can be used to improve contingency measures. Remarkably, tracking the emergence of local genetic variants like those we observed in Montevideo, is important to evaluate the sensibility of molecular diagnosis and potential impacts on future anti-viral strategies. Subsequent generation of a more comprehensive genomic dataset from the ongoing outbreak in Uruguay will allow us to identify domestic transmission patterns and spatio-temporal characterization of local clusters. Additionally, setting up coordinated efforts to generate genomic data in South America will allow us to perform integrative analyses to uncover SARS-CoV-2 dynamics at the continental level. ",
