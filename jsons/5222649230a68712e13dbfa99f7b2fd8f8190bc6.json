Overgrowth and abnormal wear may result in sharp points and edges to the teeth as well as fractures of the tooth. These sharp edges traumatize the oral cavity, leading to gingivitis, stomatitis, and glossitis. The common presentation of dental disease is lethargy, anorexia, Staphylococcal enterocolitis is a complication of antibiotic therapy, particularly broad-spectrum antibiotics, in chinchillas. 7 The bacterial overgrowth results in a fatal diarrhea and lesion of an ulcerative pseudomembranous enterocolitis.",

The portal of entry is generally by ingestion of food or water contaminated by excreta from wild rodents and birds and rarely through the conjunctiva. Salmonella infections can range from latent to acute, subacute, or chronic infections. Latent infections can become overt with stress. Acute infections are generally systemic. Chronic infections are the most common, and by the time they are diagnosed, they can be well established in a colony. Morbidity may approach 100%, and recovered animals may become carriers. Clinical signs are often nonspecific, and diarrhea is uncommon. In chronic disease, there are disseminated pyogranulomas. 28 Protozoa Eimeria caviae is identified as an infection of young animals. There is moderate morbidity and mortality. The large intestine and cecum are generally dilated, with dark green to brown fluid feces. In severe infections, the colonic wall is hyperemic, and the mucosa has petechial hemorrhages. Microscopically, there are many developmental stages causing necrosis in the epithelium. In clinically affected guinea pigs, diarrhea, dehydration, weight loss, and death may occur. E caviae has a typical eimerian life cycle. Sporulation takes 2 to 11 days, with an average under most conditions of 5 days, so frequent cleaning can prevent reinfection.",
