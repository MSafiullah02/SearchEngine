For example, based on substrate specificity, those cleaving O- or S-glycosides are grouped into EC 3.2.1 class, while hydrolases of N-glycosides belong to EC 3.2.2 class. Advancements in genomic science have also enabled classification into GH families based on their amino acid sequence similarities [7]. This system further groups GH families into clans, given the improved conservation of protein fold than the sequence [8]. Accordingly, the reviewed enzyme, \u03b2-glucuronidase (EC 3.2.1.31) is classified into GH family 1, 2, 30, 79, 154 and GH-A clan. \u03b2-glucuronidase (\u03b2GLU) is mainly a lysosomal hydrolase widely distributed in mammalian tissues, body fluids and microbiota; but significantly retained in the endoplasmic reticulum [9]. The enzyme is also found in plants, fishes, insects and molluscs.",

It is a 332 kDa ellipsoidal and homotetrameric glycoprotein with each 75\u201378 kDa monomer containing 651 amino acid residues (Fig. 1\na). The monomer precursor is synthesized initially on membrane-bound ribosomes and suffers C-terminal proteolytic processing of 18 amino acid propeptide en route or after their transport to the lysosomes [[10], [11], [12], [13]]. X-ray crystallography of the protein structure reveals a dihedral symmetry for the tetramer with two identical monomers in the asymmetric unit arising from disulphide-linked dimers. Each monomer contains three structural domains (Fig. 1b). The first domain has a barrel-like structure with a jelly roll motif; the second domain exhibits a geometry identical to immunoglobulin constant domains; while the third C-terminal domain forms a TIM barrel motif (\u03b2/\u03b1)8 [14]. The active sites of human \u03b2GLU (Fig. 1c) viz. catalytic acid Glu451 (proton donor), catalytic nucleophile Glu540 (carbonium ion stabilizer), Asp207 (plausible role as Glu540) and Tyr504 (unclear catalytic role), are all housed in the third domain and in each of the four catalytic centres of the tetramer [14,15]. Moreover, the enzyme has an optimal activity at acidic pH \u223c4.5, corresponding to its lysosomal environment and thermally stable up to 70 \u00b0C [10]; although hyperthermophilic variants exists in other media [16]. \u03b2GLU is encoded by the GUS gene. A deficiency arising from mutations in this encoding gene is associated with atherosclerosis [17] and lysosomal storage disease \u2013 Sly syndrome or mucopolysaccharidosis type VII [18].",

In normal body systems, drugs and other xenobiotics are detoxified via glucuronidation, an SN2 conjugation reaction and important pathway in phase II metabolism, catalysed by UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs). The resulting usually less active glucuronide metabolite is readily excreted by renal clearance due to increased polarity or sometimes via biliary clearance [34]. However, elevated levels of \u03b2GLU activity reverts this process through deglucuronidation, which hydrolyses the phase II metabolites to their active forms (Fig. 2). Hence, glycosidation of a drug to give its glucuronide enhances selective release of the active form at necrotic sites via \u03b2GLU-mediated deglucuronidation thus improving the drug\u2019s therapeutic potential [35].",

However, the fate of these inhibitors rests on their inhibition constants (K\ni), since GHs are generally characterized by high rate enhancement (kcat/kuncat > 1017-fold). Also, accumulating evidence suggests the dependence of inhibitory potency on the ability to mimic the highly enzyme-stabilized transition state of an enzymatic reaction (K\ni \u2248 10\u221220 M) en route to catalytic product [21,52,53].",

Using logistic regression modelling and the presence of at least 1 or 4 sites with PD \u2265 5 mm as disease criterion, \u03b2GLU activity showed promising potentials as a tool for periodontal disease screening or assessment of therapeutic intervention. The study also observed smoking status to be insignificant on enzyme activity. However, in a similar study, only PD, CAL and lymphocyte count exhibited positive correlation with salivary enzyme activity while no significant relationship was observed for Gg-I [70]. Recently, subjects with chronic generalized periodontitis were also found to have significant increase in \u03b2GLU activity (8-fold) compared to normal ones.

Treatment involved seven consecutive days of antibiotic administration with concurrent scaling, root planning and surgical therapy and a total of 36 months posttreatment evaluation period. Subsequently, a markedly downregulated neutrophil activity with approximately 50% inhibition of \u03b2GLU activity in GCF was observed. Periodontal health was also restored and maintained during posttreatment evaluations. In another study, \u03b2GLU activity was posited as a better biomarker compared to alkaline phosphatase for evaluating the response to non-surgical periodontal therapy in patients with different stages of periodontal disease [73]. Taken together, these results articulate the potentials of \u03b2GLU activity as an indication of PD, tissue inflammation or destruction as well as a biomarker of neutrophil influx, disease risk, susceptibility, status, or severity for timely diagnosis of the inflammatory disorder. However, administration of doxycycline hyclate in 16 subjects with aggressive periodontitis was inefficient on salivary \u03b2GLU activity [74]. Surprisingly, an increase in enzyme activity was found even after 2 months of treatment in 12 patients and a decrease in 4. Although, the authors concluded \u03b2GLU concentration only facilitated the detection of periodontal inflammation and not worthy as biomarker of susceptibility, their contrasting result is linkable to periodontal pre-treatment of subjects prior to examination and short treatment time using doxycycline.",

Based on cell maturity and clinical grading, enzyme activity was highest in subjects with low or moderately differentiated cells and in subjects with tumours infiltrating surrounding tissues and organs or visceral peritoneum respectively. Estimation of serum \u03b2GLU activity in this case proved to be 80% sensitive and 82% specific in distinguishing diseased and healthy subjects. Likewise, enzyme activity was elevated by 6-fold in the peritoneal fluids of patients with ovarian or endometrial cancer compared to women with infertility used as controls [97]. The stronger correlation between cancer stage and \u03b2GLU activity, compared to the correlations of other lysosomal exoglycosidases i.e. \u03b2-galactosidase and \u03b1-mannosidase, reiterated the improved clinical viability of \u03b2GLU activity as biomarker of gynaecologic tumour status and severity. However, \u03b2GLU activity was equally elevated in the peritoneal fluid of patients with pelvic inflammation hence compromising its application for differential diagnosis of gynaecologic cancer and pelvic inflammatory disease.",

Moreover, the reduced susceptibility of \u03b2GLU-egasyn complex to OP in humans is another primal factor [115]. In contrast to murine \u03b2GLU-egasyn interaction, binding in humans is independent of the C-terminal 18 amino acids propeptide in \u03b2GLU and esterase active site of egasyn.

Despite the poor stability at physiological pH, d-saccharic acid-1,4-lactone (d-SAL) has been explored extensively for its therapeutic significance. Although an IC50 value of 3.6 \u03bcM was reported in the pioneering work [117], a value ca. 40 \u03bcM is recurrent in literature. Nevertheless, at a concentration of 1 mM, d-SAL completely inhibited the hydrolytic action of human liver-derived \u03b2GLU on quercetin glucuronides [119], while over 90% inhibition of \u03b2GLU in breast milk was recorded at 10 \u03bcM [120]. Also, using urine samples of male Sprague-Dawley rats, d-SAL was identified via metabolomics strategy as one of the therapeutic constituents in LiuWeiDiHuang pills, a famous traditional Chinese prescription for cancer treatment and prevention [121]. Whereas, in a 6-days cumulative study, intraperitoneal pre or cotreatment of female Wistar rats with 3 mg/ml, 10 mg/ml or 10 mg/0.5 ml d-SAL reduced the severity of CPT-11 induced small-intestine mucosal damage assessed by the number of apoptotic cells or mitotic figures, compared to CPT-11 treated controls [122].

Diet supplementation with 0.5 or 2% d-SDL for 5 weeks significantly reduced aberrant crypt foci formation (i.e. pre-neoplastic lesions) by over 48.6 and 55.3% respectively, compared to azoxymethane-controls. d-GL did not afford any significant reduction in colonic tumour incidence during this initiation phase. In addition, 32 weeks treatment with d-SDL or high dose (2%) of d-GL, after 3-weeks subcutaneous injections of 15 mg/kg azoxymethane, provided over 70% inhibition of colon carcinogenesis during the post-initiation phase. It was suggested that d-SDL is a blocking agent which may inhibit pre-neoplasia during the initiation phase, while d-GL is only active during post-initiation of colon carcinogenesis. The increased hydrolytic stability of d-SDL to d-SAL in vivo might also be responsible for these observed phenomena [124].",

This intrinsic property encourages their utility as a major constituent of different local medicinal formulations and diets, while their acceptable toxicity profile and physiologic tolerance further presents them as druggable subjects. Flavonoids are typified by the C6\u2013C3\u2013C6 ring system that is, their basic structural skeleton consists of two benzene rings (A and B) linked by heterocyclic pyran ring C (Fig. 4\n). Variations on the chromane core (ring A and C) and attachment position of ring B due to biosynthetic origins lead to classification into flavones, flavanols, flavanones, flavonols, isoflavones, neoflavonoids, anthocyanins and chalcones [129]. This ring system and the presence of hydroxyl units has availed flavonoids with different pharmacological properties such as antidiabetic, antioxidant, antimicrobial, antiplasmodial, antiproliferative and particularly enzyme inhibition [130,131].",

Accordingly, naturally occurring androstane steroid hormone, 5-dehydroepiandrosterone (47, Fig. 8) and its Macrophomina phaseolina metabolites were examined for their \u03b2GLU inhibitory potentials [155]. The inferior potency/inactivity of metabolites compared to parent 5-dehydroepiandrosterone (IC50 = 77.9 \u03bcM) suggests that having an alkene unit at position-5 and cyclopentanone unit in the molecular architecture is crucial to inhibitory potency. Conversely, the synthetic anabolic steroid, dianabol and its metabolites by filamentous fungus Cunninghamella elegans or Macrophomina phaseolina were inactive against \u03b2GLU; except metabolite (48) with IC50 = 60.7 \u03bcM [156]. The E-oxime derivative (49) of an inactive metabolite however showed decent inhibitory potency with IC50 = 49.0 \u03bcM, equipotent with d-SAL and 2-fold superior than its Z-isomer. Nonetheless, the therapeutic safety of these dianabol derived \u03b2GLU inhibitors is questionable considering the increased risk of hepatotoxicity associated with oral administration of 17\u03b1-alkylated anabolic steroids [157,158].",

When anaerobically cocultured with E. coli (HGU-3), L. acidophilus CSG also potently inhibited \u03b2GLU productivity of E. coli compared to other LABs. As a result, oral treatment of the murine models with 500 mg/kg of L. acidophilus CSG alleviated CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity by lowering AST and ALT levels to 66% and 57% respectively, of CCl4 control group. Whereas, for t-BHP-induced hepatotoxicity, AST and ALT levels were lowered to 62% and 48% respectively, better than reference hepatoprotective agent DDB. Similarly, Lactobacillus plantarum CFR 2194 was the most effective strain of Lactobacilli metabolizing fructooligosaccharide prebiotics to short chain fatty acids, thereby altering \u03b2GLU productivity of E. coli [164]. Lactic acid (50, Fig. 9\n) and especially n-butyric acid (51) were identified as the major short chain fatty acid metabolites in the culture filtrate of Lactobacillus plantarum CFR 2194 and fructooligosaccharides responsible for the observed decrease in \u03b2GLU activity.",

Rats pre and cotreated with thymol by intragastric gavage at 7.5 mg/kg body weight/day for 7 days and subcutaneous injection of 100 mg/kg isoproterenol for 2 days (day 6 and 7), showed significantly reduced levels of cardiac troponin-T (a cardiotoxicity biomarker) and high-sensitive C-reactive protein in their sera, compared to those treated with isoproterenol only. Most importantly, the activities of lysosomal enzymes i.e. \u03b2GLU, \u03b2-galactosidase, cathepsin B and D in serum and heart were also potently inhibited to near-normal.

This class also include isoiminosugars (i.e. 1-azacarbasugars or 1-N-iminosugars) having a methylene unit in place of endocyclic oxygen and the anomeric carbon replaced with nitrogen. Although these ring alterations render iminosugars metabolically inert, their protonated forms mimic the pyranosyl or furanosyl unit in GH substrates, especially the putative oxocarbenium ion-like transition state (2, Fig. 2) in GH catalysed hydrolysis [21,169]. This in turn facilitates their recognizability by GHs and other carbohydrate-recognizing proteins for corresponding enzyme inhibition. Since the isolation of nojirimycin (55, first iminosugar) and siastatin B (56, first isoiminosugar) from Streptomyces cultures in 1966 and 1974 respectively [170,171], these sugar mimics have been a recurring subject of intensive research owing to their extensive biological activities and therapeutic applications elicited majorly through potent inhibition of GHs [172]. The strongest iminosugar-based inhibitors of bovine liver-derived \u03b2GLU reported so far (Fig. 10b), with promising antitumor potentials are siastatin B derivatives 57, 58 and 59 with IC50 = 65, 62 and 68 nM respectively [173]. Therefore, this section reviews iminosugars and their analogues as natural product-inspired \u03b2GLU inhibitors, without undue repetitions of other monographs [4,21,168,169] covering them.",

Evidenced by the most potent inhibitor 60 (Fig. 11\n) with K\ni = 12 nM, gluco-configured units, are stronger \u03b2GLU inhibitors compared to galacto- and manno-analogues, due to their better mimicry of glucuronic acid (4).

Further, although sugar configuration at C-4 was found to be ineffective on \u03b2GLU inhibition for glycaro-1,5-lactams 61 and 62, it was very significant for tetrazole and imidazole derivatives. Gluco-tetrazole (63) was 300-fold better than galacto-tetrazole (64), while gluco-imidazole (60) was 600-fold more potent than galacto-imidazole (65) and 1200 superior to manno-imidazopyridine (66), which differs at C-2. Moreover, sugar configuration of acid moiety at C-5 also had significant influence on potency. l-configured units 67, 68 and 69 were 20-50-fold weaker than their d-isomers 63, 62 and 61 respectively. More importantly, the 2-fold increased potency of gluco-imidazole (60) compared to gluco-tetrazole (63) was attributed to stronger interaction of gluco-imidazole (60) with catalytic nucleophile Glu540 compared to gluco-tetrazole (63).

Surprisingly, carbasugar 75 shared a similar fate with IC50 = 170 \u03bcM against E. coli \u03b2GLU, even though it is not an iminosugar [178]. Taken together, these results partly suggest that ability to mimic d-glucuronic acid favours \u03b2GLU inhibitory activity.",

Sugar configuration at C-1 and C-2 (Fig. 14d), significantly influenced selectivity for GHs. Hence, (2R, 3R)-configured molecules were selective inhibitors of E. coli \u03b2GLU but inactive against bovine liver \u03b2GLU, \u03b1-N-acetylgalactosaminidase and \u03b2-N-acetylgalactosaminidase. Whereas, (2S, 3S)-configuration infused selectivity for \u03b2-N-acetylgalactosaminidase. Consequently, (2R, 3R)-configured compound 92 with a rigid benzyl substituent emerged as the best E. coli \u03b2GLU inhibitor in the series with IC50 = 90.7 \u03bcM compared to 37.2% inhibition at 1 mM of compound 93 with (2S, 3S)-configuration and butyl unit. The authors attributed these inferior activities to stereochemical mismatch between the l-configured units and d-configured substrates of GHs. We also conceive that the presence of hydroxymethyl and not carboxylic unit (to mimic glucuronic acid) might also be responsible for the weak inhibitory potencies. This was indeed the case for 3,4,5-trihydroxypipecolic acids, uronic analogues of 1-deoxynojirimycin [185]. d-isomers were stronger than corresponding l-isomers, while the most active \u03b2GLU inhibitors were those with better mimicry of glucuronic acid viz. d-\ngluco and d-\ngalacto configured units; compounds 94 and 95 respectively (Fig. 15\n).

Specifically, the hydrazine unit in compound 104 formed H-b with Arg600, arene-arene interaction with Tyr508 via its thiazole ring and arene-cation contact with Arg600 via the pyrene unit. ortho-OH unit in compound 105 also formed H-b interaction with Asp207, while both thiazole nitrogen and ortho-OH interacted with Arg600. These interactions were also observed in compounds 106 and 107 but absent in other molecules with inferior potencies.",

It was also non-cytotoxic in CCK-8 assay in contrast to 2-fold increased cytotoxicity of equally potent 3-CF3 analogue. Notably, activity modulation by substituting trimethoxy unit for indole was unsuccessful [219], leading to prominent reduction in percentage inhibitory activity of the chalcones (\u02c3 8-fold).",

Pre-treating C57BL/6J mice with 10 \u03bcg of inhibitor 151 before intraperitoneal administration of ulcerogenic dose of NSAIDs \u2013 diclofenac (60 mg/kg), indomethacin (10 mg/kg) and ketoprofen (100 mg/kg), also successfully protected the mice models against NSAID-induced small intestine mucosal damage [224,225]. Moreover, compound 151 reduced all enteropathy parameters by inhibiting GI bacterial \u03b2GLU-mediated hydrolysis of NSAID-acyl glucuronide in a concentration-dependent manner (IC50 \u2248 0.164 \u03bcM). Interestingly, the compound did not alter drug\u2019s systemic exposure, hepatobiliary excretion of glucuronides and GI microbiota diversity. Although it possesses a short half-life (\u02c21 h) and pan-cytochrome P450-mediated poor bioavailability (21%). However, an attempt to reduce the inhibitor\u2019s serum exposure for increased GI residence by replacing ethoxy unit with hydroxyl or morpholinyl groups led to inferior pharmacological profile compared to parent compound 151 [226]. Further, compound 152 exerted 2-fold reduction in the severity of diclofenac-induced anastomotic leakage, without affecting drug\u2019s plasma concentration in Wistar rats receiving 0.8 \u03bcg of the inhibitor and 3 mg/kg of diclofenac [227]. In contrast, rats receiving diclofenac only suffered severe leakage thus suggesting the inhibitor\u2019s potential clinical utility to improve anastomotic healing.",

Whereas, MeO, Br, benzyloxy, furanyl, aliphatic alkyl or aryl units either reduced potency when co-substituted with polar F or OH groups, gave inferior activity with monosubstitution or rendered the molecule totally inactive. Therefore, the most active compound 159 with IC50 = 9.38 \u03bcM, found favourable fit in the active site of \u03b2GLU to form strong H-b interactions with key residues. NH of Asp207 was both a H-b donor and acceptor to pyrimidinone carbonyl oxygen and free NH at position-1 respectively. Carboxylate carbonyl oxygen interacted similarly with Arg600 whereas position-3 NH interacted with catalytic residues Glu451 and Tyr508. However, pyrimidinetriones (barbituric acid) [236,237], exhibited inferior potencies compared to standard d-SAL (IC50 = 45.75 \u03bcM), despite their similar binding interactions as compound 159 with active site residues and non-cytotoxicity to 3T3 cells.",

Interestingly, all the resulting derivatives showed good selectivity for E. coli \u03b2GLU except 2-Cl, 3-OH, 3-Me and 4-NH2 substituted derivatives. The trend in inhibitory potency, based on substituent\u2019s position varied in the order; meta < ortho < para, while the presence of strongly hydrophilic OH, NO2 and NH2 units at para-position was detrimental to potency. Consequently, 4-CF3, 4-Cl, 4-F, 4-COMe and 4-Me substituted derivatives with IC50 = 98, 35, 140, 130 and 37 nM respectively, exhibited the highest selectivity and % inhibition of E. coli \u03b2GLU. Although installing F, Cl, Br or Me substituents on quinoline pharmacophore increased potency for 4-Cl and 4-Me compounds, cytotoxicity at 100 \u03bcM to E. coli cells thwarted their therapeutic utility as well as other potent inhibitors (4-CF3, 4-Cl and 4-COMe) in the study. Only 4-F and 4-Me substituted compounds 167 and 168 respectively, remained non-lethal to E. coli cells. In addition, compound 167 showed greater inhibition of intestinal \u03b2GLU (75%) following oral administration to BALB/cJ mice for 5 consecutive days compared to compound 168 (40%). Whereas, pharmacokinetic profiling of compound 168 revealed its lower plasma concentration and increased GI residence for improved intestinal \u03b2GLU inhibition compared to azacoumarin compound 151. Most importantly, oral co-administration of compounds 167 or 168 at 3 mg kg\u22121 day\u22121 for 10 consecutive days with 50 mg kg\u22121 day\u22121 intraperitoneal injection of CPT-11, protected BALB/cJ mice models against CPT-11 drug-induced intestinal mucosal injury, without altering drug\u2019s therapeutic efficacy. Furthermore, mechanistic studies established that the presence of electronegative and electroneutral surface charges on E. coli active site pocket and the protonation of N-1 and N-5 atoms avails a pH-dependent and selective inhibition for the compounds (Fig. 52). Consequently, compounds 167 and 168 are clinically viable agents for protecting against GI E. coli \u03b2GLU-mediated mucosal damage and preventing the release of chemical carcinogens crucial to the development of precancerous lesions for colon carcinogenesis.",

Compound 177 (Fig. 57\n), emerged as the only inhibitor with promising activity with IC50 value of 3.38 \u03bcM. However, thiourea analogues bearing meta-Cl substituent on N-phenyl ring [248], were stronger inhibitors compared to those with unsubstituted N-phenyl ring or NO2 substituted ureas (Fig. 58\n). Akin to compound 141, thioureas containing piperazine unit also exhibited improved potency compared to their morpholine and piperidine analogues, while N-alkylation of piperazine with N-(o or p-methoxyphenyl) or N-(2-pyridyl), abolished potency. Compounds 178 (IC50 = 0.86 \u03bcM) and 179 (IC50 = 1.24 \u03bcM) were the most potent inhibitors overall.

Therefore, metal complexes with coordinatable metal centres exhibit significant bacterial \u03b2GLU inhibitory activities. To this end, Pd(II) complexes containing aniline and triphenylphosphine ligands were synthesized [250]. Para-chloroaniline derived metal complex 182 (Fig. 59\n), displayed the strongest activity against bacterial \u03b2GLU with 98.5% inhibition and IC50 = 15.40 \u03bcM. It was also 2- and 5-fold superior to meta-chloroaniline derived and N-methyl substituted metal complexes respectively. Similarly, N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes of Au(I) [251], as well as bis (NHC) complexes of Au(I) and Au(III) [252], containing hydroxy, chloride, acetoxy and acetonyl ligands were equally potent bacterial \u03b2GLU inhibitors with IC50 ranging from 0.14 to 2.60 \u03bcM. The strongest Au(I) NHC complex 183 (IC50 = 0.14 \u03bcM) was 327-fold more potent than reference d-SAL and 7-fold superior to strongest bis (NHC) complexes 184. Nonetheless, undesirable cytotoxicity against 3T3 cells discomfits the therapeutic significance of these metal complexes.",

            "text": "\u03b2GLU is a physiologically important lysosomal glycosyl hydrolase with appreciable therapeutic potentials such as biomarker for disease diagnosis, endogenous bioactivator in prodrug monotherapy and enzyme replacement therapy. The enzyme\u2019s role in cell proliferation and inflammation also renders it a potential target for anticancer and anti-inflammatory drugs development respectively. Moreover, since a significant number of commercially available drugs are metabolised by glucuronidation, hydrolytic activity (i.e. deglucuronidation) by \u03b2GLU in human intestinal microbiota has been linked to colon carcinogenesis and genotoxicity as well as drug-induced dose-limiting toxicities of anticancer agents and NSAIDs, which thwarts their therapeutic potential and clinical utility. Therefore, potent inhibition of \u03b2GLU holds enormous clinical importance.",

            "text": "Generally, our literature survey found that a significant number of natural products-derived inhibitors display moderate inhibition of \u03b2GLU, and increased potency is found with inhibitors containing a flavonoid skeleton. The physiological tolerance, acceptable toxicity and favourable pharmacodynamic profiles of these natural inhibitors, posits them as worthy scaffolds warranting witty molecular developments. In addition, iminosugars distinguish themselves as a unique class of natural product-inspired molecules with promising potentials regardless of their usually multiple synthetic steps. Notable amongst these are the nojirimycin analogues and iminosugar C-glycosides, both conferred with highly selective inhibition of bacterial \u03b2GLU. However, the inhibitory potency of these carbohydrate mimics relies on several factors such as sugar configuration, mimicry of glucuronic acid substrate and correct lipophilic balance. Hence, to harness their remarkable potential, ingenious manipulations of the synthetic medicinal chemist interested in exploring their chemical space is expressly required.",

Based on the foregoing, a comprehensive list of potent synthetic inhibitors (IC50 \u2264 5 \u03bcM) in this review is provided in Table SI of supporting information. Evinced by their nanomolar IC50 values, quinoline-pyrazoles (167 and 168), piperazine-containing compounds (156 and 157; 192 and analogues) as well as the indole nucleus, are conferred with the strongest inhibition of \u03b2GLU activity overall. The order of potency for hydrazone tethers was found as; bisindole \u02c3 indole > quinoline > thiazole \u02c3 benzothiazole \u2248 oxadiazole. Whereas, NO2, Cl, particularly F and OH substituents at ortho- or para-positions usually produce stronger \u03b2GLU inhibitors compared to their meta-substitutions.",

Consequently, we envisage that the model \u03b2GLU inhibitor will be that which is appositely tuned in its lipophilicity and polarity for easy cell penetration, favourable fit into the binding/catalytic pocket of \u03b2GLU for energetically stable binding and strong enzyme inhibition. We also perceive that rationale molecular hybridization of those active class of natural products and synthetic molecules will furnish stronger inhibitors of \u03b2GLU with improved selectivity and acceptable toxicity profile.",

This was particularly true for piperazine based inhibitors. Therefore, we believe further probing of this phenomenon will allow structure-activity guided molecular tuning to afford stronger \u03b2GLU inhibitors.",
