Patients with a clinically defined VAP were randomly assigned to a treatment group receiving twice-daily tobramycin inhalation 300 mg and standard IV AB therapy for 8 days or to a control group which received twice-daily placebo inhalation and standard IV AB treatment for 8 days. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are described in the protocol as supplementary file. Primary outcome was treatment failure at day 4, defined as one of the following four criteria present at day 4: (1) no improvement of the PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio, (2) persistence of fever (\u2265 38 \u00b0C) or hypothermia (< 35.5 \u00b0C) together with purulent respiratory secretions, (3) increase in the pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiograph of \u2265 50%, and (4) occurrence of septic shock or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, defined as three or more organ system failures not present on day 1. Secondary outcomes were 30-day mortality and number of ventilation free days at day 28. The target sample size would be 84 patients, which provides an 80% power to detect a difference of 32% in cure rate between treatments.

Two recent prospective trials did not show a benefit of inhaled AB therapy as adjunctive treatment for VAP [3, 4] . The findings of our explorative double-blind randomized-controlled trial failed to show a beneficial effect of adjunctive tobramycin inhalation therapy in the treatment of VAP. However, due to the small number of patients, the current study was underpowered. The relative risk for therapy failure at day 4 in the study group compared to the control group is 0.5 (95% CI 0.19-1.3), meaning that therapy failure occurred twice as often in the control group. The next step is to investigate whether inhalation antibiotics could be beneficial in certain subgroups, such as an infection with *Correspondence: m.vandereerden@erasmusmc.nl 1 Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands Full author information is available at the end of the article MDR microorganisms, as has also been recommended in a recent review [5] .",
