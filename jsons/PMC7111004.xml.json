            "text": "Two ligands were selected for the docking studies. One was KZ7088 (Fig. 2A\n) and the other the octapeptide AVLQSGFR. As shown in Fig. 2A, KZ7088 is a derivative by modifying AG7088 (Fig. 2B). The latter was developed by Pfizer and is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of rhinovirus, a pathogen that can cause the common cold. Although it is a putative candidate for docking studies related to SARS drug finding, AG7088 has a p-fluorophenylalanine side chain (p-fluorobenzyl), which might be too long (or bulky) to fit into the relevant binding pocket [1]. Accordingly, KZ7088 with a modified side chain by removing -CH2 (Fig. 2) could well serve as a starting point for modification that will quickly lead to effective drug candidates for the treatment of SARS. The reason to select the octapeptide AVLQSGFR is as follows. (1) The protease-susceptible sites in proteins usually extend to an octapeptide, as generally formulated by P4P3P2P1P1\u2032P2\u2032P3\u2032P4\u2032 with the scissile bond located between the subsites P1 and P1\u2032, as generally expressed by P1\u2193P1\u2032\n[2], [3], [4]. (2) The SARS coronavirus enzyme and several viral proteinases exhibit Gln \u2193 (Ser, Ala, and Gly) specificity [1]. (3) According to the \u201clock-and-key\u201d mechanism in enzymology, the octapeptide cleavable by the SARS proteinase must have a good fit for binding to the active site. However, such a peptide, after a modification of its scissile bond with some simple routine procedure, will completely lose its cleavability but it can still bind to the active site. Actually, the molecule thus modified can be compared to a \u201cdistorted key\u201d that can be inserted into a lock but can neither open the lock nor be pulled out from it, spontaneously becoming an ideal competitive inhibitor against the SARS proteinase. Therefore, it would provide us with useful insights for drug design by studying the binding mechanism of SARS proteinase with octapeptides that are cleavable by the enzyme itself. For a detailed discussion about the rationale of \u201cdistorted key,\u201d see a review by Chou [5] and Fig. 2 therein.",

The constituents of the binding pocket are defined by those residues that have at least one heavy atom (i.e., other than hydrogen) with a distance \u2a7d5 \u00c5 from a heavy atom of KZ7088 (a similar binding pocket was defined for ATP in the Cdk5\u2013Nck5a*\u2013ATP complex [6] that has later proved quite useful in identifying functional domains and stimulating the relevant truncation experiments [9]). The pocket thus defined consists of 23 residues, as listed in Table 1\n. It would be intriguing to probe the binding pocket by site-directed mutagenesis of single amino acids as an avenue to find out which of the 23 residues is the most sensitive for the catalytic activity.

Those residues involved in forming the hydrogen bonds from the enzyme are: Arg-40, His-41, Phe-185, Asp-187, and Gln-189. The detailed atoms in forming the hydrogen bonds are given in Table 3\n, which may provide useful information for in-depth understanding of the mechanism of the nucleophilic attack of the active site on the carbonyl carbon atom of the scissile peptide bond [10]. It is interesting to see that, after a single amino acid mutation for the octapeptide at the position P1, i.e., substitution of Q by E, the interaction of hydrogen bonding between the enzyme and the mutated octapeptides AVLESGFR would be reduced to only three hydrogen bonds (Fig. 6B) from the original six (Fig. 6A).
