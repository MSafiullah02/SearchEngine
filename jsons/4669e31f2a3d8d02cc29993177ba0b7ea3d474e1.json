However, despite the diversity of novel theoretical approaches and the comprehensiveness of many widely established models, the official figures that recount the course of the outbreak still sketch a largely elusive and intimidating picture. Here we show unambiguously that the dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak belongs to the simple universality class of the SIR model and extensions thereof. Our analysis naturally leads us to establish that there exists a fundamental limitation to any theoretical approach, namely the unpredictable non-stationarity of the testing frames behind the reported figures. However, we show how such bias can be quantified self-consistently and employed to mine useful and accurate information arXiv:2005.11085v1 [q-bio.PE] 22 May 2020 from the data. In particular, we describe how the time evolution of the reporting rates controls the occurrence of the apparent epidemic peak, which typically follows the true one in countries that were not vigorous enough in their testing at the onset of the outbreak. The importance of testing early and resolutely appears as a natural corollary of our analysis, as countries that tested massively at the start clearly had their true peak earlier and less deaths overall.",

Nonetheless, as we show in the following, save few creditable exceptions, the reporting rate has generally increased substantially as the outbreak was gathering momentum, along with the stepping up of the number of tests conducted.

It appears remarkable that a process that is inherently complex and unpredictably manyfaceted can be accurately described in terms of an effective, highly simplified mean-field scheme, where many factors are deliberately omitted, such as space and different sorts of population stratification. Of course, the effectiveness of SIR schemes and simple modifications thereof are well-known. 19, 20 For example, a recent work shows that a modified SIR model where the infection rate is let vary with time can be employed to infer change points in the epidemic spread to gauge the effectiveness of specific confinement measures in Germany. 18 In an earlier work, two of the present authors had considered a similar approach to elaborate predictions of the outbreak in Italy that proved fundamentally right when compared with the evolution observed afterwards. 14 What Fig. 1 critically adds to the picture is a bias-free confirmation that simple mean-field schemes can be used meaningfully to draw quantitative conclusions.",

Most likely, these amount to different degrees of (time-dependent) reduction of the infection rate r, following the containment measures. Interestingly, we find that, rather generally, the evolution of such non-stationary SIRD dynamics falls into the same universality class in the plane (\u1e0a, D) as signified by f (D), Eq.

Conversely, the testing activity has been vigorous in Germany at the onset of the outbreak, but appears to have slowed down substantially as the epidemics progressed. As a consequence, the apparent peak has been reported while the epidemics was still growing. In both cases, our estimate is consistent with the fact that only 15 % of infected persons are effectively reported. China seems to provide an instance of the marginal case\u03b1 I = 0. Despite an early ramping up, the reporting fraction of infected appears to be remarkably stable, which is consistent with the co-occurence of the true and the apparent peaks.

Another interesting feature that emerges clearly from the comparison of \u03b1 I and \u03b1 R is the average recovery time, which can be inferred for example by direct inspection of the testing activity in Italy. The curve \u03b1 R (t) appears to be shifted in the future by about 10 days with respect to \u03b1 I (t), which is consistent with the present consensus estimate of an average time for recovery of two weeks. Figure 3 : The true epidemic peak occurs within 30 days after the first ten deaths, the earlier the higher the initial testing rate. When shifted so that they coincide at the day where ten new deaths were first reported, the\u1e0a time series reveal that the true epidemic peak occurs inevitably rather early in the outbreak, visibly not later than one month after the first ten casualties reported.

This is illustrated in Fig. 6 for a choice of f in the interval [0.1, 3]. The evolution of outbreaks generated from a given root one, that is, one with a given infection rate r(0) = r 0 , can always be described by the same one-parameter function \u03c6(x; R eff 0 ) with an effective reproduction number R eff 0 that only depends on f . Moreover, R eff 0 for f < 1 is simply the t = 0 value reduced by the same factor, that is",
