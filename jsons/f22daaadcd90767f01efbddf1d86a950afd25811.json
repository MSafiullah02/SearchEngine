[2] According to the Ministry of Health, over 20 thousand cases of COVID-19 were diagnosed in Brazil until April 12, 2020, but we lack data on Intensive Care Unit bed occupation. [3] What is known is that many Intensive Care Unit patients will require mechanical ventilation. Retrospective data on Intensive Care Unit patients admitted with COVID-19 in Italy have shown that 88% of 1,590 patients required mechanical ventilation. [4] The United States, and especially the state of New York, are the current epicenter of the pandemic. There, the deficit of mechanical ventilators is a major concern, and it can also be the case in Brazil. [5] In order to try to minimize the deficit of ventilators, many groups of researchers, linked to the industry or not, are trying to develop new ventilators at a lower cost in a short period of time. However, the development of such equipment may take time due to the technical complexity and also because scale production is required. It is also important to underscore that currently we are facing a worldwide electronic component shortage crisis, which adds an extra caveat.",

[6] By using an anesthesia machine as a mechanical ventilator, with a high fresh gas flow (FGF), the CO2 absorbent (soda lime) lasts longer and can be kept in the breathing circuit. However, one of the problems that can occur would be an extended period of ventilation, such as days or weeks, with low FGF use. The scenario would require the CO2 absorbent (soda lime) to be replaced several times a day.",

For the low compliance lung, parameters were: TV of 300 mL, RR of 40 cycles per minute, MV of 12 L.min -1 and PEEP of 10 cm H2O (Table 1) . We started to change the FGF of the anesthesia machine and registered the inspired fraction of CO2.

In Brazil, it will not be different and maybe even worse. According to the Brazilian Critical Care Association (Associa\u00e7\u00e3o de Medicina Intensiva Brasileira) census, there are roughly 42 thousand ICU beds in Brazil, albeit not all beds have mechanical ventilators.[1] Brazil has",
