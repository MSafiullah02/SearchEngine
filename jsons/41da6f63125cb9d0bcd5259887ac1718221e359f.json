In 27 New York City, the epicenter of the US outbreak, almost all hospital resources were directed 28 towards supporting surge beds for COVID patients. However, vascular surgery emergencies still 29 needed to be addressed. We describe a case of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) 30",

(Figure 3 ) The patient was enrolled 65 into our standard surveillance protocol, with repeat imaging at 6 months, 12 months, and then 66 yearly after that. At the time of this patient's presentation, our hospital had already set up 3 dedicated ORs for 94 COVID-19 positive patients, one of which was a hybrid room. These rooms were set up with 95 high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration units. COVID carts were also placed in front of 96 each OR with bundles of complete personal proactive equipment (PPE). These were given to 97 every staff member that was required to enter the OR. These bundles contained a bouffant cap, 98 an N95 mask, face shield, full body (\"bunny\") suit, knee-high shoe covers, and elbow-high latex 99 gloves. After PPE was donned, we \"scrubbed\" the gloves with Avagard (chlorhexidine 100 gluconate 1% / ethyl alcohol 61%), then put on sterile gown and gloves over everything. All 101 non-essential personnel were prohibited from entering the OR. We utilized two circulating 102 nurses, one inside the OR and one outside the OR to prevent repeated entering and exiting. Ruptured AAA in COVID-19 positive patients can be treated endovascularly with satisfactory 140 short-term results. This is important as it can often be performed without intubation, thereby 141 minimizing risk of exposure to the surgeon and OR staff. Hospital preparedness during a 142 pandemic is also vital to success in emergent operations. Long term effects of implanting an 143 endograft during an active COVID-19 infection is unknown and will need to be monitored. ",

Many vascular surgeons have been asked to step out of their usual roles to help out in 72 other ways, such staffing a \"line service\", or filling in as intensivists or hospitalist on COVID 73 units. In the early experience with COVID-19 patients, vascular complications predominantly 74 were thromboembolic in nature, both venous and arterial. [1-3] 75 76 Other vascular issues fell to the wayside, and elective vascular surgery was non-existent. 77 However, both COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative patients continued to have need for 78 emergent vascular surgery in the midst of the pandemic. The patient described here, was self-79 quarantining at home with suspected COVID-19 when he ruptured his AAA. We cannot assume 80 that one had to do with another, and we do not suggest there is a relationship between COVID-19 81 infection and aneurysmal disease. In this patient with relatively good potential for survival, not 82 offering intervention at this juncture was not an option. However, care of the patient with a 83 ruptured aneurysm during this crisis does require special consideration regarding the type of 84 surgery and anesthesia. [4] 85 86 His treatment still followed standard protocols for a ruptured aortic aneurysm. Regardless of 87 COVID-19 status, we employ an endovascular first approach for ruptured aneurysm, as 88 recommended by the 2018 Society of Vascular Surgery guidelines. [5] During this time when 89 there was a severe shortage of ventilators and intensive care beds, being able to avoid open 90surgery was paramount to prevent further reduction of already scarce resources. Fortunately, the 91 patient's anatomy was favorable for an endovascular repair. 92",

            "text": "103Recovery occurred in the OR, as the regular post-anesthesia care unit had already been converted 104 to a COVID intensive care unit. Post recovery, patients were transferred to dedicated COVID105 floors. 106 107 His concomitant fever and a viral pneumonia secondary to presumed, and later proven, COVID-108 19 infection raised additional concerns. Though it is primarily a respiratory infection, some 109 patients develop systemic involvement. [6] The effect of implanting an endograft in an active 110 COVID-19 infection is unknown. The potential increased risk of limb thrombosis was taken into 111 account as these patients are thought to be in a prothrombotic state. [1-3] Considering the risks 112 and benefits, and the available resources, we felt endovascular repair would still be preferable at 113 this time. After the procedure, we immediately resumed aspirin and clopidogrel which the 114 patient was already on. Fortunately our patient did not have any thrombotic events. At the time 115 of his presentation, we did not think full dose anticoagulation was necessary. However, as more and more arterial thrombotic complications are being reported, we feel a short course of 117 anticoagulation after aortic stent graft implantation with either a low molecular weight heparin or 118 novel oral anticoagulant would be justified until the COVID-19 infection is cleared. 119 120 Another consideration was the type of anesthesia for the repair. The patient's hemodynamics and 121 mental status gave us the option to perform the case under local anesthesia. Local anesthesia for 122 EVAR of a ruptured AAA correlates to shorter ICU stays, lower pulmonary complications, and 123 lower mortality compared to general anesthesia in a Vascular Quality Initiative database 124analysis.[7] Equally important, intubation has been shown to be a major aerosol producing 125 procedure, in turn a potential threat all personnel in the operating room.[8] Lastly, this would 126 avoid the chance of not being able to extubate after the procedure, thus tying up another 127 ventilator in the hospital. The main reason in favor of general anesthesia would be to avoid an 128 emergent intubation in the middle of the procedure. We had an extensive discussion with our 129 anesthesiologist prior to bring the patient into the OR, and for the reasons above, chose to use 130 local anesthesia for the case thus avoiding intubation and minimizing exposure to the staff. 131 132 Lastly, we asked our Infectious Disease colleagues for their recommendations on therapy 133 specifically for the COVID-19 infection. The patient was started on hydroxychloroquine and 134 azithromycin, which was the regimen given to all COVID-19 patients that were admitted to the 135 hospital at that time.",
