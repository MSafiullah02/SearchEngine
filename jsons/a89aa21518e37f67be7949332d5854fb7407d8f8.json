In some clinical situations, this will be too long, and clinical decisions must be made without test results for guidance.

Current algorithms for \u2022 seriously ill patients depend on empiric treatment based on the most likely pathogens for a given clinical presentation; however, this method involves broad-spectrum therapy to cover the likely contingencies. Knowing the exact identi fi cation of the pathogen will allow more focused therapeutic decisions. If a molecular method also detects important resistance factors in the pathogen, then a therapeutic decision can be made speci fi cally to both treat the pathogen and limit development of resistant organisms. POCT infectious disease molecular assays may be developed to detect speci fi c \u2022 infections for which a rapid response is desirable. Examples include common outpatient infections such as group A streptococcal pharyngitis where immediate diagnosis saves follow-up effort; or Chlamydia and gonorrhea, where rapid results may allow immediate treatment of patients who might otherwise be lost to follow-up.

Increasingly, healthcare institutions are being asked to become more cost-effective, and rapid applications of infection control activities have been shown to be most effective.

No molecular test has yet achieved CLIA \"waived\" status (although some are being developed for FDA submission), so POC molecular tests are still physician's of fi ce lab or \"satellite lab\" tests rather than true bedside methods. Several comparatively simple, rapid molecular methods, though, are available and increasingly used. The most widely used molecular test at patient POC sites is the real-time PCR (RT-PCR) assay for detection of nasal colonization of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) [ 2 ] . Colonized patients can be placed into contact isolation, decolonization protocols can be initiated, and appropriate surgical prophylaxis can be used [ 3 ] . The use of this assay within the United States Veterans' Administration hospitals is one factor credited with lowering healthcare-associated MRSA infections 59 % since universal screening and additional infection control interventions were implemented. Selected nosocomial infections due to Clostridium dif fi cile and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) also decreased [ 4 ] . Two further reports on the use of surveillance for MRSA illustrate the effectiveness of this intervention. With rapid results available within hours of patient admission, the Northshore Hospital System showed 69.6 % decrease in hospital-associated MRSA disease over the study period [ 5 ] . In contrast, another healthcare institution used a slower method for MRSA nasal surveillance with results available more than a day later and results were disappointing [ 6 ] . Molecular POC tools are virtually the only method possible to achieve the most effective infection control. Additional assays that detect both MRSA and methicillinsusceptible staphylococci in patients' skin and soft tissue wound sites and in nares are also available [ 7 ] .",

Current culture-based technology \u2022 requires incubation for at least 8 hours before the fi rst indication of a positive result, after which some organisms can be rapidly identi fi ed using molecular methods [ 26 ] . However, appropriate therapy within the fi rst few hours often makes the difference between severe morbidity or death and recovery [ 27 ] . Because the numbers of circulating bacteria or yeast in the bloodstream of septicemic patients can be low, the volume of blood necessary to detect small numbers of organisms has limited the application of molecular methods. Once an effective front-end concentration system is developed, the diagnosis of these extremely severe infections can be approached as a POC test. Meningitis and encephalitis are potentially severe infections that bene fi t from \u2022 early diagnosis so that patients can be appropriately managed. The limited number of common pathogens associated with CNS infections makes development of such tests feasible. Additional agents for which rapid, simple molecular tests are needed include Neisseria meningitidis , Streptococcus pneumoniae , GBS, Listeria , Haemophilus in fl uenzae , herpes simplex and varicella zoster virus. Tests for diagnosis and management of diseases seen in outpatients, particularly \u2022 those in hard-to-manage populations. POC tests for STDs, for respiratory viruses and group A streptococci, and for HIV and HCV viral load can potentially streamline care for these conditions, allowing same-visit management and decreasing both the effort of follow-up and the potential public health impact of patients who cannot be contacted to deliver their results. Many clinicians and infection preventionists are concerned about the rising \u2022 incidence of multidrug-resistant gram-negative rods. Metallo-beta-lactamases, carbapenemases, cephalosporinases, etc., pose risks to patients and problems for infection control. A rapid molecular test to detect major determinants of resistance, regardless of the organism carrying them, would be a desirable rapid or POC test.",
