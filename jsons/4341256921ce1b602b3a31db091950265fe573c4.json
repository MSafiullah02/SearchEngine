During spread from infected cells, vaccinia virus (VACV) particles induce localized actin nucleation that propel virus to surrounding cells and facilitate cell-to-cell spread of infection. Here we show that virus-tipped actin comets are composed of band g-actin. We employed isoform-specific siRNA knockdown to examine the role of the two isoforms in VACVinduced actin comets. Despite the high level of similarity between the actin isoforms, and their colocalization, VACV-induced actin nucleation was dependent exclusively on b-actin. Knockdown of b-actin led to a reduction in the release of virus from infected cells, a phenotype dependent on virus-induced Arp2/3 complex activity. We suggest that local concentrations of actin isoforms may regulate the activity of cellular actin nucleator complexes. K E Y W O R D S actin, transport, virus",

It is likely that actin-based motility contributes to virus spread via a variety of mechanisms. For example, the repulsion of superinfecting virions allows nonreplicative transmission across early stage-infected cells, thereby increasing the overall rate of cell-to-cell spread (Doceul, Hollinshead, van der Linden, & Smith, 2010) . It has also been observed that when VACV-induced actin nucleation is abrogated, WV remain trapped at the cell surface in pits (Horsington, Lynn, Turnbull, Cheng, Braet, Diefenbach, . . . Newsome, 2013) , indicating that actin nucleation provides a force necessary to resolve exocytosis of virus particles.",

Following fusion of this outer WV membrane with the plasma membrane, A36 becomes phosphorylated at Tyr112 and Tyr132 by the action of Srcand Abl-family tyrosine kinases (Frischknecht, Cudmore, Moreau, Reckmann, Rottger, & Way, 1999a; Newsome, Scaplehorn, & Way, 2004; Newsome, Weisswange, Frischknecht, & Way, 2006; Reeves, Bommarius, Lebeis, McNulty, Christensen, Swimm, . . . Kalman, 2005) . Phosphorylation of A36 leads to the recruitment of a host of cellular proteins, the core cascade comprising of Nck, WIP/WIRE and N-WASP, which act to stabilize and activate the Arp2/3 complex at the cytoplasmic surface of EV (Moreau et al., 2000; Snapper, Takeshima, Anton, Liu, Thomas, Nguyen, . . . Alt, 2001) . Optimal virus-induced actin nucleation also utilizes other host factors such as Grb2, FHOD1, casein kinase 2, clathrin, the clathrin adaptor AP2, and is accompanied by activation of the small Rho GTPases Cdc42 and Rac1 (Alvarez and Agaisse, 2013; Alvarez and Agaisse, 2014; Humphries, Dodding, Barry, Collinson, Durkin, & Way, 2012; Scaplehorn, Holmstrom, Moreau, Frischknecht, Reckmann, & Way, 2002) . The critical signal output that results from A36 tyrosine phosphorylation is actin nucleation, and drug inhibition of actin dynamics during viral infection phenocopies, to a large extent, the effects of genetic ablation of A36 or substitution of the Tyr112 and Tyr132 to phenylalanines (VACV-A36 YdF ) (Horsington et al., 2013) .",

Despite their surprisingly similar sequence homologies [only differing by four amino acids; (Vandekerckhove and Weber, 1978a) ], recent reports have revealed that band g-CYA have different functions and display distinct subcellular localization patterns (Artman, Dormoy-Raclet, von Roretz, & Gallouzi, 2014; Dugina, Zwaenepoel, Gabbiani, Clement, & Chaponnier, 2009; Joseph, Srivastava, & Pfister, 2014; Pasquier, Tuset, Sinnappan, Carnell, Macmillan, & Kavallaris, 2015) . b-actin is predominantly found in basal areas of the cell, cell-cell contacts and stress fibres, while g-CYA is more apically abundant, and concentrated at peripheral structures such as lamellipodia and the leading edge of motile cells (Chaponnier and Gabbiani, 2004; Dugina et al., 2009] . Differential localization may contribute to the functional diversity of these isoforms, as g-CYA has been shown to be specifically required for directional cell migration, while b-CYA contributes to cell attachment and microparticle formation (Latham, Chaponnier, Dugina, Couraud, Grau, & Combes, 2013) . The aim of this study was to determine if there are isoform-specific functions of band g-CYA during the well-characterized phenomenon of VACV-induced actin nucleation.",

Actin comets generated by a subpopulation of egressing virus particles are evident below the cell surface of VACV infected cells at 7-9 hr postinfection (hpi; Cudmore et al., 1995; Smith and Law, 2004) . Immunofluorescence assays (IFA) of siRNA-treated cells stained with anti-b-CYA and anti-g-CYA specific antibodies revealed the localization of both CYA isoforms in the cytoskeleton ( Figure 1a ) and VACV-induced actin comets in endothelial hCMEC/D3 cells ( Figure   1b ). VACV-induced actin comets are readily imaged at the level of the substrate due to the low z-axis profile of adherent cells. b-CYA preferentially localizes to the basal region, while g-CYA preferentially localizes to apical regions of HSCF cells (Dugina et al., 2009) . We therefore examined z-sections of infected cells to determine if the preference of actin isoforms along the apical-basal axis was reflected in their localization to actin comets on the apical or basal membrane. A z-stack of images of infected cells (Figure 1c ) with VACV-induced actin comets ( Figure 1d ) was taken via confocal microscopy. These data led us to conclude that VACV-associated actin comets are composed of both CYA isoforms irrespective of their basal or apical localization.",

To this end, we established knockdown of b-CYA and g-CYA in HeLa, GBM MARZOOK ET AL. | 171 (glioblastoma) and hCMEC/D3 cell lines. Treatment of HeLa, GBM and hCMEC/D3 cells resulted in isoform-specific knockdown when compared to the scrambled siRNA condition (Figure 2a ). Densitometry analysis showed that b-CYA knockdown caused a significant reduction of b-CYA to about 31, 8, and 44% compared with levels in the scrambled siRNA control in HeLa, GBM, and hCMEC/D3 cells, respectively (p < .05, n 2; Figure 2b ). g-CYA siRNA treatment produced a comparatively less efficient knockdown of g-CYA to about 52, 35, and 55% in HeLa, GBM, and hCMEC/D3 cells, respectively (p < .05, n 2; Figure 2b ). Interestingly, knockdown of b-CYA led to a corresponding significant increase in g-CYA in HeLa and GBM cell types. This suggests that under knockdown conditions, cells overexpress one isoform to compensate for loss of the other. This has not been observed for CYA isoforms in other studies, either using the same cocktail of isoform-specific siRNA (Dugina et al., 2009) or using only one of those sequences (Pasquier et al., 2015) . This could be due to their use of different cell types, varying doses of siRNA or incubation times, and/or the use of only a single CYA-specific siRNA in one of the studies. The use of a pan-actin antibody which detects both cytoplasmic isoforms revealed that there is a compensatory effect of actin isoform expression during either b-CYA or g-CYA knockdown in HeLa cells, as there is no significant difference in total actin levels under either knockdown condition (Supporting Information Fig. S1 ). This is supported by observations from other studies where neither isoform knockdown significantly affected the total level of actin in HSCF cells (Dugina et al., 2009 ) and A549 human lung epithelial cells (Lechuga, Baranwal, Li, Naydenov, Kuemmerle, Dugina, . . . Ivanov, 2014) . GBM cells, however, show significantly reduced levels of total actin expression during g-CYA knockdown (Supporting Information Fig. S1 ).",

            "text": "Since both CYAs were reported to not only have different localizations, but also different functions within a cell (Dugina et al., 2009) , the next step was to determine if there was a distinct role for either CYA in VACV-induced actin comets. hCMEC/D3 cells were treated with bor g-CYA-specific siRNA for 72 hr before being infected with VACV-WR and fixed 8 hpi. IFA of siRNA-treated cells stained with anti-b-CYA and anti-g-CYA specific antibodies (Dugina et al., 2009) significantly reduced in the presence of their respective siRNA, as shown by IFA (Figure 3a ). While bor g-CYA-specific siRNA have previously been shown to cause incomplete knockdown of their respective targets, it was still sufficient to cause significant changes to cell morphology and behavior (Dugina et al., 2009) . As with the control cells from Figure 1 , both b-CYA and g-CYA were detected in virusassociated actin comets in the scrambled siRNA-treated cells ( Figure   1b ). In g-CYA knockdown cells, g-CYA was greatly reduced and b-CYA was concentrated at VACV-induced actin tails (Figure 3b Figure 4c) . Surprisingly, knockdown of g-CYA elicited a two-fold increase in virus motility (0.17 lm/s compared with 0.8 lm/s). In summary, we observed that actin comets produced under b-CYA knockdown are shorter although their speeds remain the same relative to the controls. There was no significant difference in length of actin comets produced by g-CYA knockdown and scrambled siRNA-treated HeLa cells. This implies that while b-CYA is necessary for the initiation of VACV comets, the ratio of b-CYA to g-CYA in a cell may determine the speed of VACV motility, whereby the presence of g-CYA in the actin comet has a moderating effect on virus speed.",

            "text": "The mutant virus is therefore unable to induce actin comets (Rietdorf et al., 2001 ) and a subsequent reduction in release of extracellular enveloped virus (EEV) from the cell is observed (Horsington et al., 2013) . Supernatants from infected cells were collected and plaque assays were performed to determine the infectious EEV titre of each condition ( Figure 5a ). In cells infected by VACV-WR, EEV release into the supernatant (measured in plaque forming units or pfu/mL) was significantly reduced under b-CYA knockdown. These results are consistent with our previous observations that disrupting actin-based motility leads to a corresponding reduction in EEV release. Cells infected by VACV-A36 YdF showed greatly reduced EEV release when compared with VACV-WR as has been previously reported (Horsington et al., 2013) . However, no difference in EEV release of VACV-A36 YdF was observed under either CYA knockdown condition. All phenotypes associated with actin-based motility are ablated in VACV-A36 YdF , and b-CYA knockdown does not exacerbate defects in EEV release in a VACV-A36 YdF . This suggests that b-CYA also disrupts EEV release through actin-based motility rather than other WV protein interactions known to affect EEV release (Smith, Vanderplasschen, & Law, 2002) . | 175 (Horsington et al., 2013; Rodger and Smith, 2002; Zhang, Wilcock, & Smith, 2000] , we aimed to test how b-CYA knockdown in cells might affect VACV plaque size or morphology. GBM cells (selected over HeLa due to their amenability to forming monolayers) were subjected to either CYA knockdown and allowed to near confluence, at which point a plaque assay was conducted with VACV-WR. Three days post infection, plaque assays were fixed and the diameter of plaques was measured (Figure 5e ). Confounding expectations, plaques produced by VACV-WR treated with b-CYA knockdown were significantly larger than those compared to plaques produced in cells under g-CYA knockdown or treated with scrambled siRNA. These results indicate that knockdown of b-CYA produces a complex phenotype and that other mechanisms may compensate for the expected reduction in plaque size elicited by the reduction in actin-based motility.",

(a) hCMEC/D3 cells were treated with the respective siRNA for 72 hr, followed by VACV-WR infection at an MOI > 5. Cells were fixed 8 hpi and stained for F-actin and the number of actin tails per cell was enumerated ('***': p < .001; n 5 40 cells for each treatment, with 3 replicate experiments performed). (b) hCMEC/D3 (D1) and HeLa (D2) cell lines were treated with the siRNA as indicated for 72 hr and infected with VACV-WR at an MOI > 3. Cells were fixed 8 hpi, followed by staining for F-actin and viral envelope proteins. Actin tail lengths were measured using ImageJ image-analysing software and graphs created using GraphPad PRISM, with nonparametric t-tests used to determine significance in differences between parameters (n 5 60 tails each). (c) Speeds of VACV actin comets were calculated using FIJI (ver. 2.0.0) image-analyzing software from live-cell imaging experiments and statistical analyses were carried out using GraphPad PRISM (ver. 6 for Mac OSX), with one-way ANOVA and Tukey's multiple comparison tests. \"ns\": p > .05, \"*\": p .05, \"***\": p .001, \"****\": p .0001. the mechanism. N-WASP is an actin nucleation-promoting factor that is recruited to the site of actin comet formation during VACV egress (Frischknecht et al., 1999b; Moreau et al., 2000) . The VCA domain of N-WASP recruits the Arp2/3 complex and two actin monomers, branching off from an existing actin filament. If the VCA domain were to have a preference for the b-CYA isoform, that would explain the dependence on b-CYA for actin-based virus transport. Two bacterial expression plasmids were constructed: one expressing a glutathione Stransferase (GST)-tagged VCA domain and another expressing a GSTtagged VCA domain containing two arginine-alanine substitutions in its actin-binding region, VCA-R410A/R438A (called VCA-RA/RA), which effectively abrogate actin binding (Co, Wong, Gierke, Chang, & Taunton, 2007) . GST-tagged VCA proteins were expressed in bacteria, purified and used to enrich for actin by passing cell lysates over the bound, immobilized protein and probing for actin isoforms. As expected, actin bound to GST-VCA and did not bind to the GST-VCA RA/RA ( Figure   6a ). The next step was to examine whether the actin that bound to the VCA domain was specifically one CYA isoform. Both anti-b-CYA and anti-g-CYA antibodies bound to an immunoblot of cell lysates passed over GST-VCA protein (Figure 6b) , suggesting that the VCA domain does not specifically bind to one CYA over the other.",

            "text": "There has been increasing interest in the roles of the two CYA isoforms, b-CYA and g-CYA, as two distinct proteins with differing localizations and functions despite their high homology and overlapping expression. For example, while b-CYA localises to stress fibres and cellcell contacts, g-CYA is abundant in lamellipodial structures and is important for cell motility (Dugina et al., 2009) . Studies have identified isoform-specific functions during multiple cellular processes (Artman et al., 2014; Hajkova, Nyman, Lindberg, & Karlsson, 2000; Joseph et al., 2014; Pasquier et al., 2015) , as well as distinct requirements in the replication cycle of viruses like coronaviruses (Wang, Fang, Xiao, Chen, Tam, & Liu, 2009) While our data support a role for b-CYA knockdown in the release of EEV through actin nucleation, we also found that it did not disrupt the intracellular movement of enveloped virus particles to the cell periphery. This is as expected, as both the generation of intracellular enveloped VACV, as well as their transport to the cell periphery, is independent from release of EEV particles (Horsington et al., 2013; Lynn, Horsington, Ter, Han, Chew, Diefenbach, . . . Newsome, 2012; Payne and Kristensson, 1982; Ward and Moss, 2001) . difference in the number of virus particles either being released or being transported to the cell periphery under g-CYA depletion. As the major effects observed by Po'uha et al (2013) were a decrease in microtubule shortening rates and a delayed metaphase-anaphase transition, this may have been insufficient to grossly perturb the microtubule-based transport of VACV. Reducing levels of g-CYA did lead to increased speed of VACV undergoing actin-based transport but this did not lead to additional phenotypes in virus release or cell-to-cell spread. The knockdown of g-CYA in HeLa cells causes a compensatory increase in the levels of b-CYA (Figure 2b) , which indicates that comets with greater speeds observed in g-CYA-depleted cells may be caused by a shift in the ratio of CYAs in favor of b-CYA. This observation is in agreement with the previously shown ability of b-CYA to polymerize at faster rates than g-CYA in a reconstituted system (Bergeron, Zhu, Thiem, Friderici, & Rubenstein, 2010) .",

            "text": "Our most surprising observation was the increase in VACV plaque size during b-CYA knockdown in GBM cells. g-CYA is a known regulator of Rho-associated kinase (ROCK)-mediated cell migration, and the knockdown of g-CYA has been shown to reduce cell migration (Dugina et al., 2009; Shum et al., 2011) . Additionally, we observed a significant increase in g-CYA expression during b-CYA knockdown in GBM cells, which may have had an additive effect, contributing to increased viral plaque size. An enhancement of directional cell migration during b-CYA depletion, as well as a reduction in migration during g-CYA depletion, has also been observed previously (Dugina et al., 2009) . This increase in motility during b-CYA knockdown could also be playing a role in VACV virus-induced cell motility, contributing to an increased plaque size. The VACV protein F11 is also responsible for virusinduced cell migration, through its inhibition of RhoA signalling (Cordeiro, Guerra, Arakawa, Dodding, Esteban, & Way, 2009; Valderrama, Cordeiro, Schleich, Frischknecht, & Way, 2006) . This may explain why we have not observed a corresponding reduction in plaque size during g-CYA knockdown. Interestingly, b-CYA synthesis has also been associated with Rho signalling (Latham, Yu, Tullio, Adelstein, & Singer, 2001 ) and the use of a Rho kinase inhibitor can cause the selective disorganization of b-CYA bundles while leaving g-CYA undisturbed (Dugina et al., 2009) . Clearly there is a strong link between b-CYA and Rho signalling, such that the depletion of b-CYA may have a significant effect on Rho and its downstream signalling targets. The use of ROCK inhibitors under conditions of band g-CYA knockdown may, in future studies, clarify the complex networks involved in this process. It is evident, however, that cell motility is an important determinant of VACV plaque size.",

Clearly blocking all actin functions would be highly detrimental to a cell. Our results indicate that specific pathogenic mechanisms can be successfully targeted, even for such a fundamental process as actin nucleation, by inhibiting one isoform of a highly conserved group of proteins. Our data was unable to uncover the precise mechanism by which b-CYA actin is required during VACV-induced actin nucleation, but they suggest a link between the activity of a particular nucleator, N-WASP, and an actin isoform, b-CYA. This raises the tantalizing possibility that nucleators may be subject to regulation by isoform availability, which is consistent with the highly localized distributions of b-CYA and actin-CYA at the subcellular level.",

VACV-associated actin comets present under b-CYA knockdown conditions exhibited faint accumulations of b-CYA at the interface of the virus particle and actin comet, which is the site of F-actin nucleation. We compared the length of b-CYA staining to VACV-comet length, which revealed an average ratio of 0.68 6 0.14 (under b-CYA knockdown) and 0.81 6 0.12 (scrambled control). These data indicate a correlation between the amount of b-CYA recruited to the virus and the resulting comet length. Z-stack images of hCMEC/D3 treated with CYA isoform-specific siRNA and infected with VACV-WR show that in scrambled siRNA-and g-CYA-targeting siRNA-treated cells (cells where actin comets were most readily seen), both gand b-CYA isoforms comprise the VACVinduced actin comets, irrespective of whether they were present at the basal or apical membrane (Supporting Information Fig. S2A-B). To further characterize the effect of b-CYA depletion on actin comet formation, hCMEC/D3 cells were infected with VACV following treatment with respective siRNAs, and visualized by IFA. Infected cells were picked at random (by their characteristic peri-nuclear virus factories) and of those, cells with 10 or more actin comets were counted. Treatment of cells with siRNA targeting b-CYA resulted in a significant reduction in the percentage of infected cells containing at least 10 actin comets (Figure 4a). There was no significant difference seen in the g-CYA-depleted and scrambled siRNA-treated cells. In addition to a reduction in the number of actin comets under b-CYA depletion, we also recorded a reduction in their length (Figure 4b), which is related to the stability of actin comets and EV release (Horsington et al., 2013; Weisswange, Newsome, Schleich, & Way, 2009). VACV-WR was used to infect hCMEC/D3 or HeLa cells treated with siRNA specific for either b-CYA or g-CYA, which were then fixed 8 hpi. In both cell types examined, VACV-induced actin comets produced in b-CYA knockdown cells were significantly shorter compared to those produced in the g-CYA knockdown or scrambled siRNA-treated cells. There was no significant difference in comet length between the g-CYA knockdown and scrambled siRNA-treated cells. Despite the decrease in comet length observed under conditions of b-CYA depletion, live-cell imaging of infected cells labelled with Lifeact-GFP revealed no significant difference in the speed of virus motility (",

We visualized N-WASP and Src in VACV-infected cells treated for CYA siRNA knockdown (Figure 5b,c). Depletion of b-CYA or g-CYA did not lead to overt changes in the recruitment of Src or N-WASP to virus particles, suggesting that the phenotypes we have observed in virus motility are downstream of these critical signalling molecules. Cell-associated extracellular virus was enumerated by staining cells with anti-B5 antibody (against viral envelope protein B5) prior to permeabilizing the cells, such that only enveloped virus particles at the cell surface would be labelled. There was no significant difference in the number of anti-B5-stained virus particles at the cell surface between all three siRNA treatment conditions (Figure 5d).

While these reports revealed a role for b-CYA in the early stages of viral infection, from viral gene expression and replication to assembly, our study supports a requirement for b-CYA in the initiation of actin comets induced by VACV during the late stages of infection.Depletion of b-CYA quelled VACV-induced actin nucleation, implicating a specific requirement for this isoform rather than a general reduction in actin expression. As is typical for siRNA-mediated knockdown, the loss of b-CYA expression was not complete, with a reduction to approximately 20% (on average for both cell types tested) of control levels, which suggests a threshold at which reduced levels no longer supports actin nucleation. Levels of b-CYA recruited to VACV particles correlated with comet length, even under b-CYA knockdown, and at least some accumulation of b-CYA was evident at the viral surface in all cases. Indeed due to the variability of knockdown at the cellular level, we could observe cells with low b-CYA expression that gave rise to few virus-associated comets. These results are consistent with an absolute, albeit dosage-sensitive, requirement for b-CYA in VACV actin nucleation and actin-based motility. Previous studies have also demonstrated significant morphological and functional changes in various cell types with incomplete knockdown of CYA isoforms, such as taking on a less or a more contractile phenotype, or an increase/ decrease in lamellipodial structures, stress fibres, and cell motility(Dugina et al., 2009;Pasquier et al., 2015;Shum, Pasquier, Po'uha, O'Neill, Chaponnier, Gunning, & Kavallaris, 2011).",

This made it challenging to find singular infected cells to quantify the number of virus particles reaching the surface and/or number of actin comets produced per cell.
