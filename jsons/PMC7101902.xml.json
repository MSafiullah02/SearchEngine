HPS is classified as primary or secondary, the latter being more frequent [1]. Some fatal cases caused by some types of influenza A, such as H3N2 or H5N1, complicated with HPS have sporadically been reported [2\u20134]. We present a successfully treated case of severe influenza A (H1N1) pneumonia complicated with virus-associated hemophagocytic syndrome (VAHS) by combination therapy of steroid pulse and erythromycin IV, which is the first such case ever reported as far as we know. Physicians should recognize the presence of VAHS caused by influenza A (H1N1), which could result in poor outcomes.",

She had a history of rheumatic arthritis, which did not require medication. Chest radiography demonstrated infiltrates in both lung fields. Chest computed tomography (CT) also revealed ground-grass opacities scattered all over the lung (Figs. 1 and 2). Although no subjective respiratory symptoms were experienced, she had severe respiratory failure with oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 78% (room air) at first visit, and oxygen therapy was started with noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NPPV). Flu-antigen tests twice consecutively were both negative. Bronchial alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was performed. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in BALF specimen confirmed a result positive for novel swine-origin influenza A (N1H1), and she was diagnosed with influenza A (H1N1) pneumonia. She exhibited pancytopenia without any subjective symptoms (Table 1). HPS was diagnosed by bone-marrow aspiration (Fig. 3). Therapies were begun with Peramivir 600 mg/day for 5 days for influenza infection and combination therapy of steroid pulse and erythromycin 1,000 mg/day IV for 5 days for acute respiratory failure and H1N1-associated HPS. Her respiratory function gradually recovered, and NPPV was discontinued on day 3. Pancytopenia was also cured by day 14 without any symptoms. Enteral administration of steroid following IV administration was started with oral prednisolone 60 mg/day, and the dose was reduced to 30, 20, and 15 mg per day every 3 days and was discontinued on day 15. She was discharged on day 21.\n\n\n\n",

Generally, influenza patients suffer greatly from general fatigue, high fever, and systemic arthritis. Therefore, symptoms associated with HPS may be masked. Physicians are aware of the presence of severe complications of influenza, such as pneumonia, encephalitis, asthma attack, and myocarditis [6]. However, influenza viruses, including the H1N1 virus, are not considered to be pathogens of VAHS. As pancytopenia could result in fatality, complete blood count should cautiously be monitored, even though pancytopenia might be induced by drugs or by benign disease. Long-term neutropenia would increase the risk of severe bacterial infections. Thrombocytopenia could result in spontaneous bleeding, which can occur in the central nervous system with a fatal outcome. Severe anemia could contribute to organ dysfunction, such as heart failure and tissue hypoxia. It has previously been reported that HPS developed disseminated intravascular coagulation and multiple organ dysfunction resulting in high mortality rates [7].",

There might be a correlation between cytokine storm and influenza pneumonia resulting in ARDS or VAHS.

Some physicians previously reported that macrolides could be effective in preventing and treating acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (CB) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [10, 11]. It is evident that macrolides decrease neutrophil chemotaxis and infiltration into the respiratory epithelium down-regulate adhesion molecule expression and enhance neutrophil apoptosis [12, 13]. Theoretically, it is reasonable that erythromycin could demonstrate its immunomodulatory effect rather than its antimicrobial one in this case.",
