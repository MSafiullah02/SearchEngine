Rarely is CSF solely used to provide an etiological diagnosis (exceptions include cytological visualization of infectious agents or overtly neoplastic cells), but analysis may significantly narrow the field of pathophysiological differentials, guiding further diagnostic and therapeutic options. CSF analysis is most sensitive in detecting inflammatory disease.3 Positive findings in CSF tend to be more diagnostically helpful compared with negative findings but are often nonspecific because many different diseases may cause a common CSF pathology (e.g., neutrophilic pleocytosis).4 Occasionally, the magnitude of change within the CSF may be as instructive as the character of the change (e.g., a marked increase in protein concentration raising diagnostic concern for feline infectious peritonitis, marked neutrophilic pleocytosis raising diagnostic concern for steroid-responsive meningitis\u2013arteritis in a young dog in pain).4 More frequently, however, specific disease etiologies will present with CSF changes of variable character and magnitude. CSF that falls within laboratory reference intervals should never be used to rule out a differential diagnosis because negative findings may represent early or mild disease, disease suppressed or masked by therapeutic intervention, or a disease process that does not present within the particular area of the extracellular space being sampled. CSF analysis may or may not correlate with imaging studies; a retrospective study of 92 cats receiving magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for spinal signs showed that abnormal CSF was not a predictor for abnormal MRI.5 In another study, approximately 25% of dogs with intracranial signs and inflammatory CSF had normal brain MRI results.6\n",

Both sides of the cover-slipped hemocytometer are loaded with unstained CSF, which is then placed in a humidified container for 10 to 15 minutes to allow cells to settle on the glass. Because the fluid is unstained, the microscope condenser is lowered to improve contrast. Erythrocytes and nucleated cells are differentiated by size, refraction, granularity, and smoothness of plasma membrane.21 Some laboratories stain CSF samples with new methylene blue (NMB), as leukocytes will take up stain, whereas erythrocytes remain unstained, making differentiation of leukocytes (specifically small lymphocytes) and erythrocytes easier (Fig. 14.1\n).22 A small volume of CSF is drawn into a capillary tube coated with NMB or a tube that has a small volume of NMB followed by an air pocket.22 The tube containing NMB and CSF is gently rocked back and forth, allowing the cells to take up some stain without diluting the CSF with a volume of NMB.22 The hemocytometer is then loaded, and each population is counted and totals are calculated, as follows: Neubauer chamber: (1) both areas of large nine squares are counted, and the average of the number of leukocytes and erythrocytes is found; (2) the average is multiplied by 9 to get the cells per microliter (cells/\u03bcL).10\n",

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)\u2013based assays for antibody detection and PCR-based assays for nucleic acid detection of several medically important microbes have been developed for use on CSF and may be instructive in the diagnosis of viral, rickettsial, protozoal, or fungal diseases.20 A large canine study that included a subset of 16 dogs with neoplastic or inflammatory disease showed that CSF titer provided diagnosis in 25% of cases.3 Antibody assays should be interpreted cautiously because the presence of antibody may indicate prior exposure or vaccination rather than active infection. Moreover, compromise to the BBB in states of inflammation may translate to the presence of antibodies within the CSF without local production. Occasionally cross-reactive antibodies may be present that do not represent presence of the disease agent under assessment. Similarly, specimens for PCR should be submitted to a laboratory with strict quality control to minimize false-negative and false-positive results. Poor collection technique may result in false-positive results, especially for bacterial species that are ubiquitous in the environment.27 As with other aspects of CSF analysis, a negative PCR result does not definitively rule out the presence of a pathogen because of the sampling limitation of a small portion of the extracellular space.20\n",

CSF enzymes originate from the bloodstream, the CNS, or cells within CSF.10 One study of 34 cats with noninflammatory CNS disease showed that measurement of CSF activities of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and creatine kinase (CK) were not diagnostically sensitive but may be useful in detection of acute injury.28 Multiple studies have correlated elevations in CSF CK activity with poor prognosis in dogs with neurological disease or spinal cord injury.29, 30 Immunoassays for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and S-100 calcium-binding protein have shown elevations of both molecules in the CSF of experimentally induced hypothyroid dogs, suggesting endothelial and glial contribution to increased BBB permeability in this population.31 Myelin basic protein (MBP) has been found to be elevated in lumbar CSF in dogs with degenerative myelopathy, supporting the conclusion that it is a demyelinating lesion.32 MBP concentration is elevated in the CSF of dogs affected by intervertebral disk herniation (IVDH) and has been found to be an independent predictor of poor prognosis.33 Beta-2-microglobulin, a major histocompatibility complex I (MHC-I)\u2013associated molecule, has been assayed by using ELISA and found to be elevated in the CSF of dogs with IVDH and inflammatory disease and also positively correlated with normal total nucleated cell count (TNCC).34 The amino acids tryptophan and glutamine have been found to be elevated in the CSF of dogs with portosystemic shunts because of abnormal ammonia metabolism.35 One study found increased oxytocin in the CSF of dogs with spinal cord compression, where it is believed to have an analgesic effect.36 Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate neurotransmitter concentrations have been measured in dogs with epilepsy.37\n",

Varying reports on the effect of blood contamination on TNCC, leukocyte differential, and protein concentration have been published.43, 44, 45, 46 Deciding whether increased TNCC or protein concentration is the result of hemodilution alone or a significant change concurrent with hemodilution necessarily remains, to an extent, a subjective assessment and must be critically evaluated in light of the magnitude of CSF findings along with the other pertinent facts of the case. Correction formulas for CSF parameters in the face of hemodilution (e.g., adding 1 nucleated cell/\u03bcL per 100 or 500 RBCs/\u03bcL) are unreliable.45, 46 In a recent study of 106 canine CSF samples without pleocytosis (TNCC <5/\u03bcL) but containing at least 500 RBCs/\u03bcL, the mean percentage of neutrophils (45.2% versus 5.7%), percentage of samples with eosinophils present (36.8% versus 6.8%), and mean protein concentration (40 mg/dL versus 26 mg/dL) were found to be significantly increased in the samples with blood contamination when compared with controls.47 Significant RBC contamination warrants repeat sampling, if possible. Marked hemorrhage or evidence of prior hemorrhage (erythrophagocytosis, xanthochromia, hemosiderin-laden macrophages) may be useful in the diagnosis of CNS trauma, which may be accompanied by neutrophilic to mixed cell pleocytosis and mild increase in protein concentration.4\n",

As such, it is a nonspecific change that indicates CNS damage or hyperproteinemic disease and is consistent with disease of any etiology (e.g., trauma, metabolic, infectious, inflammatory, degenerative, or neoplastic). Caution should be exercised when diagnosing ACD if the sample is hemodiluted (>500 RBCs/\u03bcL).47 As is true for pleocytosis, inflammation of the meninges and superficial regions of parenchyma will result in greater CSF protein elevations than for lesions that are more remote from the SAS.",

Only two species at this time are medically important: (1) Cryptococcus neoformans (var. neoformans and var. grubii) and (2) Cryptococcus gattii. In a recent study of 31 dogs with cryptococcosis, 68% had CNS infection, with neurological signs being the most common reason for presentation.55 Dogs and cats with cryptococcosis typically have pleocytoses and elevated protein concentrations, but pleocytoses may be variably neutrophilic, eosinophilic, mononuclear, or mixed. In a recent study of 15 dogs with CNS cryptococcosis, organisms were found in 11 of 15 CSF samples (Fig. 14.10, Fig. 14.9\n).56 All affected dogs had pleocytoses that were mixed to mononuclear, whereas cats tended to have neutrophilic pleocytoses.56 Of the samples, 11 of 12 also had increased protein concentrations (mean 494 mg/dL), which were significantly higher than in cats in the same study (mean 45 mg/dL).56 Capsular antigen latex agglutination testing on serum or CSF is highly sensitive and specific and is recommended if cryptococcosis is suspected but organisms are not visualized cytologically.57 This test may yield negative results if disease is present but localized (i.e., within the respiratory tract), so appropriate clinical signs should guide testing. Culture of CSF may also be helpful and may distinguish C. neoformans from C. gattii with the use of selective media. The finding of inflammatory foci on MRI may be supportive of the presence of fungal disease; cryptococcosis may result in mass lesions, meningitis, or pseudocyst formation.",

A recent study found that 42% of 62 cats with cryptococcosis had CNS infection, but respiratory signs were still a more common reason for presentation.55 Mild to marked neutrophilic or mononuclear pleocytosis may occur, with variable and occasionally normal protein concentrations.4 A study of cats with CNS cryptococcosis showed organisms in 9 of 11 of the CSF samples, and a majority of cases (9 of 10) had neutrophilic pleocytosis and increased protein concentration (8 of 10).56 Eosinophilic pleocytosis may also occur. Capsular antigen latex agglutination testing on serum or CSF is recommended for confirmation of Cryptococcus spp. infection, with rare false-negative reactions if disease is highly localized.",

Hypergammaglobulinemia, elevated serum \u03b11-acid glycoprotein (AGP), MRI abnormalities (typically involving the ventricular lining and meninges), and positive feline coronavirus IgG titer or PCR from serum, tissue, or CSF are supportive but not specifically diagnostic, and negative findings do not rule out disease.20, 63, 65\n",

Chronically, pleocytosis may change to a more mononuclear or mixed population (Fig. 14.12\n) and may become mild or even fall into reference intervals.72 A study of 20 affected dogs showed neutrophilic pleocytosis in 12 of 20 cases and mononuclear pleocytosis in 8 of 20 cases.72 Concurrent elevations of serum and CSF IgA titers (elevated IgG and IgM fractions may be present), serum concentration of cross-reactive protein (CRP), or serum \u03b12-macroglobulin is diagnostically supportive but not specific.20, 50 Increases in IgA have been linked to a T-helper 2 (Th2)\u2013dominated immune response driven by elevated interleukin-4 (IL-4) and decreased IL-2 and interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3).73 Serum amyloid A (SAA), serum AGP, and serum haptoglobin may also be elevated.74 Another study of 36 dogs with SRMA reported statistically significant elevations of CSF and serum CRP, but not serum \u03b12-macroglobulin, in dogs with SRMA compared with other neurological diseases.75 In a study of 20 dogs, serum CRP was positively correlated with CSF TNCC.72 Additionally, serum haptoglobin and serum and CSF IgA remained increased throughout successful treatment, indicating that these parameters are more useful for diagnosis than for monitoring therapy.72 Serum and CSF concentrations of CRP and SAA have been documented to fall significantly during treatment, and repeat measurement of serum CRP or SAA may be used to guide therapy and predict relapse, which is less invasive and more sensitive than repeat CSF sampling.72, 74, 75 Rare cases have been documented in cats with marked mononuclear or mixed pleocytosis and mild to moderate protein concentration elevations.4\n",

Moreover, in the absence of overtly neoplastic cells, no defined patterns connect specific tumors with specific types of inflammatory pleocytoses. Neutrophilic pleocytosis of unspecified magnitude was found in the CSF of 2 of 11 cats with spinal lymphoma and in 3 of 7 cats with nonlymphoma spinal neoplasia (astrocytoma or osteosarcoma).81 Additionally, the remaining four cats with nonlymphoma spinal tumors (meningioma, peripheral nerve sheath tumor, plasma cell tumor) had either normal CSF or ACD of unspecified magnitude.81 Metastatic tumors to the CNS should also be considered in a patient with neurological signs.",

Both NLE and NME are believed to have an immune-mediated basis, and recent data support that in Pugs with NME, canine leukocyte antigen gene aberrations exist.93 Meningoencephalitis is rapidly progressive and affects a variety of generally young to middle-aged toy-breed dogs, including the Pug, Shih Tzu, Papillon, Maltese, Chihuahua, Yorkshire terrier, French bulldog, Pekingese, West Highland White terrier, Boston terrier, Japanese Spitz, and Miniature Pinscher breeds.20, 94 A study of CSF from 14 Pugs with NME showed 12 of 14 with pleocytoses of varying severity (mean 120 cells/\u03bcL).95 Of these dogs, 66% had a lymphocytic pleocytosis, 17% had a mononuclear pleocytosis, and 17% had a mixed cell pleocytosis (Fig. 14.13\n)95; 11 of 14 dogs had elevated protein concentrations (mean 88.4 mg/dL).95 Another study of three dogs showed one with ACD and two with moderate to marked (40\u2013220 cells/\u03bcL) neutrophilic to lymphocytic pleocytosis.94 MRI findings may help support a diagnosis, but only histopathological examination of lesions provides definitive proof.",

Increased serum liver or muscle enzymes and electromyography (EMG) may be helpful if concordant signs are present.99 A variety of serological techniques to assay for the presence of antibody are available, and a titer greater than 1:64 is supportive of diagnosis. Antibody detection in serum or CSF, coupled with PCR of CSF or other potentially affected tissues, is currently recommended for the definitive diagnosis of CNS neosporosis.20\n",

Cats with neoplasia may have lymphocytic pleocytoses (suggestive of lymphoma), mild to moderate mononuclear to mixed cell pleocytoses (suggestive of nonlymphoma tumors), or normal CSF. One study examined six cases of feline CNS or multifocal lymphoma, which displayed pleocytoses of variable magnitude, absent to mildly elevated protein concentrations, and neoplastic cells visualized in 5 of 6 of the CSF samples.4 In this study, eight cats with CNS signs that were ultimately diagnosed with nonlymphoma tumors (e.g., meningioma, carcinoma, nerve sheath tumor) had mild CSF protein elevations and either normal TNCC (1 of 8) or mild to moderate mononuclear or mixed cell pleocytosis (7 of 8).4 Another study of 11 cats with spinal lymphoma showed neoplastic cells visualized in one case and hemodilution, ACD, or neutrophilic pleocytosis in the remainder of cases.81 A case report of feline multiple myeloma involving lumbar vertebrae and associated soft tissues exhibited cisternal CSF with an elevated protein concentration of 290 mg/dL and mild pleocytosis (8 cells/\u03bcL) consisting of a majority of neoplastic plasma cells.111 Diagnosis was further confirmed by abnormal urine protein electrophoresis and bone marrow aspiration.111\n",
