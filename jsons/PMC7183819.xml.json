Ecological security becomes an important research domain internationally, especially urban ecological security. As highly populated eco-systems, cities always have more fragile ecological environments (Gao et al. 2017). Ecological security is regarded as one of the most important national survival strategies (Zhao et al. 2014). With the rapid development of China\u2019s urbanization process, urban ecosystem has become the important part of ecological security. It is both a result of natural ecological system development, and also an inevitable outcome of human ecological system development within a certain stage. The regional scale provides a reasonable spatial context for exploring the eco-security of mega-cities or metropolitan areas (Xiang et al. 2018). However, the existing research lacks a comprehensive understanding of the influencing factors for biodiversity at a regional scale, and most of the research methods are focused on the environmental or ecosystem perspective to evaluate the urban security instead of a system aspect. This paper aims to identify the possible improvement space for urban ecological security evaluation, and employ a brittle structure model from complex system perspective. Based on the theoretical and empirical study analysis, it is expected to provide some policy recommendation on the improvement for urban ecological security evaluation and management.",

Urban ecosystem is an artificial ecosystem regarding people as the center compositing with nature, economy, and society (Ma 1984). Natural system refers to the necessary basic physical environment for the urban residents living and development; it includes the life and non-life elements like sunlight, air, water, soil, plants, animals, microorganisms, and natural landscape. Economic system mainly involved with human economic activities and the development in primary industry, secondary industry, and tertiary industry, such as production, manufacture, consumption closely related to human activities, the science and technology, communications, finance, trade, transportation, and construction, related to the industries development. For the social system, it mainly refers to the related fields of urban residential cultural life and material life, such as housing, food, health, education, services, culture and law (Ma 1984; Kang 1997; Scerri and James 2010; Mi and Peng 2014). Detail framework is shown in Fig. 1. The natural system, economic system, and social system could connect and interact with each other; only when these three forming systems keep in an orderly and stable state, it can be possible the urban ecological system to achieve the sustainable development.",

The other theoretical framework model, such as driving force-state\u2013response (DSR) model, driving force-press-state-impact-response (DPSIR) model, and driving forces-pressure-state-exposure- response (DPSER) model, are the evolutionary variants based on PSR model (Pang and Wang 2014; Chen and Zhou 2005; Zhu and Fu 2015). Nathwani et al. (2019) expanded DSR model to DPSIR with five factors of driving force (D), pressure (P), state (S), impact (I), and response (R) and pointed that quantifying the resilience of an ecological system requires a detailed understanding of the vulnerabilities and interactions within a complex web of interconnected social, technological, and economic networks. DPSIR model can help to identify the different roles these factors play in the urban ecological security system.",

Geographic information system refers to a computer tool through which it can be used to collect, store and extract, transform, and display the spatial data. It has strong ability of data processing and spatial analysis. Global positioning system (GPS) refers to the technology determining the specific geographical location of regional unit in large scale. It usually integrates Three-S technology to dynamically monitor the relationship, ecological risk assessment, and management between the ecology and human activities (Geoffery et al. 2006; Xiao and Chen 2002; Wackenagel and William 1996).",

It holds the views that some potential spatial patterns are existed in the landscape; the pattern is composed of key points, location, and layout, which is very important to the certain ecological processes, that is called the landscape security pattern. It is requested to make comprehensive evaluation for various types of potential ecological impact from the structure of the ecosystem.",

We put the actual status collection of the brittleness factor into set A. In order to verify whether the actual collection safe or not, the authors defined the fourth safety status level (poor) of urban ecological system as a benchmark set B. In this way, the authors can employ the theory of set pair to quantitatively analyze the urban ecological system through the comparative analysis between the state set A and benchmark set B. If the actual state set A is calculated as the fourth level (poor), then the brittleness factor is identified as the same level of urban ecological security problem, which leads to the collapse of the urban ecosystem. If the actual state of set A is in the first security state level (optimal), then it indicates a brittleness opposite against the urban ecological security problems, namely, it can resist the collapse of the urban ecosystem; If the actual state of set A is in the third safety level (middle) or in the secondary (good), then the brittle factor and the urban ecological security problems will occur a brittle fluctuation, namely, the role of brittleness factors to the urban ecological system is instable (Wei et al. 2003; Guo et al. 2007).
