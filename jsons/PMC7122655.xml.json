A viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) is the most common infection of the respiratory tract.In developing countries, acute respiratory infection remains a leading cause of childhood mortality, causing an estimated 1.5\u20132 million deaths annually in children younger than 5 years of age.In developed countries viruses are responsible for most upper and lower respiratory tract infections, including pharyngitis and pneumonia.Although the degree of fever cannot differentiate between viral and bacterial diseases, high fever is associated with a greater incidence of serious bacterial diseases such as pneumonia or meningitis.Worldwide, diarrhoeal disease is the leading cause of childhood deaths under 5 years of age.If the fever does not have an evident source, urinary tract infection should be considered, particularly if the fever is greater than 39.0 \u00b0C and longer than 24\u201348 h.Widespread vaccinations against bacteria causing meningitis, such as Hib, and vaccines against meningococci and pneumococci have dramatically reduced the incidence of meningitis.A child with fever and non-blanching rash should be promptly evaluated to exclude meningococcal diseases.Young children with malaria may present with irregular fever and not with typical paroxysms of fever, occurring particularly in early falciparum infection or as a consequence of previous chemoprophylaxis, which modifies the typical pattern of fever.\n",

Infection may result from inhalation, self-inoculation to the nasal mucosa or airborne inoculation to the conjunctival mucosa. Children tend to have greater concentrations of viruses in the nasal secretion and shed them for longer periods of time than adults. Viraemia is less common and the infection is usually restricted to the mucosa, including the sinuses and Eustachian tube. Viral URTI may be complicated by secondary bacterial infections including acute otitis media and sinusitis. Acute idiopathic pericarditis (presents as chest pain and pericardial rubs on auscultation) is a rare complication that is usually preceded by a recent URTI. Infection with influenza viruses occurs during annual winter epidemics and is usually a self-limited illness. However, it can cause severe illness and deaths, particularly in children with high-risk medical conditions and neurological, genetic and chromosomal disorders.",

There is evidence that vitamin D can prevent acute viral URTI.Herbal preparations are often used. Ivy leaf extract (Hedera helix) is popular as an antitussive in many European countries.

Apart from the rash and the tongue, there is essentially no difference between streptococcal tonsillitis and scarlet fever. Fever in both conditions usually ranges from 39 to 40.5 \u00b0C peaking on the second day of illness. Without treatment, the temperature usually subsides on the fifth day, whereas penicillin therapy causes a rapid normalization of temperature within 12\u201324 h.\nPeritonsillar abscess is a rare suppurative complication of tonsillitis causing a toxic appearance of the child, fluctuant peritonsillar mass and asymmetric deviation of the uvula.\nGingivostomatitis is usually caused by herpes simplex infection in infants and small children. It is characterized by irritability, anorexia and fever, which is usually in the range 38.5\u201339.5 \u00b0C (may also be as high as 40\u201340.5 \u00b0C). The child has painful oral vesicles that soon rupture. Submaxillary lymphadenitis may occur. The disease is self-limited and lasts about a week.Coxsackievirus A may cause herpangina. The initial temperature ranges from normal up to 41 \u00b0C; the temperature tends to be higher in younger children. Other features include headache and vomiting. Throat inspection reveals discrete punctuate vesicles, surrounded by erythematous rings on the soft palate, anterior pillars and uvula.\nDiphtheria, which develops insidiously, has a grey, thick membrane which bleeds easily if removed.

Fever can therefore be seen as a marker of mild asthma. Similar observations were made at the turn of the last century when patients were noted to obtain a temporary relief of their asthma in association with fever. Subsequently various methods (diathermy) were used to treat asthma. It is possible that:Fever as a response to infection can limit the spread of infection by enhancing the host defence mechanisms to eliminate the viruses.As airway inflammation is a cardinal feature of asthma, cortisol, a potent glucocorticoid, is known to be elevated in febrile illness and could play a role as an endogenous anti-inflammatory agent.\n\n",

Unlike most infectious complications in cancer patients, PJP may occur while the patient is in remission from the primary cause. Clinical manifestations include fever, cough, cyanosis, marked tachypnoea with intercostal retraction and a paucity of physical signs of pneumonia. Among 1251 children with malignancies, PJP was identified in 51 (4.1%) [12]. Fever was the first sign of abnormality and occurred in almost all patients with, or shortly preceding, tachypnoea.

About 12\u201348 h following ingestion of contaminated ingestion of contaminated food, the onset is abrupt with nausea, fever, and crampy abdominal pain, followed by loose, watery diarrhoea, occasionally containing mucus, blood or both. The illness is indistinguishable from Shigella infection. Vomiting is a not a striking feature in salmonellosis.

Endotoxin releases IL-1 from macrophage into the circulation, accounting for the fever and other systemic manifestations of the disease. Cytokines are responsible for the symptoms and development of the protective mechanisms in the disease. Mean serum concentrations of TNF-alpha, TNF-gamma and IL-12 are increased during the acute phase of the disease. IL-8 and IL-10 are involved in the pathogenesis of rotavirus GE.Diarrhoea is usually more frequent in afebrile than in febrile cases.Children with bacterial GE are more likely to develop high fever than those with viral GE, and there is a significant relation higher fever and shigella GE.In a study from Finland [7] comprising 102 children salmonella gastroenteritis, 15 had a fever >40 \u00b0C, 66 had a fever of 38\u201339.9 \u00b0C and 21 had a temperature of <37.9 \u00b0C. There was a significant correlation between the degree of fever and the duration of organism excretion: a fever of >40 \u00b0C had the shortest and no fever the longest duration of excretion (Table 5.9). Fever therefore appears to have a favourable prognostic influenza on the duration of salmonella excretion. The gastrointestinal tract acts as a major barrier against the potentially noxious substances, such as microbes. Immunological defences include secretory IgA, macrophage and activated T-lymphocytes in the Peyer patches and lamina propria. Fever is beneficial to the infected host by enhancing macrophage and T- and B-cell activity.Convulsion may occur during the diarrhoeal disease. About 10% develop febrile or afebrile seizures. Febrile seizures (FS) are particularly common with shigella infection. Occasionally, afebrile seizure may occur in association with dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, hypoglycaemia or hypocalcaemia. A third form of seizure is an afebrile seizure, particularly during viral GE, without dehydration of electrolyte imbalance. This type of seizure is usually benign. CSF and EEG are normal. Paracetamol has not been shown to prevent FS.Ibuprofen is an antipyretic that is frequently administered for febrile children with GE. Acute renal insufficiency may occur in association with ibuprofen and should therefore be avoided.\n\n",

Eventually, the mononuclear cells rupture and release many organisms, which are subsequently engulfed by other phagocytic cells.A few months after the initial bite, the patients develop symptoms manifested by varying degree and patterns of fever (see below), emaciation, massive hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, profound weakness and pancytopenia. The weakness is mainly caused by anaemia and chronic infection. The pancytopenia is caused by a combination of invading the bone marrow by Leishmania, hypersplenism and autoimmune process. Thrombocytopenia may be severe enough to produce bleeding. Leukopenia causes secondary bacterial infections, such as pneumonia.Death occurs within 1\u20132 years in 80\u201390% of untreated patients.\n",
