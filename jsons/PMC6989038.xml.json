Compared to the extensive literature modeling spreading dynamics on static networks, we lack a thorough understanding of the particular effects of the temporal properties of network contacts. Meanwhile, recent studies have found that diverse temporal contact features, such as distributions of intercontact times, temporal correlation in intercontact times, and birth and death of nodes and links, may have very different impacts on the dynamics of spreading processes [1\u20138].",

            "text": "Concurrency, broadly defined as \u201crelationships that overlap in time\u201d [9], is one of the key elements affecting the extent and speed of disease spreading. Concurrency is a longstanding concept in epidemiology and has been considered in diverse contexts, including for understanding the epidemic potential of HIV [9\u201312]. Some studies have applied the concept as a property proportional to an average contact rate or an average degree in unit time [11,12] or as a link density of a reachable network converted from pair-to-pair contact patterns [10]. In another recent study, concurrency was considered as the number of links of an individual in unit time within a generative temporal activity model [13]. Whatever the particular definition of concurrency, the general idea is that increased concurrency increases the density of the effective network structure over which an infection is transmitted, resulting in a larger number of alternative paths between nodes, thus increasing the potential for greater spread through the population. As such, the general conclusion that higher concurrency increases the potential for epidemic spread seems to be trivial. However, the detailed mechanism of this increase is important to understand and to quantify to assess the impact of concurrency in a particular temporal network setting.",

            "text": "Motivated by previous work [9], we consider the reachability of the temporal contact network over which transmission can occur. Reachability is the density of the accessibility graph that includes an edge from node i to node j if and only if there is a temporally consistent path originating at i that can reach j in the underlying temporal contact network. That is, reachability quantifies the maximum possible impact of the infectious spreading by quantifying the fraction of node pairs that can be accessible via temporally consistent paths (see, e.g., [9,14\u201316]). Reachability is a useful metric not only because it measures the maximal substrate of infectious spreading, but also because it indicates how much temporal continuity can be ignored when one uses an aggregated static network to analyze infection dynamics [15]. The accessibility of a directed node pair quantifies whether there is any path along which a chain of edges can causally propagate the infection. Notions of accessibility and reachability have been suspected to be crucial elements for explaining the diversity of possible epidemic outbreak sizes [17] and have been applied to measure epidemic spreading potential of nodes in an animal trade network [18]. Similarly, Williams and Musolesi [19] applied a concept of reachability to measure the robustness of spatiotemporal networks. By directly measuring the maximal extent of temporally consistent paths, reachability controls the maximal extent of any general spreading dynamics on the temporal network, thus providing a benchmark for the overall potential for infection.",

Temporal concurrency is defined here as the fraction of pairs of links that overlap in time. Meanwhile, structural cohesion measures the effective connectedness in the underlying topology of the time-aggregated network, ignoring the temporal details of the individual edges. A good measure of structural cohesion should embody the notion that highly cohesive networks should be difficult to separate, i.e., by node or edge removal, into separate components. As such, we employ the definition of structural cohesion as the average number of node-independent paths between two nodes [20], as applied to the network that includes all edges over the total time period studied. We emphasize that structural cohesion is more than a simple function of edge density; rather, it is influenced by the organizational patterns of the connections. In particular, one can observe different amounts of structural cohesion even while keeping the total link density constant.",

Our approximate model focuses on networks that are treelike in the sense of having low structural cohesion, in an effort to develop and assess the accuracy of model approximations for the level of reachability in random temporal networks.

As such, the temporal concurrency of edges associated with a given node, measuring the probability that there are such edges overlapping in time, becomes by this independent and identically distributed assumption equivalent to the probability that any randomly selected pair of links overlaps in time.

As such, the increased error made by R\u00af in increasing from \u2329k\u232a\u22482 to 3 is expected, though the size of the resulting error emphasizes the apparent importance of available detours around these paths even for these small mean degrees. We note in particular that the R\u00af approximation is quite good at very low concurrency C, where the node-independent shortest paths presumably have greater dominance because longer paths along detours become even more unlikely to maintain temporal consistency. However, the limiting behavior of the approximation in the R\u21921 approach as C\u21921 is clearly incorrect.

Recalling the explicit role of the number \u03ba(i,j) of such paths between nodes i and j in our approximations, we ask whether the relationship between reachability and concurrency observed numerically might be captured by assuming some other effective values for \u03ba. In Fig. 7 we continue to consider reachability on the \u2329k\u232a\u22483 ER networks. Focusing for this figure only on R~s approximations built from p(k) degree distributions and p(\u2113) distributions of geodesic shortest paths, we reproduce here our regular R~s approximation using \u03ba(i,j)=min(ki,kj) from Fig. 4(b). This approximation overestimates the reachability at low concurrency because the p(\u2113) distribution of geodesic shortest paths are shorter on average than the full set of node-independent shortest paths (the latter used in our R~n approximations). As seen in Fig. 7, this overestimate at low concurrency can also be at least partially corrected for by decreasing the effective cohesion used in the approximation formulas to \u03ba=1.5. (For comparison, the average structural cohesion of the underlying ER networks is \u2329\u03ba\u232a\u22502.08.) Of perhaps greater interest, we see in Fig. 7 that the underestimated reachability at large C appears to be corrected for at this level of modeling by choosing an effective cohesion value of \u03ba=3.5, yielding a good approximation over the range 0.5\u2272C\u22641. We believe that identifying such effective cohesion values as modeled from other network features (as opposed to curve fitting here) may be an interesting direction for future work, as a means of extending the range of validity of our tree-based approximations.\n",

In contrast, there are other temporal network data sets that are in the form of lists of contacts that are present in each temporal snapshot, with the possibility that a given pair of nodes might be in contact at one time, not connected at a later instant, and then connected again at a still later moment. In such settings, it may be useful to distinguish the notion of instantaneous concurrency, counting concurrently appearing links at a contact time, from an interval concurrency calculated over all temporally interleaved links. That is, this notion of interval concurrency is equivalent to that obtained assuming that every edge is present for the full duration from its first appearance to its last. We studied the differences between instantaneous concurrency and interval concurrency, and the effect of these representations on reachability, for a variety of example networks in Ref. [32]. We found in that study that the change between the contact and interval representations barely affects the reachability of the sample empirical networks studied there. We believe this result emphasizes the importance of the start and end times, with the interevent contact time details being less important for setting the level of reachability in these cases. It will be worthwhile to further investigate the possible effects of substituting contact data with interval duration representations, especially as it impacts models for infection spread on temporal networks.",
