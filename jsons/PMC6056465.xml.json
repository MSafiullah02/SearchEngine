Influenza virus, or host responses to influenza virus, have been shown to disperse pneumococci from biofilms, potentiating invasion25.

A high concentration of pneumococcus in the nasopharynx has been demonstrated in pneumococcal pneumonia but this does not necessarily mean that the increase in pneumococcal concentration preceded the development of pneumonia28,29. To observe dynamic changes in pneumococcal concentration it is necessary to undertake a prospective longitudinal cohort study of nasopharyngeal carriage. Such a study with a pneumonia endpoint would be large, costly and complex. Here we used an existing longitudinal study of household viral transmission30 as the framework to examine the concentration of pneumococcal carriage in children aged <5 years before, during and after they acquired an URTI with RSV or rhinovirus.",

Under the parent protocol, 47 households were selected that contained at least one infant and one older sibling and were investigated for a period of 6 months covering one RSV season between December 2009 and June 2010. The households were selected from within the Kilifi Health and Demographic Surveillance System31 in rural coastal Kenya, from a population of predominantly subsistence farmers. Nasopharyngeal flocked swab (NPFS) specimens were collected and stored in viral transport medium (VTM), containing gentamicin, twice weekly irrespective of symptoms. While the WHO recommended method for nasopharyngeal pneumococcal detection is a swab stored in skim milk-tryptone-glucose-glycerol (STGG) to enable culture-based methods32, it is possible to both detect and quantify pneumococcal DNA in VTM29. Multiplex real-time PCR was performed on all samples to detect RSV A/B, adenovirus, rhinovirus and coronaviruses NL63, E229 & OC4333. Additionally, five households underwent rhinovirus typing of all samples positive for rhinovirus by sequencing of the VP4-VP2 junction34. Rhinovirus was so commonly detected that without typing, separate infection episodes could not be differentiated.",

In addition, nasopharyngeal samples were collected monthly in Peru, and four times in a year in Wisconsin, as opposed to twice weekly in our study.

Basic science, using human respiratory cell lines and mouse models, has demonstrated that RSV infection increases pneumococcal concentration, decreases bacterial clearance and promotes pneumococcal adherence. The host inflammatory response to respiratory viral infection may trigger pneumococcal dispersion from biofilms. The modest increase in pneumococcal concentration seen in both this study and the American studies27,41, on the context of large fluctuations in density of carriage between and within individuals, may indicate that increasing nasopharyngeal pneumococcal concentration is not a prerequisite to triggering pneumococcal invasion into the bloodstream or translocation into the lungs. Other effects of respiratory viruses may be more important; such as the inflammatory host response, volume of coryza, laryngeal compromise from coughing and possibly changing the expression of pneumococcal genes for phase-change to a more invasive phenotype. We also do not fully understand the relative contributions of pneumococcal serotype and strain. Certainly, some serotypes are more invasive than others, and virulence factors other than capsule also play a role42,43.",

Some ecological studies have found significant associations between peak viral detection and peak pneumococcal disease with a lag of one week to one month, others have found associations without applying a lag8\u201310. We chose to study samples before, during and up to one month after viral infection. We did not find a significant decline in pneumococcal concentrations after RSV or rhinovirus URTIs in Kenyan children when the viral episodes were combined, but we did note that the decline in concentration was significant after RSV episodes if considered alone. It is possible that the effects of viral infection on pneumococcal concentration are different for different viruses, including other viruses that we did not study, such as influenza or human metapneumovirus. However, the fold-change of approximately a half is still small relative to variation in nasopharyngeal pneumococcal concentration within and between individuals.",

In a non-linear system it is possible that a modest rise in pneumococcal concentration due to viral URTI would increase the risk of transmission or of invasion. However, this would only occur if the range of concentrations observed in nature were coincident with the point of greatest dynamic range in the risk function. Without further information on the risk functions with pneumococcal concentration, it is difficult to argue that the relatively small changes in concentration observed in temporal association with viral URTI are important mediators of transmission or of invasive risk. This does not disprove that viral infections are on the causal pathway of pneumococcal disease but rather implies that the link between viral URTI and pneumococcal disease may not be as simple as an increase in pneumococcal density.",
