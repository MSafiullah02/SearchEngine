            "text": "The abilities of hybridization probes to detect all human adenovirus types and to identify enteric adenovirus types were evaluated. The efficiency of hybridization was compared to other tests currently in routine laboratory use on clinical specimens from young children with gastroenteritis. Probes were derived from various regions of the adenovirus types 2 and 41 genomes, and were evaluated by hybridization with a series of DNA quantities from 1 Fg to 10 pg of one adenovirus type from each human subgenus, lambda phage, and HEp 2 cells. The sensitivity of hybridization with the HPll probe (92.7%), containing the conserved hexon gene, compared well with EM (54.6%), culture and neutralization (45.5%), and enzyme immunoassay (61.8%). The sensitivity of detection of enteric adenovirus isolates by the cloned BgllI D fragment probe (92.9%) and by a synthetic probe (85.7%), manufactured from type-specific sequences of the Ad41 hexon gene were comparable to Ad40/Ad41 specific enzyme immunoassay (84.6%). Hybridization was found to be a sensitive method of adenovirus detection in comparison to traditional methods of laboratory diagnosis. Synthetic oligonucleotides enable specific detection of individual enteric adenovirus types. Hybridization had additional advantages over other tests in identifying cases of infection with more than one adenovirus type and in allowing an estimate of the concentration of adenovirus in the specimen. 0 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

Adenoviruses have been found consistently in the stools of apparently healthy children during surveillance programs [Fox et al., 1977; Rodriguez et al., 19851. The ubiquity of adenoviruses makes it difficult to establish criteria to define adenoviral agents of gastroenteritis and prevents unequivocal substantiation of adenoviral causation of diarrhoea [Madeley, 19831 . The problem is compounded by differences in pathogenicity and cultivability between adenovirus types. The readily grown, lower numbered adenovirus types can be carried asymptomatically [Fox et al., 1977; Kidd et al., 1982; Rodriguez et al., 19851 , while isolates of the enteric adenovirus types 40 and 41 that cause the majority of clinical disease [Uhnoo et al., 1984; Wigand et al., 19831 have fastidious growth characteristics and tend to escape identification. Additionally, enteric adenoviruses present in dual infections are frequently not observed [Brown, 19851. Adenoviruses of a different type or viruses of most other groups tend to overgrow enteric adenoviruses in culture, even when present at a lower concentration [Brown, 19901 , and fastidious adenoviruses are underdiagnosed.",

In this study we examined cloned and synthesized sequences for the detection of all adenovirus types and for the specific identificationof enteric types by hybridization.

Viruses were cultured, purified on CsCl density gradients, and extracted as previously described [Scott-Taylor and Hammond, 19921 . Fragments of the adenovirus genome Ad41 strain Tak were amplified in competent E . coli strain Jm109 in plasmid pGem 32 (Promega Biotech, Mississauga, Ontario) . EcoRI fragments A, B, and C were cloned in plasmids p41EAC (containing both A and C fragments), p41EA, p41EB, and p41EC. Ad41 hexon gene sequences were electroeluted from p41EA after digestion with SalI and HindIII. An attempt was also made to isolate the type-specific hexon gene sequences by cloning Hind11 fragments of the p41EA plasmid in the blunt-ended SmaI site in the pGEM 32 vector. Useful transformants were identified by colony hybridization with the SalID fragment of the Ad41 genome. The BglIID fragment probe was kindly donated by Howard Takiff in the form of a n insert in vector pAT153 [Takiff et al., 19851 . The HPII probe, a HindIII-PuuII fragment enclosing the complete sequence of the Ad2 hexon gene, was evaluated in previous experiments as containing the most conserved adenovirus sequences, which enable this probe to detect all adenovirus subgenera with uniformity [Scott-Taylor et al., 19921 . Adenovirus DNA sequences were analysed with Pustell Sequence Analysis software (IBI, New Haven, CT) on genomic sequences recorded by Genbank. The suitability of oligonucleotide sequences for use as probes was determined with the program Oligo (National Bioscience, Hamel, MN).",

Ten percent stool suspensions were made by emulsification of approximately 1 g/10 ml phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing antibiotics in polypropylene tubes with glass beads over a Vortex mixer. Suspensions were clarified by centrifugation at 3,020 x g (5,000 rpm in a Sorval RT600 centrifuge) for 20 min. EM examination was enhanced by ultracentrifugation of clarified suspensions onto formvar-coated grids by means of an airfuge [Hammond et al., 19811 . Two commercial immunoassay kits were employed for detection of all adenoviruses and for identification of enteric types according to the manufacturer's instructions (Cambridge Bioscience, Worcester, MA). Culture was performed by inoculation of 100 p1 of clarified suspension applied to semiconfluent monolayers of 293 cell, primary RMK and HEp 2 cell lines. Specimens which grew virus in the conventional HEp 2 or RMK cells were further tested with neutralizing antisera (obtained from ATCC) to the 6 lowest numbered species. Non-neutralized virus isolates were identified by restriction analysis. Two monoclonal antibodies specific of other subgroups than the whole Ad41 genomic probe, detecting lower amounts of heterologous subgroup DNA relative to the quantity of Ad41 DNA detected in the same autoradiographic time interval. Various PuuI fragments were electroeluted from the p41EA plasmid to assess the specificity of isolated central sequences of the Ad41 genome as probes. PuuI fragments B, D, E, and F, extending from map units 26 to 48,48 to 59,17 to 21, and 21 to 26, respectively (Fig. 1, RE map) , all demonstrate reactions (Fig. 1, panels iii, iv, v, and vi) comparable to the parent plasmid. Isolation of segments of the EcoRI A fragment by cleavage with PuuI did not demarcate any area able to better distinguish between the DNA of Ad41 and other types. The PuuI F fragment shown in panel vi may be useful as a subgenus F specific probe. This fragment detected Ad41 DNA within one log dilution of the reaction with Ad41 DNA and distinguished between other subgroups by at least 3 log dilutions. PuuI F fragment probe has an approximately equal reactivity with enteric types and would not detect other adenovirus types unless present a t 1,000 times the concentration of Ad41 virions.",

Adenovirus was detected by a t least one conventional test in 55 specimens of the 1,071 stool samples examined. Isolates were identified by neutralization or restriction analysis. All identified enteric isolates had restriction patterns of the Ad41A strain [Scott-Taylor et al., 19901 . The positive samples were spotted in random order among 200 samples on a nylon membrane for hybridization. Suspensions used in prior evaluations of 9 adenovirus positive specimens were spotted to determine whether virus in original suspensions had deteriorated. Samples 81 and 88 were from a single specimen, spotted twice to ensure reproducibility. The 200 spotted samples consisted, therefore, of 55 unique adenovirus positive specimens, 28 of which were assessed as enteric isolates, 10 duplicates, and 135 adenovirus negative specimens. Twelve of the adenovirus negative samples contained rotavirus, 8 grew enteroviruses, and small round virus particles were seen by electron microscopy in 6 and coronavirus in 1 more. The specimens reacting with the various diagnostic Table I in the order spotted on the hybridization membrane. A total of 60 of the samples, including 51 of the unique specimens, reacted with the HPII probe in the first panel of Figure 4 . The BgEII D fragment and synthetic Hex5B probes in the two panels below reacted with 26 and 24 specimens, respectively. The amount of viral DNA in the specimen could be estimated from the dilution series of control DNA below the specimens. The Ad41 genomic DNA probe and plasmid p41EC, containing the Ad41 EcoRI C fragment, hybridized with specimens containing adenoviruses other than enteric types (reactions not shown). Cloned probes p41EC and BgZII D reacted with negative specimens 122,124, and 166. Specimens 27 and 199 reacted strongly with all Ad41 DNA probes, although types Ad2 and Ad5 emerged from culture. These specimens were subsequently tested with the subgenus F-specific EIA and were found to harbour a conventional type as well as a n enteric adenovirus in concurrent infection. A sample of 5 of the 9 uncultivable specimens not identified to type was tested in the blocking assay. Preincubation with the Ad41 monoclonal antibody reduced binding to the capture antibody by between 12% and 37%. The Ad40 antibody had no effect and for the purposes of calculation of test performance all the uncultivable specimens were presumed to contain Ad41. The sensi-tivity and specificity of the diagnostic tests are compared in Table 11 . The 92.7% sensitivity of the HPII probe in hybridization, detecting 51 of 55 unique specimens, compares favourably with conventional diagnostic tests. The specificities of the genomic Ad41 DNA, p41EC, andBgZII D probes were evaluated on the detection of enteric adenovirus types and were reduced by reactions with unrelated adenovirus types or negative specimens. The synthetic DNA probe specificity was evaluated for Ad41 specimens alone. No false positives were attributed to HPII or Hex5B probes. The predictive values of the tests (Table 11) indicate that most hybridization probes had greater reliability in reporting a positive or negative test result than the conventional diagnostic methods.",

Results indicate that hybridization could improve the efficiency of diagnosis of adenovirus infection in gastroenteritis by one and a half times or more over individual methods in routine use. The technique has great flexibility and can utilize cloned or synthetic sequences to diagnose groups or individual types of virus. Oligomeric probes can evidently form effective means of diagnosis, and selection of the appropriate shared or unique sequence can enable differentiation of groups or individual adenovirus types according to the degree of specificity required. The type-specific hexon sequences provide a means to differentiate between closely related adenoviruses by hybridization with DNA probes or neutralisation with antipeptide sera [Toogood et al., 19921 . Hybridization had several additional advantages over other diagnostic methods in enabling the detection of dual infections and allowing an estimate of the concentration of viral particles present in the specimen. Dual infections are probably not uncommon judging from the numbers of specimens that yield more than one adenovirus type upon careful culture [Brandt et al., 1986; Brown, 1985; Kidd et al., 1982; Wigand et al., 19831 , and none of the traditional methods in use are capable of identifying more than one isolate in a specimen.",

The most reactive of the enteric specimens were defined from the control dilution series as present in excess of 100 ng of viral DNA in 150 pl of the 10% stool suspension spotted. Since the Ad41 genome comprises 34,600 base pairs [Scott-Taylor and Hammond, 19921 and has a molecular weight of approximately 23 x lo6, it can be calculated that there are about 2.5 x 10\" molecules of the Ad41 genome per microgram of DNA. Therefore, in the 150 pl of stool suspension, containing 15 mg of stool and 0.1 pg of viral DNA, there are more than 2.5 x lo6 genomes, and there are more than 1.7 x 10l1 virus particles per gram in the most reactive stool specimens. This is in close agreement with the previous evaluation that enteric adenoviruses can be excreted in excess of 10l1 particles per gram of stool [Takiff et al., 19811 and demonstrates that hybridization can define viral concentration with some reliability. An association between virus concentration and disease is not clear at present. Examination of the relationship between viral burden and prognosis with this technique could yield significant results. Additionally, evaluation of viral concentration may be helpful in determining a critical level for defining causation of gastroenteritis by certain adenovirus types.",

The reaction of vector DNA with plasmids derived from alimentary flora has previously been observed [Huang and Deibel, 1988; Takiff et al., 19851 . The lack of falsepositive reaction of the HPII probe, however, demonstrates that extensive electroelution can render probes sufficiently free of plasmid DNA contamination for use with faecal specimens. It may be advisable to saturate the probe with unlabelled plasmid DNA to completely eliminate this source of false results in hybridization. The uncultivable specimens tested with the blocking assay were reduced in binding by less than the 50% critical value that identifies a n adenovirus type by the test methods. The low reduction in binding may signify that either these specimens were grossly denatured or that commercially available Ad41 monoclonal antibodies [Herrmann et al., 1987; Wood et al., 19891 are not able to react efficiently with local variant strains of Ad41 specific to Manitoba. The prevalent Ad41 strain in Manitoba was not detected by the first commercial enzyme immunoassay [Scott-Taylor et al., 19901 marketed with monoclonal antibodies developed to the prototype strain Tak of Ad41 [Herrmann et al., 19871.
