            "text": "Historically, the word metagenome was first used in 1998 to describe the collection of microbial genome found in a soil sample, including microorganisms that could not be cultured by conventional methods.1 Early metagenomics studies on environmental samples yielded the identification of metabolic characters, the classification of organisms and the discovery of antibiotics and enzymes.2, 3 Now, metagenomic studies include a broad range of research including marine ecological research, plant and agricultural, human genetics and diagnostics of human diseases. The first application of metagenomic in virus discovery was in the analysis of viruses in soil samples from two marine sites in San Diego.4 Later, the approach was used to analyze viruses in different fields.5 The traditional methods of virus detection involved filtration, tissue culture, electron microscopy, and serology.6 Among these, the standard gold method of virus detection was cell culture. However, many viruses cannot be easily cultivated, and two milestone innovations solved this problem; polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing (Sanger method).6 By using these methods, several important emerging viruses, such as hendra virus,7 nipah virus,8 menangle virus,9, 10 melaka virus,11 and reston ebola virus,12 were discovered. Despite the sensitivity of PCR, it can only detect one virus at a time. Multiplex PCR, on the other hand, is used to identify multiple targets for the identification of more than one virus in a single test. However, it is often difficult to standardize the assay by using various primers. Hence, novel approaches that overcome the difficulties of viral detection with the conventional molecular methods are needed to discover novel human viruses.13 Not surprisingly, virologists were the first to explore the use of sequence\u2010independent, a metagenomic approach using Next Generation Sequencer (NGS) to detect human\u2010associated viruses. The genome of DNA and RNA viruses can be detected directly after extraction from samples through metagenomic sequencing.14\n",

            "text": "Worldwide, respiratory tract infection (RTI) is an important cause of hospitalization among young children and elderly, with significantly high mortality and morbidity.15 RTI is a group of diseases of both upper or lower respiratory tract. Upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) include laryngitis, common cold, rhinitis, pharyngitis/tonsillitis, otitis media and rhinosinusitis/sinusitis. On the other hand, lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) include bronchitis, bronchiolitis, tracheitis and pneumonia. These respiratory tract infections increase the extent of the problem in patients with chronic comorbidities and asthma,16 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),17 very young, elderly,17 and immunocompromized patients. Respiratory viruses account for over 65% of all respiratory infections and 90% of URTIs.18, 19 Bacteria, however, only represent 10% of all URTIs.19 Despite the improvement in the molecular techniques for viral discovery, the viral aetiology of RTI is still unknown in a high number of cases either because the tests are ineffective or the virus is unrelated to any of the currently known respiratory viruses. Current diagnostic methods to detect respiratory viruses are mainly based on sequence\u2010dependent molecular amplification techniques such as PCR, which identify a panel of known viruses, and therefore, new respiratory viruses are missed. To overcome the pitfalls associated with PCR approaches based on NGS techniques such as viral metagenomic will become a logical step as routine viral diagnostics on clinical samples. Broaden not only the detection range of viruses but also provide an additional characterization of the detected viruses such as genotypes and subtypes of viruses. However, the efficiency and viability of using such techniques in diagnostic setting require further study.",

One patient with mixed viral infection presented with severe bronchopneumonia while the rest of the patients had mild respiratory symptoms. These results suggested the absence of an association between multiple viral infections and the severity of the respiratory disease. In contrast to our results, studies showed that patients with respiratory tract infection due to dual viral infections were hospitalized significantly more often than those with respiratory disease due to a single virus.25, 26 In agreement with our results, others did not demonstrate any correlation between the presence of multiple viruses and the severity of the respiratory diseases.27, 28, 29, 30\n",

They come from food, water, or dust and eventually become be part of normal flora of the upper respiratory tract which may/or may not be linked to any disease. Another prominent observation was the detection of sequences from a human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) approximately half of the patients. This observation reveals the high prevalence of human endogenous retrovirus in the population of Kuwait. According to many investigations, it was found that human endogenous viruses are old viruses that started to integrate into the human genome around 30\u201040 million years ago and now about 8% of the human genome is derived from sequences with similarity to retroviruses.42\n",

The comparison of the metagenomic sequencing data to RT\u2010Real time PCR data revealed absolute agreement of 47.7%. Although metagenomic approach failed to detect all the multiplex PCR positive samples, it did offer several advantages over the multiplex Real\u2010Time PCR method. For examples, the metagenomic sequencing identified several viruses causing respiratory infections that are usually not detected using routine diagnostic assays (eg, torqueteno viruses and coronavirus HKU14). Also, it delivered more detailed typing information for the detected viruses including subtype for some viruses. Furthermore, it is possible that multiplex RT\u2010PCR amplifies viruses present in minimal concentrations that have no significance in the disease process. It should be noted that two nucleic acid extracts for each clinical sample were prepared. The first extract was used to perform RT\u2010PCR and the second extract was used to perform metagenomics sequencing using NGS. This, in turn, will generate differences in nucleic acid concentration and quality which may further affect the results.",

            "text": "The analytical sensitivity of metagenomics sequencing is highly influenced by the quality of the samples. To improve the sensitivity of this approach is by increasing the depth of sequencing, which in turn can be overcome by improving the sample preparation.43 One of the solutions is to perform additional steps of ample\u2010filtering before sequencing to eliminate host cells and enhance the microbial genome to ensure more efficient microbial pathogen detection. Some studies employed a pre\u2010treatment step before nucleic acid extraction which required a combination of filtration and density\u2010dependent centrifugation to enhance the majority of viruses.4, 44, 45 Others used an enzyme cocktail containing DNasI, RNaseI, and benzonase to digest naked host nucleic acid.46 One of the limitations of pre\u2010treatment step to remove host DNA contents from clinical samples is the possibility to introduce a bias and decrease the sensitivity for DNA viruses such as adenovirus which considered as vital virus causing respiratory diseases. Also, filtering steps may reduce significantly the quality of DNA/RNA produced, which may further effect metagenomics sequencing results. Therefore, it is recommended to keep pre\u2010treatment steps to a minimum to avoid any particular bias. We have used a virus identification algorithm, BWA and BLAST from NCBI for the identification, clustering and read removal. One noticeable step for future improvement lies in the treatment of the BLAST undefined reads. BLAST search did not classify a large portion of the sequence data generated here. Future efforts will include an emphasis on alternative virus identification to characterize these novel sequences.",

In NGS library assembly protocols, it is essential to have one or multiple PCR amplification steps that could elevate the concentrations of DNA, thereby increasing the risk of contamination. Also, cross\u2010contamination of starting material is a devastating issue. There is a chance that samples may contaminate each other when they are prepared at the same time, or multiple libraries are produced in parallel. To avoid this type of contamination is to perform all sample and library preparations individually. If it is not feasible to do all sample and library preps separately, then strict measures are needed to be employed to keep samples pure. Certainly, it is essential to identify at which steps of the experimental protocol the contaminations are most often happening, and to deliver guidelines on how to avoid it.",

The results presented in this study demonstrated that metagenomic approach is a promising diagnostic tool in clinical virology in which RT\u2010Real\u2010Time PCR couldn't detect many respiratory viruses that were detected by metagenomic approaches. Such sequence independent detection method will increase the chance to detect the causative agent of viral RTI and to gain information of the viruses that cannot be obtained by the current diagnostic tool. Although many obstacles to the routine use of metagenomic approaches do exist, which include cost, labor intensity and turnover time, it was proved to be highly sensitive in many studies, and it theoretically provides more information regarding virus species/type for virus diagnosis with the ability of the detection of unknown viruses. The question is probably when metagenomics sequencing will become a routine test for detecting infectious viruses? This approach requires improvement in sample preparation, validated pipelines for read sorting and taxonomic assignation and soon will substitute the current diagnostic tools. Indeed, this novel study provided outstanding information on the association of different viruses with RTIs in Kuwait. Moreover, metagenomics queening approach will be used in the near future to study the viral diversity in other syndromes such as pyrexia of unknown origin and gastroenteritis.",
