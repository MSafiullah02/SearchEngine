Populations of the red fox are well established in peri-urban and urban areas, so they represent a potential reservoir of viruses that transmit from wildlife to humans or domestic animals. Foxes and dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) often share the same viral pathogens such as canine parvovirus 2, canine enteric coronavirus, rotavirus and canine distemper [1]. The most important is rabies, which was endemic in Croatia since 1977, but today almost eradicated thanks to the ongoing vaccination campaigns using oral rabies vaccine to target the red fox population in Croatia [2]. Fox carcasses, collected regularly to access the effectiveness or vaccination, can also be used for various laboratory investigations.",

From our metagenomic study, the full-length fox circovirus genomic sequence was de novo assembled from the clean reads into a single contig. Two other viral genomes (picobirnavirus and parvovirus) were partially assembled from the reads and mapped to the reference genomes. Based on the number of viral reads, circovirus was the most represented virus in juvenile and picobirnavirus in adult foxes. Juvenile foxes showed the smaller overall number of eukaryotic virus reads in comparison to bacteriophage reads while pooled samples from adults had greater number and diversity of eukaryotic viruses. It might be the case that the adult foxes have been exposed to a variety of viruses and other microorganisms over their lifetime, and therefore have developed specific intestinal viral flora in comparison to juvenile ones with obviously dominant normal intestinal bacterial flora. Compared to results of Bodewes et al. [3] other prevalent fox faecal viruses (fox hepevirus and fox astroviruses) were not discovered. Preparation of samples from frozen carcasses cannot be the cause since it was identical as in study of Bodewes et al. [3]. To corroborate this fact, we also detected + ss-RNA viruses but they were mainly attributed to plant viruses. One of the reasons might be the difference in the library preparation and the other one simply the geographical origin.",

Recently, there were many new circoviruses identified in animal and human faeces and environmental samples but their natural hosts are mainly unidentified [17], [18]. Circovirus sequences were found in three samples but the highest number of reads was detected in a sample from adult foxes. From that sample (55590) a single de novo assembled genome-sized contig was generated from even 1412 specific reads. Some previous results show that full-length viral genomic sequences cannot be assembled from the clean reads due to the low quantity of the virus within samples, the short reads, and the lack of known reference sequences [19], [20]. Phylogenetic analysis of circoviral nt sequences (Fig. 2) and sequence analysis of the rep and cap protein showed that our sequence clustered with recently identified canine circoviruses [14], [15], [16] and newly described circoviruses from sera of foxes with neurologic disease [21]. Our results demonstrate that new canine circovirus that has been proved to be pathogenic for foxes [21] and dogs [14], [15], [16] can be found in asymptomatic foxes too. Forty-seven per cent of all viral reads in the sample discussed here were assigned with canine circovirus. Such a high number of viral reads obtained by viral metagenomic approach using random primers for cDNA synthesis could be attributed to unknown subclinical or clinical disease. The first available data on clinico-pathological signs and prevalence of circoviruses in foxes published recently suggested that the prevalence of circoviruses in foxes is relatively high [21]. Future studies should investigate whether a new circovirus is main pathogen or act in co-infection with an unknown agent. We did not detected other prevalent canine viruses such as canine parvovirus 2, canine enteric coronavirus, canine rotavirus and canine distemper which is reported in both domestic and wild carnivores in many European countries [1].",

From the same sample where complete new circovirus was assembled (sample 55590) the complete RdRp sequence was generated by mapping to reference genomes. Phylogenetic analysis of our picobirnavirus nt (Fig. 3) and aa (not shown) RdRp gene sequence showed that obtained sequence was more closely related to the porcine and human picobirnaviruses than to recently described fox picobirnavirus [3].
