            "text": "As lockdowns and stay-at-home orders start to be lifted across the globe, governments are struggling to establish effective and practical guidelines to reopen their economies. In dense urban environments with people returning to work and public transportation resuming full capacity, enforcing strict social distancing measures will be extremely challenging, if not practically impossible. Governments are thus paying close attention to particular locations that may become the next cluster of disease spreading. Indeed, certain places, like some people, can be \"super-spreaders.\" Is a bustling train station in a central business district more or less susceptible and vulnerable as compared to teeming bus interchanges in the suburbs? Here, we propose a quantitative and systematic framework to identify spatial super-spreaders and the novel concept of super-susceptibles, i.e. respectively, places most likely to contribute to disease spread or to people contracting it. Our proposed data-analytic framework is based on the daily-aggregated ridership data of public transport in Singapore. By constructing the directed and weighted human movement networks and integrating human flow intensity with two neighborhood diversity metrics, we are able to pinpoint super-spreader and super-susceptible locations. Our results reveal that most super-spreaders are also super-susceptibles and that counterintuitively, busy peripheral bus interchanges are riskier places than crowded central train stations. Our analysis is based on data from Singapore, but can be readily adapted and extended for any other major urban center. It therefore serves as a useful framework for devising targeted and cost-effective preventive measures for urban planning and epidemiological preparedness. arXiv:2005.05063v1 [physics.soc-ph] 11 May 2020 refer to these public guidelines as compared to 'social distancing'. Indeed, the main idea is to increase the physical distance between individuals regardless of their possible social connections. This point stresses the key issue of infectious disease spreading in high-density environments, such as most of the Chinese cities, as well as the cities/countries hit by the first wave of Covid-19.",

            "text": "The concept of 'super-spreader' has become an important element in network science 12 , in particular when applied to contagious processes and not necessarily just associated with viral contagions, e.g. in social network studies [13] [14] [15] [16] . The 20/80 rule has been observed in many disease spreading studies, and reflecting the fact that about 20% of the people are responsible for approximately 80% spread of an infectious disease; this population is referred to as super-spreaders 17, 18 . Given this 20/80 rule, it appears clearly that identifying super-spreaders is of great theoretical significance as well as high practical importance in terms of disease control. It has therefore attracted significant attention from the research community and the public sector. Previous studies focused on social networks 19, 20 -with nodes representing individuals and links/edges corresponding to their social interactions-to search for the most influential people according to some particular network metrics-e.g. degree, closeness, betweenness centralities, k-shell decomposition, etc 14, 16, [21] [22] [23] [24] . In recent studies, researchers have uncovered that the characteristics of neighboring nodes (i.e. the semi-local information or its local structure) strongly influence the nodes' spreading capability [25] [26] [27] . In addition, some studies have shown that when super-spreaders-as identified through local or semi-local measurements and metrics-belong to the same local community, their spreading effectiveness maybe high within that community but can be seriously hindered at the global network level. Thus, some methods have been developed to perform community detection while also identifying the top-k super-spreaders 23, 28 . In summary, previous studies concluded that two particular node characteristics are key to quantifying their influential power and super-spreader potential: (1) the node's local information-i.e. the immediate interaction with its neighboring nodes, and (2) the node's community and how it is itself connected to the rest of the network. Those studies integrated both local and semi-local network metrics in order to identify super-spreaders from social networks 15, 26 .",

            "text": "As highlighted previously, the concept of super-spreader focuses on person-based social interactions. However, when considering large-scale human analyses, such as those in country-wide or city-wide studies, this concept of super-spreader faces some serious practical challenges owing to inherent need of massive amount of data related to person-to-person interactions and co-presence activity. To overcome this critical challenge associated with social and co-presence networks, researchers have introduced a particular class of spatial networks to conceptualize the interactions between physical places 29 , thereby enabling to analyze and gain insight into the influence of particular spaces and locations on disease spreading 30-33 . Indeed, people constantly move from place to place during their daily activity, and these movements offer the opportunity for infectious diseases to spreading as viruses or pathogens could be transmitted from individual to individual 34-36 . It is worth adding that the urban structure has been used to rank the concentration of human activity and population density 37-39 . To incorporate human movement, individual interactions and models of disease spreading-e.g. susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered or SEIR model-previous studies applied the metapopulation model to simulate the disease diffusion dynamic process 31, 32, 40 . In summary, spatial networks can be useful in uncovering the spatial structures behind disease diffusion networks, and provide decision-making supports for country-wide or city-wide prevention measures. The vast majority of previous spatial network studies on disease diffusion focused on the space-time development and potential impacts of the disease. However, to the best of our knowledge, no attention has been paid to studying the impact of the most 'influential' geographical spaces among these spatial networks. Here, the adjective 'influential' refers to the particular role in the network sense, played by those spaces within the considered spatial networks. Similar to the concept of super-spreaders in social networks, the concept of super-spreader in spatial human movement networks indicates that owing to the inhomogeneous population flow, some places (i.e. nodes of the spatial network) would experience higher flow intensities than some other places, thus influencing the distribution in the capability to spread a contagious disease to a larger extent in a shorter time period.",

In other words, by identifying super-susceptible locations, we aim finding the most susceptible nodes within the spatial human movement network. One similar concept in spatial analysis is the low-high outliers, that is any location with low density of disease cases which is surrounded by high density locations, thereby making it more vulnerable as it has a higher probability to report a higher number of cases in the following time period 44 . In the field of network science, the concepts of 'spreaders' and 'receivers' first appeared in the Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search (HITS) algorithm 45 as hubs and authorities, respectively. In the HITS algorithm, hubs describe highly influential nodes, while authorities represent highly popular destination nodes. To sum-up, the spatial super-susceptibles correspond to the susceptible locations in a spatial diffusion network. These locations are identified as being more vulnerable within the network as they are the destination of more people, hence generating a higher probability of being visited by infected agents.",

            "text": "The ongoing outbreak of the infectious Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19, also known as nCoV-2019 and caused by the pathogen SARS-CoV-2) is progressing worldwide with a reported number of cases surpassing 3 million 1 as of April 29, 2020 . The pathology of Covid-19 and its global spread remain a critical challenge to all worldwide 2, 3 . As of this writing, no approved treatment for Covid-19 has been identified and a vaccine is expected to be 12 months to 18 months away from being widely available. Based on our current medical knowledge, Covid-19 is more infectious than the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS is caused by SARS-CoV-1) 4, 5 , and with the main transmission pathway being through respiratory droplets, with infected patients experiencing an incubation period of maximum 14 days (possibly longer in some reported cases) before exhibiting a set of flu-like symptoms 6, 7 . The asymptomatic latent period of Covid-19 and its highly contagious nature have made the spread of Covid-19 extremely difficult to control and prevent 5 . The outbreak of Covid-19 started in December 2019 in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province of China. Following the domestic outbreak in mainland China, the disease started spreading worldwide in January 2020 (or even as early as December 2020), leading to a declaration of Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) by the World Health Organization (WHO) 8 . Until this declaration of PHEIC, a total of 7, 818 cases were confirmed, in which 82 only were cases outside China 8 . In February 2020, Covid-19 continued spreading internationally, primarily in East and Southeast Asia, as well as some European countries having extensive air-travel routes to Wuhan and China. The first wave of international spreading took place during the critical period of the Chinese New Year holiday, during which China experiences the largest human migration every year 9 . Countries that were first hit by this outbreak include Thailand, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, France, Germany and the United Kingdom 10 . Those imported cases have quickly turned into local transmissions in most of these countries. In March 2020, as the outbreak reached an exponential growth in Italy, Spain, France, and Germany, the epicenter of Covid-19 moved to Europe 11 , which became the second wave of this outbreak and international pandemic. That second wave triggered a near-complete lockdown in most of the largest European countries. The purpose of these country-level or city-level lockdowns was to introduce and enforce strict social distancing measures, that were hoped to bring a fast reduction in the spread of imported and local community transmissions. The central assumption behind these drastic public-health measures was that restricting human movement is key to controlling the spread of Covid-19 in communities, between cities and countries. 'Physical distancing' has been coined as a better term to super-susceptible, it would require particular attention since it would pose the risk of simultaneously being a hotbed of infection and disease spreader. Identifying these places would therefore be critical in the fight with infectious diseases such as In this article, we report a study aimed at systematically identifying the spatial super-spreaders and spatial super-susceptibles in the spatial human network of the city-state of the Republic of Singapore. The particular choice of Singapore stems from it having: (1) been hit early in the first wave of infection directly from Wuhan and with a systematic tracking and mapping of infected people 46 , (2) one of the highest population densities in Southeast Asia, (3) a dense and highly interconnected human mobility and transportation networks 38, 47 , and (4) detailed and reliable data for the construction of spatial networks 48 . As mentioned earlier, a spatial super-spreader is a locus with a high outflow of people-i.e. a place where a lot of people are originated from and those people are moving to a high variety of places. In the same vein, a spatial super-susceptible is a destination for a large number of individuals originating from different places. Hence, this work proposes a systematic data-centric framework enabling the identification of spatial locations, which should be targeted by public health agencies in the event of an epidemic such as Covid-19. With these critical places identified, policy makers would then be able to implement cost-effective targeted responses with prevention and intervention measures directly connected to the level of vulnerability of a given location.",

The city-state primarily occupies an island located in Southeast Asia with a total surface area of about 724.2 km 2 . As of 2019, the total population of Singapore is about 5.703 million people (with a population density of about 7, 875.68 per km 2 ), in which 70.6% are residents (citizens and permanent residents) and 29.4% are non-residents (foreigners with long-term passes). According to the General Household Survey 2015 49 , about 62.7% students and 64.1% working person relies on bus or rail transport services to travel to schools or work places, thereby making public transportation the primary mode of transportation in Singapore. As a result, the density of people using the public transports during the morning and evening peaks are high, and the distance between people at the stations and vehicles is short. Hence, a direct consequence of the high population density combined with a high rate of people using public transportation is that physical distancing is extremely challenging if not impossible during regular operations. This issue is a serious concern when facing the spreading of a highly contagious disease such as Covid-19.",

There are five regions (Central, West, North, North East, and East), with 55 planning areas, and 323 subzones 50 .

Both indexes SUI and SPI are quantitatively determined and calculated using two key elements: (1) the local strength of human in-and outflows, and (2) the diversity of their respective neighborhoods 15 . The local strength of in-and outflows for a given location is the number of people coming to or leaving from the location, i.e. respectively the weighted in-degree and weighted out-degree of the corresponding node. The neighborhood diversity is captured and quantified by two types of concepts: (1) the diversity of zones and (2) the diversity of coreness. The diversity of zones 38, 51 refers to people that are coming from different parts of the city. As for the diversity of coreness 52, 53 , it refers to people either coming from the core or from the periphery of the country. More details about what constitutes core and periphery is given in Step 3 below. We applied this analysis framework to the Singapore public transport flow network, and identified the SSP and SSS using the SUI and SPI indexes. The population flow patterns are expected to be different for weekdays and weekends. Thus, the flow data were separated into weekday and weekend ones. The calculation flow of the spatial spreader and spatial susceptible indexes is detailed in Fig. 2 . The first part consists in aggregating the bus and train OD flow data to subzones as mentioned earlier. That top layer provides the main data for the calculation, i.e. two weighted and directed networks: weekday and weekend flow networks. These networks are subsequently used to compute three network characteristic measurements, including degree centrality (Step 1), community detection (Step 2), and k-shell decomposition (Step 3), which are described in full details in the following subsections. The degree centrality is used as a proxy for the intensity of the local out-and inflows, whereas the community detection and k-shell decomposition results enable the computation of neighborhood diversity, including zone-entropy and coreness-entropy as introduced below. Finally, in the last step (Step 4), the three network characteristics are used to calculate the SUI and SPI.",

However, the exact indices are largely modified to account for the specificities of our study. Specifically, the SPI and SUI calculations are based on a geometric average of three key network metrics. The SPI (see Eq. (8)) is the geometric average of the local normalized weighted out-degree (NWOutDegree(i)), the zone-entropy of outgoing neighbors (H zone OutNeigh (i)), and the out-coreness-entropy of the outgoing neighbors (H core OutNeigh (i)). To understand this particular definition, one may for instance consider the case for which a node's SPI is high: this node has a high volume of outgoing flows (high local intensity), half of the flows are directed to the core area and the other half to the non-core area (periphery); these flows are equally divided into different zones (high out-neighbors' zone-entropy). In other words, a high SPI subzone has a large number of travelers originating from there, and these individuals are on their way to both core and periphery places, which are located in various zones. Therefore, with such a high SPI index value, the disease spreading would be facilitated within a short period of time. The flow intensity and diversity measurements are all normalized in the unit interval, and consequently the geometric average also varies between zero and one.",

Again, the concept associated with the SUI is better understood when considering a subzone with large incoming flows: half of the flows are coming from the core area and the other half from the non-core area, and these flows are equally coming from different zones. In other words, this subzone is a destination for a large number of travelers originating from various zones and their origins of movement contain both core and periphery areas. Therefore, a high SUI subzone is 6/19 expected to be a place where travelers would be more vulnerable and sensitive to being infected. Like the SPI, the SUI varies in the unit interval.",

It appears that the patterns for the non-weighted and weighted in-degrees (top row) are similar to those of their out-degree counterparts (bottom row).

For the non-weighted degree measurements (left column), the high in-and out-degree subzones appear to be mainly concentrated at the East, North East and Central regions, whereas the West and North have a higher number of lower degree subzones. These results are correlated with the distribution of human density in Singapore, namely high to very high in the East, North East and Central regions, and lower in the West and North of the island.

Figure 5 shows the spatial distribution of communities for both weekdays and weekends. The MapEquation algorithm with the provided data reveals 17 different communities for both weekday flow network and weekend flow network. Most communities are spatially continuous as the flow data is integrated with the inverse of the distance. However, some exceptions exist in both weekday and weekend communities (e.g. weekday and weekend community #2). The spatially-continuous patterns are expected given the spatial embedding of our networks and it indicates, as expected, that interactions between closer subzones are effectively stronger. On the other hand, the few spatially-split communities appear to be the by-product of a strong flow of human movement between two spatially-distant locations with sparser spaces between them. Although weekday communities and weekend ones are different-some are split and others have different boundariesoverall, they show some notable similarities (e.g. weekday community #11 and weekend community #10). This observation can be attributed to two particular features of Singapore: (1) given the limited available land, Singapore has a dense and compact urban landscape with a high level of mixed-use areas, be them residential, industrial and/or commercial, (2) a non-negligible fraction of the working population is active on Saturdays, which creates a high flow of travelers with the same commuting patterns as during weekdays. For instance, in the Western region, weekday communities #4 and #16 are extremely similar with weekend communities #3 and #17. These particular communities are fairly large with a heavy mixed-use of residential and industrial areas, where people have similar daily activities within a week. The North East Region (NER) contains three similar communities during weekdays and weekends (community #2 (upper part), #14, and part of #11 during weekdays, and the similar patterns of # 2 (upper part), #13, and #10 during weekends). The North Region (NR) is split into multiple communities (community # 2 (lower part), #7, #8, #10, #11, #15 during weekdays, and # 2 (lower part), #7, #9, #10, #15 during weekends). The identified communities #1, #2, #5, #6, #9, #12 during weekdays, and communities #1, #2, #5, #11, #16 during weekends are similar and fit well with the Central Region (CR), which is the central business district of Singapore. The community detection results show that the boundaries of human activity can be changed between weekdays and weekends. Community #4 in weekends appears to be an area resulting from the merger of communities #5, #17 and part of #8 during weekdays. This indicates that the area has stronger human movement interactions during weekends than weekdays, probably because the area is mostly residential with few shopping places providing daily needs products and necessities. In summary, the human movement boundaries are not fixed to a static pattern, and it is usually smaller than the shape of the known regional/administrative boundaries.",

The CBD of Singapore is located at the southern central part of the Central Region. High intensity of human activity exists within the CBD area. As shown in Fig.7 , most of the subzones in the CBD have either a low weighted degree or a low neighborhood coreness-entropy. The low weighted degree probably finds its origin in the smallness of the area itself, which limits the catchment of incoming and outgoing flows. As for the low coreness-entropy, we trace it to the fact that a majority of the people are circulating within the CBD, which are mainly composed by the core area (Fig. 6 ). This result indicates that the CBD workplaces are less influential in terms of quickly spreading the disease to the rest of the city/island, but a contagious disease would quickly spread inside the CBD area as a consequence of its strong internal flows. In summary, the key influential areas are clearly identified as being the regional transport hubs, which connect the residential areas with the rest of the country.",

Based on the results, the places with intense flows have higher potential to be both SSP and SSS, and this is captured by the directed nature of the networks and the incorporation of the weighted in-degree or out-degree in our calculations. It is worth noting that Our results are in good agreement with previous studies based on the k-shell decomposition method: the core nodes of a social group tend to be, in general, the most influential ones 14, 22 .",

The diversity of neighborhood is especially important while identifying multiple super-spreaders from a network 15, 28 . The zone-entropy is used to measure if the outgoing flows are directed towards more zones within the city-state. For instance, if the outgoing flows from a given place are converging to one zone only, this place can only affect one of the zones among all throughout Singapore, thus its influential power is clearly weak. Conversely, if human movement originating from one place flows to many zones across the country, its influential power is relatively high. In addition, coreness-entropy captures the diversity of flows to or from core or periphery areas. If the flows are all directed towards one of the periphery or core, its influential power is somehow limited to this particular type of areas. Conversely, if human movement flows to both core and periphery areas, this clearly indicates that whenever an outbreak happens at this place, it could quickly affect and spread to both core and periphery areas. These two diversity metrics complement one another and are combined in the calculation framework for differentiating places with high density of flows into strong and weak influential places (see Materials & Methods).",

In summary, the identified subzones are found to be mainly in the core area of residential and transportation hubs. These places have high population density and activity, such as transportation hubs or community hubs. Therefore, these places should be targeted by public health agencies, with higher resource allocations and disease monitoring aimed at prevention and intervention purposes. For example, public health agencies could consider these locations while planning to setup body temperature checkpoints, or to provide personal hygiene toolkits, or also setting up advertisements related to appropriate behaviors to counteract the ongoing epidemics. Moreover, since these locations are more vulnerable and more influential, they should get more attention while setting up differentiated policies such as the temporary closure of some businesses or restrictions on large-scale human activities as opposed to a blanket lockdown across the country.",
