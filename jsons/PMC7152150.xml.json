Tobacco smoking is the largest environmental risk factor in the United States. In other countries, occupational dust exposures, outdoor air pollution, and poor indoor air quality from burning biomass fuels are major COPD risk factors.10 Among immune-competent adults, increased airway bacteria produce airway inflammation and accelerate airway obstruction.11 Immunosuppression is an independent risk factor for COPD. Immunoglobulin (Ig)A-deficient individuals have repeated lower respiratory tract infections during childhood and poor adult lung function.12 Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection promotes chronic pulmonary inflammation and increased pulmonary matrix metalloprotease expression, leading to smoking-related emphysema.13, 14 Even after effective antiretroviral therapy, patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) have an increased frequency of pulmonary infection and accelerated lung function decline.15, 16 Genetic susceptibility is another risk factor for developing COPD. Mutation of the \u03b11-antitrypsin gene leads to low serum antiprotease activity, causing a much higher risk for COPD in smokers and workers exposed to particulate matter.17 Homozygous \u03b11-antitrypsin deficiency (PI*ZZ) occurs in 1% to 4.5% of COPD patients, and the heterozygous form (PI*MZ), with less severe deficiency, occurs in 17.8% of COPD patients.18 Ethnic origin is an important risk factor for COPD, raising the possibility of differential group-level genetic susceptibility to lung injury.19 For most individuals, predisposition to abnormal lung function is polygenic, with more than 20 risk genes currently identified.20, 21 Poor socioeconomic status, chronic asthma, fetal growth retardation, poor nourishment, and history of pulmonary tuberculosis are other risk factors for COPD.19, 22, 23, 24\n",

These symptoms are associated with accelerated decline in lung function, which may continue despite smoking cessation. The dyspnea usually starts during exercise but can occur with minimal exertion or at rest as disease progresses. Cough and sputum production are usually intermittent and more pronounced in the morning. Other chronic pulmonary diseases with similar clinical presentation and acute exacerbations should be differentiated from those of COPD because treatment differs. Examples of these include asthma, cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, diffuse panbronchiolitis, and obliterative bronchiolitis. Worsening symptoms, increased sputum volume, and transition of sputum color from clear to green or yellow suggests an acute exacerbation, which more commonly occurs during the winter.26 The main differential diagnosis of exacerbations in patients with COPD includes pneumonia and congestive heart failure, both of which are common comorbidities in these patients.4\n",

They usually require increased rescue \u03b2-agonist inhaler use to control symptoms.36 One widely used scale to diagnose the presence and severity of AECOPD requires patients to have at least one of the following clinical presentations: upper respiratory tract infection symptoms within the previous 7 days, increased wheezing, fever without another identified cause, or an increase in heart rate or respiratory rate greater than 20% from baseline. This scale then categorizes patients into three groups based on whether they have worsening dyspnea, increase in sputum purulence, and/or increase in sputum volume. A severe exacerbation has all three criteria, a moderate exacerbation has two, and a mild exacerbation has only one.37 Risk factors associated with COPD exacerbations include having three or more COPD exacerbations in the previous year, reduced FEV1, smoking, and nonadherence with oxygen therapy.38, 39 The risk for severe exacerbation depends on each patient's medical history, including baseline FEV1, number of prior exacerbations, prior need for mechanical ventilation, and comorbidities. Whereas the vast majority of AECOPD can be managed in the outpatient setting, the presence of high severity should prompt consideration of hospital admission.4 The clinical signs of risk for respiratory failure are the most important measure of the current exacerbation's severity. Tachypnea (especially with a respiratory rate above 25 breaths/min), tachycardia, inability to speak full sentences, and fatigue are indications for hospitalization. Oxygen saturation above 90% can be misleading because hypoxemia is frequently a late event in the progression to respiratory failure. In an acutely symptomatic patient, arterial blood gas analysis is more useful than oximetry because it can diagnose hypercapnia as well as hypoxemia. Use of accessory muscles with paradoxical breathing characterized by inward motion of the abdomen during inspiration indicates diaphragmatic fatigue and impending respiratory failure. Abdominal paradoxical breathing, progressive hypercapnia, or deteriorating mental status usually indicates the need for ventilatory support in an intensive care unit with noninvasive or invasive positive-pressure ventilation.4\n",

In spite of increased numbers, alveolar macrophages have impaired phagocytosis, reducing their ability to clear bacteria from the lower airway and thereby causing further inflammation and oxidative stress.57, 58, 59, 60 Neutrophils are also recruited and activated by nonresolving pulmonary inflammation, particularly during exacerbations. Neutrophil elastase and metalloproteinases lead to lung parenchyma destruction. Neutrophil elastase is also a potent mucous secretagogue leading to mucous gland hyperplasia.61 Because neutrophils have a short tissue life span, the airway neutrophilia observed in COPD requires continuous neutrophil recruitment.62 Smoking also impairs neutrophil phagocytic function.63 Collectins, pentraxins, and complement also are deficient,64 further impairing mucosal immunity and predisposing to lower respiratory tract infections.",

            "text": "In stable COPD, the rates of positive routine bacterial cultures of sputum vary between 22% and 83%.91, 92, 93 However, interpreting sputum culture is difficult owing to upper airway contamination, which reduces specificity, and failure to grow fastidious bacteria from the complex lower airway microbiome, which reduces sensitivity. In stable COPD, nonpotential pathogenic microorganisms are isolated much more frequently than potential pathogenic microorganisms.91 Nonpotential pathogenic microorganisms are usually oropharyngeal microbes such as Corynebacterium spp., Neisseria spp., Enterococcus spp., coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus viridans, and fungi such as Candida spp.91 The most commonly isolated potential pathogenic microorganisms are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis.\n52, 91, 94 Culture-independent technologies that assay microbial nucleic acids and antigens often have found potential pathogens in culture-negative respiratory specimens.95, 96 For example, one third of stable COPD patients have Haemophilus influenzae within airway epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages.97 High-throughput sequencing of microbial 16S rRNA genes yields relatively unbiased estimates of the relative abundance of uncultivable and cultivable bacteria.98, 99 The lower airways of normal individuals harbor low levels of oral bacteria such as Prevotella spp. and Veillonella spp.100, 101 Culture-independent techniques have challenged the dogma that the lower airway is normally sterile and provide evidence that there are residential organisms, especially in individuals with already damaged lungs. Oral anaerobes likely modulate the pulmonary immune response in health and disease. This possibility is supported by a growing body of data linking periodontitis, COPD exacerbations, and reduced lung function.102 However, the technical challenges produced by contamination of lower airway samples with upper airway secretions needs to be resolved to better understand the role of airway microbiome in COPD pathogenesis.",

Although for sicker patients nebulized bronchodilators are routinely used in the hospital, data suggest similar bronchodilator effects with metered-dose inhalers.132 A 10- to 14-day course of systemic corticosteroids reduces treatment failure by 46% during both inpatient and outpatient management of COPD exacerbations.133 Systemic corticosteroids are preferred during an exacerbation because they reduce recovery time, improve lung function, and increase arterial oxygenation.134, 135, 136, 137, 138 Systemic corticosteroids also reduce the rate of early relapse and length of hospital stay. Although there are no data to support a specific dose or route of administration for corticosteroids, the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines recommend 30 to 40 mg of oral prednisolone per day for 10 to 14 days.4, 138, 139, 140\n",

            "text": "Early antibiotic treatment of AECOPD in both the outpatient and inpatient settings has become nearly routine in clinical practice even though the role of bacteria in many cases of AECOPD is uncertain. The choice of antibiotic has changed during the past several decades, in part reflecting the changing resistance patterns of infecting bacteria as well as the availability of newer antibiotics that are taken less frequently, have improved antimicrobial activity, and are less toxic. Studies evaluating the effect of antibiotic treatment are mostly small and are difficult to compare because of heterogeneous patient populations, diverse outcome measures, and varied definitions of failure. Additionally, many different antibiotics and treatment durations have been evaluated, reducing comparability between individual studies. Two recent meta-analyses and a Cochrane review concluded that antibiotics improve outcome in AECOPD among inpatients, especially those requiring admission to an intensive care unit.133, 141, 142 Among hospitalized patients, antibiotics reduced hospital mortality by 78%.143, 144, 145 Antibiotics also led to improved peak expiratory flow by 22%.141 The largest study to date evaluating antibiotic efficacy is a retrospective cohort of 84,621 inpatients from 413 acute care centers in the United States.146 Administration of antibiotics within the first 48 hours reduced the need for mechanical ventilation after 2 hospital days (1.07% vs. 1.80%), lowered rates of inpatient mortality (1.04% vs. 1.59%), reduced readmissions (7.91% vs. 8.79%), and produced fewer treatment failures (9.77% vs. 11.75%). However, there was a higher rate of Clostridium difficile in patients who were treated with antibiotics (0.19% vs. 0.94%). The weight of evidence supports antibiotic use for hospitalized patients, particularly those admitted to the intensive care unit.",

In the Cochrane review cited earlier, reduction in treatment failure was found when analyzing all outpatient studies but not found when the analysis was restricted to studies using currently available antibiotics.37, 142, 147, 148, 149 However, a recent multicenter double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of mild to moderate AECOPD documented that amoxicillin-clavulanate improves response to therapy within 9 to 11 days (74.1% vs. 59.9%) and increased the median time to the next exacerbation from 160 days in the placebo group to 233 days in those receiving antibiotic.148 This study, which was published since the most recent meta-analysis, suggests that antibiotics may be beneficial for some patients with mild to moderate AECOPD. Several other studies have demonstrated a delayed time to relapse or exacerbation with the use of antibiotics to treat AECOPD. In a retrospective cohort outpatient study of 270 patient-visits (with relapse defined as a return visit within 14 days), antibiotics reduced the relapse rate to 19% (50/270) compared with 32% (29/92) among patients who did not receive antibiotics. Patients who received amoxicillin, however, had an even higher relapse rate of 54% (20/37) compared with those who did not receive antibiotics.150 In another study, antibiotics added to oral corticosteroids increased the median time from second to third exacerbation from 189 days to 258 days and reduced mortality.151 The limited effectiveness of antibiotics on less severe exacerbations may be a result of lower bacterial burden in this healthier group of patients.",

In one, if sputum purulence was not present and antibiotics withheld, only 2 of 32 patients failed therapy.163 In another study in which purulence was used to determine whether antibiotics would be prescribed, the therapeutic failure rate was 9% among those who had nonpurulent sputum and did not receive antibiotics versus 10% among those with purulent sputum who received antibiotics.164 It is clear that many patients are prescribed antibiotics who do not need them, but the current state of knowledge does not clearly define the group who will be harmed more than they will be helped by a course of antibiotics.

Alternately, AECOPD may be driven by changes of a complex lower airway microbiome and not by a single microorganism. A shift in the lung microbiome could produce a flare of inflammation. Given the polymicrobial nature of the microbiome, organisms may not need to be effectively treated to reduce inflammation. In the near future, unbiased culture-independent techniques will more accurately describe the lung microbiome in COPD. A better understanding of microbiome changes preceding AECOPD and alterations produced by antibiotics will improve our understanding of the antibiotic response.",

Successful use of prolonged, continuous oxytetracycline in a small number of patients was attempted in Great Britain as early as the mid-1950s.183 The effectiveness of prophylaxis with oxytetracycline was not corroborated in later studies.184, 185 More recently, erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin have been the most widely studied prophylactic agents. Observational and placebo-controlled trials suggested long-term macrolide prophylaxis is effective in reducing exacerbations and hospitalizations.186, 187, 188, 189 A recent large-scale randomized, placebo-controlled study of azithromycin, 250 mg daily for 1 year, reduced AECOPD from 1.82 exacerbations per patient-year in the placebo group to 1.48 exacerbations per patient-year in the azithromycin group. Antibiotic treatment also extended time to first exacerbation from 174 to 266 days and improved quality of life.189 The azithromycin group, however, had more hearing loss.189 Among patients who became colonized, macrolide resistance occurred in 81% of the treated group versus 41% of the placebo control group. Importantly, this trial excluded patients with cardiovascular risks, including a resting heart rate greater than 100 beats per minute, prolonged QT (QTc) interval, or medications that increase the QTc interval. Therefore, the potential for adverse cardiac reactions reported with macrolides was minimized in this study. Controversy still exists about the increased risk for cardiovascular events reported with azithromycin use.190, 191 In addition, intermittent short courses of macrolides produced a fourfold increase in S. pneumoniae within 6 months.192 The mechanisms that reduce exacerbation go beyond their antibacterial effect. These drugs are directly anti-inflammatory, decreasing proinflammatory cytokine production, adhesion molecules, and reactive oxygen species.193, 194 Long-term macrolides have also been studied in patients with cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis in whom they have led to fewer exacerbations of disease and stabilization of lung function.195, 196 For patients with low cardiovascular risk and frequent exacerbation in spite of adequate routine therapy, macrolides should be considered (see Table 67-2). However, more widespread use of macrolides in less severe COPD cases is not currently recommended.",

A recent meta-analysis included seven studies, of which two used the 14-valent vaccine and five the 23-valent vaccine.206 The authors reported that there was no reduction in the likelihood of developing pneumonia nor in preventing AECOPD among patients who received the vaccine compared with those who did not.206 Other analyses in this Cochrane review did not demonstrate a decrease in all-cause mortality or death from cardiorespiratory causes. There are no published data regarding the use of the 13-valent conjugate vaccine, which provides better coverage. A recent study has demonstrated decreased hospitalization rates after introduction of the 7-valent pneumococcal vaccines that were most marked in the very young and elderly, although present in all age groups. Although this may hold true for patients with a history of COPD, the data did not stratify patients by underlying disease or risk factors.207\n",
