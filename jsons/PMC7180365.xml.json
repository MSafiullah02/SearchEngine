As of March 9, 2020, there were 80,906 laboratory-confirmed cases in China, more than 10,000 of which are from outside of Hubei. Almost all confirmed cases had a clear epidemiological history.

The patient was a retired worker in good health and did not have diabetes, hypertension, or cardiovascular disease, and there was no history of smoking. Three days before admission, she experienced coughing, fatigue, sputum production and dyspnea after activities. Her body temperature was normal. The specialist examination revealed thick breath sounds in both lungs and a few wet pulmonary rales. Laboratory tests showed elevated levels of white blood cells (10.7; normal range 4\u201310 \u00d7 109/L) and neutrophils (8.6; normal range 2.0\u20137.0 \u00d7 109/L). The neutrophil ratio was high (80; normal range 50\u201370%), while the lymphocyte ratio was low (12.70; normal range 20\u201340%). C-reactive protein (38.55; normal range 2\u20138 mg/L) and lactate dehydrogenase (263; normal range 115\u2013220 U/L) were elevated. D-dimer, myoglobin, and troponin were normal. Complications of acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute cardiac injury, and secondary infection were not evident. It is worth noting that the patient had no record of contact with confirmed patients, had no travel history in recent months, and did not visit other cities, including Wuhan.",

In addition, the patient was given antibiotics (moxifloxacin hydrochloride and sodium chloride injection) and gastric mucosa protectants (omeprazole). After 7 days of treatment (February 6, 2020), the patient's HRCT showed that her bilateral pulmonary lesions had improved and a little fibrous stripe was evident (Fig. 1E and F). Her novel coronavirus nucleic acid tests demonstrated 2 consecutive negative results (February 7, 2020 and February 9, 2020). Medications were stopped and the patient was discharged on February 10, 2020. She was subsequently isolated at home for 14 days. HRCT images obtained after discharge (February 18, 2020) showed that lesion absorption was more obvious (Fig. 1G and H).",

Most patients with COVID-19 have a clear history of exposure, or travel, and residence in Wuhan. The patient described in this case report had no clear epidemiological history and has likely been exposed to the virus without her knowledge, hence she can be referred to as \u201csecond-generation patients\u201d.",

Current research demonstrated that the most common HRCT features of COVID-19 pneumonia are patchy/punctate ground glass opacities (85.7%), patchy consolidation (19.0%) that is mainly distributed in a sub-pleural area, and the presence of fibrous stripes after the patient's condition improves [2]. The HRCT images of this patient demonstrated almost all of these features. A recent retrospective study found that radiographic findings from chest CT were most severe on day 10 of initial symptom onset and began to improve on day 14 of initial symptom onset [3]. The findings from this patient's chest CT were typical of those with COVID-19. For this patient, recovery was earlier than usual. In contrast, most patients with COVID-19 present with fever (98%), cough (76%), and myalgia or fatigue (44%). Fever is the most common feature [4]. The patient described in this case report had no fever onset, which has not been reported previously in patients with respiratory symptoms and CT abnormalities.",
