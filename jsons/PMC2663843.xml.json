            "text": "Bluetongue (BT) is an infectious noncontagious viral disease of ruminants caused by the bluetongue virus (BTV). The virus, consisting of 24 different serotypes, is transmitted to its vertebrate host by a few species of biting midges of the Culicoides genus (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) [1]. BT is a reportable disease of considerable socioeconomic concern and of major importance in the international trade of animals and animal products. From 1998 through 2005, at least 6 BTV strains belonging to 5 serotypes (BTV-1, BTV-2, BTV-4, BTV-9, and BTV-16) were continously present in the Mediterranean Basin [2], [3], [4]. Since August 2006, BTV-8 has caused severe epizootic outbreakes in northern Europe [5]. The emergence of BT in parts of Europe never before affected was attributed mainly to climate change and linked to the Northern expansion of the major Old World vector Culicoides imicola. Additionally, there is also evidence for the involvement of other novel indigenous European vector species of Culicoides (C. obsoletus and C. pulicaris ) [6].",

The outer capsid is composed of two major structural proteins, VP2 and VP5 (segments 2 and 6, respectively), involved in cell attachment and virus entry. VP2 is known to contain the major neutralization determinant of BTV while VP5 influences virus neutralization through its conformational interaction with VP2 [8].

            "text": "Bluetongue virus is a potent interferon alpha (IFN-\u03b1) inducer [14], [15], [16]. In addition, a temporal relationship between viremia and IFN-\u03b1 activity has been observed in sheep infected with BTV, where IFN peak concentrations induced approximately a 90% decrease in virus titer [17]. IFN-\u03b1 plays an essential role in the antiviral innate immune response. Virus-derived dsRNAs are detected by Toll-like receptors on type I IFN-producing cells (mostly notably on plasmacytoid dendritic cells). Secreted IFNs bind to the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR) on the surface of neighbouring cells, activating the Janus kinase (Jak)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat) signalling pathway. This in turn induces the transcriptional activation of target genes, the products of which render the cells resistant to virus replication through various mechanisms, including degradation of viral mRNAs, inhibition of viral translation, and inhibition of cell growth [18], [19], [20], [21]. Blocking IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 activity in mice leads to a dramatically increased sensitivity to many viruses. Genetically targeted (knockout) mice lacking the \u03b2 subunit of the IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor (IFNAR(\u2212/\u2212) mice) are unable to establish an antiviral state and, as a consequence, are highly susceptible to many viral infections, despite the presence of an otherwise intact immune system [20], [22]. Recently, Ida-Hosonuma et al [23] found that the deletion of the IFNAR gene in the IFNAR(\u2212/\u2212) mice resulted in the disruption of IFN- \u03b1/\u03b2-induced signaling, which is an important determinant of the tissue tropism and pathogenicity of poliovirus. Similarly, it has been reported that IFN- \u03b1/\u03b2 plays an important role in the pathogenicity and tissue tropism of some viruses. The lack of an IFN system allows the virus to replicate more efficiently and IFNAR(\u2212/\u2212) mice have been used as a laboratory animal model to study the immune response and pathogenicity of coronaviruses, vaccinia virus Ankara strain (MVA), measles virus, Rift valley fever virus and West Nile virus [24], [25], [26], [27]. All these data, and the presence of an otherwise intact immune system in these mice [20], [22] suggest that IFNAR(\u2212/\u2212) mice could be a good animal model to study BTV infections and to evaluate vaccine strategies against this virus.",

IFNAR(\u2212/\u2212) mice inoculated with 102 PFU did not show any viremia but titers up to 3\u00d7104 PFU/ml were observed at 3 and 4 days p.i. in mice inoculated with 103 PFUs. Viral spread was determined in tissue samples. The first tissue to be reached by the virus was the spleen (Fig. 2B) where infectious virus was detected as early as 24 h.p.i.

By 48 h.p.i. significant titers of BTV-4 were detected in spleen, lung, thymus, and popliteal and mesenteric lymph nodes. At 72 h.p.i., titers up to 106 PFU/gr of BTV-4 were recovered from the spleen, lung, thymus, and lymph nodes (popliteal, inguinal, mediastinal and mesenteric). No infectious virus was detected in liver, brain, heart, tongue, skin, and testicles at any time points examined, even when the tissues were analyzed by RT-PCR (data not shown). Interestingly, the virus was not detected in the blood until 48 h.p.i. These results suggest that the virus leaks into the blood stream after replicating in the spleen.",

However, BTV-8 showed higher virulence than BTV-4 with only 10 PFUs of BTV-8 being enough to kill 100% of the mice at day 7 p.i.

BTV-8 was first detected in blood of mice inoculated with 10 PFUs at day 4 post-infection, and the titer increased up to 2\u00d7104 PFU/ml at day 5 p.i.

Although BTV-8 showed higher virulence than BTV-4 in IFNAR(\u2212/\u2212) mice, BTV-8 and BTV-4 titers in blood were equivalent, indicating that the higher virulence of serotype 8 is not due to a higher level of viral replication.

Gross pathological alterations were characterized by widespread oedema, haemorrhages especially in spleen and lungs, and enlarged spleen and lymph nodes. Histological examination of lungs of BTV infected mice showed hyperemia and increased septum size with infiltration of lymphocytes, inactivated macrophages and a few neutrophils (Fig. 4). The peribronchial and perivascular connective tissue contained a few infiltrating round cells (Fig. 4). These histopathological findings are consistent with bronchointerstitial pneumonia. There was also a moderate oedema in the alveolar cavity with presence of abundant alveolar macrophages and a few detached epithelial cells (descamative alveolitis). The infected spleen showed a marked lymphoid depletion with infiltration of neutrophils in the white pulp (Fig. 4). This lymphoid depletion was also observed in the thymus as well as the loss of thymic architecture with the medulla and the cortex becoming not distinguishable (data not shown).

To provide further proof that BTV-4 was the causative agent of the disease and death in these animals and that IFNAR(\u2212/\u2212) mice are a good animal model for BTV vaccination studies, vaccination protection experiments were performed. Adult IFNAR(\u2212/\u2212) mice were immunized with a ZULVAC-BTV-4 inactivated BTV-4 preparation. The vaccine was administered by two consecutive subcutaneous injections of the equivalent to 3\u00d7105 TCID50 of BTV-4 at 3 weeks intervals. After the second immunization, VP2 antibody titers were determined by ELISA. All immunized animals, but not the control animals, developed an antibody response (Fig. 5A) indicating a successful immunization. In addition, the immunization induced neutralizing antibodies against BTV-4 in IFNAR(\u2212/\u2212) mice (VNT 1.53\u00b10.32) as detected by virus neutralization tests. Three weeks after the second immunization, immunized and control IFNAR(\u2212/\u2212) mice were challenged intravenously with 103 PFUs of BTV-4. While all nonimmunized animals died, 100% of the immunized animals were protected against a lethal challenge (Fig. 5B). Infectious viral titers were analyzed in the blood of immunized and nonimmunized IFNAR(\u2212/\u2212) mice by plaque assay after intravenous infection with BTV-4 (Fig. 5C). No Infectious viruses were detected in immunized mice; however, we observed titers up to 3\u00d7104 PFU/ml in nonimmunized animals at day 5 post-challenge. In addition, we analyzed by RT-qPCR the presence of BTV genomes in the blood of inmmunized and nonimmunized IFNAR(\u2212/\u2212) mice challenged with BTV-4. The results are summarized in Table 1. BTV genomes were readily detected in nonimmunized mice at days three and four after BTV infection (Ct: 27\u201329) and increased (Ct: 23\u201326) thereafter until the death of the animal. In contrast, the RT-qPCR reaction yield no positive results for the majority of the immunized mice (n = 5) at all days post-challenge analyzed (Ct\u226538). Viral genomes were detected in one of the vaccinated mice (Ct: 30) at days four and five post-challenge and in two of them at day 5 (Ct: 32). However, in these three immunized mice the Ct was higher than in the nonimmunized mice and the presence of BTV-genomes reverted to negative at day 7 post-challenge. Overall, these data indicate that protective immunity was achieved after vaccination. These results confirm that BTV-4 was the causative agent of disease and death of adult IFNAR(\u2212/\u2212) mice.",

Here, we characterize a new animal model based on adult IFNAR(\u2212/\u2212) mice that support the in vivo growth of BTV-4 and BTV-8 after intravenous inoculation. A tremendous advantage of this mouse model is the availability of a wide variety of reagents that can be used to study many aspects of the immune response to the virus. In addition, we propose this animal model as an adequate system for testing BTV vaccines, an important issue because the cost of testing new vaccines in target species is a major obstacle for laboratories and industries. The new mouse model for the study of BTV infection has unique features that open the possibility to study in the same host-virus system susceptibility, virulence, immunobiology of infection, and vaccine efficacy, in ways that are not approachable with the natural host.",

Different approaches have been followed to avoid this problem. The protective effects of baculovirus expressed BTV-10 minor and non-structural proteins were assessed by measuring virus titers in the ovaries of mice challenged with homologous recombinant vaccinia virus (rVV). Protection mediated by CTLs specific for the BTV minor or nonstructural proteins could not be evaluated by challenging mice with BTV-10, as the virus does not cause disease in adult mice [29]. The infection of fetal mice with BTV leads to severe cerebral malformation. Infection of 2-week-old mice resulted in very limited multiplication without sequelae, and infection of 4-week-old mice did not show clinical disease and no viral multiplication was detected [30]. Thus, the use of highly immature mice results in pathologies that do not resemble those found in the natural host. Another aspect to consider is the route of inoculation that may determine the outcome of infection. In this work, we have used the intravenous inoculation to resemble the natural infection route by mosquito biting. Thus, mice infected with BTV i.v. develop clinical symptoms, as it happens in natural hosts. This makes the mouse model even more atractive to be used as a tool for studying immune response to BTV and vaccination strategies.",

            "text": "Up-regulation of type I IFN is one of the earliest cellular responses upon contact with infectious agents. The rapid induction of type I IFN reflects the crucial role that this cytokine plays in the inhibition of viral spread before the generation of a specific immune response. Given that viruses must at least partially circumvent the IFN response, it is not surprising that an inability to do this can restrict host range. There are many examples where this is known. For example, neither measles virus nor polio virus will replicate efficiently in mouse models unless the IFN system has been compromised [24], [31]. BTV is a potent type I interferon inducer in mice and cattle [14], [16], [32]. Our results show that BTV is pathogenic for IFNAR(\u2212/\u2212) mice mainly due to the lack of the IFN-I receptor, allowing the virus to circumvent the IFN-I response in the host. In addition, IFNAR(\u2212/\u2212) mice serve as a good animal model for BTV, reproducing many aspects of its natural host infection. First, IFNAR(\u2212/\u2212) mice infected with BTV showed viremia and disease symptoms, in contrast with C57BL/6 mice, which did not show them, even when these animals were infected at the highest viral dose tested (106 PFUs/mouse). The appearance of viremia after inoculation in infected IFNAR(\u2212/\u2212) mice was dependent on the viral dose, althought the highest titers observed in blood were not dose-dependent. Second, the differential virulence of serotypes 4 and 8 were maintained in this animal model. Some BTV serotypes such as serotype 8, which recently caused infection in northern Europe, exhibit enhanced virulence in cattle [5], in contrast to BTV-4 that usually exhibits subclinical infections in this species. In infected IFNAR(\u2212/\u2212) mice, BTV-8 killed 100% of the animals with a dose as low as 10 PFUs per mouse. In contrast 103 PFUs of BTV-4 were needed to kill 100% of the mice. In addition, the virus titers found in the blood of infected mice were similar at the same virus doses for the animals infected with BTV-8 than with BTV-4, indicating that BTV-8 exhibited a higher virulence than BTV-4 in the IFNAR(\u2212/\u2212) model, as is observed in cattle, one of the BTV natural hosts. Third, BTV dissemination in IFNAR(\u2212/\u2212) mice reproduced BTV infection in cattle and sheep. High titers of BTV are present in the lungs, precapsular and mesenteric lymph nodes, thymus, and spleen of infected calves [33], [34]. In IFNAR(\u2212/\u2212) mice, the virus was detected in spleen before was isolated from other organs, including blood. Release of BTV from spleen was followed by an increased in viremia and dissemination to other organs (lymph nodes, lung and thymus), followed by its dissemination to lymph nodes, lung, and thymus after intravenous infection. This has been suggested also for calves [34] indicating a similar BTV spreading pattern in IFNAR(\u2212/\u2212) mice. Histological analyses of BTV infected mice at 48 h.p.i. showed many similarities with lessions described in natural hosts. The permeability disorders of the vascular system described for ruminants [35] is reflected in the petecheias observed in spleen in BTV infected mice. The enlargement of lymph nodes reflects an ongoing immune response. However, the observed lymphoid depletion suggests that other cells are migrating to these organs or that a general aedema results in organ enlargement. The lungs are especially susceptible to permeability disorders of the vasculature induced by BTV, and this is consistent in BTV infected mice as well as in ruminants. In general, pathology in natural hosts has not been profoundly studied. The described pathology similarities between IFNAR(\u2212/\u2212) mice and ruminants after infection with BTV indicate that our mouse model may be a good tool to study new findings in BTV pathology.",

            "text": "The cost of testing new vaccines in target species is a major obstacle for laboratories and industries. For this reason, the intracerebral inoculation of newborn mice with BTV vaccines has been used as an animal model to evaluate the level of attenuation of live attenuated BTV vaccines [28]. Our results show that adult IFNAR(\u2212/\u2212) mice serve as a good animal model to test BTV vaccines. Even though the lack of type I interferon signals may have an effect in the development of acquired immune responses, our results and previous studies [20], [22], [24], [25], [26], [27] show that the IFNAR(\u2212/\u2212) infection model is useful for the definition of effective vaccine candidates against BTV. Indeed, in our study all immunized animals developed an antibody response specific of BTV-4 with the production of neutralizing antibodies against the same serotype, indicating a successful immunization. The protection mediated by inactivated whole BTV vaccine in IFNAR(\u2212/\u2212) mice infected with a lethal dose of BTV-4 was complete, and 100% of the animals did not show any symptoms associated with infection or died. Viremia was not detected in the blood of immunized animals after challenge with BTV-4 when analyzed by plaque assay. The presence of BTV genomes in the blood of immunized mice after BTV-4 challenge analyzed by RT-qPCR, a more sensible method than the plaque assay, showed the presence of viral genomes in the blood of some of the immunized mice but in all the cases, the Cts were higher than in the nonimmunized mice and those that were RT-qPCR positive reverted to negative at day seven post-challenge. Similar RTqPCR results have been observed in cattle and sheep vaccinated with ZULVAC-BTV-4 inactivated BTV-4 preparation [36] These results strongly support the involvement of BTV in the pathological processes described in this work and, moreover, suggest that the mouse model is adequate to evaluate vaccine candidates. Future work will determine whether the ability to protect mice with other vaccine formulations mimics the capacity to protect the natural host.",
