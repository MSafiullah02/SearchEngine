Methods An online survey was performed of orthopaedic surgeons in the German-speaking Arthroscopy Society (Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Arthroskopie und Gelenkchirurgie, AGA). The survey consisted of 20 questions concerning four topics: four questions addressed the origin and surgical experience of the participant, 12 questions dealt with potential cutbacks in orthopaedic healthcare and 4 questions addressed the influence of the pandemic on the particular surgeon. Results Of 4234 contacted orthopaedic surgeons, 1399 responded. Regarding arthroscopic procedures between 10 and 30% of the participants stated that these were still being performed-with actual percentages depending on the specific joint and procedure. Only 6.2% of the participants stated that elective total joint arthroplasty was still being performed at their centre. In addition, physical rehabilitation and surgeons' postoperative follow-ups were severely affected. Conclusion Orthopaedic healthcare services in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland are suffering a drastic cutback due to COVID-19. A drastic reduction in arthroscopic procedures like rotator cuff repair and cruciate ligament reconstruction and an almost total shutdown of elective total joint arthroplasty were reported. Long-term consequences cannot be predicted yet. The described disruption in orthopaedic healthcare services has to be viewed as historic. Level of evidence V.",

            "text": "When attempting to compare our study with others it appears that, to our very best knowledge, only one study about the effects of the COVID-19 epidemic on orthopaedic healthcare services has been conducted so far [9] . That study by Thaler et al. investigated potential disruptions in joint arthroplasty services all across Europe. Similar to our study, the authors used an online survey to ask arthroplasty surgeons of (a) the European Hip Society and (b) the European Knee Associates about cutbacks in total joint arthroplasty. Thaler et al. reported that of the 272 participants, only 5.9% were still able to offer primary elective total joint arthroplasty. Aseptic arthroplasty revisions were reported by 3.8% of the participants to still be taking place. They further communicated that 87.2%, 75.6% and 25.8% of their survey participants were operating on periprosthetic fractures, doing septic arthroplasty revisions and tumour arthroplasties, respectively. Taken together, the results of the study by Thaler et al. were quite congruent with the findings of this study. This is to say that only fractures, malignancies and severe infections are being treated surgically. However, the Fig. 3 Participants' statements on whether specific surgical procedures were still being performed at their hospital comparability of the two studies might be impaired because the study at hand consulted mainly surgeons preferring sports orthopaedics, while Thaler et al. consulted mainly arthroplasty surgeons. Another aspect possibly influencing comparability is that in our study, the participants' origin was Austria, Germany and Switzerland, while the other study included surgeons from all over Europe. It was previously shown that postponing orthopaedic procedures not only means prolonged pain, but may even lead to poorer outcome overall. For example, Mossmayer et al. prospectively followed 103 patients with rotator cuff tears over 10 years and found that those with delayed repair had significantly poorer results than did those who underwent early repair-an effect that became even worse from year to year [8] .",

However, no publication has described the impact of the pandemic on the social life of physicians. It is demonstrated by the findings of the study that the pandemic is having a huge impact on the behaviour of orthopaedic surgeons towards their families at home. Only 2% of the survey participants reported making no changes in their behaviour at all, while 29.3% of our surgeons reported isolating themselves in different ways at home (13.2% kept distance to other family member, 8.6% avoided physical contact, 4.7% lived in separate rooms at home, 2.8% no longer went home, because they were afraid to harm their family). Because healthcare professionals like physicians are at risk of contracting COVID-19 [6] , orthopaedic surgeons in Austria, Germany and Switzerland are obviously trying to protect their families from the disease and, therefore, are declining to have physical contact with them or even see them. Hence, 40.3% of all ticked response options showed some kind of self-imposed social distancing at home. Approximately 11% kept a distance to their hospital or private practice because of the pandemic, potentially also related to a shortage of appropriate personal protective equipment [5] .",

First, the findings from the German-speaking countries in central Europe cannot be 100% extrapolated to other countries with other healthcare systems, like the US or China. Second, our survey may not be absolutely well balanced, because all participants were members of the 'AGA-Society of Arthroscopy and Joint-Surgery' and, therefore, the majority of them might have a more sports orthopaedic interest. In other words, arthroplasty surgeons may have been underrepresented in our survey.",

Instead, it must be assumed that due to the fact that surgical treatment cannot occur in a timely manner also the final outcome is impaired (e.g. meniscal repair performed 3 months later than usual). For orthopaedics, the way ahead is not clear and may substantially vary between different countries. But, it is most likely that as soon as a decline of new COVID-19 cases will occur in a country, a cautious and gradual resumption of routine orthopaedic procedures will be initiated [4] . However, it is believed by the authors that orthopaedic surgery will not be able to return to a pre-pandemic level earlier than within 3 months.",
