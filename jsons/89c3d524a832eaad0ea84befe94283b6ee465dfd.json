They also choose how to evaluate their learning and how to present the knowledge they had learnt about the subject-matter and about themselves as learners. Thus, the lecturers can decide \"how much\" of the heutagogy elements they want to include in their course.",

The reason is that we do not propose a technologically oriented modification of the academic tradition.

Does it have a chance to be more than an isolated and peripheral phenomenon in higher education? Shklovsky (1917) claims that the role of art is to restore the sensation of life, which mean to refresh, create, and expand the meaning of the familiar reality. People become less aware to their reality, an idea illustrated by Shklovsky who described a group of people living by the sea who turned to be deaf to the sound of the waves. He suggests calling the role of the art defamiliarization and offers the metaphor of \"to make a stone stony\", which means to realize the essence of things. Defamiliarization encourages people to create an open and ongoing dialogue with what they are already familiar with, such as nature, people, texts, phenomena, and theories, in order to expand their meaning.",

Our postmodern culture suffers from a \"crisis of trust\". The price is high for it leads to tough regulation policies. To ensure that students will learn, we impose more requirements and quality assurance procedures. We forget that \"trust breeds trust\" (2002) . Heutagogy advances the idea that we trust the students and their desire to learn. We trust that they know what they want, and that they want to improve the quality of their life. Some of them need to learn how to do it. And we believe that to this end, heutagogy might be a promising starting point.",
