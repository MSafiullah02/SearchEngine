As a neutrophil chemokine, IL\u20108 has been known to correlate with neutrophil numbers in alveolar fluid in ARDS.\n18\n Elevation of IL\u20108 has been found in some SARS patients with adverse outcomes.\n4\n In a study of 23 SARS patients, Jiang et al.\n16\n further found that the elevation of IL\u20108 was closely associated with super\u2010infection during SARS. Similar elevations of IL\u20108 in bacterial CAP, but not in SARS infection, was found in our study. The elevation of IL\u20108 may only indicate a superimposed bacterial infection rather than being a unique indicator of SARS.",

In a study of dendritic cells, Law et al.\n29\n found that unlike the usual response of dendritic cells to viral infection, antiviral cytokines, including IFN\u2010\u03b1, IFN\u2010\u03b2, IFN\u2010\u03b3 and IL\u201012p40, were not activated during SARS. Clinically, the SARS\u2010CoV viral load in the respiratory tract peaked at about day 10 after the onset of clinical disease,\n30\n which is very different from other respiratory viral infections. In common respiratory viral infections, such as respiratory syncytial virus or influenza, peak viral titres are usually reached within 2\u20133 days after the onset of symptoms.\n31\n The lack of antiviral cytokines, including interferons, probably allows a longer period for viral proliferation of up to 10 days in SARS\u2010CoV infection.",

Third, the influence of immuno\u2010suppressive therapy on the profile of cytokines/chemokines in SARS is still uncertain and requires further investigation. Fourth, almost all CAP patients developed pneumonia due to bacterial infection rather than a viral infection.
