The spike protein (S protein) of SARS-CoV-2 consists of S1 and S2 subunits on the viral membrane, which is similar to SARS-CoV. The S1 subunit contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD) for binding the cellular receptor. Furin, a kind of cell surface protein which can cleaves S protein into S1 and S2 and enhance the ability of viral fusion with host cell membrane [4]. The S2 subunit, comprised of fusion peptide (FP), heptad repeat 1 (HR1), heptad repeat 2 (HR2), transmembrane domain (TM), and cytoplasmic domain fusion (CP), is responsible for mediating viral fusion and entry. The S2 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 is highly conserved and is 99% homologous to the S2 subunit of the two bat SARS-Like Coronaviruses (SL-CoV ZXC21 and ZC45) and the human SARS-Like Coronavirus. Recent research highlights that angiotensin-converting enzyme \u2161 (ACE2), a known receptor for SARS, is the recognition receptor for SARS-CoV-2 [[5], [6], [7]]. Thus, the infection pathway of the SARS-CoV-2 should be similar to other known coronaviruses, such as SARS and MERS [8], warranting the use of peptidic inhibitors against S2 as an effective prevention and treatment strategy for fighting the SARS-CoV-2 [9].",

During the membrane fusion process, the S protein has three conformational states: a prefusion native state, a pre-hairpin intermediate state, and a stable post-fusion hairpin state. Before binding with the receptor, the S protein exit in prefusion native state. When S protein bind with the receptor, the S1 subunit will be degraded and expose the S2 unit. The S protein is in the pre-hairpin intermediate state. Then three pairs of HR1 and HR2 form a six-helix bundle structure, and the fusion core takes shape [10]. Currently, the S protein is in the stable post-fusion hairpin state. When the blocking peptide bind to HR1, which can prevent S2 conformationally change to the post-fusion hairpin state will inhibit membrane fusion and consequently virus entry into cells.",

The highly conserved HR regions suggest that the cell entry mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to that of SARS. In the HR region of the seven coronaviruses, short amino-acid sequences is highly conserved, such as AIS and RLD in HR1 and KWPW in HR2. These highly conserved amino-acid short sequences may be the functional module of the HR region that mediating formation of fusion core. After multiple sequence alignment, the homologous HR1 (from Y904 to E965) and HR2 (from E1151 to Y1215) sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were obtained. Using LearnColi-VMF and referring to the fusion core construction strategy of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, HR1 and HR2 were screened in more detail to obtain sequences of HR1 (from Q920 to L965) and HR2 (from I1169 to I1202) (Fig. 1c) [14,15,23,24]. Then the HR region of SARS-CoV-2 is connected by linker with 22 amino, which is flexible and long enough to allow the HR1 and HR2 region to interact spontaneously to form a peptide of 102 amino acids in length [24].",

In contract, HR2-P didn\u2019t form extra hydrogen bonds with HR1. In addition, the extra amino acid can form hydrogen bonds each other which can be helpful to stabilize the structure of HR2.

The binding energy of HR1 to the side groove of two HR1s is -40.3kCal/mol, which is larger than that of HR2-P and HR2-anti-P. To explain why HR1-P has high binding energy, we made a guess that when HR1-P docked with two HR1s, they will form a HR1 trimer and the hydrophobic groups are wrapped in the center of the trimer just like in the S protein. Therefore, the binding energy is relatively high. If HR1-P is used as an antivirus peptide, HR1-P will bind to the side groove instead of forming trimer. Therefore, we docked the HR1-P to the HR1 trimer and calculated the binding energy again (Fig. 5b). By performing umbrella sampling again, the binding exergy of HR1-P is about -21.8kCal/mol which proved that our conjecture is correct.",

In 1993, Wild C, Greenwell T, et al. synthesized a peptide based on the envelope glycoprotein of HIV. The anti-virus peptide has a significant effect of blocking the fusion of HIV-1 with host cells [25,26]. The fusion process is essential for virus entry into the host cells. When the S protein binds to the host receptor, the furin cut the S protein at the S1/S2 cleavage site. The HR1 and HR2 regions, which are located in the S2 subunit, are exposed and form the fusion core. The formation of fusion core induces the virus membrane fusion with the host cell membrane. The antivirus peptide can bind to HR1 more strongly and prevent HR2 from binding to HR1 to form the fusion core (Fig. 6\n).",

In 2004, Bosch BJ et al. experimentally compared the ability of HR1 and HR2 peptides as inhibitors to block SARS-CoV infection in Vero cells [27]. They found that HR2-like peptidic inhibitor, but not HR1-like peptide inhibitor, dose-dependently inhibited viral infection. Our data also show a similar effect in SARS-CoV-2. The\u0394GHR2 is -33.4 kCal/mol, stronger than\u0394GHR1 -21.8kCal/mol. Biochemical and electron microscopic analysis revealed that one HR1 binds three HR2 in an antiparallel pattern, thus may explain why HR1 derived peptide failed to inhibit viral infection. Thus, HR2-like peptide competitively inhibits the binding of the HR2 domain to the HR1 domain, thus blocking the formation of viral fusion core [14], while HR1-like peptide is less efficient in preventing HR1 and HR2 binding. These studies on SARS-CoV and our data on SARS-CoV-2 highlight that peptidic inhibitor based on the HR2 domain is a promising strategy to treat coronavirus infections.",

The S proteins are embedded in the viral membrane and are composed of the S1 and S2 subunits. The S1 subunit contains one receptor-binding domain (RBD). The S2 subunit mediates the virus/cell membrane fusion and the entry of the virus. RBD of the S1 subunit binds to the host ACE2 receptor when the SARS-CoV-2 contacts with the cell membrane. Furin cleaves the S protein into the S1 subunit and the S2 subunit. The fusion peptide (FP) of S2 is exposed and is inserted into the target cell membrane. Three HR1s and three HR2s combine to form the fusion core, pulling the viral membrane to fuse with the host cell membrane. The designed and computational-optimized anti-virus peptides can bind to HR1 more tightly, preventing the HR1s and HR2s from forming fusion core.",
