In children who wheezed, the risk of AE and admissions to hospital were also significantly increased in the 2 years after the first antibiotic prescription. Children who received antibiotics in infancy had significantly lower induction of cytokines from PBMCs (taken at age 11) stimulated ex vivo with viruses, but surprisingly, not bacteria. The authors concluded that an increased susceptibility to viral infections is associated with both early\u2010life antibiotic prescription and asthma risk, although the authors could not exclude reverse causation, in that antibiotic use or asthma influences PBMC responses to viruses later in life. There was also a significant association with antibiotic prescription in the first year of life in that children carrying a G allele in ZPBP2 (SNP rs11557467) and those carrying a C allele in the gene encoding orosomucoid 1\u2010like 3 (ORMDL3) (SNP rs4795405) were at higher risk of being prescribed antibiotics. Although its function is not completely clear, ORMDL3 is expressed on the endoplasmic reticulum in bronchial epithelial cells and is thought to activate the unfolded protein response pathway. The association of antibiotic use with ORMDL3 is of particular excitement, as this gene has recently been highlighted in Genome\u2010Wide Association Studies in asthma14 and in the risk of virus\u2010induced wheeze.15\n",

Macrolides may have additional properties to their bacteriostatic function, such as anti\u2010inflammatory21 and even antiviral activity.22, 23 Despite their ability to inhibit both bacteria and virus infections, only a few studies have tested macrolides as therapies for asthma or AE. Guidelines state very little on macrolide use in asthma, and studies have shown positive effects on severe and neutrophilic asthma, yet the evidence supporting this is conflicting. These studies in both stable asthma and AE have been recently reviewed,24 and the data suggest macrolide\u2010responsive subgroups (eg neutrophilic asthma) may exist.25, 26 Additionally, recent studies also report a reduction in severe LRTI rates27 and asthma\u2010like symptoms28 for children with azithromycin. For such studies where macrolides exhibited positive effects, it is difficult to ascertain a responsible mechanism. It is possible that a combination of antibacterial, antiviral and anti\u2010inflammatory properties may all contribute. Further carefully designed studies capable of appropriate sampling to obtain mechanistic insights are needed before this is clarified. The use of macrolides could further be tested in human challenge studies rather than those relying on natural infection. Macrolide use in asthma also suffers from the potential of encouraging antibiotic\u2010resistant bacteria, and microbiologists have also questioned how these drugs may disturb the microbiome.29, 30\n",

A possible explanation for this association is that antibiotics affect the microbiome in a negative way and thus increase susceptibility to disease. With the realization that the microbiome is key in controlling host immunity early in life, and the design of supportive animal studies that have modelled this association and identified protective genera,31 this idea has merit but the overall hypothesis remains to be thoroughly tested in human clinical models. Antibiotics may also be associated with asthma via other, as yet to be identified mechanisms, and likely involve reverse causation. The narrower antibacterial spectrum of some macrolide antibiotics, combined with their other advantageous properties, suggests that these may have use in AE but their use remains controversial.",

Anti\u2010infectives (such as antibiotics, antifungals and antivirals) directly act on the pathogen or its receptor limiting infection or replication. Vaccines work by boosting both innate and importantly, adaptive immune responses (provided by dendritic cells, T and B lymphocytes) to the pathogen providing long\u2010lasting protection. Immunomodulators including TLR agonists, BL, vitamin D act on the immune system, boosting innate immune responses providing short\u2010term protection. Vitamin D may act on underlying immune responses, such as inflammatory responses or allergic inflammation, reducing pathogen\u2010driven inflammation or pathogen\u2010driven enhanced allergic inflammation. Microbiome modulators such as probiotics may alter the microbiome of the gut. This may have important downstream effects on the immune system, such as those that affect respiratory immunology and asthma",

Challenges facing the design and implementation of therapies that directly target pathogens or their biology (in blue) include site of infection and site of drug delivery, route of delivery, specific mechanism of action, the drug's pharmacodynamics (PD) and pharmacokinetics (PK) and also the patient demographic (Pt), subset or specific endophenotype of asthma concerned. These challenges can at least in part be addressed by preclinical studies and are often taken into account during drug design. Unknowns are also identified (in red) and can be model or pathogen specific. These include, but are not limited to, the window of therapeutic opportunity (\u0394t) for therapeutic treatments, which defines the time between infection and onset of clinical disease (LRTI symptoms for asthma), and importantly, this variable thus describes the window in which suppressing replication in theory will suppress symptoms and/or clinical disease. How pathogen load affects clinical disease is also controlled by a second variable (\u0394l), which defines the quantity of pathogen that has to be affected to observe a quantitative change in clinical disease or symptoms. The unknown c defines a comparison, between a new drug (eg antiviral) versus the standard treatment (eg GC). This unknown is important as regulatory authorities will not approve a new drug if does not show improvements or a better safety profile compared with the standard treatment already available. The unknown d represents duration of treatment; this takes into account other variables that are often difficult to predict and include the possible effects of secondary infections (eg bacterial co\u2010infection), drug resistance (eg as seen with macrolides), plasticity of endophenotype treated and other complexities that can impact on clinical disease after pathogen load is decreased as defined by \u0394l. Theoretical relationships between pathogen and load and clinical disease are based on human challenge studies with RV, in asthmatic individuals57, 58\n",
