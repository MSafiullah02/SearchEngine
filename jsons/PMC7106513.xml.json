The health impact of these viruses varies; some waterborne viruses cause gastroenteritis, respiratory infections, conjunctivitis, hepatitis, aseptic meningitis, encephalitis and paralysis as shown in Table 1\n. Moreover, the infective dose can be very low, for instance it has been estimated that \u223c10\u2013100 virions of norovirus are capable of causing human infection (Lindesmith et al., 2003). Thus, even the presence of a few viral particles poses a threat to public health. Sometimes the role of viruses in waterborne and water-related diseases is difficult to assess. This could be due to a lack of data, difficulties to define the source of infections, sub-clinical infections and secondary transmission, in addition the virus may escape the detection method (Grabow, 2007).",

There are some enteric viruses which are easy to propagate (enteroviruses), others are difficult to propagate (rotavirus and hepatitis A virus), and for some there are no cell lines available for propagation (human noroviruses). Although an infectivity assay for norovirus has recently been described, this assay requires highly differentiated 3D cell culture of human embryonic intestinal epithelial cell line INT-407, which can support the natural growth of human NoV (Straub et al., 2007). Since the assay itself requires a cell line that is not widely available and combined with the required special technique, it is difficult to use on a routine basis.",

Detection of enteric viruses using PCR or RT-PCR has been extensively described for aquatic environments (Mattison and Bidawid, 2009). Additionally, the multiplex PCR can be used for detection of several types, groups or species in one reaction. In real time PCR assays, amplification and detection of viral genome are combined in one reaction leading to faster availability of results and reduction of the risk of false positive results by contamination with PCR products. Although molecular methods have the highest degree of sensitivity and specificity, the co-concentration of PCR inhibitors from environmental water samples may represent a limitation for the use of PCR as a detection method. Therefore, it is important to include controls for detection of PCR inhibition for each sample. The inhibitory effect can then be relieved or reduced by several approaches such as pre-dilution of the extracted nucleic acid prior to PCR reaction (Brooks et al., 2005, Hamza et al., 2009a), the use of some PCR additives (Demeke and Adams, 1992, Kreader, 1996), removal of inhibitors during nucleic acid purification (Braid et al., 2003) and the use of some polymeric adsorbents (Abbaszadegan et al., 1993, Koonjul et al., 1999, Schriewer et al., 2011).",

Examples of well-known cell types that are standard for environmental virology laboratories are buffalo green monkey (BGM) kidney cells, African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells, primary liver carcinoma (PLC/PRF/5) cells, fetal rhesus monkey kidney cells (FrhK-4), human epithelial type 2 (HEp-2) cells, human lung carcinoma cells (A549), rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells, human colon carcinoma cells (CaCo-2), and simian kidney epithelial (MA104) cells (Abad et al., 1998, Ali and Abdel-Dayem, 2003, Ali et al., 2004, Bosch et al., 2004, Chapron et al., 2000, Dahling et al., 1974, Dahling and Wright, 1986, Ehlers et al., 2005, El-Senousy et al., 2007, Fout et al., 1996, Frosner et al., 1979, Hashimoto et al., 1991, Ko et al., 2003, Morris, 1985, Pinto et al., 1994, Rodriguez et al., 2008, Sedmak et al., 2005). Combination of more than one cell line may allow the detection of unanticipated agents, rather than focusing on the detection of only one or a few specific viruses. For example a combination of A549 and BGMK cells and molecular identification could be a useful tool for monitoring infectious adenoviruses (AdV) and enteroviruses (EV) in aquatic environments (Lee et al., 2004). Indeed, no single cell line is able to propagate all viruses even within the same virus group. For instance, among the EV group, which includes polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, and other numbered serotypes of EV, there is much similarity in terms of structure and surface antigens, however, there is no single cell line that allows proliferation of all EV strains (Leland and Ginocchio, 2007). If EV is the virus of interest in a water sample, cell lines such as BGM, CaCO-2 or RD can be used. Furthermore, detection of EV serotype spectrum can be broaden by the use of human embryonic lung or kidney cells, primary monkey kidney cells or Vero cells, as well as an intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) over-expressing HeLa cell line (Hovi et al., 2007).",

After a 30\u201390-min incubation of the inoculated tube in a horizontal position at 37 \u00b0C, excess inoculum is discarded and fresh maintenance cell culture medium is added (Leland and Ginocchio, 2007). Cytopathogenic or cytopathic effect (CPE) of the virus is monitored by microscopic examination daily for the first week of incubation to maximize the detection of viral growth and on alternate days for the remainder of the incubation period. Some viruses take 1 day to 3 weeks to produce a CPE depending on the initial concentration and virus type. CPE can be swelling, shrinking, rounding of cells to clustering or complete destruction of the monolayer (Leland and Ginocchio, 2007). This can also be done in a quantitative form and the virus can be enumerated as most probable number (MPN) (Chapron et al., 2000, Gantzer et al., 1998, Shieh et al., 2008) or tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) units (Calgua et al., 2011, Enriquez and Gerba, 1995, Jiang et al., 2004, Kok et al., 1998). MPN test involves observation of CPE in monolayers inoculated with different dilutions of viral suspension and subsequent use of MPN table or MPN software program to determine the viral counts. In TCID50 test the titre is calculated as the logarithm of the dilution of the virus producing a CPE in 50% of the cultures (Reed and Muench, 1938).",

The method involves inoculation of the cell culture with virus suspension, followed by immobilisation with agar to keep growing plaques separated. One plaque is taken as being the progeny of one infectious virus particle. However, such counts should be interpreted with caution, especially when data are used in quantitative microbial risk assessment to estimate the public health impact (Teunis et al., 2005). It should be noted that many viruses do not form plaques and so they will not be detected under agar.",

The method was used to assess the inactivation of hepatitis A virus by chlorine (Li et al., 2002a). It has been found that different positions of the virus nucleic acid have different levels of resistance to chlorine and the inactivation effect of disinfectant on virus can be evaluated by PCR (Li et al., 2002a). Simonet and Gantzer (2006a) used this principle to investigate the influence of chlorine dioxide on extracted RNA and on the infectious poliovirus 1. RT-PCR was used to measure the degradation of genome fragments of different sizes and positions (76-base in the 3C region, 145-base fragment in the 5\u2032-untranslated region (5\u2032-UTR), 1869-base fragment in 3C region and 6989-base; nearly the entire viral genome). They found that general pattern of poliovirus 1 genome degradation decreased with decreasing fragment size (Simonet and Gantzer, 2006a). The study also revealed that relationship between degradation and size was not linear because degradation of 1869 bases of 3\u2032-terminal fragment (oligo dT primer for RT and 3C region primers for PCR) was as rapidly as the 5\u2032-UTR fragment with 145-bases (5\u2032-UTR primers for RT and PCR). Furthermore, the infectious poliovirus was very rapidly inactivated by 5 mg/l chlorine dioxide for 5 min, however, the drop-off was more than 3log10 for 6989-base fragment, which accounts for nearly the whole genome, and only 1.4 log10 for the 76-base fragment of 5\u2032-UTR.",

Although a linear correlation was observed between the rate of RNA degradation by UV and the fragment size, the size of the viral RNA was not the only factor affecting UV-induced RNA degradation. This was obvious since viral RNA was more rapidly degraded in poliovirus 1 than in the MS2 phage for a similar fragment size (Simonet and Gantzer, 2006b).",

The position and/or the sequence of the detected fragment also have to be considered in addition to the fragment size to avoid an overestimation of the risk of viral infection using PCR-based approach. Nevertheless, the efficiency of PCR based assays can be decreased owing to the presence of PCR-inhibitory compounds in the environmental water samples. More importantly, inactivation of viruses is also possible without damaging the viral genome. Enveloped viruses loose infectivity by degradation of surface proteins, in the absence of detergents the integrity of the viral genome is not affected. Similarly cross-linking agents can fix the virus particle and thus destroy their infectivity without damage to the viral genome. This somehow limits the general applicability of long target region PCR as a surrogate marker for viral infectivity.",

The method was used to evaluate the effectiveness of poliovirus inactivation by chlorine, so it could determine the potency of the chlorine disinfection, minimizing the chance of false-negative results due to single passage cell culture alone (Blackmer et al., 2000). Using this approach, the resistance of rotavirus to UV disinfection was demonstrated (Li et al., 2009). Li and his group compared ICC-qRT-PCR to conventional cell culture assay and qRT-PCR assay. The data obtained by ICC- qPCR provided more detailed assessment of virus resistance to UV disinfection at much wider dosage range compared to conventional cell culture assay. As a result, the authors pointed out that conventional cell culture assay may underestimate the UV dosage required to achieve certain level of inactivation (Li et al., 2009). At the same study, rotavirus genomes were found to be quite persistent under UV disinfection so the results of qRT-PCR did not correlate with virus infectivity. Similarly, ICC-qPCR method was proposed as a practical alternative for the quantification of adenoviruses in disinfection studies (Gerrity et al., 2008). Whereas, the detection reliability of indigenous viruses in environmental water samples by ICC-PCR can be restricted by the primer sets that are used (Lee and Jeong, 2004).",

Sensitive detection of infectious human adenoviruses by RT-PCR assay of mRNA followed by nested PCR was developed (Ko et al., 2003). HAdV 2 mRNA was detected as early as 6 h post-infection and HAdV 41 was detected 1 day after infection of A549 cells. In this approach the incubation time of samples on the cells depends on virus type, cell type, and target gene. Moreover, the authors modified the protocol by use of TaqMan real-time RT-PCR method in conjunction with cell culture infectivity to rapidly detect mRNA produced by infectious HAdV in water samples (Ko et al., 2005). Detection of HAdV mRNA in infected cells demonstrated that HAdV 41 is more resistant to UV radiation than in a previous study using a conventional cell culture infectivity assay.",

Nuanualsuwan and Cliver (2002) proposed the pre-treatment of virus containing water sample with proteinase K and RNase for the detection of the intact viral particles during three modes of virus inactivation; heat, ultraviolet and sodium hypochlorid. As a mean of preventing a positive RT-PCR test in the absence of infectious virus, Nuanualsuwan and Cliver showed that the intact viral capsids were less susceptible to protease degradation than the damaged capsid. Consequently, protease pre-treatment degrades the capsid damaged by disinfection, allowing the nuclease pre-treatment to degrade the unprotected nucleic (Nuanualsuwan and Cliver, 2002).",

EMA and PMA are closely related DNA intercalating dyes with a photo-inducible azide group that covalently cross-links to DNA after photo activation (Nocker et al., 2006). The dye can enter only bacterial cells with compromised cell walls and cell membranes (Rudi et al., 2005). Such modified DNA structure leads to a strong signal reduction in subsequent real-time PCR, as a result of PCR inhibition. However, few studies have found that EMA-PCR is a poor indicator of cell viability, since the use of EMA prior to DNA extraction may lead to a significant loss of the genomic DNA of some viable bacteria (Flekna et al., 2007). While, propidium monoazide (PMA) is a more selective agent, penetrating only dead bacterial cells but not viable cells with intact membranes (Nocker et al., 2006). In bacteria this approach could not monitor the loss of viability as a result of UV exposure, owing to UV light causes DNA damage without directly affecting membrane (Nocker et al., 2007).

Graiver et al. (2010) measured the survival rate of avian influenza viruses in water using cell culture titration and real time RT-PCR with and without EMA pre-treatment. Lower titres of viruses were obtained by cell culture than both RT-PCR procedures. Moreover, no significant differences were found between RT-PCR results with and without the EMA pre-treatment step, thus EMA may not bind effectively to RNA in inactive virions. It was also found that EMA may not bind effectively to extracted RNA from avian influenza viruses (Graiver et al., 2010). Although EMA did not distinguish between infectious and non-infectious avian influenza virus particles, the results of EMA-RT-PCR were comparable to the plaque assay of poliovirus 1 after thermal inactivation at 45 \u00b0C, 55 \u00b0C, 65 \u00b0C and 75 \u00b0C (Kim et al., 2011).

Nevertheless, PMA-RT-PCR was unable to prevent detection of norovirus and enteroviruses that were rendered non-infectious by treatment at 19 \u00b0C (Parshionikar et al., 2010). PMA-qPCR was not sufficiently effective to distinguish between infectious and non-infectious viruses even after heat inactivation (85 \u00b0C) and protease treatment (Fittipaldi et al., 2010) as shown in Fig. 3\n. Although the data from the PMA-qPCR method were in better agreement with the cell culture data than the qPCR, the PMA-qPCR method resulted in a positive signal amplification (Fittipaldi et al., 2010), which can yield false positives. In contrast, under higher inactivation temperature (110 \u00b0C), a clear discrimination of infectious and non-infectious viruses was observed with PMA-qPCR.",

Optimization of EMA or PMA concentration, time exposed to the light source, distance from the light source, and light source may lead to a more effective PMA/EMA pre-treatment. Likewise the pre-enzymatic treatment-PCR approach, PMA-(RT-)PCR and EMA-(RT-)PCR depend mainly on capsid integrity as the criterion for the infectivity, and this could be one of the drawbacks of this technique since virus inactivation may take place by means other than membrane or particle disruption. This was obvious when PMA-RT-PCR failed to discriminate between viruses that lost infectivity at 19 \u00b0C because their capsids did not allow penetration of PMA. In addition, the residual PMA/EMA may lead to PCR inhibition which needs extra purification steps before/after nucleic acids extraction.",

A fluorescence protein pair undergoing fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), in which fluorescence energy is transferred from an excited fluorophore (reporter) to a light-absorbing molecule (acceptor) when located in close proximity (Fig. 4\n). The reporter system of engineered BGMK cells was further combined with FC for the quantification of the infectious poliovirus. The number of infected cells was determined by counting the number of cells with an increased CFP-to-YFP ratio. As early as 5 h postinfection, a significant number of infected cells was detected by flow cytometry, and cells infected with only 1 PFU were detected after 12 h post-infection (Cantera et al., 2010). To demonstrate the potential of the FC-based assay for environmental applications, spiked water runoff sample with known titres of poliovirus 1 was used. They found that FC-based assay could provide a level of sensitivity similar to that of the plaque assay for detecting and quantifying infectious virus particles (Cantera et al., 2010).",

Smith and Gerba (1982) have shown that as few as 10 infectious units per liter can be reliably detected by IFA within less than 24 h incubation. Ridinger et al. (1982) found that IFA is more sensitive and more rapid than the plaque assay for the detection of reoviruses. Reoviruses in excess of 104 per liter of raw sewage were detected by IFA. During this study, the authors found that the efficiency of the assay depends mainly on the sensitivity of the cell line to the reoviruses. The comparison of IFA to the classical plaque assay showed that reoviruses detection could be possible within 10 h post-infection by IFA, whereas the formation of plaques requires 4\u20137 days.",

More recently, IFA was described by Calgua et al. (2011) to detect the infectious form of two most commonly detected viruses in water, HAdV and HPyV (Calgua et al., 2011). IFA was compared to the most commonly used methods for virus detection such as plaque assay, tissue culture infectious dose-50 (TCID50) and quantitative real time PCR. The IFA was found to be specific for the detection of infectious viruses. The method showed higher sensitivity for the detection of infectious viral particles than other cell culture techniques evaluated. Moreover, negative results were obtained by IFA when UV or heat-inactivated viruses were analyzed. Since the assay is based on the sensitivity of the cell type to virus infection, the optimal reading days for the IFAs were day 4 for HAdV 2 and day 8 for HAdV 41 and JCPyV. The developed IFA detected 1 log10 more infectious viruses for HAdV 2 than the plaque assay and TCID50. Also the values in focus-forming unit per ml obtained by the IFA were approximately 2 log10 less than the values in genome copies per ml obtained by qPCR (Calgua et al., 2011).",

In the presence of the target sequence, they unfold, bind and fluoresce. Yeh et al. (2008a) used hepatitis A virus as a surrogate for enteric viruses. The detection of infectious HAV with a detection limit of 1 PFU within 6 h post-infection was achieved so the reported fluorescence assay combines a 32-fold reduction in detection time with a quantitative capability similar to that for the 8-day conventional plaque assay for HAV at the same cells. Furthermore, the utility of the assay for the detection of HAV in surface water samples was demonstrated in parallel to plaque assay, showing that the infectious dosages obtained from the two assays were remarkably similar with a maximum of 25% difference (Yeh et al., 2008a).",

This could be due to the relatively short half-life (\u223c30 min) of MBs due to endogenous nuclease degradation. Thus, a modified protocol was proposed to use a nuclease-resistant MB containing 2\u2032-O-methyl RNA bases with phosphorothioate internucleotide linkages (Yeh et al., 2008b). To enhance the intracellular delivery, a cell-penetrating TAT peptide was conjugated to the MB by using a thiol\u2013maleimide linkage. When the conjugate was introduced into BGMK cell monolayers infected with coxsackievirus B6, a discernible fluorescence was observed within 30 min post-infection, and as few as 1 infectious viral particle could be detected within 2 h (Yeh et al., 2008b). This method is particularly attractive when applied to viruses that grow poorly in cell culture and those that do not produce detectable CPE in infected cells. While, it will probably not solve the problem of monitoring virus infectivity for viruses that do not infect cell cultures such as human noroviruses.",

A 5-fold increase of human norovirus recovered as oxidatively damaged particles after treatment with 1 ppm free chlorine for 15 min over viral particles that were treated with 0.5 ppm free chlorine for 15 min.

Different approaches such as enzymatic digestion, dye treatment prior nucleic acid extraction and direct detection of the oxidative lesions showed promising results to discriminate between infectious and non-infectious viral particles. However, virus inactivation may occur by mechanisms other than the disruption of the capsid protein and the mode of inactivation may be temperature dependent. Thus to differentiate between potentially infectious and non-infectious viruses more evaluations are still needed before interpretation of PCR results combined with dye or enzymatic pretreatment of virus suspension.",

It is obvious from the several approaches stated in this review that no single method can fulfil these criteria. Each method has drawbacks which prevent it from being optimal for routine lab work. Therefore, the development of new approaches is still needed. Next generation of detection of virus infectivity in environmental water samples may depend on the interesting, fast growing field of nanobiotechnology that has many applications in clinical diagnosis. The method has to provide high sensitivity, particularly few viral particles are expected to be found in contaminated environmental samples.",
