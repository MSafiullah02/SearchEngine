To clarify this issue, the term BOOP has now been replaced by the more accurate term of organizing pneumonia ( OP ) [ 3 ] . If OP occurs in association with an identifi ed cause or clinical condition, it is called secondary organizing pneumonia (SOP). If no cause is identifi ed, OP is termed cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP).

The most frequent complications were subclinical pneumothorax and minor hemoptysis, occurring in around 30 % of cases. As transthoracic needle biopsy usually provides larger tissue samples than transbronchial biopsy, it may constitute an alternative to surgical lung biopsy in some cases (Fig. 24.5b ) .

Therefore, preventing relapses by extending treatment duration appears unnecessary in most cases, and the strategy should rather aim at minimizing the adverse effects of corticosteroids. To avoid unnecessary concerns, the possible occurrence of relapses, and even multiple relapses, should be explained to the patient during tapering of prednisone for the initial episode.
