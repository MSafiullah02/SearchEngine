The main clinical feature is respiratory systems involvement, and additional gastrointestinal symptoms are also common Nicholls et al., 2003] . Severely affected patients develop acute respiratory distress syndrome, which corresponds with diffuse alveolar damage. This acute lung injury is a complex and multifunctional pathophysiological process involving inflammatory cytokines released from stimulated macrophages in the alveoli lead to dysregulation of the immune system [Nicholls et al., 2003] . Cytokine profiles in sera of SARS patients showed that interleukin (IL)-6 and interferon (IFN)-g, which promote inflammation by inducing cell injury, are significantly increased and the induction levels are closely correlated with the severity of SARS [Zhang et al., 2004; Huang et al., 2005] . It is well known that IL-6 induces the expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3), a negative regulator of IL-6 signaling, through gp130-mediated STAT3 phosphorylation/activation [Yasukawa et al., 2003 ]. On the other hand, IL-10, which leads to a reduction in lung tissue injury, was increased in convalescent SARS patients [Zhang et al., 2004] . These results indicated that severe immune response, rather than virus virulence, contributes to the progressive damage to the lung in SARS and that some cytokines may play an important role in the onset and pathogenesis of SARS . However, the regulation system of cytokine production and signaling during SARS-CoV infection is poorly understood.",

The IFN system is a powerful defense mechanism against virus infection. The system is divided into two processes, namely the IFN production process first, and subsequently the establishment of an antiviral state, which is due to IFNinducible proteins such as 2 0 , 5 0 -oligoadenylate synthetase (2-5AS), ds-RNA-acitivated protein kinase (PKR), IFN-stimulated gene 20 (ISG20), and Myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA) [Samuel, 1991; Sen and Ransohoff, 1993; Fujii, 1994; Gongora et al., 1997; Goodbourn et al., 2000] , through activation of IFN-JAK/STAT signaling pathway. The IFN production process consists of two steps, the former involves IFN-b production through activation of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) by the virus at an early stage infection and the latter is production of a large amount of IFN-a by primarily induced IFN-b through the formation of transcriptional heterodimer with IRF7 and IRF3 .",

            "text": "Many viruses are able to suppress the IFN system at various points. Suppression of IFN-b production or IFN-JAK/STAT signaling pathway results in reduction of IFN-a induction and antiviral function. It has been reported that influenza A virus (FluAV) and human parainfluenza virus type 2 (hPIV2) reduce IFN-b induction by suppression of IRF3 phosphorylation [Talon et al., 2000; Poole et al., 2002] . Furthermore, hPIV2 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) counteracts IFN signaling by degradation of STAT2 [Andrejeva et al., 2002; Ramaswamy et al., 2004] . Therefore, the effect of IFN on the replication of these viruses is diminished. In contrast, IFN is a favored candidate as a therapeutic agent of SARS, exhibiting anti-SARS-CoV activity in in vitro experiments and in in vivo treatment trials [Zhao et al., 2003; Cinatl et al., 2004; Sainz et al., 2004; Morgenstern et al., 2005] . From lines of evidence, SARS-CoV seems to be sensitive to IFN. It is important to clarify the influence of SARS-CoV upon the IFN system, namely suppression of IFN production and counteraction of IFN signaling by SARS-CoV infection, because many viruses have evolved a variety of strategies to counteract the antiviral effect of IFN.",

Indeed, investigation of SOCS3 induction level is crucial because this factor acts as a negative regulator in IL-6 signaling.

However, it is still unclear whether SARS-CoV is able to induce several types of IFN. To investigate IFN-inducibility by SARS-CoV infection, we compared expression levels of several IFNs (IFN-a1, IFN-a2, IFN-b, IFN-l1, IFN-l2) mRNA in SARS-CoV infected cells with those in other viruses, RSV, FluAV, and hPIV2 infected cells. Viral infected cells were harvested to isolate cellular RNA after appearance of CPE caused by infected virus. As shown in Figure 2 , all types of IFNs were little induced by hPIV2. Furthermore, little (IFN-l1 and IFN-l2) or lower levels (IFN-a and IFN-b) of IFNs induction was found in FluAV infected Caco2 cells. Indeed, in bioassay system, we cannot detect IFN activity in culture medium from FluAV and hPIV2 infected cells. In contrast, significant levels of IFN-a, IFN-b, and IFN-l mRNA were detectable in SARS-CoV and RSV infected cells, and 2-32 IU/ml of IFN activity was recognized in culture medium of these viruses infected cells. The expression level of IFN-b mRNA by SARS-CoV was always higher than that in RSV infection. Induction of IFN-b and subsequent expression of IRF7 is an essential process to produce IFN-a. We found that IRF7 expression level in SARS-CoV and RSV infected cells was significantly higher than in other respiratory virus infections. These differences in IRF7 expression levels among viruses seemed to correlate with the level of IFNs production, including IFN-ls. However, a small amount of IFN-as was induced in FluAV infection, although no IRF7 was induced. The IFN-a induction may be due to activation of IRF5, which contributes to IFN-a induction independently from IRF7 pathway [Island et al., 2002] . Furthermore, there was a correlation between production of IFNs and expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), 2-5AS, ISG20, and MxA. Expression of ISGs in SARS-CoV and RSV infected cells was higher than it was in FluAV and hPIV2 infected cells. The low level of ISGs induction in FluAV may be caused by a low titer (no detection in bioassay system) of secreted IFN in culture medium.",

The mRNA levels of ISGs in uninfected Caco2 increased by treatment with IFN-a or IFN-b for 4 hr (Fig. 3, control) . After infection of the cells with SARS-CoV for 2 days, the infected cells were treated with IFN-a or IFN-b for 4 hr. As shown in Figure 3 , mRNA induction levels of ISGs in the infected cells were similar to those in uninfected cells treated with IFNs. In contrast, these ISGs 'mRNAs were not induced by IFN treatment in hPIV2 infected cells (data not shown) due to suppression of IFN signaling pathway. These results show that SARS-CoV did not have counteracting strategies against establishment of IFNinduced antiviral state (IFN signaling).

To clarify the characteristics of cytokine induction profile in cells infected with SARS-CoV, we compared the mRNA induction pattern of cytokines in SARS-CoV with those in other respiratory viruses. Expression of IL-8 increased in all the viral infections examined, and the levels were almost the same among these viruses (about 10-35 ng/ml of protein level), with exception of FluAV (Fig. 5) . Another chemokine, regulated upon activation normally T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) was also induced during SARS-CoV and RSV infections J. Med. Virol. DOI 10.1002/jmv (about 1.0-10 ng/ml of protein level), whereas it was not detectable in FluAV and hPIV2 infections. Similarly to RANTES, proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 was dramatically increased to identical levels in both SARS-CoV and RSV infections (about 1.0-2.0 ng/ml of protein level), but not in FluAV and hPIV2 infections. In contrast, UV-inactivated SARS-CoV (Fig. 5 ) and RSV (data not shown) were not able to induce IL-6 mRNA expression.

These factors are also induced in response to stimulation by appropriate cytokines, including IL-6 or IFNs via JAK/STAT signaling pathway. In the case of IL-6, Jak-1, Jak-2, and Tyk-2 are tyrosine kinases recruited to the gp130 receptor of IL-6, and these in turn activate the STAT3 to induce feedback inhibitor SOCS3, which acts as a negative regulator of IL-6 signaling . SOCS3 is, therefore, important for normal IL-6 signal transduction pathway. Less induction of SOCS3 results in continuous activa-tion of STAT3, and leads to enhanced and prolonged IL-6 signaling. It is crucial to investigate the induction levels of SOCS3 in SARS-CoV and RSV infected cells. The expression of SOCS3 mRNA was detected in both of these virus infected cells. The level of SOCS3 in RSV infection was remarkably higher than in SARS-CoV infection (Fig. 5) . No expression of SOCS3 was found in FluAV and hPIV2 infections, which produced no IL-6. Another specific negative regulator for STAT5 signaling pathway, cytokine-inducible SH2 protein (CIS), was also found in only RSV infection (Fig. 5) [Yoshimura, 1998] . These results indicate that dysfunction of the negative feedback system of cytokine signaling bring about strong induction of inflammatory reaction.",

The multifunctional NS1 protein of FluAV and V protein of hPIV2 inhibit activation of IRF3, followed by suppression of IFN-b production [Talon et al., 2000; Poole et al., 2002] . Human PIV2 counteracts IFN signaling by degradation of STAT2 [Andrejeva et al., 2002] . Because of the limited production of IFN-b and dysfunction of JAK/STAT signaling pathway, the subsequent expression of ISGs were undetectable in hPIV2 (Fig. 2) . In contrast, the results from Figures 2 and 3 show that IFN system (IFN production and IFN signaling pathway) is not suppressed at all in SARS-CoV infection. This is also confirmed by treatment of SARS-CoV infected cells with exogenous IFN (Fig. 3) . However, it has been reported that there was little or no induction of beta IFN in SARS-CoV infected macrophages [Cheung et al., 2005] . Recently, Spiegel et al. [2005] , noted that SARS-CoV appears to block a step after the early nuclear transport of IRF3 in human 293 cells. These results for IFN-b Caco2 cells were pretreated with 1,000 IU/ml of IFN-a or IFN-b for 24 hr, and then the cells were washed and infected with SARS-CoV. After cultivation for 2 days, the culture mediums were harvested to determined virus titer. Virus yields of SARS-CoV were calculated as a 50% tissue culture infectious dose.",

Because of little contribution of SARS-CoV on IFN signaling, IFN is considered to be a suitable candidate for treatment of SARS-CoV infection. Though the efficiency of IFN treatment of SARS patients cannot be ascertained [Zhao et al., 2003; Fujii et al., 2004] , some in vitro experiments showed significant affect of IFN against SARS-CoV replication [Cinatl et al., 2004; Lund et al., 2004; Sainz et al., 2004] . We also confirmed a higher antiviral effect with IFN-b than with IFN-a ( Fig. 4 and Table II ). There are two distinct results subsequent to suppression of IFN signaling pathway by RSV infection. Young et al. [2000] , reported that RSV is able to circumvent the anti-viral functions of IFN and replicate in human cells that produce and respond to IFN without blocking of IFN signaling. In contrast, Ramaswamy et al., noted that RSV acts on epithelial cells derived from airway to modulate (inhibit) IFN signal transduction. This effect is likely mediated through proteasome-dependent degradation of STAT2 [Ramaswamy et al., 2004] . Our results showed that induction of ISGs is not suppressed by RSV infection (Fig. 2) , suggesting that RSV does not inhibit IFN signaling pathway. Our data in this experiment supported the result reported by Young et al. However, the reason for the discrepancy with Ramaswamy et al.'s findings is not known.",

Increased expression of IL-6 and RANTES was found in SARS-CoV and RSV infections, but not in FluAV or hPIV2. Overexpression of IL-6 was reported in patients with SARS-CoV and RSV [Hornsleth et al., 1998; Zhang et al., 2004] . RSV infection causes more severe respiratory symptoms compared to infections with FluAV and hPIV2, and the serum concentration levels of IL-6, IL-8, and RANTES correlate with the symptom scores [Sung et al., 2001; Gern et al., 2002] . IL-8 and RANTES, potent neutrophil attractant and activator, has been shown to be elevated in blood and alveolar spaces [Chollet-Martin et al., 1996] and exhibit a positive correlation with the number of these chemokine in patients with pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome [Villard et al., 1995] . Therefore, these chemokines induced by SARS-CoV may also play role in the accumulation of hemophagocytosis in the lung and development of subsequent wheezing after SARS-CoV infection, and contribute to symptom severity of SARS.",

This is likely what contributes to the onset of severe respiratory symptoms as compared with FluAV and hPIV2 infection. However, clinical signs or symptoms of SARS-CoV infection are more ''severe'' than those of RSV infection. What differences are there in inflammatory responses between SARS-CoV and RSV? We found a difference in induction of a negative regulator of cytokine signaling, SOCS family. The induced level of SOCS3 mRNA during SARS-CoV infection was clearly lower than that in RSV infection. IL-6 transcriptionally activates various genes contributing to inflammatory responses. The negative factor SOCS3 participates in the feedback system of IL-6 signal transduction by binding to phosphorylated tyrosine residue of a component of IL-6 receptor gp130 [Yasukawa et al., 2003] . Therefore, suppressed SOCS3 expression in SARS-CoV infected Caco2 cells might lead to continuous activation of STAT3, and prolonged and enhanced IL-6 signaling. Less induction of SOCS3 contributes to dysregulation of inflammatory signaling and increases the severity of inflammation in SARS-CoV infection.",

The inactivation of STAT3 may contribute to less induction of SOCS3 in SARS-CoV infection. It is, therefore, important to investigate the influence of SARS-CoV on phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of STAT3. In addition, there is a possibility of a direct affect on the promoter region of SOCS3 gene in SARS-CoV infection.

Downregulation of appropriate cytokine signaling by feedback regulators, SOCS families, is thought to play an important role in the balance of cytokine signaling, thus contributing to the onset of Th1 and Th2 mediated immune response. Expression of SOCS3 correlates with the pathology of Th2 mediated allergic immune diseases such as atopic dermatitis and asthma [Seki et al., 2003 ]. Many epidemiological studies indicate possible linkages between RSV infection in childhood and subsequent manifestations of atopy and asthma [Sigurs et al., 2000; Holt and Sly, 2002] . The strong induction of SOCS3 by RSV could be a causative factor of atopy and asthma. Studies are underway to investigate the correlation between SOCS3 induction and cytokine regulation during RSV infection in FL and A549 cells, because we cannot detect SOCS3 protein in Caco2 cells infected with RSV and treated with IL-6. Difficulty of protein detection (SOCS3) is thought to be dependent on cell types, but not on SARS-CoV. In addition, other members of SOCS family, SOCS1 and CIS were also investigated in these viruses infected Caco2 cells. All of the viruses failed to express SOCS1, and only RSV was able to induce CIS (Fig. 5) . Therefore, SOCS3 and CIS play an important role in inflammatory system in RSV infection.",

The enhanced interaction between TLRs and some microbial substances has the potential to profoundly alter the grade of inflammation. Indeed upregulated TLR4 by RSV infection leads to increased binding of LPS to airway epithelium and enhanced inflammatory reaction [Monick et al., 2003] . Therefore, it is suggested that SARS-CoV and RSV infections enhance epithelial inflammatory response to some inhalant microbial substances by upregulated TLRs.",
