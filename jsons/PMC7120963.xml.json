Transplant is absolutely contraindicated in patients with uncontrollable infections or those who have been diagnosed with a malignancy within the preceding 2 years. Candidates with a BMI >35 or any substance dependency to include smoking, alcohol, or illicit drug use are also disqualified. Lung transplant is typically avoided in patients older than 65 who have low physiologic reserve and patients colonized with particularly virulent or resistant pathogens as outcomes tend to be poor [73].",

The perfect lung donor is young (age <55) and with physiologically normal lung tissue. However, liberalization of strict criteria has been accepted to increase the donor pool. Final decisions on prospective donor candidates are usually determined by the operating surgeon [75]. Potential donors from patients with brain death should be managed in such a way that their left ventricular ejection fraction remains above 45% and mean arterial pressure should be maintained at 60 mmHg with a central venous pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure no higher than 8 and 12 mmHg, respectively. There is no level-one evidence to support a specific type of fluid over another; however, intuitively colloids may help minimize pulmonary edema . Acidosis should be corrected if pH is less than 7.2, and this may be accomplished with hyperventilation or the addition of bicarbonate solutions to resuscitative fluids. Most transplant surgeons prefer lung protective strategies for ventilation as this has been shown to increase donor eligibility [76]. Finally, donor lung function may be improved with the administration of methyl prednisone by way of decreasing pulmonary edema [77].",

As such, the surgical technique used for the creation of the bronchial anastomosis is an area that has been thoroughly evaluated for lung transplant. Currently, the preferred method involves an end-to-end anastomosis that no longer incorporates coverage with an omental flap or a bronchial artery anastomosis [94, 95]. This technique has led to the lowest reported airway complication rates in pulmonary transplant history, but airway complications still represent the most common postoperative complication with rates as high as 18%. Bronchial necrosis, due to a relative decrease in blood supply, is seen to some degree in nearly all post-op lung transplant patients. The effects of necrosis can range from sloughing of the mucosa to total anastomotic dehiscence [96].",

A CT scan of chest usually confirms the diagnosis. Fistulae communication with a vessel may present with hemoptysis and signs of sepsis. Fistulae development represents a difficult problem with no one right answer. Drainage of any fluid collections and the initiation of appropriate antibiotics are imperative.

When prolonged ventilator support is required, lung protective strategies using lower tidal volumes and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) should be employed [101]. However, there are some caveats in lung transplant populations. Those receiving transplant for pulmonary hypertension should remain intubated for the first 24 h at minimum to best address any hypoxia or hemodynamic instability [101]. Minimal amounts limited to only physiologic levels of PEEP should be utilized in patients undergoing single-lung transplant. This is particularly true when transplant is performed for predominantly obstructive disease pattern as the use of PEEP can cause overinflation of the remaining native lung [101]. Hypoxia despite appropriate ventilator support should be swiftly evaluated keeping in mind that PGD is the most common cause of hypoxia post-lung transplant.",

Arguably, this begins intraoperatively with the stress dosing of steroids administered just prior to perfusion of the new lung. Induction therapies are generally tailored on a patient-by-patient basis. The mechanism of action for these agents is by either inhibition of the effects of IL-2 or directly inhibition of T lymphocytes. A list of potential agents and associated side effects are listed in Table 20.2. There is no consensus on whether induction therapy should be routinely used and no conclusive studies supporting one agent over another. Some evidence does suggest a slight increase in survival in the first 2 weeks following transplant based on reports from the ISHLT looking at all transplants done in 2014 [82]. The same registry provides evidence that rejection within the first year may be lower in patients who received induction therapy when compared to no induction therapy (26% vs 34%, respectively) [82].
