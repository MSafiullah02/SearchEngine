            "text": "Chagas disease, also known as American Trypanosomiasis, is caused by infection with the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi (WHO, 1991). More than 10 million people carry the protozoan organism T. cruzi, which multiplies inside cells, particularly of heart and smooth muscle (WHO, 2002a, WHO, 2002b). Chagas disease has a broad spectrum of clinical presentations, ranging from asymptomatic infections to life-threatening cardiac and digestive disease. The type of clinical presentation varies by geographical region (Prata, 2001). Following the acute phase, patients enter the chronic phase. Up to 20 years after the initial infection, \u223c35% of infected people develop pathological signs characteristic of Chagas disease. Autoimmunity, granulocytic cell activation, tissue damage caused by T. cruzi, neurogenic factors, and microvascular disturbance have been reported in association with the development of the chronic features of the disease (Kierszenbaum, 1999). The mechanisms responsible for the susceptibility to infection and the clinical heterogeneity observed among infected individuals are not well understood, but substantial evidence suggests that differences in the expression of genes related to the immune response may be involved.",

            "text": "Interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) is a multifunctional cytokine, which is produced by effector T and natural killer cells. IFN-\u03b3 controls the development of T helper 1 (Th1) cells and is critical for host defence against a variety of intracellular pathogens, including T. cruzi infection (Silva et al., 1992, Torrico et al., 1991). The human IFNG gene on chromosome 12q24.1 spans 5.4 kb and contains four exons that encode a 146-aa protein. Several polymorphisms within the IFNG non-coding regions, such as +874A/T, CA repeat microsatellite and \u2212179T/G, have been implicated in numerous autoimmune and chronic inflammatory conditions (Chong et al., 2006, Pacheco et al., 2008, Pravica et al., 2000). A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the first intron of the human IFNG gene at the 5\u2032 end, adjacent to a CA repeat region (+874T/A polymorphism rs2430561), can influence the secretion of IFN-\u03b3 (Pravica et al., 2000). Analysis of the biological role of this SNP suggested that +874A allele carriers are low IFN-\u03b3 producers (Lopez-Maderuelo et al., 2003). Susceptibility to other infectious diseases like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have also been described (Chong et al., 2006) suggesting that variability in IFN-\u03b3 production linked to this SNP is possibly playing a major role in susceptibility to infectious diseases, especially intracellular pathogens. Due to this, we selected the +874T/A polymorphism of IFNG to assess the potential association of this SNP in the susceptibility and/or clinical features of Chagas disease in a Colombian population from an endemic area.",

The serological diagnosis was based on results of two independent tests, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and indirect hemagglutination test (WHO, 2002a, WHO, 2002b). Patients were classified according to clinical and electrocardiographic characteristics. Those without cardiac symptoms (n\n = 116) and with a normal electrocardiogram (ECG) were classified as asymptomatic. Patients that by clinical evaluation, ECG, Holter monitoring (24 h) and echocardiogram showed conduction alterations and/or structural cardiomyopathy were included in the cardiomyopathic or symptomatic group (n\n = 120) as follows: CC II (n\n = 20, radiology indicative of light heart hypertrophy or minor ECG alterations), CC III (n\n = 80, moderate heart hypertrophy and considerable ECG alterations, mainly advanced conduction abnormalities) and CC IV (n\n = 20, severe cardiomegaly and marked ECG alterations, predominantly frequent and/or complex forms of ventricular arrhythmia) (Rocha et al., 2003). All the individuals are from the same geographic region and have been living there for more than 10 years and they shared the same environmental and socioeconomic living conditions. The population from this region is homogeneous and there is not concentration of ethnical groups such as indigenous or black population.

Resistance to acute infection with T. cruzi has been shown to be dependent on IFN-\u03b3, which activates macrophages to produce nitric oxide (NO) and kill the obligate intracellular amastigote form of the parasite (Torrico et al., 1991). In addition, TNF-\u03b1 provides a second signal that stimulates NO production and anti-T. cruzi activity in IFN-\u03b3-activated macrophages (Silva et al., 1992). This mechanism would explain the higher susceptibility to T. cruzi infection among individuals carrying the A allele compared with individuals carrying the \u201cT\u201d allele. Similar results have been reported for other infectious diseases, such as pulmonary tuberculosis and severe acute respiratory syndrome (Chong et al., 2006, Lopez-Maderuelo et al., 2003).",

Contrary to expectations, no significant differences were observed in the distribution of alleles or genotypes of the IFNG +874T/A polymorphism between cardiomyopathic and asymptomatic patients with Chagas disease, indicating no influence of this polymorphism on Chagas disease progression. A larger sample size may be required in order to establish whether a cause-effect association exists between this polymorphism and to development of cardiomyopathy. Consistent with our result, D\u2019Avila et al. (2009) found no difference in IFN-\u03b3 production between cardiac and asymptomatic patients. Complex interactions take place following parasite infection, predicting that the clinical course of the disease cannot be explained by a single mechanism. Consistent with this prediction, interleukin IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 are associated with susceptibility to infection (Cardillo et al., 1996) by inhibiting IFN-\u03b3-mediated macrophage activation. Therefore, not only the presence of IFN-\u03b3, per se, but also the secretion levels of others cytokines (e.g., IL-4, IL-10, TGF-\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1) constitute key factors in the immunoregulation of the host\u2013parasite relationship (Gomes et al., 2003, Martin et al., 2007, Rodriguez-Perez et al., 2005).",
