Indeed, the systematic assembly of chemical building blocks to form potential biologically-active compounds and their rapid testing for bioactivity has experienced a rapid growth in both experimental and theoretical approaches (e.g., [640, 692, 1241]); see the editorial overview on combinatorial chemistry [207] and the associated group of articles. Two combinatorial chemistry journals were launched in 1997, with new journals since then, and a Gordon Research conference on Combinatorial Chemistry was created. The number of new-drug candidates reaching the clinical-trial stage is greater than ever. Indeed, it was stated in 1999: \u201cRecent advances in solid-phase synthesis, informatics, and high-throughput screening suggest combinatorial chemistry is coming of age\u201d [151].",

These tools can be applied to propose candidate molecules that resemble antibiotics, to find novel catalysts for certain reactions,to design inhibitors for the HIV protease, or to construct molecular sieves for the chemical industries based on zeolites. Thus, combinatorial technology is used to develop not only new drugs but also new materials, such as for electronic devices. Indeed, as electronic instruments become smaller, thin insulating materials for integrated circuit technology are needed. For example, the design of a new thin-film insulator at Bell Labs of Lucent Technologies [333] combined an optimal mixture of the metals zirconium (Zr), tin (Sn), and titanium (Ti) with oxygen.",

(This work was performed in collaboration with Merck Research Laboratories). The accuracy of this projection (the percentage of distances satisfying eq. (15.31) for \u03b7 = 0. 1) is only 0.2% after PCA and 24.8% after PCA/TNPACK. Figure 15.7 shows that compounds close in the projection appear similar, and Figure 15.8 shows that more distantly related compounds tend to be different. Without knowing the grouping of these compounds according to bioactivity, the clusters identified in Figure 15.8 suggest a \u2018diversity subset\u2019 consisting of a few members from each cluster.\n\n",
