Viruses are being developed to treat cancer using two contrasting approaches. The initial approach was to use replication-incompetent viruses as delivery vehicles for therapeutic genes.1,2 A contrasting strategy has now emerged to use replication-selective viruses as therapeutic agents themselves.3,4,5,6,7 These viruses replicate in and destroy cancer cells directly, without the addition of exogenous genes. Superior efficacy may eventually be achieved by combining these two strategies and arming replication-selective viruses with therapeutic transgenes.7,8,9 Unfortunately, to date, the published clinical experience with these agents has been limited to intratumoral injection on phase I studies. In addition, data from an adenoviral gene therapy trial for ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency at the University of Pennsylvania has raised questions about the safety of arterial adenovirus administration.10,11,12,13",

Although durable responses were rare as a single agent in these advanced refractory tumors,23 a potentially synergistic interaction was subsequently discovered between ONYX-015 and chemotherapy.24,25,26,27 While all recurrent head and neck cancer patients on the combination viral and chemotherapy clinical trial received intravenous chemotherapy (cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil), the response rate of tumors injected with ONYX-015 was significantly higher than in tumors that were not injected.24 Further development of ONYX-015 is indicated in combination with chemotherapy.",

However, most cancers that fail surgery and/or radiation are multifocal; clinically beneficial intralesional therapy is therefore not feasible in the majority of cancer patients. For viral agents to have significant benefit in these advanced cancer patients, regional or systemic delivery of viruses to tumors through the vasculature is necessary. The intravascular administration of genetically engineered replication-selective viruses in humans has not been previously described.3,4,5,6,7 Potential hurdles to intravascular therapy include virally mediated inflammatory hepatitis, antibody-mediated neutralization of the virus, rapid clearance of the virus from the bloodstream by reticuloendothelial organs and limited viral deposition within tumor masses. Intravenous administration of ONYX-015 in nude mouse\u2013human tumor xenograft models led to infection and growth inhibition of distant tumors in a dose-dependent fashion.28 The dose-limiting toxicity in this model was hepatic necrosis. However, the available animal models could not adequately assess the role of the immune response to the adenovirus, nor the risk of replication-dependent toxicities within normal tissues. Clinical data on intravascular administration of adenoviruses has been eagerly awaited.",

These patients were selected for intra-arterial treatment for several reasons. First, intrahepatic tumor progression is the cause of death in over 80% of the roughly 50 000 patients dying with colorectal carcinoma in the United States every year, and it is estimated that 30\u201340% of patients dying of colorectal cancer will have macroscopic disease confined to the liver.29 Second, preferential perfusion of tumor masses (versus normal liver tissue) can be achieved via hepatic artery infusions.29 Finally, new treatments for colorectal carcinoma are needed. At the time of study initiation, the standard first-line therapy for advanced colon cancer was 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in combination with leucovorin (LV); irinotecan and oxaliplatin were used following 5-FU failure or in combination with 5-FU as first-line therapy. In numerous well-controlled trials, the response rate for 5-FU/LV is in the range of 10 to 25% with few complete responses and little impact on overall survival.30 Therefore, experimental regional therapies utilizing hepatic artery infusion have been developed for colorectal liver metastases.29 The treatment on this trial included two doses of ONYX-015 by hepatic artery infusion as a single agent followed by combination treatment with intravenous 5-FU and LV (Figure 1). We have now demonstrated that intravascular administration of a replication-selective adenovirus is feasible and well-tolerated, both as a single agent and in combination with standard 5-FU and LV chemotherapy. Antitumoral activity was demonstrated in combination with 5-FU in a 5-FU-refractory patient.",

The feasibility and safety of this treatment approach was demonstrated. This is the first report describing intravascular administration of genetically engineered, replication-selective virus in patients. The primary study endpoints were to determine the safety of intravascular infusion, alone and in combination with intravenous 5-FU/LV, and the feasibility of infecting metastatic tumors by this route of administration with an attenuated adenovirus. Secondary endpoints included assessment of the humoral immune response and antitumoral activity (assessable on combination therapy only). The hepatic arterial infusion of ONYX-015 was well-tolerated at doses up to 2 \u00d7 1012 particles (1011 p.f.u.). The dose of 2 \u00d7 1012 particles was the highest practical dose given manufacturing capacity at the time of this study. Mild to moderate fever and rigors were the most common adverse events, and these were transient and not dose-limiting. Despite the dose-limiting liver toxicity identified in mice,28 dose-limiting liver toxicity did not occur in these patients at these doses. Transient, mild to moderate transaminitis was documented occasionally at the highest doses. Therefore, hepatic arterial infusion of this E1B-55kD gene-deleted adenovirus was well-tolerated both as a single agent and in combination with 5-FU. Viral replication occurred at high doses in patients without neutralizing antibodies present at baseline. This study has major implications regarding the safety of adenovirus administration into the blood, particularly in the wake of the unfortunate death of a patient treated with a replication-incompetent adenovirus into the hepatic artery for ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency. Adenovirus administration into the blood does not appear to be inherently dangerous. Importantly, this lack of significant toxicity was demonstrated at doses that resulted in the infection of tumors and in antitumoral activity.",

By report, in less than 24 h the patient experienced hyperammonemia, adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and disseminated intravascular coagulation; this was followed over the next few days by multi-organ system failure and death.10 On this trial we observed none of these complications. Several factors may account for these relative differences in safety. One plausible explanation is that the patient populations enrolled on to these two trials differed in their sensitivity to viral infection and the ensuing systemic inflammatory response. It is well-documented that patients with OTC deficiency have a heightened sensitivity to viral and bacterial infections compared with the general population, and that hyperammonemia, ARDS and death can result.31 Unfortunately, the OTC patient reportedly had an elevated blood ammonia level before treatment on the trial. We have observed high-level induction of both interleukin-1 and -6, for example, following dl1520 administration, consistent with an adenovirus-induced systemic inflammatory response (T Reid, personal commu- nication). This sort of inflammation may not be tolerated in OTC patients. A second contributing factor to safety differences may have been that the viral doses tested on this study were approximately 10-fold lower. However, viral replication on this study probably led to longer term adenoviral exposure and shedding into the bloodstream than on the OTC trial with a replication-deficient adenovirus. In addition, five patients on a separate trial have now been treated intravenously with dl1520 at doses of 2 \u00d7 1012 to 2 \u00d7 1013 particles; these doses are up to 10-fold higher than on this trial and are close to those used before the fatal event in the OTC trial.37 None of the complications that occurred in the OTC patient occurred in these patients. Finally, differences in the viruses themselves may have contributed, although the protein coats of the viral particles were identical on each study. Based on this study, it is clear that adenoviruses, including replication-selective adenoviruses, can be safely administered into the bloodstream at doses that have biological activity against metastatic carcinoma.",

            "text": "The dose-limiting toxicity of serotype 5 adenovirus in mice is hepatic necrosis.28 This hepatotoxicity can be demonstrated with both replication-defective or replication-deficient adenoviruses, although the LD50 with replication-competent adenovirus is significantly lower. This hepatotoxicity is dependent on tumor necrosis factor receptor expression (although tumor necrosis factor may not be the relevant ligand since it is not required for the toxicity to occur). The LD50 seen with dl1520 after tail vein injection in mice was approximately 6 \u00d7 1010 particles. Based on allometric scaling, the lethal dose in a human would be predicted to be 6 \u00d7 1013 particles. However, rodent toxicity models are suboptimal because these animals are not fully permissive for human adenovirus replication. In addition, the relative expression of coxsackie-adenovirus receptor (CAR) differs between the human and the mouse in some organs.32 Humans have higher relative receptor levels in the heart and lower relative levels in the liver, for example. The lack of clinically significant liver toxicity on this trial was encouraging. Transient low-grade transaminitis was demonstrated in some patients in the high-dose group, as was a single case of transient grade III hyperbilirubinemia. It is possible that clinically significant liver toxicity could occur at higher viral doses. On a separate trial, five patients were treated intravenously with dl1520 at doses of 2 \u00d7 1012 to 2 \u00d7 1013 particles (ie at doses up to 10-fold higher than on this trial).37 Similar grade I\u2013II transaminitis was demonstrated, but no clinically significant hepatotoxicity or other toxicity was encountered. With improvements in manufacturing, future trials may therefore explore higher doses of adenoviruses in patients with metastatic and treatment-refractory carcinoma in order to determine the maximally tolerated dose by this route of administration; dose escalation would need to proceed cautiously at these high doses, but higher doses may result in enhanced antitumoral efficacy.",

In combination with 5-FU and LV, dose-related antitumoral activity was demonstrated. Of note, a partial tumor response was demonstrated in a patient who was refractory to both 5-FU-based chemotherapy and to ONYX-015 administered separately; this is suggestive of a potential synergy between these agents. In addition, a patient failing lower dose virus plus chemotherapy subsequently underwent shrinkage (35% decrease) on high-dose virus plus chemotherapy. These findings are consistent with evidence of chemosensitization following intratumoral injection of ONYX-015 in head and neck cancer clinical trials.24 In preclinical studies, we have shown that this interaction is dependent on viral replication and on the sequencing of the agents. Studies are underway to determine the role of inflammatory cytokines and specific viral gene products (eg E1A) in this interaction.35,36 Combination therapy with replication-selective adenoviruses and chemotherapy holds promise. Tumor cross-resistance is unlikely with agents working through such radically different mechanisms, and the combination has been well-tolerated to date due to a lack of overlapping toxicities. Efficacy trials exploring this combination therapy approach are indicated. Now that safety of the combination has been suggested, viral therapy and chemotherapy may be initiated together on cycle 1 in the future.",
