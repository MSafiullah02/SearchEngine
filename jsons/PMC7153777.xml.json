This decreases the chance for our patients, that are often immune-suppressed by their disease, steroids, radiotherapy or chemotherapy, to be exposed to COVID-19 but definitely their quality of life is significantly affected by the fear of facing this pandemic with an immune system that is significantly weakened.",

A few days ago, while going to work, I met the caretaker of our building and had a chat with him: he mentioned to me that he and other inhabitants of the building felt safer because I was there and could help in case of emergency or just try to explain what was going on and, above all, make predictions as to the end of this situation or at least regarding its improvement. This role, our role is, of course, also important at home, with family members, with friends and sometimes with just bystanders. We have to champion the scientific approach: discourage the idea that COVID-19 is the result of a conspiracy, or even of bad science; trust in laboratory work (and, yes, animal experiments too!) aimed at identifying a vaccine (by the way, everyone who was anti-vax has strangely disappeared just recently); provide understandable explanations on numbers and graphs that each day are submerging us, from whatever source, be it the television, newspapers the web or the social media.",

We did good things in Lombardy but we also made mistakes, and we and others will hopefully learn from these mistakes. One for all: avoid transforming hospitals into the problem rather than the remedy. Hospitalize patients that really need it and, above all, check all the operators with swabs, even if asymptomatic. They might be so because of their immune system, which for reasons now unknown is particularly fit to fight COVID-19, but the contagion to other unfit bystanders could become dangerous, even lethal. And now that the number of infected people may be platooning (here, of course), we need to set up reliable assays to determine IgM and IgG levels in the peripheral blood of people exposed to the virus. Once identified, these people will be the first to be able to come back to work and semi-normal life: which is absolutely necessary if we want to avoid, after a medical disaster, a social and economic disaster in our society.",
