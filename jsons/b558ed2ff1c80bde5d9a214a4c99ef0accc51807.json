As a consequence, on August 7, the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) declared a National Emergency on Ebola. The Nigerian President also earmarked 1.9b Naira (around $11m) for containment strategies following an approved Special Intervention Plan (SIP) to further strengthen on-going steps to contain the virus.

The SIP includes active Ebola surveillance through contact tracing, temperature examination at international airports for outbound and inbound passengers, establishment of isolation centers, procurement of required equipment and deployment of staff. A similar emergency was declared in Liberia, where schools and borders were closed and $18m earmarked to facilitate containment strategies. The state government of Lagos reacted sharply, knowing that EVD is a dire health emergency. There was a press conference involving neighboring states.

One of the vital recommendations of WHO (2014b) was that there should be a large-scale and sustained effort to fully engage the community to play a key role in case identification, contact tracing and risk education.

Nigeria, through the Minister of Health, made a request for the experimental drug, which, for several reasons, was turned down by the USA. Although there were still pertinent ethical questions regarding the use of the drug, many health experts advocated for the experimental drugs to be provided to the affected African countries. However, the USA argued that, as they were only treating two patients at the time, in the event of serious adverse events, the damage would be very minimal in terms of causalities or fatalities (and related unexpected consequences). If such a drug was widely used in regions with thousands of cases, the situation could be worse. There was still the need to assess the drugs in terms of unexpected events, dosage, and adverse events. More importantly, the supply was still not adequate to meet the demands of the Ebola-affected countries.

This was an effort to stop additional imported case. As the number of victims grew, so did the possibility that other countries would also suspend receiving flights from Nigeria. This would have placed a great burden on Nigeria, since it has a huge population flying daily into several countries of the world.

The peculiarities of infectious disease often make the entire world to be greatly apprehensive. An occurrence in one country could easily transmit to another country if not effectively managed and safeguarded. Such diseases often attract major news headlines across the world, and thus become a global issue. And while a number of countries might be setting up control or treatment measures, others will be immersed in protective frameworks. The apprehension often moves from the political to the social level (especially at the level of the individual), following perceived possibility of transmissions. Smith et al. (2004: 2) assert that \"[T]he individual fear and community panic associated with infectious diseases often leads to rapid, emotionally driven decision making about public health policies needed to protect the community that may be in conflict with current bioethical principles regarding the care of individual patients.\" In Africa, reactions are also traditionally driven, often leading to unscientific or crude responses to the threat. It is often possible for \"uncommon scenarios\" to be attributed to supernatural and mystical causes (Amzat & Razum, 2014) . Controlling misconceptions and reinforcing scientifically valid evidence should be a major priority of both the media and the government (Okware et al., 2002) . It is important for the media to shift from \"alarming\" to reassuring and educative coverage (see Ungar, 1998) . This was why, during the recent Ebola outbreak, the Nigerian government set up a media center led by the Minister of Health to report the state of the outbreak on a daily basis. Part of the mandate of the media center was also to address publicly circulated information about the virus and to debunk Ebola myths. This is also a kind of rumor surveillance, which is aimed at decreasing \"the potential for misinformation and misunderstanding and to inform the public and health officials about disease outbreaks, facilitate a rapid response, and promote public health preparedness\" (Samaan et al., 2005, p. 463) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 782, "end": 801, "text": "Smith et al.

People began to query patterns of normal intimacy and general interactions. For instance, hugging, handshakes and general body contact were only undertaken with cautions. This pattern was seen not only in Lagos, where there were confirmed cases, but across several nations. While some will argue that the threshold of infection was still low to affect pattern of interaction, perhaps, it is medically recommended to be preventive irrespective of the level of perceived risk.

Survival during disease outbreaks also depends on the healthcare system. The rate of survival also varies from individual to individual. In the Nigerian case, the symptomatic physician outlives the second person (a nurse), who died shortly after presenting with symptoms. This acuity or acuteness of EVD precipitates rapid actions among the public and generated a lot of experimentation with local remedies. More importantly, it could also lead to mistrust of the modern healthcare system. While most people are aware that survival rate is low, in the face of Nigeria doctors' strike, it could be lower as there might not be adequate care especially if the number of cases increases.

The ignorance often leads to misconceptions. For instance, many in Nigeria erroneously claimed that Ebola is airborne; in Sierra Leone, many relatives aggressively requested for the release of the corpse of their relatives in order to perform some burial rites, not understanding that a corpse can still spread the disease. Apart from this, there is often the problem of self-efficacy-that is ability to self-manage and implement effective action. In the context of Ebola, avoiding social contacts with people suspected of being infected can be problematic, especially when they are still asymptomatic. Contacting EVD is generally regarded as a death sentence because of the unavailability of a known cure at the moment, and the fear of isolation/ quarantine could prevent a number of people from reporting their status, suspicion or risk. In the first 21 days in Nigeria (as previously observed), many secondary contacts \"escaped\" monitoring, thereby posing great concern/risk to the general public.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 326, "end": 348, "text": "(Smith et al., 2004:4)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Public Panic and the Search for a Local Remedy"}, {"text": "With the news of the outbreak of Ebola in Nigeria, the first reaction of many was a conspiracy theory.

Why did Mr. Sawyer deny any possibility of risk of Ebola directing the attention to a suspected case of malaria? While Mr. Sawyer was not alive to defend the circumstances surrounding his travel to Nigeria, he was being persecuted. The reason for the persecution was obvious within the incubation period of the EVD. In fact Nigerian President described him as a \"crazy\" man (Odunsi, 2014) .

Even those who are thousand kilometers away from Lagos were in panic about the report of EVD, because Lagos is characterized with massive inflow and outflow of people.

In order to facilitate the prompt international response to the global EVD emergency, the NHRECN also waived the requirement that the establishment of a Material Transfer Agreement (MTA) should precede international shipment of biological samples out of Nigeria (Adebamowo, 2014) .

The EVD (like most infectious diseases) exacts significant impact on pattern of social interaction. In the case of EVD, handshakes and other forms of casual physical contact were discouraged. The Ebola emergency also forced the Catholic Church to suspend the rite or sign of peace during mass (which involve handshaking among congregants) (Ibekwe, 2014) . Due to the warning that fruit bats are natural hosts of Ebola virus and that other forest animals were under suspicion, consumption of animals from hunting was highly discouraged. Consequently, the household economy of those who specialize in trading such animals was adversely affected. Cremation and mass burial in cemeteries far away from populated areas meant that families were forced to go against traditional arrangements and forego rites (Okware et al. 2002) . As the government might take possession of the body and bury it according to the health emergency protocol, the family might not even be allowed to see the body of the deceased (see Gostin, Lucey, & Phelan, 2014) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 432, "end": 446, "text": "(Ibekwe, 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 895, "end": 915, "text": "(Okware et al. 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1100, "end": 1130, "text": "Gostin, Lucey, & Phelan, 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Ethical Concerns Relating to Ebola Outbreak in Nigeria"}, {"text": "Another critical ethical concern is whether the refusal of the striking doctors to call off the strike should be considered as a neglect of duty (of care). The strike began approximately 2 weeks before the first case of EVD in Nigeria. The declaration of the national emergency should depend greatly on the health workers especially physicians. Iserson et al. (2008) rightly observed that most public health emergency plans often rely on physicians, nurses, emergency department support staff, and out-of-hospital personnel to maintain the healthcare system's front line. Perhaps, if some of them return as volunteers despite the strike, this could be humanitarian enough in conformity with some level of duty of care. A nurse on leave from Emory University Hospital exhibited altruistic practice and duty of care by returning to work to care for the American Ebola victims brought from Liberia.

In the face of EVD, the needs and rights of populations and certain individuals might be breached as a result of disease screening and quarantine (Smith et al., 2004, p. 2) . In the case of health emergencies, individuals have a societal obligation to cooperate with health and other instituted authorities in crisis management. It took the Liberian government some military involvement to curtail the movements of people in some affected quarters. In Nigeria, evading monitoring by some individuals was against public health interest and highly unethical. It is in this light that Calain, Fiore, Poncin, and Hurst (2009:7) submitted that EVD outbreak \"can be seen as a paradigm for ethical issues posed by epidemic emergencies, through the convergence of such themes as: isolation and quarantine, privacy and confidentiality and the interpretation of ethical norms across different ethnocultural settings\" (Calain et al., 2009, p. 7) , including the use of experimental drugs, contact tracing and monitoring and compulsory disease screening.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 489, "end": 515, "text": "(Smith et al., 2004, p. 2)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 925, "end": 966, "text": "Calain, Fiore, Poncin, and Hurst (2009:7)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1250, "end": 1277, "text": "(Calain et al., 2009, p. 7)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Ethical Concerns Relating to Ebola Outbreak in Nigeria"}, {"text": "Nigeria was eventually declared Ebola-free on October 19, 2014.

Perhaps the index case could have been stopped and isolated at the airport.
