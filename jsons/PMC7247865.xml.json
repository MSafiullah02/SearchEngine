Others have seen reduced duty hours because of scaled back elective and non-essential procedures in hospitals and to shuttering of research labs. This has also been a time of working differently: changed workflows, working in more contained environments or working remotely, adapting to accelerated use of digital pathology, and migration to virtual educational meetings, clinical conferences, and tumor boards.",

JHEP is grateful that the number of manuscripts submitted to it to date in 2020 is only mildly decreased from that submitted over the same time period in 2019. The Editor and Associate Editors of JHEP have encountered slightly more difficulty than usual finding reviewers to agree to review papers and to complete assignments by their due date because of the aforementioned workplace changes. Authors have been very accepting of these issues when notified by the Journal.",

As such, the greater hematopathology community mourns the recent death of Professor Dennis H. Wright of Southampton, United Kingdom to COVID-19 after his having suffered a fractured hip [6]. Professor Wright\u2019s early career included spending eight years at Makerere University College Medical School in Kampala, Uganda, where he collaborated with Dr. Denis Burkitt investigating a jaw tumor in children in Africa\u2019s malaria belt that became known as Burkitt lymphoma [6]. For this work, he received the Paul Ehrlich and Ludwig Darmstaedter prize in 1973 [6]. He was appointed Foundation Professor of Pathology at the newly opened Medical School of the University of Southampton in 1971 and served as the Head of Pathology at Southampton General Hospital until his retirement in 1996 [6]. At Southampton, he became a world expert in the histological diagnosis and classification of lymphoma [6]. He was a founding member and a past President of the British Lymphoma Pathology Group and the European Association for Haematopathology and served as Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Pathology for 15 years [6]. He authored numerous original research papers and several books, including Diagnostic Lymph Node Pathology, now in its third edition [6].",
