Even if diagnostic tests are widely available, presumptive clinical diagnoses will still be influencing clinical decision-making, such as the use of diagnostics, antivirals, and antibiotics. Clinical bias in the use of diagnostic testing may thus impair epidemiological surveillance and disease burden estimates. 9 To address this question further, we explored which clinical features, according to the published literature, may be associated with ARI due to influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human adenovirus (HAdV), human rhinovirus (HRV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human bocavirus-1 (HBoV-1), human parainfluenza virus (HPIV), and human coronavirus (HCoV).",

Full-text publications were accessed for a second round of review. XM and BR independently reviewed studies against the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, and any eligible discrepancy was resolved by discussion among the reviewer team (3 researchers). The clinical symptoms were grouped into the following 19 distinct symptom categories: altered or loss of consciousness (altered/LOC), anorexia/difficulty feeding, apnea, conjunctivitis, cough, hypoxia, diarrhea, dyspnea, fever, headache, malaise, myalgia, rash, rhinitis, seizures, sore throat, signs of upper respiratory tract infection, vomiting, and wheezing/bronchoconstriction/signs of lower respiratory tract infection (henceforth labeled \"wheezing\").",

This synopsis confirms that in most instances, COH data agreed with published literature trends, usually with higher OR and higher confidence levels (ie, narrower 95% CI) despite a smaller sample size. Exceptions were malaise/influenza, fever/HMPV, vomiting/HRV, and malaise/HAdV, which could not be confirmed in the COH data. The matrix view in Figure 5 also provides an overview of new negative (red) as well as positive (green) associations in the COH column/ analysis that were not evident in the LIT column/analysis. Individual clinical features were not distinctive but shared among multiple types of viral infection, even if OR were not always significant. The synopsis of meta-analysis and inception cohort suggests that fever is significantly associated with influenza and HAdV infections, but again, the presence of fever does not rule out any of the other types of viral infection. HAdV infections were also linked to diarrhea. Cough is most likely present in influenza, RSV, HMPV, and HBOV-1 infections but also observed in other respiratory infections. Wheezing was most prominent in RSV, HMPV, and HBOV-1 infections. Wheezing was less likely to be seen in influenza and HAdV infections in the cohort, whereas the literature review revealed inconclusive results in this regard. HCoV infections showed no agreement bewteen LIT and COH datasets with no data available in the literature on a number of nonrespiratory symptoms.

The prospective cohort confirmed several trends that were also identified in the meta-analysis of the published literature. But the cohort dataset also established new significant associations between individual clinical features and viral infections. Our matching analysis showed that systemic signs and symptoms such as fever and headache are more common in influenza and HAdV infections, whereas RSV, HMPV, and HBoV-1 are more likely to manifest with respiratory symptoms such as wheezing, cough, and dyspnea. This trend was observed in the meta-analysis and confirmed in the inception cohort. The approach of linking individual clinical features to specific viral infections however revealed a major diagnostic challenge to the clinician: None of the associations identified with either method were unique to any specific type of respiratory viral infection, but were shared across several types of infection. Individual clinical signs or symptoms can therefore not be used to reliably rule-in or rule-out any specific type of respiratory viral infection. For the time being, physicians need to be aware that clinical diagnoses are insufficiently sensitive, and laboratory testing will remain inevitable.",

The findings by Ebell et al 71 however are limited by the fact that viruses other than influenza (such as adenoviruses for example) were not studied. Thornton et al, 72 the second literature review in this area, found that wheezing is associated with RSV infections, but this study again lacked associations with other respiratory viral pathogens tested in this study (such as HMPV andHBoV-1). The latter also differed from the current study in that it was restricted to children with acute cough. Compared to previous reviews, our meta-analysis included more recent literature sources and lager sample sizes(49 858  versus 6790 and 15 069, respectively)and a slightly greater number of countries (24 versus 4 and 20, respectively). This current meta-analysis is also the only one linking to a prospective dataset.Overall, literature data on RSV and influenza (and to a lesser degree, HMPV) seemed more readily available than literature on other respiratory viruses, which remain understudied in children. With the advent of new vaccines and antivirals against various respiratory viruses however, it will soon become critical to distinguish respiratory viral infections and to study the associated disease burden, including in the acute care setting.",
