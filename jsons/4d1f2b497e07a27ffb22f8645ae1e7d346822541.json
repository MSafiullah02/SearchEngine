Maintain effective communication with employees, pay attention to them, and listen to them effectively. 2. Choose wise motivations: Talk about the importance of staff work, appreciate their work, and provide encouragement. 3. Note work-life balance: Define a proper and balanced workload for employees. Say that optimal performance depends on enough rest and emphasize the need to re-energize. 4. Encourage peer support: Protect your staff from external pressures and from illogical or uncertain demands from patients and individuals, and promote support among colleagues. 5. Provide resources to protect employees and their mental health: Minimize risky conditions in the organization and minimize workplace stress to ensure that staff are not exposed to additional stressors. 6. Build a good community: Build the right teamwork and improve working relationships. 7. Increase employee control over their work: Clarify your expectations of employees and create an environment for team members to perform important tasks without interruption. 8. Review your achievements regularly: Talk to staff about progress and successes. 9. Cancel unnecessary meetings: Try to avoid unnecessary gatherings at work. Use video conferencing if a meeting needs to be held.",
