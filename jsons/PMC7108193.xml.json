For a potential epitopic peptide, we specifically looked for high local hydrophilicity, charged residues on the exposed protein surface, and accessible surface area. Statistical analysis based on the linear amino acid sequences of the three proteins suggests that, in contrast to the other two viral structural proteins, the N protein contains a high percentage of accessible residues and low hydrophobicity (See Figs. 1\u20133 in the Data Supplement that accompanies the online version of this article athttp://www.clinchem.org/content/vol49/issue12/). A total of 41 peptides spanning multiple possible epitopic sites along the S, M, and N proteins were designed and synthesized in a solid-phase peptide synthesizer. These peptides were purified by HPLC, incubated with panels of sera from both controls and SARS patients, and then subjected to ELISA for measurement of the immunoreactivities. The correlations between the length of amino acid sequence and immunoreactivity are shown in Fig. 1 . The peptides representing the COOH terminus of the N protein, in particular N371 and N385, had high absorbance/cutoff value ratios with the highest positive detection rate and the lowest hydrophobicity score among all of the synthesized peptides (Fig. 1C, and Fig. 3 in the online Data Supplement). Peptide N66 is located in a hydrophilic region and reacts with SARS serum antibodies. However, compared with the peptide region N371\u2013N404, which has a score of 9.4 for accessible residues and a hydrophobicity score of \u22123.5, peptide N66 has relatively low antigenicity because of a correspondingly lower score for accessible residues (6.2) and higher score for hydrophobicity (\u22121.8). These differences may partially explain the low number of true positives (58%) that we obtained when we used N66 as an antigen. According to the hydrophobicity analysis (Figs. 1 and 2 in the online Data Supplement), most regions in both the S and M proteins are very hydrophobic. Although many factors influence antigen\u2013antibody interactions, two major factors, charge\u2013charge interactions and hydrogen bonding caused by hydrophilicity, have been hypothesized to be crucial for an epitopic site (9).",

Moreover, the number of polar amino acids in each peptide correlates well with the percentage of true positive, e.g., N371 and N385 reacted with >94% of the samples from SARS patients and contain nine and seven polar amino acids, respectively, whereas S599, M137, and N66 reacted with \u226480% of the sera from SARS patients and have four, three, and three polar amino acids, respectively.

            "text": "Members of the coronavirus family all have three major structural proteins, S, M, and N, but the antigenicities and roles of these viral proteins in immunity remain unclear. Different viruses often cause different immunoresponses. For example, in infectious bronchitis virus (10), the S glycoprotein is more antigenic than either the N or the M protein. Because S protein is exposed to the outer viral surface, it is often used as the antigenic group for serologic testing. The M protein, embedded in the viral envelope, has highly variable sequences and is considered to exhibit weak antigenicity, but glycosylation of this protein may elicit antibody production. One common phenomenon is that the N proteins have been shown to be strong immunogens in several coronaviruses, such as murine coronavirus (11), turkey coronavirus (12), and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (13). In these viruses, the N protein is a highly abundant and relatively conserved antigen. Importantly, the N protein may be involved in stimulating cytotoxic T lymphocytes. It has been reported that the N protein accumulates even before it is packaged in the mature virus (14). A cellular immune response elicited early in infection by internal viral proteins could therefore be an important defense mechanism. On the basis of the genomic sequences published to date, most of the SARS-coronavirus N protein is highly conserved among strains. Thus, the N protein, which has high antigenicity, is likely to have a great impact on the development of diagnostic tests for SARS.",

As shown in Fig. 2 , some immunostained bands appeared only on the membranes incubated with patient sera, suggesting that these proteins are associated with SARS. On the basis of genomic data, the structural proteins of the virus have molecular masses of 139 (S protein), 46 (N protein), 25 (M protein), and 8 (E protein) kDa (4), respectively. In all of the Western blots performed with sera from three SARS patients as the primary antibody, no protein band <40 kDa was immunostained, suggesting that the M and E proteins either do not elicit antibody production or generate low antibody titers in SARS patients. Of the protein bands >40 kDa, most were located around two regions (Fig. 2 ), 49 and 120\u2013240 kDa. The protein band slightly smaller than 49 kDa reacted consistently with all SARS sera. Because its location is close to the theoretical molecular mass of the N protein, 46 kDa, we believe that this protein is the N protein. The immunostained bands around 120\u2013240 kDa did not display a consistent pattern. Although the theoretical value of the S protein is 139 kDa, it has been reported to be glycosylated during infection of the host cells. It therefore is not surprising that SARS-coronavirus S proteins have significantly higher molecular masses than the theoretical value. We thus deduced that these immunostained proteins with high molecular masses are the S protein.",

Of these, N401, located at the end of the N protein, had low reactivity in the ELISA; conversely, the other three peptides were significantly more immunoreactive in the ELISA. To determine which peptides had higher affinities for antibodies from SARS sera, we quantitatively measured the binding of the peptides to the antibodies in the ELISA. In this experiment, the concentration of the antibodies was kept constant and the binding capacity was estimated as a function of peptide concentration (Fig. 3 ). Using the Scatchard equation, we calculated the constants n and kd; the binding curves obtained for the three peptides gave similar n values but different kd values. On the basis of the definitions of the two parameters in Materials and Methods, the fact that the curves give similar n numbers indicates that the peptides share similar epitopic sites, whereas the different kd values indicate that the three peptides bind to the same epitope with different affinities. Of the three peptides, the kd value for N385 was much lower than the kd values for N355 and N371, approximately one-fourth of the kd value for N371 and one-thirteenth of the kd value for N355, suggesting that N385 is able to bind more strongly with antibodies in SARS sera.

A possible explanation for this failure may relate to the specific recognition of the antibodies raised from a SARS case. In this case, the antibodies may not actively recognize the COOH terminus of the N protein. Hence, combining the peptides that represent different structural proteins could improve the detection coverage. We selected N371 and N385 to use in combination with peptides S599 and M137, respectively, and used these combinations as antigens for the ELISA. Contrary to our expectations, the use of peptide combinations did not improve the detection coverage, whereas single peptides displayed higher immunoreactivities in the ELISA (Table 1 in the Data Supplement). This unexpected behavior may be attributable to interactions between peptides N385 and S599 or between N371 and M137. If this hypothesis is correct, then generating a chimeric peptide by linking the two peptides could be a good solution for reducing interactions.
