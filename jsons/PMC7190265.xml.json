First, the reliance on microsystems to define optimal processes for various populations results in variability from clinical unit to unit in whether and how standards are modified. Second, as microsystems adopt and iterate on variations of the bundle, we moved away from adherence to all of the bundle elements and focused instead on performance on individual elements to define success. This focus led to a perception that despite following most of the bundle elements, CLABSI rates were immutable. Third, microsystems also adapt performance measures specific to each unit, which meant there was an emphasis on different measures in each unit. As an example, due to gestational age restrictions on the use of chlorhexidine in neonates, the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) developed an alternate bathing protocol for their patients. These differences led to migration away from common standards, limiting transparency/comparability, and making accountability challenging for an entire system. This variation also led to confusion for providers, caregivers, and patients when they moved between clinical units.",

The team developed a systems-based A3 with key drivers and countermeasures targeted toward adherence to the complete bundle. A3 is a problem-solving tool that involves defining the problem, articulating an achievable goal, analyzing causes, identifying key drivers and specific countermeasures, and making iterations based on results. The key drivers included (1) practice standardization and operations, (2) data and transparency, and (3) safety culture and accountability (Fig. 1 and Supplemental Digital Content at http://links.lww.com/PQ9/A172 for Figure). We identified these key drivers through lessons learned from several years of CLABSI reduction work and with input from unit-level physician and nurse leaders. Implementation of the A3 involved additional members from information systems, analytics, vascular access, interventional radiology, physician and nurse leaders, and front-line providers.",

This nursing-led team met over 2 days to develop standardized approaches relevant to central line maintenance practices (changing of needleless connector, changing of intravenous tubing, chlorhexidine bathing, scrubbing the hub, protection of central line environment, procedure for blood culture drawing) and implementation of bundle round audit process (which entails bedside rounding on all elements of the bundle for every central line).",

CLABSI SIR >1.0 indicates that there were more CLABSIs observed than predicted; conversely, a SIR <1.0 indicates that there were fewer CLABSIs observed than predicted.18 We used statistical process control (SPC) charts to display the CLABSI rate and SIR over time. The center-line represents the average with 3 standard deviations upper and lower control limits included in the chart. The control charts were produced using the plug-in QI Macros for Excel. While both CLABSI rate and SIR exclude mucosal barrier injury-related bloodstream infection, SIR adjusts for the facility and/or patient-level factors that contribute to HAI risk.

Since the intervention incorporated several key drivers over several quarters, we considered the intervention period to extend from October 2017 to June 2018, and we excluded that period from the analysis. Thus, our pre-intervention period ranged from January 2015 to September 2017, and our post-intervention period included data from July 2018 to June 2019. Our independent variables included the intervention (post versus pre-intervention), time (secular trends based on quarterly data), and an interaction term to determine whether the intervention resulted in a change in slope for the comparison of the post versus pre-implementation period. Since the interaction term was not significant, we present the most parsimonious CLABSI model here. We present incidence rate ratios with 95% CI. A P-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.",

Units governed their practices, and alignment with organizational standards or teams was not prioritized. In this initiative, our NICU team realigned efforts within the context of a mesosystem focused on CLABSI prevention, with specific, justifiable requests for adaptation of the standards for their population. For example, the NICU team specifically reviewed the evidence for the safety and effectiveness of chlorhexidine bathing in the NICU population. After their review, they requested the use of a bathing protocol that specifically incorporated the use of specific products and frequency by gestational age, which the CLABSI governance team approved based on their evidence review. Also, the NICU works in an open bay environment, where there were concerns about the role of the physical environment and risk for infections. Thus, the NICU also emphasized the importance of adherence to unit-specific environmental hygiene practices as a key component of their infection prevention efforts. Despite these unit-specific adaptations, the overall emphasis remained on all-or-none bundle adherence and accountability for practice. Data on bundle element adherence were provided to bedside nurses and unit leadership. Unit leadership conducted bedside bundle rounds to provide just-in-time education to bedside staff on best practices for individual bundle elements to ensure consistency and high reliability. Hospital leadership conducted rounds with the NICU teams to emphasize the importance of CLABSI prevention to the organization and to further enhance the sense of accountability at all levels.",

However, in comparing with another HAI such as CAUTI in the same period, where we did not have a similar mesosystem-focused initiative, we did not observe declines. Second, our findings may have been due to a Hawthorne effect (changed behaviors while being observed), since there was consistent and very visible macrosystem focus on the goal of CLABSI reduction. Yet, a similar macrosystem focus in several years prior did not yield similar reductions in CLABSI. Finally, our post-intervention period only included four quarters of data; thus, we will need to continue monitoring to ensure the sustainability of the mesosystem intervention. However, by not adding to the workload of our front-line providers and streamlining it through a clear process, we believe the results of this intervention are sustainable. Ongoing work to integrate other best practices such as reducing placement of lines, prompt removal of lines, and reducing central line access will potentially further reduce the incidence of CLABSIs.",
