The spread of the infection and the subsequent health emergency led to the mobilization of healthcare authorities, medical professionals and research communities. This resulted in the rapid discovery of the pathogen as a novel coronavirus, development of diagnostic tools, and steps for treatment protocols. This new pathogen was called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the disease has been termed novel coronavirus infection 2019 . Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurs mainly via respiratory droplets, similar to the spread of influenza. The estimated basic reproduction number (R0) and serial interval are 2.2 and 5-6 days, respectively, a doubling time of the number of infected subjects every three days. The clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 ranges from asymptomatic disease, to mild upper respiratory tract infection symptoms (fever, sore throat, cough, fatigue), to severe pneumonia with respiratory failure and death .",

Millions of people have been already infected, and more than one hundred thousand individuals have died. Despite all preventive measurements, the numbers of cases is still rising, with Europe and the United States being the hotspot of the pandemic, but with increasing number of cases in other countries and continents. Epidemiological data show that elderly and those with co-morbidities (diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular, respiratory, renal and lung diseases) are most susceptible to COVID-19 and more likely to suffer from the most severe disease complications. Interestingly, young children, including infants who are more susceptible to other infections, have milder symptoms and less severe COVID-19.",

            "text": "One very important aspect in improving the outcome of the patients with COVID-19 is understanding the mechanisms leading to increased severity and mortality. The first event after the inhalation of SARS coronaviruses is the invasion of epithelial cells and type II pneumocytes through binding of the SARS spike protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors ( Figure 1 ) (Kuba et al., 2005) This complex is proteolytically processed by the type 2 transmembrane protease TMPRSS2 leading to cleavage of ACE2 and activation of the spike protein (Glowacka et al., 2011) , thereby facilitating viral entry into the target cell. It has been suggested that cells in which both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed are most susceptible to entry by coronaviruses from the SARS family, among which the virus described to cause SARS (SARS-CoV) (Shulla et al., 2011) , and most likely also SARS-CoV-2. Viral entry and cell infection trigger the host's immune response, and an inflammatory cascade is initiated by innate immune cells. The receptor and signalling mechanisms actually responsible for the induction of inflammatory mediators such as cytokines or chemokines induced by SARS-CoV-2 are not yet identified. However, two possible mechanisms can be envisaged: one is represented by the release of danger signal molecules such as certain cytokines (e.g. IL-1\u03b1, IL-8) or ATP, and a second may involve a different recognition pathway mediated in professional immune cells by known patternrecognition receptors such as TLRs ( Figure 1 ). Indeed, it has been shown that SARS-CoV is recognized by TLR3 and TLR4 that induce an inflammatory reaction through both MyD88 (Sheahan et al., 2008) and TRIF-mediated pathways (Totura et al., 2015) , and a similar process may be hypothesized for SARS-CoV-2. Similarly, activation of the inflammasome and the IL-1\u03b2 pathway by SARS-CoV (Shi et al., 2019) is also likely to play an important role in the pathogenesis: this hypothesis is supported by the recent transcriptional identification of IL-1 pathway as being strongly upregulated in COVID-19 patients (Ong et al., 2020) .",

This is supported by a recent study that described the sequence of immune cell population changes in one patient with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 that recovered from infection (Thevarajan et al., 2020) .

New studies suggest that immune dysfunction in COVID-19 is more complex however. In this respect, lymphopenia is one of the most important immune features of the disease that is associated with severity, with both CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes being defective (Qin et al., 2020) . Known age-related differences in the immune function of T-cell and B-cells could lead to insufficient control of viral replication, thereby increasing disease severity. Consistent with this, a recent study shows hyperinflammation of the immune response in COVID-19 patients, characterized by high cytokine production capacity of circulating monocytes despite the severity of the disease (which is different from bacterial sepsis), and high systemic concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines (Giamarellos-Bourboulis et al., 2020) .

In contrast, in individuals with a defective immune response either due to old age or co-morbidities, unrestricted viral replication leads to high concentrations of virus, which in turn triggers hyperinflammation, and severe complications such as ARDS and death ( Figure 2 ). It could therefore be argued that a rational immune-based therapy should be adapted according to the phase of the disease. In the uninfected host, the strategy should be to boost the innate immune responses to enable viral replication to be kept under control. In the later phase of the disease, the aim should be to interrupt the hyper-inflammatory loop to prevent severe complications. We therefore argue that induction of innate immune reprogramming (trained immunity) before infection may be a rational approach for boosting antiviral responses and thus preventing infection. Treatment with inhibitors of the IL-1/IL-6 pathway has been proposed to be useful in the management of hyperinflammation in severely ill patients with COVID-19, and clinical trials with this strategy are under way.",

An initial challenge of innate immune cells by vaccines or living pathogens during infection leads to activation of intracellular pathways, that subsequently lead to the upregulation of proinflammatory gene transcription. After the initial stimulus is eliminated or subsides, gene transcription returns to baseline. Transcription of genes important for host defense and the production of proinflammatory cytokines is subsequently more potently increased when the monocytes or macrophages are re-challenged with the same or a different stimulus . To allow this to happen, the cell machinery must grant access to the regions of the genome that contain the target sequences and the regulatory elements of the genes involved in these processes. This is regulated through durable epigenetic modifications, which allow the unfolding of the chromatin and the accessibility of the transcription factors to the promoter and enhancer regions of immune-related genes involved .",

Although developed as a vaccine against tuberculosis, numerous studies have shown its ability to induce potent protection against other infectious diseases: so-called 'off-target' or 'nonspecific' effects (NSEs). Several epidemiological studies in low-income countries have shown an association between neonatal BCG vaccination and a profound reduction in neonatal mortality (Benn et al., 2013) . Two meta-analyses performed at the request of WHO have concluded that BCG vaccination is very likely to have important beneficial NSEs, although the quality of some of the studies was questioned, and it was concluded that more research is warranted (Higgins et al., 2016) . In addition, experimental studies suggest that BCG may protect against viral pathogens, including respiratory syncytial virus, human papilloma virus and herpes simplex virus (Freyne et al., 2015; Moorlag et al., 2019) .",

Measles and oral polio vaccine (OPV) have been also shown to provide protection against heterologous infections and mortality (for review see (Goodridge et al., 2016) ). Based on these data, it is justifiable to also evaluate these vaccines for induction of a non-specific boost of anti-viral mechanisms against COVID-19. Similarly, intranasal administration of the TLR3 ligand poly IC:LC has been shown to protect against SARS in experimental models (Kumaki et al., 2017) , and could be tested against infection with SARS-CoV-2.",

Induction of trained immunity with BCG vaccination results in a more effective cytokine response: cytokines important for anti-viral effects including IL-1\u03b2, TNF, interferons, are more readily produced. Importantly however, these cytokines are also present in high circulating concentrations in patients with severe forms of the disease, and can contribute to ARDS (Channappanavar and Perlman, 2017) . Inflammatory Th1/Th17 responses (Wu and Yang, 2020) may also contribute to the lung injury in the late phase of the disease. Therefore, the theoretical possibility that can the induction of trained immunity could have deleterious effects by boosting or inhibit the innate immune responses needs to be considered.",

In healthy individuals who are vaccinated with BCG, and in which the innate antimicrobial mechanisms would be boosted by trained immunity, this is inferred to lead to decreased viremia, faster viral elimination as well as decreased inflammation, less symptoms and quicker recovery. In this context, both the circulating concentrations of inflammatory cytokines and the inflammatory Th1/Th17 responses would be less strongly induced. In contrast, an initial defective antiviral response in some individuals at risk (e.g. the elderly) probably leads to high viremia, deleterious systemic inflammation, and severe disease. Breaking the loop of systemic inflammation in these patients, for example by blocking IL-1 pathway with anakinra or IL-6 function with tocilizumab, could have life-saving effects in some of these patients.",

In such a severe crisis as the pandemics with SARS-CoV-2, full exchange of methodologies and protocols, as well as collaboration within clinical trials is crucial for increasing the chance to identify new tools for the diagnostic and therapy, and improving the outcome of our patients. Genetic and non-genetic risk factors, as well as the presence of co-morbidities, determine the efficacy of the host defense mechanisms. In the early phase of the infection, a potent host defense leads to suppression of viral replication, which subsequently leads to low levels of inflammation, less severe symptoms and a good prognosis. If host defense mechanisms are defective, they can lead to massive viral replication, systemic hyperinflammation, high severity of the disease and ultimately death. Trained immunity is defined as an enhanced innate immune response to different pathogens, after an initial challenge such a vaccination or infection. Certain microbial ligands capable of binding specific pattern recognition receptors are able to induce durable metabolic and epigenetic changes in innate immune cells. This reprogramming of the metabolic and the epigenetic landscape of the cell allows a quick accessibility of transcription factors to the promoters and enhancer regions of pro-inflammatory genes upon restimulation, facilitating gene expression. The increased metabolic activity of the cell affords a fast supply of energy and metabolites necessary to mount a robust immune response upon restimulation. The combination of these epigenetic and metabolic effects affords increased responsiveness upon secondary stimulation with the same of a different ligand and even protect against a subsequent infection. Boosting the host defence by induction of trained immunity, induces a durable state of activation in the cells of the innate immune system. In this scenario, these cells would offer a faster and increased responsiveness upon contact with a new pathogen, decreasing the severity of the infections and limiting its transmission.",

While transcriptional, epigenetic and functional changes have been identified in circulating myeloid cells for months after induction of trained immunity, these cells have a lifespan of only days in the circulation. This paradox has been explained by the finding that this process also takes place at the level of myeloid bone marrow progenitors, leading to a myelopoiesis bias and the release of monocytes with a heightened preparedness to respond to pathogens (Mitroulis et al, 2018). Importantly, a second level at which trained immunity is induced is represented by the local environments in the tissue and, in the case of respiratory infections, in the lung. Experimental studies have demonstrated that alveolar or lung macrophages can also undergo long-term reprogramming after infections. A gammaherpesvirus infection can protect against an allergic response (Machiels et al., 2017), while adenovirus infection-induced remodeling in alveolar macrophages and subsequently",

The first event after the inhalation of SARS-CoV is the invasion of epithelial cells and type II pneumocytes through binding of the virus to the ACE-2 receptors through the spike protein expressed on the surface of the virus. The complex formed is processed by TMPRSS2 leading to cleavage of ACE-2 and activation of the spike protein, facilitating viral entry into the target cell. Viral entry and cell infection trigger the immune response. Two possible mechanisms of initiation of the inflammatory cascade can be considered: one is the release of danger signal molecules such as certain cytokines (such as IL-1\u03b1 or IL-8) or ATP. The second involves different recognition pathways mediated by immune cells, which initiate the inflammatory response. ACE-2: angiotensin-converting enzyme 2.
