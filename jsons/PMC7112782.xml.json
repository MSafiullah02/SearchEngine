            "text": "Belonging to the Mononegavirales order, Paramyxoviridae family and Avulavirus genus, Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is an enveloped virus containing linear, non-segmented single-stranded RNA (Lamb et al., 2005). NDV strains are classified into one of three major pathotypes: velogenic, mesogenic and lentogenic (Beard and Hanson, 1984). Highly virulent velogenic strains cause acute infections with high mortality, mesogenic (intermediately virulent) strains cause respiratory disease in young chickens and decreased egg production, whereas lentogenic (avirulent) strains cause mild respiratory infection or give no symptoms in poultry (Seal et al., 1995). Studies conducted by Rott and Klenk (1988) revealed the key role of a small amino acid motif at the cleavage site of the F0 protein of NDV in the molecular determination of the pathotype. The presence of two pairs of basic amino acids at positions 112, 113, 115 and 116 and phenyloalanine at position 117, at fusion protein cleavage site, makes this site susceptible to cleavage by common subtilisin-like protease and easier spread throughout the host. The sequence (C-112R/K-R-Q-K/R-R-F117-N) is observed in highly virulent strains. In the low virulence strains, there are only two basic amino acids at position 113 and 116, along with leucine at position 117 (C-112G/E-K/R-Q-G/E-R- L117-N). This motif is recognized only by trypsin-like proteases, which are present mainly in the respiratory tract (Collins et al., 1996, Nagai et al., 1976). Because of the role of the cleavage site in pathogenicity, the F gene is the major target for differentiation of Newcastle disease virus.",

Several methods for the detection and differentiation of NDV have been previously described. Most assays are based on the detection of the fusion gene (Pham et al., 2005) or the matrix and fusion genes (Wise et al., 2004, Steyer et al., 2010). However, other regions are also used for general detection and differentiation (Fuller et al., 2010, Tan et al., 2009). The first SYBR Green I assay for the detection of NDV was described by Tan et al. (2004), but this assay could not be used for differentiation of pathotypes of the virus. Pham et al. (2005) described a SYBR Green I real-time PCR melting curve analysis assay for differentiation, although the differences in the Tm values between the three genotypes were not very significant and could cause false characterization of the virus. Many real-time PCR assays for NDV detection and differentiation using different TaqMan probes were developed but degenerated primers were not used very often. Also, false negative results were reported (Cattoli et al., 2009, Wise et al., 2004). In some cases, to differentiate between pathotypes of NDV, it was necessary to use two or three pairs of primers and several different TaqMan probes in one reaction were necessary (Wise et al., 2004, Farkas et al., 2009).",

F gene-specific, degenerated primers were used in the assay. The use of degenerated primers made it possible to avoid the previously reported difficulties in the design of primers (Aldous and Alexander, 2001) and, additionally, it allowed for the use of only one set of primers for the differentiation of virulent and avirulent strains of Newcastle disease virus. This is the first assay based on SYBR Green I that uses degenerated primers to detect virulent and avirulent strains of NDV in one tube reaction with high resolution. The correlations between virulent (ICPI > 0.7) and non-virulent (ICPI < 0.7) strains and melting temperature values are shown in Table 1. The distinction between lentogenic and mesogenic (3.26 \u00b0C) or lentogenic and velogenic (5.15 \u00b0C) NDV strains was more simple than previously described by Pham et al. (2005), which yielded values of 1.22 \u00b0C and 2.15 \u00b0C, respectively. Additionally, such a high difference in melting temperature values makes it possible to calculate a safe boundary line (83.80 \u00b0C) for differentiation of NDV strains. This in turn allows for a straightforward method to monitor and classify virulent and avirulent strains of NDV in agreement with European Union directive (CEC, 1992), which calls for the full control of isolates with an intercerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) greater than 0.7.",

Differences in Ct values are cause by differences across methods. In real-time PCR using the TaqMan method (Mia Kim et al., 2008), probes are released and degraded during each cycle and fluorescence increases cumulatively during the reaction. When the SYBR Green I method is used fluorescence increases proportionally. That explains why higher Ct values were obtained while using this method. The advantages of using this SYBR Green I method are that its operation costs are lower in comparison to either methods using TaqMan, and it is possible to perform the reaction in a single tube. The previous methods employed two or three pairs of primers (Wise et al., 2004), and their products for lentogenic and velogenic strains (Farkas et al., 2009), in some cases, were different in length, which excludes the possibility of using the real-time PCR SYBR Green I assay.",
