            "text": "Calf diarrhea is a major cause of economic loss with high morbidity and mortality in the cattle industry worldwide (Bartels et al., 2010, de la Fuente et al., 1999, Kelling et al., 2002, Uhde et al., 2008, United, 2007). Many factors are known to contribute to calf diarrhea. Historically, calf diarrhea has been commonly attributed to bovine rotavirus group A (BRV-A), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), Salmonella spp. (Salmonella), Escherichia coli (E. coli) K99+, and Clostridium perfringens (C. perfringens) type C and Cryptosporidium parvum (C. parvum) (Acha et al., 2004, Reynolds et al., 1986, Saif and Smith, 1985, Snodgrass et al., 1986). The specific etiology of many field cases of calf diarrhea still remain undiagnosed (Milnes et al., 2007). Recently, bovine norovirus (BNoV), Nebovirus, bovine enterovirus (BEV) and bovine torovirus (BToV) have been identified as potential causes of calf diarrhea (Blas-Machado et al., 2007, Haschek et al., 2006, Hoet et al., 2003a, Kaplon et al., 2011, Otto et al., 2011, Park et al., 2007, Park et al., 2008a, Park et al., 2008b). Some of these agents (i.e., BNoV, BEV and BToV) have also been found in feces from clinically healthy calves (Haschek et al., 2006, Jimenez-Clavero et al., 2005, Mijovski et al., 2010, Shanks et al., 2008) and many of previous epidemiological studies for BNoV and BToV have been focused only on diarrheic calves (Hoet et al., 2003b, Milnes et al., 2007, Park et al., 2007, Park et al., 2008b). Their role in calf diarrhea still remains to be evaluated.",

Historically, virus isolation, electron microscopy, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, latex agglutination test, bacterial culture, direct microscopy of fecal smear (acid-fast stain), and/or fecal flotation have been commonly used to test fecal samples for enteric pathogens (Cho et al., 2010). These procedures are reliable; however, they are time-consuming and require specialized knowledge. Recently, nucleic acid based tests, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays, have become popular for rapid and sensitive detection of infectious agents (Albini et al., 2008, Cho et al., 2010). Multiplex real-time PCR panels have been proven to be a useful diagnostic tool for concurrent detection of several target enteric pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity (Albini et al., 2008, Cho et al., 2010), which decreases bias in diagnostic outcome due to testing method.",

            "text": "In this study, we investigated the prevalence of 11 calf enteric pathogens consisting of 7 common (BRV-A, BCoV, BVDV, Salmonella, E. coli K99+, Cpt \u03b2 and C. parvum) and 4 emerging pathogens (BNoV, Nebovirus, BEV and BToV) and then evaluated two aspects; their clinical significance in calf diarrhea and co-infection between them. Not unexpectedly, 80% of diarrheic calves tested were positive for at least one of the target enteric pathogens, suggesting that the infectious factor is still a major cause of calf diarrhea. More than 50% of the diarrheic calves tested were concurrently infected with more than one pathogen. Co-infection with 2 pathogens was the most common finding (31%) with up to 6 pathogens detected in 1% of the fecal samples from diarrheic calves. The majority of diarrheic cases were identified among 0- to 4-week-old calves and concentrated among calves at 0\u20132 weeks of age, which is similar to previous reports by other investigators (Bartels et al., 2010, de la Fuente et al., 1999, McDonough et al., 1994). High frequency of co-infection by multiple pathogens in young animals emphasizes that interventions for calf diarrhea should be focused on husbandry and management strategies, including assurance of colostrum intake, hygiene, reduction of population density, or modified components of the Sandhills calving system (Larson and Tyler, 2005). Twenty percent of the diarrheic calves were negative for all of the 11 pathogens in this study. While low sensitivity of the test might be accounted for the negative result, the role of non-infectious factors (e.g., cold weather, impaired uptake of colostrum, or poor sanitation) in calf diarrhea cannot be discounted. In addition, the possibility of other pathogens (e.g., rotavirus B or C; coccidia; C. perfringens type A, D or E; and other pathogroups of E. coli) or previously unrecognized agent(s) involved in diarrhea remains to be further studied.",

In contrast, the proportion of bacteria-positive samples was relatively small. Of three target bacterial pathogens, Salmonella (9%) was the most commonly detected in the diarrhea feces examined. Interestingly, none of the fecal samples from both diarrheic and healthy calves was positive for Cpt \u03b2 which is contained in either C. perfringens type B or C. This was an unexpected observation since C. perfringens type C has been postulated as the main type causing calf diarrhea. Although the PCR results were not confirmed by anaerobic bacterial culture, it should be noted that our observation is in agreement with previous reports by other investigators describing no (Albini et al., 2008, Ferrarezi et al., 2008, Sting, 2009) or very low detection of Cpt \u03b2 (Gurjar et al., 2008) in diarrheic calves, suggesting that C. perfringens type C is rarely involved in outbreaks of calf diarrhea or is simply an opportunistic bacterium causing acute enterotoxemia under certain favorable conditions. As it was suggested that all types of C. perfringens should be considered as a calf diarrhea etiology (Ferrarezi et al., 2008), involvement of other types of C. perfringens in diarrhea cases may be necessary.",

It may imply the difficulty with C. parvum control in the field due to autoinfection, environment resistance of oocysts and lack of effective treatment and vaccine (Joachim et al., 2003). Preventative measures for C. parvum in cow-calf operations should be focused on keeping good herd sanitation and sick animals segregated from healthy ones (Trotz-Williams et al., 2007). Co-infection with viruses (28.1%), particularly BRV-A (OR = 2.7), BNoV (OR = 3.6) and Nebovirus (OR = 7.1), was much more common than with bacteria in our study. While co-infection of BRV-A and C. parvum in diarrheic calves has been frequently reported (Bartels et al., 2010, Bjorkman et al., 2003, de la Fuente et al., 1999, Garcia et al., 2000, Uhde et al., 2008), common association of Nebovirus and C. parvum in diarrheic animals is a new observation. It has been reported that viral infections, such as porcine circovirus type 2 and human immunodeficiency virus, can increase the susceptibility of pigs and humans, respectively, to C. parvum (Nunez et al., 2003, Putignani and Menichella, 2010), suggesting that immunosuppressive viruses can predispose animals or humans to C. parvum. In the absence of effective treatment options for C. parvum, it may be prudent to rely on management practices and specific aids in prevention of viral infections to reduce clinical problems with C. parvum infections.",

This observation is similar to reports of human rotavirus infection being highly associated with acute watery diarrhea (Olesen et al., 2005, Wilhelmi et al., 2003). A high correlation between BRV-A detection and diarrhea (OR = 79.9) and a wide range of association with other pathogens (BNoV, BCoV, Salmonella and C. parvum) may be an evidence that BRV-A is a primary major bovine enteric pathogen of calf diarrhea, which is also in agreement with previous reports describing the primary role of BRV-A in neonatal calf diarrhea (Bartels et al., 2010, Garcia et al., 2000, Uhde et al., 2008). Our and others\u2019 observations raise concerns regarding vaccination practices on farms and the efficacy of current licensed BRV-A vaccines since vaccination has been a main tool for prevention of BRV-A associated diarrhea in neonates. Implementation of a regular vaccination program for BRV-A can be easily achieved through enhancing the awareness of the high frequency of rotavirus-associated calf diarrhea in the field, but continuing efficacy of BRV-A vaccines may require frequent surveillance and further characterization of rotaviruses circulating in the field. Surveillance is warranted since antigenic variation of rotavirus due to frequent mutation and recombination is of a great concern for emerging a variant or new serotype (Martella et al., 2010).",

The most noteworthy observations from our study were the significant association of BNoV (OR = 2.0) and Nebovirus (OR = 16.7) with calf diarrhea and their frequent detection (44.7% and 21.6%, respectively) in calf diarrhea cases, suggesting that bovine caliciviruses may play a more significant role in calf diarrhea than what was believed. It is an unexpected observation that Nebovirus was detected in diarrheic animals at a much higher rate than what was previously reported from France (Kaplon et al., 2011). A high frequency of BNoV detection is, on the other hand, not a surprise since many other investigators have previously reported a high prevalence of BNoV infection in the studied bovine populations (Cho et al., 2011, Di Bartolo et al., 2011, Jor et al., 2010, Kaplon et al., 2011, Mijovski et al., 2010, Park et al., 2007, Reuter et al., 2009, van der Poel et al., 2003, Wise et al., 2004, Yilmaz et al., 2011). Clinical significance of BNoV infection has not been clear in the field because the virus has also been found in clinically healthy calves (Jor et al., 2010, Mijovski et al., 2010) as also shown in our study. Recently an animal study has demonstrated that BNoV is pathogenic to na\u00efve calves (Otto et al., 2011). In our study, which is the first case\u2013control study evaluating BNoV as bovine enteric pathogen for calf diarrhea, a significant quantitative difference in the virus amount between fecal samples from diarrheic and healthy calves was detected, suggesting that disease progression may depend upon the initial exposure dose of the virus or factors contributing to BNoV replication to a high titer. While such a difference in replication ability did not appear to be due to unique genetic profile of BNoV's polymerase gene (data not shown), further study remains to redefine the pathogenicity of bovine caliciviruses and to determine the correlation between virus amount and the pathogenicity and identify contributing factors.",

However, such a role has been challenged as some epidemiological studies could not demonstrate a statistically significant association between BCoV infection and calf diarrhea (Bartels et al., 2010, Bjorkman et al., 2003, Uhde et al., 2008). A recent cohort study on Dutch cattle farms even suggested potential opportunistic nature of BCoV infection with previous history of diarrhea (Bartels et al., 2010). In our study, BCoV was found to be significantly associated with calf diarrhea although its association strength with calf diarrhea was relatively weak (OR = 2.7) as compared to pathogens historically known to be causes of calf diarrhea such as BRV, C. parvum, E. coli K99+ and Salmonella. As reported by other investigators, the virus was also detected in some of the fecal samples (12.2%) from healthy calves. While this was initially suspected to be due to fecal shedding of a vaccine virus (Theil and McCloskey, 1995, Thiel et al., 2011), BRV-A was not detected concurrently in those BCoV-positive samples, noting that commercial vaccines for calf scouring contain both BCoV and BRV-A in a live form. Co-infection or other factors may contribute to diarrhea in association with BCoV infection as levels of BCoV in feces from diarrheic calves were significantly higher than those in feces from healthy calves. Such a quantitative difference may be a useful criterion in determining the clinical significance of BCoV detection during diagnostic investigation.",

Such an increase in incidence and/or prevalence is more likely attributed to higher sensitivity and specificity of BEP than conventional tests and accurately reflects actual epidemiology of these pathogens in the field, while there was neither apparent increase of sample submissions nor change in personnel or fees associated with calf diarrhea testing at the lab were made during the study period. Interestingly, the detection frequency of C. parvum in diarrhea cases increased by 4.5 times (i.e., from 8.6% to 38.3%) after implementation of BEP, raising awareness of the epidemiological and clinical significance of C. parvum in the field. This observation is an example of the bias of test sensitivity on interpretation of infection prevalence or disease prevalence, which, in turn, can misguide veterinary practitioners or producers on disease intervention or animal management on farm. Continuous and frequent evaluation of the performance of diagnostic tests in context of impact on the animal (infection versus disease) is highly desired to minimize misclassification of data (David et al., 2005).",

C. parvum and BRV-A appear to be the primary enteric pathogens significantly contributing to calf diarrhea under conditions presented in the study. Frequent detection of bovine caliciviruses, such as BNoV and Nebovirus, in feces from diarrheic calves raises the need to pay attention to these viruses with respect to the management of enteric disease on farm. Use of a PCR-based testing panel (e.g., multiplex real-time PCRs) covering a wide range of known and potential pathogens with defined sensitivity and specificity is strongly recommended for monitoring/surveillance of populations for diseases, particularly when dealing with multifactorial diseases such as calf diarrhea or bovine respiratory disease complex. Such a screening test for multiple pathogens would be useful for not only studying the host-agent ecology, disease expression and dynamics in a population but also developing an effective intervention strategy for disease control or prevention. In addition, further characterization of pathogens with high rate of mutation on the on-going basis may be necessary to keep a vaccine-based intervention strategy effective.",
