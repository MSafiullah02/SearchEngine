The yeast two-hybrid system is a powerful proteomic approach to study protein-protein interactions. After the identifi cation of specifi c cellular factors interacting with the target viral protein using the yeast two-hybrid screening system, co-immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy analyses are often used to verify the virus-host protein interactions in cells. Identifi cation of the cellular factors required for viral survival or eliminating virus infected cells could help scientists develop more effective antiviral drugs. Here we summarize a standard protocol used in our lab to study the coronavirus-host protein interactions, including yeast two-hybrid screening, co-immunoprecipitation, and immunofl uorescence microscopy analyses.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Virus-host interactions have long been studied since the fi rst discovery of Tobacco Mosaic Virus in 1898. However, due to the limitation of experimental tools to investigate the mass interacting networks was not always simple. The investigation became more productive upon the technical development of protein biochemistry, nucleic acid sequencing, and several high-throughput screening systems. Three common methods used for high-throughput protein interaction analysis are yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system, affi nity purifi cation, and protein chip [ 1 ] . Y2H was fi rst described in 1989 for identifying and analyzing various protein-protein interactions in the yeast model [ 2 ] . The GAL4 based Y2H system relies on the GAL4 transcription activator, which consists of a DNA binding domain (BD) and a transcription activating domain (AD). The yeast strain used in this system contains several nutrient gene mutations and without adding these nutrients into the culturing media, these yeast cells will not grow. Successful introduction of separate bait and prey plasmids into the mutant yeast strain will provide the lacking nutrients hence the yeast cells will survive. One or more reporter genes will be cloned under the control of the UAS-GAL4 promoter. If the BD-bait fusion protein interacts with the AD-prey fusion protein, the GAL4 activator becomes functional and binds to the GAL UAS promoter region, then activates the reporter gene(s). The expression of one or more reporter genes thus indicates that there are protein-protein interactions between the target protein (bait) and the others (prey). The activation of reporter genes provides a platform to select the yeast clones that have protein-protein interactions. Most reporter genes used in this system are the complements of the mutated nutrient genes, e.g., Histidine, or an enzyme that catalyzes a color change reaction, e.g., LacZ. Figure 1 gives a schematic view of the yeast two-hybrid system. High-throughput screening of cDNA library by Y2H system provides a fast and comprehensive way to identify the possible proteins in the library that could interact with the bait protein. The yeast clones containing the interacting proteins will survive in a nutrient lacking medium due to the activation of the reporter gene.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 549, "end": 554, "text": "[ 1 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 676, "end": 681, "text": "[ 2 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1903, "end": 1911, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The identifi cation of virus-host interactions could facilitate the understanding of viral strategy to manipulate cellular functions for its survival or to know how the host controls and eliminates the pathogens. Several studies have used Y2H techniques to study the protein-protein interactions between viruses and host cells [ 3 -6 ] . A list of the interacting cellular proteins can be established after screening using a viral protein as the bait, providing a framework for further study on the relationship between the virus and the host. However, there are several limitations in this strategy that must be considered. First, due to the modular nature, the fusion proteins are sometimes not folded in a native form; second, the posttranslational modifi cations of some proteins in mammalian cells are not present in the yeast system, if the interactions between proteins are dependent on these modifi cations, false-negative results would be observed. In Y2H systems, both the BD-fused Fig. 1 A schematic view of yeast two-hybrid system. The bait protein fused to the DNA binding domain (BD) of GAL4 protein will bind to the GAL4 UAS. If the GAL4 activating domain (AD)-fused prey protein can interact with the bait protein, then the reporter genes (e.g., LacZ or H is3) will be activated and AD-fused proteins must be targeted to the nucleus; therefore, extracellular proteins or organelle targeted proteins may not work in this system. The protocol written in this chapter is used to study protein-protein interactions of cytosolic proteins. Protocols used to study interactions between membrane proteins were depicted previously [ 7 , 8 ] .

Figure 2 shows a schematic summary of the co-immunoprecipitation assay.
