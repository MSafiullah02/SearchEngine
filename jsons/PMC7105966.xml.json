Rabies is one of the few viral diseases in which post-exposure vaccination is routinely practiced and, if the patient has been exposed to a rabid animal, prompt wound care and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) according to approved regimens will prevent rabies caused by rabies virus.6, 7 PEP includes both active and passive immunization with anti-rabies immune globulin of either human (HRIG) or equine origin (ERIG), and potent cell culture vaccines.",

From the work by Wiktor and Koprowski showing that monoclonal antibodies to rabies (vaccine) virus, and other lyssavirus antigens could be used to differentiate various \u201cstreet\u201d rabies strains,8 to the elegant work of Jean Smith and others at CDC (summarized in reference 9 and elsewhere), who used this technique to study the geographic distribution, molecular epidemiology, genetics, antigenic variation, transmission dynamics, and human risk, our ability to definitively type rabies viruses in nature has improved considerably. One example, a rabies virus isolate from a ground-dwelling vertebrate (human, raccoon, skunk, other) might clearly be shown to be the same as a rabies virus from Mexican free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) in the same area. This sort of advancement has led to a better understanding of the epidemiology of rabies.",

Lagos bat virus was the first rabies virus-related virus (i.e., the second lyssavirus) to be identified but has not been shown to cause human illness. Additional isolations of Lagos bat virus have been obtained from cats, dogs, and mongoose from throughout Africa, including isolations in South Africa.11, 12 Several of the Lagos bat virus-infected cats had been vaccinated against rabies virus, but still succumbed to infection. One isolate was obtained in France from a fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus) which had been displaying signs of aggression. The bat had been imported from Africa. Recently, improved molecular techniques have suggested greater genetic diversity within Lagos bat virus isolates, supporting the proposed existence of four geographically clustered independent lineages.13\n",

By 1969 Shope had shown that Lagos bat, Mokola and Obodhiang viruses15 were related antigenically, to each other, but a relationship to rabies virus was not investigated. First, Lagos bat and Mokola viruses were shown to cross-react in complement-fixation tests. Simultaneous collaborative studies with Frederick Murphy, a veterinary pathologist and expert electron microscopist then at CDC in Atlanta, had been intended to classify vertebrate rhabdoviruses. David Simpson, in England, had sent Lagos bat virus to Murphy, asking him to determine the morphology of that virus. Murphy related to Simpson and Shope that Lagos bat virus was a rhabdovirus and, because of similarities between that virus and rabies virus in regard to virus shape and location of intracytoplasmic inclusions, suggested that Shope determine whether it was antigenically related to rabies virus. It was, and an antigenic group was established to include these viruses. Independently, Dorothy Moore, also at the Ibadan laboratory, found that kotonkan virus was related to Mokola virus and kotonkan virus was subsequently shown to be morphologically similar to Obodhiang virus.16 Mokola virus was later isolated from a dog and a cat in South Africa. Presently the principal reservoir host of Mokola virus remains unknown.",

Ten Danish isolates from serotine bats reacted identically with a panel of monoclonal antibodies. By immunofluorescence, reaction with monoclonal antibodies, and histopathologic studies, these isolates were similar to the exclusively African Duvenhage virus and, only somewhat similar to classical rabies virus. The Danish isolates produced fatal infections in laboratory mice inoculated intracranially, as well as by footpad and oral routes. Domestic dogs and cats inoculated intracerebrally but not intramuscularly or intravenously with these viruses died within 10 days. The dogs inoculated intramuscularly or intravenously developed neutralizing antibodies to the virus and resisted challenge with a lethal dose of street rabies virus. Cats inoculated intramuscularly died of an illness compatible with rabies within 15 days. At necropsy, rabies viral antigens were detected in several organs, including brain and salivary glands. Subsequent reports from Europe indicated that rabies virus-like viruses were usually associated with serotine bats. Eventually (vide infra) this virus was named European bat lyssavirus 1 (EBLV-1). EBLV-1 has been divided into two lineages, EBLV-1a and EBLV-1b, based on phylogenetic analyses supported by geographic distribution.25\n",

The lyssavirus from serotine bats then was renamed European bat lyssavirus 1 and the newly recognized lyssavirus from Daubenton\u2019s bat (Myotis daubentonii) was named European bat lyssavirus 2 (EBLV-229;). It is now recognized that EBLV-2 is widely distributed in European bats of the genus Myotis, exclusively pond bats and Daubenton\u2019s bats, and that EBLV-2 has been the etiologic agent of rare, geographically scattered but inevitably fatal human infections. Whereas EBLV-1 is not uncommonly detected in mainland European bats and is not found in the United Kingdom, EBLV-2 has been detected only in the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, Finland and near the border between Switzerland and Germany.30 The possibility that there are pathogenetic differences between EBLV-1 and EBLV-2 has been considered. EBLV-2 has been shown to be less virulent in animal models than has EBLV-1 and both are less virulent than is rabies virus. Unprovoked (depending on your definition of \u201cprovoked\u201d) biting has been associated with bats infected with EBLV-2, whereas apparently healthy bats in Spain have been shown to excrete EBLV-1. Thus, bats infected with one or both of these lyssaviruses might occur. As summarized by Calisher et al.31 and others, bats having inapparent infections with any of many viruses may serve as convenient and cryptic reservoirs of pathogens of humans, livestock and other vertebrates.

The literature contains numerous papers reporting smaller studies with this intent but publications of a rigorous study of vaccine efficacy in humans are missing because morality demands that. A paper by Hanlon et al. reported the effect of pre-exposure rabies vaccination using two laboratory hosts, Syrian hamsters and ferrets.42 The hamsters were administered a commercial human or veterinary vaccine or an experimental vaccinia-rabies glycoprotein recombinant vaccine by the intramuscular route. Five weeks after vaccination, animals were challenged with Aravan, Khujand, Irkut or West Caucasian bat virus, or with a traditional rabies virus of dog/coyote origin. Previously vaccinated and unvaccinated ferrets also were challenged with the four new isolates. In addition, the combined effects of rabies immunoglobulin and vaccine after exposure of hamsters to each of the four isolates were investigated using commercially available human products or an experimental monoclonal antibody. Results showed reduced efficacy of pre-exposure vaccination with conventional rabies post-exposure prophylaxis against each of the four new bat viruses. In general, and interestingly, efficacy was inversely related to the genetic distance between the new isolates and traditional strains of rabies virus. For example, using West Caucasian bat virus, the most divergent of these lyssaviruses, no significant difference in mortality was found after either pre-exposure vaccination or conventional post-exposure prophylaxis, as compared with na\u00efve controls. The potential impact of these newly recognized on human and domestic animal health and the impact on populations of the presumed bat reservoir will require further field and laboratory investigations.",

Schmidt, at the U.S. Naval Medical Research Unit in Cairo, had isolated Obodhiang virus from Mansonia uniformis mosquitoes in Sudan,15 Kemp, Lee, Moore, Shope, Causey and Murphy, at the Virus Research Laboratory of the University of Ibadan, isolated kotonkan virus from culicoids (midges) collected from cattle at the University farm16 and Puchong virus was isolated from Mansonia uniformis mosquitoes collected in Selangor State, Malaysia, by unspecified workers. Adelaide River and Berrimah viruses each were isolated from bloods of apparently healthy bovids in the Northern territory of Australia, Kimberley virus was isolated from Culex annulirostris mosquitoes in the Northern Territory as well as from Culicoides brevitarsis and bovid blood in Queensland, Australia. It is not at all clear why certain ephemeroviruses share antigens with certain lyssaviruses but, according to Peter J. Walker, CSIRO Livestock Industries, Australian Animal Health Laboratory, Geelong, Victoria, Australia, a sequence of six to eight conserved amino acids can be recognized as a cross-reactive epitope. Walker has shown that such sequences occur in Adelaide River virus N protein at sites homologous to rabies virus N sequences to which even commercial rabies virus monoclonal antibodies bind. The rhabdovirus N protein is relatively, if minimally, conserved in some regions, so it is not unlikely that such short peptides could be the source of this confusion. Nevertheless, it is clear that Obodhiang, kotonkan, Puchong, Berrimah, Kimberley and Adelaide River viruses are ephemeroviruses, not lyssaviruses, and therefore are not rabies virus-related viruses in the true sense of that term, notwithstanding the work of Shope21 and Calisher et al.54\n",
