Both upper and lower respiratory tract infections have been associated with hMPV in young children and adults and the clinical symptoms are similar to those of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection (Van den Hoogen et al., 2001, Peret et al., 2002, Freymuth et al., 2003, Viazov et al., 2003, Boivin et al., 2002).",

Specimens were submitted from both hospitalized (76%) and non-hospitalized (24%) patients. The age of the 681 patients from whom samples were collected ranged from 1 day to 20 years (median age = 10 months). Fifty-five percent of samples were from male and 45% were from female patients. Thirty-six patients provided more than one specimen (mean interval = 40 days, range = 14\u201397 days). The 719 specimens represent approximately one-third of the total pediatric specimens submitted during this time period to the laboratory for respiratory virus FA analysis.

Several technical aspects of this assay warrant discussion. One of the strengths of our study was that, by testing every specimen for an external amplification control, false negative specimens due to inefficient RNA extraction or the presence of PCR inhibitors could be ruled out. However, we could not control for other factors that could lead to false negative results, such as stage of the patient's illness, or possible degradation of viral RNA during specimen transport. A previous report has suggested that RT-PCR primers that target the hMPV nucleoprotein or polymerase genes may be more suitable for hMPV detection than are primers that target the matrix, phosphoprotein, or fusion protein genes (C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al., 2003). As part of our study, we compared primers and probes designed to detect the hMPV fusion protein gene to an RT-PCR assay with primers that target the nucleoprotein gene (Maertzdorf et al., 2004). The hMPV fusion protein-based assay accurately detected and quantified hMPV isolates belonging to all four known genetic lineages. Detection of all the known subtypes of hMPV was achieved by using two primer/probe sets in the PCR reaction. Each set was designed to amplify isolates belonging to subtype A or B, but used together in one reaction mix. Whether specific hMPV subtypes are associated with the severity of illness, as has been shown for RSV (Martinello et al., 2002), has not been determined. Future work using the primer/probe sets from this assay in separate RT-PCR reactions will provide information about this question.",

The prevalence of hMPV in nasal swab specimens was significantly higher than in nasal wash specimens. The reason for collection of a swab rather than a wash from a particular patient is not known, making it difficult to draw conclusions about the relative utility of each of these samples for hMPV detection. However, these data show hMPV can readily be detected from swab specimens. Interestingly, hMPV was detected in specimens submitted from symptomatic children in all months surveyed and ranged from 4.4% to 17.4% of specimens submitted. The peak months of April and May for hMPV detection in our population agree with some published reports that the prevalence of hMPV is higher in spring (March, April, or May) compared to winter months (December, January, or February) (Peiris et al., 2003, Galiano et al., 2004, Boivin et al., 2003, Williams et al., 2004, Mullins et al., 2004, Esper et al., 2004). The median age of 11.5 months for hMPV positive children is also similar to that reported by others (Williams et al., 2004, Mullins et al., 2004). Of note, the patient age group with the highest prevalence of hMPV (7\u201312 months) was older than the age group with the highest prevalence of RSV infection (0\u20136 months) reported in a previous study (Kuypers et al., 2004).",

In our collection and testing methods, both inter and extra-cellular viral RNA were detected by the assay so that the specimen volume, more than the number of cells in a sample, determined the viral load. Volumes were recorded for each specimen and varied across the study by a factor of four. While the viral load comparisons in this paper are based on respiratory specimens that do vary in volume and inferences should be made with caution, a 10-fold difference in hMPV copies/mL between specimens is most likely a real difference. The mean number of hMPV in these specimens (7.67 log 10 copies/mL) was similar to the mean number of RSV (7.30 log 10 copies/mL) detected in pediatric respiratory specimens (Kuypers et al., 2004). For RSV infections, the virus load was significantly higher for patients in the lowest (0\u20136 months) age group compared to older RSV positive children (Kuypers et al., 2004), while for hMPV, children 7\u201312 months old had significantly higher levels of hMPV than did younger children. Ongoing investigations will help determine any associations between viral load and clinical signs and symptoms.",
