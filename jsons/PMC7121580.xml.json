Plasma angiotensinogen is cleaved by renal renin, generating angiotensin I (AngI), which is then converted to angiotensin II (AngII) by endothelial angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). AngII is considered the most important RAAS peptide and is associated with vasoconstriction and high blood pressure. AngII binds to the type\u20131 AngII receptor (AT1) in a variety of tissues. Then, aldosterone is stimulated via the AT1 receptor in the adrenal gland, facilitating sodium retention by the kidney when aldosterone binds to the mineralocorticoid receptor. More recently, several new components of the RAAS have been discovered, including ACE2 and the corresponding ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas axis, which are also present in the kidney.",

Wu et al. found that aliskiren at a dosage of 150 mg/day for six months in 103 Chinese CKD patients (both with and without diabetes) had a favorable effect on reducing residual proteinuria and inadequately controlled blood pressure (Wu et al. 2014). Mechanically, aliskiren prevents renal disease progression by suppressing both angiotensin I and II in RAAS-activated pathology; moreover, Renke revealed that aliskiren also attenuated oxidative stress and improved the functional status of tubules in nondiabetic nephropathy (Renke et al. 2014). Collectedly, these results strongly suggest that aliskiren has beneficial effects for renoprotection with or without BP-lowering effects in CKD patients. In addition, aliskiren can reduce sympathetic hyperactivity, which is often exhibited and contributes to the pathogenesis of hypertension and CVD in patients with CKD (Miyata et al. 2014).",

Because of the urinary potassium excretion caused by aldosterone, RAAS blockers can cause potassium retention.

At the level of the glomerulus, the use of aliskiren is associated with decreased podocytopathy and glomerular pressure. Tubulo-interstitial fibrosis and levels of profibrotic and oxidative markers were found to be reduced with aliskiren. The AVOID trial showed that aliskiren might have additional renoprotective effects that are independent of its blood pressure-lowering effects in patients with hypertension, type 2 diabetes and nephropathy when added to ARB. Unfortunately, another clinical trial, the ALTITUDE trial, due to a lack of apparent benefit and a higher risk of side effects, was prematurely stopped for futility in patients with type 2 diabetes and micro-albuminuria, macro-albuminuria, or cardiovascular disease. Therefore, the FDA has given a formal recommendation about aliskiren: it should not be used in association with ARBs or ACEIs as dual therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus or renal disease (Parving et al., 2012).",

In the kidney, AT2R is mainly localized to renal vessels, glomeruli, and tubules. AT2R activation also opposes the vasoconstrictor actions of AT1R by promoting dilation of the afferent and efferent arterioles. A previous study revealed that the appropriate balance between AT1R and AT2R activation might therefore play a key role in regulating the physiological functions of the renal systems (Ozono et al. 1997). Mechanistically, the following phenomena might contribute to the renoprotection of AT2R. First, AT2R stimulates mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) and inhibits ERK activity, resulting in the reduction in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity and growth inhibition. Second, AT2R regulates the production of renal nitric oxide (NO), guanosine cyclic 3\u2032,5\u2032-monophosphate (cGMP), and bradykinin (Siragy and Carey 1997; Abadir et al. 2003; Matavelli and Siragy 2015), indicating that it could be involved in the induction of vasodilation. In addition, Rompe et al. (2010) showed that targeting AT2R exerted a direct anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting NF-\u03baB activation, leading to reduced TNF-\u03b1-mediated IL-6 release from fibroblasts. Together, these data demonstrate that AT2R plays a substantial role in organ inflammation and tissue fibrosis and that its cellular signaling pathways go in opposite directions to those of AT1R.",

It is well documented that smaller molecules will be less likely to stimulate autoimmune diseases. In animal models, AngI vaccines between two carriers, tetanus toxoid (TT) (PMD-2850) and keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) (PMD3117), induced equivalent immune responses and inhibition of the pressor effects of exogenous AngI. In a phase IIa clinical trial, three or four injections of the angiotensin I vaccine PMD3117 resulted in antibody production with titers peaking 64 days after protocol initiation and no evidence of autoimmune disease. The results revealed that PMD3117 could block the RAAS system. Therefore, a new formulation of PMD3117 has been developed. Confirmation of safety is the priority, and renoprotection should be addressed by further clinical assessment in phase IIb and phase III trials (Gardiner et al. 2000; Downham et al. 2003; Do et al. 2010).",

Amb\u00fchl PM showed that VLP (AngQb) reduces blood pressure in SHR to levels obtained with an ACE inhibitor and is well tolerated in humans. Therefore, vaccination against angiotensin II has the potential to become a useful antihypertensive treatment that provides long-lasting effects and improves patient compliance (Ambuhl et al. 2007). Some studies reported that SHR exhibited an SBP decrease of 17 mmHg after immunization with a peptide-based vaccine made of a seven-amino acid sequence (AFHYESR) from the second extracellular loop of rat AT-1A receptor (ATR12181), which alleviated cardiac hypertrophy and attenuation of kidney injuries. There were no signs of autoimmune diseases in the biopsied sections of kidney. Because Freund\u2019s adjuvant is not safe for use in humans, the next phase of the study will focus on the use of ATR12181 in combination with VLP in human subjects (Zhu et al. 2006).",

The synthesis of inactive Ang 1-9 from AngI and the catabolism of AngII to produce Ang 1-7 are the main functions of ACE2 (Nishiyama et al. 2002; Tikellis et al. 2004). There may be two mechanisms to explain the beneficial effect of ACE2 in vascular diseases. First, ACE2 reduced the AngII interaction with AT1R by inducing AngII degradation; second, ACE2 reduced vasoconstriction, water retention, and reactive oxygen stress by increasing Ang1-7 synthesis (Clarke and Turner 2012). Zhong et al. found that daily treatment with recombinant human ACE2 (hrACE2) reduced the AngII-induced pressor response and normalized renal AngII levels and oxidative stress, which indicated that human ACE2 prevented AngII-mediated renal oxidative stress, inflammation, and tubulo-interstitial fibrosis in animal models (Zhong et al. 2011). Oudit GY found that treatment with hrACE2 attenuated diabetic kidney injury in the Akita mouse in association with a reduction in blood pressure and a decrease in NADPH oxidase activity (Oudit et al. 2010). Furthermore, accumulating evidence indicates that the ACE/ACE2 ratio regulates the production and accumulation of AngII and that ACE2 deficiency leads to increased AngII concentrations (Ye et al. 2004; Wakahara et al. 2007).",

AT4R has a broad distribution and is found in a range of tissues, including the adrenal gland, kidney, lung, and heart. AT4R was generally found to be more abundant than AT1R in mammalian kidneys, whereas the Ang1-7 receptor was not detected in mammalian kidneys. Rats subjected to various chronic treatments were found to preferentially present decreased kidney AT4R density (furosemide, puromycin aminonucleoside, and nitro-L-arginine methylester), decreased kidney AT1R density (bilateral ureteral obstruction), or increased kidney AT1R distribution in the inner medulla (water diuresis). These results suggest that AT4R can be expressed in several renal cells within the normal kidney. Furthermore, many animal models of renal dysfunction and injury have been identified that selectively alter kidney AT4R density and may potentially aid in elucidating the role of this novel angiotensin receptor system in renal function (Handa et al. 2001).",

After 4 months of ischemia-reperfusion, finerenone fully prevented the transition from acute kidney injury to chronic kidney disease (kidney dysfunction, increased proteinuria and tubular dilation, extensive tubule-interstitial fibrosis, and an increase in kidney TGF-\u03b2 and collagen I mRNA). Moreover, Barrera-Chimal J\u2019s lab (Barrera-Chimal et al. 2018) also reported that finerenone efficiently prevented IR-induced increases in plasma creatinine, urea, and proteinuria levels, as well as the expression of TGF-\u03b2 as an indicator of kidney fibrosis, which means that finerenone protected against the transition from acute kidney injury to chronic kidney disease. Furthermore, they found that MR deficiency in myeloid cells protected against chronic dysfunction and fibrosis induced by ischemia-reperfusion. Finally, they found that the protection afforded by MR antagonism (finerenone) or myeloid MR deficiency was due to the promotion of macrophage polarization to a wound-healing phenotype after kidney IR, preventing the development of chronic kidney fibrosis and dysfunction.",

However, the combination use of ACEI and ARB may have synergistic or addictive effects. A meta-analysis found that a combination of ACEI and ARB resulted in a clinically significant reduction in proteinuria in patients with chronic kidney disease and diabetic nephropathy regardless of BP changes (Doulton and Macgregor 2005). Another systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials evaluating the combination of an ACEI and an ARB in patients with chronic proteinuric renal disease. This finding indicated that the combination of ACEI and ARB therapy in patients with chronic proteinuric renal disease was safe, without clinically meaningful changes in serum potassium levels or glomerular filtration rates. Combination therapy was also associated with a significant decrease in proteinuria, at least in the short term (MacKinnon et al. 2006). However, Schmerbach et al. (2012) observed the effect of ACEI/ARB combination therapy in spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rats on a salt-rich diet. Renal glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis were decreased by monotherapy (telmisartan or ramipril), whereas combination treatment (telmisartan and ramipril) failed to have a significant effect. In the ONTARGET trial, the combination therapy of ramipril plus telmisartan was compared to monotherapy in patients with DM and high cardiovascular risk. There was no difference in the composite primary outcome of death or hospitalization for cardiovascular disease, but combination therapy was associated with significantly more hypotension, syncopes, and a faster rate of decline in renal function compared to monotherapy. The ONTARGET trial also showed that dual RAAS blockade led to worsening of kidney function (Mann et al. 2008). As with ONTARGET, the VA NEPHRON D Trial, targeting patients with T2DM, compared combination therapy of losartan and lisinopril to monotherapy with losartan. Due to excess adverse events in the combination arm of ACEI and ARB, mostly acute kidney injury and hyperkalemia, the trial was prematurely stopped (Fried et al. 2013).",

Inhibition of neprilysin is accompanied by the increase in NP levels but has mild effects on BP (MacKinnon et al. 2006). The combination of a neprilysin inhibitor with a RAAS blocker represents a powerful tool. LCZ696 is a dual-acting ARB and neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) that decreases BP in animals and healthy humans with low rates of side effects. Therefore, it is not surprising that in CKD animals treated with LCZ, there was a significant improvement in indices of oxidative stress, inflammation, fibrosis, and the Nrf2 system beyond that observed with ARB therapy alone. In a clinical study, a meta-analysis of LCZ696 revealed that it was better than ARB alone at reducing most blood pressure parameters without resulting in more adverse events in treating hypertension (Jing et al. 2017).

However, large multicenter randomized controlled studies are needed to evaluate the beneficial effects and to explore the efficacy and safety of these new blockers of the RAAS.",
