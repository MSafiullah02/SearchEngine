Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and transfer RNA (tRNA) exhibit the most and diverse modifi cations that presumably optimize their structure and function. In contrast, oxidative damage can lead to random modifi cations in rRNA and messenger RNA (mRNA) that strongly impair functionality. RNA modifi cations have also been implicated in avoiding self-RNA recognition by the immune system or immune evasion by pathogens. Here, we describe the detection of RNA modifi cations by HPLC analysis and competitive ELISA.",

In the case of 2\u2032-O-ribose methylation of rRNA, the methyltransferase (2\u2032-O-MTase) fi brillarin utilizes small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), so-called Box C/D snoRNAs that guide the enzyme complex to complementary regions of the rRNA for methylation [ 2 ] . Base methylation of rRNA and tRNA as well as 2\u2032-O-ribose methylation of tRNA are carried out by position/sequence-specifi c methyltransferases independent of snoRNAs. For example, in E. coli uracil-5-methyltransferase (trmA) and guanine-7-methyltransferase (yggH/trmB) methylate specifi c bases in tRNA such as uridine 54 (m5U54) or guanosine 46 (m7G46), respectively [ 3 -5 ] .

For preparing buffer A dissolve 0.385 g of ammonium acetate in 50 ml H 2 O and adjust pH value with 10 % glacial acetic acid to pH 6.0. To sterilize solution use a 0.2 \u03bcm disposable fi lter (Kobe, Germany) and fi ltrate into 950 ml HPLC grade H 2 O. 2. For all buffers HPLC gradient grade solution should be used. Adhere to professional storage, handling, and disposal of buffers. Buffers can be stored at room temperature. All chemicals used for buffers were supplied from Carl Roth, Germany. 3. Guanosine and methylated derivatives should be dissolved in buffer A whereas adenosine and methylated derivatives are more soluble in H 2 O. Solubility is enhanced by increasing temperature up to 50 \u00b0C and ultrasonic treatment. Other nucleosides can be dissolved in H 2 O or buffer A. For long-term storage, aliquot nucleosides and freeze at \u221220 \u00b0C.
