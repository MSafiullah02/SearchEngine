We developed predictive models using patient demographic and clinical data collected during those first 4 hours. Eight hospitals were used for development and internal validation (n = 932) and 1 hospital for model external validation (n = 240). Predictive variables were identified using an ensemble approach that included univariate regression, random forest, logistic regression with LASSO, Chi-square testing, gradient boosting information gain, and gradient boosting Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) values prior to manual curation. We generated two predictive models, a quick COVID-19 severity index (qCSI) that uses only exam and vital sign measurements, and a COVID-19 severity index (CSI) machine learning model. Using area under receiver operating characteristic (AU-ROC), precision-recall curves (AU-PRC) and calibration metrics, we compare the qCSI and CSI to three illness scoring systems: Elixhauser mortality score, qSOFA, and CURB-65. We present performance of qCSI and CSI on an external validation cohort.",

            "text": "The SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID- 19) is increasingly understood to be a disease with a significant rate of critical illness. International reports of intensive care unit (ICU) utilization frequencies have varied from less than 10% to above 30%. [1] [2] [3] There are now reports from larger ICU cohorts, but these do not report a denominator of total COVID-19 population. 4, 5 More recently, a large New York City, USA case series was presented, of which 14.2% of patients with known outcomes were admitted to the ICU. 6 Preliminary data from a second New York City, USA cohort had an ICU rate of 32.5%. 7 While there is a growing body of data about critically ill cohorts and outcomes, less is known about risk factors for critical illness, especially as they relate to respiratory status. Oxygen saturation and inflammatory markers including d-dimer, ferritin, and C-reactive protein (CRP) have been identified as potentially associated with critical illness. 7 Predictive models advance the purposes of risk factor analysis and, ideally, lay the groundwork for the assignment of individualized illness probabilities. A number of diagnostic and prognostic prediction models for COVID-19 have been proposed, but the included cohorts were small and at significant risk for bias. 8 In this work, we expand on previous efforts describing critical COVID-19 illness in three ways. First, we describe the prevalence of patient respiratory deterioration early (< 24 hours) during hospitalization. While clinical decompensation can occur at any point during a hospitalization, we focus on early escalations in oxygen requirements, which have significant implications for resource utilization and anticipatory guidance for patients and families. Of particular note is the need for urgent patient re-evaluation of patients on general medical wards in consideration of higher levels of care. This process is personnel intensive, often including ward providers, a rapid response team, and intensive care consultants, and can lead to use of multiple care areas at a time when hospital censuses are already stretched. 9, 10 Second, to aid healthcare providers in assessing illness severity in COVID-19 positive patients, we present two predictive models of early respiratory decompensation during hospitalization: the quick COVID-19 severity index (qCSI) and a machine learning-derived COVID-19 Severity Index (CSI). These models were built on data extracted from the first four hours of care. We compare the predictive capabilities of our model to three benchmarks accessible using data in our electronic health record: the Elixhauser comorbidity mortality score, 11 the quick sequential organ failure assessment (qSOFA) 12, 13 , and the CURB-65 pneumonia severity score. 14 While many clinical risk models exist, these benefit from wide clinical acceptability and relative model parsimony as they require minimal input data for calculation. The Elixhauser comorbidity score was derived to enable prediction of hospital death using administrative data. 11 The qSOFA score was included in SEPSIS-3 guidelines and can be scored at the bedside as it includes respiratory rate, mental status, and systolic blood pressure. 12 The CURB-65 pneumonia severity score has been well-validated for hospital disposition, but its utility in both critical illness and COVID-19 is, as of yet, unclear. 14, 15 Third, we make the qCSI available to the public via a web interface at covidseverityindex.org. This web portal hosts the parsimonious model and allows for user entry of the required clinical values.",

The healthcare system is comprised of a mix of pediatric (n = 1), suburban community (n = 6), urban community (n = 2), and urban academic (n = 1) emergency departments. Data from eight hospitals were used in the creation and internal validation of the predictive model, while data from the last site was withheld for external validation. We adhered to the Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) and STROBE checklists. 16, 17 Data collection and processing Patient demographics, summarized past medical histories, vital signs, outpatient medications, chest x-ray (CXR) reports, and laboratory results available during the ED encounter were extracted from our local Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership data repository and analyzed within our computational health platform. 18 Data were collected Non-physiologic values likely related to data entry errors for vitals were converted to missing values based on expertguided rules (available in supplemental code files). Laboratory values at minimum or maximum thresholds and encoded with \"<\" or \">\" were converted to the numerical threshold value and other non-numerical values were dropped. Past medical histories were generated by using diagnoses prior to the date of admission to exclude new diagnoses. Outpatient medications were mapped to their respective First DataBank Enhanced therapeutic classification system. 19 CXR reports were manually reviewed by two physicians and categorized as \"no opacity\", \"unilateral opacity\", or \"bilateral opacities\". One hundred x-ray reports were reviewed by both physicians to determine inter-rater agreement with weighted kappa.",

We excluded patients less than 18 years of age and those who met our critical illness criteria at any point within four hours of presentation. The latter of these criteria was intended to exclude patients for whom critical illness was nearly immediately apparent to the medical provider and for whom a prediction would not be helpful.

We used SHAP methods to understand the importance of various clinical variables in the CSI ( Figure 2 ). 24, 29-31 SHAP values are an extension of the game-theoretic Shapley values that seek to describe variable impacts on model output, as defined as the contribution of a specific variable to the prediction itself. 29 The key advantage of the related SHAP values is that they add interpretability to complex models like gradient boosting, which otherwise provide opaque outputs. SHAP values are dimensionless and represent the marginal contribution a variable makes on a single prediction. In the case of our gradient boosting CSI model, we employ an isotonic regression step for model calibration, so the SHAP values provide a relative weighting of contributions. 32 Calculating the average absolute value over SHAP values suggests the most important variables in a given modelfor the CSI these were flow rate by nasal cannula, followed by lowest documented pulse oximetry, and AST (fig: featureimportance). Consistent with prior studies, we also observed utility to inflammatory markers, ferritin, procalcitonin, and CRP. We then explored how ranges of individual feature values affected model output 2). For example, low oxygen flow rates (blue) are protective as indicated by negative SHAP values, as are high pulse oximetry values (red). To better investigate clinical variable effects on predicted patient risk, we generated individual variable SHAP value plots (3). Age displayed a nearly binary risk distribution with an inflection point between 60 and 70 years of age. Younger patients displayed a higher risk of 24 hour critical illness than did older patients. We also observed that elevated AST, ALT, and ferritin were associated with elevated model risk, but the SHAP values reached their asymptotes well before the maximum value for each of these features. AST and ALT SHAP values reached their maximum within normal or slightly elevated ranges for these laboratory tests. The inflection point in risk attributable to ferritin levels, however, was close to 1000 ng/mL, above institutional normal range for this test (30-400 ng/mL).",

We used six parallel approaches to identify a subset of variables for the final qCSI and CSI models. The qCSI ultimately requires only three variables, all of which are accessible at the bedside. Using this model and the calibration results on the external cohort, we proposed that a qCSI score of 3 or less be considered low-likelihood for 24 hour respiratory critical illness. We note that few patients in the validation cohort had qCSI of 3 (SpO2 of 89-92% and respiratory rates of 23-28 without any oxygen requirement) -these patients may be found to have higher risk in future studies.",

CSI, however, offers opportunities to perform further analysis of potential COVID-19 prognostic factors. In alignment with current hypotheses about COVID-19 severity, we note that multiple variable selection techniques identified inflammatory markers including CRP and ferritin as potentially important predictors. More striking however, was the importance of aspartate (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in CSI predictions as calculated with SHAP values. 34, 35 Lower age had higher SHAP values, suggesting potential bias in the admitted patient cohort -young, admitted patients may be more ill than older admitted COVID-19 patients. Interestingly, the transition point where the SHAP value analysis identified model risk associated with liver chemistries was at the high end of normal, consistent with previous observations that noted that normal to mild liver dysfunction among COVID-19 patients. We hypothesize that the asymptotic quality of the investigated variables with respect to CSI risk contributions reflects our moderate study size and we expect that scaling CSI training to larger cohorts will further elucidate the impacts of more extreme values on risk. While our dataset included host risk factors including smoking history, obesity, and BMI, these did not appear to play a prominent role in predicting deterioration. Here, we recognize two important considerations: first, that predictive factors may not be mechanistic or causative factors in disease, and second that these factors may be related to disease severity without providing predictive value for 24 hour decompensation.",

We found high inter-rater agreement in this coding, but CXR were not consistently identified by our variable selection models. Further studies using natural language processing of radiology reports or direct analysis of CXR with tools like convolutional neural networks will provide more evidence regarding utility of these studies in COVID-19 prognostication. 38 Furthermore, we do not consider other applications of CXR including the identification of other pulmonary findings like diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia.",

The CSI may lend itself to a \"living\" model framework where the addition of new features, weights, and outcomes will improve its predictive capability. 8, 39 We hypothesize that the CSI will continue to improve as compared to the qCSI as more patient observations are included. Second, we expect related models to be extended to patient admission decisions as well as continuous hospital monitoring. [40] [41] [42] The qCSI does not separate patients without any nasal cannula requirement from those with even a minimal oxygen requirement. We expect that future models for safe discharge of COVID-19 patients will more strongly weigh even low oxygen requirements as local practice patterns may likely necessitate admission of any patient on exogenous oxygen. Patient prognosis has important ramifications in terms of resource utilization, hospital placement, and patient shared decision-making. We additionally note the role of respiratory parameters in selecting patients for therapeutic interventions. An early proof-of-concept study for the viral RNA polymerase inhibitor Remdesivir, which has in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2, included patients with pulse oximetry of \u2264 94% on ambient air or who had any oxygen requirement. 43 There is a large ongoing clinical trial that uses similar inclusion criteria (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04292899). A 237 patient Chinese trial of the same drug was stopped early after no further eligible patients were available for enrollment. 44 This study included patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection by RT-PCR, pneumonia on imaging, oxygen saturation of \u2264 94% on ambient air, or a partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen ratio of 300 mm Hg or less. Improved pragmatic, prognostic tools like the qCSI may offer a route to expanded inclusion criteria for ongoing trials or for early identification of patients who might potentially benefit from therapeutics.",
