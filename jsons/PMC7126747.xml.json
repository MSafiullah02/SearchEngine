Since then, MERS-CoV has been thought to represent a potential threat to global public health. As of December 22, 2015, a total of 1621 MERS cases from 26 countries have been reported, resulting in 584 (36.0%) deaths (http://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/). Accumulating evidence suggests that dromedary camels serve as an intermediate reservoir for human MERS-CoV infections. However, much remains unclear about the prevalence and evolution of MERS-CoV in dromedary camels, as well as the routes of MERS-CoV transmission. A recent study in Science by Sabir et al.\n[1] reports an extensive surveillance for MERS-CoV in dromedary camels and provides new insights into the evolution and transmission of MERS-CoV.",

MERS-CoV belongs to the clade C of Betacoronavirus. Sabir et al.\n[1] provide a snapshot of the CoV diversity in dromedary camels. They found that 25.3% of camels were positive for CoVs and identified three different CoV species, including MERS-CoV, \u03b21-HKU23-CoV (Betacoronavirus clade A), and camelid \u03b1-CoV (Alphacoronavirus). The co-infection of MERS-CoV and camelid \u03b1-CoV appears to be frequent. The high prevalence of these CoVs (12.1% and 19.8% for MERS-CoV and camelid \u03b1-CoV, respectively) indicates that they are enzoonotic in dromedary camels.",

This result suggests multiple lineages have been co-circulating, a prerequisite for recombination to occur. As with other positive-sense RNA viruses, recombination did occur among MERS-CoV strains. Sabir et al.\n[1] identified at least six recombination events, indicating recombination is frequent in MERS-CoV. Most surprisingly, one lineage (designated lineage 5 by Sabir et al.), which is associated with the recent Riyadh outbreak and the human infections in South Korea and China, has a recombinant origin. This recombinant lineage originated between December 2013 and June 2014, but has quickly become predominant in Saudi Arabian camels since November 2014. It raises a potential link between recombination and increased pathogenicity, which merits further investigation.",

The former three routes have been well accepted 3, 4. In the Sabir et al. study [1], the high prevalence again suggests that MERS-CoV is enzootic in dromedary camels and could be transmitted among camels. However, the human-to-camel transmission is theoretically possible but largely ignored [5], because of the obsession of animals as sources of human viruses. Recent studies reveal influenza A virus can be transmitted from human to a range of animal species (especially swine), a phenomenon known as reverse zoonosis [6]. For another CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), reverse zoonosis has been reported in cats and pigs [7]. When inspecting Sabir et al.\u2019s phylogenetic trees of MERS-CoV (Figures 1, S2, and S3 in [1]), we found many viruses of camel origin fell within the diversity of human viruses. There are two possible explanations for this phylogenetic pattern: (i) It is artifact due to sampling bias, if many camel viral strains are not sampled. If this is the case, we must miss substantial diversity of MERS-CoV and should expand our surveillance in camels to fully capture the MERS-CoV diversity. (ii) MERS-CoV could be transmitted from humans to camels, which means that humans serve as a source of MERS-CoV for camels. The role of camels in generating and maintaining MERS-CoV diversity has been repeatedly emphasized [1]. If human-to-camel transmission occurs, it requires us to refine our concept of the definition of a \u2018breeding ground\u2019 for MERS-CoV, which has important practical implications for developing vaccination strategies and control measures.",

In contrast, the phylogenetic tree of MERS-CoV from Sabir et al.\n[1] suggests tens of independent transmission events (Figures 1, S2, and S3 in [1]). It follows that the barrier of human-animal transmission is relatively lower for MERS-CoV.

Comparing the pathogenicity of parental and recombinant strains might help resolve this question. (ii) Does human-to-camel transmission occurs in MERS-CoV? The phylogenetic analysis of Sabir et al. suggests this possibility. Also, there are some other clues for this type of transmission [5], but rigorous experimental evidence is still needed. (iii) Are there other intermediate hosts for MERS-CoV? To date, other than camels, sheep, cows, and chickens have been detected for MERS-CoV infections. But none of them show serological evidence of MERS-CoV infection [9]. Nevertheless, more animal species should be sampled. (iv) What is the mechanisms underlying the difference of interspecies transmission between SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV? Both ecological and molecular mechanisms [e.g., the usage of different receptors, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for SARS-CoV and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for MERS-CoV] might contribute to this difference.",
