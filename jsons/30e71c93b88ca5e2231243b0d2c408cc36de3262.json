The burden of acute respiratory failure is high in terms of mortality and morbidity as well as the cost of its principal treatment, mechanical ventilation. Very few epidemiologic studies have evaluated the prevalence and outcome of acute respiratory failure and mechanical ventilation in general. Most of the published literature has focused on specific forms of acute respiratory failure, particularly acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) . In this chapter, we provide a brief review of the pathophysiology of acute respiratory failure, its definition and classification, and then present the incidence and outcomes of specific forms of acute respiratory failure from epidemiologic studies.",

            "text": "Normal respiration requires the integrated function of several components of the respiratory system (Fig. 1) . Dysfunction of any component results in the impairment of normal gas exchange and may lead to acute respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation. According to the underlying pathophysiologic mechanism, acute respiratory failure is usually divided into four patterns: Types I-IV ( Ta ble 1). Type I and type II respiratory failure are also referred to as hypoxemic and hyper- capnic respiratory failure, based on a predominant gas exchange abnormality. In many disease states however, more than one pathophysiologic mechanism is operational and clinical criteria that incorporate setting, acuity, and severity are used more often ( Table 1) . Acute episodes (exacerbations) of respiratory failure in patients with chronic compensated respiratory insufficiency are usually referred to as 'acute on chronic' respiratory failure. A consensus definition of acute respiratory failure is not available and most studies have used the combination of mechanical ventilation (of variable duration) with or without evidence of severe hypoxemia on arterial blood gas analysis. While some studies utilized a more strict definition than others, the essential component in all has been the need for mechanical ventilation. The indications for mechanical ventilation , however, are mostly based on clinical observations (increased respiratory rate, use of accessory muscles, paradoxical chest wall movements, changes in mental state), none of which has sufficient accuracy or precision. Therefore, the epidemiology of acute respiratory failure has so far been restricted to 'treated' acute respiratory failure, possibly explaining the wide variations in the reported incidence and outcomes of acute respiratory failure and associated clinical syndromes. Since the availability of intensive care and mechanical ventilation vary greatly in different parts of the world, the burden of acute respiratory failure may be severely underestimated depending on the access to leu services.",

Two European studies , one conducted in Germany [I] and the other in Sweden, Denmark, and Iceland [2] , estimated very similar incidences, 88.6 and 77.6 cases per 100,000 person-years. Both studies used an identical definition (intubation and mechanical ventilation for > 24 h regardless of arterial blood gas findings) and employed a multicenter approach with large patient cohorts over a short period (8 weeks). On the other hand, Behrendt reported a much higher incidence of acute respiratory failure in the USA, 137.1 per 100,000 patient-years. This incidence was estimated based on the ICD-9-CM disease codes for diagnoses and treatment in patients > 5 yrs old observed over a l-year period [3] . The significant variation between the US and European incidences may in part be explained by the differences in study design ( Table 2 ) and in part by incons istent indications and access to mechanical ventilation in different countries. Acute respiratory failure is often accompanied or followed by a failure of other vital organs, and death most often occurs becau se of multiorgan failure (MOF) and the withdrawal of mechan ical ventilati on when the chances for a meaningful recovery of the patient's qual ity of life are deemed to be exceedingly low. Imprecision of clinical prognostic criteria, variations in available resources, and patient and provider preferences limit the interpretation of mortality data from different epidemiologic studies.",

Lewandowski and coworkers [1] studied 476 patients from 72 ICUs in Berlin, Germany and reported mortality rates of 36-58 % depending on the lung injury score (LIS). In a large prospective study from Scandinavia, Luhr and coworkers reported an all-cause 90-day mortality of 41 % [2] . In a large, prospective international cohort involving 361 ICUs, Esteban and coworkers reported an ICU mortality of 30.7 %. Mortality increased significantly in patients with sepsis, shock, ARDS, or liver failure [4] . Vincent and coworkers used sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score criteria and the need for mechanical ventilation to define acute respiratory failure and estimated an overall ICU mortality of 31 %. The mortality was much lower (7 %) when the lung was the only organ involved [5] . Recently, Flaatten and coworkers reported the mortality from acute respiratory failure at different time points after disease onset . Mortality was again the lowest in single organ acute respiratory failure and rose with each add itional organ failure. Higher mortality rates were found 90 days after the onset compared to at ICU or hospital discharge [6] . MOF following an ICU admission , presence of circulatory shock on ICU admission , older age, and pre-existing comorbidities (cirrhosis, malignancy and chronic renal failure) were independent risk factors for the mortality rate reported in several studies [4, [7] [8] [9] .",

ALI is a major cause of acute respiratory failure in the ICU and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Since it was first described by Ashbaugh and colleagues [10] and than redefined in 1994 [11] , there have been significant advances in the understanding of etiology, pathophysiology, and the epidemiology of ALI. Clinical risk factors for ALI are usually divided into direct (pulmonary) and indirect (extrapulmonary). Pneumonia, aspiration, lung contusion; and inhalation injury are the principal pulmonary risk factors, while sepsis, shock, trauma, pancreatitis, and multiple transfusions represent the most important extrapulmonary risk factors. In recent years, transfusion-related ALI (TRALI) and novel viral pathogens (severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARSj) have emerged as important risk factors for ALI.",

The 1972 report of the National Heart and Lung Institute Task Force on Respiratory Diseases, estimated 150,000 cases of ARDS per year yielding the annual incidence of 75 per 100,000 person-years . Subsequent studies reported an incidence of All ranging from 16 to 34 cases per 100,000 person-years in European countries [2, 12] and Australia [13] , and a much higher incidences of ALI in the USA, 78 per 100,000 persons-years (190,600 cases per year) [13] [14] [15] . While a significant minority of patients with All is treated with non-invasive ventilation (NIV), the majority of studies included only patients treated with invasive ventilation. A recently completed, retrospective, community cohort study in Olmsted County, Minnesota included patients treated with NIV and found an even higher incidence of ALI, 156 per 100,000 person-years (personal communication, Rodrigo Cartin -Ceba), Mortality from ALI varies greatly depending upon the age of the patient, underlying chronic illnesses, ALI risk factors, and non-pulmonary organ dysfunctions [15] . Two decades ago, the mortality rate from ALI ranged from 50 -70 % [4, 8, 16, 17] , but has since declined and more recently has been estimated to be about 30-50 % [2, 13, 15, 23] . Advances in general supportive care [9] and the use of new mechanical ventilation strategies [16] may account for most of the change.",

More severe gas exchange abnormalities and longer hospital stays were associated with the hospital mortalities. Long-term mortality was associated with longer disease duration, lower serum albumin, low body mass index, and lower Pa02' MOF and sepsis were the most common immediate causes of death in patients with acute exacerbation of COPD admitted to the ICU. In another prospective study of 250 patients with acute exacerbation of COPD [34] , invasive mechanical ventilation was started in 60 % and NIV was tried in 40 % of patients and was successful in 54 % of them. Median duration of ventilation was 6 days. After several clinical tr ials reported improved outcomes [35] , NIV has become the principal init ial mode for providing mechanical ventilation to patients with acute exacerbation of COPD [36] . Since the indications for NIV are more liberal than those of invasive ventilation, it is difficult to directly compare the outcomes of mechanically ventilated patients treated with the two modes. In a study by Girou et al., however, adjusted odds of death (0.37; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0.18-0.78) suggested that the mortality in patients with similar severity of illness treated with NIV was significantly lower.",

In a retrospective review [39] of 75 patients with interstitial lung disease who were mechanically ventilated at Mayo Clinic from 2003 to 2005, acute respiratory failure was the most common cause of ICU admiss ion (77 %), followed by sepsis (11 %) and cardiopulmonary arrest (4 %). Seventeen patients were initially treated with NIV but eventually all patients required invasive mechanical ventilation. Hospital mortality was 49 %. Patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis tended to have a higher mortality rate than non -idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis forms of interstitial lung disease. Conventional lung protective mechanical ventilation was not associated with improved outcome. Worsening hypoxemia and higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) settings were associated with increased mortality. In an earlier study, Saydain and coworkers observed the clinical course of 38 patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis admitted to the ICU. Acute respiratory failure was the most common reason for ICU admission. While 49 % of the patients survived to hospital discharge, 12 of 13 survivors (92 %) died within 2 months after hospital discharge [40] .",
