            "text": "Two categories of neutropenic fevers have been described. Microbiologically-based NPF infection is defined when the cultures isolate an organism. On the other hand clinically documented NPF is present when there is a high clinical suspicion for infection based on physical examination findings or radiological testing but there is a negative microbiologic work up. During the work up of NPF, an infectious origin can be identified either microbiologically and/or clinically in only 30\u201350% of the cases [2]. This is often related to an incomplete medical exam or untimely collection of specimens such as biopsies or aspirations due to concomitant thrombocytopenia. These patients tend to improve after empiric antibiotic therapy which suggests an occult infection. However other non-infectious causes of fever such as chemotherapy induced mucositis, tumor fever, transfusion related fever, drug fever, or graft-versus-host disease should also be considered as potential causes of unexplained fever [3]. Tumor fever is in part thought to be related to cytokine release by the cancer cells, and it is usually a diagnosis of exclusion. Drug fever is not uncommon particularly from certain chemotherapies or growth factors. A thorough detail orientated history, medication reconciliation and physical exam is important in identifying patterns between medications and fever curves. Drug fever should be suspected in the presence of rash, peripheral eosinophilia and increasing transaminases. These associated symptoms are not always present.",

It often develops when there is an ongoing mucosal barrier injury that results from the toxic effects of chemotherapy allowing for either micro- or macro-translocation of bacterial organisms from the GI tract into the systemic system. Micro-translocation leads mainly to an inflammatory syndrome with negative blood cultures but punctuated with NPF whereas macro-translocation presents with positive blood cultures. Chemotherapy induced mucositis and less frequently radiation induced mucositis can involve the entire gastrointestinal tract including the oral cavity. Studies have shown that it may be more important as a cause of infection than neutropenia itself in cancer patients [4].",

Myeloid reconstitution syndrome is similar to immune reconstitution syndrome seen in HIV patients after initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) . With the addition of ART, there is a shift from an immunosuppressed state to a pro-inflammatory state. In the setting of hematological malignancies, it occurs within 15 days of neutrophil recovery and manifests as fevers. Superinfection needs to be ruled out in these circumstances prior to considering discontinuing antimicrobials [5]. Engraftment syndrome, more commonly seen in patients undergoing autologous stem cell transplants than SCT, develop fevers, rash and pulmonary infiltrates at the beginning of engraftment; i.e. neutrophil recovery. If the patient has an aggressive and symptomatic engraftment syndrome, steroids can be considered. Patients with breast cancer, previous monotherapy and recent use of G- CSF appear to have higher risk for this syndrome [6].",

There has been an increased frequency in bacteremias with gram-negative organisms compared to gram positive, with Enterobacteriaceae sp. being more predominant, followed by P. aeruginosa and other gram negatives. Unfortunately, the use of prophylactic antibiotics has led to an increase in frequency of resistant pathogens such as extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Enterobacteriaceae and carbapenem resistant pathogens. Gram positive bacteria continue to be an important cause of bacteremia. Staphylococcus aureus including Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), coagulase negative staphylococcus, viridans group streptococcus and Enterococci, especially vancomycin resistant Enterococcus (VRE) are particularly concerning [2]. Anaerobic bacteria are not as common but have been associated with a polymicrobial bacteremia and in those patients undergoing abdominal surgery. Fungal infections are less common compared to bacterial infections as the cause of fever early in the course of neutropenia. When they are identified, Aspergillus sp. and Candida sp. are the most common. Non C. albicans strains are increasing in frequency due to selective pressure from the ongoing use of prophylactic fluconazole [2]. The greatest risk factor for mold infection is profound and prolonged neutropenia (i.e. 14 days or more with ANC < 100).",

            "text": "In terms of antimicrobial prophylaxis there is a three-pronged approach. The first prong is antibacterial. The second is antifungal and the third is antiviral [1]. Traditionally antibacterial prophylaxis is utilized to prevent first and foremost an invasive Pseudomonas (PSA) infection, thus the use of ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin. Levofloxacin is the best choice if there is a concomitant need for viridans group streptococcus (VGS) due to dental or gingival issues. If a patient has prolonged QT corrected or is intolerant of a fluoroquinolone, the alternative option for antibacterial prophylaxis is cefdinir or cefpodoxime [1]. Unfortunately, with this approach, there is an increased risk for pseudomonas bacteremia due to the lack of coverage with oral cephalosporins. Primary prophylaxis is recommended for patients who are at high risk for febrile neutropenia or with profound and protracted neutropenia (ANC \u2264100 for >7 days), such as patients with AML/MDS or SCT treated with myeloablative conditioning regimens. Current guidelines do not recommend routine prophylaxis in patients with low risk neutropenia such as those with solid tumors [1, 7]. Due to the increase of multidrug resistant organisms (MDROs) there are regions of the world including the northeast of the US where the rates are higher for drug resistance for PSA as well as other gram-negative rods (GNRs) making the use of antibacterial prophylaxis useless and only increases the risk of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) (Tables 2 and 3).",

It is important to risk stratify to adequately estimate the pre-test probability of invasive yeast infection versus mold infection in neutropenic patients. For example, an acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) undergoing induction chemotherapy would be a candidate for voriconazole primary prophylaxis due to the risk of neutropenia in a patient expecting neutropenic longer than 14 days (a known risk factor for invasive mold infection). Prophylaxis against invasive Aspergillus sp. infections with posaconazole is considered for patients \u226513 years of age, and undergoing intense chemotherapy for AML or MDS [1]. On the other hand, an impending neutropenic patient for SCT may have duration of neutropenia less than 14 days thus fluconazole or an echinocandin would be sufficient for prophylaxis against Candida sp. Antifungal prophylaxis is recommended for patients expected to have profound, protracted neutropenia such as patients with AML/MDS or SCT patients [1]. Similar to antibacterial prophylaxis, anti-mold prophylaxis is not recommended for solid tumors. Regimens associated with an increased risk of infection by Pneumocystis jirovecii such as those patients on purine analogues or those on \u226520 mg of prednisone for more than 1 month should receive trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole ideally in daily dosing to increase compliance. If intolerant or allergic to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole then alternatives such as dapsone, atovaquone or aerosolized pentamidine can be considered [1]. Prior to utilizing dapsone, ensuring the patient has a sufficient level of G6PD is recommended.",

For example, if voriconazole was used to treat a fungal pneumonia during induction chemotherapy, one should consider restarting voriconazole for secondary prophylaxis for the impending neutropenia expected during SCT [1, 8].",

Additional gram-positive coverage is recommended only when there is suspicion of a gram-positive producing infection such as line infection or soft tissue infection where the addition of IV vancomycin is indicated [1]. Empiric NPF regimens are designed to be adjusted based on patient risk factors i.e. known ESBL colonization and the need for empiric meropenem. Traditionally if the patient is colonized with MRSA, there is the consideration of empiric 48 h use of IV vancomycin, linezolid or daptomycin. If the patient is colonized with vancomycin resistant enterococcus (VRE) then there is a consideration of 48 h of empiric daptomycin or linezolid use for NPF.

These patients are then candidates for inpatient therapy [1]. On the other hand, patients with febrile neutropenia who are expected to have a short duration of neutropenia and none/few comorbidities would therefore be considered low risk. Low risk patients are then considered candidates for outpatient therapy. There are several tools that have been validated to supplement clinical decision making: MASCC index, Talcott\u2019s rules or CISNE (specifically for solid tumors presenting with NPF). These tools are designed to augment clinical decision making but if the patient is deemed unstable for discharge by a treating physician from an emergency room then regardless of the score, the patient would need admission to the hospital [8]. Also those patients infected with a resistant pathogen will have a higher pretest probability of admission due to the difficulty in organizing intravenous antimicrobials from an emergency room setting. Afebrile patients who have new signs or symptoms suggestive of an infection that are considered high-risk would automatically be candidates for inpatient therapy [2, 7].",

Antiviral therapy is indicated in febrile neutropenia only if there is strong clinical or laboratory evidence of a viral infection.

In the setting of an unexplained fever, the initial therapy should be continued until there is marrow recovery i.e. ANC >500. In the case of a documented infection, therapy depends on the site of infection and or organism isolated. Antibiotics (whether prophylaxis or treatment) are continued until the ANC > 500 or if they received an appropriate duration of therapy for that particular infection, then they can be switched to prophylactic antibiotics for the remaining duration of neutropenia [1].

Multiple microbiology labs have invested into an array of platforms that help facilitate the rapid diagnosis of bacteremias. The previous paradigm was monitoring blood cultures continuously for up to 5 days or at least until they turned positive. Once the blood culture turned positive, an initial sample was assessed via a gram stain. Simultaneously the sample is plated with the goal of growing a pure colony to run through a VITEK II allowing for the assessment of antimicrobial sensitivities as well as placing a sample in one of many types of PCR platforms. Based on the example of the BioFire\u00a9, the turnaround time for the blood culture identification (BCID) panel is approximately 1 h. after only 5 min of hands on time. This allows for the identification of the organism but unfortunately for sensitivities, one still has to wait for the pure culture to be selected out and run through the VITEK II [11]. The integration of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has further changed the face of microbiology by utilizing protein fingerprinting to diagnose organisms by use of referencing them against a database and various algorithms [12].",
