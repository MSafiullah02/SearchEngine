Unfortunately, point mutations have been identified in the S1 domain, so that the virus isolated in the future may not be recognized by these antibodies. As no mutation has been found in the S2 domain indicating that this region is more conserved than the S1 domain, it may be a better target for antibody binding. After predicting the immunogenicity of the epitopes of the S2 domain, we chemically synthesized two peptides and also expressed one of them using a recombinant DNA method. We screened a phage displaying library of human single-chain antibodies (ScFv) against the predicted epitopes and obtained a human ScFv which can recognize the SARS virus in vitro.",

Reactivity with SARS-CoV-infected cells by scFvs was assessed by indirect immunofluorescence. This test utilized BIOCHIP containing SARS-CoV-infected cells and non-infected cells positioned side by side in each reaction field. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that the scFv-A11 specifically recognized SARS-CoV infected ( fig. 6 A) but not uninfected Vero cells ( fig. 6 B) . Although the other 3 ScFvs (C6, C13, G10) bound S2b fusion protein on ELISA, they did not bind the infected Vero cells. The negative binding of G10 is shown in figure 6 E.",

Like other coronavirus, the SARS virus also uses its S1 domain of the spike protein to bind the receptor of the host cells. The best way to block the infection of the virus is to block the binding of the virus to the receptor. Although neutralization antibody against this domain has been developed, most mutations of the SARS virus have been found in this region, and hence some virus may escape recognition by the neutralization antibody. However, the S2 domain is very well conserved among all corona viruses and so far no mutation has been found in the S2 domain of SARS virus. Hence this region is a better target than the S1 domain for the development of vaccine and neutralization antibodies against the SARS virus. Furthermore, the combination of different neutralization antibodies against multiple epitopes may facilitate the clearance of virus from human blood.",
