Private entrepreneurs and foreign investors have played an important role in developing the manufacturing sector, China\u2019s principal growth engine. Even before 1978 the economy was heavily skewed towards manufacturing, but following the market-oriented transition output increased significantly. During this period there was a structural shift away from large state-owned enterprises (SOEs), although these still remain an important part of the economy. Between 1997 and 2003 the government oversaw reform of SOEs, with many poorly performing businesses privatized or liquidated. Stronger firms were restructured and often listed on the stock market. Many more recent enterprises are labour-intensive as distinct from the capital-intensive SOEs. Growth has been fuelled by low added value and labour-intensive exports.

Until 1970 the USA supported Taiwan\u2019s claims to represent all of China. Only in 1971 did the government of the People\u2019s Republic of China manage to replace that of Chiang Kai-shek at the UN. In Jan. 1979 the USA established formal diplomatic relations with the People\u2019s Republic of China, breaking off formal ties with Taiwan. Taiwan itself has continued to reject attempts at reunification, and although there have been frequent threats of direct action from mainland China (including military manoeuvres off the Taiwanese coast) the prospect of confrontation with the USA supports the status quo.",
