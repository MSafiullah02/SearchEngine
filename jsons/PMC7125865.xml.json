In addition, a large outbreak is currently occurring in North America (Canada and United States)5 and causing substantial hospitalisation of children with severe respiratory disease, some of them with acute neurologic illness.6 The circulation of EV-D68 in the general population seems to be low, although the risk of EV-D68 transmission in European countries remains moderate. In fact, epidemic clusters of severe disease by EV-D68 have not been still reported. Therefore, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) reminds of the need to be vigilant to new EV-D68 cases in Europe, particularly in severe hospitalised patients.",

Only the patients whose samples were studied by real-time multiplex RT-PCR (Anyplex II RV16 Detection Kit, Seegene, Korea), that allows the detection of the most prevalent respiratory viruses such as human adenovirus (hAdV), influenza A/B virus, human parainfluenza virus (hPIV) 1/2/3/4, rhinovirus (RV), human respiratory syncytial virus A/B, human bocavirus (hBoV) 1/2/3/4, human metapneumovirus, human coronavirus (hCoV) 229E/NL63/OC43 and human enterovirus (EV), were included in the present study. Among this heterogeneous group of patients, all cases with suspicion of viral ARI admitted to the units of Intensive Medicine, Onco-Hematology, Pneumology, Neurology and Neonatology were included to increase the chance to detect EV-D68 associated with severe respiratory disease. The specific EV detection was simultaneously performed by a commercial real-time RT-PCR (SmartEV, Cepheid, USA), not only to enhance EV detection, but also to avoid the likely false results due to the high genetic similarity between rhinoviruses and enterovirus (in particular for EV-D68).1 Institutional Review Board approval was obtained from the Hospital Universitari Vall d\u2019Hebron Clinical Research Ethics Committee. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences of partial EV VP1 region1 was carried out using MEGA v67 to determine the type of the detected enteroviruses. Sequences from previous molecular epidemiological studies were downloaded from GenBank (GB) Database to be included in the phylogenetic analysis (GB accession numbers are shown in the taxons of the phylogenetic tree) together with recent EV-D68 characterised in The Netherlands and USA.4 The molecular evolutionary models of nucleotide substitution were fitted to the multiple sequence alignment using evolutionary analyses conducted in MEGA v6.7 The phylogenetic tree was constructed using a neighbour-joining distance method as implemented in MEGA v6 with the evolutionary model with lowest Bayesian information Criterion score.7 The topological accuracy of the tree was evaluated by the bootstrap method (1000 replicates). The amino acid composition of partial VP1 amino acid sequences was studied using MEGA v6 relative to the homologous sequence of Fermon Strain with accession number AY426531.",

In addition, samples from 50 patients were laboratory-confirmed for RV (38/50), hAdV (4/50), hCoV-229E (1/50), hBoV (2/50) and hPIV-4 (4/50). Phylogenetic analysis of partial VP1 sequences (Fig. 1\n) confirmed that all detected enteroviruses were D68 serotype, which belonged to the phylogenetic major group 3 among the three clades circulating worldwide, as previously described.3, 4, 8 The VP1 nucleotide sequences were genetically close to the recent 2014 Dutch strains4 and to the strains of the large 2014 USA outbreak. In the comparison of VP1 amino acid sequences of strains belonging to the different EV-D68 clades (Table 1\n), the EV-D68 strains that fell into the major group 3 show some amino acid substitutions, including an amino acid deletion, with most of the differences located in the immunogenic BC- and DE-loops.9 The nucleotide sequences of the present study were submitted to GenBank Database with accession numbers KP090456\u2013KP090459 and KP122208.",

Therefore, four of the patients in our series had risk factors to develop severe respiratory infections, and EV-D68 acquisition was nosocomial in three patients, but only one suffered severe bronchiolitis that required mechanical ventilation (Table 2). Anyway, clinicians should be on the alert for severe respiratory illness in children that might be caused by infection with EV-D68 for an early diagnosis. Although there are no vaccines or specific treatments for EV-D68 infection, and clinical care is only supportive, the detection and identification of these viruses could help in explaining serious respiratory illness, giving guidance to medical care, preventing unnecessary treatment with antibiotics and adopting the isolation protocols to avoid the nosocomial transmission.",

Previously, in our laboratory Seegene's method was only used as the routine diagnostic method for the detection of respiratory viruses, including all EV serotypes, as commercially approved. But similar Seegene's products such as Seeplex\u00ae RV15ACE Detection kit (Seegene, Korea) did not seem to detect EV-D68 in a multi-centre study in the Netherlands.11 The decision to use it in parallel with a commercial EV-specific diagnostic test was made both to avoid false results as RV, and to assure the detection of the different known EV serotypes in order to accomplish with ECDC recommendations. The respiratory virus most frequently detected in the studied samples was RV, as expected for this period of the year, but none of these RV laboratory-confirmed samples were positive using Cepheid's EV-specific RT-PCR assay. It excluded the possibility that other EV, in particular EV-D68 cases, were wrongly identified as RV. However, the fact that Seegene's method is used by many European laboratories to detect EV in addition to other respiratory viruses suggests that the EV-D68 prevalence and its importance in Europe might therefore be underestimated.",
