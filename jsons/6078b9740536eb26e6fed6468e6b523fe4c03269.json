Vaccinia virus as a vector for the full-length IBV cDNA has the advantage that modifications can be introduced into the IBV cDNA using homologous recombination, a method frequently used to insert and delete sequences from the vaccinia virus genome. Here, we describe the use of transient dominant selection as a method for introducing modifications into the IBV cDNA that has been successfully used for the substitution of specific nucleotides, deletion of genomic regions, and exchange of complete genes. Infectious recombinant IBVs are generated in situ following the transfection of vaccinia virus DNA, containing the modified IBV cDNA, into cells infected with a recombinant fowlpox virus expressing T7 DNA-dependant RNA polymerase.",

Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses with a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of 26-32 kb, the largest genomes of all RNA viruses currently known, that replicate in the cytoplasm of infected cells. The genome associates with the nucleoprotein (N) forming a helical nucleocapsid within the virus particles.

According to a new market research report published by MarketsandMarkets, the global poultry meat market was worth $179,551.2 million in 2012 and is expected to reach $250,949.5 million by 2018. In a report, commissioned by Defra in 2005 [12] , IBV was indicated as a major cause of ill health among chickens and was implicated as being responsible for more economic loss in the UK poultry industry than any other disease [13, 14] ; IBV was estimated to cost the UK economy nearly \u00a319 million per year, mainly due to loss of egg production, with serious implications for animal welfare. The cost of control through vaccination is approximately \u00a35 million per year in the UK.",

Coronavirus genomes consist of single-stranded positive-sense RNA, and are the largest of all the RNA viruses ranging from approximately 27-32 kb; the genome of IBV is 27.6 kb. Molecular analysis of the role of individual genes in the pathogenesis of RNA viruses has been advanced by the availability of full-length cDNAs, for the generation of infectious RNA transcripts that can replicate and result in infectious viruses. The assembly of full-length coronavirus cDNAs was hampered due to regions from the replicase gene being unstable in bacteria. We therefore devised a reverse genetics strategy for IBV involving the insertion of a full-length cDNA copy of the IBV genome, under the control of a T7 RNA promoter, into the vaccinia virus genome in place of the thymidine kinase (TK) gene. A hepatitis \u03b4 ribozyme (H\u03b4R) is located downstream of the coronavirus poly(A) tail followed by a T7 termination sequence. IBV infectious RNA is generated from the T7 promoter immediately adjacent to the 5\u2032 end of the IBV cDNA using T7 RNA polymerase and terminates at the T7 termination sequence downstream of the H\u03b4R sequence, which autocleaves itself and the T7 termination sequence at the end of the poly(A) sequence, resulting in an authentic IBV genomic RNA copy. Infectious IBV is recovered in situ in cells both transfected with vaccinia virus DNA and infected with a recombinant fowlpox virus expressing T7 RNA polymerase [15] .",

A second and equally important advantage is the ability to modify the IBV cDNA within the vaccinia virus vector through transient dominant selection (TDS), a method taking advantage of recombinant events between homologous sequences [17, 18] . The TDS method relies on a three-step procedure. In the first step, the modified IBV cDNA is inserted into a plasmid containing a selective marker under the control of a vaccinia virus promoter. In our case we use a plasmid, pGPTNEB193 ( Fig. 1; [19] ), which contains a dominant selective marker gene, Escherichia coli guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (Ecogpt; [20] ), under the control of the vaccinia virus P7.5K early/late promoter.",

This occurs as a result of a single crossover event involving homologous recombination between the IBV cDNA in the plasmid and the IBV cDNA sequence in the vaccinia virus genome. Fig. 1 Schematic diagram of the recombination vector for insertion of genes into a vaccinia virus genome using TDS. Plasmid pGPTNEB193 contains the Ecogpt selection gene under the control of the vaccinia virus early/late P 7.5K promoter, a multiple cloning region for the insertion of the sequence to be incorporated into the vaccinia virus genome, and the bla gene (not shown) for ampicillin selection of the plasmid in E. coli. For modification of the IBV genome, a sequence corresponding to the region being modified, plus flanking regions of 500-800 nucleotides for recombination purposes, is inserted into the multiple cloning sites using an appropriate restriction endonuclease. The plasmid is purified from E. coli and transfected into Vero cells previously infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus containing a full-length cDNA copy of the IBV genome mycophenolic acid (MPA) in the presence of xanthine and hypoxanthine [17] . In the third step, the MPA-resistant rVVs are grown in the absence of MPA selection, resulting in the loss of the Ecogpt gene due to a second single homologous recombination event between the duplicated sequences (Fig. 3) . During this third step two recombination events can occur; one event will result in the generation of the original (unmodified) IBV sequence and the other in the generation of an IBV cDNA containing the desired modification (i.e., the modification within the plasmid sequence). In theory these two events will occur at equal frequency; however in practice this is not necessarily the case.",

The diagram shows a potential first single-step recombination event between the modified IBV sequence within pGPTNEB193 and the IBV cDNA within vNotI-IBVFL. In order to guarantee a single-step recombination event any potential recombinant vaccinia viruses are selected in the presence of MPA; only vaccinia viruses expressing the Ecogpt gene are selected. The main IBV genes are indicated, the replicase, spike (S), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) genes. The IBV gene 3 and 5 clusters that express three and two gene products, respectively, are also indicated. In the example shown a modified region of the S gene is being introduced into the IBV genome promoter, is co-transfected into the CK cells. Expression of T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of the IBV N protein and the rVV DNA, containing the full-length IBV cDNA under the control of a T7 promoter, results in the generation of infectious IBV RNA, which in turn results in the production of infectious rIBVs (Fig. 4) . Primary CK cells are refractory for growth of most IBV isolates; therefore rIBVs expressing S glycoproteins from such isolates cannot be recovered using CK cells. In order to recover such rIBVs, the supernatants from the transfected CK cells are used to infect 10-day-old embryonated hen's eggs. Allantoic fluid is collected and any potential virus passed a further three times in 10-day-old embryos. RNA is extracted from the allantoic fluid of infected eggs and RT-PCR followed by sequencing is used to confirm the identity of the rIBV.",

(a) In addition to the vaccinia virus DNA containing the full-length IBV cDNA under the control of a T7 promoter a plasmid, pCI-Nuc, expressing the IBV nucleoprotein, required for successful rescue of IBV, is transfected into CK cells previously infected with a recombinant fowlpox virus, FPV-T7, expressing T7 RNA polymerase. The T7 RNA polymerase results in the synthesis of an infectious RNA from the vaccinia virus DNA that consequently leads to the generation of infectious IBV being released from the cell. (b) Any recovered rIBV present in the media of P 0 CK cells is used to infect P 1 CK cells. The media is filtered through a 0.22 \u03bcm filter to remove any FPV-T7 virus. IBVinduced CPE is normally observed in the P 1 CK cells following a successful recovery experiment. Any rIBV is passaged a further two times, P 2 and P 3 , in CK cells. Total RNA is extracted from the P 1 -P 3 CK cells and the IBV-derived RNA analyzed by RT-PCR for the presence of the required modification 2 Materials ",

Vero cells are infected with rVV containing IBV cDNA and then transfected with a plasmid containing the IBV sequence to be inserted and the selective marker gene Ecogpt. Homologous recombination occurs and the complete plasmid sequence is inserted into the rVV. The Ecogpt gene allows positive selection of these rVV as it confers resistance to MPA in the presence of xanthine and hypoxanthine. The viruses are plaque purified three times in the presence of selection agents ensuring that no wild-type VV is present. The removal of the selection agents results in a second recombination event with the loss of the Ecogpt gene. Plaque purification in the absence of selection agents ensures not only the loss of the GPT gene but also the maintenance of a single viral population. Small stocks of rVV are grown from individual plaques which are screened through PCR for the desired modification; this is found in theoretically 50% of rVVs ",

Previous chapters and protocols have instructed during plaque purification in the absence of GPT selection agents to plate 10 \u22121 rVV dilution in the presence of GPT selection medium and rVV dilutions 10 \u22122 and 10 \u22123 in the absence.

The diagram shows a potential first single-step recombination event between the modified IBV sequence within pGPTNEB193 and the IBV cDNA within vNotI-IBVFL. In order to guarantee a single-step recombination event any potential recombinant vaccinia viruses are selected in the presence of MPA; only vaccinia viruses expressing the Ecogpt gene are selected. The main IBV genes are indicated, the replicase, spike (S), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) genes. The IBV gene 3 and 5 clusters that express three and two gene products, respectively, are also indicated. In the example shown a modified region of the S gene is being introduced into the IBV genome",

Integration of the complete pGPTNEB193 plasmid into the vaccinia virus genome results in an unstable intermediate because of the presence of tandem repeat sequences, in this example the 3\u2032 end of the replicase gene, the S gene, and the 5\u2032 end of gene 3. The second single-step recombination event is induced in the absence of MPA; loss of selection allows the unstable intermediate to lose one of the tandem repeat sequences including the Ecogpt gene. The second step recombination event can result in either (I) the original sequence of the input vaccinia virus IBV cDNA sequence, in this case shown as a recombination event between the two copies of the 3\u2032 end of the replicase gene which results in loss of the modified S gene sequence along with Ecogpt gene, or (II) retention of the modified S gene sequence and loss of the original S gene sequence and Ecogpt gene as a result of a potential recombination event between the two copies of the 5\u2032 end of the S gene sequence. This event results in a modified S gene sequence within the IBV cDNA in a recombinant vaccinia virus modified IBV cDNA(Fig. 5) and the recovery of infectious rIBV from the rVV vector (Fig. 4",
