In accordance with the aforementioned reports, the lesions found in our study indicated a septicaemic presentation, as confirmed by the isolation of S. Choleraesuis from nongastrointestinal organs, most notably lungs. This presentation is often related to an inhalatory transmission (Gray, Fedorka-Cray, Stabel, & Ackermann, 1995) which have been shown to be more frequent than oral (Clemmer, Hickey, Bridges, Schliessmann, & Shaffer, 1960) , especially in intensive breeding farms and in the summer months, due to the dryness of soil (Baskerville & Dow, 1973) . In our study, 18 of the 28 samples were collected in summer, similar to all the outbreaks reported previously in this species (Methner et al., 2010; Perez et al., 1999) , suggesting that dust and aerosols generated by sneezing could have a mayor impact in the transmission and dissemination of the disease in wild boars groups . (Pedersen et al., 2015) . Studies from United States showed higher rates of resistance to tetracyclines (92.6%) (Huang, Lin, & Wu, 2009 ) while data from Japan revealed multidrug resistant isolates with resistance to fluoroquinolones and cephalosporines (Asai et al., 2010; Chang et al., 2005; Chiu et al., 2004) . Other screening performed in wild boars from Germany revealed high resistance of S. Choleraesuis to sulphamethoxazole and streptomycin (Methner et al., 2010) whereas very high rates of resistance against streptomycin (73%), spiramicin, and tilmicosin (both at 100%) have been found in Italy (Donazzolo et al., 2017) .

The other estate from cluster A, F10, was located 44 km away from F4 and F9 but still in the same region. As mentioned above, F10 is a \"hunting farm\" that provides animals to other places and implements sanitary measures including antibiotics administration. F10 shared identical phenotypical resistance pattern with F4 and F9 but displayed the PFGE profile SC1. It should be mentioned that SC1 profile also appeared in F4 a few years later after the first outbreak was declared in this estate (Isolate R144), clearly supporting the hypothesis of genetic transfer between estates of this cluster. Regarding to cluster B, most of its isolates were classified into SC4. All the strains from this subgroup (SC4) lacked the flagellar antigen and presented the Kunzendorf variant. Besides, its phenotypical resistance pattern was much more limited than that from cluster A. Unlike SC4, strains from SC3 presented the flagellar antigen and showed different resistant patterns (genotypical and phenotypical) which could be due to a different evolution in their ecological niches, acquiring distinct resistances. Despite the high degree of similarity in cluster B (97%), there was no apparent geographical relation between the locations of the isolates in this group. This remarkable dispersion could be due to the ability of the strains of Salmonella to persist for long periods of time in asymptomatic carriers, as it was previously demonstrated in Germany (Methner et al., 2010) . Such persistence would explain the distance between isolates as well as the time between different cases.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1836, "end": 1858, "text": "(Methner et al., 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "| DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "GIL MOLINO ET AL.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "| DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "As concluding remarks, the special virulence observed in our data highlights the importance of the management-related stressors in this species.
