Broader tolerances may include physiological plasticity (such as thermal acclimation), which enables an animal to express a wider range of thermal sensitivities (Brattstrom, 1968; Feder, 1978; Spicer & Gaston, 1999). Thermal acclimation provides a reversible physiological adjustment in response to environmental conditions and offers an energetic advantage over individuals that experience a time lag in physiological response (Angilletta, 2009). Species with restricted geographic distributions and a narrower range of thermal extremes (e.g., mountaintop endemics) may have less opportunity to evolve thermal acclimation and could be considered thermal specialists for their particular temperature range (Bernardo & Spotila, 2006; Brattstrom, 1968; Gifford & Kozak, 2012; Huey & Kingsolver, 1993). As mean absolute range in temperature is found to increase with increasing or decreasing latitude from the equator (M\u00fcller, 1982), a relationship between thermal acclimation ability and latitudinal extent would provide support for the climate variability hypothesis (i.e., a positive relationship should exist between physiological\u2010tolerance breadth and thermal range of the environment) (Stevens, 1989). Further, if acclimation ability is more prevalent among wide\u2010ranging species, it could underlie the large disparity in geographic range size found among closely related, ecologically similar species (Cadena et al., 2012; Calosi, David, Bilton, & Spicer, 2008; Feder, 1978; Prosser, 1975).",

            "text": "Temperature can have a strong influence on physiology and metabolic rate (Bennett & Dawson, 1976; Hochachka & Somero, 1973), and can affect numerous life\u2010history traits including maintenance, growth rate, reproduction, and development (Angilletta, 2009; Angilletta, Niewiarowski, & Navas, 2002; Huey & Stevenson, 1979). To test for an acclimation response to temperature in ectotherms, differences in oxygen consumption (standard metabolic rate, SMR) can be compared for individuals acclimated at lower and higher temperatures (Feder, 1978; Fitzpatrick, 1973; Fitzpatrick & Atebara, 1974). As oxygen uptake is a proxy for ATP demand, changes in SMR can indicate changing energy needs and the health of an individual. After short\u2010term exposure to a warmer temperature, species with acclimation ability should maintain or slightly increase SMR, indicating a positive response shift in physiology (Feder, 1978; Hillman, Withers, Drewes, & Hillyard, 2009). The ability for individuals to reduce or negate the energetic stresses on metabolism, and to remain active at higher temperatures, could lead to the acquisition of greater resources, increased mating opportunities, and expanded distributions (Bernardo, Ossola, Spotila, & Crandall, 2007; Feder, 1976; Hillman et al., 2009). A drop in metabolic rate (i.e., metabolic depression) at higher temperatures could indicate physiological stress, and without acclimation, the survivorship and fitness of individuals could be profoundly reduced during rapid or prolonged changes in temperature (Bernardo & Spotila, 2006).",

Many terrestrial and aquatic organisms have shifted their geographic distributions in response to changes in global temperature (Parmesan, 2006; Root et al., 2003). However, further study of the causal links between environmental temperature, physiology, and range size are necessary (Calosi et al., 2008; Chown, Gaston, & Robinson, 2004; P\u00f6rtner & Knust, 2007). For instance, if narrow\u2010ranging species are found to have less acclimation ability and/or lower tolerance to high temperature, increasing global temperatures could further contract and fragment their already restricted geographic distributions or increase pressure from competitors (Bernardo & Spotila, 2006; Gifford & Kozak, 2012; Jaeger, 1971). This could make them particularly vulnerable to extinction (Harris & Pimm, 2008; Mace et al., 2008). As ectotherms rapidly take on the temperature of their environment (Feder & Lynch, 1982; Hutchison, 1961; Lunghi et al., 2016), physiological plasticity may be especially crucial for survival.",

Salamanders are found to conform quickly to the air temperature of their environment (Lunghi et al., 2016) and present an ideal model system to study associations between temperature, physiological tolerances, and range size. If individuals are rapidly adapting to thermal regimes, we should find a significant relationship between acclimation ability and temperature range of the environment at the population level of species (Bozinovic et al., 2011; Hereford, 2009; Snyder & Weathers, 1975).",

For example, Stillman (2003) found that porcellanid crabs with the greatest thermal limits had the lowest acclimation ability for those traits, and suggested that trade\u2010offs should exist between acclimation capacity and thermal tolerance.

These species vary greatly in geographic range size and their evolutionary relationships are well resolved (Kozak, Mendyk, & Wiens, 2009), enabling results to be analyzed in a phylogenetic context.

Sixteen species of plethodontid salamanders representing four clades were examined: the genus Desmognathus, the Plethodon cinereus group, the Plethodon glutinosus group, and the Plethodon wehrlei group (Table 1). The family Plethodontidae represents a diverse group of lungless salamanders and the phylogenetic relationships among species in this study are strongly supported based on phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial\u2010 and nuclear\u2010DNA sequences (Kozak et al., 2009). Species were chosen to represent a wide variety of range sizes, body sizes, and habitat types. Plethodon salamanders typically inhabit terrestrial habitats, whereas Desmognathus salamanders are more often found in association with seepages and streams (Petranka, 1998). Mature salamanders were collected from throughout the latitudinal extent of each species\u2019 range.",

Consistent with acclimation timelines in other amphibian studies, this time period should ensure full acclimation to these temperatures (see Feder, 1978; Feder, Gibbs, Griffith, & Tsuji, 1984; Hutchison, 1961). Environmental chambers maintained air temperature within 1\u00b0C of the desired acclimation temperature. Acclimation temperatures are representative of fairly typical late spring through early fall evening temperatures that surface\u2010active salamanders within each range would experience (Brattstrom, 1963; Feder & Lynch, 1982), although 22\u00b0C would be at the higher end for some montane endemics. Only sexually mature male and female salamanders were included in the analyses, however, gravid salamanders were not used. Juveniles were not considered as they have been found to have different physiological tolerances from adults in other amphibians (Lunghi, Manenti, & Ficetola, 2015; Spicer & Gaston, 1999). Sample sizes per species ranged from 6 to 44, with larger samples collected from across the range of wide\u2010ranging species and smaller samples from very restricted species.

As diet influences metabolic rate, salamanders were not fed for 7 days prior to the start of the first respirometry trial (Feder et al., 1984; Lagerspetz, 1977). Oxygen consumption measurements were made at one temperature per day, with the order of test temperature assigned randomly to individuals and alternating every week.

As salamanders inhabit underground retreats or spaces beneath rocks and logs during the day, they are well suited to dark, moist respirometer vessels. Test chambers were small enough to limit movement and salamanders are assumed to remain inactive for the most part (Feder et al., 1984).

Critical thermal maximum data were obtained using methods similar to Layne and Claussen (1982), where loss of righting response is considered the endpoint. This point is reached when a salamander is turned onto its back and is unable to right itself within 30 s (Hutchison, 1961). At the start of each trial, individual salamanders were placed into a small container with 2 cm of water and an open top. A 150\u2010watt infrared\u2010heat lamp was placed 27 cm from the surface of the water and increased water temperature by 0.5\u00b0C/min until the end point was reached. An air bubbler was used to circulate the water. Deep body temperatures of salamanders are found to closely follow water temperature at rates of 1.0\u00b0C/min or less (Feder & Lynch, 1982; Hutchison, 1961), therefore, the water temperature at the endpoint of each trial was considered the CTMax result for that individual (as measured by digital thermometer; Fluke 51 II, Everett, WA, USA) (Brattstrom, 1968; Lutterschmidt & Hutchison, 1997). Further, to reduce the affect of diet on thermal physiology, salamanders were not fed for 6 days prior to measurements of CTMax (Hutchison, 1961). Each salamander was weighed before the trial to within 0.001 g.",

If acclimation ability is correlated with environmental thermal variability, then species experiencing broader thermal variation (i.e., wide\u2010ranging species) should have a greater capacity for thermal acclimation (Brattstrom, 1968; Feder, 1978).

For thermal acclimation of metabolism in particular, several species of wide\u2010ranging temperate amphibians have shown some degree of acclimation (Feder, 1978; Fitzpatrick, 1973; Fitzpatrick & Atebara, 1974; Fitzpatrick, Bristol, & Stokes, 1971; Fitzpatrick et al., 1972), whereas two neotropical salamander species were found to have metabolic depression at a higher acclimation temperature (Feder, 1978). Similar to our results, these studies suggest that thermal acclimation is most prevalent among species experiencing higher degrees of environmental temperature variation. While the acclimation tendency of many temperate zone salamanders is to retain a relatively homeostatic metabolic rate at different temperatures, increased SMR may be also advantageous at times where energy expenditure can lead to acquisition of greater resources. (Bernardo et al., 2007; Feder, 1976, 1978; Hillman et al., 2009). For instance, higher SMR can encourage greater vagility and genetic exchange (Bernardo et al., 2007). Acclimation ability could, therefore, have been a distinct advantage for some species in facilitating range expansion (Angilletta, 2009; Hillman et al., 2009), thus supporting predictions of the climate variability hypothesis (Calosi et al., 2008; Stevens, 1989). Even among temperate species, our study demonstrates that there is seemingly enough seasonal variation throughout the landscape to select for species with greater acclimation.",

Physiological specialization to cooler habitats has been hypothesized to constrain the evolution of broad geographic ranges and to limit lowland dispersal (Bernardo & Spotila, 2006; Gilchrist, 1995; Huey & Kingsolver, 1993). Although some species of Plethodon inhabit a wide range of elevations, recent work suggests that the ancestor of this group was restricted to a montane climate (Kozak & Wiens, 2010). Thermal acclimation would have little value in more stable thermal environments, and selection for acclimation ability would be discouraged if it comes at a cost (Feder, 1978). Therefore, the relative stability of higher elevations may limit opportunities for cool\u2010adapted salamanders to expand into warmer habitats (Gifford & Kozak, 2012).",

In fact, there are already indications that some montane salamander species are living in temperatures that reach the limits of their physiological tolerances (Bernardo & Spotila, 2006; Gifford & Kozak, 2012). For species with limited tolerance to warm temperatures, even moderate increases in heat can have large affects on physiological systems. High temperatures can impair enzymatic function and disrupt membrane structure, causing decreased locomotion ability, digestive inefficiencies, and reduced growth (Angilletta, 2009; Hillman et al., 2009). For lungless salamanders, cutaneous respiration on its own may not provide sufficient oxygen at warmer temperatures (Whitford, 1973; Whitford & Hutchison, 1965). Ultimately, warming\u2010induced stress can lower the fitness and survival of individuals. The inability of species to disperse across warm, dry valleys may further increase the risk of extinction for narrow\u2010ranging montane species. Not only is the suitable habitat of their current geographic ranges likely to contract with global temperature rise, but impeded dispersal can lead to genetic erosion and population decline (Bernardo & Spotila, 2006; Calosi et al., 2008; Gifford & Kozak, 2012; Parmesan, 2006). Reductions in surface activity may offer some reprieve from temperature extremes, but salamanders may be especially sensitive to rapid or prolonged changes in their environment (Huey & Stevenson, 1979). Further, with climate change the geographic ranges of competitors and predators may extend further upslope into the ranges of montane species, adding pressure to species already under stress (Bernardo & Spotila, 2006; Gifford & Kozak, 2012). How a species will ultimately fare when faced with global temperature rise will depend on the plasticity and strength of their thermal tolerances, their ability to adapt, and their accessibility to alternative suitable habitat (Davis & Shaw, 2001; Kozak & Wiens, 2010).",

While we find evidence for this when data are combined for all species, within species, there are few clear relationships between acclimation ability and thermal regimes. The only species to demonstrate a significant relationship between acclimation capacity and thermal range is D. ochrophaeus. While we did not sample the entire latitudinal extent of these species, we still fail to see a clear pattern in wide\u2010ranging species such as P. cinereus where 10 populations were tested and thermal range varies by over 7\u00b0C between populations. As salamanders have very small home ranges and low dispersal rates (Petranka, 1998; Wells, 2007), there is good potential for rapid local adaptation. However, studies of amphibians and other taxa (Brattstrom, 1968; Hoffmann & Watson, 1993) have also found little within species variation in thermal tolerances. The lack of among\u2010population variation could potentially be the result of the dynamic climatic history in North America, offering opportunities for both range expansions and contractions (Parmesan et al., 2005; Pielou, 1991). The New World temperate zone is the center of origin for plethodontids, with the clade more recently colonizing and radiating in the New World tropics (Wake & Lynch, 1976; reviewed in Kozak, 2017). Plethodontid lineages that radiated rapidly into different thermal regimes could have done so by gaining adaptive physiological ability over other close relatives with similar ecologies. Therefore, rapid expansion of leading\u2010edge populations with broad tolerances may help to explain the lack of among\u2010population variation within wide\u2010ranging species (Sage & Wolff, 1986; Zink & Dittmann, 1993).",

For instance, other habitat requirements (e.g., precipitation), and biotic factors including competition could also limit species\u2019 ranges and thereby contribute to variation in range size. However, for salamanders, precipitation alone was not found to be a significant predictor of distributions in other studies looking at salamanders (see Quintero & Wiens, 2013\n), and interspecific interactions have only been found to limit portions of distributions (Deitloff, Church, Adams, & Jaeger, 2009; Gifford & Kozak, 2012; Jaeger, 1971). As many of the species in this study are found to coexist regionally and locally (Adams, 2007; Highton, 2004), it suggests that biotic interactions do not underlie variation in geographic range size in the clades we examined. While temperature and physiology alone are not likely to explain all of the aspects of a species\u2019 range, there is empirical support for the strong influence of these factors in determining geographic distributions (Addo\u2010Bediako et al., 2000; Calosi et al., 2010; Gaston, 2003; Hillman et al., 2009).

However, similar to the results of Calosi et al.

This relationship suggests that both traits are potentially good predictors of how a salamander species may respond to climatic change and further highlights the vulnerability of narrow\u2010ranging salamanders to global temperature increase (Calosi et al., 2008). Not only do these species have lower tolerances to high temperatures, but they also have a lesser ability to acclimate to a warming climate.",

Thermal acclimation may enable a species to occupy more seasonal habitats, and is thought to be an important factor determining life histories and distributions of species (Angilletta, 2009; Feder, 1978). Some even argue that acclimation ability may be more important than thermal tolerances in determining vulnerability to climate change (Stillman, 2003). Here, we find a significant difference in acclimation ability between wide and narrow\u2010ranging temperate salamanders. Wide\u2010ranging species maintain or increase metabolic rate when acclimated at a higher temperature, whereas many narrow\u2010ranging species show significant metabolic depression at higher test and acclimation temperatures. In addition, we find a significant relationship between acclimation ability and environmental thermal range at the species\u2010level, but little evidence at the population level within species. These strong species\u2010level results support predictions of the climate variability hypothesis and indicate that acclimation ability could have played a major role in the latitudinal range expansion of wide\u2010ranging salamander species. Finally, as narrow\u2010ranging salamander species are found to have lower tolerance to high temperature, low acclimation ability, restricted distributions, and little access to alternative habitats, they are likely at higher risk of extinction in association with anthropogenic climate warming.",
