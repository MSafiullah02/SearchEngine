Solubility: dissolved in boiling ethanol, slightly soluble in methanol or ethanol, very slightly soluble in chloroform, and almost insoluble in water. Since andrographolide has an ester structure, it is easy to hydrolysis, open loop and isomerization in the aqueous solution to affect the drug stability. At lower temperature, the stability of andrographolide is better; it is unstable in alkaline conditions, and its instability increased with the increase in alkaline strength. The most stable pH value is 3\u20135. Andrographolide is more stable in chloroform.",
