Nowadays, HPV-16 and -18 accounts for approximately 76.7% of cervical cancer worldwide1. Due to issues associated with HPV biology and its pathogenesis, progress in developing effective therapies against infection of these viruses has been slow2. Numerous therapies are accessible for the management of HPV-related diseases, including surgery, cryotherapy and trichloroacetic acid. Although these strategies are effective, but cannot necessarily eradicate HPV infection as they are applicable for removing only the visible lesions3. Since the diagnosis of HPV happens at the late stages of this disease, as little as 7.7% of women demonstrate this infection without any clinical lesion4.",

Future strategies to combat HPV may rely on therapeutic vaccines, oncolytic virotherapy, immunotherapies as well as antivirals, natural derivatives/herbs, and therapies based on RNA interference, which are being thoroughly utilized and can interfere with several stages of the viral life cycle. Several of these therapeutic agents are in advanced stages of clinical assessment5. HPV vaccine is considered as an encouraging approach to hinder HPV related infection. Although the immunologic effect is not always sufficient to prevent of cancer progression, vaccines are commonly well tolerated and offer valuable anticancer effects in some situations.

Many clinical trials have been conducted in this field. In this method the internal production of antigen let the antigen to be presented to the immune system by means of MHC I antigen-processing machinery while still allowing the MHC-II molecules to act. The production of intracellular antigens via exogenous gene more closely mimics live infections, so they can develop the coordinated triggering of both potent cell-mediated and antibody protective immune responses.

Archaeal lipids are composed of typically fully saturated and branched phytanyl chains in many species which are being linked through ether linkage to the glycerol backbone at the positions of the sn-2, 3. The unique structures of archaeal lipids confer considerable stability on archaeosomes. These remarkable molecular and physicochemical characteristics of archaeal lipids confers some superiority over the custom ester phospholipid liposomes which led to the adaptation of their membrane lipid compositions to stringent environments, suitable for the highly stable archaeosomes preparation14. Archaeosomes are demonstrated extremely effectual as a self-adjuvanting vaccine strongly eliciting antigen-specific, both cell-mediated immune and humoral responses, to encapsulated antigens. Some superior characters of Archaeosomes compared with conventional liposomes and other adjuvants are the stimulation and recruitment of dendritic cells; antigen orientation to process via MHC class I which leads to the potent activation of CD8 + cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses that is pivotal to combat against intracellular pathogens and cancer; and archaeal lipid cores stability which make a profound immune memory easier15,16.",

Viruses play a significant role in many human cancers21. It is now estimated that 20\u201325% of human cancers worldwide have a known viral etiology22. Human papillomavirus plays essential roles in the initiation as well as progression of cervical cancer, and continued expression of their viral transforming activities is required for the maintenance of the transformed phenotype4. Investigating of the association between the high-risk HPV, especially HPV 16 (60\u201350%), and the development of cervical cancer, initiates a wide range of studies aimed at producing therapeutic or prophylactic vaccines against HPV infection6,23. To design a vaccine with a high potential to boost immune responses, considering of several parameters such as the dose, time, and routes of administration are essential. Also an appropriate adjuvant in vaccine formulation to increase the stimulation of the immune system are necessary. Although the infection by high-risk papillomavirus can be prevented with introducing of Gardasil and Cervarix vaccines, but the problem remained still due to the general non- vaccination of communities and the presence of non-responder infected populations24. It seems that there is no ideal vaccine with a high efficacy in clinical phases, which can act as a therapeutic and preventive. Therefore, designing these types of vaccine was the aim of the present study.",

In addition, the induced immune response is long-term26. The cellular immune response in contrast to humoral immunity plays an important role in effectively responding against human papillomavirus. It is believed that the human papillomavirus vaccine should not only prevent the formation of primary infections, but also provide treatment approach. Antibody\u2010mediated immunity is only able to prevent infection, while cell-mediated immunity against the intracellular proteins of the papillomavirus can perform both functions by activating T helper cells for the proliferation and differentiation of B cells and CD8+ (cytotoxic) T cells and the production of inhibitory cytokines27.",

Early studies have demonstrated that archaeosomes can induce a long-term antibody response in their associated antigen only after two initial injections on Days 0 and 2133. In the initial stage after immunization by bovine serum albumin-archaeosomes, more than 95% of CD8 + T cells responded to the antigen15. The study by Patel et al. revealed that the archaeosomes made of lipids extracted from M. smithii are an appropriate adjuvant for a multivalent mucosal vaccine. The archaeosome containing encapsulated antigen OVA and egg lysozyme demonstrated a robust and specific antibody response to all antigens16. Krishnan et al. (2010) reported that archaeosomes made of lipids extracted from M. smithii are a strong adjuvants for evoking a CD8 + T cell response. Their results exhibited that system could be used in the formulation of cancer vaccines13. Rethore et al. (2009) examined the archaeosome made of synthetic tetraether lipids as a new gene delivery system, and the results showed that these archaeosomes could be used for the delivery of genes in vitro35.

The presence of cholesterol is required in stabilizing the dual-layer membrane and increasing the liposomes\u2019 persistence in the in vivo environment. In the absence of cholesterol, liposomes are destabilize by HDL and followed by the release of the contents, and the drug is rapidly removed from blood circulation38. In the endocytosis process for entering the cells, liposome is swallowed by cells, like the phagocytosis of foreign particles by phagocytes. It has been shown that, by decreasing the size of liposomes, their surface potential is reduced. Also, increasing the particle size of liposomes to more than 1000 nm leads to rapid swallowing by macrophages and, consequently, early removal from blood circulation39. Macrophage cells which have different endocytic activities swallow almost all types of liposomes. According to studies by Allen et al., elimination of liposomes with a very small size (about 8\u20134 nm) does not occur, and these particles are only partially removed by glomerular filtration in the kidneys. However, due to their inherent instability, vesicles with a particle size of less than 40\u201350 nm are not constructed38.",

Thus, in this research, the cytokine secretion of the splenocytes of the vaccinated mice in test groups was compared with negative control groups. One of the first problems in the use of Alum as an adjuvant has been its inability to induce strong IgG2a and cell-mediated immunity, in particular, Th1 cells. Archaeosome strongly induces both IgG1 and IgG2a34. In addition, the antigen-specific activation of both Th1 and Th2 cells was corroborated by splenocytes from archaeosome-antigen immunized mice relative to the antigen Alum group42. Archaeosome-antigen presentation occurs through the classical cytosolic pathway and MHC class I molecules, in which a strong adjuvant activity is sufficiently potent to bypass a requirement for CD4 + T cell help.

Archaeosomes have been introduced as highly valuable carrier for vaccines which, besides appropriate presentation of antigen to immunocompetent cells and improving antigen stability, they have the ability to overcome biological obstacles, such as skin and mucosa. Moreover, they provide controlled and slow release of antigens. In addition to the ability to induce a potent immune response by adjuvant property, archaeosome-based vaccines have features that are essential for the improvement of modern vaccine formulations.
