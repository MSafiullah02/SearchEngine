The advice guideline has been updated to the seventh version [2] based on clinical evidence, experience and the requirement of epidemic prevention. Certainly, clinical practice has proved the effectiveness of these guidelines, and the incidence of COVID-19 has significantly reduced in most of the areas in China. While, as reported by media, the situation outside of China, especially in Italy, Iran, Spain, Republic of Korea, France, German, United States of America and other countries seem to be changed. By 18 March 2020, the total incidence of COVID-19 is estimated by more than 191,000 cases [3]. Respiratory droplets and close contact are still the main routes of transmission [1, 4].",

For the diagnosis, nucleic acid detection as stated in the guideline is still served as a \u201cgold standard\u201d, and most time well-collected throat swab specimen is enough for diagnosis. While, it was reported that the false negative rate was sometimes to be relatively high to as 50% in a single detection [5], mainly because that the specimen from the upper other than the lower respiratory tract usually contained less amount of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), especially for mild type and recessive patients [6]. Hence, multiple sites and time points of tests are required, and even bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) is required for \u201chighly suspected patients\u201d. Besides, test for newly developed specific serum antibody can provide more accurate results, and IgM antibody which appeared to be positive within 3 to 5 days after onset in 3 to 5 days and IgG antibody increased over 4 times than that in the acute phase [2]. With the above positive finding, the patients can be defined as \u201cconfirmed cases\u201d.",

            "text": "Secondly, stratification and identification of potentially infected patients are also very important in the clinic, thereby further management should be performed by individualization. For the diagnosis of \u201csuspected patients\u201d, \u201cclose contact\u201d and \u201csuspicious exposure\u201d, the guideline and multidisciplinary experts focused any of epidemiological risk such as \u201ca history of travel to or residence in Wuhan city, China or other cities with continuous transmission of local cases in the last 14 days before symptom onset; contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan city, China or other cities with continuous transmission of local cases in the last 14 days before symptom onset; or epidemiologically connected to COVID-19 infections or clustered onsets\u201d [1, 2]. However, in the clinical practice, from the first onset case to now, the epidemiological risk evaluation seems to be harder and harder for the doctors, as more and more patients in the out-patient department and emergency department cannot clearly state their contact with other potential infections. Additionally, attention need to be focused on such patients. After collecting the data of patients from our hospital and combining with our clinical experience [8], we proposed a simple stratification process for COVID-19 based on all 4 items: epidemiological risk assessment, clinical symptom assessment, blood routine assessment and chest CT assessment; As shown in Fig. 1. The former 2 items can complete by consultation, and the later 2 items can be easily conducted in most hospitals. Specifically, CT imaging is always the important reference for clinical diagnosis [1, 7], meanwhile more and more clinical studies demonstrate the value of blood routine parameters for differential diagnosis for COVID-19 [8, 9]. As strongly recommended in this guideline [1], typical CT imaging can be used for the stage diagnosis, and with nucleic acid detection as a reference, the sensitivity and specificity of chest CT imaging were calculated to be 97 and 25%, respectively [5]. Besides, blood routine parameters actually can provide important information, for the differential diagnosis from other community acquired pneumonia [8, 9], as well as for the severity of disease since the blood routine parameters are significantly different between no-severe and severe type of COVID-19 patients as reported in the large scale study by Zhong Nan-Shan et al [4]. Also, with nucleic acid detection as a reference, when blood routine test parameters were presented as normal, reduced or increased with normal limits, the sensitivity and specificity were calculated to be 89 and 34%, respectively [9], and multiple parameters analysis in blood routine were helpful to further increase the specificity [8]. Meanwhile, when they were presented as optimal cut-off value, the specificity was calculated to be significantly increased to nearly 80% [8]. Taking together all the above reported data, a combination of blood routine test and CT imaging would significantly increase the primary screening efficacy. Combined with our experience and current diagnostic process in this guideline, we proposed a scoring proposal including additionally specific parameters in the blood routine test and typical manifestations in the CT imaging to increase the clinical feasibility. After application in the clinic, it was simple and rapid for primary screening, and was easy to follow for both doctors and nurses. Our study aiming at the accurate data on its primary screening efficacy is still ongoing.\n",
