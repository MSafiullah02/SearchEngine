The review discusses the well known RNases that possess established antiviral effects, including both intracellular RNases (RNase L, MCPIP1 protein, and eosinophil associated RNases) and exogenous RNases (RNase A, BS RNase, onconase, binase, and synthetic RNases). Attention is paid to two important, but not always obligatory, aspects of molecules of RNases that have antiviral properties, i.e., catalytic activity and ability to dimerize. The hypothetic scheme of virus elimination by exogenous RNases that reflects possible types of interaction of viruses and RNases with a cell is proposed. The evidence for RNases as classical components of immune defense and thus perspective agents for the development of new antiviral therapeutics is proposed.",

The control of blood vessel growth, toxicity against tumor cells, and antiviral activity are all properties of RNases that may potentially be utilized in medicine and define the cur rent hot points in studies focused on these enzymes. In the review, we consider the best known RNase that possesses antiviral effects. Molecular structures of these RNases are presented in Fig. 1 ; obviously, they are not characterized by a significant homology. Therefore, the structural similarity of the catalytically active proteins is not a determining feature for their antiviral effects.",

In particular, transgenic tobacco plants with increased activity of intracellular Zinnia elegans ribonuclease ZRNaseII possessed high stability against the tobacco mosaic virus [4] . Bacterial endoribonucleases specific to certain nucleotide sequences, e.g., the RNase ToxN, provide for the phage stability of the population, inducing death of cells due to cleavage of phage and cel lular RNA [5] .

The key enzyme of the system is 2',5' oli goadenylate synthetase polymerizing ATP with for mation of RNase L activator, 2',5' oligoadenylate, of the general formula ppp2',5' A n , where n = 2-10 ade nylate residues. RNase L mechanism of action is well studied, i.e., the active form of RNase L forms a dimer with endoribonuleolytic activity against both viral and cellular RNA [7, 8] . Products of RNA cleavage less than 200 nucleotide long are recognized by protein factors RIG I and MDA5. Therefore, the formation of RNA fragments enhanced by RNase L, followed by their interaction with RIG I and MDA5, activates transcription factor NF \u03baB and triggers transcription of interferon \u03b2 gene, which prevents virus replication and stimulates the growth of immune system cells [9] . However, the system may not completely protect cells from virus. In enteroviruses of group C, a phylogenet ically conserved RNA structure resistant to cleavage by RNase L and inhibiting the activity of its endoribo nuclease domain has been found inside an open read ing frame [10] . A neurotropic Theiler's picornavirus inducing chronic infection of central nervous system and demyelination of nervous tissue produces a spe cies specific helper protein L* that inhibits RNase L through interaction with its ankyrin domain [11] . These viruses possess mechanisms that provide for their resistance to RNase L, because they may block either its activity or ability for dimer formation. Inter estingly, dimerization contributes to the antiviral activity of RNases L, along with the catalytic activity, which is required for viral RNA cleavage a priori.",

At the level of amino acid sequences, they possess certain homology with bovine pancreatic ribonuclease and belong to a large super family of RNase A, the members of which have disul fide bonds in their structures. ECP, or RNase 3, is the most cationic (pI = 11) and the least catalytically active protein of the family, and EDN (RNase 2, pI = 9) possesses approximately 100 fold higher activity [17] . Only EDN that possesses a unique loop of nine amino acid residues (L7) that differs different from a similar loop in ECP at its C terminus exhibits high activity against the respiratory syncytial virus associated with the contribution of this structure to interaction of RNase with viral capsid and penetration inside the vir ion [18] . Rosenberg [19] , who studies eosinophil associated RNases, supposes that respiratory viruses containing ssRNA are evolutionarily established mobile targets for EDN, which directly utilizes its ribonucleolytic activity for the antiviral effect.

An RNase from the R. catesbei ana frog, homologous to onconase, efficiently blocks the replication of an RNA containing virus of Japa nese encephalitis and stimulates activation of caspases 3, 8, and 9, inducing apoptosis of infected BHK 21 cells [24] . Modern studies demonstrated that both onconase and RNase A are inefficient with respect to the respiratory syncytial virus [28] . At the same time, onconase and rAmphinase 2 (a recombinant protein similar to onconase) inhibited the replication of DNA containing viruses, such as herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, Epstein-Barr virus, Kaposi sarcoma associated herpes virus, cytomegalovirus, and roseolovirus, without causing infected cell death; the two latter virus types were the most sensitive to these RNases [25] . Therefore, the antiviral effect, even of closely related amphibian RNases, does not cover all viruses; certain RNases are active against certain viruses. This is due to the specific features of the struc ture of various viruses, the versatility of the organiza tion, and the properties of the cell they target, as well as the variability of molecular structures and the level of RNase catalytic activity.",

            "text": "Bovin pancreatic RNase does not possess consider able activity against HIV 1, while bovine seminal RNase (BS RNase) inhibited the replication of the virus in H9 leukemia cells [33] . It was demonstrated that cleavage of dsRNA by BS RNase is enhanced in the presence of interferon \u03b3, which probably contrib utes to the mechanisms of antiviral immune defense [34] . Let us note that BS RNase is a natural dimer, monomers of which are linked by two intramolecular disulfide bonds. This structure imparts the molecule stability against cytosolic RNase inhibitor and decreases its toxic effects compared to the monomer [33] . It should also be noted that many RNases tend to form oligomeric structures, including RNase A lyo philized from a solution in 40% acetic acid forms dimers, trimers, tetramers, and higher order multim ers [36] . Dimers are formed via the exchange of the terminal domains between the monomers (either C or N terminal dimers). An important factor that pro motes oligomerization is the hydrophobic nature of the C terminal part of the molecule and hydrophilic nature of the N terminal part [37] . In all studied crys tal structures of a microbial RNase binase, there are features that indicate dimer formation, in which active center of one of the subunits is closed due to interac tions between the subunits [38] . \u03b1 Helices of the mol ecules of BS Rnase, RNase A, human pancreatic RNase H, and binase contain hydrophobic segments capable of participating in both the interaction with the lipid bilayer and dimerization [39] . Among the RNases discussed thus far, only the BS RNase is an established natural dimer. However, the data on the need for dimer formation by the monomers of RNase L and MCPIP1 [7, 8, 15, 16] for them to acquire the ability to destroy the viral genetic material evidence that the contribution of supramolecular organization of RNases to their antiviral activity has not yet been sufficiently studied.",

Both native and dextran modified microbial RNase caused greater and more prolonged effect on a DNA contain ing Aujeszky's disease virus than RNase A [40] . Binase, or RNase of Bacillus intermedius (modern title B. pumilus [41] ), well studied by now, exhibited high activity against the RNA containing street rabies virus in infected Guinea pigs, rabbits, and mice when injected to the site of infection [42, 43] . Therapeutic effect of binase was registered both 2-3 h after infec tion and 1 day later (57-67% animal protection); the enzyme did not affect the formation of vaccine immu nity. A single intraperitoneal injection of binase to rab bits infected with foot and mouth disease virus type O and type A22 550 decreased animal mortality by threefold [44] . Binase also possesses activity against influenza A/Bethesda/10/63, A/Odessa/2882/82, and B/Leningrad/369/76 viruses comparable to that of a classic antiviral agent, rimantadine. Binase was found to be active against influenza virus types A and B, while rimantadine is not active against influenza virus type B [45] . Recently, we demonstrated that, at the non toxic concentrations to epithelial cells, binase exhibited antiviral activity against the pandemic influ enza A/Hamburg/04/09 (H1N1) virus, the causal agent of the epidemic in 2009, upon both single and multicycle virus reproduction. The short term treat ment of virus infectious particles (15-30 min) with binase at increasing concentrations proportionally decreased the viability of the virus, which manifested by weakening its ability to infect lung adenocarcinoma cells A549 by almost an order of magnitude (Fig. 2 ) [46] . Importantly, binase does not induce expression of specific marker of immune response antigen CD69 and synthesis of interferon \u03b3 in population of CD8+ and CD4+ T lymphocytes, which evinces that the enzyme lacks the ability to induce polyclonal T cell response of the superantigen type [47] .",

Chemical conjugates of lysine moieties with imidazole model the active center of RNase, contain the RNA binding and RNA hydrolyzing domains, and may find application for inactivation of RNA in gene targeting therapy [52] . Mimetics of RNases of another class have been created based on the conjugates of diazabi cyclo [2.2.2] octane with imidazole; the rate of RNA hydrolysis by these mimetics increases proportionally to the number of positive charges in the molecule [53] . Recently, synthetic RNases were found to act not only on RNA containing viruses through hydrolysis of viral RNA [54] , but also on DNA containing viruses, in particular cowpox virus, through the destruction of the virus envelope [55] .",

            "text": "OF ANTIVIRAL RNases Modern antiviral agents should be used with due regard to the data on mechanisms of action and the targets whose damage leads to virus elimination. The most general effect is produced by preparations con taining interferon as a stimulator of the cell's natural defense system against the virus or synthetic analogues of nucleosides that block the synthesis of viral nucleic acids. The effect of other agents is selectively targeted against various stages of viral infection development and the life cycle of the virus, i.e., adsorption, penetra tion, synthesis of virus components, and the exit of daughter virions form cell. Agents that act upon virus genome are of particular interest; they include anti sense oligonucleotides [56] , ribozymes [57] , and RNases discussed here. These agents suppress virus production, but they are probably able to destroy latent virus infection. Here, we consider three possible mechanisms of the effect of binase on RNA contain ing viruses, which may be exerted at any stage of cell infection. At the first stage, when binase meets the virus outside cell, its catalytic activity is not inhibited by the natural RNase and it may destroy viral RNA (Fig. 3, C) . Mechanism of binase penetration inside the virion is not clear, however it has been proven that virus infecting ability decreases upon direct treatment of virus particles with binase [46] . At the next stage, binase may interact with the virus inside an endosome since endosomal type of internalization is characteris tic for exogenous RNases, e.g. \u03b1 sarcine [58] , RNase A [59] , BS RNase [60] , and binase [61] (Fig. 1) . Finally, penetration of binase into cell nucleus is of particular importance: here the enzyme may directly destroy viral RNA (Fig. 3, A and B) . Today, localization of exogenous RNases in cell nucleus has been convinc ingly demonstrated only for BS RNase [60] and binase [61] . It should be noted that binase penetrated not all cells: for example, the enzyme did not enter the alveolar epithelium MLE 12 cells expressing viral T antigen on their surface, but rather caused their death [62] . Since a number of facts that indicate the interaction of RNases with cell surface structures has been accumulated [63] , the contribution of these structures to the internalization of RNases by infected cells should be taken into account. Therefore, for the development of highly efficient antiviral preparations based on RNases, knowledge of the exact stage at which the enzyme affects the virus is obligatory.",

            "text": "Furthermore, careful attention is focused on the possibility of the intervention of exogenous RNases in the process of RNA interference involved in protec tion against viruses [64, 65] . The leading role is played by the Dicer RNase producing small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and using dsRNAs (an intermediate product of virus replication) as a substrate [64] . Furthermore, it has been found that siRNAs specific to a conserved region of influenza virus RNA introduced into a cell decreased the titer of the virus [65] . Antiviral potential of siRNAs is increased upon application in a complex with polycationic carrier [65, 67] . The application of siRNAs in antiviral therapy is not limited to the treat ment of the influenza virus. Positive results have been obtained in experiments on laboratory mice infected with a coronavirus causing severe respiratory syn drome and syncytial virus [64] . So far, there are few explicit data on the participation of exogenous RNases in formation and destruction of siRNAs. It was dem onstrated that onconase changes the siRNA expres sion profile in several pleura mesothelioma cell lines through the destruction of precursors of these mole cules and thus decreasing the amount of substrate for the Dicer RNase [68] . Therefore, the mechanisms of the antiviral activity of RNases include both the direct effect on the nucleocapsid and nucleic acid and indi rect effects, i.e., intervention into the RNA interfer ence, immunomodulation, and induction of apoptosis in infected cells. Figure 3 demonstrates hypothetical models of the elimination of viral infection by an exogenous RNase in function of the type of interac tion with cell: independent penetration (A), joint internalization (B), or outside cell (C).",
