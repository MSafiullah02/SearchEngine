Therefore, the treatment of metabolic acidosis is the administration of intravenous bicarbonate solutions or a precursor: lactate, citrate, or acetate. 2. If the pH is greater than 7.45 (recall that normal pH is 7.35-7.45) then the patient has alkalemia: (a) Look at the PaCO 2 as before. If it is less than 40 mm Hg, then the patient has respiratory alkalosis. Respiratory alkalosis is caused by decreased levels of dissolved CO 2 in the blood, due to either hyperventilation of CO 2 out of the lungs or decreased production of CO 2 in the body. There are several possible underlying causes: central or CNS-induced hyperventilation, which is increased minute ventilation (increased respiratory rate and/or increased tidal volume), usually from anxiety or a CNS lesion; the respiratory stimulus of altitude; pregnancy; or too much mechanical ventilation. Alternately, underproduction of CO 2 may be from hypothermia or muscle relaxation from nondepolarizing muscle relaxant drugs. One can correct respiratory alkalosis by adjusting ventilation or treating anxiety with sedatives. (b) If the PaCO 2 is normal or slightly increased, then the patient has a metabolic alkalosis. This is caused by one of several causes: vomiting or loss of protons in gastric secretions owing to nasogastric or orogastric suction (classically, in the face of gastric outlet obstruction); diuretic use (classically after heavy furosemide diuresis in the postoperative period -especially after cardiac surgery); antacid use; or hyperaldosteronism. Metabolic alkalosis needs to be corrected because the condition predisposes to dysrhythmias, cerebral vasoconstriction, and coronary vasoconstriction. Also, in mechanically ventilated patients, the condition leads to a vexing secondary effect: the retention of CO 2 in the blood, which makes weaning from mechanical ventilation more troublesome in some patients. One corrects metabolic alkalosis by simply infusing normal saline, potassium chloride, or both, intravenously, or, in severe cases, dilute hydrochloric acid is carefully infused centrally. Acetazolamide may also be used if the patient can't tolerate the increased volume load of intravenous solutions.",

In cases of coagulopathy, it is done to replace coagulation factors and thereby, restore hemostasis. In autoimmune or dilutional thrombocytopenia, transfusion of platelets may at least partly correct these conditions and allow thrombosis to occur normally. In cases of platelet inactivity due to disease or medications (e.g., NSAIDs), a small amount of platelets (one unit rather than 6 pooled units) can serve as a catalyst and initiate platelet thrombus formation and achieve the first steps of hemostasis. Finally, long after surgery, or in protracted illnesses or recuperation, it is often necessary to give RBC when a critical anemic threshold is met.",

Blood is aspirated from the surgical field into a reservoir where it is periodically washed and filtered to yield a high hematrocrit blood product from the patient's own blood. It is controversial in cases of malignancy, because theoretically tumor cells can be aspirated and reinfused intravenously. Recently, however, leukocyte depletion filters (which do not allow cells much larger than RBC's to remain in the product to be infused) have been shown to efficiently remove all tumor cells from the aspirated blood.

If given in enough quantity (8-10 units of blood), citrate may cause transient hypocalcemia manifested as vasodilatation and hypotension.

Physicians have a legal duty to give blood when indicated (and permitted by the patient) to prevent organ damage from hypotension, tissue hypoxia, and acidosis. A competent patient, however, also has the absolute right to refuse transfusion or any therapy. Informed consent applies to blood transfusion and some institutions have a dedicated form for obtaining it.Religious or philosophical issues: Jehovah's Witnesses and others are doctrinally opposed to transfusion of blood products and should be queried regarding their wishes during anesthesia and postoperative care. Remember that besides PRBCs many other products (albumin, Plasmanate \u00ae , platelets, cryoprecipitate, as well as factor IX concentrates) are derived from human blood. However, patients' specific beliefs about these products vary, and a detailed conversation and written documentation of a patient's wishes will avoid confusion.Professional issues: It is wise to include other physicians and caretakers in discussions about transfusion prior to initiation. It is also a good practice to use evidence based professional guidelines for transfusion therapy (see Tables 14.11 (Table 14 .10 clarifies these) and give informed consent. Transfusion and the use of coagulation factors is fraught with complications and therefore it is wise to achieve consensus among the caretakers, patient, and family before transfusing. The standard guideline thresholds and dosages for transfusion of various blood products are listed in Table 14 .11.Economic issues: Transfusion is very expensive (compared with infusing crystalloid or colloid) as are the recombinant-derived blood proteins. Usually it's wise to confer with others about cost-effectiveness before prescribing.",
