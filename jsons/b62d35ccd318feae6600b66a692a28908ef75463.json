Various 200 ps molecular dynamics simulations were subsequently performed to investigate the dynamics behaviors of several structural features. Both M pro ST and M pro SH exhibit similar folds as their respective template proteins. These structural models reveal three distinct functional domains as well as an intervening loop connecting domains II and III as found in both template proteins. In addition, domain III of these structures exhibits the least secondary structural conservation. A catalytic cleft containing the substrate binding subsites S1 and the S2 between domains I and II are also observed in these structural models. Although these structures share many common features, the most significant difference occurs at the S2 subsite, where the amino acid residues lining up this subsite are least conserved. It may be a critical challenge for designing anti-SARS drugs by simply screening the known database of proteinase inhibitors.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "An outbreak of atypical pneumonia, designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), was first reported in Guangdong Province of China in late 2002, and rapidly spread to several countries. 1,2 Infection by SARS is usually characterized by high fever, malaise, rigor, headache, nonproductive cough and may progress to generalized, interstitial infiltrates in the lung. 3 Attempts to identify the etiology of the SARS outbreak were not successful until March 2003, when laboratories in the United States, Canada, Germany, and Hong Kong isolated a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) from SARS patients. The sequence of the complete genome of SARS-CoV was further determined and characterized with two different isolates. 4, 5 Phylogenetic analyses and sequence comparisons reveal that SARS-CoV is not closely related to any of the three groups of coronaviruses, including two human coronaviruses, HcoV-229E (group I) and HcoV-OC43 (group II), which are responsible for about 30% of mild upper respiratory tract illnesses, [6] [7] [8] in particular, the common cold. 9 Coronaviruses belong to a diverse group of positivestranded RNA viruses featuring the largest viral RNA genomes known to date (27-31 kb) . They share a similar genome organization and common transcriptional and translational processes as Arteriviridae. 10, 11 The human coronavirus HcoV-229E replicase gene encodes two overlapping polyproteins, pp1a (replicase 1a,~450 kDa) and pp1ab (replicase 1ab, 750 kDa), 12 that mediate all the functions required for viral replication and transcription. 13 The functional polypeptides are released from the polyproteins by extensive proteolytic processing, which is primarily achieved by the 33.1-kDa HCoV-229E main proteinase (M pro ). 14 M pro is commonly also called 3C-like proteinase (3CL pro ) to indicate a similarity of its cleavage site specificity to that observed for picornavirus 3C proteinase (3C pro ) and the identification of a Cys residue as the principle nucleophile in the context of a predicted two-b-barrel fold. 15, 16 M pro from HcoV-229E (M pro H) has been biosynthesized in Escherichia coli and the enzyme properties, inhibitor profile, and substrate specificity of the purified protein have been well characterized. 14, 17 Several studies have revealed significant differences in both the active sites and domain structures of M pro from coronavirus and picornavirus. [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] It is noteworthy that coronavirus M pro possesses a large C-terminal domain of~110 amino acid residues (domain III) that is not found in other RNA virus 3CL pro . Deletion of this domain results in dramatic losses of proteolytic activity, suggesting that the C-terminal domain III of M pro contributes to proteolytic activity through undefined mechanisms. Previous experimental data have shown that the differential cleavage kinetics of sites within pp1a/pp1ab are a conserved feature of coronavirus M pro and that similar processing kinetics for the replicase polyproteins of all coronaviruses can be predicted. 22 Furthermore, the cleavage pattern appears to be conserved in M pro from SARS-CoV (M pro S) and from other coronaviruses, 23 as deduced from the genome sequence. 5, 24 The functional importance of M pro in the viral life cycle has made this proteinase an attractive target for the development of drugs directed against SARS and other coronavirus infections. Moreover, molecular modeling has suggested that available rhinovirus 3C pro inhibitors such as compound AG7088 may be modified to be tested for SARS therapy. 23 Therefore, screening the known proteinase inhibitor libraries may be an appreciated shortcut to discover anti-SARS drugs. 25 Recently, crystal structures of M pro H 23 and M pro from porcine coronavirus (transmissible gastroenteritis virus, TGEV) (M pro T) complexed with its inhibitor 26 have been determined. In addition, homology models of M pro S based on the crystal structures of M pro H 23 and M pro T 25 have been also reported. Comparison of these structures reveals a remarkable degree of conservation of the substrate binding sites, which is further supported by the cleavage of the substrate for the M pro T with the recombinant M pro S. 23 In addition, M pro S shows 40 and 44% sequence identity to M pro H and M pro T, respectively. 23 Although the results from the deduced genome sequence of SARS-CoV have indicated that it belongs to a new group of coronaviruses, 24 the significantly high sequence identity of M pro S to bovine coronavirus (BCoV) M pro (49%) and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) M pro (50%) from group II coronaviruses has allowed Anand et al. 23 to recognize it as an outlier among group II coronaviruses.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 375, "end": 376, "text": "3", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 719, "end": 721, "text": "4,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 722, "end": 723, "text": "5", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1020, "end": 1023, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1024, "end": 1027, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1028, "end": 1031, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1064, "end": 1065, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1192, "end": 1202, "text": "(27-31 kb)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1319, "end": 1322, "text": "10,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1323, "end": 1325, "text": "11", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1476, "end": 1478, "text": "12", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1560, "end": 1562, "text": "13", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1743, "end": 1745, "text": "14", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2040, "end": 2043, "text": "15,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2044, "end": 2046, "text": "16", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2248, "end": 2251, "text": "14,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2252, "end": 2254, "text": "17", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2400, "end": 2404, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2405, "end": 2409, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2410, "end": 2414, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2415, "end": 2419, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2420, "end": 2424, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3038, "end": 3040, "text": "22", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3162, "end": 3164, "text": "23", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3202, "end": 3204, "text": "5,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3205, "end": 3207, "text": "24", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3556, "end": 3558, "text": "23", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3681, "end": 3683, "text": "25", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3845, "end": 3847, "text": "26", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4209, "end": 4211, "text": "23", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4306, "end": 4308, "text": "23", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4632, "end": 4634, "text": "23", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in the atomic level have been intensively applied to gain insight into the structure-function relationships of proteins.

The Homology program provides simultaneous optimization of both structure and sequence homologies for multiple proteins in a 3D graphics environment, based on a method developed by Greer. 37 Smith-Waterman pairwise amino acid sequence alignments were performed based on the conserved active site and substrate binding subsites among M pro from various coronaviruses to find the location of the active site and substrate binding subsite of M pro S.

Such conservation can be detected as a pattern of conserved residues that would be unlikely to have occurred by chance. Therefore, an optimal amino acid sequence alignment based on the conserved residues is essential to the success of structural homology. The results of amino acid sequence alignment of M pro S to M pro T and M pro H are given in Fig. 2 . There are 301, 300, and 306 residues in M pro T, M pro H, and M pro S, respectively. The residue corresponding to Ala46 in domain I of M pro S and those corresponding to Asp248, Ile249, and Gln273 in domain III of M pro S are missing in both M pro T and M pro H. In addition, there are one and two extra residues at the C-terminus of M pro S compared to M pro T and M pro H, respectively. There are 33, 33, and 29 totally conserved residues in domains I, II, and III among these M pro , respectively, indicating that domain III exhibits higher sequence variation among these three domains. It has been predicted earlier that the active site of the coronavirus M pro is similar to those of picornavirus 3C pro . 16 Both the general acid-base catalyst and the nucleophile residues of these three proteins are totally conserved, where the general acid-base catalyst His41 is located in a highly conserved signature sequence (LNGLWLXDXVXCPRHVI) of domain I and the nucleophilic Cys144 for M pro T and M pro H or Cys145 for M pro S is located in the highly conserved signature sequence (TIXGSFXXGXCGSXG) of domain II (i.e., Xs indicate the nonconserved residues). Table 1 lists the percentages of amino acid identity among these proteins. M pro T and M pro H show the highest total amino acid identity (60.80%), whereas M pro H and M pro S exhibit the lowest total amino acid identity (40.19%) . In addition, domain II has the highest amino acid identity, whereas domain III shows the lowest amino acid identity among these three proteins. M pro S shows slightly higher amino acid identity to M pro T than M pro H, indicating that the structure of M pro S may be more similar to M pro T than M pro H.

The level of similarity between M pro S and M pro T as well as M pro H allowed us to construct two structural models for M pro S (denoted as M pro ST and M pro SH) by the comparative approach and the results are illustrated in Figs. 1(C) and 1(D). There are three 1-and 2-residue insertions in M pro S, relative to both structural templates (Fig. 2) ; as to be expected, these are all located in loops and do not present a problem in model building. Both M pro ST and M pro SH exhibit three distinct domains, indicating that they adopt similar folds as M pro T and M pro H, respectively. However, the secondary structures of both M pro ST and M pro SH predicted according to DSSP 40 were less conserved compared to those of M pro T ( Fig. 1(A) ) and M pro H ( Fig. 1(B) The putative substrate binding subsites S1 and S2 of M pro ST and M pro SH are located in a cleft between domains I and II, which are nearly identical to those of M pro T and M pro H (Fig. 1) .

Comparing the two crystallographic structures, M pro T and M pro H, and the two homology models, M pro ST and M pro SH, we found that domain I of M pro S is more similar to that of M pro H, while domains II and III of M pro S are more similar to those of M pro T.

The overall structural changes were evaluated by plotting the RMSDs of these proteins relative to the original positions in the corresponding starting structures as a function of running time as shown in Fig. 3 . During the MD time course, these structures remained considerably stable, with the RMSDs remaining within 3 \u00c5. It is obvious that domain III exhibited more structural variations than the other two domains in all cases. The substrate binding subsite S1 of M pro ST was found to maintain its structural integrity during the entire MD time course, whereas the substrate binding subsite S2 of M pro ST exhibited more structural variations. The higher structural variation of S2 makes it flexible enough to accommodate a bulky hydrophobic residue from the substrate.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 355, "end": 363, "text": "(Fig. 2)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 490, "end": 498, "text": "(Fig. 2)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 545, "end": 563, "text": "(Fig. 1(A) and (B)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1123, "end": 1129, "text": "Fig. 3", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Molecular dynamics simulations"}, {"text": "The secondary structure propensity of these proteins was predicted according to DSSP 40 during the entire MD courses and the results are shown in Fig. 4 . As expected, both M pro T and M pro H exhibited higher secondary structure stabil- ity than M pro ST and M pro SH. The interior of the b-barrel of domain I consists entirely of hydrophobic residues. A short a-helix (Helix AI; Tyr53-Ser58) closes the barrel like a lid. 23, 26 However, this short a-helix in both M pro T and M pro H is unstable during the 200 ps MD simulations (Fig. 4(A) and (B)). Furthermore, this short a-helix is missing in M pro ST and M pro SH (Fig. 4(C) and (D) ). Domain II is smaller than domain I and also smaller than the homologous domain II of shymotrypsin and hepatitis A virus (HAV) 3C pro . [48] [49] [50] Several secondary structure elements of HAV 3C pro are missing in both M pro T and M pro H. Domain III is composed of 5, mostly antiparallel, a-helices and the loops connecting them. Interhelical contacts are mediated by hydrophobic side chains. 26 Database searches 7,51 did not reveal other proteins or protein domains with the same topology as domain III. The present homology models showed that some of the secondary structures of M pro T and M pro H were missing in domain III. It is possible that in order to maintain folds similar to the template proteins, some of the main-chain and side-chain hydrogen bonding patterns of both M pro ST and M pro SH were missing, resulting in the loss of the secondary structure content.

These results indicate that both M pro T and M pro ST may exhibit more stable active site configurations than those of M pro S and M pro SH. It is generally assumed that the native state of the active site of papain-like cystein proteinases is a thiolate-imidazolium ion pair formed by Cys and His residues. 54 In proteinases of the papain family, an Asn residue is the third member of the catalytic triad. Chymotrypsin and other members of this serine proteinase family have a catalytic triad consisting of Ser195-His57-Asp102.

The corresponding segment was also found in M pro S, although its amino acid sequence is not conserved compared to those of M pro T and M pro H (Fig. 2) . A direct involvement of His163 or Asp186 of M pro T, Gln163 or Asp186 of M pro H, and His164 or Asp187 of M pro S in catalysis, makes them a clear case of viral cystein proteinase employing only a catalytic dyad. 26", "cite_spans": [{"start": 123, "end": 125, "text": "16", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 335, "end": 337, "text": "26", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 429, "end": 431, "text": "26", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 810, "end": 812, "text": "54", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1267, "end": 1270, "text": "52,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1271, "end": 1274, "text": "56,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1275, "end": 1277, "text": "57", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1451, "end": 1459, "text": "(Fig. 2)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1798, "end": 1806, "text": "(Fig. 2)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Active site"}, {"text": "It has been shown previously that, similarly to 3C pro , 49, 52, 56 specific substrate binding by M pro is ensured by well-defined S1 and S2 binding pockets. 26 In addition, it has also been shown that the imidazole side chain of a conserved His residue, which is located in the center of a hydrophobic pocket, interacts with the P1 carboxamide side chain of the substrate.

In both M pro T and M pro H, the S2 pocket is lined by the side chains of His41, Thr47, Ile51, Leu164, and Pro188, despite residue Leu164 in M pro T being replaced by Ile. In M pro S, the S2 pocket is lined by the side chains of His41, Asp48, Pro52, Met165, and Gln189. It indicates that the S2 pocket is not as conserved as the S1 pocket, probably because the S2 subsite is located at the open mouth of the catalytic cleft formed by domains I and II, while the S1 subsite is situated in the very bottom of this cleft. Thus, the structural conservation of the substrate binding subsite S1 is necessary to maintain the structural integrity of both domains I and II. It is worth mentioning that the main chain of Leu164 of M pro T (or Ile164 of M pro H or Met165 of M pro S) forms part of the S1 subsite while its side chain is involved in the S2 subsite. It indicates that these two subsites are somewhat influenced by each other towards substrate binding. Fig. 6 shows the ASAs of both S1 and S2 subsites for M pro T, M pro H, M pro ST, and M pro SH as a function of MD simulation time. Both subsites are flexible enough to accommodate the substrates. In order to gain a clearer look of these structures, the snapshots of both S1 and S2 subsites for these proteins with the smallest and largest ASAs sampled from the 200 ps MD simulations are illustrated in Fig. 7 . The smallest ASA of S1 is 212, 95.4, 150, and 233 \u00c5 2 sampled at 38, 116, 146, and 2 ps, while the largest ASA of S1 is 360, 158, 286, and 361 \u00c5 2 sampled at 88, 30, 28, and 94 ps for M pro T, M pro H, M pro ST, and M pro SH, respectively.

It is interesting that the sizes and conformations of the smallest and the largest S1 pocket of M pro SH are very similar to those of M pro T. The variation of the size and conformation of S2 subsite for these proteins is more significant than the S1 subsite during the MD simulations, probably because S2 is fully exposed to the solvent and is easy to be subjected to structural change.
