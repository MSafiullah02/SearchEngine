Through unbiased sequencing of patient samples, a previously unknown \u03b2-cyclotron virus was discovered. A novel coronavirus was isolated from human airway epithelial cells and termed SARS CoV2, responsible for Coronavirus Disease (COVID)-19. Like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, COVID-19 is the 7th member of the coronavirus family which infects humans [1]. The source of infection is wild animals, possibly rhinolophus sinicus. Importantly, the virus can be transmitted from human to human. At present, COVID-19 has been mainly breaking out in Wuhan, and by February 8th, 2020, a total of 34627 cases had been confirmed, of which 732 cases had died. These numbers are still increasing.",

These patients had clinical symptoms including fever and cough. Imaging plays an important role in the diagnosis and evaluation of the disease [2,3]. Final diagnosis relies on real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) positivity for the presence of coronavirus [4,5]. Because of the strong infectivity of COVID-19, rapid and accurate diagnostic methods are urgently required to identify, isolate and treat the patients as soon as possible, which could reduce mortality rates and the risk of public contamination. However, rRT-PCR results often require 5 to 6 hours, whereas CT examinations results can be obtained much faster. Additionally, it remains unclear whether rRT-PCR is the gold standard, and whether false-positive or false-negative results are common.",

This may be related to sample collection as pharyngeal oral and nasal sampling are easier collection methods, whereas lower respiratory tract sampling is relatively difficult to perform, with medical staff susceptible to get infected [16]. The sensitivity of the rRT-PCR kit can also contribute to false negatives. Chung reported that 3 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia showed normal CT findings [2]. In this study, only one patient was observed with positive rRT-PCR but negative CT. Considering that the results of rRT-PCR may be false-negative, and the relatively long assay time, we recommend that the patients with typical imaging findings should be isolated and rRT-PCR repeated to avoid misdiagnosis.",

In these patients, the total number of leukocytes was normal or decreased, similar to previous reported in the literature[10,[17], [18], [19]]. Interestingly, we found that more patients with increased blood glucose levels were observed in the COVID-19 pneumonia group as compared to the control group (47.2% vs 27.5%), although the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.058). It remains unclear how many patients in this group will finally be diagnosed with diabetes, but those with high blood fasting glucose level might be more sensitive to COVID-19 pneumonia, which requires further confirmation. The typical imaging features of COVID-19 pneumonia consist in single or multiple patchy consolidations or GGO in both lungs. In this study, GGO with consolidation was the commonest abnormality. The distribution of the lesions was predominantly peripheral, seen in 72.2% of patients. Pleural effusion and lymphadenopathy were rarely observed, consistent with previous studies [[20], [21], [22]].",
