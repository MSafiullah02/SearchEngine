The validity of MBI is well supported in the literature; it has a Cronbach alpha rating of 0.9 for emotional exhaustion, 0.76 for depersonalization, and 0.76 for personal accomplishment [2]. The Professional Quality of Life Scale (ProQoL) was used to assess compassion satisfaction; it included three subscale measures of compassion satisfaction, burnout, and secondary traumatic stress; each subscale has a reported alpha reliability greater than 0.7 [21]. The Perceived Stress Scale was used to assess perceived stress. The PSS has a Cronbach alpha rating > 0.7 [22]. We developed a short additional post-intervention survey which included a free text section to provide feedback on the interventions (Appendix 1). The post-intervention survey was developed using expert opinion, supported by the use of participant evaluations completed in similar studies [23].",

During \u201cRecognise and Reflect\u201d, midwives were encouraged to reflect on the previous shift, discuss the good aspects of the clinical day, and identify any issues which arose, in a non-judgmental environment. Participants were encouraged to voice any ideas for improving clinical practice, and these ideas were documented and passed on to appropriate officials. One team bonding session was held for DITs.

The post-intervention questionnaires were not distributed to the DITs.

The small sample size and poor response rate post-intervention significantly limits the ability to conclude on improvements in wellbeing following the intervention. The poor response rate warrants further discussion. Although participants were anonymized, it may reflect the sensitive nature of the questions in the survey. Another possible contributing factor was that surveys were distributed while the midwives were at work, and professional commitments were prioritized over completing the surveys. These explanations do not explain the lower response rate post-intervention. It is possible that the declining response rate may have been due to a decreased interest in the study following discontinuation of the \u201cRecognise and Reflect\u201d sessions. Further research investigating barriers to midwives completing surveys is needed. Another limitation was excluding the DITs from post-intervention data collection.

This may have resulted in type 1 error when assessing the impact of the intervention on burnout, compassion fatigue, and perceived stress. Furthermore, the positive feedback on the intervention may not be representative of the views of all the midwives working in the labour ward.
