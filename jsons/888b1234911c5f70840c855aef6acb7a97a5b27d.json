By defining bronchiolitis as a wheezing episode in infants younger than 24 months, they might have included infants with wheezing, but they were unable to detect other respiratory viruses in infants with non-RSV bronchiolitis. In contrast, when Koponen et al. (26) looked at a cohort of infants aged less than six months hospitalised for bronchiolitis, they found that the risk of asthma was lower after RSV bronchiolitis than after bronchiolitis caused by other respiratory viruses. The study retrospectively analysed the presence of nine viruses during acute bronchiolitis, but no single virus was predominant in the non-RSV group with current asthma. To our knowledge, our study is the first to simultaneously compare 14 respiratory viruses and only show a correlation between rhinovirus bronchiolitis and recurrent wheezing at the age of three years.

If other studies confirm our latest findings, the major viruses that contribute to the development of recurrent wheezing after bronchiolitis might be rhinoviruses rather than RSV. Further studies are needed to clarify this important finding. One clinically important difference that we observed between the three groups in our study was the significantly higher numbers of blood eosinophil in infants with recurrent wheezing.
