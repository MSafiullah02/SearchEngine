            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), caused by an inappropriate immune response to feline coronavirus (FCoV) infection, is currently said to be the leading infectious cause of death amongst pedigree cats and cats from shelters (Vennema et al., 1998 ). Yet little is known about this virus and the pathogenesis of FIP and, despite over 30 years of research, many questions remain unanswered. In this issue of the Journal, Kiss et al. (2000) have contributed one more part to the FCoV jigsaw. FCoV is incredibly difficult to isolate, which has hampered research, but Kiss et al., used molecular biological techniques to determine how many clinically healthy pet cats in Eastern Hungary were shedding virus and to examine the relatedness of the viruses found. FCoV was found in 36 of 113 (31.8%) cats sampled: this proportion was perhaps artificially increased by 15 of the cats coming from two Persian breeding catteries, 12 of which were positive. Eighty-eight of the remaining 98 cats were from single cat households, so if 24 were RT-PCR positive, then it would appear that around 24% of normal pet cats sheds FCoV (although again this proportion could be artificially increased if the undefined 10 all come from one household and a high proportion were shedding FCoV). The situation in the Persian breeding households serves to illustrate that FCoV shedding increases in situations where many cats are kept together, perhaps indoors, sharing litter trays, and where there is frequent exposure to other sources of FCoV through mating and possibly cat shows (Kiss et al., 2000) .",

            "text": "FCoV is an RNA virus and therefore its huge genome is relatively unstable; this feature allows scientists to compare isolates from various sources for similarity. Kiss et al. showed that, as suspected but only hitherto demonstrated in one household by Herrewegh et al., (1997) , FCoVs from different households formed a cluster, indicating that they had probably originated from one coronavirus. In addition, this finding seems to confirm Dr Herrewegh's suspicion that infection with one FCoV somehow conferred protection against other strains of FCoV (Herrewegh et al., 1997) . It used to be thought that cats seropositive to FCoV were more, not less, likely to develop FIP. The theory was that antibody caused enhanced infection enabling the virus to enter macrophages more easily (Weiss & Scott, 1981) and it was noted that experimental infections of seropositive cats resulted in more of the seropositive cats than seronegative control cats developing FIP and did so more rapidly. Observations of naturally infected cats seemed to refute that finding (Addie et al., 1995) : cats which had been exposed to FCoV infection appeared to be less, not more, likely to develop FIP. At last we have a possible explanation for that finding-that cats infected with one FCoV are resistant to superinfection by other FCoV strains. The consequences of these two schools of thought for practicing veterinary surgeons were exactly opposite-if one had to introduce a new cat into a household of seropositive cats it appeared from the experimental infections that it was safer to introduce a seronegative cat. Observation of naturally-infected animals showed that, in fact, it was safer to introduce a seropositive cat.",

There is absolutely no justification for euthanasing healthy FCoV excretors, as they may well stop shedding FCoV the next week or the next month-a fact that does not emerge in the Kiss paper, since they were looking at a single timepoint. In this author's experience, the only sure way to identify a FCoV carrier (i.e. a cat which will shed FCoV for life) is by monthly faecal testing for at least a year showing uninterrupted virus shedding (unpublished data)",

Does the book succeed? In part, yes; but for this reviewer there was frustration with the format and the nature of some of the questions, with limited information provided in some answers. The cases are not grouped by systems, so that selection is random. If I wanted to test my knowledge on the urinary tract I could not focus on those questions without thumbing through the book, 'on search', or refer to the index and then go to different pages. Each question had laboratory values, but all reference ranges were in tables at the back of the book. Reference values would have been better given with each table in the text, especially for less common tests (e.g. parathormone). The answers provided frequently did not provide a recipe for action: 'Monitor the urine' and 'Check the pH' are unhelpful statements and do not tell the reader what to look for or how to act on the pH value measured.",
