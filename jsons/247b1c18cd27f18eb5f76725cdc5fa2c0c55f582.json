As the opioid epidemic continues to be problematic for physicians and patients, effective pain management techniques with an opioid-sparing effect are desired. Multimodal techniques afford significant pain relief; reduces opioid requirement, consumption, and related adverse effects; and expedites bowel recovery, earlier extubation, and overall shorter hospital stay (Mikhail and Thangathurai 1992; Aitkenhead 1989) . Therefore, a combination of low-dose analgesics should be used and tailored to the patient's clinical needs and nature of surgery.",

With multimodal techniques, specifically ketamine, fentanyl, and low-dose adjunct agents, we found that the overall opioid-sparing effect contributes to a reduction in ventilator-dependent days by up to 20%, faster bowel recovery and thus shorter hospital stay by 1-2 days, minimal vital organ dysfunction, and fewer psychological issues. Thus, patient wellness is optimized in the ICU with a multimodal approach to postoperative pain tailored to the patient's needs.",
