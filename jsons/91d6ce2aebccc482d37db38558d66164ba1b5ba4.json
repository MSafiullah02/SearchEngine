[1] [2] The COVID-19 pandemic has been spreading worldwide rapidly since March 2020. As of late of April 2020, it was reported that more than 1,800,000 individuals had been diagnosed and this disease caused over 200,000 deaths. The rapid increase in cases has led to heavy burdens on public healthcare resources and medical facilities. [3] [4] According to the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis Program (5th edition), published by the National Health Commission of China, the disease severity of patients with COVID-19 can be divided into 4 categories, i.e. mild, moderate, severe and critical. 5 Current experience reveals that the majority of infected individuals (approx. over 80%) are not severely affected and can recover without medical intervention, whereas a small number of cases need to be carefully treated and hospitalized. [6] [7] [8] [9] The mortality rate for severe cases, particularly those who are critically ill, is quite high. It is therefore critical to identify reliable predictors for disease severity to improve outcomes and conserve medical resources.",

Patients with cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and other comorbidities are often subject to acute respiratory distress syndrome, shock, multi-organ failure, cytokine storm and other serious 6 complications in COVID-19. 8,10-12 These patients commonly have a poor prognosis. However, patients with moderate COVID-19 and no underlying diseases can also develop the complications described above and progress to the severe or critically ill types. 11, 13 According to the latest guidelines published by the National Health Commission of China, the diagnosis of severe and critically ill patients must rely on complex procedures such as imaging tests and blood gas analysis. In a pandemic situation, it is difficult to perform these diagnostic examinations on all patients. It is therefore particularly important to identify more easily detectable and earlier predictors to achieve extensive screening of patients and optimize the allocation of medical resources.",

However, it is still unclear which of these factors are the most sensitive and reliable indicators for predicting the prognosis of COVID-19 in the early stage. Besides, early indicators for disease classification are also urgently needed. In the present study, based on the clinical information of 142 patients with COVID-19, we compare and validate the predictive power of several reported risk factors for disease classification and prognosis in COVID-19 in a descriptive manner. 7 To investigate the mortality-associated risk factors, we initially collected clinical information from admission to discharge (or death) on a cohort of COVID-19 patients, dividing them into survivors (n=117) and non-survivors (n=15). Firstly, the baseline information of these patients was analyzed. We found that older patients, especially those over 90 years of age, had a higher risk of mortality (Table S1) . Female patients had a higher recovery rate and lower mortality rate than males (Table S1 ). The non-survivor group had a higher ratio of comorbidity, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, than the survivors (Table S2 ). In addition, relative to the cured patients, the non-survivors also had an increased incidence of complications like acute respiratory disease syndrome, septic shock, hemorrhagic shock, gastrointestinal bleeding, organ dysfunction and multiple organ failure (Table S3) .",

Among the critically ill, 15 patients died. The information on gender, age, comorbidities and complications in these patients were presented in Table S1-S4. All patients were confirmed by viral detections of SARS-CoV-2 via oropharyngeal swabs using quantitative RT-PCR for ORF1ab, which ruled out infection by other respiratory viruses such as influenza virus A, influenza virus B, coxsackie virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus and enterovirus. All cases were diagnosed and classified according to the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis Program (5th edition) published by the National Health Commission of China. Clinical manifestations consist of four categories, mild, moderate, severe and critically ill. The mild clinical symptom were mild with no pulmonary inflammation on imaging. The moderate is the overwhelming majority, showing symptoms of respiratory infections such as fever, cough, and sputum, and pulmonary inflammation on imaging; when symptoms of dyspnea appear, including any of the following: shortness of breath, RR \u2265 30bpm,",
