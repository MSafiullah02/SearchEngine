Lack of a fast, accurate, and memory efficient microsatellite discoverer motivated us to develop such a tool first, and then start analyzing the Covid-19 genome structure. Therefore, this research follows two objectives, development of a general microsatellite discoverer which can be used for different genomes, and analysis of the structures of both SARS-CoV-1 and that of Coronavirus-Covid-19 using this tool and revealing their differences. The final results will assist future investigations towards drug and vaccine design. Even very minor assistance in these directions can have a great impact on saving lives and elevating the quality of numerous human lives.",

They are classified into three classes, microsatellites, minisatellites and satellites. Different researchers and practitioners disagree where to draw the separating line between microsatellites, minisatellites and satellites; however, the number 7 appears very often as the longest length of the core subsequences of microsatellites (Pickett et al. 2016) . The core subsequence of microsatellites will be called motif, from here on. Another important feature of microsatellites, minisatellites and satellites is the number of repeats of the corresponding motifs. Once again, there is no clear-cut lower bound for the minimum number of repeats.",

VNTRs are very common in the human genome, and it is estimated that 3% of the human genome is composed of VNTRs (Farnoud et al. 2019) . The focus of this research is finding microsatellites with both a fixed number of tandem repeats and those in which the number of repeats vary in different individuals. The variability of the number of repeats in both microsatellites, which is called the number of repeats polymorphism, is a good candidate for an individual's DNA signature (Lang et al. 2019; Parson 2018) . Could it be the case for different varieties of the coronavirus? This has to be investigated after at least the microsatellites are all detected and reported.",

The need for research is growing, and its priorities are being set (Cowling and Leung 2020) . With respect to urgent drug discovery, the immediate effort is focused on repurposing drugs (Y. Zhou et al. 2020b) . In this respect, the study of virus-host and human-human protein-protein interactome networks is said to be essential (Mir et al. 2017; Y. Zhou et al. 2020b ). Another direction is the discovery of known patterns which have been the source of other diseases, in the genome of the Covid-19. It is estimated that there are 4.6 million microsatellites in the human genome (Srivastava et al. 2019) . Amplification of many of these microsatellites have been used for many purposes such as disease diagnosis or human observable characteristics segregation. Numerous researches have reported the association between different diseases and certain microsatellites (Kelkar et al. 2011; Liu et al. 2017) . For example, the instability nature of repeats in the microsatellites is associated with many kinds of cancer and a variety of disorders related to the nervous system's degeneration, such as Huntington's disease (Kovtun and McMurray 2008) . Even a repeat polymorphism in one of the genes, i.e., IL-lra, is shown to be associated with an increased possibility of osteoporotic fractures (Raje et al. 2013; Saadati and Rajabian 2008) . Having said so, accurately and efficiently locating microsatellites in a given genome or genomic sequence has been and still is an important issue.",

Generally speaking, the goal is either to find all kinds of tandem repeats (Kolpakov et al. 2003) or a subset of classes of tandem repeats such as microsatellites (Kovtun and McMurray 2008) with a variable number of repeats in different individuals or without it. From a different point of view, the outcome is either exact or inexact and for the case of inexact, it could be statistical (Landau et al. 2001) , fuzzy (Genovese et al. 2018) , based on distances such as Hamming or edit distance (Kolpakov et al. 2003) . To the best of our knowledge, there is no document with a complete classification of methods for finding tandem repeats and the first objective of this research is presenting a new approach to finding these repeats and not reviewing and classifying existing methods. Therefore, we will limit ourselves to documents which provide a tide background for the concept and introduce those documents which are used in the comparison sections. The software developed here is capable of finding all microsatellites of genomic sequences whatever their length might be. The main objective of this research is to use the developed system to recognize all microsatellites of the novel Coronavirus and that of SARS and highlight the differences. A detailed comparison will be provided.",

It has the capability of using a seed-and-extend concept to detect similar repeats. To check the atomicity of the core sequence, it searches a long list of possible core sequences, which is a time consuming process. Although we noticed it does not detect microsatellites with overlapped cores, it is a good candidate for the comparison with the method which is developed here.

A feature of mreps is that it can tolerate errors between repeated copies (Kolpakov et al. 2003) . With the generality, of course, comes slowness, usage complexity, and inaccuracy. For the case of Coronavirus which is composed of a short genome, fuzziness and inexactness is a weakness of the method.

It is based on the preparation of a repeated set in advance, and comparing all possible subsequences of the input sequence against this set, and then perform further processing, if a match happens. In the default option of this tool, all microsatellites of core lengths 1 to 6 are detected. To build the repeat set, all possible combinations of k-mers, for k=1 to 6, are generated, and each one is extended by contiguous repetition of the k-mer to 12 characters. A moving window with length 12 is initialized with the 12 first characters of the input sequence, and it searches in the repeat set. If it is found, further processing will follow to find all repeats; otherwise, the moving window is pushed one place forward and the process continues. The main difficulty with this approach is the search time in the repeat set, especially if microsatellites of longer core sizes are of users' interest. For example, if the core length is seven nucleotides, 4 7 rows have to be added to the repeat set. One other difficulty is that the tool is not capable of detecting microsatellites with a low number of repeats. For example, it would not be able to detect microsatellites with core size 1 in which the number of repeats are less than 12. It is possible to change the default values but, a high search time will persist and other problems may arise.",

By a simple replacement of U by T in the input sequence, the method presented here will hold valid and applicable. The length of the input sequence could be as long as the whole genome and as small as a few nucleotides. The problem is to find all successive tandem repeats of the same core sequence, i.e., same motif. The core sequences of microsatellites are considered to be of length 1, 2, ..., or 7 nucleotides. Further, we assume the core sequence is atomic. For example, ATAT is not atomic because it is composed of two identical ATs, and hence it should be reported as a microsatellite of core sequence AT, assuming it passes other requirements.",

The corresponding codes of the letters are 00, 01, 10, and 11, respectively. For example, the subsequence ACCTGA would be converted to the integer 000101111000 in base 2 which is equal to decimal number 376. Decoding this code will take us to row number 376 of the Table KMHI. Note that the first row is numbered zero. The table has 212 = 4096 rows. Although all microsatellites of sizes 1 to 7 are to be found, only one KMHT is produced, and the unit subsequence for the hashing purpose is always 6. Other options such as units of four were examined, and considering the overall performance and flexibility, 6 was selected. In the following, the details of detecting actual microsatellites will be described using an example.",

This coding system has two major advantages, a no-space requirement for storing search-key values and negligible decoding time requirement. With the big data production and fast analysis requirements, KHMI is a good candidate to be used in many fields of bioinformatics. Let us say the hash of a search-key value is interpreted as an integer variable x, then its decoding is equivalent to going to KMHI(x), i.e., Row x of Table KMHI. The simplest approach is to attach a link list to each row of the KMHI, and as the input is scanned, store the position of each k-mer in the link list which corresponds to this k-mer. After the end of the input sequence is reached, then each linked list is separately processed, and microsatellites are detected. In this approach, for each character of the input sequence, a node of a list is formed, and in each node a location and a pointer is stored. Therefore, the storage requirement forces the software to rely on the secondary storage which makes the time requirement intolerable. Besides, processing the links is another factor which adds to the computation time. In this research, a novel idea was developed which removes all the linked lists and instead, for each kmer includes only three values in the KMHI table. The software system which is developed around this idea to find all microsatellites of a genomic sequence is called Fast Microsatellite Discoverer (FMSD).",

This 6-mer points to row number 3035 of the KMHI table. Suppose the same 6-mer is repeated 4 positions later, i.e., in Positions 409 to 414. This will point to the same row number 3035 of the KMHI. With respect to this row, we can guess that perhaps a microsatellite, actually GTTC, is forming, because two of them have been already observed. At this point, Row 3035 will store three values, loc which is equal to 414, size which is equal to 4, and count which is equal to 2.

It discovers the microsatellites with the smallest number of repeats compared to state-of-the-art packages. It is fast while being a sequential software. Since potential microsatellites are detected as the input is scanned, the method which is developed here can easily become parallel to further improve its run time and make use of all cores of computers. It is also memory efficient. Since correctness and timing are the most important objectives of such algorithms, Table 1 shows the time requirement of different software for different sizes of genomes. The timing of all methods are measured with an Intel Xeon E5-6695 v3 2.3Gigahertz processor with a 64GB main memory module. It is clearly notable that the time requirement of FMSD is far less than those of other algorithms. In some cases, it is 3600 times faster ,and in the worst case it is at least 2.6 times faster than the state-of-the art method. This offers a great advantage, because most genomic sequences are very long and previous methods may not be capable to perform their tasks in a tolerable period of time. The same discussion is true for main memory utilization; however, since other methods did not reported the memory utilization of their algorithms and the source codes (not the executable code) are not available, comparison is not possible. An important objective of this research is to find all microsatellites of both the SARS and Coronavirous-Covid-19, and provide the required information for the geneticist to analyze their differences towards drug discovery and vaccine production. This is done in the next subsection. *This package does not find microsatellites of size 7 core substrings.",

The results are shown for all microsatellites with atomic core lengths of less than or equal to 7. The minimum number of repeats is set to 3 except for atomic core lengths of 1 and 2 which is set to 7 and 4, respectively. Table 2 lists all microsatellites in both viruses. A polyAdenine (PolyA) tail is seen in Coronavirus-Covid-19 which is absent in SARS-CoV-1. Yet the longest sequence of Adenine in SARS-CoV-1 is of length 8 which is located somewhere within the genome. In addition, the maximum length of atomic simple tandem repeats found in these two genomes were 4 nucleotides (TGTT), which is repeated three times in SARS-CoV-1 genome and two times in Coronavirus-Covid-19 genome.",

Another microsatellite found in both genomes is CAA (poly glutamine, PolyQ, at protein level). It is shown that PolyQ is involved in transmissibility of cowpox virus, while lacking of such motif in smallpox leads to less survival of this virus (Schein 2019) . It is worth mentioning that a point mutation in the Covid-19 genome compared to SARS-CoV-1 genome might cause the software to find two different microsatellites in the two genomes. For example, segment TTGTGTGTGTA can be read as 4 repeats of TG or 5 repeats of GT assuming a recent mutation from G to T at the beginning of the segment. Therefore, some differences might not be as significant as they look. Since Covid-19 recently jumped from animal to human host, it has not yet adapted to its new environment; hence its genome shows a rapid dynamics",

Being in the same family, it is important to explore the genomic structural differences to look for Covid-19's specific behavior. There is a hope that it might help drug repurposing for symptom relief in the short term, and vaccine design in the long term. To this aim, a highly time and space efficient software called fast microsatellite discoverer, FMSD, was developed first. Its performance was evaluated and reported to be superior than existing systems. A great novelty that makes FMSD suitable is analysis of genomic sequences of any lengths, whether short, long, or very long. Using FMSD, all microsatellites of both SARS-CoV-1 and Covid-19 were discovered and reported. There are many differences. Although the interpretations of some of the differences are provided, further investigations are needed for possible clues to treatment and drug and vaccine design. Note that tandem repeats are reported to be the cause of many diseases. The links to other software used in this project are also provided. In addition, the links to SARS and Covid19 genomes are provided at the following links: ",
