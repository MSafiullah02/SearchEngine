This new information, in concert with genomic information from multicellular organisms such as the Anopheles mosquito, offers significant promise for the development of new therapies and vaccines. Careful analysis of the genomes of pathogens will continue to yield important information about the pathogenesis of infection. For example, genome sequencing of group A streptococci, collected over time with relevant robust clinical information, has detected the acquisition of new determinants (often by prophage) responsible for increased virulence and resulting in toxic shock syndrome, necrotizing fasciitis, or both. Proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and virulomics have transformed research on infectious diseases and promise significant improvements in diagnostics and therapeutics in the future.",

For example, an overvigorous response, with generation of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, may accentuate the development of cerebral complications in falciparum malaria. Analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms of the human genome will lead to an enhanced understanding of two fundamental issues in infectious diseases: why invasive, overt disease develops in only a small fraction of individuals colonized with a given microbe, and why infections are more severe in some people than in others. Variants in genes that encode molecules that mediate attachment, pathogen recognition, inflammatory cytokine response, and innate and adaptive immunity are being identified at an astonishing rate.",

The identification of pattern recognition receptors (e.g., Toll-like receptors [TLRs] and nucleotide oligomerization domain [NOD]-like receptors) that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns, as well as endogenous substances reflecting tissue injury (e.g., alarmins), has revolutionized our understanding of the early host response to infection. Agonists or antagonists of TLRs have already entered clinical trials as adjuvant therapies (e.g., editoran for sepsis) or to improve the immunogenicity of vaccines. The other area that has exploded recently is the study of antimicrobial peptides (e.g., defensins, cathecidins, histatins, galectins) and their role in the early response to infectious disorders.",

This disconnect has been the focus of meetings among the pharmaceutical industry, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Food and Drug Administration, and others. Multiresistant pneumococci, vancomycin resistance in S. aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and, perhaps most important, multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli (MDR-GNB) are just a few examples. Some MDR-GNB are susceptible to only a few agents of \u201clast resort,\u201d such as colistin or tigecycline; others are truly untreatable (Chapter 313). Unfortunately, new agents active against these strains are years, if not decades, away from introduction.",

Conditions for which there is some evidence (but not conclusive proof) of an infectious basis include diabetes, atherosclerosis, acute leukemia, collagen vascular diseases, and inflammatory bowel disease. Detection of \u201cuncultivatable\u201d microorganisms by newer techniques, such as 16S RNA analysis, may uncover agents responsible for \u201cnoninfectious\u201d diseases or suggest a role in conditions that are considered infectious but in which the pathogen or pathogens are controversial (e.g., bacterial vaginosis). In addition, we know that hepatitis C virus, human papillomavirus, and Helicobacter pylori cause human cancers. Furthermore, changes in our own microbiome may lead to disease. Alterations in the gut microbiome are associated with obesity. Another recent example comes from experiments with mice lacking TLR5. These mice develop hyperphagia and hallmark features of the metabolic syndrome, including hyperlipidemia, hypertension, insulin resistance, and increased adiposity, associated with an altered gut microbiome. Further, transfer of this changed microbiota into germ-free wild-type mice induces most features of the metabolic syndrome in the recipients.",
