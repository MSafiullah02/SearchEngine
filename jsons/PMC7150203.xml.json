The hurdles encountered include refrigeration, transport, and the need for health professionals to administer the vaccine, all which have led to higher cost. All of the shortcomings of traditional vaccinations have become a deterrent in our effort to improve world health standards. In order to ameliorate these problems, alternative vaccination routes such as oral, nasal, or buccal offer new hope. Among the alternative routes, the oral route is preferred as a result of its advantages over the other routes.",

The advantages of oral vaccines include improved patient compliance, ease of administration, and lower cost of production and transportation. They also serve as an alternative to the needle phobic, including young children and the elderly. More importantly, oral vaccines are capable of inducing both mucosal and systemic immunity. Recent studies have suggested that in order to produce a more effective vaccine, both systemic and mucosal immunity has to be induced.2 Nevertheless, the oral delivery of proteins and vaccines faces major physiological barriers such as the acidic environment in the stomach and the enzymatic environment throughout the intestine, as well as formulation challenges such as stability and targeting issues.",

Unlike the delivery of small molecules, these products have special considerations that make it a challenge to deliver them to the site of action or its receptor. The most important consideration is the stability of the active protein or peptide in the formulation and maintaining its basic structure and its tertiary structure to obtain optimal effect. The ideal delivery system would protect the protein, peptide, or antigen from the physiological conditions encountered during administration and allow it to retain its structure (both primary and tertiary) until it reaches its site of action.",

Proteins and peptides are formed by binding of various amino acids. There are 20 naturally occurring amino acids, and they differ only in their side chains. Proteins contain more than 50 amino acids, whereas peptides contain fewer than 20 amino acids. The four levels of protein structures are primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary. The primary structure includes the sequence of covalently bonded amino acids, and it is dictated by the sequence of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Secondary structures consist of \u03b1-helixes, \u03b2-sheets, random coils, \u03b2-bends, and small loops of the polypeptide chain. The tertiary structure of proteins includes the overall packing in space of various elements of secondary structures, and quaternary structures represent the specific associations of separate protein chains that form a well-defined structure.5 The primary structure of protein dictates its folding process. Generally, the overall shape is spherical with polar groups on the surface and hydrophobic groups buried in the interior. The fold structure of proteins is stabilized by both noncovalent and covalent forces. These forces include disulfide bridges between cysteine residues, hydrogen bonding, salt bridges between ionic groups, and hydrophobic interactions between side chains of amino acid residues.",

            "text": "It is evident from the above discussion that proteins have very intricate structures, which make the formulation of proteins a challenging task. In order to successfully formulate a protein, its stability and bioactivity must be maintained over its shelf life (1.5 to 2 years) and until it reaches the intended target. Any subtle changes in the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure will lead to physical instabilities such as denaturation, aggregation, precipitation, and adsorption. In addition, hydrolysis, deamidation, oxidation, disulfide exchange, \u03b2-elimination, and racemization will lead to chemical instability of proteins. Hence, all of these degradation pathways need to be avoided during the formulation process, and a strategy to minimize the probability of their induction should be in place. These strategies include reducing thermal stress by using the lowest temperature possible while spray drying and storing the protein at 4\u00b0C at pH 5.0 to 7.0. Harsh chemicals such as strong acids, bases, and organic solvents will disrupt the higher order structure of proteins, so their use should be avoided or minimized during the formulation process. Aqueous systems should be used rather than organic solvents. Additionally, any energy input such as shaking, vortexing, sonication, temperature increase, radiation, or ultrasound or changes in pH, ionic strength, salt concentration, buffer type, and solvent composition should be minimized to prevent the development of aggregation and eventually other degradation pathways.",

            "text": "Sluzky et al.6 found significantly higher aggregations of insulin solutions in vials with overhead space and with the addition of Teflon\u00ae beads compared to aggregations of insulin in fully filled vials. This is due to the creation of air\u2013water interphase in the partially filled vial, and Teflon beads create hydrophobic surfaces that induce aggregation.6 Also, it has been demonstrated that vortexing causes aggregation of human growth hormone.2 Another stress that proteins undergo during the manufacturing process is lyophilization. In lyophilization, the proteins will be exposed to moisture and elevated temperatures. Optimal moisture content actually is essential for protein stability; however, when moisture content increases above the monolayer level, other reactants at the vicinity will be mobilized, leading to aggregation, especially at elevated temperature during lyophilization.2 For this reason, cryoprotectants such as trehalose and sucrose and lyoprotectants such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) are commonly used to stabilize the protein during lyophilization. Cryoprotectants are preferentially excluded from the protein, whereas lyoprotectants act as a water substitute and hence stabilize the folded structure of proteins. Surfactants such as Polysorbate 20, 40, 60, and 80 stabilize protein by preferential adsorption at the interphase, whereas preservatives such as phenol, m-cresol, chlorobutanol, and parabens reduce microbial contamination.",

For oral delivery, it has been reported that particles of size less than 5 \u03bcm with positive charge and a hydrophobic nature can preferentially enter the Peyer\u2019s patch of the small intestine.18 Orally delivered vaccines, especially particulate antigens, are recognized and sampled by microfold (M) cells in Peyer\u2019s patches. This is followed by transport of the particles to underlying follicles and to professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells and macrophages. These APCs can phagocytose the particles, process them, and present them on both major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I (through cross priming) and MHC class II molecules; as a result, both T and B cells can be triggered, as shown in Figure 5.1\n.19., 20.\n",

M cells, or microfold cells, act as sampling ports for any foreign entities encountered in the small intestine. These M cells house various dendritic cells and immune cells. For oral vaccines, particles are sampled by M cells, processed by dendritic cells or antigen-presenting cells, and presented on MHC class I or class II molecules. The antigens are further recognized by the immune cells in the vicinity, leading to the cascade of an immune response as shown in Figure 5.1. The immune response also includes a humoral response by plasma B cells that leads to production of antibodies and their class switching. The role of B cells has been debatable in the past, but a recent study by Mahmoud et al.23 showed that humoral immunity is important in addition to cell-mediated immunity in the prognosis of cancer. Thus, this route can trigger both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses to various cancer vaccines or biologics. The use of microparticles for cancer therapies and the delivery of biologics via the oral route are discussed further later in this chapter.",

The lungs provide a large absorptive surface area (up to 100 m2), an extremely thin (0.1 to 0.2 \u03bcm) absorptive mucosal membrane, and excellent vascularization, but it is challenging to incorporate the drug in a formulation that will deliver it to such a depth in the lungs that will permit permeation of the drug into blood circulation. The respiratory system is equipped with a series of filters designed to protect the lungs from undesirable environmental material and to keep the lungs clean. This factor must be taken into consideration for a particular therapy to be sufficiently effective. Low efficiency and a large variability have been the major factors that have prevented this route of administration from gaining complete acceptance.

The bolus delivery technique can help to increase particle deposition in the lungs. Nectar Therapeutics, along with Pfizer, came up with Exubera\u00ae for the inhalable delivery of insulin for the treatment of diabetes. This form of insulin was expected to replace all forms of injected insulin but the product lasted on the market for only little over a year after being introduced in September 2006. It was soon recalled, as it was cost ineffective and provided the same efficacy as injected insulin. Since then, a number of other companies (e.g., MannKind Corporation, Aerogen, Dance Biopharm) have been attempting to develop a form of inhalable insulin that is less expensive to produce than Exubera.",

The particles ranged in size from 0.165 to 1.5 \u03bcm. This formulation was delivered transdermally by creating microchannels in the skin of four- to six-week-old DBA-2/J mice, using the DermaRoller\u00ae, a device that uses microneedle technology. In vivo studies showed that the vaccine produced an increase in immune response. A significant increase in the IgG antibody titers was observed which may have been the result of uptake and presentation of antigen by the Langerhans cells in the skin. Also, the vaccinated mice showed no palpable tumor even when observed for 35 days after tumor induction. Thus, transdermal microparticle delivery of vaccines opens up new avenues for vaccine administration with the use of rather non-invasive methodologies that require further modifications and testing in a clinical setting.",

These are advantageous because their small size allows them to penetrate through the hair follicles and cause the vaccine antigens to target the antigen-presenting cells and augment the immune response. Additionally, their interaction with skin lipids results in the generation of transient and reversible openings of the stratum corneum.52 Polymers such as polylactic acid, polylactic-co-glycolic acid, and chitosan have shown promise in transdermal immunization by eliciting strong immune responses.53., 54. Liposomes are other exciting carrier system for delivery of vaccines via the transdermal route. The lipid-based vesicles of liposomes, especially elastic liposome, may change the bioactive permeation kinetics due to an impaired barrier function of the stratum corneum, helpful for the skin penetration.55 Liposomes are generally composed of phosphatidylcholine and a surfactant and contain a lipid bilayer enveloping an aqueous compartment, which has a large capacity for loading drugs or vaccines.

There are many potential sources of tumor antigens, including puri\ufb01ed or synthesized tumor cell surface molecules, which may be peptides or proteins, cells or lysates derived from fresh or cryopreserved autologous tumor samples (actually a mixture of normal and malignant cells), and cells or lysates of allogeneic or autologous tumor cell lines. There are a variety of methods by which tumor antigens can be presented including as puri\ufb01ed antigen, via heat shock proteins, in viruses or DNA, by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells, or as the idiotypes of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that have been selected by their tumor antigen recognition.

Still, many researchers are focused on the aspect of formulating vaccines using novel delivery systems such as microparticles and nanoparticles. This chapter touches upon some of the research carried out in our laboratory on oral microparticulate vaccine or biologics delivery. It had long been assumed that if cancer vaccines could elicit a strong enough immune response they could overcome tumor-induced immune suppression, but after poor clinical results for so many promising vaccines it is now being realized that immunogenicity is not enough. In addition to a strong vaccine, tumor-induced immunosuppression must be actively reduced, and this may be achieved through combination with the arsenal of chemotherapy agents already in use.73 In a Phase III trial for sipileucel-T (Provenge\u00ae, Dendreon Corporation), the first autologous vaccine consisted of activated dendritic cells comprised of granulocyte\u2013macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) approved by the FDA for treatment of advanced prostate cancer. This vaccine included a large proportion of antigen-presenting cells, which were infused back into the patient to stimulate antitumor T-cell responses.74 The results showed higher median overall survival compared to placebo-treated patients, resulting in a 22% relative reduction in the risk of death, but it failed to show benefit in progression-free survival, and tumor regressions were rare.60., 61. This is an example of a personalized vaccine.",

Oral administration is a potential route for vaccination because there is no need for trained medical personnel for administration, thus leading to increased coverage of vaccination, as seen in case of oral polio vaccination.94 Development of a novel influenza oral vaccine will have a significant impact on improving public health.95 In one case study, microparticulate vaccine was developed by using inactivated influenza (A/PR/34/8 H1N1) virus as an antigen, which was incorporated into a polymer matrix (Eudragit\u00ae S).96 For in vivo testing, BALB/c mice were immunized with two doses within a three-week interval. Serum samples was analyzed and proved that microparticulate vaccine enhanced antigen-specific antibodies (Figure 5.5\n). Also, these mice were challenged with heterologous influenza viruses, and the results showed a significant induction level of protection via this technology.96\n",

The mechanism of immune system activation by the oral route is explained in the earlier section of this chapter. Our laboratory has also explored several targeting ligands that target M cells in order to enhance site-specific uptake of microparticles. Microparticles are formulated using the spray-drying technology with enteric polymers that fall under the Generally Regarded as Safe (GRAS) category classified by the FDA. Preliminary studies in our laboratory evaluated the efficacy of a microparticulate whole cell lysate vaccine of TRAMP-C2 prostate cancer cells as a prophylactic cancer vaccine therapy. It was observed that tumor growth was significantly retarded in vaccinated mice compared to the control group.111 Recently, Chiriva-Internati et al.112 isolated and tested AKAP-4 as a target for prostate cancer-specific immunotherapy. Our lab is currently exploring the efficacy of therapeutic oral microparticulate vaccines for prostate cancer.

The mucosal route of entry and initiation of primary immune response is well established where pathogens and other invasive microbes enter the host system via regions in the small intestine. Bernadette et al.128 described a study wherein they formulated a novel prophylactic oral microparticulate vaccine composed of whole cell lysate for melanoma using the spray-drying technique. Surface morphology of microparticles evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that the particles had a spherical surface with a size distribution of around 1 to 2 \u03bcm (Figure 5.8\n). They used an M-cell targeting ligand called aleuria aurantia lectin (ALL) that improved the uptake into the Peyer\u2019s patches of the small intestine. The results suggested that melanoma antigen microparticles were able to significantly increase the antibody titers in the mice for groups containing the lectin ligand in comparison to the other groups involved in the study. The serum IgG response of orally immunized mice with AAL ligand in the vaccine was compared with the oral group without AAL and showed a significant increase in serum IgG titer. The results of the tumor challenge study showed that the group vaccinated with AAL-associated microparticles showed the highest level of protection against tumor development. Thus, in the future, when designing oral particulate vaccines, AAL may be incorporated in the formulation as the targeting ligand.",

In the vaccinated group, there was a sixfold tumor suppression as compared to the placebo. However, there was not much difference between the vaccine group and the group with interleukins, which could possibly be due to low concentrations of the interleukins.",

The results from the ELISA showed increased IgG titer in vaccinated mice as opposed to nonvaccinated mice. Thus, both the subtypes of IgGs indicate that a mixed Th1 and Th2 type response was generated in the vaccine-only group. But, a Th2 type response was triggered among the interleukin group. This difference could be attributed to the effect of interleukins on the Peyer\u2019s patches which has been previously reported as a strategy for increasing the immune response for oral vaccine. Similar studies were carried out by Marinaro et al.135 where IL-12 was given orally to mice immunized with oral tetanus toxoid and cholera toxin. Their studies showed that oral IL-12 resulted in a TH2 response to the oral vaccine, and a TH1 response occurred when IL-12 was given via the intraperitoneal route.",
