FCoV infections are often subclinical, but may result in a number of problematic conditions such as acute and chronic diarrhoea, stunting of kittens or transient upper respiratory signs in newly infected kittens and cats, and faecal incontinence in persistently infected carrier cats (Addie and Jarrett, 1992; Kipar et al., 1998).

There is an urgent need of methods to prevent cats in high density environments such as breeding and rescue catteries becoming infected with FCoV. An FIP vaccine is licensed in some countries, but the first dose is administered at 16 weeks (Gerber et al., 1990) which is too late to protect kittens, that are usually infected when maternally derived antibody wanes at between five and seven weeks of age (Addie and Jarrett, 1992; Pedersen et al., 1981). At present, therefore, the major way to prevent FIP is to prevent exposure to the virus by quarantine and rigorous hygiene. FCoV transmission is faecal-oral; sharing litter trays with a FCoV shedder and fomite transmission are the major risk factors for uninfected cats. In dry indoor environments, FCoV can survive up to seven weeks in fomites (Scott, 1988).",

Mutian\u00ae X (Nantong Mutian Biotechnology Co. Ltd. China) is one of those products, it is formulated in capsules containing nicotinamide mononucleotide, Crocin I, S-Adenosylmethionine, Silymarin and Mutian X, which is a novel synthetic adenosine analogue (patent pending in China), exhibiting broad-spectrum activity against RNA viruses (Tony Xue, CEO of Nantong, personal communication). Nucleoside analogues function by replacing adenosine, thus terminating replication of the RNA virus genome. Mutian X is efficacious by the oral route unlike previously described anti-coronavirus drugs, which must be given by painful injection, often causing severe inflammatory responses (Pedersen et al., 2019), which is of concern for the development of feline injection site sarcoma.",

Advice from those with FIP experience is likely to reduce unnecessary use of anti-coronavirus drugs: in two of the five households reported here FIP therapy levels of anti-viral treatment was begun in two cats which did not have FIP, and ceased when a proper diagnosis was obtained: anti-viral treatment has been stopped in nine other mis-diagnosed cats (DA personal observation). We present an observational study of cat guardians who were using Mutian X to stop their cats from shedding virus, and have defined a protocol which optimises and minimises its use. Furthermore, we hope that by stopping cats shedding FCoV, especially in purebred cats, the prevalence of FIP will reduce, which will further reduce the use of unlicensed drugs.",

Some opinion leaders have expressed concern that use of Mutian X to stop virus shedding in cats without FIP will lead to drug resistance and failure of the drug to treat FIP, although the ability of Mutian X to treat FIP has not actually yet been documented, so far as we are aware. We ask those holding such views to consider the following: first that this drug is already being used for the purpose of virus elimination by cat guardians and surely it is better that a proper protocol has been developed, rather than they are left to do trial and error themselves. Second, we have found that an intensive four day course stopped virus shedding while cats being treated for FIP have higher virus loads (Kipar et al., 2006) and require a longer course of treatment, up to 12 weeks (Pedersen et al., 2019), which surely is more likely to allow resistant virus strains to develop? Indeed, virus resistance to a nucleoside analogue was documented in a cat being treated for FIP (Pedersen et al., 2019). Anti-virals are used prophylactically in other viral infections: there is precedent for this approach.",

In our view treating breeding queens for four days to stop FCoV shedding is less likely to induce drug resistance than treating at least one in ten of their kittens for FIP, requiring 12 weeks of medication. However, treatment of virus shedding cats must be done properly: one concern is that cat guardians may be tempted to reduce cost and use an insufficient dose or duration of treatment (SC and DDA, personal observations), which might result in selection of viruses which are resistant to Mutian X. Another concern is that a blunderbuss approach may be taken: treating all the cats in a household without first confirming that they are virus shedders.",

Cats do spontaneously stop shedding FCoV some months post-infection: FCoV-I is shed in the faeces for months to years (Addie et al., 1995; Addie and Jarrett, 2001; Addie et al., 2003). Little is known about FCoV-II shedding, in one experimental infection of laboratory cats virus was shed for up to 15 days (Stoddart et al., 1988); and no persistently FCoV-II infected cat has been reported (Addie and Jarrett, 2001; Addie et al., 2003). That said, it is unlikely that 29 cats would all cease virus shedding co-incidentally within days of beginning Mutian X treatment, we did retrospectively compare the results prior to Mutian X, when virus eradication was attempted by quarantine and hygiene, and/or itraconazole, and FeIFN\u03c9 with and without probiotics.",

However, in Household A, virus load did decrease in two cats on probiotics (Fortiflora, Purina Pro Plan, USA) and FeIFN\u03c9, but remained at a constant level in the third cat. Therefore, a combination of interferon and probiotics may have reduced FCoV shedding. FeIFN\u03c9 has previously been shown to reduce, but not stop, FCoV shedding (Gil et al., 2013). Probiotics are routinely used to treat children with viral diarrhoea (Szajewska et al., 2019), but the interaction of the gut microbiome and FCoV has not been extensively explored (Meazzi et al., 2019): further investigation into the possibility that probiotics might reduce coronavirus load is warranted.",

In Household C, re-infection of cat C6 occurred in less than nine days: she was housed with one cat who had failed to clear the virus on a 2 mg/kg dose of Mutian X; the cat litter used was sawdust based. It could be argued that Cat C6 was shedding virus intermittently, but C6 was housed in a group who had failed to clear virus at the 2 mg/kg dose, thus was far more likely to have been re-infected than latently infected.",

In our experience, cats either shed virus continuously or they stop shedding virus: the appearance of intermittent virus shedding could always be traced back to exposure to the faeces of an infected cat; or where virus quantity was so low that it was on the borderline of the ability of the assay to detect it, or by the presence of excessive cat litter on the sample: sodium bentonite based cat litters bind organic material.",
