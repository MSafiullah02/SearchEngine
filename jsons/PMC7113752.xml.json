            "text": "Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a feco-orally transmitted pathogen and one of the most common causes of acute hepatitis worldwide. Although the virus was already identified in 1983 (Balayan et al., 1983), many of its epidemiological and clinical features are becoming clear just recently. HEV is responsible for both acute outbreaks in developing countries and sporadic cases worldwide and is more and more being recognized as a problem in the transplant setting (Kamar et al., 2008a, Pischke et al., 2012). Although most infections are self-resolving, hepatitis E is characterized by a high mortality in pregnant women and can lead to chronic infections in immunocompromised patients. A vaccine has recently been approved for the Chinese, but not for other markets (Zhu et al., 2010). Current therapeutic options (i.e. ribavirin and interferon-\u03b1) have severe side effects and treatment failure has been reported. It may be important to have potent and safe inhibitors of HEV replication at hand to rapidly contain outbreaks and to treat immunodeficient patients.",

ORF1 encodes the non-structural proteins and contains methyltransferase, protease, macrodomain, helicase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)-encoding sequences (Koonin et al., 1992). Between the protease and the macrodomain, a hypervariable region containing a proline-rich hinge was found (Smith et al., 2012). The overlapping ORFs 2 and 3 are translated from a single subgenomic RNA into the structural proteins (Graff et al., 2006). ORF2 encodes the 660-aa capsid protein that consists of a shell domain (S), a middle domain (M, also called P1) and a protruding domain (P, also called P2) (Guu et al., 2009, Yamashita et al., 2009). The protein translated from ORF3 is 114 aa in length, is phosphorylated (Zafrullah et al., 1997) and unique to HEV and closely related viruses.",

            "text": "Although understudied, the HEV replication cycle seems typical for a single-stranded RNA virus of positive polarity (see Fig. 2\n). The virus particle first binds to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) on the host cell membrane (Kalia et al., 2009), transfers to its (unknown) cellular membrane receptor(s) and the resulting complex is internalized through clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Kapur et al., 2012). Consequently, the capped viral genome is released from the virion during the uncoating process and directly translated by the host cell ribosomal machinery. The non-structural proteins thus generated allow for the replication of the viral genome (probably in specific viral replication complexes) and the production of subgenomic RNA that is translated into the structural proteins from ORF2 and ORF3. Full-length RNA progeny is assembled with ORF2 capsid protein into viral particles of 27\u201330 nm (Balayan et al., 1983) that are consequently released from the cell in a non-lytic fashion. During release, HEV particles probably acquire a lipid bilayer (envelope) and associated ORF3 protein that are removed later by bile salts and enteric proteases respectively (Takahashi et al., 2010, Yamada et al., 2009).",

Two additional genotypes have been proposed for HEV isolates from Japanese wild boars (Smith et al., 2013). Several viruses that are more or less related to HEV have been isolated from different species, including chickens (avian HEV, Haqshenas et al., 2001), rabbits (Zhao et al., 2009), rats (Johne et al., 2010), bats (Drexler et al., 2012), ferrets (Raj et al., 2012) and trout (Batts et al., 2011) (Fig. 3\n).

It is estimated that infections with these genotypes result in 70,000 deaths annually (Rein et al., 2012). Genotypes 3 and 4 on the other hand are zoonotic agents with their main reservoir in domestic pigs (Colson et al., 2010, Li et al., 2005, Takahashi et al., 2004). Genotype 3 has a worldwide distribution, while genotype 4 is mostly found in Asia (Miyashita et al., 2012, Wang et al., 2012). However, genotype 4 has also been isolated from European pigs and patients recently (Hakze-van der Honing et al., 2011, Jeblaoui et al., 2013). Genotype 3 and 4 infections often result from consumption of undercooked pig or deer meat and may thus cause sporadic cases of hepatitis E. Although exact epidemiological data are missing, these infections seem a lot more common than initially thought (Dalton et al., 2008, Ijaz et al., 2009, Versluis et al., 2013).",

Such vaccines may be useful as a prophylactic measure in high-risk patients such as immunocompromised patients and pregnant women. This would require specific clinical trials to demonstrate protective efficacy in these populations; to the best of our knowledge, such studies have not yet been reported for Hecolin\u00ae.

            "text": "Chronic HEV infections in transplant patients can occasionally be resolved by decreasing immunosuppression, leading to spontaneous clearance in about 30% of the patients (Kamar et al., 2011). When this approach is unsuccessful and for other types of patients, there are generally 2 possibilities: the use of pegylated interferon-alpha (PEG-IFN\u03b1) or ribavirin. PEG-IFN\u03b1 has been used successfully in liver transplant, kidney transplant and leukemia patients with chronic hepatitis E (Alric et al., 2010, Haagsma et al., 2010, Kamar et al., 2010a, Kamar et al., 2010c). However, ribavirin seems to be the drug of choice in most cases with successful treatments being reported for multiple types of transplant patients (Kamar et al., 2010d, Mallet et al., 2010, Pischke et al., 2012, Pischke et al., 2013), but also for HIV and leukemia patients with chronic hepatitis E (Giordani et al., 2013, Neukam et al., 2013). Acute hepatitis E seems to respond to ribavirin treatment as well (Gerolami et al., 2011, Pischke et al., 2013). In addition, the anti-HEV activity of both drugs has been confirmed in vitro (Debing et al., 2014). Nevertheless, they need to be administered for at least 3 months and are known for their severe adverse effects. For PEG-IFN\u03b1 for instance, this includes influenza-like symptoms and neuropsychiatric side effects (Manns et al., 2006). Ribavirin on the other hand may induce severe anemia necessitating dose reductions (Kamar et al., 2010d, Pischke et al., 2012). These reductions may in turn lead to treatment failure (Pischke et al., 2013). One may deem such severe side effects acceptable in light of the severity of chronic hepatitis E (as is the case for chronic hepatitis C as well), but this is certainly not true when these drugs would be used for prophylaxis or to treat mild infections. In addition, both ribavirin and PEG-IFN\u03b1 are contra-indicated in pregnant women and other specific patient populations, leaving no available treatment options for these people. Also when considering acute infections during large outbreaks in developing countries, PEG-IFN\u03b1 is not an option due to the fact that parenteral administration is needed and the required follow-up of hematological parameters during ribavirin treatment is difficult to implement in such settings.",

This may allow decreasing the ribavirin dosage, thus reducing and hopefully avoiding anemia and other side effects. In addition, we observed a slight synergistic effect in vitro for the combination of ribavirin and interferon-\u03b1 (Debing et al., 2014), suggesting that such a combination regimen may be worth considering in the clinical setting.

The PLC/PRF/5 cells were also employed in a 3D cell culture system for HEV (Berto et al., 2013b). On the other hand, the NIH research group of Emerson derived a passage 6 virus of the Kernow-C1 strain that replicates in Huh7 and especially HepG2/C3A hepatoma cells (Shukla et al., 2011, Shukla et al., 2012). This strain is derived from a chronically infected patient and contains an inserted human ribosomal S17 RNA fragment in the hypervariable region (Shukla et al., 2011). Detailed analyses indicated that this fragment and several additional mutations contributed to the improved in vitro replication. Although the replication capacity of this strain is sufficient for virus yield assays (e.g. Debing et al., 2014), overall growth kinetics are still rather slow. No cytopathic effect (CPE) has been described for any of these HEV strains, precluding the use of standard virology techniques such as CPE reduction assays and plaque assays. In addition, genotype 1 replicates only poorly in cell culture (Nguyen et al., 2013) while it probably accounts for most of the human infections worldwide.",

We recently reported that the cutthroat trout virus (CTV) may serve as such a surrogate (Debing et al., 2013b). CTV was isolated in 1988 from spawning trout in the western USA (Hedrick et al., 1991) and recent studies revealed that the virus belongs to its own genus in the Hepeviridae family (Smith et al., 2013). It has a remarkable similarity to HEV, especially when considering the helicase and polymerase sequences (Batts et al., 2011, Debing et al., 2013b). CTV replicates readily in cell culture allowing for RT-qPCR-based virus yield assays to be performed (Debing et al., 2013b). In addition, its in vitro replication kinetics can be further improved through repeated passaging (our unpublished results). In addition, CTV is a cytopathic virus. The CPE induced in CHSE-214 cells is rather limited, but we observed that nearly complete CPE can be attained in other piscine cell lines (our unpublished results). The avian HEV has also been successfully employed as a surrogate model (e.g. Kenney et al., 2012, Pudupakam et al., 2011).",

For instance, chicken and trout can be used as experimental animal models when infected with avian HEV and CTV, respectively (Billam et al., 2005, Hedrick et al., 1994). Since both viruses are only surrogates for human HEV, further validation of experimental results would be required in another model. Genuine HEV infections can be performed in pigs (Feagins et al., 2008b, Halbur et al., 2001, Sanford et al., 2011) and non-human primates such as macaques and chimpanzees (Emerson et al., 2001, Meng et al., 1998, Purcell et al., 2003, Yu et al., 2010)., However, ethical concerns as well as practical issues may make such studies complicated. Rodents may present a more accessible model organism. For instance, laboratory rats can be experimentally infected with rat HEV, but contradicting reports have been published for the human HEV genotypes (Li et al., 2013a, Li et al., 2013b, Purcell et al., 2011, Zhu et al., 2013). Successful infection of Balb/c nude but not C57BL/6 mice with HEV was reported (Huang et al., 2009, Li et al., 2008), while rabbits can be infected with rabbit HEV and certain genotype 4 strains (Cheng et al., 2012). Finally, infection of Mongolian gerbils with genotype 4 has also been reported (Li et al., 2009). Due to the large variability between published results, a robust model that has been evaluated by multiple laboratories has not yet been reported. In addition, none of these models resulted in a lethal phenotype. For the predominant genotype 1 HEV, primates are even the only available model at this time. Promising strategies towards a robust animal model may be infection of immunedeficient rats or mice with rat HEV, discovery studies for a murine HEV species, HEV infection of mice with chimeric human or porcine livers (Meuleman et al., 2005) or establishment of transgenic mice with a human HEV receptor (when identified), as was done successfully for poliovirus (Ren et al., 1990) and HCV (Dorner et al., 2011).",

The functional HEV receptor is still unknown to date, although there are indications that genotype 1 may use a different receptor(s) than genotype 3 (Nguyen et al., 2013). It was also found that HEV attaches to HSPGs, more specifically to 6-O-sulfated syndecan-1, which may account for its liver tropism (Kalia et al., 2009). It is hypothesized that HSPGs act as a highly abundant initial attachment receptor that binds HEV with relatively low affinity. In a second step, the virion probably transfers to a high-affinity functional receptor and the resulting complex is internalized. Structure determination of a HEV-like particle combined with mutation and cell binding studies have identified a receptor binding site on top of the P2 dimer that protrudes from the 2-fold axis of symmetry (Yamashita et al., 2009). Interestingly, this site is homologous to the norovirus receptor-binding site that attaches to histo-blood group trisaccharides (Guu et al., 2009). In addition, another sialic acid-binding site was found in the P1 region of the capsid protein (Guu et al., 2009).",

            "text": "Despite the limited information that is available on HEV attachment and entry, several potentially interesting antiviral strategies can be derived from these data. First, the homology between the putative HEV and norovirus receptor-binding sites suggests that norovirus attachment inhibitors could possibly be interesting leads for further development into anti-HEV drugs. No confirmed norovirus entry inhibitors have been described to date, but two potentially interesting prototype molecules were designed through NMR binding studies (Rademacher et al., 2011) and in a similar way, citrate was found to compete with histo-blood group saccharides for norovirus binding (Hansman et al., 2012), suggesting a promising role for glycomimetics. A second and possibly overlapping approach is to search for inhibitors of HEV attachment to HSPGs. Heparan sulfate and related molecules inhibit the attachment of multiple viruses, both in vitro and in vivo (e.g. Ali et al., 2012, Bugatti et al., 2007, Lee et al., 2006). However, the clinical applicability of such molecules remains questionable and would require complete abolishment of any anticoagulative properties. Pentosan polysulfate is such an oligosaccharide derivative that is approved and marketed for pain relief in interstitial cystitis (Davis et al., 2008). Given that this drug inhibits entry of multiple viruses (Baba et al., 1988, Garc\u00eda-Villal\u00f3n and Gil-Fern\u00e1ndez, 1991), it may be worthwhile to test it as a therapeutic option for hepatitis E, although it still has some anticoagulant properties (Scully et al., 1983). Thirdly, it has been shown that a truncated ORF2 protein is capable of preventing HEV infection in vitro (He et al., 2008). Through further truncation of this protein or otherwise mimicking the receptor-binding region of HEV, it would theoretically be possible to prevent virions from binding to their cellular receptor. To illustrate the feasibility of such an approach, we refer to Myrcludex-B which is a lipopeptide derived from the HBV envelope protein and efficiently inhibits HBV entry in vitro and in vivo (Volz et al., 2013).",

Also the RdRp of RNA viruses has been targeted successfully by such molecules, consider for instance the nucleoside analogs that were developed against HCV, e.g. sofosbuvir is highly active, safe and has a high barrier to resistance. Sofosbuvir has successfully completed phase 3 clinical trials (Lawitz et al., 2013) and may receive market approval in the near future. 2\u2032-C-methylcytidine (2\u2032CMC) is a related molecule and was the first nucleoside analog that entered clinical studies for the treatment of HCV infections. It has been shown to in vitro inhibit the replication of a number of other positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses (Julander et al., 2010, Rocha-Pereira et al., 2013). However, neither 2\u2032CMC nor a number of its analogs exhibited significant activity in the transient HEV replicon assay (as described in Debing et al., 2014), unpublished results). Also only moderate antiviral activity of 2\u2032CMC was observed against CTV (Debing et al., 2013b). Despite these negative results, other nucleos(t)ide analogs may possibly be interesting inhibitors of HEV replication. Moreover, research efforts could be directed towards developing an RdRp inhibitor that targets both HEV and the distantly related alphavirus family. Such a broad-spectrum inhibitor would provide a much-needed treatment option for multiple infections by neglected viruses such as the Chikungunya virus, Sindbis virus and the equine encephalitis viruses. Elucidation of the HEV RdRp crystal structure and development of a convenient enzymatic assay would allow to jumpstart this specific domain of HEV antiviral research.",

As for the RdRp and methyltransferase, the NTPase and RNA unwinding activities of the predicted HEV helicase domain have been confirmed in vitro (Karpe and Lole, 2010b). This helicase belongs to the 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 unwinding SF-1 helicase superfamily, which also comprises the alphavirus and coronavirus (CoV) helicases. Potent inhibitors have been identified for the SARS-CoV nsP13 helicase (Adedeji et al., 2012, Tanner et al., 2005), suggesting that it may also be possible to develop inhibitors of the HEV helicase. An important caveat is that such inhibitors need to be highly specific for viral helicases without affecting host helicase activity to avoid toxicity. Examples from the herpesvirus field (helicase-primase inhibitors such as letermovir which has successfully finished phase 2 clinical studies (Marschall et al., 2012)) show that such selectivity can be attained.",

On the other hand, deubiquitination activity has been reported for the methyltransferase-protease fusion domain which may be involved in combating cellular antiviral responses (Karpe and Lole, 2011) and a recent mutational study suggested a glycine-triad as the protease substrate sequence (Parvez, 2013).

ORF3 protein is dispensable for in vitro infection of cultured cells (Emerson et al., 2006), but required for infection and seroconversion of rhesus macaques (Graff et al., 2005). A number of functions have been proposed and several binding partners have been identified (Holla et al., 2013, Ratra et al., 2008), but in general, ORF3 protein seems to optimize the host cell for HEV replication by increasing cell survival (Chandra et al., 2010, Chandra et al., 2008, Moin et al., 2007) and suppressing interferon-\u03b1 signaling (Dong et al., 2012). In addition, ORF3 protein has been implicated in virion egress (Yamada et al., 2009) and disruption of blood coagulation (Geng et al., 2013). It should be noted that most of these results have been obtained in artificial systems, i.e. overexpression of ORF3 protein in cultured cells instead of genuine infection with HEV. In order to be targeted for antiviral development, more insight into the ORF3 structure and function is required. Since the protein has multiple cellular binding partners, it may be interesting to look for inhibitors of these protein\u2013protein interactions (see also Section 7.6). Such an approach may yield very specific inhibitors of HEV replication with low toxicity and a high barrier to resistance, especially given the overlap with ORF2 which is expected to substantially limit the number of viable mutations. The feasibility of identifying protein\u2013protein interaction inhibitors as antiviral molecules was proven for the interaction between LEDGF/p75 and the HIV integrase for instance (Christ et al., 2010).",

HEV ORF3 protein has a PSAP-motif through which it associates with Tsg101, thus increasing secretion of the immunosuppressive \u03b11-microglobulin and locally suppressing the host immune response (Surjit et al., 2006). In addition, Tsg101 is required for virion release by interacting with the ORF3 protein PSAP-motif (Kenney et al., 2012, Nagashima et al., 2011a, Nagashima et al., 2011b). The involvement of Tsg101 in virion release is not limited to HEV; it was also found to be essential for HIV and Ebola virus budding (Garrus et al., 2001, Martin-Serrano et al., 2001) and is being explored as a target for antiviral therapy (Chen et al., 2010). For instance, cyclic peptides blocking the interaction between Tsg101 and the PTAP motif of the HIV Gag-protein were found to block HIV budding (Tavassoli et al., 2008). Moreover, Tsg101 is expressed on the cell membrane during both HIV and influenza virus infection and targeting by antibodies blocks virus production (Bonavia et al., 2010, Diaz et al., 2010). Similar questions can be posed for HEV: does HEV induce expression of Tsg101 at the cell membrane? Can the interaction between Tsg101 and ORF3 be blocked with a small molecule or (cyclic) peptide? Potentially, antiviral research on HEV could piggy-back on the ongoing efforts for HIV and influenza virus and thus advance rapidly.",

Similar findings have been reported for influenza virus (Haasbach et al., 2011), HIV (Schubert et al., 2000) and vaccinia virus (Satheshkumar et al., 2009). This suggests that targeting the proteasome system may be an interesting strategy for identifying broad-spectrum antiviral drugs. Proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib and carfilzomib are currently being used in the treatment of multiple myeloma, based on the increased susceptibility of cancer cells compared to non-malignant cells (Hideshima et al., 2001). However, it is unknown whether such a selectivity can also be attained for virus-infected cells versus healthy cells to avoid severe side effects.",

Hsp90 is required for intracellular trafficking of HEV particles and inhibition of hsp90 with geldanamycin blocks HEV infection (Zheng et al., 2010). Many viruses depend on hsp90 and their replication can be blocked by hsp90 inhibitors (Basha et al., 2005, Geller et al., 2013, Sun et al., 2013). Such inhibitors are currently being developed as anticancer therapies (Jhaveri and Modi, 2012 for an overview), but the question remains if sufficient selectivity can be attained for safe antiviral therapy. An alternative strategy may be to specifically inhibit the protein\u2013protein interaction between the HEV capsid and hsp90, thus leaving hsp90 enzymatic activity undisturbed.",

            "text": "Finally, there are multiple indications that HEV replication may be influenced by sex hormones. First, mortality increases dramatically in pregnant women infected with genotype 1 (up to 25%, Khuroo et al., 1981, Tsega et al., 1993). The underlying mechanism is still unclear, but it is known that low progesterone receptor mRNA levels and mutations in the progesterone receptor gene (PROGINS) are associated with poor pregnancy outcome (fulminant hepatic failure, fetal and maternal death) during HEV infection (Bose et al., 2011). On the other hand, autochthonous HEV infections in developed countries seem to primarily affect males over 50 (Dalton et al., 2011a, Davern et al., 2011, Mansuy et al., 2009). We reported that the replication of the CTV, a HEV surrogate virus, can be directly influenced by different concentrations of progesterone, testosterone and 17\u03b2-estradiol (Debing et al., 2013b), suggesting the possibility of a similar phenomenon in HEV infection. Several potential strategies can be derived from the limited information that is available. Since decreased progesterone receptor activity is associated with poor pregnancy outcome in hepatitis E (Bose et al., 2011) and high concentrations of progesterone inhibit CTV replication (Debing et al., 2013b), one may consider progesterone supplementation in pregnant women with hepatitis E. Such supplementation has been approved by the FDA for the prevention of preterm birth (Norwitz and Caughey, 2011). Similarly, testosterone levels decrease with age and low testosterone concentrations facilitate CTV replication (Debing et al., 2013b), suggesting that testosterone supplementation may be beneficial in elderly man (chronically) infected with HEV. A third possibility may be the use of selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), such as tamoxifen and raloxifene. SERMs were found to inhibit HCV replication in vitro (Murakami et al., 2013, Watashi et al., 2007) and raloxifene improved the efficacy of pegylated interferon + ribavirin in menopausal women chronically infected with HCV (Furusyo et al., 2012). It would be interesting to look into the effects of SERMs on HEV or CTV replication as they may represent another possible treatment option for hepatitis E (but not during pregnancy). To fully explore the potential treatment of hepatitis E through modulation of the hormonal system, a robust animal model displaying hormone-dependent virus replication would be much appreciated.",

HEV particles first bind to heparan sulphate proteoglycans (HSPG) and are consequently transferred to an unknown functional receptor, thus mediating cellular uptake through clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Following uncoating, the viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm and translated into non-structural proteins. These proteins form a replication complex that produces new full-length and subgenomic viral RNA. The latter is translated into capsid protein (ORF2) and the membrane associated ORF3 protein that is known to interfere with interferon-\u03b1 signaling. Viral RNA is packaged into capsid protein and released from the cell with help of the host factor Tumor susceptibility gene 101 (Tsg101). The released particles are associated with lipids and ORF3 proteins; both are consequently removed through the bile acids and digestive proteases respectively.",
