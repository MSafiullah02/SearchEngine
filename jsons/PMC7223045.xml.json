            "text": "Fasamycins and congeners are a class of rare aromatic polyketides possessing a partially reduced 1-phenyltetracene pentacyclic core. The first disclosed members of this class of natural products are the Streptomyces sp. KB-3346-5 derived naphthacemycins, including three (A\u2013C) different series of 17 compounds [1\u20133], which were originally termed as \u201cKB-3346-5 substances\u201d in a Japanese patent [3]. Fasamycins A and B were obtained by the heterologous expression of a clone derived from environmental DNA isolated from soil [4, 5]. Other congeners so far reported are all produced by Streptomyces formicae isolated from an African fungus-growing plant\u2013ant species, which include fasamycins C\u2013F, formicamycins A\u2013M [6, 7], and formicapyridines A\u2013I [7]. Most of this class of compounds, except the pyridine-containing formicapyridines, were shown to exhibit potent activity against Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) [1\u20136] and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE) [4\u20136]. Fasamycins A and B were found to inhibit the FabF enzyme associated with the biosynthesis of type II fatty acids (FASII) in bacteria [5]. This mode of action differs from those of antibiotics currently in clinical use [5]. In addition, some naphthacemycins were reported as novel inhibitors of Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) [8]. The fascinating biological profile of fasamycins and congeners has attracted organic synthetic and medicinal chemists to embark on their synthesis. The total synthesis of fasamycin A and naphthacemycin A9 have been achieved and the structure\u2013activity relationship (SAR) of the analogues were discussed [9, 10].",

Its culture extract was previously found to be active against the economically important fungal phytopathogen Peronophythora litchii and two new active alkaloids were isolated from the extract [11]. During our ongoing search for antibacterial natural products from microorganisms [12\u201316], the culture extract of this strain was found to be also active against S. aureus and MRSA. Thus, the strain SC1169 was reinvestigated by focusing on metabolites responsible for the antibacterial activity, leading to the isolation of eight new fasamycin congeners, streptovertimycins A\u2013H (1\u20138), from wheat-grown cultures. We report here the isolation, structure elucidation, and antibacterial activity of these compounds.",

The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) exhibited signals for two sets of meta-coupled aromatic protons [\u03b4H 6.46 and 6.43 (d, J = 2.4 Hz, H-2 and H-4); 6.87 and 7.12 (br s, H-24 and H-22)] indicating the presence of two tetrasubstituted aromatic rings. The spectrum also displayed signals for two isolated aromatic protons [\u03b4H 6.72 and 7.31 (s, H-16 and H-20)], two methoxys [\u03b4H 3.84 (3-OCH3) and 4.04 (15-OCH3)], three tertiary methyls [\u03b4H 1.96 (H3-25), 1.72 (H3-27), and 1.76 (H3-27)], and two hydrogen-bonded phenolic hydroxys [\u03b4H 14.34 (9-OH) and 13.50 (13-OH)]. The 13C NMR spectrum (Table 2) showed signals for 11 hydrogen-bearing carbons corresponding to the above non-exchangeable protons as indicated by the HSQC spectrum. Other 13C NMR resonances included 16 aromatic quaternary carbons, a conjugated carbonyl carbon [\u03b4C 190.2 (C-11)], and an aliphatic quaternary carbon [\u03b4C 38.8 (C-18)]. The connectivities were determined from extensive HMBC correlations (Fig. 2). H\u2013C long range correlations from H-2 to C-1 (\u03b4C 137.6), C-3 (\u03b4C 159.6), C-4 (\u03b4C 98.3), and C-6 (\u03b4C 122.5), from H-4 to C-5 (\u03b4C 152.9), C-2 (\u03b4C 107.7), C-6, and C-3, from H3-25 (\u03b4H 1.96) to C-1, C-2 and C-6, and from 3-OCH3 protons to C-3 established a 3,4-disubstituted 1-methoxy-3-methylbenzene ring (A); correlations from H-22 to C-21 (\u03b4C 141.8), C-23 (\u03b4C 157.6), C-24 (\u03b4C 121.9), and C-8 (\u03b4C 117.3) and from H-24 to C-7 (\u03b4C 137.6), C-22 (\u03b4C 110.7), C-23, and C-8 constructed a 1,2,3,5-tetrasubstituted benzene ring (B); and the H-24/C-6 correlation revealed a biaryl linkage between C-6 of ring A and C-7 of ring B. The presence of a 1,8-dihydroxy-10,10-dimethylanthracenone fused with ring B via C-8/C-21 was indicated by HMBC correlations from H-20 to C-10 (\u03b4C 107.4), C-18 (\u03b4C 38.8), C-11 (\u03b4C 190.2), C-8, and C-22, from H-16 to C-14 (\u03b4C 109.5), C-15 (\u03b4C 161.4), C-12 (\u03b4C 107.9), C-17 (\u03b4C 151.8), C-11, and C-18, from H3-26 (\u03b4H 1.72) and H3-27 (\u03b4H 1.76) to C-18, C-19, and C-17, from 9-OH to C-9 (\u03b4C 166.0), C-10, and C-8, and from 13-OH to C-13 (\u03b4C 160.0), C-12, and C-14 (Fig. 2). The additional HMBC correlation of the OCH3 protons at \u03b4H 4.04 with C-15 located the OCH3 group at C-15. The low field shifts of C-5 (\u03b4C 152.9) and C-23 (\u03b4C 157.6) and the high field shift of C-14 (\u03b4C 109.5), in combination with the molecular formula, suggested the presence of hydroxyl groups at C-5 and C-23 and the chlorine at C-14. Thus, compound 1 was characterized to be a fasamycin-type metabolite with the structure as shown in Fig. 1.",

The 1H NMR data of 2 and 3 (Tables 1 and 2) were closely similar to those of 1 except that one of two sets meta-coupled aromatic protons appeared as a proton singlet, suggesting that one of aromatic protons in ring A or B of 1 is replaced by the second chlorine in 2 and 3. Comparison of 13C NMR spectrum of 2 with that of 1 readily found that 2 contains an additional aromatic quaternary carbon [\u03b4C 113.9 (C-22)], which was assigned to the second chlorinated carbon on the basis of significantly upfield (by 4.0\u22125.0 ppm) shifts of C-20, C-21, and C-23 relative to those in 1 as well as the presence of an HMBC correlation of this carbon with the proton singlet [\u03b4H 7.10 (H-24)], which further correlated with C-8 (\u03b4C 117.9) and C-6 (\u03b4C 122.0). The second chlorinated carbon in 3 was located at C-2 (\u03b4C 114.5) as indicated by HMBC correlations of this carbon with H-4 (\u03b4H 5.52) and H3-25 (\u03b4H 2.04) together with the upfield 13C NMR shifts of C-1, C-3, C-5, and C-25 relative to those in 1 and 2 (Table 2). Thus, compounds 2 and 3 were characterized as the 22- and 2-chlorinated derivatives of streptovertimycin A, respectively. Streptovertimycin D (4) is also a dichlorinated metabolite. It has a molecular formula containing a CH2 unit less than that of 2 and 3. Its 1D NMR spectra were almost identical to those of 3 (Tables 1 and 2). Significant differences found were that the resonances for 3-OMe (\u03b4H 3.94, \u03b4C 56.3) in 3 was absent in 4 and chemical shifts of some carbons in ring A were upfield (C-2, C-3) or downfield (C-4) relative to those in 3. Accordingly, 4 was found to be a 3-O-demethylated analogue of 3.",

The configurations of 1, 3, and 6 were solved by theoretical computations of electronic circular dichroim (ECD) spectra. As can be seen in Fig. 3, the calculated ECD spectra for (S)-atropisomers of 1, 3, and 6 were all in good fit with the measured spectra, whereas the theoretical spectra of (R)-isomers were obvious mirror images of the experimental spectra, which designated these compounds as S. Other compounds (2, 4, 5, 7, and 8) were also assigned to this configuration based on the similarity of their measured ECD spectra with those of 1, 3, and 6 (Fig. 3). It is interesting that compounds 1\u22128 and the previously reported congeners of known stereochemistry [6, 7] are all (S)-atropisomers, though they are from different microbial sources.

The reference strains, MSSA, E. coli, and S. dysenteriae, were purchased from Microbial Culture Collection Center of Guangdong Institute of Microbiology (Guangzhou, China). VRE (no. 151458137) and VSE (no. 160119481), the clinical isolates from abdomen of patients, were obtained from The First Affiliate Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University. MRSA (no. 11646) was kindly provided by the State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University (Guangzhou, China). The activity was tested by microplate Alamar Blue assay (MABA) as previously described [12] with brain heart infusion medium for VRE and VSE, and Mueller-Hinton broth medium for other strains. The strains were incubated in medium on a rotary shaker at 150 rpm in 28 \u00b0C for 12 h. The bacterial suspensions of the strain were quantified with a hemocytometer and adjusted with medium to 1 \u00d7 105 CFU ml\u22121 for the MABA. Tested compounds were twofold diluted with the DMSO to give serial concentrations. One hundred microlitres of bacterial suspension of each strain containing Alamar Blue (8%, v/v) and the compound solution (4%, v/v) was added into a 96-well microtiter plate in triplicate. The final concentrations of tested compounds were 10, 5, 2.5, 1.25, 0.63, and 0.31 \u03bcg ml\u22121. Vancomycin and kanamycin were used as positive control. Negative control wells were added with DMSO instead of the test compound, and blank control wells contained Alamar Blue but without bacterial suspension. The plates were incubated in the dark at 28 \u00b0C for 6\u22128 h. The final concentration of the well, which was closest to the red one and remained blue, was deemed as the MIC.",
