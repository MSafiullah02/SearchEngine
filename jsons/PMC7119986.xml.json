            "text": "Influenza, a commonly occurring infectious disease, is caused by a capsular RNA virus. Influenza virus is an important cause of respiratory diseases among children. Young children do not have a well-formed immune system and 30 % of influenza infections occur in the first year of life. Studies also show that children younger than 2 years of age have a high rate of hospitalization attributable to influenza; the rates is comparable to that attributable to influenza among older adults (Izurieta et al. 2000; Neuzil et al. 2000). Healthy children are included in the high-risk group and should be vaccinated against influenza from the age of 6 months (Grohskopf et al. 2014). Unfortunately, the percentage of vaccinated children has been remaining at a very low level, namely 0.6\u20131.4 %, throughout many epidemic seasons. The annualized level of vaccinated children in Poland in the years 2010\u20132014, stratified by the age-groups, was as follows: 0.6\u20130.9 % in 0\u20134 years old and 1.1\u20131.5 % in 5\u201314 years old children (NIPH-NIH 2015). These low estimates are in stark contrast with the verified effectiveness of the trivalent vaccine in healthy children at the level of 59\u201365 % (Jefferson et al. 2008; Nichol 2008), which decisively points to the highly protective value of influenza vaccination in children. The objective of the present study was to examine clinical samples obtained from pediatric patients aged 0\u201314 years in one recent epidemic season in Poland to estimate the frequency and type of influenza and influenza-like infections.",

The programs are thought to represent a population sample of the country and form a basis for dealing with influenza infection in a subsequent epidemic season. Eight hundred and two clinical specimens from patients aged 0\u201314 years were tested in 16 Voivodeship Sanitary Epidemiological Stations and in the National Influenza Center of the National Institute of Public Health \u2013 National Institute of Hygiene (NIPH-NIH) in Poland. The specimens consisted of nasal swabs, throat swabs, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. The patients were stratified by age-groups into: 0\u20134 years old, 5\u20139 years old, and 10\u201314 years old.

The American Academy of Pediatrics and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommend routine influenza immunization for healthy children aged 6\u201323 months, with the aim of reducing influenza incidence and mortality of elderly people living in families along with children (Fiore et al. 2008; American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases 2004). The WHO recommends vaccination against influenza from 6 months of age. Negri et al. (2005) have shown that the average efficacy of vaccines for children aged 6 months to 16 years is 65 %. The efficacy of influenza vaccine is affected by the antigenic relationship between strains included in the vaccine and those circulating in a given epidemic season. A study conducted by Joshi et al. (2009) has shown that when there is a good antigenic match of circulating and those included in the vaccine viruses, the effectiveness of vaccination in children below 5 years of age is within 60\u201385 %. Vaccination of children signifies a reduction in treatment costs for influenza. It has been shown that the cost of treating influenza in children under 2 years of age is higher than that in children aged 2\u20135 years. The higher cost is associated with parental childcare and related absenteeism at work (Esposito et al. 2011).",
