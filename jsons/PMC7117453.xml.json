Those nucleotide or amino acid sequences may be used to differentiate Korean TGEV strains from foreign TGEV strains although more TGEV isolates need to be analyzed. Paton and Lowings (1997) reported the nucleotide sequences (250\u2013648 nucleotides) near the amino terminus of the S glycoprotein gene of several TGEV isolates, which are regions deleted in PRCV. TGEV Erica and Slagharen (Dutch isolates) had 15 nucleotide insertions between positions 496 and 497, and TGEV V63 (Belgium isolate) had 5 nucleotide insertions compared to other TGEV isolates (Paton and Lowings, 1997). And TGEV 83-3289 (English isolate) had a deletion of six nucleotides between positions 286 and 291, which is a region known to be one of two B antigenic sites (Correa et al., 1988, Gebauer et al., 1991). The additions or deletions described above were not observed in Korean TGEV isolates. Sanchez et al. (1992) reported that the protein domain including antigenic subsites Aa and Ab and site D (Gebauer et al., 1991) showed more amino acid changes than other areas of the S glycoprotein. Six Korean TGEV-specific amino acids were found in that domain. A higher number of amino acid changes in Korean and non-Korean TGEV strains were fixed in that antigenic domain because it is involved in the neutralization of virus infectivity.",

Although Korean TGEV strains except for the KT2 and 133 strains formed one cluster, several sequence differences were found among Korean TGEV strains isolated in the same year. The Korean TGEV KT2 and 133 strains formed distinct clusters that were different from other Korean TGEV strains or non-Korean TGEV or PRCV strains. Recent European TGEV isolates were quite different from earlier TGEV types because they appear to originate from a different ancestor and result from accumulation of mutations but some isolates showed genetic stability over years (Paton and Lowings, 1997). It has been suggested that reemergence of similar viruses into the field, laboratory cross-contamination, point mutations or recombination could affect the appearance of various TGEV strains (Banner and Lae, 1991, Paton and Lowings, 1997, Sanchez et al., 1999). Those mechanisms may contribute to the emergence of TGEV strains with the differences in nucleotides and amino acids in Korea.",
