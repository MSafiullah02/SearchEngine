This can help to cut off the transmission routes of COVID-19. Increases in capacity for laboratory testing, allowing treatment and isolation of COVID-19 patients also helps to reduce onwards transmission. In the period of initial success for COVID-19 control and prevention, one bottleneck has been screening out asymptomatic carriers for reducing new infections. As frontline doctors, we believe that there have been asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19 who can infect their close contacts.",

If it is not possible to screen these asymptomatic carriers from truly healthy populations, they will be a source of COVID-19 infection back into the community, which will also pose a huge challenge for COVID-19 prevention and control.",

On February 9, a man was released from prison and returned home. But he was informed to isolate himself because a prison officer was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection on February 14. In order to avoid isolation and observation, the man absconded from his home. Later, it was confirmed that this man was an asymptomatic carrier, and his brother who had close contact with him became infected with COVID-19. This case is an example of asymptomatic transmission. One study has reported that the viral load that was detected in the asymptomatic patients was similar to that in the symptomatic patients, which also theoretically suggests the potential transmission of asymptomatic patients. 5 In Conclusion, we considered that asymptomatic COVID-19 infection is possible, and person-to-person transmission can occur from asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers to the community. Therefore, vigilant control measures are warranted at this stage of the COVID-19 epidemic to avoid a resurgence in cases.",
