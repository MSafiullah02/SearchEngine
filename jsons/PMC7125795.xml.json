It is now well regarded that this process plays an important role not only in physiologic cellular homeostasis but also in a variety of diseases.",

For the discovery of this process, Christian de Duve, a Belgian scientist, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1974. The next important step in this journey was the observation that under certain conditions large cellular components and sometimes whole organelles can be found inside lysosomes. A new type of vesicle was discovered and named autophagosomes, describing a process of \u201cself-eating\u201d to understand the mechanism of how such large cargos get into the lysosome. A few years later, researchers discovered an additional system to degrade proteins, although not as large \u201cfragments\u201d but rather one by one (Fig 1\n). This system was termed the proteasome, and Aaron Ciechanover, Avram Hershko, and Irwin Rose were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2004 for the discovery of ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation (Table I\n).",

In this issue of the Journal Radonjic-Hoesli et al5 investigate a mechanism that leads to release of cytotoxic granules from eosinophils. Cytolysis is one of these mechanisms and leads to the release of intragranules, so-termed clusters of eosinophil granules. The investigators used state-of-the-art technologies, including time-lapse fluorescence microscopy, electron microscopy, and immunohistochemistry, to prove that cytoplasmic membrane disintegration and intragranule release depend on a signaling pathway, including receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 and mixed lineage kinase-like protein. Importantly, if they activate autophagy in eosinophils, this counterregulates eosinophil cytolysis. Therefore the authors not only demonstrate in a very elegant fashion a new pathway for eosinophil cytolysis, they were also able to link cytolysis with counterregulating autophagy and open new pathways for at least experimental intervention.",

Although little work has been carried out in this regard thus far, there are convincing data available linking autophagy in airway epithelium, and autophagy might be essential for bronchial epithelial mucus secretion, as has been shown in an allergic asthma model. Interestingly, autophagy, rather than endoplasmic reticulum stress, contributed to IL-13\u2013induced eotaxin-3 peptide secretion also from human airway epithelial cells.6, 7, 8 A link between the epithelial-mesenchymal transition unit and autophagy has been shown in other models of allergic asthma.9, 10 A further link between autophagy and asthma has been established for human rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, adenovirus, and influenza A virus through the role of autophagy in the defense against respiratory tract viruses, which represent a major exacerbation factor for asthma. In this regard autophagy impairs viral replication, and autophagy is enhanced in the airways of asthmatic patients.11, 12 Finally, a single nucleotide polymorphism has been discovered in the ATG5 gene, which is one of the genes regulating autophagy. This polymorphism was associated with asthma and low FEV1 levels.13\nATG5 transcripts are enhanced in nasal epithelial cells in patients with acute asthma exacerbations. This could further strengthen the functional link between autophagy and asthma (exacerbation).",
