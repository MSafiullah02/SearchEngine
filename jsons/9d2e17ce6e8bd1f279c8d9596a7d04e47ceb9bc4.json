In this study, we attempted to identify the role of E-government and COVID-19 word of mouth in terms of their direct impact on online social presence during the outbreak as well as their impacts mediated by epidemic protection and attitudes toward epidemic outbreaks. For this purpose, a unique multi-mediation model is proposed to provide a new direction for research in the field of epidemic outbreaks and their control. Through random sampling, an online survey was conducted and data from 683participants were analyzed. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was used to test the relationships between the variables of interest. The study results revealed that the roles of E-government and COVID-19 word of mouth are positively related to online social presence during the outbreak. Epidemic protection and attitude toward epidemic outbreak were found to positively moderate the impact of the role of E-government and COVID-19 word of mouth on online social presence during the outbreak. The key findings of this study have both practical and academic implications. health protection. This phenomenon encouraged us to formulate a theoretical model based on social presence theory and the role of social media to help examine safety and participation in quarantine. The conceptual model is presented in Figure 1 .",

Positive awareness through the effects of COVID-19 word of mouth (2019-nCoV-WOM) and E-Govt in the epidemic period has not been sufficiently explored. Regardless of the important roles of 2019-nCoV-WOM and E-Govt in the epidemic outbreak, quantity of research is lacking. Although online social presence is important at this time, scholars have not explored it sufficiently. From the literature, questions were raised whether online social presence increased the ability to obtain information about the safety measures and, with 24 h of free time to use social media, if people might be more willing to spread safety information. On this basis, we tried to explore the direct effect of 2019-nCoV-WOM and E-Govt on online social presence, and tried to fill this gap using a cohesive methodology to identify the mediating effect of attitude toward epidemic outbreak and epidemic protection on online social presence. We used five constructs (2019-nCoV-WOM, role of E-Govt, attitude toward epidemic outbreak, epidemic protection, and online social presence in the outbreak) with a conceptual multi-mediation model. We explored a distinctive approach to answer two questions: Is there any mediating effect of attitude toward epidemic outbreak and epidemic protection on online social presence? What is the best possible combination for the government to increase people's willingness to participate in quarantine with a psychological perspective?",

We also tried to critically evaluate the role of social media and the willingness to undergo a long quarantine period for protection from this epidemic. Here, per the literature, we take this variable of people's perception (perceived role) of the role of the Chinese government, which was important because the government provided a plan to withstand the outbreak period. Notably, this is the first critical review of the use of 2019-nCoV-WOM and the role of E-Govt in the COVID-19 epidemic (as independent variables).",

To check the importance of the structural path coefficients, we report the confidence interval [86] . These were supported because we did not add up zero values in any confidence interval [78] .At present, in standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) PLS path modeling, mostly model fit criteria are used. We checked the accuracy of the fit by using different tools like value of normed fit index (NFI), the non-normed fit index (NNFI), the comparative fit index (CFI), root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), and SRMR. Values equal to or higher than 0.95 in NFI, NNFI, and CFI indicate the best fit. Sufficient adjustment was represented by RMSEA and To check the importance of the structural path coefficients, we report the confidence interval [86] .

For comparatively good fit between the hypothesized model and observed data, a cut-off value near to 0.08 for SRMR and near 0.06 is best for RMSEA; Hu, L.T. et al. [88] stated that a zero value for SRMR indicates an ideal fit but if the value is smaller than 0.05,the fit is satisfactory fit [89] . We investigated the standards of the coefficient of determination (R 2 ) to verify the predictive strength of our structure model. Collective consequences of exogenous contracts on endogenous constructs were indicated. The R 2 of the endogenous latent variables is the vital decisive factor for this evaluation. This marker is used, from the perspective of a statistical model, to forecast future results or can be used to check the hypothesis on behalf of other related information. R 2 also provides the results of the calculations and describes the practicality of the results [90] . Researchers can also use PLS procedure to check their model's out-of-sample predictive power [91] . In-sample predictive power, we also refer to the R 2 [92] . R 2 varies from 0 to 1 and greater values show better descriptive power. Substantial, moderate, and weak descriptive powers are indicated by R 2 values of 0.75, 0.50, and 0.25, respectively [93] .

If the cross-validated redundancy (Q 2 ) is higher than 0,then the model is related to predicting that factor [95] . We focused on in-sample prediction more, compared to out-sample prediction, prognostic significance Q 2 , and relative relevance Q 2 , which are alternatives for evaluating a model's practical relevance, in addition to consulting R 2 outcomes as a gauge of a model's predictive capabilities [95] . R 2 , Q 2 , path coefficients, and the effect size (f 2 ) are the decisive factors we use for evaluation. In addition to this evaluation, researchers are required to check the inner model for potential co linearity issues. If the constructs are interrelated, then results approximated by the inner model are considered biased [96] . A model's predictive accuracy is decided by the R 2 . The R 2 value also characterizes the combined consequence of exogenous variables on the endogenous variable(s). The effect ranges from 0 to 1. A value of 1 indicates complete predictive accuracy as can see in Table 6 . Table 6 . Effect size and predictive relevance. Cohen's f 2 was calculated to check the effect size of each path model. When a construct was removed from the model, we calculated f 2 while making no changes to R 2 . Researchers have to approximate two PLS path models for computing f 2 . The effect size of the omitted construct for a particular endogenous construct can be found by standard values: 0.02 for small, 0.15 for medium, and 0.35 for a large effect on the basis of the f 2 value [96] .",

Though researchers use an older method to determine the mediation effect in PLS-SEM, the procedure that identifies the effect of a precursor variable on the findings and results is judged by mediation; in other words, mediation considers transitional variables [97] . A mediating variable may have a transitional role in the association between dependent and independent variables, and engagement of this third variable is the important feature of the mediating effect [98] . Clarification and elaboration are the main effects of mediation [81] . As such, we included multi-mediation concepts in the results of social presence theory and for psychological aspects during outbreaks (see Table 7 ). Table 7 . Mediation analysis. Table 7 .

If VAF is less than 0.2, there is no mediation; if VAF is less than or equal to 0.8, there is a partial mediation; if VAF is greater than 0.8, there is full mediation. The magnitude and strength of epidemic protection (H4b: a1b1) and attitude toward epidemic outbreak (H5b: a2b2) mediated the association between the role of E-Govt and online social presence ( Figure 5 ). We found via comparison that epidemic protection has a partial mediation effect on the role of E-Govt and online social presence because the VAF value was more than 0.2, which indicated that there is a partial mediation effect. As such, H4b is supported. Attitude toward epidemic outbreaks mediated the association between 2019-nCoV-WOM and online social presence; the VAF value was greater than 0.2, which indicated the presence of mediation. Therefore, we hypothesized imaginary harmonizing partial mediation because the effects of 2019-nCoV-WOMwere considerable both directly and indirectly and their products were positive [99] .",

We constructed eight hypotheses for the direct effects (H1a, H1b,H1c,H2a,H2b,H2c,H3a, and H3b) and four hypothesis (H4b,H5b,H3c, and H4c) for the mediation effect of our dual mediators, i.e., epidemic protection and attitude toward epidemic outbreak, with their indirect effect between the role of E-Govt and2019-nCoV-WOM on online social presence during outbreaks. Our results are supported by Mmijail et al. [101] who concluded that local government affects the attitude and decision-making process of people with their e-government platforms. The results of our study showed that role of E-Govt have a strong effect on the attitude of the public toward quarantine. Our study results also showed that public relationship directly influences positive WOM. Our study results are supported by Kim et al., who concluded that local government affects the social presence of community participants and the identified individuals' attitudes and community [102] . Our study results revealed that attitude toward epidemic outbreak has a strong mediation effect between the role of E-Govt and online social presence during outbreaks, indicating that other governments and organizations can follow China's safety model. The Chinese government allowed full opportunity to be online and for online users to promote hand washing and mask wearing during the COVID-19 outbreak.",

We used two sampling techniques: random sampling and snowball sampling; future research can be improved using different kind of sampling and data collection techniques. The second major limitation was the use of single type of role of E-Govt. The reason behind this limitation was the ongoing quarantine, so it was impossible to compare the relationship of 2019-nCoV-WOM in online social presence with offline discussion because personal meetings, face-to-face contact, physical interviews, etc. were prohibited. However, future research can be improved using different types of research variables, using web scraping and web mining of top trends complete protection analyses. However, our findings can be implemented to improve online social presence and increase emotive protection during epidemic quarantine periods. Fourth, the data were collected online. Therefore, we were unable to gauge the respondents' responses during data collection, although people were very motivated to share their answers to the questionnaire because of the involvement of the role of the government. More adequate research can be conducted by expanding the study area, e.g., people from other countries. Our study was limited to two provinces because as of6 March, 2020, these two provinces were still under quarantine. The study could also be further improved by focusing on recovered patients and comparing different countries affected by COVID-19 using the proposed research model. Further research on special issues is highly encouraged in other countries that have different isolation facilities, e.g., free internet, quiz competitions for children, etc., on the basis of the theoretical background, web scraping, and trends.",
