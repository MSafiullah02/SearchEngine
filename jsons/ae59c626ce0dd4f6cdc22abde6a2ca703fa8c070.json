It is also the critical determinant of viral host range and tissue tropism and is a major inducer of host immune response (Li, 2016) . Spike protein is in charge of receptor binding and subsequent viral entry into the host cells. Therefore, it can be the major therapeutic target. It binds to the cellular receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and cellular receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP 4) or CD 26. The former is more for SARS and the latter is for MERS. CD 209 L is the alternative receptor with lower affinity to respiratory tract (Song et al., 2019) .",

Spike protein-based vaccine will also produce antibodies and will offer protection. Passive antibody transfer from convalescent sera of recovered patients will have polyclonal antibodies, and their plasma can be transfused. A new idea of target viral receptor protein on cell surface ACE2 and RBD protein can be attached to an Fc fragment and can be used to attack the virus. Extracellular domain of ACE2 protein fused to a human immunoglobulin G, Fc domain may hold promise (David Fedson, 2016) . ACE2 Fc fusion protein against COVID may neutralize the virus and prevent lung injury. It can also be used to give passive immunity to health care workers. All these are still highly experimental. An interesting paper (Hoffmann et al., 2020) Chloroquine is being tried too. 4 We also hypothesize that the use of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) available for clinical use as antihypertensives can be potential drugs to be given for control of viral spread of novel coronavirus (Wuhan) infection. An unpublished observation by one of us (M.P.) is that people using losartan or telmisartan (ARB) as antihypertensives get fewer attacks of cold and flu-like illnesses. Both these drugs also do not produce cough as the side effect so commonly seen with ACE inhibitors. Losartan and telmisartan strongly binds to the AT1 receptors more than valsartan (Phadke & Saunik, 2020) . Therefore, the use of the former could be suitable in The use of zinc supplement can help intracellular killing and phagocytosis, and can modulate immune function, and may be tried. Thus, the use of ARB (telmisartan and losartan) to be given in therapeutic doses along with zinc to control viral replication warrants attention. ACE2 receptors are widely expressed on epithelial cells of alveoli, trancheobronchial free and may help virus entry (Song et al., 2019) . Therefore, the use of ARBs in the form of nebulization can be tried.",

A large body of experimental and clinical research done on treating patients with pneumonia, ARDS, sepsis, influenza, and Ebola (with lung injury) suggest that statins and angiotensin receptor blockers might be effective in COVID-19 infection. Statins are known to have lipid-lowering and also anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities on cytokines, chemokines, complement cascade, and coagulation factors. Thus, the host response to COVID-19 resulting in lung injury may be controlled with the use of statins. Hypercytokinemia is not directly associated with viral replication, but it can be variability in host response. Early use of statins could prove beneficial. Other anti-inflammatory drugs can be used.",
