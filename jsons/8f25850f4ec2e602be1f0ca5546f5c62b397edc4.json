Authorities and physicians are still learning how COVID-19 affects people with underlying diseases, and severe asthma is not an exception. Unless relevant data emerges that changes our understanding of the relative safety of medications indicated in patients with asthma during this pandemic, clinicians must follow the recommendations of current evidence-based guidelines, preventing loss of control and exacerbations. Also, with the absence of data that would indicate any potential harm, current advice is to continue the administration of biologic agents during the COVID-19 pandemic in patients with asthma for whom such agents are clearly indicated and have been effective. For the patients with severe asthma infected by SARS-CoV-2, the decision to maintain or postpone biologic therapy until the patient recovers should be a case-by-case based decision supported by a multidisciplinary team. A registry of cases of COVID-19 in patients with severe asthma, including those treated with biologics, will help to address a clinical challenge where we have more questions than answers. ",

The primary unknown question is whether eosinophils could be mechanistically important in COVID-19 infection.

It was believed that low eosinophil counts in peripheral blood would be related to the infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus itself, and not necessarily an indicator that treatments which reduce eosinophil counts in patients with asthma would be associated with more severe COVID-19 disease. Interestingly, more recent studies from China and from Italy do not further report eosinopenia in patients with severe COVID-19 (3, 27, 28) . Of note, in a small phase 2 trial, patients with PDGFRA-negative hypereosinophilic syndrome, presenting with mean eosinophil counts of over 2,300/mm3 at baseline, had a marked decrease in both peripheral blood and tissue eosinophils 12 weeks after receiving benralizumab (29) .",

Those suggestions were: \"to not cease or modify any asthma medication administration due to any concerns about COVID-19; there is a risk that doing so could hinder your asthma control; anti-IL5 should not increase the risk of getting COVID-19, and continuing its intake could theoretically reduce the risk of an asthma attack in case you were to contract the virus\" (40).Several national societies, such as the British Thoracic Society (BTS) and the Italian Society of Allergy, Asthma & Clinical Immunology (SIAAIC), recommend continuing the biologic treatment and highlight the need for transition efforts (from the clinic to home care).
