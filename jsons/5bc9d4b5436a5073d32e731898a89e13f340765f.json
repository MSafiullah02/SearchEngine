As of April 2016, there were 28,652 cases resulting in at least 11,325 deaths, nearly all in the three nations of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone [1] . Moreover, the 2014-2016 outbreak was the first in which patients, albeit few in number, were afforded sophisticated intensive care in the United States and in Europe. This \"high-level containment care\" (HLCC) was provided in specially designed purpose-built biocontainment units (BCUs). In this chapter, we explore the history and evolution of biocontainment, discuss its unique engineering and infection control modalities, and offer recommendations for the clinical and operational management of Ebola and other viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs).",

In May of that year, Michael Crichton published The Andromeda Strain, and, while the work was clearly fictional, it debuted amidst a series of discussions leading up to President Nixon's decision in November of that year to abandon the US offensive biological weapons program. Nixon's decision was a prelude to ratification of the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention and to the US ratification, in 1975, of the Geneva Protocols. At the time, Nixon stated that \"the United States has decided to destroy its entire stockpile of biological agents and confine its future biological research program to defensive measures.\" Implicit in that decision was a shift in the focus of US efforts to defensive and medical countermeasure development that would include an emphasis on the management of patients potentially infected with highly hazardous human pathogens. This medical defense program would fall largely upon the newly created US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), an entity which would inherit its defensive mission from the old Army Biological Laboratory (ABL).",

Inclusion of laboratory and waste sterilization capabilities within HLCC units are also key features that help minimize the potential of transmission throughout the hospital [16, 17] . A double door pass through autoclave was identified as mandatory for HLCC unit through both consensus efforts [7, 18] . Analogous pass through \"dunk tanks\" filled with disinfectant solution is useful in moving specimens from the HLCC to the laboratory and is particularly useful in facilities which lack a dedicated \"in-unit\" laboratory.

The number of staff members required for a standard 12 h nursing shift must take into account the time limitations imposed on each staff member due to the use of advanced PPE. When providing the level of intensive care that these patients can require in addition to wearing PPE, it is necessary to adjust shift times and staffing ratios [24] . The staffing matrix utilized within hospitals that successfully cared for EVD patients differed significantly from standard staffing ratios. Within the Nebraska Biocontainment Unit, six staff members were present on a day shift and five on the night shift (usually three nurses along with respiratory therapists and/or patient care technicians). Healthcare staff was scheduled for 12 h shifts which were broken up into 4 h blocks to allow for the limitation of not wearing PPE for greater than 3-4 h at a time. Designation of roles for each staff member on each shift can clarify expectations and ensure consistency within each role. The use of an autoclave for waste processing may necessitate the inclusion of a dedicated staff member to operate the machine. The Special Communicable Diseases Unit (SCDU) at Emory University utilized two to three nurses to staff the Unit at all times when occupied, and it was recommended that nurses remove (\"doff\") PPE every 4 h to allow for personal needs and a break. At the highest level of PPE and patient care, three nurses were working in the SCDU at one time, in 12-h shifts. They rotated in 4-h shifts between the patient room, the anteroom, and the nursing desk with each having designated responsibilities [20] .",

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requires that employers protect their employees from workplace hazards that might cause injury. Controlling a hazard at its source is the best way to protect employees. Depending on the hazard or workplace conditions, OSHA recommends the use of engineering or work practice controls to manage or eliminate hazards to the greatest extent possible [29] . Installing negative pressure air handlers to place a barrier between the hazard and the employees is an engineering con-trol; changing the way in which employees perform their work is a work practice control.

Varying levels of PPE are appropriate for use based upon the acuity of the patient, the volume of infectious bodily fluids (blood, vomitus, diarrheal stool) present, and the potential for aerosolization of these fluids [31] . Providing this level of protection often requires that many pieces of PPE be worn; this can lead to an increased risk of fatigue and overheating.",

While PPE is effective at decreasing exposure to infected bodily fluids among healthcare workers, these healthcare workers are still at risk if this equipment is not removed in a manner that prevents exposure [32] . Detailed guidance with the correct order of donning and doffing equipment should be readily visible on a chart posted within the patient care area. The process used to don and doff PPE should be followed exactly by all personnel every time it is performed and should be guided by a checklist. All staff members, regardless of title or position, are expected to hold one another accountable for adhering to the policies and procedures, including the appropriate use of PPE [22, 33, 34] . The donning and doffing process should incorporate the use of a donning partner who assists the healthcare worker in appropriate placement of PPE and a doffing partner who assists the healthcare worker in removing their PPE. This doffing partner helps to ensure that all steps in the process are completed in the proper order and technique. The physical exhaustion and emotional fatigue that can accompany the provision of care for patients infected with VHF may further increase the chance of an inadvertent exposure to bodily fluids on the outside of the PPE when performing the doffing process [32] . The CDC also recommends the presence of a trained observer when performing the doffing process [30] . The trained observer is available to provide immediate feedback if there is any inadvertent contamination of the healthcare worker. The doffing process can be complex and is considered to be a vulnerable area in which the healthcare providers may be inadvertently contaminated. Simulation studies conducted using donning and doffing scenarios have shown high rates of self-contamination during the doffing process, especially during the removal of the gown and gloves, emphasizing the need for stringent protocols and supervision during this process [28] .",

Adequate staffing during the care of the deceased is essential for safe execution of the procedures. The patient remains are first prepared and packaged within the patient room (hot zone) and transferred out into the hallway or anteroom (warm zone) and out of the patient care area (cold zone) for transport to final disposition [65] . The body of the deceased should not be washed or embalmed, medical devices should remain in place, and healthcare workers should not attempt to remove them. Autopsies should not be performed unless specifically directed by the state health department and only after consultation with the CDC and state health department officials [63] . Patient remains should be securely contained within the patient care area. The remains should be packaged using established guidance, which currently includes the use of multiple layers [63] . The first layer to form a protective barrier is a standard hospital issued mortuary bag, followed by a heat sealable chlorine-free material, and final securement is achieved by the use of a heavy duty morgue bag. Each protective barrier that is added should be thoroughly disinfected before moving to the next step and again before being transported out of the hot zone.

Providing routine training for key personnel ensures the opportunity for healthcare workers to gain confidence in their ability to perform the procedures, as well as to build a firm foundation of processes for many aspects of care [22] . Developing and exercising detailed policies to guide cares within the unit, as well as maintaining an expert staff, are key components to maintaining preparedness.",

This could include inserting an intravenous device, assisting with perineal care after an incontinent episode, processing waste in the patient care area, or charting an assessment. Training should be customized for the intended audience and effectively relay essential information.

Under this system, facilities with high-level containment care capability are designated as \"Ebola Treatment Centers\" (ETC). As of this writing, approximately 55 such centers have applied for designation and funding; among them are ten designated as regional referral centers by DHHS (one in each of its ten geographic regions) [81] . In addition, other hospitals would be designated as \"Ebola Assessment Hospitals\" (EAH), able to manage and isolate persons under investigation (PUI) until a diagnosis of Ebola virus disease (EVD) can be confirmed or refuted. Finally, remaining hospitals (\"Frontline Facilities\") would receive training in order to improve their ability to isolate potential Ebola victims until they could be transferred to an EAH or ETC. Within this network, the provision of patient care can be optimized, protocols practiced and improved, and research on investigational drugs and products streamlined. Although this system represents a vast improvement in hospital preparedness in the United States, isolation bed capacity remains limited [82] .",
