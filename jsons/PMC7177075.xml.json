Communities are facing unprecedented times and today, young people are among those being asked to make significant sacrifices in order to protect the health of older adults and other vulnerable populations. As we are writing this commentary, almost two million people around the world have received confirmed diagnoses of COVID-19 and over 125,000 have died from complications related to the virus. Initial data from China indicated that youth and young adults were less likely to be infected and were less likely to become seriously ill. As the disease has spread globally, this remains true, and today in the United States the CDC estimates that while youth under the age of 18 comprise 22% of the US population, they represent only 1.7% of current COVID-19 cases.1 Even though adolescents and young adults are least likely to be severely affected if they contract COVID-19, drastic measures are being taken that affect large populations of youth to slow the rate of infection. Young people adapt daily as schools, colleges, movie theaters, restaurants, and bars close; sports games, music concerts, dance recitals, graduations, and proms are cancelled; and shelter-in-place orders are becoming a way of life. These public health measures are critically important to protect individuals\u2019 health, reduce the burden on our healthcare system, and limit the number of people whose lives are cut short by COVID-19. At the same time, questions have emerged about whether costs to young people associated with the aggressive disease prevention measures such as school closures, are significant contributors to combating viral transmission. 2 Further, it is unclear whether any of these decisions have included youth voice and participation.",

We live in an interconnected world. Adolescent health and well-being are significantly impacted by social, political, economic, environmental, and structural factors.6 While efforts to prevent further COVID-19 transmission will result in short-term benefits, they also threaten economic stability of families; increase food and housing insecurity; disrupt educational attainment; decrease exercise and physical activity; increase mental health issues; and will likely have lasting effects on adolescent development. As young people across the globe are stepping up to protect the vulnerable in unprecedented ways, they have the right to be involved in these decisions that are impacting their lives.",

The Youth Involvement subcommittee of the Program Committee, which includes undergraduate students and young professionals, has led efforts to ensure that presentations that include youth presenters receive priority during the conference and youth engagement is meaningfully structured in the professional development of SAHM members. Thirty-two adolescents and young adults (aged 14y -23y), from three U.S. states, participated in the SAHM Youth Involvement subcommittee activities during 2019-2020. When the 2020 SAHM Conference was canceled due to COVID-19, fourteen members from this group of youth shared how this unusual time has personally impacted them. Through an informal, electronic survey, they described feeling helpless to protect loved ones; experiencing challenges maintaining friendships remotely; missing out on academic and extracurricular celebrations and milestones; and coping with school closures, transitions to distant learning, and the displacement from the school campus-settings. Collectively, these feelings affect their overall health and well-being. When asked what mattered most after the outbreak has been reduced, the singular response from these youth can be surmised in one quote, \u201cIf possible, getting back all/or most of my missed opportunities.\u201d While we can never turn back the clock for these youth, we view this as a challenge for SAHM and other youth-serving organizations as we look to the uncertain and unpredictable future.",
