The number of cases rapidly rose. COVID-19 has spread globally within 60 days with focus areas in Asia, Europe and the Middle East [2]. Epidemiological data indicate that human-to-human transmission is occurring [3,4]. As of March 1, 2020, 130 confirmed COVID-19 cases had been reported in France with three deaths [5]. In this context, rapid virological diagnosis is valuable to reduce the duration of isolation for suspected cases and to reduce fear among individuals who have potentially ben in contact with them. It also allows for optimal management of any COVID-19 cases that are diagnosed. We aim to share our initial experiences in managing patients suspected of having COVID-19 through a rapid ambulatory care circuit and virological diagnosis in our infectious disease reference hospital in Marseille, France.",

For the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA we used two different RT-PCR systems with a hydrolysis probe and the LightCycler Multiplex RNA Virus Master kit (Roche Diagnostics\u00ae, Mannheim, Germany). The first system targets the envelope protein (E)-encoding gene and was previously described [7] and uses a synthetic RNA positive control (supplied by the Charit\u00e9 virology institute - Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany [8]). The second system was designed in-house, targets the spike protein-encoding gene (forward primer: 5\u2032-AAACTTGTGCCCTTTTGGTG-3'; reverse primer: 5\u2032-TGCTGATTCTCTTCCTGTTCC-3'; probe: 5\u2032-CGCCACCAGATTTGCATCTG-3\u2032), and uses a synthetic RNA positive control ordered from Eurogentec\u00ae (Seraing, Belgium). In some cases, a real-time RT-PCR was carried out with the QuantiNova SYBR Green RT-PCR kit (Qiagen\u00ae) that targeted either the E gene with the same primers as above or previously described primers targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)-encoding gene [7] with a synthetic RNA positive control (Eurogentec). A phage RNA internal control [9] was added to each clinical sample before extraction to ensure RNA extraction and PCR amplification were accurate. All experiments were performed on a LightCycler 480 instrument (Roche Diagnostics) by trained qualified technicians available who were available around the clock, either during routine working days and hours, or on an on-call basis. Concurrently, a multiplex molecular assay that detects respiratory pathogens was performed at the point-of-care laboratory [10] with the Biofire FilmArray Respiratory panel 2 test (Biom\u00e9rieux, Marcy-l'Etoile, France) or the FTD Respiratory pathogens 21 kit (Fast Track Diagnosis, Luxembourg).",

Thereafter, results continued to be available in approximately 3 h. A viral diagnosis was obtained in 137/280 patients (48.9%) (Table 2\n). The most frequent viruses were influenza A virus (12.1% of all patients), rhinovirus (11.8%), influenza B virus (7.9%) and metapneumovirus (7.1%). Common coronaviruses (E229, OC43, NL63 and HKU1) were detected in 12.9% of patients. Twelve (4.3%) patients had viral co-infections (Table 2). Patterns of viral infection slightly differed between patients returning from Italy and those returning from China. Notably, patients returning from Italy were more likely to be infected with influenza B virus, metapneumovirus and coronavirus HKU1 compared to those returning from Asia (Fig. 3\n). By contrast, patients returning from Asia were more likely to be infected with rhinovirus/enterovirus and respiratory syncytial virus.",

            "text": "Because COVID-19 infection symptoms range from unspecific mild respiratory symptoms to acute respiratory distress [3] and because these symptoms are very similar to those of many seasonal viruses [[11], [12], [13]], we implemented an outpatient rapid diagnosis for mildly affected patients which operated 10 h a day, seven days a week. This involved testing a broad spectrum of clinical presentations in potentially exposed persons [14]. As in Italy, an infectious diseases clinician was key to patient triage [15]. The genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 enabled the rapid design and implementation of dedicated point-of-care real-time RT-PCR diagnostic tests [16] in addition to other respiratory pathogens testing. The Mediterranean Infection University Hospital Institute is one of the nine French metropolitan hospital centres habilitated by the French Ministry of Health (MoH) to manage highly contagious patients. These centres were designated by the MoH to test patients suspected of COVID-19 at the early start of the epidemic (corresponding to the present study). Among these nine hospitals, our institute is the only one organized to manage large populations of out-patients in a dedicated isolated area, under negative pressure with laboratory facilities on site. The number of French centres designated for testing was then extended to 33 hospitals [5]. Finally, on March 6th, 2020, the French MoH authorized private medical laboratories to perform nasopharyngeal sampling and testing for SARS-CoV-2. In France, such laboratories are managed by medical doctors or pharmacists. The clinical features of our 255 outpatients were compatible with the COVID-19 prodromal phase, as previously reported [3,17]. Similar to an earlier study of suspected cases of MERS-CoV [18], no cases of SARS-CoV-2 was detected, whereas other common viral pathogens were detected in 49% of the patients. Our results in patients returning from Italy corroborate those of an Italian study conducted among 126 patients between 21 January and February 7, 2020 with regards to the predominance of influenza viruses among positive samples followed by rhinovirus [11]. Timely identification of influenza virus infections allows for early treatment with antiviral therapy. Respiratory virus acquisition following travel is common. In previous studies conducted in pilgrims returning from the Grand Mahal (Senegal) or from the Hajj (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia) acquisition of rhinovirus and common coronaviruses was frequently observed [19,20]. In addition, we revealed evidence that metapneumovirus accounted also for a significant proportion of positive cases and found a higher proportion of common coronaviruses, notably HKU1 and NL63. This high proportion of common coronaviruses reflects the circulation of these viruses in the community, which are mainly responsible for mild upper respiratory tracts infections [21]. Interestingly, we found several seasonal coronaviruses co-infections with influenza A or B viruses and with rhino/enteroviruses. Although such results cannot be extrapolated to SARS-CoV-2, this is indeed a question in healthcare setting where SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis is not available, whether the diagnosis of influenza can rule out the diagnosis of COVID-19. No cross-reaction between common coronaviruses or other common viruses and SARS-CoV-2 has been yet described, to our knowledge and the role of viral co-infections in the disease severity is still unknown. SARS CoV and metapneumovirus co-infections were documented in 2003 but did not correlate with disease severity [22].",
