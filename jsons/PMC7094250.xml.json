The lung compliance and airway resistance respond in a realistic manner to relevant respiratory challenges. In addition, the HPS produces an airflow pattern that is close to the in vivo situation and has been applied in previous studies to simulate human respiration.20, 21, 22, 23\n",

During examination of exhaled air dispersion from the total facemask, NIV was applied using a bilevel positive airway pressure device (ResMed VPAP III ST). The IPAP was initially set at 10 cm H2O and gradually increased to 14 and then 18 cm H2O, whereas the EPAP was maintained at 5 cm H2O throughout the study.12, 13 The EPAP was higher for the helmets than the total face mask, as higher pressure was required to prevent CO2 rebreathing in the helmets to overcome the larger anatomic dead space.",

It mixed with alveolar gas and then exhaled through the airway. Sections through the leakage jet plume were then revealed by a thin laser light-sheet (Green, 532 nm wavelength, continuous-wave mode) created by a diode-pumped solid state laser (OEM UGH-800 mW, Lambdapro Technologies Ltd), with custom cylindrical optics for two-dimensional laser light-sheet generation.12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17\n",

The HPS represented a 70-kg adult man sitting on a 45\u00b0-inclined hospital bed and was programmed to mimic normal breathing, mild lung injury, and severe lung injury. Exhaled air, marked by the smoke particles, is illuminated by the laser light-sheet, with dispersion through the neck interface of the Sea-Long helmet (A) and through the exhalation port of the total face mask attached to the HPS (C).
