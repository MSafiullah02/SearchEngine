Danishefsky et al. demonstrated the simple stepwise glycosidation via ring-opening nucleophilic addition of alcohol to the epoxide 3.11 Several processes concerning protection\u2013deprotection can be shortened using 3 because the nucleophilic addition to 3 accompanies with the generation of a free secondary alcohol. However, the applications of 3 to graft polymerization techniques were difficult due to the high unstability of 3.",

Sulfite 4 was the \u03b1-anomer and an endo/exo-mixture on the sulfur atom,12, 16 which was used for the next studies without separation. While 4 was sufficiently stable for purification on a florisil column chromatography, epoxide 3 decomposed easily under the same purification condition. To evaluate the difference of chemical stability between 3 and 4, each solution of 3 and 4 in CDCl3 was kept at arbitrary temperatures (20, 40, and 60 \u00b0C) and analyzed by 1H NMR measurements.17, 18 Assuming that the degradation reactions obey first-order kinetics, the rate constants were determined from the time vs. ln([3 or 4]/[3 or 4]0) plots using the integral ratios from the 1H NMR spectra. As a result, it was found that 4 survived for longer time than 3 at all temperatures. The half-lives (\u03c4) of 3 and 4 were also calculated by the equation; \u03c4\n = ln2/k. The activation energy (\u0394E) was obtained by the Arrhenius plots and the activation enthalpy (\u0394H\u2021) and activation entropy (\u0394S\u2021) were obtained by the Eyring plots.17 The kinetic and thermodynamic parameters for the degradations are summarized in Table 1\n. The degradation half-lives of 4 were approximately 3\u20136 times greater than those of 3, leading to the higher \u0394E for the degradation of 4 than that of 3. It also turned out that the enthalpy term (\u0394H\u2021) was dominant rather than the entropy term (T\u0394S\u2021).",

Initiator 5 was prepared from commercially available glycyrrhetic acid via benzyl protection of carboxylic acid. The grafting polymerization of 4 from 5 were performed in CH2Cl2 in the presence of TfOH and molecular sieves 3\u00c5 (MS 3A) at room temperature. The results are summarized in Table 2\n. The conversion of 4, the polymerization degree, and the number average molecular weight (M\nn) were determined by the 1H NMR analyses of crude mixture. The conversion of 5 and the polydispersity index (M\nw/M\nn) were estimated by a size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using THF on the basis of polystyrene standards. At first, we used the stoichiometric amount of both 5 and TfOH to that of 4. Contrary to our expectation that the reaction would mainly give the monosaccharide-containing glycoside, the conversion of 5 was middle (45.8%) and that of 4 was quantitative (entry 1, Table 1). The average polymerization degree was 2.9, indicating that M\nn of Poly-6 is 1,800 Da. The M\nw/M\nn of Poly-6 was a relatively narrow value (1.1). Such results indicate that the bulky alcohol of 5 as a neopentyl alcohol would slowly initiate the glycosylation reaction of 4 along with the elimination of SO2 to generate a free alcohol at the 2 position of the sugar. The resultant secondary alcohol could exhibit a higher reactivity than the neopentyl alcohol of 5, which would facilitate further nucleophilic addition to the other cyclic sulfite 4, leading to the ring-opening polycondensation of 4 initiated by 5. It is noted that the polymer with a narrow M\nw/M\nn was obtained, even when the excess amount of 5 was used (entry 2).",

With the decrease in the feed ratio of 5 against 4, the conversion of 4 decreased whereas that of 5 increased (entries 3\u20135), which afforded the similar M\nn values. The decreased amount of TfOH prolonged the reaction time, probably because the reaction rate would be strongly dependent on the concentration of acid. On the other hand, when the amount of MS 3A was decreased to 25 wt % (entry 6), the conversion of 4 was dramatically improved, resulting in the formation of the polymer with higher M\nn. In the cases of entries 7 and 8 with 5 mol % of TfOH, the reduced amount of MS 3A (12.5 wt %) also enabled the high conversion of 4 to give the higher-molecular-weight polymer. Such results suggest that M\nn of Poly-6 was moderately controllable by the change of feed ratio. The use of MS 3A as a dehydrator might reduce the effective concentration of acid.",

In the IR spectrum, the absence of the characteristic signal of sulfite at around 1200 cm\u22121 was observed,17 suggesting that the polymerization of 4 efficiently eliminates SO2 to form (1 \u2192 2)-linked oligosaccharide skeletons. The presence of enone absorption band at around 1660 cm\u22121 was also confirmed. In the 1H NMR spectrum (Fig. S13), the signals attributed to glycyrrhetic acid and oligosaccharides appeared along with the disappearance of the protons of 4,17 supporting the efficient conversion of 4. The chemical shift of olefinic proton signal of the polymer almost agreed with that of 5, also supporting the retention of the enone moiety after the polymerization.

The \u03b2/\u03b1-stereo-ratio on the anomeric centers was roughly estimated to be 14.5:1 by the integral ratio between the carbon signals at 110\u2013100 ppm for a \u03b2 carbon and those at 100\u201390 ppm for an \u03b1 carbon, considering the reported chemical shifts of natural product and synthetic derivatives.2, 8 The results indicate that the polymerization would mainly undergo at SN2-like inversion manner to give the corresponding \u03b2-anomers as a kinetic product, because no specific participating group is included in the skeleton of 4. The use of a catalytic amount of TfOH with MS 3A might also suppress the anomerization reaction to afford the thermodynamically favorable \u03b1 -anomers.",

The method enables the rapid preparation of glycyrrhizin derivatives consisting oligosaccharides with arbitrary polymerization degree. Because other natural glycosides bearing (1 \u2192 2)-linked oligosaccharides such as cyaniding-3-O-sophoroside19 and quercetin-3-O-sophoroside20 have been reported, this method would be also applicable to the preparations of their derivatives. The present results may provide new insights into not only natural product syntheses but also the creation of high performance polymers based on a grafting reaction. Further investigations on the control of stereochemistry on the anomeric centers and the evaluation of structure\u2013activity relationship are currently in progress.",
