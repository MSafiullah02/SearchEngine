These events, in the context of an instantaneous global-media world, have placed an unprecedented emphasis on preparing for a human influenza pandemic [5, 6] . Although some argue that the media have exaggerated the threat, the warnings of an impending pandemic are not without foundation given the history of past influenza pandemics [7] , incidence of H5N1 infections among humans [8] , and the potential impact of a pandemic. Reports of the 1918 pandemic vary, but most suggested that approximately one third of the world's population was infected with 50 to 100 million deaths [9] , Computer modeling of a moderate pandemic, less severe then in 1918, in the province of Ontario, Canada predicts 73,252 admissions of influenza patients to hospitals over a 6-week period utilizing 72% of the hospital capacity, 171% of intensive care unit (ICU) capacity, and 118% of current ventilator capacity. Pandemic modeling by the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society also showed that critical care resources would be overwhelmed by even a moderate pandemic [10] .

There are three types of influenza: A, B, and C, although only A and B are pathogenic to humans [11] . Influenza viruses are sub-typed based on two of their surface proteins; hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. Hemagglutinin facilitates viral cell entry via the sialic-acid receptor whereas neuraminidase plays a role in the cleavage of glycosidic linkages allowing release of viral progeny. Influenza A has 15 distinct hemagglutinin subtypes (HI-H15) and 9 neuraminidase subtypes (N1-N9). Human strains of influenza A are referred to by a combination of their hemagglutinin and neuraminidase subtype along with the city and year in which the virus was first identified, i.e., *A/Sydney/97 H3N2'. Nomenclature for influenza B is much more straightforward as influenza B only has a single subtype of hemagglutinin (HI) and neuraminidase (Nl).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 151, "end": 155, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "I Influenza Virology and Pandemic Pre-requisltes"}, {"text": "Birds, in particular water fowl, are clearly the species with the greatest diversity of influenza A infections.

In contrast, among mammals fewer subtypes have established sustained transmission (humans Hl-3/Nl,2; pigs H1,3/N1,2; horses H3,7/ N7,8) [11] . Avian influenza is further subdivided into *low pathogenic' or 'highly pathogenic' strains. Low pathogenic infections are less virulent because they are restricted to the respiratory (usually upper) and gastrointestinal (GI) tracts. This is because their hemagglutinin precursor can only be cleaved to produce its active form by extracellular proteases found in the respiratory and GI tracts. Conversely, the significantly increased virulence seen in highly pathogenic viruses is attributable to systemic infection which occurs because alterations in the hemagglutinin allow cleavage by intracellular proteases found in all organ systems [12] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 329, "end": 333, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 974, "end": 978, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "I Influenza Virology and Pandemic Pre-requisltes"}, {"text": "To understand how novel influenza viruses evolve with the potential to cause a pandemic, one must consider the concepts of *drift' and 'shift' [9, 11, 13] .

Although much effort is being directed toward developing a H5N1 vaccine [23] [24] [25] , variations in the strain, when hemagglutinin mutations necessary for more efficient human-to-human transmission occur, may decrease the efficacy of the vaccine. Further, it is possible that the pandemic strain may not even be H5N1. A significant focus has, therefore, been placed on the potential role of antivirals for treatment or prophylaxis during a pandemic. The antivirals currently available are the adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine), which block fusion of the virus and host-cell membranes, and the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir) which block the release of viral progeny from the infected cell [20] . Computer modeling shows that antivirals could play a role in both containment of an early outbreak through prophylaxis [26] or treatment [27] , which has been favored in cost-analyses [28] .

A single pool of critical care resources exists that must be accessed by all. Thus, intensivists must plan to deal with both influenza and non-influenza patients during a pandemic which may last 12 months or more. Strategies to increase capacity include transforming non-ICU care areas, such as post-anesthetic care units, step-down units, endoscopy units, into ICUs and then assigning some units to deal with cohorts of either influenza or non-influenza patients. This task can be facilitated by creating and maintaining an inventory of all areas in your hospital that have the key requirements for conversion to an ICU: Oxygen, suction, medical gas, and electrical power, and adequate physical space to accommodate staff, equipment and patient care.

All processes and procedures are open to modification and must be considered from a new perspective including standards of care, staffing, equipment, and the allocation of resources. Although there certainly is a need to modify the standard of care during a pandemic, one must always keep in mind the primary objective of ensuring that the maximum number of people possible, survive. Thus, caution must be exercised when expanding clinical roles or modifying management to ensure that care is not compromised beyond the point where more harm is being done than good. For instance, it is of little use to move to a ventilation strategy such as long term manual ventilation with bag-valve-masks that may allow many more people to be ventilated but results in an increased number of deaths due to barotrauma than would have occurred if fewer patients were ventilated using a less harmful ventilation strategy. Striking an appropriate balance requires monitoring treatment outcomes during the response. In order to comply with medicolegal and ethical standards, plans to alter the standard of care during a pandemic should be publicly discussed and documented in advance with clear, objective criteria defined for the institution of mass critical care [44] .

The triage protocol utilizes the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score [50] and has four main components: Inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria, minimum qualifications for survival, and a prioritization tool (Table 2) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 93, "end": 97, "text": "[46,", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 98, "end": 101, "text": "47]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 182, "end": 186, "text": "[47,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 187, "end": 190, "text": "48]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 313, "end": 317, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 392, "end": 396, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 540, "end": 544, "text": "[46,", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 545, "end": 548, "text": "47]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 684, "end": 688, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1336, "end": 1340, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 1420, "end": 1424, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1509, "end": 1513, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1647, "end": 1656, "text": "(Table 2)", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "Triage"}, {"text": "A challenge ifi developing critical care triage protocols for a pandemic is that many prognostic factors, such as the natural history and response to treatment, are unknown. Given the highly complex nature of triage protocols, it is impossible to create a triage system de novo during a pandemic [46, 47] . The best way to prepare for critical care triage during a pandemic is to develop general triage guidelines [49] in advance of the pandemic and then modify the protocol once variable factors, such as probability of survival and available resources, are known. The infrastructure and training necessary to allow effective triage must also be addressed.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 296, "end": 300, "text": "[46,", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 301, "end": 304, "text": "47]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 414, "end": 418, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Triage"}, {"text": "Although influenza is an illness we contend with every year, a great deal of uncertainty exists as to what an influenza pandemic would have in store for the world. This uncertainty makes specific planning difficult and increases anxiety among both the public and health professionals. It is important to remember however, that as a pandemic draws nearer our knowledge will increase, dissipating the uncertainty. Although our plans must remain general, we must initiate the planning process now. Firstly, we do not know when the next pandemic may begin. Moreover, once a pandemic does begin, there will be insufficient time to lay the foundation upon which to mount a response. Critical care will play an instrumental role in the response to a pandemic, thus intensivists must be involved in planning the response. Intensivists bring to pandemic planning a unique understanding of treating critically ill patients and managing ICUs. Having read this chapter, intensivists should feel more comfortable engaging their colleagues in public health, infectious disease, and emergency medicine in planning together to prepare their community to respond to a pandemic.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome", "authors":
