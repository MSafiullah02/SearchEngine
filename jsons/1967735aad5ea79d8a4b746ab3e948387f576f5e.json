            "text": "Introduction The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and visual inspection of pupillary function are routine measures to monitor patients with impaired consciousness and predict their outcome in the neurointensive care unit (neuro-ICU). Our aim was to compare more recent measures, i.e. FOUR score and automated pupillometry, to standard monitoring with the GCS and visual inspection of pupils. Methods Supervised trained nursing staff examined a consecutive sample of patients admitted to the neuro-ICU of a tertiary referral centre using GCS and FOUR score and assessing pupillary function first by visual inspection and then by automated pupillometry. Clinical outcome was evaluated 6 months after admission using the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended. Results Fifty-six consecutive patients (median age 63 years) were assessed a total of 234 times. Of the 36 patients with at least one GCS score of 3, 13 had a favourable outcome. All seven patients with at least one FOUR score of \u2264 3 had an unfavourable outcome, which was best predicted by a low \"brainstem\" sub-score. Compared to automated pupillometry, visual assessment underestimated pupillary diameters (median difference, 0.4 mm; P = 0.006). Automated pupillometry detected a preserved pupillary light reflex in 10 patients, in whom visual inspection had missed pupillary constriction. Discussion Training of nursing staff to implement frequent monitoring of patients in the neuro-ICU with FOUR score and automated pupillometry is feasible. Both measures provide additional clinical information compared to the GCS and visual assessment of pupillary function, most importantly a more granular classification of patients with low levels of consciousness by the FOUR score.",

Standardised evaluation is essential to monitor clinical improvement or deterioration and response to treatment. The widely used Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was originally introduced as a tool to assess levels of consciousness in patients with acute head trauma, but is now used in most patients with impaired consciousness [22] . However, the GCS has several limitations. Most importantly, its reliance on verbal output confounds the assessment of consciousness in patients with aphasia, the locked-in syndrome and those who are intubated [1, 24] .",

Patients with a GCS of 3 for a prolonged period during their stay in the neuro-ICU are difficult to monitor for subtle changes in their clinical condition [2] . This may occur because a GCS of 3 is frequently associated with iatrogenic causes such as sedation rather than the underlying neurological condition. Indeed, in our study a GCS score of 3 was the most common result (40% of assessments) and corresponded to a wide range of FOUR scores (from 0 to 6). These patients varied widely in terms of presence or absence of brainstem reflexes, which indicates that the FOUR score allows for a more granular classification of patients with severely impaired consciousness levels. Fig. 2 Scatter plot illustrating the relationship between GCS score and FOUR score, again showing that patients with a GCS score of 3 may score very differently on the FOUR (from 0 to 6).

The validity of the FOUR score renders it a good predictor of patient outcome. Validity studies have assessed the FOUR score at a specific time point during ICU admission to define the best cut-off between favourable and unfavourable outcome, showing that the FOUR score compares favourably as a predictor [1, 2, 4, 5] .",

Automated pupillometry is more precise and can reveal pupillary constriction below 0.1 mm (in contrast to visual inspection), although the additional prognostic value in this study appeared relatively limited [11] . Still, whenever visual evaluation suggests that pupils appear not to constrict to light, automated pupillometry should be used to corroborate this, which would help avoiding wrong conclusions, including those related to prognosis. At the same time, it is important to be aware that automated pupillometry can occasionally miss a pupillary light reflex in very sluggish pupils [9] . Compared to visual inspection, however, automated pupillometry does provide detailed quantitative information such as the speed of pupillary constriction, the percentage change of pupillary diameters and dilation velocity [7, 14, 16, 23] . The potential of these data as surrogate markers for the assessment of sedation, evolving brainstem damage, intracranial hypertension or consciousness levels should be investigated in future studies. Moreover, automated pupillometry might be valuable when it is mandatory to confirm the absence of pupillary function such as during brain death determination prior to organ donation.",

Since visual inspection of pupillary size and automated pupillometry were not obtained at the exact same timepoints (but for obvious reasons a few seconds apart), some of the difference between the methods could be artificial, e.g. because of changing ambient light intensity, although we made all efforts to exclude such confounders. Despite these caveats, we were able to show that the GCS has relatively limited value as a prognostic marker in the neuro-ICU and for monitoring subtle changes in the neurological status, as compared to the FOUR score, and that automated pupillometry adds valuable quantitative information as compared to visual inspection of pupils.",

            "text": "Training of nursing staff to implement frequent monitoring with the FOUR score and automated pupillometry is feasible in the neuro-ICU. Both measures provide additional clinical information compared to the GCS and visual inspection of pupils, in particular a much more granular distinction by the FOUR among unresponsive patients with a GCS score of 3. This corroborates earlier data showing that the FOUR score performs better than the GCS for the prognostication of ICU mortality, probably because the respiratory and brainstem reflex components of the FOUR score reflect morbidity better than does the verbal part of the GCS [25] and, as stated previously, because low GCS scores are frequently iatrogenic, e.g. due to sedation and neuromuscular blocking agents. Finally, compared to visual inspection of pupils, automated pupillometry allows a much finer quantification of pupillary function, the clinical value of which needs to be addressed more in detail in future studies.",
