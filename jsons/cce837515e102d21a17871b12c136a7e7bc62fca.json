In this study, human astrocytes isolated from fetal brain were infected with HCMV AD169 and whole genome transcriptome profile was performed. The results showed that the gene expression of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs), chemokine and chemokine receptors were significantly upregulated (P < 0.01). The antiviral replication effects of IFIT1 (Interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1, Fc \u00bc 148.17) was investigated. Lentivirus with IFIT1 overexpression or knockdown was transduced into astrocytes, respectively. The viral mRNA, protein expression and HCMV titers were determined. The results showed that IE1, IE2, pp65, and viral titers were significantly decreased in IFIT1 overexpression group and enhanced in the knockdown group compared with control one (P < 0.01). Taken together, this study revealed IFIT1 played an important antiviral role in HCMV infected fetal astrocytes. The prominent feature of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is cellular tropism specificity for human fetal brain nervous system leading to severe fetal nervous damage especially in first-trimester gestation. In this study, human astrocytes isolated from firsttrimester fetal brain were infected with HCMV AD169 and IFIT1 was studied for its antiviral replication effects. The results provided insights into the function of IFIT1 as a key factor in antiviral defense contributing to development of targeted therapeutics to fetal brain with HCMV infection.",

Primary infection during pregnancy poses a 30-40% risk of intrauterine transmission, with severe adverse outcomes more likely if the infection occurs within the first trimester gestation. Due to strict viral host specificity, so far there is no animal model of HCMV infection available. Current state of knowledge of CMV pathogenesis and host defense against HCMV has come largely from clinical observation and in vitro studies with cell lines or primary human cells [Sinzger and Jahn, 1996] .",

That HCMV or its proteins modulate gene expression in astrocytes has also been investigated. After being infected by HCMV, astrocytes produce as well as respond to a number of immune mediators, including interferon, ISG (interferon-stimulated gene) proteins, cytokines, and chemokines [Grandvaux et al., 2002] to control the spread of invading HCMV.",

            "text": "Type I IFN and ISG proteins have been shown to possess antiviral properties in CNS. Early expression of cytokines in CNS has been demonstrated to correlate with the control of viral replication [Carson and Sutcliffe, 1999] . When virus contact with host cells, viral proteins and nucleic acids are detected by pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) as pathogenassociated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Subsequently, the signal transduction pathways are activated. Type I IFN and production of other cytokines are triggered. Type I IFN then augments the expression of several ISGs and subverts virus replication by a variety of mechanisms [Poland et al., 1994; Peisley and Hur, 2013] . However, not all ISGs are induced in IFN-dependent manner. Some are induced in IRF3dependent manner [Grandvaux et al., 2002] . Moreover, not all ISG proteins confer direct antiviral effects, and the anti-HCMV effects of ISG proteins have not been attributed to every ISG family members so far characterized. Inhibitory phenotypes directed at specific ISG proteins need to be studied for HCMV. Given the observed replication of the virus in the presence of multiple antiviral host proteins, it is probable that a number of ISGinhibitory phenotypes are to be uncovered for HCMV [Munir, 2013; Peisley and Hur, 2013] ; studies on ISG protein against HCMV infection were carried out using either cell lines or mature astrocytes, which do not mimic the natural course of HCMV infection and there are many gaps to be filled in the understanding of host defense against HCMV infection in CNS. To overcome these limitations, we used human fetal astrocytes of the first trimester gestation to investigate the antiviral effects of ISG proteins, with expectation of developing a targeting therapy without therapy-limiting side effects of IFNs. IFIT1 (Interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1) is one of the identified ISGs [Wathelet et al., 1986; Levy et al., 2004] . All members in IFIT family contain multiple tetratricopeptide motifs that are known to mediate protein-protein interactions through scaffolds formed among tandem TPR repeats [Lamb et al., 1995] . IFIT1 is induced in response to type I IFNs stimulation, presence of double-stranded RNAs, and virus infection [Guo et al., 2000; Terenzi et al., 2006] . IFIT1 interacts with the translation initiation factor eIF-3, leading to the inhibition of protein synthesis. IFIT1 has been implicated to have similar antiviral effects as IFNs in fighting against West Nile virus and LCMV [Wacher et al., 2007] . It is also reported to inhibit human papillomavirus DNA replication by binding to the viral protein E1 [Terenzi et al., 2008] ; studies demonstrated that the 2 0 -O methylation of the 5 0 cap of viral RNA functions to subvert innate host antiviral responses through escape of IFIT-mediated suppression [Daffis et al., 2010] ; It was discovered that IFIT proteins selectively recognize viral RNA via a 5 0 -triphosphate group (PPP-RNA), and lend insight into their downstream effector function [Pichlmair et al., 2011; Abbas et al., 2013] . Recently, it was reported that ISG54 and ISG56 may contribute to immune and inflammatory reactions elicited by TLR3/IFN-b signaling pathway in astrocytes, and may play an important role both in antiviral immunity and in neuroinflammatory diseases [Imaizumi et al., 2014] . However, little has been reported to date on the protective mechanism of IFIT1 against HCMV infection.",

The NimbleGen platform proposes high-density expression arrays in which every human gene is represented by several independent probes. These probes consist of 60-mers isothermal oligonucleotides, which show more robust hybridization than shorter oligonucleotides. The NimbleGen human expression array (Format: 12 \u00c2 135k; Source: NCBI; Build: HG18, Build 36; Probe Length: 60 mer; Genes: 45033; Probes/Target: 3; Replicates: 1) involves 45,033 gene transcripts (i.e., different accession numbers corresponding to the same or different isoforms). DNA end-labeling, hybridization, scanning, and data normalization were performed at NimbleGen, which provided the final data file. Array hybridization using the NimbleGen Hybridization System followed by washing with the NimbleGen wash buffer kit and Array scanning using the Axon GenePix 4000B microarray scanner (Molecular Devices Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA) were conducted. Scanned images were then imported into NimbleScan software (version 2.5) for grid alignment and expression data analysis. Expression data were normalized through quantile normalization and the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) algorithm included in the Nimble Scan software. The Probe level files and Gene level files were generated after normalization. All gene level files were imported into Agilent GeneSpring GX software (version 11.5.1) for further analysis. Genes that at least nine out of nine samples greater than or equal to lower cut-off: 50.0 were chosen for data analysis. Differentially expressed genes between two samples were identified through Fold Change filtering. Differentially expressed genes between two groups were identified through Volcano Plot filtering. A set of genes presenting an average of at least twofold induction/repression calculated from the different probes specific for each gene spotted on the NimbleGen chip were selected for promoter analysis.

As one gene is often represented by several transcripts, we focused only on those genes represented by two or more transcripts and displaying a mean fold difference !2.0 and t-test P-value <0.05. With these criteria, we found that about 154 genes, including 138 up-regulated and 16 down-regulated, were modulated at 6 hr p.i.

To verify the results, the mRNA expression of up-regulated genes IFIT1, MXA, MXB, CCL5, CXCL2, BST2, IL8, IL11 at 6 hr p.i vs con and astrocyte genes GFAP and Vim were confirmed by qRT-PCR (Fig. 1B) .

HCMV\u00c0, mock infected astrocytes, HCMV\u00fe, HCMV infected astrocytes; \u00c3 , statistical significance P < 0.05. astrocytes compared with mock infected group at 6 hr p.i. GO analysis showed the top five categories in biological process and all belonged to cell response to stimuli (Table II) . ISGs involved in antiviral response process in early infection time [Ho and van den Pol, 2007] exhibited the highest fold changes in HCMV infected astrocytes compared with mock infected group at 6 hr p.i. However, this result was not consistent with the finding that microglia not astrocytes could produce antiviral cytokines in response to CMV infection [Lokensgard et al., 2002] . The reason could be that the response to HCMV infection in fetal astrocytes was different from mature astrocytes or cell lines. These up-regulated ISGs included IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3, IFITM1, MXA, MXB, OAS1, OAS2, OASL, USP18, USP41, IFI44, and BST2. It also showed that gene expression levels of chemokine and chemokine receptors (IL-11, MCP-1, IL-8, RANTES, IP-10, and MIP-1a, Table III) were up-regulated compared to mock infected group at 6 hr p.i. This result was consistent with the report that CMVinfected human brain vascular pericytes and astrocytes released substantial amounts of the chemokines MCP-1, MIP-1a, and IL-8 [Lokensgard et al., 2002; Alcendor et al., 2012] . Several studies have demonstrated that chemokine play important roles in regulating brain inflammation during viral encephalitis because of their chemotactic properties, and the importance of CCL5, CCL3, CCL4, IL-11, IL-8, and MCP-1 in regulating immune responses in the CNS have been emphasized [Weiss et al., 1998; Kutsch et al., 2000; Zlotnik, 2000] . Our results showed different fold changes of these cytokines and chemokines in HCMV infected astrocytes (Table III) . Additionally, it has also been reported that early local expression of cytokines with antiviral properties in the CNS such as TNFa, IFNa, IFNb, and IFN\u0263 correlates with control of viral replication. IFN treatment induces the expression of a large set of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), whose protein products prevent infection with many pathogens, including HCMV [Samuel, 2001] . In present study, the results showed different fold changes with IL-1b, IL-8, IL-6 in HCMV infected astrocytes compared with mock infected group at 6 hr p.i, while TNFa, IFNa, IFNb, or IFN\u0263 exhibited little gene expression level in HCMV or mock infected astrocytes and fold changes were no statistical significance in HCMV infected astrocytes compared with mock infected control. The results suggested that HCMV infected astrocytes defended themselves against HCMV infection through expressing of ISGs, cytokines, and chemokines which either exert direct antiviral activities, or recruit antiviral immune cells such as microglia to the sites of infection [Peterson et al., 1997] and ISGs exerted important role in antiviral action. However, it is also plausible that only a subset of ISGs is essential for protection against a specific pathogen or groups of related pathogens. Thus, identification of pathogen-specific ISGs might lead to development of targeted therapeutics.",

            "text": "Secondly, IFIT1 with the highest Fc among all upregulated genes (6 hr p.i vs con) was studied for its antiviral effects. Overexpression Lentivirus lv/IFIT1/ EGFP gene was transduced into astrocytes or HELFs, respectively. Cells were infected with HCMV AD169 for 72 hr. Cell appearance showed no change in lv/IFIT1/EGFP transduced astrocytes compared with lv/ctl/EGFP transduced control group at 72 hr p.i, while morphological changes were observed in lv/ IFIT1/EGFP and lv/ctl/EGFP transduced HELFs. The different antiviral effects of IFIT1 on astrocytes and HELFs might be caused different expression of cellular factors, which may be responsible for the modulation of viral gene expression [Towler et al., 2012] , and reinforce the reason to investigate the specific antiviral replication role of IFIT1 in fetal astrocytes. Furthermore, mRNA expression of IE1, IE2, and pp65 were detected by QRT-PCR at 4, 6, 12 hr p.i and protein expression were detected by western blot at 24, 48 hr p.i, due to the delayed expression of protein compared to mRNA. The results showed that both mRNA and protein expressions were significantly reduced compared with lv/ctl/EGFP transduced control (P < 0.001). HCMV replication cycle in fetal astrocytes was 48-72 hr (showed in our previous study). Therefore, the release of HCMV infectious particles in cell culture medium and HCMV titer within astrocytes were determined at 48 and 72 hr p.i. The results showed significant decreases in the release of HCMV infectious particles in cell culture medium and in HCMV titer within astrocytes in lv/ IFIT1/EGFP transduced astrocytes compared with the control (P < 0.001). Finally, to further verify the antiviral effects of IFIT1, shIFIT1-1 was used for knocking down IFIT1 gene. After shIFIT1-1 lentivirus was transduced into astrocytes for 48 hr, cells were infected with HCMV AD169. Viral mRNA, protein expression levels and HCMV titers were determined, which showed significant increases in mRNA expressions of IE1, IE2, pp65, and viral titers in knockdown group compared with the control (P < 0.01), suggesting the antiviral replication effects of IFIT1 in fetal astrocytes. This is the first report on antiviral effects of IFIT1 in human fetal astrocytes to date and these findings also pointed to the potential importance of studying human primary first-trimester gestation astrocytes because the antiviral effects of particular cytokines depend on specific cell surface receptors that may not be present or functional on established glial cell lines.",

            "text": "Functional studies have shown that IFITs inhibit the translation of viral proteins via different mechanisms. In early studies, IFITs were found to bind eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3) and interfere with viral protein translation . Recent studies showed that IFITs can distinguish the different features between host and viral RNAs, block West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and coronavirus mutants that lack 2 0 -O-methyltransferase activity. Inhibition by IFIT1 occurs by preferentially sequestering capped RNA lacking a 2 0 -O-methyl group and preventing eukaryotic translation initiation factors from binding to the RNA template specifically [Daffis et al., 2010; Habjan et al., 2013; Kimura et al., 2013] . IFIT1 was also identified as an eIF3-associated protein fractionating with hepatitis C virus (HCV) translation complexes in IFN-treated cells [Wang et al., 2003] . IFIT1 blocks translation driven by the HCV internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and the inhibition depends on eIF3 binding by IFIT1. However, another study suggested IFIT1 preferentially inhibits cap-dependent translation but not translation of the EMCV IRES , since the EMCV IRES is different from that of HCV and functions by a different mechanism. IFIT1 also inhibits human papillomavirus DNA replication by binding to the viral protein E1 [Terenzi et al., 2008] . Nevertheless, several important questions still remain to be addressed. Our data verified that IFIT1 possessed anti-HCMV function by inhibiting virus replication in human fetal astrocytes. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. There are possibilities that IFIT1 inhibits DNA replication by binding to the viral protein, or by suppressing HCMV protein translation by binding eIF3. It will be interesting to ponder new information on the uncovered the processes described here and on how to exploit for novel clinical antiviral or therapeutic strategies.",
