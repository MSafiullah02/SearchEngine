It is a structural protein present in abundance inside the virion that forms a complex with polymerase proteins and the viral RNA (vRNA) genome. NP is a multifunctional protein playing important roles in transcription, replication, morphogenesis and budding of the virus 3. Hence, it is pertinent that NP interacts with a multitude of host proteins to modulate their functions for the benefit of the virus. To identify host proteins that interact with NP and other viral proteins of IAV, two technologies have been extensively used: the yeast two\u2010hybrid (Y2H) system 4, 5 and biochemical purification/MS 6. The recently developed RNA interference (RNAi) based screening technique is being widely used to deduce the host cellular pathways and host factors involved in the IAV replication 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. In the present study, using the Y2H system, we identified human \u03b1\u2010actinin\u20104 (referred to subsequently as actinin\u20104) as a novel interacting partner of IAV NP. Actinin\u20104 is a ubiquitously present, non\u2010muscle isoform of \u03b1\u2010actinin that cross\u2010links F\u2010actin together with other proteins and keeps the cytoskeleton intact 12. Out of the four isoforms of human \u03b1\u2010actinin, actinin\u20101 and actinin\u20104 are reported to be present in cell protrusions and cell adhesions of numerous cell types. Actinin\u20101 and actinin\u20104 share 80% nucleotide homology and 87% similarity in their amino acid sequence 13. Actinin\u20104 is known to be found in tight junctions 12, 14.",

We report that knockdown of actinin\u20104 expression reduced viral gene transcription and replication, indicating that actinin\u20104 plays a crucial role in influenza viral replication. Our results also suggest that the NP\u2013actinin\u20104 interaction may aid nuclear localization of NP during viral infection, thus emphasizing the physiological relevance of this association.

To analyze this further, we depleted the A549 cells of actinin\u20104 by treating them with actinin\u20104 siRNA, followed by infection with PR8 at a MOI of 1 and observed the significantly reduced localization of NP in nucleus compared to control siRNA using an immunofluorescence assay (Fig. 4B).

Upon IAV infection, actinin\u20104 was observed to accumulate increasingly around the nucleus (white arrows) compared to the uninfected cell (yellow arrows) (Fig. 6E,F). Based on this observation, it can be hypothesized that the increase in the expression of actinin\u20104 may be attributed to the transport of NP across the nucleus. Because we observed co\u2010localization of these two proteins in the cytoplasm, we examined changes in the localization of NP in the absence of actinin\u20104. Notably, NP was retained in the cytoplasm with reduced transport to the nucleus. In support of this observation, actinin\u20104 is known to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm and is imported into the nucleus through the nuclear pore complex in an import\u2010independent manner 32. Therefore, our data suggest that actinin\u20104 might be involved in facilitating shuttling of NP/viral ribonucleoproteins across subcellular compartments to promote virus replication. Because actinin\u20104 is known to interact with actin within the cytoskeletal framework, it is possible that the shuttling of NP between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments may involve the formation of a ternary complex of NP, actinin\u20104 and actin. The retention of NP inside the nucleus as a result of the migration of actinin\u20104 from the cytoskeleton to the nucleus on treating the cells with wortmannin furthered our hypothesis. These possibilities remain to be examined more carefully.",

It is conceivable that the reduction in viral titers leads to a commensurate decrease in the viral protein translation in actinin\u20104 depleted cells. The reduction in replicase activity of the polymerase in actinin\u20104 depleted cells further strengthens our hypothesis that actinin\u20104 plays a direct or indirect role in the replication of influenza life cycle. This is also consistent with previous studies showing that actinin\u20104 interacts with several transcription factors, including the RelA/p65 subunit of transcription factor NF\u2010\u03ba\u03b2 in the nucleus, cytoplasm and mRNA processing 36, 37, 38, 39, 40.",
