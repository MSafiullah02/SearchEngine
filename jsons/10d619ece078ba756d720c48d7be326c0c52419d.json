For infected individuals harboring drugsusceptible virus, this approach has afforded complete or near-complete viral suppression. However, in the absence of a curative strategy, the predictable emergence of drug-resistant variants requires continued development of improved antiviral strategies, inherent to which is the necessity of identifying novel targets. Regulatory elements that mediate transcription, translation, nucleocytoplasmic transport, dimerization, packaging and reverse transcription of the (+) strand RNA genome should now be considered viable targets for small molecule, peptide-and oligonucleotide-based therapeutics. Where target specificity and cellular penetration and toxicity have been the primary obstacle to successful \"macromolecule therapeutics\", this chapter summarizes (a) novel approaches targeting RNA motifs whose three-dimensional structure is critical for biological function and consequently may be less prone to resistance-conferring mutations and (b) improved methods for delivery.

Shortly thereafter, a second HIV accessory protein, the regulator of expression of virion proteins (Rev) whose interaction with another cisacting RNA (the Rev responsive element or RRE) regulated nucleocytoplasmic export of full-length and singly-spliced viral RNAs was reported (Feinberg et al. 1986) . Surprisingly, more than 25 years after the crucial contribution of the Tat/TAR and Rev/RRE axes to HIV-1 replication was demonstrated, these RNAs, the viral and host proteins with which they interact, and the resulting nucleoprotein complexes have not proven therapeutically accessible, based primarily on a lack of selectivity of small molecules and inefficient delivery of larger therapeutic oligonucleotides.

This interaction, in conjunction with the cellular co-factor transcription elongation factor-b (P-TEFb), significantly enhances transcription elongation (Karn 1999) . As such, targeting the Tat/TAR axis to interrupt the virus life cycle at the level of transcription can be considered. However, additional roles of TAR suggest it could also be targeted to affect multiple steps of reverse transcription. Since the TAR and poly(A) hairpins collectively constitute the repeat (R) region, they are represented at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 termini of the (+) strand viral RNA, and likely play a role in (\u2212) strand DNA transfer, which exploits R homology. Mutagenesis studies ) have shown that structural features of the TAR hairpin facilitate (\u2212) strand DNA transfer, while Huthoff and Berkhout (2001) have demonstrated that mutations in the same region affect the equilibrium between the alternate configurations of the 5\u2032 UTR (designated the long distance base pairing and branched conformations) that regulate tRNA-primed initiation of reverse transcription. A role for TAR in initiation of reverse transcription has also been proposed (Harrich et al. 2000) . Thus, while the mechanistic basis for these observations requires further experimentation, they highlight a potentially pleiotropic role for the Tat/TAR axis that should be exploited therapeutically.",

Despite this promising result, in vivo efficacy was not observed. However, subsequent studies have been encouraging, showing that polyamide nucleic acid analogs (PNAs) designed to interact with the TAR apical loop and adjacent bulged nucleotides substantially inhibited Tat-mediated transactivation in vitro system and, when transfected into CEM cells, lead to a significant drop in virus infectivity (Kaushik et al. 2002) .",

Although Lee et al. have elegantly demonstrated inhibition of HIV-1 replication in MT-4 cells at non-toxic concentrations (Lee et al. 2005) , the conformational flexibility of linear polypeptides had the drawback of promoting off-target interactions and sensitivity to proteolysis. These drawbacks can, however, be overcome by the construction of \"stapled\" or conformationally-constrained peptides. First described in 2004 as a means of activating apoptosis to target leukemia (Walensky et al. 2004 ), stapling of native peptides represents a novel therapeutic strategy by modulating protein-protein interactions. Using a similar strategy, Varani and colleagues (Lalonde et al. 2011) have designed a series of cyclic, cell-permeable peptides that competitively inhibit the Tat/TAR interaction in vivo at sub-micromolar concentrations with minimal cytotoxicity. Surprisingly, but in keeping with the pleiotropic nature of the Tat/TAR axis, time-of-addition experiments indicated that, in addition to viral transcription, these cyclic peptides also acted at the level of reverse transcription. Resistance of branched peptide (BP) ligands to proteases and peptidases has promoted their use as a novel class of multivalent non-toxic, cell-permeable therapeutics. These features have been exploited to create a class of peptides that bound TAR RNA with low to sub-micromolar affinity (Bryson et al. 2012) , most likely spanning nucleotides of both the apical loop and neighboring trinucleotide bulge.",

The ATCUN motif features a three amino acid sequence, X 1 -X 2 -His, of which X 1 and X 2 can be any amino acid and X 1 must have a free amino terminal group. This approach would require simple modification of linear peptides and, while the cyclic peptides afford no free N-terminus, appending the tripeptide to a lysine side chain is feasible, thereby creating a \"metallo-peptide\" capable of targeting TAR and promoting its nucleolytic degradation.

Our own work has involved the construction of small molecule microarrays that can be probed with fluorescently-labeled RNA structural motifs, such as the TAR apical loop. Using this approach (Sztuba-Solinska et al. 2014), we have identified a novel chemotype (Fig. 2d ) that binds the TAR hairpin with micromolar affinity, inhibits HIV-1 replication in culture and is not cytotoxic.

Beyond pbs-mediated base pairing, additional intermolecular tRNA-viral RNA interactions have been proposed as critical mediators of the HIV-1 initiation process. These include interactions between (i) an the A-rich loop of the U5-IR hairpin and the U-rich tRNA Lys,3 anticodon domain (ii), nucleotides of the U5-IR stem, designated the primer activation signal or PAS, with those of the tRNA T\u03a8C stem and (iii) nucleotides of the unique 3\u2032 region (U3) with those of the tRNA anticodon stem (Abbink and Berkhout 2008a) . Thus, from a steric interference perspective, the tRNA/viral RNA duplex offers several potential therapeutic targets, an example of which was the ability of a short 2\u2032-O-methyl labeled oligonucleotide directed to the pbs to competitively inhibit tRNA Lys,3 binding in vitro and HIV-1 replication in HeLa cells (Freund et al. 2001) . Curiously, although a considerable body of literature is available for the structure of the tRNA/viral RNA complex (Lanchy et al. 2000) kinetic characterization of tRNA-primed DNA synthesis (Lanchy et al. 1996) and the conformational dynamics of HIV-1 RT associated with these events (Liu et al. 2010) , the mechanism whereby the tRNA primer is incorporated into the budding virion and subsequently hybridized to the pbs has, until only recently, received little attention. The interaction of human lysyl tRNA synthetase (LysRS) with the capsid (CA) domain of the Gag precursor (via its C-terminal domain or CTD) was identified by Kleiman and colleagues, whose related studies elegantly showed that disrupting LysRS synthesis reduced tRNA Lys,3 incorporation into virions its and annealing to the viral RNA genome (Guo et al. 2003) . With the goal of disrupting LysRS/CA interactions, combinatorial library screening, Dewan et al. (2012) have subsequently identified two cyclic peptides (whose clinical application takes advantage of their enhanced resistance to proteolytic degradation) that are active in vitro in the low micromolar range. While the in vivo selectivity of this first-in-class LysRS/CA antagonists has not be demonstrated, it paves the way for development of modified cyclic peptides with improved cell penetration and pharmacokinetic properties.",

The absolute requirement for this cis-acting signal, for which high resolution crystallographic data for the DIS \"kissing\" and extended duplex are available, promoted construction of a neamine dimer (Fig. 3d) as a novel small molecule class that targeted the DIS interface by interacting with both RNA strands (Bodlenner et al. 2007 ). In vitro analysis has confirmed that such compounds indeed targeted the DIS loop and stabilized the kissing complex, although their cellular toxicity and ability to inhibit virus replication remains to be established. Crystallographic data of kissing loop/aminoglycoside complexes has illustrated a critical interaction of DIS residue A280 with loop 1 of the aminoglycoside neomycin (Fig. 3a) . Ennifar and colleagues have taken advantage of this information to targeted the RNA dimer with a thymine-containing aminoglycoside chimera (Fig. 3c) capable of hydrogen bonding with A280 (Ennifar et al. 2013 ). Binding to the DIS kissing loop was confirmed by isothermal titration calorimetry and supported by the inability of their analog to interact with an A280U mutant predicted to disrupt Watson-Crick base pairing. Although the affinity for this thymine-neomycin chimera for the DIS was moderate (K d = 5.3 \u03bcM), an encouraging observation was its ability, in contrast to previous aminoglycosides, to interact with the DIS of multiple HIV-1 subtypes without any significant change in affinity. Although antiviral activity remains to be established, this work provides an encouraging example of the potential for structure-based drug design to direct the development of dimerization antagonists with improved potency and selectivity.

However, a landmark NMR study of a dimeric RNA containing the entire 5\u2032 UTR and the immediate 5\u2032 region of gag has provided an elegant model that proposes the -G-G-A-G-tetraloop of the packaging signal (\u03a8, defined by stem-loop (SL) 3 of the core HIV-1 packaging domain) is recognized by the NC domain of the Gag precursor through an RNA structural switch linking translation, dimerization and packaging (Fig. 4a, b) . A subsequent study (Stephenson et al. 2013) , has coupled chemical probing data of the 5\u2032 UTR with through-space distances derived from single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments. This analysis, while supporting models derived by NMR, highlighted a kink-turn motif whose mutagenesis was previously shown to impair packaging, suggesting it may provide a Gag binding site. Together, these complementary, high-resolution techniques have provided a much-needed structural basis for antiviral strategies designed to interrupt genome packaging, possibly antagonizing the proposed Gag-mediated structural switch from translation of the viral genome to its incorporation into the budding virion.",

(2013) RNA over non-specific single-and double-stranded RNA, and disrupted the interaction with HIV-1 NC protein as measured by gel electrophoretic mobility shift analysis. Bell et al. have designed a high-throughput fluorogenic assay that monitors Gag-mediated disruption of the \u03a8-containing SL-3 RNA and used this to screen two small molecule libraries totaling *2600 compounds (Bell et al. 2013 ). In addition to chemotypes previously shown to interact with DNA, these authors identified the quinolinium derivative NSC260594 (Fig. 4c ) that in culture significantly reduced virus infectivity in the low micromolar range. 1 H-NMR spectroscopy of SL-3 in the presence of NSC260594 indicated little to no influence on stem nucleotides, while in contrast, significant perturbation of nucleotides comprising the -G-G-A-G-tetraloop was observed in the presence of a molar equivalent of the ligand, indicating a 1:1 stoichiometry. An equivalent analysis demonstrated that the non-discriminatory intercalator ellipticine interacted exclusively with nucleotides of the SL-3 stem, providing a promising measure of NSC260594 specificity. The notion that an important interaction of Gag with viral RNA might be the targeted by this small molecule can be inferred from 1 H-NMR studies (De Guzman et al. 1998) , which have shown that the SL-3 -G-G-A-G-tetraloop provides a tight binding site for HIV-1 NC. Finally, targeting \u03a8 RNA may not be restricted to small molecules, evidenced by 1 H-NMR analysis demonstrating that a short, tryptophan-rich polypeptide (proposed as an NC mimic) also interacts with the -G-G-A-G-tetraloop (Dietz et al. 2008) .",

The frameshift signal of HIV-1 group M is illustrated in Fig. 5a , b, comprising a heptanucleotide 'slippery' sequence followed by the frameshift stimulatory signal, an irregular helix whose upper and lower stem are separated by a 3-nucleotide purine bulge (a feature maintained within an individual subtype, while varying between subtypes). Although the precise mechanism underlying frameshifting remains open to debate, maintaining the correct Gag:Gag-Pol ratio appears critical to virion assembly and maturation. Small molecules or nucleic acids that interact with the frameshift signal and alter this critical balance through its disruption or stabilization would therefore seem an attractive therapeutic strategy.",

            "text": "High throughput screening of a library of *50,000 chemical entities by Hung et al. (1998) indicated that the benzene derivative RG501 (Fig. 5c) was capable of increasing HIV-1 frameshift efficiency approximately two-fold and impairing virus spread in culture. However, RG501 was shown to interact with a variety of RNA helices, suggesting toxicity issues would arise as a consequence of preferential targeting of ribosomal RNA. Despite the negative outcome, Marscheschi et al. (2011) have demonstrated by NMR spectroscopy that RG501 binds in the major groove of the frameshift signal and, by hydrogen bonding to phosphate groups on opposite sides, alters the conformation of the -G-G-A-trinucleotide bulge, providing important structural data for the rational design of derivatives with increased potency and selectivity. Although modification of the basic screening strategy (Dulude et al. 2008 ) yielded a series of arginine-rich peptides capable of reducing frameshift efficiency, these appeared to be equally non-selective. More encouraging results have been reported by Ofori et al. (2014) , who have investigated the effect of nucleic acid-intercalating peptide antibiotics on ribosomal frameshifting. Among these, a benzo [g] quinolone-containing analog (Fig. 5d ) bound the frameshift site with an affinity of *100 nM, and with increased selectivity over non-specific RNA. This analog was cell permeable, exhibited minimal cytotoxicity, and decreased virus infectivity, which correlated with increased levels of frameshifting. In parallel with the search for improved small molecule ligands, the potential of oligonucleotide-based inhibition, via steric blocking, should not be overlooked, based on studies by Ahn et al. (2011a) who demonstrated that PNAs designed to hybridize to the frameshift site suppressed replication of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, while a second class that targets the three major stem-loop (SL) domains of X-RNA inhibited RNA synthesis initiation in hepatitis C virus (Ahn et al. 2011b ). Early attempts to target the HIV-1 RRE, which is responsible for nucleocytoplasmic transport of unspliced and singly-spliced viral RNAs, have involved small molecules, such as neomycin B and related aminoglycosides which, as outlined earlier, have suffered from lack of specificity and poor cellular uptake (Ahn et al. 2011b ). Likewise, trans-dominant negative Rev mutants, while a promising alternative, led to rapid acquisition of mutations conferring resistance (Legiewicz et al. 2008 ). Thus, new modalities of targeting the Rev/RRE interaction are warranted. Both structural and mutagenesis analyses have shown that the \u03b1-helical arginine-rich motif (ARM) of Rev mediates a critical interaction with the RRE by inserting into the major groove of an asymmetric bulge in stem-loop IIB. Based on these observations, Mills et al. (2006) synthesized a series of ARM-like conformationally-constrained peptidomimetics to antagonize the Rev/RRE interaction. Of 15 candidate peptidomimetics examined, one bound the RRE with equivalent affinity as the ARM (K d *50 nM), while control experiments indicated that its unconstrained counterpart showed little specificity.",

Such bifunctional metallo-inhibitors combine a high affinity targeting motif (the Rev ARM) with a metal chelate complex capable of damaging RNA in the vicinity of the ARM binding site via a variety of oxidative chemistries. Proof of this strategy was demonstrated by the ability of Cu ++ -Gly-Gly-His-ARM complexes to selectively cleave the RRE both in vitro (Jin and Cowan 2006) and in vivo . This approach has more recently been extended to investigate the oxidative properties of the Rev ARM when linked to the metal chelators 1,4,7,10tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA), diethylenetriamineepentaacetic acid (DTPA), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) (Joyner and Cowan 2013) (Fig. 6) . For each of these complexes, high affinity binding to RRE stem-loop IIB was retained (varying from 0.2 to 16 nM versus 1.6 nM for the unmodified peptide). The Cu ++ -bound metal chelates of each were found to be most efficient in RRE cleavage, with activity varying 15-fold in the order Cu-NTA-Rev > Cu-DOTA-Rev > Cu-DTPA-Rev > Cu-EDTA-Rev, representing a *50-fold improvement over the Cu ++ -Gly-Gly-His-ARM complex. In a biological setting, oxidative damage of the RRE would result in dissociation of the metal chelate-ARM complex, which can be \"reactivated\" by reducing agents such as ascorbic acid or glutathione, the concentration of which is sufficiently high in vivo. Also, since the K d for the bound metal is of the order of 10 \u221215 M, toxicity resulting from its leaching from the complex is likely to be minimal.",

High throughput screening of an *50,000 branched peptide boronic acid (BPBA) library, (whose boronic acid substituent was designed to mimic an acceptor for RNA 2\u2032 OH groups as well as improve selectivity for RNA over DNA) identified a candidate peptide (BPBA1) that bound RRE stem-loop IIB with micromolar affinity (Zhang et al. 2013 ) and a 1:1 stoichiometry. Significant losses in binding affinity with linear peptides (*50-fold) suggested that all \"arms\" of this branched peptide participated in its interaction with stem-loop IIB. A complementary analysis with stem-loop IIB variants provided strong support for the notion that the correct tertiary structure of the target RNA was a prerequisite to high affinity BPBA1 binding. Consistent with these findings, enzymatic footprinting highlighted several regions of stem-loop IIB that were rendered nuclease-insensitive in the presence of the branched peptide.

While the role for the cPPT has been somewhat controversial, mutational studies (Hu et al. 2010) have raised the intriguing notion that, perhaps in conjunction with the central termination sequence (CTS), the cPPT is less relevant to nuclear import than to minimize exposure of unpaired (\u2212) strand DNA to host restriction factors such as the family of APOBEC proteins. These issues notwithstanding, accurate selection of the 3\u2032 and cPPT primers from the RNA/DNA replication intermediate and their removal from nascent (+) strand DNA represent critical steps in the viral replication cycle.",

            "text": "Despite extensive mutagenesis analysis (Rausch and Le Grice 2007) , the structural basis for resistance of PPT-containing RNA/DNA hybrids to RNase H-mediated cleavage remains unclear. However, structural studies that combined mass spectrometry with NMR , raise the possibility that the PPT could be targeted by small molecules designed to antagonize its selection or removal from nascent (+) DNA. Electrospray ionization-Fourier transfer ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry has the particular advantage of allowing multiplexing, i.e. the interaction of nucleic acid ligands with several PPT variants could be simultaneously investigated, based on their mass signatures. Using this approach, Turner et al. showed that short PPT-containing RNA/DNA hybrids contained two binding sites for the aminoglycoside neomycin B . Tandem mass spectrometry (which essentially provided a \"footprint\" of the PPT/neomycin B complex) demonstrated that, at a 1:1 neomycin B:PPT ratio, the aminoglycoside bound at the PPT/U3 junction. Increasing this ratio to 2:1 identified the second, upstream aminoglycoside binding site at the 5\u2032 extremity of the PPT (Fig. 7) . Consistent with these observations, 1 H-NMR of a 1:1 neomycin B:PPT hybrid showed shifts in imino proton signals at positions corresponding to the PPT/ U3 junction and evidence for a second binding site as the ratio was increased. Subsequent NMR analysis in the presence of HIV-1 RT indicated contact between protein and nucleic acid in the same two regions, while equivalent findings with RT from the LTR-retrotransposon Ty3 and its cognate PPT (Brinson et al. 2009 ) suggested that structural features at either extremity of the PPT may be a more general feature contributing to its recognition. Such data are not intended to imply the therapeutic use of neomycin B, which is known to bind to a variety of RNA structures, but rather to illustrate that more selective nucleic acid ligands could be developed to disrupt (+) strand DNA synthesis.",

            "text": "An intriguing means by which the HIV PPT might be targeted in the context of the single-stranded RNA genome, the RNA/DNA intermediate, or the integrated double-stranded DNA involves the use of triplex forming oligonucleotides (TFOs), which bind to the oligopurine strand of the duplex through Hoogsteen or reverse Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds. Studies by Volkmann and Moelling have demonstrated that, in vitro, a TFO targeted against the PPT rendered the PPT/U3 junction refractory to RNase H-mediated hydrolysis and, as a consequence, inhibited initiation of (+) strand DNA synthesis (Volkmann et al. 1995) . In order to determine whether the PPT sequence of the single-stranded viral RNA genome and not the RNA/DNA replication intermediate might also respond to triplex formation, these authors targeted the single-stranded PPT with a TFO wherein the Watson-Crick and Hoogsteen base pairing sequence were on the same strand and separated by a short linker sequence. This \"sandwich\" TFO, which was suggested to be thermodynamically more efficient than the three-stranded system, also rendered the PPT refractory to RNase H-mediated cleavage in vitro, and inhibited de novo HIV infection in culture. Finally, although the HIV RNA genome is the focus of this review, it is worth noting that Giovannangeli et al. have used the TFO approach to target the HIV-1 PPT in the context of the integrated proviral DNA. Using a TFOpsoralen conjugate, these authors successfully converted the non-covalent threestranded structure into a localized covalent lesion on genomic DNA following UV irradiation of cells (Giovannangeli et al. 1997) .

A promising advance in this area has been the development of short cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), comprising combinations of natural or unnatural amino acids, the basis of which was the original observation that HIV-1 Tat could enter cells when added to the culture medium. In addition to the arginine-rich Tat peptide, other natural CPPs have been identified, including penetratin, herpesvirus tegument protein VP22 and inv3 of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, each of which has the capacity to promote intracellular uptake of conjugated cargoes (Copolovici et al. 2014) . As proof-of-principle, Roisin et al. (2004) have shown that a Tat-derived CPP, linked to peptide ligands, antagonized the interaction of Rev with cellular factors critical to nucleocytoplasmic RNA transport, inhibiting HIV-1 replication in both primary lymphocytes and macrophages.",

Oligonucleotides containing peptide nucleic acid (PNA) locked nucleic acid (LNA) or phosphorodiamidate morpholino (PMO) analogs are most commonly used in order to avoid complications arising through interactions between negatively charged nucleic acid and the positively charged CPP. Following their uptake, endosomal release of CPPoligonucleotide complexes presents the next challenge. Inhibitory CPP-PNA conjugates targeted to the TAR hairpin could be released from endosomes by chloroquine treatment which, while clinically impractical, demonstrated endosomal release as a rate limiting step (Turner et al. 2005) . Alternative strategies to promote endosomal release have included the identification of CPPs that themselves elicit endosomolytic activity and CPP modification via stearylation, myristoylation or incorporation of chloroquine-functionalized dendrons on the backbone. A more comprehensive review of CPP-directed oligonucleotide delivery, its challenges and future potential can be found in Lee et al. (2013) .",

Many of these complexes are now being dissected at the atomic level by a variety of biophysical approaches, including X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, small angle X-ray scattering and cryo-EM tomography. Such successes have collectively provided us with a wealth of RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions that can be antagonized to disrupt HIV replication, in the form of small molecules, peptides and therapeutic RNAs. The development of novel, cost-effective fluorescence-based high-throughput screening methodologies recapitulating these interactions should be an encouragement to accelerate our \"assault\" on the HIV-1 RNA genome and complement ongoing efforts to target RNA for the treatment of a multitude of disease states.",
