A variety of strategies are used for managing unowned cats, including housing cats individually or in small groups for a limited time (short-term shelters), bringing cats together in long-term free-roaming group enclosures (sanctuaries), using family-based homecare (foster homes), or avoiding housing cats altogether (trap-neuter-return programs). Some systems bring homeless cats into close contact with people, including children and other individuals who may be uniquely susceptible to disease caused by enteropathogens. The majority of cats are ultimately placed back into the community, either via adoption or returning to their neighborhoods in trap-neuter-return programs.",

            "text": "Diarrhea is common in cats cared for by animal welfare organizations and can be present when cats are initially admitted or develop during confinement. Causes of diarrhea include factors such as stress, dietary change, microbiome dysbiosis (Suchodolski et al., 2015), and infectious enteropathogens. A variety of feline and zoonotic enteropathogens capable of inducing diarrhea have been documented in unowned cats (Hill et al., 2000, Spain et al., 2001, Mekaru et al., 2007, Gow et al., 2009, Weese, 2011, Sabshin et al., 2012, Spada et al., 2013, Raab et al., 2016). Factors that affect transmission of enteropathogens include single vs. group housing, sanitation practices, facility construction, preventive health protocols, host immunity, and the prevalence of other infectious organisms (Pedersen et al., 2004). However, not all infections are associated with diarrhea, making it difficult to identify and segregate cats that may be shedding enteropathogens based on clinical signs alone (Hill et al., 2000, Vasilopulos et al., 2006, Gow et al., 2009, Queen et al., 2012, Sabshin et al., 2012, Paris et al., 2014, Silva and Lobato, 2015).",

However, no such population-level guidelines are available to help shelter managers mitigate the animal and public health risks of enteropathogens. Guidelines developed for care of individually owned cats can be impractical in animal welfare organizations due to limited funding, staffing, and technical expertise. In the absence of expert guidance, shelter managers must devise their own preventive health programs, often in the absence of veterinary input or knowledge of the most important enteropathogens in their specific facilities.",

When available, the following information was collected on each cat: responsible agency, identification name or number, intake date, estimated age, and sex. In group-housed cats sharing a communal litter box, a single sample was collected and some animal-specific information (e.g., age and sex) was recorded as unknown. In addition, age and sex information was missing from some cats in TNR programs when feces were collected from their traps after the cats were removed for surgery.

To avoid cross-contamination of samples, each was collected with a separate set of supplies, including a glove assisted by a wooden tongue depressor or syringe, as needed. Trained study staff collected all samples from STS, LTS, and TNR cats. Foster care programs were provided with a written protocol and supplies to collect fecal samples in the home, and then meet the study personnel at a central location for examination of their cats and packaging of samples. For each sample, two fecal aliquots were collected into new plastic screw-top jars. One jar was selected for PCR assay and placed into its own zipper-lock plastic bag to further reduce the chance of cross-contamination. The second jar was designated for fecal flotation. Samples were transported in a Styrofoam cooler with ice packs and stored at 4 \u00b0C in a refrigerator pending analysis.",

Routine surveillance of pathogens within the sanctuary should be performed at regular intervals and control protocols revised as needed. On a practical level, this is unlikely to be feasible, since many sanctuaries are under-resourced, lack veterinary oversight, and frequently operate beyond their capacity to ensure the health of the cats and the people who care for them (Polak et al., 2014). In addition, many enteropathogens are only intermittently shed in sufficient amounts to be detected by diagnostic tests, thus risking introduction by cats with undetected infections (Mekaru et al., 2007, Little et al., 2015), and curative treatments are lacking for many enteropathogens. For managing feline and public health risks, cats adopted out of sanctuaries should have complete health examinations after adoption, and those transferred to other agencies should be segregated from other cats.",

Although the pathogens evaluated in this study can be associated with gastrointestinal disease, it is apparent that the mere presence of these agents does not consistently result in diarrhea. Additional co-factors, such as co-infections, stress, immune status, general body condition, genetics, pathogen virulence, and pathogen burden may play a role in the development of disease. Clinicians should proceed cautiously when attributing diarrhea to any detected pathogen, since a majority of cats had one or more pathogens identified regardless of their health status.",

The use of personal protective equipment during sanitation procedures, frequent handwashing after handling cats, selection of premise disinfectants effective against common pathogens, installation of impermeable surfaces to facilitate cleaning, and frequent sanitation of litterboxes are recommended standards of practice (Newbury et al., 2010). Anthelmintics and treatment for external parasites should be routinely administered to all cats according to established guidelines1\n(Smith et al., 2009, Little et al., 2015). Intake protocols that include routine treatments against coccidia (Litster et al., 2014), tapeworms, and fleas (which can transmit tapeworms) in endemic regions can be more practical and cost-effective than individualized testing and treatment. Treatments against some common enteropathogens, such as T. foetus, Cryptosporidium spp., and Giardia spp., are often impractical in large populations, or in the case of FCoV, do not exist (Addie et al., 2009). Such infections can be difficult to eradicate once introduced into a population. Although guidelines exist for minimizing the risk of zoonotic transmission from individual cats, particularly to immunocompromised individuals (Tuzio et al., 2005), no such guidelines exist for large cat populations. Fortunately, the strains of Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia spp. carried by cats are generally of low zoonotic potential (Palmer et al., 2008, Thompson et al., 2008).",

Therefore, it was not possible to assure that the sampled cats were similar to cats not sampled, and caution should be used when extrapolating the results to broader populations. Since fecal samples were intentionally collected such that approximately half were diarrhea and half were of normal consistency, the overall prevalence of diarrhea and enteropathogens in each sheltering model was not determined. Most of the cats with positive FPV tests had been recently vaccinated, and it is possible that the PCR test detected the vaccine virus rather than natural infection (Truyen et al., 2009). Cats were tested only once, whereas many pathogens have variable rates of fecal shedding that may fall below the limit of detection (Mekaru et al., 2007, Little et al., 2015). In addition, the pathogen screening panel used in this study did not include all enteropathogens associated with diarrhea in cats, such as rotavirus (Martella et al., 2010, German et al., 2015, Otto et al., 2015), calicivirus (Castro et al., 2015), and astrovirus (Ng et al., 2014). It is likely that more enteropathogens will be associated with gastrointestinal disease in cats as they continue to be evaluated (Ng et al., 2014).",

Practical options for control are limited by the diverse scope of enteropathogens, expense and limitations of diagnostic tests, lack of curative treatment options for many organisms, co-mingling of cats, and prolonged shedding and environmental persistence of some organisms. In light of the widespread presence of enteropathogens, risk-management strategies should be implemented to reduce transmission to people and other animals. These should focus on establishing high standards for housing and sanitation, routine administration of anthelmintics, compliance with preventive care guidelines, periodic surveillance, response to specific enteropathogen patterns, humane population management of free-roaming community cats, public health education, and most importantly, minimizing the duration and number of cats in mass confinement.",
