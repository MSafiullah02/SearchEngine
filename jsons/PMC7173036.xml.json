They bear on their surface oligomers of a fusion protein, often part of a polypeptide that performs other functions, such as receptor binding. Most viral fusion proteins require priming by proteolytic processing, either of the fusion protein itself or of an accompanying protein. The priming step, which often occurs during transport of the fusion protein to the cell surface but may also occur extracellularly, then prepares the fusion protein for triggering by events that accompany attachment and uptake. For example, proton binding is frequently such a trigger, which provides the virus with a mechanism for detecting that it has arrived in the low\u2010pH milieu of an endosome.",

            "text": "The bilayer fusion reaction common to all the enveloped viral entry pathways is shown schematically in Fig. 1\n(for a review, see Cohen et al., 2002). It is believed to pass through an intermediate known as a \u201chemifusion stalk\u201d (Fig. 1B) (Markin 1984, Siegel 1993). In this intermediate, the two apposed leaflets have fused, but not the distal ones. Hemifused bilayers can proceed to form a \u201cfusion pore\u201d (Fig. 1D) or form a structure in which the two distal leaflets create a single bilayer. This state, which can spread laterally, is called a \u201chemifusion diaphragm\u201d (Fig. 1E). Bilayers do not fuse spontaneously (e.g., concentrated liposomes are quite stable), because the reaction in Fig. 1 has a high activation barrier, both at the step between the precursor bilayers and the hemifusion stalk and at the step between the hemifusion stalk and the fusion pore. A newly opened pore appears to revert frequently to a hemifusion structure (\u201cflickering\u201d), and the largest kinetic barrier may be for the step in which the pore dilates rather than reverts. Once the fusion pore has dilated, the fused stucture is stable with respect to the initial, unfused structure.",

Receptor binding does not induce any significant conformational changes in HA. It merely attaches the virus to the cell surface and allows capture by endocytic vesicles. The trigger for a fusion\u2010inducing conformational change is the binding of one or more protons, as the pH of the endosome becomes progressively lower. Most strains of influenza A have a critical pH of about 5\u20135.5, corresponding to the pH of a relatively late endosomal compartment. No particular titrating residue accounts for the transition; rather, when the charge on the protein destabilizes it sufficiently, a cooperative conformational rearrangement ensues (Daniels et al., 1985).",

(1) The HA1 receptor\u2010binding domains separate from each other. Because HA1 is linked to HA2 by a disulfide bond, it cannot dissociate completely, but the final conformation of HA2 requires that HA1 move away from the threefold axis to allow HA2 to form new threefold contacts. (2) HA2 straightens by a loop\u2010to\u2010helix transition of a segment previously tucked beneath HA1 (Bullough 1994, Carr 1993). This rearrangement thrusts the N\u2010terminal fusion peptide up (using the coordinates of Fig. 2 as a reference for \u201cup\u201d and \u201cdown\u201d), where it can encounter the membrane of the target cell. The extended intermediate, with fusion peptides inserted into the target cell membrane, may have a lifetime of seconds to minutes. (3) The long helix of HA2 breaks and reverses direction, and the distal part of the HA2 chain zips up along the stem formed by long central helix, which now runs from the fusion peptide to the breakpoint. In its final conformation, the HA2 ectodomain has its N terminus, which bears the fusion peptide, adjacent to its C terminus, which leads to the transmembrane anchor (Chen et al., 1999). In other words, the two membrane\u2010interacting segments on each chain are next to each other. Thus, assuming that all three fusion peptides insert into the target membrane and that the C\u2010terminal transmembrane segments remain anchored in the viral membrane, the zipping up of the distal part of HA2 will drag the two membranes together (Fig. 3).",

            "text": "Only the inital (Fig. 2B) and final (Fig. 2C) conformations of HA2 can be studied easily by structural methods. Evidence for the pathway described previously and shown diagrammatically in Fig. 3 comes from biophysical studies of HA\u2010mediated fusion and from the effects of various mutations on the fusion process (reviewed extensively elsewhere and outlined only in summary here).1\nThe low\u2010pH trigger. The threshold pH for fusion can be affected by a variety of amino acid substitutions, and some that increase the threshold pH can be selected by isolating virus resistant to amantadine (which raises the pH of endosomes). These mutations map in a variety of locations, which have in common that they appear to contribute to interactions that hold together the HA trimer (Daniels et al., 1985). Thus, there appears not to be a single, localized trigger, but rather a cumulative effect of various groups that bind protons at pH 5 and above.2\nFusion peptide emergence and insertion. The amino acid sequence of the loop in HA2 has a particularly strong helical coiled\u2010coil signature, and peptides with this sequence form stable coiled coils in solution (Carr and Kim, 1993). Release of the constraints imposed on the conformation of this peptide by HA1 is therefore likely to lead to coiled\u2010coil formation and translocation of the fusion peptide away from the base of the trimer. The phrase \u201cspring\u2010loaded\u201d has been used to describe this mechanism (Carr and Kim, 1993). Experiments with target membranes containing photoactivatable cross\u2010linking reagents demonstrate insertion of the fusion peptide into the target cell membrane, probably before fusion (Tsurudome et al., 1992). A peptide having the amino acid sequence of the first 20 residues of HA2 forms a gently kinked, amphipathic helix in the presence of detergent micelles (Han et al., 2001). On a membrane, this structure would lie partially embedded in the outer monolayer, with the two ends dipping somewhat more deeply into the bilayer outer leaflet than the apex of the kink. That is, the fusion peptide probably inserts only into the proximal leaflet of a membrane lipid bilayer. The effects of mutations in the fusion peptide vary with position (Qiao 1999, Steinhauer 1995). They do not correlate in any simple way with the structure just described, but it may be difficult to deconvolute the requirements for its conformation in the mature HA1\u2013HA2 trimer from those for productive membrane insertion.3\nFold\u2010back. The best evidence for an extended \u201cprefusion intermediate,\u201d with the fusion peptides inserted into the target cell membrane but with the C\u2010terminal parts of the fusion protein still at the opposite end of the molecule, comes from work on HIV\u20101 gp41 (Furuta 1998, Rimsky 1998) (see later). In the mature HA trimer at neutral pH, the long axial helices diverge from each other at about the position at which the folding back occurs (Fig. 2B,C), and it is plausible that in the extended intermediate, the \u201clower\u201d part of the molecule is unstable and locally unfolded. There has been some confusion in the literature about the folding back process. Although the expressions \u201cfold back\u201d and \u201cjack\u2010knifing\u201d have been used to describe the conformational change, the only way it can plausibly occur in practice is by melting at least some of the C\u2010terminal segments of the HA2 ectodomain and zipping up these segments along the central core (Fig. 3). If the links between the fusion peptides and the central core are flexible, then the zipping process will necessarily displace the position of the chain reversal (the fold\u2010back point) laterally, away from the constriction. During the transition from the extended intermediate to the folded\u2010back conformation, threefold symmetry is broken; it is restored only in the final, postfusion structure.The free energy required to deform the two membranes, squeeze them together, and initiate fusion is probably more than can be obtained from refolding of a single trimer, and it is likely that several HA trimers cooperate to form a fusion pore. Evidence for this statement includes the observation that the lag time between acidification and fusion of cells expressing HA on their plasma membranes depends on the HA surface density (Danieli et al., 1996). One picture for the process would invoke formation of a structurally defined ring of extended intermediates, surrounding the position at which fusion will occur. An alternative, more stochastic model, is also possible, as described in more detail later, in Section IV.A.4\nHemifusion. The fold\u2010back step brings the two membranes close together. Are there further structural features that accelerate hemifusion? Distortion of one or both membranes by introduction of positive curvature would be one way to do so; stabilization of a hemifusion stalk once formed, thereby preventing reversal, would be another. We need to know more about the conformation and properties of an inserted fusion peptide before we can assess these possibilities. The discovery, that class II fusion peptides insert only into the outer part of the target membrane, suggests a possible mechanism for hemifusion stalk stabilization (see later).5\nFusion pore formation. A noteworthy feature of the rearranged structure of HA2 ectodomain is a tight \u201ccap,\u201d formed by the way the C\u2010terminal part of the polypeptide chain associates with the N\u2010terminal end of the central, three\u2010helix bundle (Fig. 2C) (Chen et al., 1999). This cap is likely to snap the folded\u2010back conformation into place. In the model for the fusion reaction diagrammed in Fig. 3, the final step involves stabilization of the fusion pore by interposition of the transmembrane anchors of HA2. Formation of the HA2 cap may be a critical feature of this step. When HA is linked to a glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor or to a truncated transmembrane anchor that does not cross the bilayer, it catalyzes hemifusion quite readily, but it promotes fusion poorly, if at all (Kemble 1994, Melikyan 1995). Catalyzing fusion does not require a specific structure or amino acid sequence on the inside of the membrane; the transmembrane anchor must simply traverse the bilayer completely (Armstrong et al., 2000). Truncation of the SV5 fusion protein produces a similar result (Dutch and Lamb, 2001). Snapping the HA2 cap into place and dragging the cytosolic end of the transmembrane anchor into a newly opened pore will prevent the pore from resealing (which it will otherwise tend to do) and force the fusion reaction to proceed to completion.\n",

With the exception of the added esterase module, the protein is recognizably similar to the HA of influenza A (Rosenthal et al., 1998) (Fig. 4\n). The esterase domain resembles in structure other acetyl hydrolases. In the amino acid sequence, it falls in two parts\u2014one at the N\u2010terminal end of the sialic acid\u2010binding domain and the other at the C\u2010terminal end. That is, the receptor\u2010binding domain is an insert into the esterase, which in turn is an insert between the N\u2010 and C\u2010terminal segments of HEF1. One can thus imagine that the N\u2010 and C\u2010terminal segments of HEF1 (or HA1) and the entirety of HEF2 (or HA2) constitute an elementary fusion module, into which other functions have been inserted in the course of evolution (Rosenthal 1998, Skehel 2000).",

The two fragments, gp120 and gp41, remain associated noncovalently, but the contact is relatively weak, and gp120 tends to dissociate (\u201cshed\u201d) from mature virions (Moore et al., 1990).",

Rather, infection of suitable cell types is determined by a requirement for both a primary receptor, CD4 (Dalgleish et al., 1984), and a coreceptor, one of several members of the chemokine receptor family (Feng et al., 1996). Binding of CD4 induces a conformational change in gp120/gp41, detected by altered antigenic properties, enhanced proteolytic sensitivity of the gp120 moiety, and enhanced shedding (Sattentau 1991, Sattentau 1993). The change increases affinity of gp120/gp41 for the coreceptor, probably by organizing the site for coreceptor binding (Trkola 1996, Wu 1996). Coreceptor attachment leads to fusion, probably because the coreceptor induces gp120 dissociation, fusion peptide exposure, and gp41 refolding (Chan 1997, Weissenhorn 1997). The diagram in Fig. 5\nsummarizes current thinking.",

Both structures correspond to postfusion states (or at least to posttriggering states). Both structures are also of molecules truncated in important ways to facilitate structural studies. Thus, the gp120 \u201ccore\u201d that has been crystallized (in complex with CD4 and the Fab from mAb 17b) is simply the receptor\u2010 and coreceptor\u2010binding element, stripped of nonessential variable loops and lacking N\u2010 and C\u2010terminal segments. These terminal segments of gp120 can be thought of as part of the basic fusion module, by analogy with influenza A HA and influenza C HEF (Pollard et al., 1992) (Fig. 6\n). The soluble form of the gp41 ectodomain (Blacklow 1995, Lu 1995), studied in several crystal forms (Chan 1997, Tan 1997, Weissenhorn 1997) and also by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (Caffrey et al., 1998), lacks the first 30 residues of gp41, that is (the fusion peptide plus some residues that follow it) and (in most cases) a loop in the middle.",

The rearrangements in gp120 that initiate the process are probably quite extensive (Myszka et al., 2000). The receptor\u2010binding core folds into two domains, termed \u201cinner\u201d and \u201couter\u201d (Fig. 7). One hairpin loop from each of these domains contributes to the \u201cbridging sheet,\u201d a \u03b2 sheet that locks the relative positions and orientations of the two domains and that creates the site for coreceptor interaction. It has been suggested that the bridging sheet is not present before encounter with CD4 and that receptor binding locks the sheet into place (Kwong et al., 1998). The inner and outer domains could thus have quite different relative orientations in the precursor conformation. The inner domain contains both N and C termini of the gp120 core. They are essentially adjacent to each other in the structure, consistent with the notion that the receptor-binding element is an insert into an elementary fusion module (compare with Fig. 4).",

The N-terminal helices of each hairpin cluster into a three\u2010helix coiled coil, forming the inner core of the rearranged gp41. The fusion peptides project from the N\u2010terminal end of this inner core. The C-terminal helix of each hairpin runs along the outside of the core, so that the transmembrane anchor at which it terminates lies adjacent to a fusion peptide. Although missing from the crystal structures, the loop between inner core helix and outer layer helix probably has a structure that resembles the conformation seen in fragments of the fusion proteins from Moloney murine leukemia virus (Fass et al., 1996) and Ebola virus (Weissenhorn et al., 1998), both of which have a conserved disulfide bond in this region, in common with HIV and SIV Env.",

Evidence for the properties of this intermediate comes from kinetic studies, in which binding of outer layer\u2010derived peptides has been analyzed by detecting their effects on fusion (Furuta 1998, Jones 1998, Munoz\u2010Barroso 1999). The intermediate has a measurable lifetime. For example, in cell\u2013cell fusion assays, conformational changes in gp120/gp41 begin within 1 min of mixing donor and target cells, but a peptide corresponding to residues in the outer layer helix inhibits fusion even if added 15 min later (Munoz\u2010Barroso et al., 1999). Two classes of outer layer peptide have been studied. One includes residues in the stretch just preceding the transmembrane segment (e.g., DP178/T\u201020/enfuvirtide, now a licensed antiretroviral drug [Kilby 2003, Wild 1994]). The other includes residues toward the N terminus of the outer layer helix (e.g., a peptide called C34; Chan et al., 1998). These two classes may block fusion at slightly different stages. There is some evidence that C34\u2010like peptides block both hemifusion (lipid mixing) and full fusion (content mixing), whereas T\u201020\u2010like peptides block only the latter (Kliger et al., 2001). Figure 3 is consistent with this difference. According to Fig. 3, early stages in zipping up the outer layer, blocked by C34, would be required to bring together the two membranes and hence for the initial hemifusion step; later stages would probably be required primarily to complete the process and to lock the open fusion pore in place.",

The inner core is quite insoluble, and a more efficient way to study this mode of inhibition is to cover two of its three grooves with outer layer peptides, allowing one groove free to capture an outer layer segment from gp41 as it refolds. A single\u2010chain version of such a structure (in which three inner layer segments, interspersed with two outer layer segments, have been concatenated with suitable short linkers) is indeed an effective inhibitor of gp41\u2010mediated fusion and of HIV\u20101 infectivity (Root et al., 2001).",

A central, \u03b2\u2010sandwich domain (domain I) organizes its folded structure (Fig. 9B) (Modis 2003, Rey 1995). Two long and elaborate loops, stabilized by disulfide bridges, emanate from this central domain, forming a distinct subdomain termed domain II. At the tip of domain II is a hydrophobic sequence, identified from its conservation among all flaviviruses as the fusion loop (Allison et al., 2001). A third domain (domain III) follows the others in the polypeptide\u2010chain sequence; it has an immunoglobulin\u2010like fold, and various lines of evidence indicate that it binds receptors (at least in the case of several, well\u2010studied flaviviruses). Between domain III and the transmembrane anchor are about 50 amino acid residues\u2014a segment that has been called the \u201cstem\u201d (Allison et al., 1999). Although not a part of the protein that crystallizes, its conformation on the virion has been deduced from cryo\u2010EM image reconstructions. It is a pair of \u03b1 helices with an intervening loop, sandwiched between the main part of the E protein and the outer surface of the lipid bilayer (W. Zhang et al., 2003). The transmembrane anchor is also a helical hairpin, as the virus relies on signal protease (in the endoplasmic reticulum [ER] lumen) to cleave E from a precursor polyprotein.",

The fusion loop at the tip of domain II lies at the dimer interface, sequestered from potential membrane insertions until lowered pH triggers rearrangement (Rey et al., 1995). On the immature virion, E and prM form heterodimers, which in turn form somewhat asymmetric trimer clusters, and prM (rather than another E) appears to protect the fusion loop from exposure (Y. Zhang et al., 2003). Cleavage of prM releases all but 40 ectodomain residues, leading to dimerization of E and formation of the tightly packed surface array (Heinz et al., 1994).",

            "text": "When exposed to lowered pH, E rearranges yet again into trimers (Allison et al., 1995). The rearranged, presumably postfusion, structure of sE has been determined [for dengue virus type 2 (Modis et al., 2004) and for TBE virus (Bressanelli et al., 2004)] by taking advantage of the observation that sE dissociates reversibly to monomers in solution at low pH, but trimerizes irreversibly if liposomes are present (Stiasny et al., 2002). The conformational change involves reorientations of the three domains with respect to each other and probably an extension of the stem (not present in the sE trimer that crystallizes; Fig. 9C). The clustered domains II present their fusion loops at one end of the trimer. The loops themselves have essentially the same conformation as they do in the prefusion dimer, and the extent of their joint hydrophobic surface leads to the conclusion that they probably interact only with the outer leaflet of the target membrane bilayer and that they can dip by no more than 5 to 10\u2010\u00c5 into its hydrophobic region. The reorientation of domain II with respect to domain I is a rotation of about 20\u00b0. The reorientation of domain III is substantially greater; it flips over in such a way that its C terminus now projects back toward the fusion loops. The structure leads directly to the proposal that in the fusion rearrangement of intact E, the three stems extend along the lateral faces of the clustered domains II, forcing the C\u2010terminal transmembrane segments to approach the fusion loops. This feature of the conformational transition accomplishes essentially the same result as the fold\u2010back of class I viral fusion proteins: it brings together the two membrane\u2010associated parts of the protein and thus can cause the target cell membrane, into which the fusion loops are presumably inserted, to approach the viral membrane, into which the transmembrane anchor penetrates (Fig. 10\n).",

One follows from the analogy with class I viral fusion and the approach embodied in the development of T\u201020/enfuvirtide: use of a peptide containing sequences derived from the stem. Provided that the stem interacts as strongly with the threefold clustered domains II as the outer layer helices of gp41 interact with the trimeric core, then stem\u2010derived peptides would be expected to frustrate the zipping\u2010up step (Fig. 10D), just as T\u201020 or C34 frustrate the zipping up of gp41. A second strategy follows from the observation that a detergent molecule can occupy the hydrophobic pocket at the domain I\u2013domain II interface (Modis et al., 2003). This pocket disappears during the fusion rearrangement, so small molecules that lodge there would probably retard refolding.",

The lipid requirements are the same as those for fusion of intact virions: the target membrane must contain cholesterol and sphingolipid. Electron microscopy of liposomes with inserted E1 or E1* gives similar pictures: arrays of uniform trimers (Gibbons et al., 2003). Thus, the presence of the C\u2010terminal transmembrane anchor does not affect the way the fusion loops insert into the membrane. In the absence of a liposome bilayer into which to insert, E1* remains monomeric at lowered pH, like flavivirus sE. In both cases, the bilayer catalyzes the trimeric association, presumably by concentrating the monomers and organizing them in essentially parallel orientations. The irreversibility of the monomer\u2010to\u2010trimer transition probably resides in both cases in local \u03b2\u2010sheet reogranizations at the two interdomain boundaries.",

Why cholesterol should be necessary for membrane insertion of the SFV fusion loop is not immediately evident from the structure.

            "text": "We can outline five steps in the class II fusion process that parallel the five steps described previously for class I fusion by influenza virus HA.1\nThe low\u2010pH trigger. Mutations that alter the threshold pH for flavivirus fusion cluster around a hydrophobic pocket at the hinge between domains I and II (Modis et al., 2003). A nonionic detergent molecule inserts into this pocket when crystals of DEN\u20102 sE are grown in its presence. Several of these mutations change the size of hydrophobic side chains, suggesting that their effect is on the free energy cost of altering the domain I\u2013domain II hinge position, rather than on the pK of a titrating residue. Candidates for proton\u2010binding residues are two conserved histidines at the domain I\u2013domain III interface in the prefusion dimer (Bressanelli et al., 2004). One might expect protonation of these histidines to destabilize that interface, inducing dissociation of the dimer as domain III swings away both from its own domain I and from the fusion loop region of the other subunit.2\nFusion loop emergence and insertion. Unlike class I fusion peptides, which when exposed cause the fusion protein to aggregate (e.g., into \u201crosettes\u201d), class II fusion loops appear to be relatively stable when exposed to an aqueous environment. Flavivirus sE fragments dissociate reversibly at low pH in the absence of liposomes, and the SFV E1 ectodomain monomer crystallizes without any special protection for its fusion loop. Even three clustered fusion loops, as in the DEN\u20102 sE trimer, do not seem to bind a detergent micelle (Modis et al., 2004). Nonetheless, they clearly insert stably into bilayers, as seen directly by electron microscopy for SFV E1 ectodomain, DEN\u20102 sE, and tick\u2010borne encephalitis (TBE) sE (Gibbons 2003, Modis 2004, Stiasny 2004). Although the insertion has not been visualized at high resolution, we can infer by comparing the high\u2010resolution structures with images from negative\u2010stain electron microscopy that the fusion loops penetrate only a short distance into the outer bilayer leaflet. Conserved tryptophans in the loops may lodge at the polar group\u2013hydrocarbon interface, as frequently found in integral membrane proteins.3\nFold\u2010back. Class I fusion proteins are generally trimers both before and after the fusion transition, but trimerization is actually part of the transition in the class II proteins. The structures suggest that the finger\u2010like domains II might initiate the trimer cluster, which could then lock in place as each monomer reverses on itself. The stem segments are likely to be quite flexible, and the description we gave of class I folding back as first a melting out (of the C\u2010terminal part of HA2) and then a zipping up probably applies to class II proteins as well. In this case, the melted\u2010out part would be the stem. Even if the two \u03b1\u2010helical segments of the flavivirus stem retained their secondary structure during the refolding, the stem could still extend to nearly 100 \u00c5 in length, giving more than enough slack for the process diagrammed in Fig. 10D,E.4\nHemifusion. As stated earlier, fusion proteins could catalyze the hemifusion step by promoting appropriate membrane curvature or by stabilizing the hemifusion intermediate (or both). Insertion of the fusion loops only into the outer bilayer leaflet will indeed produce some degree of positive curvature in the target membrane. A simple area calculation suggests, however, that it would take a relatively large number of trimers\u2014more than are likely to contribute to one fusion event\u2014to produce the degree of curvature pictured in some theoretical models of hemifusion (see, e.g., Kuzmin et al., 2001). A more important consequence of the limited insertion may be the possibility for the fusion loops to migrate into the hemifusion stalk itself, thereby stabilizing the stalk and preventing its reveral (fission). This notion is attractive for two reasons. First, it depends on a general property of the fusion segment (limited insertion), and it could apply to class I fusion mechanisms as well. Second, it explains the observation of stable hemifusion (so far, for class I fusion only) when proceeding to full fusion is substantially retarded. This proposed incorporation of fusion loops into the hemifusion stalk is included in the the diagram in Fig. 10.5\nFusion pore formation. Finishing the refolding steps, by bringing the transmembrane segments back onto the threefold axis of the protein trimer, can also lock a fusion pore into place, provided that the fusion loops have not migrated through the hemifusion stalk and into the viral membrane. At its waist, the curvature of the stalk (as seen from outside the cell by the fusion protein) is positive, and the fusion loops would be expected to stabilize it and perhaps to influence its geometry. Conversely, migration of fusion loops into a hemifusion stalk would be energetically favorable, holding them there until the opening of a pore. These proposals all require testing: the structural data available so far show only the initial and final states of the fusion process.\n",

The prefusion intermediate (Fig 3, Fig 10) presumably flickers toward the zipped\u2010up conformation but proceeds along that direction only when it meets a low enough barrier. If squeezing the two membranes together requires more than one trimer\u2014that is, if the resistance of the membranes to deformation counteracts the tendency of a single extended intermediate to collapse by zipping up into the folded\u2010back structure\u2014then only when several trimers proceed toward the zipped\u2010up conformation in concert will the refolding proceed. In this view, cooperativity is achieved not by defined protein\u2013protein interactions (ring formation), but rather by coupling through the elastic properties of the membranes undergoing fusion. A hemifusion stalk might be generated by as few as one or two trimers or by as many as can fit around the stalk (probably five or six), depending on circumstances, concentrations, and of course the actual free energy recovery from a single trimer. One advantage of this picture is that it does not require additional protein\u2013protein contacts between necessarily flickering and partly disordered intermediate structures.",

Class II proteins assemble as heterodimers with a protector protein. Cleavage of the latter is the priming event, and the fusion\u2010inducing rearrangement includes trimer formation. The class II proteins studied so far are clearly homologs. The same is not so evident for the class I proteins. Those of the lentiviruses, oncoretroviruses, and filoviruses have some apparent evolutionary kinship, but how they relate to influenza HA (for example) is less obvious. In any case, it is unlikely that the categories just defined exhaust the possible structural solutions to the problem of promoting bilayer fusion. It is probable, however, that fusion proteins of classes yet to be discovered will resemble the ones we know already in how they actually fuse membranes. That is, we can expect them to work through the sequence of fusion peptide exposure, fusion peptide insertion, and overall folding back that we have already analyzed in detail.",

An outer layer peptide from Ebola virus fusion protein GP2 blocks entry of VSV pseudotyped with Ebola virus glycoprotein GP1\u2013GP2 (Watanabe et al., 2000). Thus, HIV gp41 is not unique in having an outer layer that binds tightly enough to work as an inhbitor in trans. The cyclic peptide that targets a pocket on the inner core of the HIV gp41 trimer has a footprint not much larger than that of a more conventional drug, so even the zipping\u2010up phase of the refolding reaction might be susceptible to small molecule inhibitors. Because HIV fuses at the cell surface, the gp41 fusion transition is more likely to be accessible to a peptide than that of a protein that refolds in an endosome. Small molecules that can penetrate to low\u2010pH compartments may therefore be necessary if the principle demonstrated by the successful use of T\u201020/enfuvirtide is to be applied to the entry of many other viral pathogens.",
