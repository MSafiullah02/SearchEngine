Up to now, many viruses have been identified as the main cause of acute respiratory infections, such as respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, coronavirus, and adenovirus. However, a rather high percentage of acute respiratory infections still remains unknown the etiology. In recent years, several newly discovered viruses were reported to have association with respiratory infections, including human bocavirus (HBoV) [Mahony, 2008] .",

The genome contains three open reading frames encoding two non-structural proteins, NS1 and NP1, as well as two structural capsid proteins, VP1 and VP2. Up to now, four species of HBoV have been identified, namely HBoV1, HBoV2, HBoV3, and HBoV4. HBoV1 is predominantly detected in respiratory samples. On the contrary, HBoV2-4 have been found mainly in stool samples [Jartti et al., 2012] .",

HBoV was mainly found in children with acute respiratory infections at the rate ranging from 1.5% to 19% [Malecki et al., 2011; Jartti et al., 2012] , indicating that HBoV is the third most common respiratory virus, after respiratory syncytial virus and human rhinovirus. However, in many epidemiological studies, HBoV was co-detected frequently with other respiratory pathogens, as well as often seen in asymptomatic children, which raising the question about its causality. Despite of that, recent identification of HBoV in blood samples together with advances in serodiagnosis have provided the increasing evidence for a causal role of HBoV in respiratory illness [Jartti et al., 2012] . Most of the published studies so far emphasized on the prevalence and epidemiology of HBoV. Only a few reports provided data related to clinical characteristics of HBoV infection. Also, the epidemiology of respiratory viruses seems to have the geographic and temporal characteristics.",

This rate is in accordance with previously published rates, ranging from 1.5% to 19% [Jartti et al., 2012] . The discrepancy observed in the incidence of HBoV infection between these studies may be explained by the differences in study design affecting age, recruitment criteria, study settings, study periods; the differences between hospital-based and community-based study; the differences in clinical specimen examination, diagnostic methods with different sensitivity and specificity, or regional and temporal differences. In this study, HBoV was the third most common respiratory agent after rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus, and it was more frequent than infections with influenza A, B, and parainfluenza viruses. Since the evidence of HBoV as a true respiratory pathogen becomes more convincing [Allander et al., 2005; Schildgen et al., 2008; Schildgen, 2010] , the high detection rate implies that HBoV is responsible for a large burden of illness in young children with regard to health care utilization.",

            "text": "Regarding the season, although HBoV was detected throughout the year, its peak was in the dry season from December to April of this tropical area. However, no consistent seasonal distribution of HBoV was found in many previous reports. Most studies demonstrated that HBoV infection occurred year round with high prevalence in the winter and spring [Allander et al., 2005; Kesebir et al., 2006; Weissbrich et al., 2006; Lau et al., 2007; Pozo et al., 2007] , while some other reports showed the increased HBoV infections in late spring and early summer [Choi et al., 2006; Ma et al., 2006 ]. On the other hand, some authors did not observe the obvious seasonal activity of HBoV [Bastien et al., 2006; Maggi et al., 2007; Zheng et al., 2010] . Since this study spanned for about 1 year, in order to get a clear view on seasonality of HBoV infection, the continuing surveillance is necessary. HBoV can be found in respiratory samples of all ages, but mainly in young children. In this study, the ages of HBoV-positive children ranged from 1 to 62 months, indicating that children over 5 years old were rarely infected with HBoV. The age group with the lowest infection rate was children younger than Fig. 3 . Phylogenetic analysis of the partial VP1 nucleotide sequences of HBoVs. Phylogenetic tree was constructed with MEGA 5 software using the neighbor-joining method. Bootstrap values of greater than 70% are shown at the branch nodes. The HBoV strains in this study are marked with solid round. Prototype strain ST1 and ST2 (in bold face) were also included. Number of identical strains is indicated in the parentheses. The species assignment is indicated by the brackets on the right. 6 months (5%). In contrast, the infection rate was highest among children 12-23 months (9.8%), the age at which most children have lost the maternal antibody protection, and decreased with the increasing age. These phenomena imply that maternal antibody against HBoV may protect the children during early infancy, and then, the immunity acquired from primary HBoV infection during early childhood may protect the children from getting later infection. The serological study in Japan revealed that nearly all individuals were seropositive for HBoV by the age of 5 years, and the seropositive rate was lowest in infants aged from 6 to 8 months and gradually increased with age [Endo et al., 2007] .",

Therefore, it is impossible to differentiate clinically the respiratory infections caused by HBoV and other pathogens. However, in this study some clinical features, which were distinct for HBoV infection were also observed. Hypoxia was seen more often among children with HBoV-positive than those with HBoV-negative, which may lead to longer hospitalization duration. Moriyama et al. [2010] also observed that hypoxia was more severe in HBoV-positive patients than in RSVpositive ones. In this study, half of HBoV-positive patients were diagnosed as pneumonia. The existing literatures, in which HBoV infection was confirmed by serum PCR or serodiagnosis, also noted the significant association between HBoV infection and pneumonia [Fry et al., 2007; Christensen et al., 2010; Don et al., 2010; Karalar et al., 2010] .",

            "text": "Co-detection of HBoV with other respiratory pathogens was found frequently, with the rate of up to 83% [Jartti et al., 2012] . However, HBoV viremia has been documented to be significantly more frequent in children with acute respiratory infections than in the control group, which supports the causative role of HBoV in respiratory diseases [Kesebir et al., 2006; Allander et al., 2007; Fry et al., 2007; Maggi et al., 2007] . In this study, 66.7% of children with HBoV-positive were co-infected with other viral pathogens. This result also confirmed that co-infection with other viruses was not an uncommon characteristic of HBoV. The overlapping seasonality of HBoV and other circulating viruses may explain for this phenomenon. Another explanation is the persistence, an interesting feature of HBoV [Jartti et al., 2012] . HBoV may persist in the airway rather long-lasting and the prolonged viral shedding may explain for the high co-detection rate observed in many studies. Unexpectedly, no correlation was found between co-infection and clinical symptoms. The rates of severe symptoms and lower respiratory tract infections did not increase in co-infection group. Co-infection of HBoV and other respiratory viruses did not increase the disease severity. A quantitative PCR analysis may be helpful to clarify the role of HBoV to the respiratory diseases when being detected alone or together with other viruses.",

The recent review summarized the current knowledge on HBoV infection demonstrated that HBoV1 is predominantly found in respiratory samples, while the rest of HBoV species, including HBoV2, HBoV3, and HBoV4, have been found mainly in human stool [Jartti et al., 2012] . However, two studies of children with acute respiratory infections in Korea [Han et al., 2009] and China reported that the enteric HBoV2 was also identified in nasopharyngeal samples. Recently, the research from Japan reported the identification of all four HBoV species in respiratory samples from children with respiratory tract infections [Koseki et al., 2012] . To determine whether all HBoV species are involved with respiratory diseases, the pan-bocavirus primers were used in this study. However, only HBoV1 was found in children with acute respiratory infections in Vietnam and is in line with the above review's findings [Jartti et al., 2012] . The geographical differences may explain for the different distribution of HBoV species worldwide. The absence of HBoV2-4 in this study suggests these viruses may not directly involve in respiratory illnesses. The sequence analysis also revealed that the circulating HBoVs were closely related to the original strains. Most polymorphisms identified in this study did not result in amino acid changes at the corresponding protein. The high similarity suggests that HBoV1 genes may be highly conserved, and serological tests should be universal application and interpretation worldwide.",
