It is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. Disease prevalence follows a geographic pattern based on the distribution of its primary vector, the Ixodes tick, and its mammalian life cycle hosts, the white-tailed deer and white-footed mouse [6]. Recent studies have concluded that climate change may have sizeable effects on its epidemiology [7\u2022\u2022, 8]. A 2018 study employed fixed effects analysis to examine the impact of climatic variables such as temperature and precipitation in 15 North American states with the highest incidence of Lyme disease. These results were used to project a greater than 20% increase in Lyme disease cases in the USA, assuming a mid-century 2 \u00b0C increase in temperature as predicted by the U.S. National Climate Assessment [8].",

Early localized disease manifests as erythema chronicum migrans otherwise known as a \u201cbull\u2019s eye rash\u201d due to the characteristic central clearing; however, this lesion may appear uniformly erythematous (see Fig. 1). If left untreated, this is followed by early disseminated disease, which typically causes inflammation of the heart and nervous systems. The most common cardiac presentation is an AV nodal heart block, although peri- and myocarditis may also occur [9]. The most common neurologic presentations are nerve palsies and meningitis [9]. Late disease, which occurs months to years after a tick bite, most commonly presents as mono- or polyarticular arthritis. Rarer manifestations of late disease comprise a variety of neurologic symptoms such as memory loss, pain, and paresthesias [5, 6, 9].",

This makes the possibility of co-infection a critical consideration, particularly for Lyme disease, because doxycycline is ineffective for treatment of babesiosis [14\u2022]. It is important to note that while concurrent infection with Lyme disease can increase the severity of the acute illness, complications arising from chronic Lyme disease are not affected by co-infection with babesiosis [14\u2022, 15]. There has also been a recent recognition of transfusion-transmission in the USA by the American Association of Blood Banks, which launched a risk-based decision-making assessment of \u201cBabesia donation testing\u201d intervention.

Although most cases of babesiosis in otherwise healthy individuals have a benign course, healthcare providers should be aware of risk of progression to fulminant disease. Multiple recent case studies have demonstrated significant morbidity and mortality from ARDS, hemolysis and thrombocytopenia, hypotension, and nosocomial infections [18, 19]. Splenic rupture is another severe complication of babesiosis, with a higher incidence in younger, healthy patients with a lower degree of parasitemia, possibly due to a strong immunologic splenic response to infection [20].",

The current gold standard diagnostic method is via indirect immunofluorescence antibody assay, which should always be performed using paired serum samples from acute and convalescent phases. It is important to note that single or inappropriately timed samples are easily misinterpreted and should be avoided. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a highly specific test; early stages of infection often test negative and treatment should not be withheld in clinically suspicious patients with negative PCR testing [26].",

Treatment should not be delayed until the appearance of a rash or other characteristic symptom in cases with a high clinical suspicion for RMSF. While the incidence of SFR continues to rise, mortality and morbidity have decreased since the mid-1900s due to the availability of tetracyclines and a recent push for early antibiotics in suspected cases [22, 27]. The leading predictor of fatality in RSMF is a delay in antibiotics. Doxycycline is the preferred antibiotic for all ages and regardless of pregnancy status [28]. For adults and children weighing over 45 kg, 100 mg should be administered twice daily either intravenously or orally. For children under 45 kg, the recommended doxycycline dose is 2.2 mg/kg/dose twice daily. Treatment should be continued for at least 3 days following resolution of fever, which can range from 42 h to 5 days depending on the severity of illness [29]. Doxycycline has been shown to prevent severe morbidity and mortality if given within 5 days of symptom onset [22, 29]. Despite this recommendation, as recently as 2014, only 35% of healthcare providers were willing to use doxycycline in suspected pediatric RMSF cases due to occurrences of dental staining caused by older generations of tetracyclines [30\u2022]. However, studies by the CDC and Indian Health Services failed to show any dental discoloration or enamel hypoplasia in children under 8 years of age who received short-term courses of doxycycline [31, 32].",

The disease is transmitted primarily through the bite of the black-legged tick (I. scapularis) and the western black-legged tick [37]. The black-legged tick is found throughout the eastern USA from Texas to North Dakota and the western black-legged tick is found along the west coast from Southern California to Washington State with extension as far east as Utah [37]. Most cases occur during the summer and late fall seasons with peaks in June/July and October/November. The number of reported cases has increased from 348 in 2000 to 5762 in 2017, and the number of states with cases has increased, corresponding to the increased range of the black-legged tick [38]. In 2017, 90% of reported cases occurred in eight states (Vermont, Maine, Rhode Island, Minnesota, Massachusetts, Wisconsin, New Hampshire, and New York) [38]. In addition to transmission by infected ticks, anaplasmosis has been transmitted through blood and organ transfusion [37].",

It was postulated that the syndrome is caused by transmission of Borrelia lonestari through the bite of the lone star tick (A. americanum) given the presence of this tick in these southern states. However, the bacteria have not been isolated from a human with STARI. Even positive PCR testing has been limited to one case [46]. In addition, testing of 31 patients with presumed STARI in Missouri failed to yield evidence of infection by B. lonestari so the cause of STARI remains unknown [48]. As with many ticks, the lone star tick\u2019s range has expanded, with the ticks found as far west as central Texas and as far North as Maine [49]. It will be interesting to see if the range of STARI cases expands as well.",

Older and immunocompromised patients are more likely to develop severe disease [68\u2022, 69].
