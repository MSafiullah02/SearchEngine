ACE2 gene expression in each pathological stage of LUAD was no different (F-val = 0.634, Fig. 1a); likewise, in LUSC, it was also no different (F-val = 0.589, Fig. 1b). TMPRSS2 gene expression in each pathological stage of LUAD showed obvious differences (F-val = 5.54, Fig. 1c), but in LUSC, it did not vary (F-val = 1.94, Fig. 1d). The data show that changes in the expression of these two genes had no statistical significance, which suggests that the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes are expressed consistently in each pathological stage of lung cancer, except for TMPRSS2 in LUAD. Furthermore, there are no significant differences in the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 among the pathological stages of LUAD and LUSC. TMPRSS2 maybe a cancer suppressor gene in LUAD, the downregulated expression level may decrease the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 for LUAD patients.\n",

We reported that the comparative gene expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in each subtype and pathological stages of two common lung cancers, LUAD and LUSC. Lung cancer patients in each age stage, subtype, and pathological stages are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, except for the primitive subtype of LUSC, and were verified by meta-analysis, gene expression omnibus (GEO) data and animal models results. Besides, TMPRSS2 maybe a cancer suppressor gene for it was severely downregulated in LUAD and LUSC and the mechanism was not reported yet.",
