Common symptoms reported in adults with COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, and fatigue; severe cases have been associated with dyspnoea and bilateral ground-glass opacities on chest CT.3 In China, the SARS-CoV-2 reproductive number is estimated at 2.6 The combined case-fatality rate is 2% in China,7 and the risk of death is increased significantly in older people (approximately 15%).7 It is noteworthy that infants and children have not been featured prominently in COVID-19 case statistics. An analysis from China has shown that children younger than 10 years account for only 1% of COVID-19 cases,7 similar to the proportion for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics.4, 5\n",

Case definitions and management strategies for children are absent because of the limited number of paediatric patients with COVID-19. In The Lancet Infectious Diseases, Haiyan Qiu and colleagues9 have shed light on this under-represented population with a clinical report of 36 paediatric patients (aged 1\u201316 years) with PCR-confirmed COVID-19. Their analyses have important implications for clinical management of younger people with SARS-CoV-2 infection and social distancing policies to prevent virus transmission.",

Although this work will assist with case identification, management, and social policy guidance, much more information is needed to establish the optimum management regimen. Specifically, the data showed that paediatric patients with COVID-19 had mild or asymptomatic disease accompanied by pneumonia in about half the cases.9 It is unclear which children should be targeted for antiviral and immunomodulatory treatment, particularly in view of the high proportion of asymptomatic infected contacts. Together, these results could suggest that children have specific mechanisms regulating the interaction between the immune system and respiratory machinery, which could be contributing to milder disease. Possibly, lung infiltrates have a protective role during paediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection, similar to lymphocytes participating in inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid structure development after respiratory insult.10 Correlation between chest radiography and CT findings might give additional insight into the clinical importance, if any, of the CT findings. In view of the substantial radiation exposure associated with CT, if children are only experiencing mild disease, routine use of CT might not be warranted and needs further assessment for the management of paediatric cases.",
