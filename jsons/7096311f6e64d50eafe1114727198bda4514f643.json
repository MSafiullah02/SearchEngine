The majority of the population lives in impoverished conditions with scarce access to health care resources, imposing significant challenges to a health care system organized to provide predominantly acute care. Diseases of the cardiovascular (CV) system became the leading cause of death in Brazil, followed by cancer and external causes, such as homicides and traffic accidents (1,2). Therefore, an urgent transformation in health care was needed. In this context, cardio-oncology in Brazil was developed as a specialty in 2010, when the Brazilian Societies of Cardiology and Oncology convened a group of 40 specialists to discuss what had become a Brazilian reality, acknowledging the increased prevalence of common risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer and the critical goal of improving health care for these patients. We developed the \"Brazilian Guidelines of Cardio-Oncology\" to enable and guide physicians and other health care professionals to prioritize the prevention, diagnosis, and management of CVD in cancer patients (3). The formation of the International Cardio-Oncology Society in 2009 further stimulated growth of this relatively new medical discipline in Brazil. Since then, we have initiated a productive international collaboration with countries such as the United States of America, Canada, and the United Kingdom, promoting international annual meetings in Brazil in the field of cardio-oncology. Cardio-oncology topics were included in the scientific program of the Brazilian medical meeting of Cardiology and of the Brazilian medical meeting of Oncology, events that brought together approximately 20,000 participants. Knowledge of cardio-oncology as an important medical discipline was furthered by the introduction of preceptorships, trainings, and courses.",

In addition, a specialized plan of care has been established in Brazil to safely care for cancer patients regarding CV risk and monitoring, with the goal of improving outcomes without risk (10). After 10 years of clinical practice in cardiooncology, the Brazilian Societies of Cardiology and Oncology define cardio-oncology as an evolving field of medicine, with the clear objectives of delivering the best care to cancer patients and preventing and managing CV complications based on the best available scientific evidence. In the near future, we hope to further deepen knowledge in cardio-oncology, applying the concepts of patient-centered care, and improving both oncology and CV outcomes for these patients.
