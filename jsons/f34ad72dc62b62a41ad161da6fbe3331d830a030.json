We outline a flexible behavioral, dynamic, and sectorial epidemic model of both virus transmission dynamics and endogenous policy and citizen responses. The model allows exploring distinct policy interventions, comprising general and targeted testing and social contact reduction efforts. Calibrating the model to the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic at the level of continents, we demonstrate how the early and extensive buildup of testing and social contact reduction efforts interplay to suppress the outbreak. Further, through a synthetic dynamic analysis of virus resurgence and of stratified case severity across population segments, we show the importance of targeted approaches for effectively reducing the multifaceted impacts of the outbreak. Finally, to aide critical collective involvement of policymakers, volunteers, citizens, and media for successfully controlling outbreaks as these, a version of the model is also available as a free web-based management flight simulator.",

The model differentiates reactive and proactive testing approaches as well as differentiates interventions such as general population social distancing, home confinement of suspected populations, and quarantining of positive cases detected. Importantly, in the model, as in real life, citizens and policy makers respond to reported -not actual -data of a progressing virus outbreak. Each of these behaviors in turn alters the outbreak path itself. The model tracks key epidemic variables over time (including the population within the various epidemic stages and the reproductive number -the average number of secondary cases that one case generates over the course of its infectious period), as well as clinical data (hospitalizations, deaths), and behavioral data (such as the degree of social contacts, and home-confined population, reported versus actual cases etc.). The model is generic in the sense that it can be used to explore how the dynamics change depending assumptions related to infectious diseases, such as SARS, HIV, H1N1, and H5N1, Influenza, and Ebola, 1 as well as can handle differing assumptions about citizen and policy behavior across populations, within and across socio-demographic segments.",

Disaggregating our baseline at the level of continents, we demonstrate how differences in early and extensive testing and extensive social contact reduction measures interplay and can explain different outbreak pathways across regions.

Powerful positive feedbacks that accelerate infections combine with delays in infection detectability, inertia in the buildup of testing capabilities, and with challenges in rapidly limiting human contacts. Together these factors lay the ground for the risks associated with wait-and-see approaches to epidemic outbreaks. In showing these interdependencies the model further helps understand how swift and comprehensive responses can reduce the impact of epidemic outbreaks. In clarifying these endogenous dynamics, our model provides insights that are fundamentally different from, but complement, policy models that study interventions as exogenous shocks (Kissler et al. 2020) . By allowing the exploration of different intervention strategies through endogenous behavior -from social distancing advice, to self-home confinement , and enforced quarantine, we provide a general quantitative framework for better understand under what conditions measures are critical for successful reversing epidemic growth if applied efficaciously at an early stage of an outbreak or during the later stage of resurgence management.",

SARS-CoV-2 causes the respiratory illness coronavirus disease 2019 . (Hereafter we solely use the acronym SARS-CoV-2, indicating either.) Main symptoms include diverse symptoms from respiratory infections, ranging from mild to severe, such as fever, malaise, cough, shortness of breath and pneumonia. In addition, phlegm, sore throat, headache, hemoptysis, nausea, and diarrhea also appear. Elderly, immunocompromised patients, and patients with underlying medical comorbidities are most likely to be in critical condition or die from the virus. Best current estimates suggest a case fatality rate (CFR) for SARS-CoV-2 of about 1-2% (Shim et al., 2020; WHO, 2020b) , much larger than the order of 0.1% for a moderate seasonal influenza. Yet, there is still much uncertainty about this number because of the often limited testing capabilities, and endogenous factors such as hospital overload (Ghaffarzadegan and Rahmandad, 2020) . Further, estimating the CFR requires information about the number infected (the denominator). Yet, this number is hard to detect, because of the large number of cases with mild and/or flu-like symptoms. For example, about 80% of people with SARS-COV-2 has mild (or no) symptoms, while 20% has severe symptoms, with about a third of those latter group becoming critically ill (ECDC, 2020).",

Estimating values of parameters such as infectious contacts and duration of infectivity is of critical interest to those seeking to impact this (Anderson et al., 2020) . Compared to Influenza, or Ebola transmission is rapid due too high infectivity. The duration of the infectious period for SARS-COV-2 is estimated to be 5-10 days (Zou et al. 2020) , after an incubation period of 2-14 (5.5 average) days. The incubation period for SARS-COV-2 is about 5-6 days (Li et al. 2020) . The fundamental metric transmissibility of a virus, the basic reproduction number R0 -representing the number of people infected during once infectivity at the first infection -is estimated to be on the order of 2.4-3.3, quite higher than that for seasonal flus or Ebola (Chowell et al. 2004 ) but lower than for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Lipsitch et al. 2003; Read et al. 2020; Walker et al. 2020) .

While the outbreak has been contained within multiple countries through early government action and through social distancing measures taken by individuals, in many other countries this has not been the case. 2 To illustrate, consider the outbreak and responses across three continents ( Figure 1 ). The three graphs show respectively cumulative reported cases (per million people (pmp)), cumulative tests performed (pmp), and metrics of social activities, starting from the day of the first case reported case to the WHO (December 31, 2019, time = 0 in the Figure) until April 8 (time = 100). The first reported cases within South Korea, Italy (the first known epicenter in Europe), and United States occurred all within one day (January 18-19 2020, Figure 1 , top left). Initially, reported cases were much higher in South Korea, suggesting it had become an epicenters. However, the fate of the countries differed considerably during the following 90 days: Whereas in South Korea reported cases stabilized under 200 pmp by early March, in Italy by the end of march it was at 1700 cases pmp whereas in the United States ,by the end of March, there were already 527 reported cases pmp. Case reporting however, is not independent from case testing. In South Korea it took 43 days to get from the first reported case to 2500 tests pmp, at which point there were 68 reported cases ppm. Italy reached 2500 tests pmp 15 days later with reported cases ppm at 291 ppm . The United States, reached this on March 27, 26 days later than South Korea, at which point there were 260 (steeply growing) cases ppm.

Finally efforts are done to build capacity of local government, build systems of cooperation between affiliated organizations, and educate and raise public awareness among the community (Korean CDCs, 2020). In Europe confinement policies have been implemented but often much more slowly. Yet, they have more focused on confinement of the general population. Italy's general lockdown commenced in the center and was gradually expanded to northern provinces (March 8). In the United States, despite urging from public health experts, by eatly April some states and counties have taken limited action, with beaches and restaurants still open (Axelrod, 2020) . Indeed, social activity has taken much more time to slow in Europe and North America (Figure 1 , bottom showing short term Air B&B lettings and Mobility trends for places like public transport hubs such as subway, bus, and train stations ).",

The model focuses on an infectious disease outbreak throughout its epidemic period. While the main focus of the model is highlighting interactions among key policy levers and citizen responses and with virus transmission dynamics, transmission and behavior can be affected considerably by geographic and by socio-demographic conditions. For example, the perceived severity of the outbreak at which policy makers and citizens begin to respond to the outbreak -differs by region and is in the baseline lower for the early Asian countries than for others regions. To allow exploring key sensitivities to demographic variation, he model disaggregates into N demographic segments. These sections can be used to represent geographical regions such as continents, countries, provinces for example (as long they are sufficiently large so that individual contacts are less important).

Asia has a higher detection fraction of the mild cases than the other regions. This is in part the result of proactive -field-based -testing and monitoring. The top left graph shows the social contacts for exposed population reducing due to social distancing and, to some degree, home confinement, of targeted policies (mostly in Asia.). As more cases get detected governments and citizens respond and reduce action. Asia has a strong sensitivity of social distancing to the outbreak and hence a strong balancing feedback loop B3, Figure 5 ).

The basic reproductive number R0 captures how transmission parameters as social contacts affect the initial growth rate of the outbreak. It is defined as the average number of secondary infections produced when one infected individual is introduced into a host population where everyone is susceptible (Dietz, 1975) . A value of R0 > 1 implies that an epidemic can get started. The reproductive number R ( Figure  5b , bottom left) captures how changes in transmission parameters as social contacts (as well as changes in the remaining susceptible population, which is negligible here) affect the growth rate of the active cases and thus of the outbreak over time. The reproductive number begins at around 3 close to estimates of the basic reproductive number R0 (Read et al. 2020) . It then first goes below 1 in Asia followed by Europe, and North America, and the Total (including other continents.). Figure 6b bottom right shows the over-time population distribution of the population (exposed, quarantined, symptomatic (non-detected), hospitalized, and cumulative deaths). The figure highlights the lags in peaking from exposed towards hospitalized. Global hospitalized populations peak later than others, early May at around 350 Thousand people. (This is most likely an underestimation of both timing of peak and quantity.) 6 A note of caution: Any simulation, but in particular those looking forward during a developing case (as this one) should be interpreted with great caution and scepticism, for at least three reasons: i) there is still much uncertainty about transmission parameters; ii) estimation of behavioural parameters is done at a very aggregate level and with a bias towards the Asian and early European outbreaks. This does not necessarily are a good representation of other regions; iii) forward looking outcomes do not incorporate future policy and citizen actions that may different from those simulated here. Yet, the uncertainty is fundamental to the problem itself. Our main purpose is to develop and enhancing a grounded understanding of the problem, to build confidence in and allow challenge what are brought forward as plausible explanations, and support in the best way those policy decisions that need to take place under this great uncertainty.",

The effect of High responsiveness vs Low responsiveness values are shown for North America. High (Low) indicate parameter settings that correspond to high (low) policy/citizen responsiveness to the outbreak. (Table 3 shows details on parameter ranges compared to the baseline). Once can see that a more responsive government to the outbreak, citizen's social distancing, and earlier testing ramp up all have the effect to reduce cumulative cases. The Low parameter values are approximately equal to Asia's baseline values. Hence, the results suggest that each of the policy measures taken -earlier and more extensive can help reduce the outbreak. On the other hand, any reduced responsiveness greatly exacerbates the outbreak. Further, we see a strong interaction effect among socio-behavioral responses (See \"All\" vs individual changes).",

This is because the increased actual cases creates precisely those problems that make it hard to keep up with testing. This observation is important because reported cases are main drivers for decisions and citizen responses. This itself contributes to the strong effects we observe in the actual cases. Further, deaths (white bars) correlate more with the actual than with reported cases. While it is problematic to respond to reported deaths (with lags between infection and death being 3-4 weeks), the sensitivity analysis shows the risk of underestimating the effects of too little action, when driven by reported cases (especially when relative reported cases are low). Figure 7 (top right) highlights these amplification effects from response interactions and in particular from the delays in the system, showing hospitalizations. While actual cumulative cases are strongly sensitive to changes in behavioral responses, lagged elements in the system, such as hospitalization experience even stronger amplification (compare with actual cumulative cases in Figure 6 ) . Figure 8 further highlights the strong interaction effect between behavioral responses to the outbreak. Figure 7 (left) shows the joint effect of social distancing and the threshold for building testing capacity. While a moderate higher/lower response has the effect of reducing (lighter colors)/increasing (darker colors) actual cumulative cases, their joint change strongly amplifies these effects. For example, policies that stimulate social distancing are greatly enhanced when policy makers and citizen have a more accurate perception of the extent of the outbreak. Figure 8 (right) shows even more clearly the hurdle to implementing effective policies during the outbreak, because of such interaction effects. The figure shows again, testing sensitivity, but now interacting with the clustering parameter, indicating the efficiency at which \"detectable/suspected cases \" (those that have been infected by others) are actually identified and tested. The map indicates that improving this effectiveness does not necessarily help. This is so because successful targeted testing requires a lot of \"detectable/suspected cases\". Thus, absent capacity to identify cases in the first place, one cannot find others through such targeted approaches. One need a combination of high effectiveness in identifying of both early testing buildup. Note the positive feedback that acts to move efforts towards downstream-reactive testing -away from pro-actively identifying, testing, and isolating upstream exposed and symptomatic populations: once testing capacity falls behind, most cases are identified in the hospital, or through severe-symptoms in the late stage ( Figure  A7 shows the positive feedbacks involved in detail). By then those have infected many others, but at this point there is also little opportunity to both identify and test those that they infected. Instead, slack in testing capacity frees up resources for proactive testing and helps build up a stock of potentially identifiable existing and future cases.",

Different from a first wave, during resurgence testing capacity will likely be available. Hence, in this phase pro-active testing approaches (community oriented, and/or contact tracing) will be a feasible as a policy even when not so during the first wave. To illustrate how this may work, consider a stylized region of 16M people (the approximate size of a metropole like New York or Paris, of the hard-hit region of Northern Italy, or of a country like the Netherlands.). At time zero we introduce an outbreak with 100 undetected infections with characteristics identical to that of SARS-COV-2. Finally, to allow resurgence we let policy makers and citizens respond to the reported active (not cumulative) cases (Table 2 shows all parameters different from the baseline.) Figure 9 shows simulations using these synthetic data, varying proactive testing effectiveness (measured by the clustering parameter \" ). First notice that all scenarios respond similarly to the first wave, irrespective of proactive testing effectiveness. This is so because, as before, testing is capacityconstrained. Therefore, proactive testing can do little to alter the path of the first wave during which testing capacity is being built up (and lags). We note further that this firs wave is similar to what it would have been in case of a population responding to cumulative cases.",

In a final analysis we use the model segmentation to help better understand how these differences affect the different population groups as well as the overall outbreak dynamics. To illustrate the value of analyzing this in more depth, we focus in particular on explaining the role of different social interactions across these segments in different countries in explaining the outbreak patterns. We perform an analysis in the same stylized way as the previous experiment. Doing this helps focus on the key dynamics at work. We again use a stylized region of 32M (2*16M) people, but now we differentiate the population into two age cohorts, differentiating those that are more and less vulnerable (consider \"older\" and \"younger\" populations, though note that the distinction can also proxy other stratifying variables such as income or race.). We control the difference between the segments by varying their relative case fatality ( \" ), holding the average case fatality constant. Testing capacity grows as before, with an initiation threshold of 100 hospitalized cases. At time 0 we introduce again a SARS-COV-2 outbreak with 200 undetected infections, but only within the less vulnerable population segment. (See Table 3 for parameter details.) Figure 10 shows the results. The graphs show on the horizontal axis the relative case fatality (\u02c6) across the segments (relative to within segment contacts). A value of one indicates that the fraction of severe cases (and therefore the same case fatality rates), is identical in the two segments, while moving to the left signifies a relative severity of cases (and with that case fatality) that increases for the vulnerable population. The left graph shows the actual cases (left vertical axis, as share of the population) and deaths (right vertical axis, percentage of total population in the stylized simulation). We also vary relative contact rates between the segments ( \" . \" ). Continuous (dashed) lines have high (low) intersegment contacts. (When varying contact rates between segments we control for total contact rates within the population.) The right graph shows the cumulative death fraction, in three different ways: total versus reported, total versus actual cases, and as the share of vulnerable population to the total. (For reference, one can see that this share reaches to 50% at high intersegment contacts, when z =\u02c6.) The graph shows a number of interesting insights about how cases and deaths develop as we vary these two parameters. In particular, when case fatality is very uneven, actual cases increase (left graph). This is so because low vulnerability implies (mild on average milder symptoms and, because of that, lower detection. With low reporting there is little policy response and infections can easily spread among the less vulnerable populations. A relevant, but not unrealistic starting condition in this analysis is that the outbreak initiated among the young population. For example, in regions like New York City it appears that socially active younger population (with mostly mild symptoms) one can envision that the virus has spread rapidly but fairly undetected for a while. The results further show that the worst case in terms of absolute fatalities, high variation in case fatality, and relatively high contacts between the population segments, disproportionally affects the vulnerable population (dashed line top right.) This is so because after the virus spread has spread among those who are less vulnerable, it can easily spread to the vulnerable population segment, at which point it is uncontrollable. It is the latter that may have be playing part in Italy, with relative contacts across generations generally being larger than in many other countries.",

To illustrate, consider a population of = 16 and e = 16 undetected cases in total (ie 0.1% of the population, so z = 0.1%, assuming for simplicity \u22c5 Q = 1). Let e =1000 of those cases exist within some known hotzones/clusters/communities etc., and Q\u22c5 =50 tests being performed within those known hotzones, with search time J =1 day.Then, a targeted search effectiveness Q = 1 (random search) would give about 0.05 expected positive tests. Then, using the approximation 0.6 positive tests, while Q = 24 gives \u2248 1.2 positive tests, and Q = 480 gives about 23 out of 50 tests being positive. (When actually using the model Equation 5 for Q , Q = 480 gives about 19 out of 50 tests positive -one can see the diminishing returns in Q ). The value of targeted search effectiveness Q depends much on conditions affected by social structures and mobility of the population as well as on the capabilities of experts in tracing actual positive cases within hot-zones given such structures and mobility.For sampling, simply ;S,e = e . For targeted testing the pool of detectable symptomatic population JS,e depends on active work done to trace the tested population and identify potential suspect cases. Thus, JS,e builds with the detection of new cases , depending on the contact tracing ability as well as on the effective cases each infects, . Thus, new detectable cases build with The actual change rate is contained with the size of the pool of undetected cases and has outflow proportional to the loss rate of undetected cases.
