To customize face mask seals, 3D laser scanning can be implemented to scan exact facial parameters, with a tailored and customized face seal N95 template. Anthropometric data of the chin arc, jawline, face and nose lengths, and nose protrusion measurements can be taken into account with this customized seal. In a study using face seal prototypes with Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene plastic using a Fused Deposition Modeling 3D printer, three subjects showed improved contact pressure compared with use of 3M\u00a9 8210 N95 FFR respirator masks4. Moreover, a personalized mask may account for facial hair length and density for a more precise fit.",

The semi-crystalline structure may cause significant distortion of the 3D printed parts upon cooling thereby making 3D printing difficult. Material extrusion 3D printing was used to design a 3D printable thermoplastic elastomeric material from a blend of polypropylene (PP) and styrene-(ethylene-butylene)-styrene (SEBS)5. This blend provides better printability and flexibility for N95 mask design. PP is commonly used for various industrial applications due to its low cost, processability, printability, recyclability and mechanical integrity. SEBS is a polymeric elastomer with low processing temperature and low distortion during extrusion5. Thus, the PP/SEBS combination would improve the processability of 3D printed N95 masks. Moreover, controlling the thermoplastic elastomer ratio allows for tailoring the flexibility and elasticity of the 3D model material for better fitted masks. 3D melt electrospinning printing can also be used to create PP microfibers with sequential layering to accurately obtain a 3D form3\n,\n6. Thus, 3D printing procedures may allow for the creation of stable and biocompatible N95 masks that are comparable to industrial manufacturing brands.

However, the synthetic polymer biomaterials needed for 3D-printed personal protective equipment are exact or very similar in composition to the standard manufacturing grade products (i.e. N95 masks provides the same fluid barrier and air filtration protection)4, 5, 6. Moreover, these synthetic polymer materials are readily available and cost effective (i.e. polypropylene is 12.47 cents per pound). 3D printer costs vary but are an excellent investment with labor performed via robotics.
