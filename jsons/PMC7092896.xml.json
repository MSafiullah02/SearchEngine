            "text": "The lignocellulose component of the plant cell wall is composed of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin [1], [2]. Microbial degradation of lignocellulosic biomass in animal feed and food production, and softwood pulp bleaching in paper production is of increasing industrial significance [3], [4], [5], [6]. Hemicelluloses are either highly or partially acetylated, which strongly inhibits degradation by polysaccharide-hydrolyzing enzymes [6]. However, the activity of major hemicellulose-hydrolyzing enzymes such as xylanases and mannanases can be enhanced by the enzymes acetylxylan esterase and acetyl esterase, which remove acetyl groups from hemicellulose [7], [8]. Carbohydrate esterases (CE), which includes acetylxylan and acetyl esterase, are categorized into 16 families (CE1\u201316) within the CAZy database (http://www.cazy.org/Carbohydrate-Esterases.html) [9]. With the exception of CE4, most CE family enzymes contain an \u03b1/\u03b2-hydrolase fold and function as serine esterases via a catalytic triad [10], [11], [12], [13].",

We recently reported the crystal structure of a fungal CE3 acetyl esterase with a catalytic domain from Talaromyces cellulolyticus (TcAE206; PDB code 5b5s, previous PDB code 3x0h) [16]. Even though the structure of TcAE206 is similar to that of other CE3 enzymes, its substrate specificity differs considerably. TcAE206 exhibits enzymatic activity against acetylated oligosaccharides but not acetylated xylans [16]. In contrast, CtCes3-1 shows enzymatic activity against acetylated xylans and oligosaccharides [14] The substrate specificity of Sm23 was omitted from this comparison because acetylated xylans and oligosaccharides were not used as substrates [15]. The manner in which the acetylated carbohydrate moiety binds has yet to be fully elucidated, however. Here, we report for the first time the substrate/product complex structure of a CE3 family enzyme and discuss the substrate-induced conformational change in the generally basic residue His182.",

The collected active fractions were saturated with 1.0 M (NH4)2SO4 and then loaded onto a HiTrap PHE column (GE Healthcare) previously equilibrated with the same buffer containing 1.0 M (NH4)2SO4. The enzyme was eluted with a linear 1.0\u20130.0 M (NH4)2SO4 gradient. The active fractions were pooled, concentrated, and loaded onto a Superdex 200 pg gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 50 mM NaCl. The purity of the target protein was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. The protein concentration was determined by measuring the absorption at 280 nm.

Interestingly, significant electron density coordinated in a distorted octahedral form with six coordination bonds was also observed: Asp56 (OD1 and OD2), three water molecules, and His98 (NE2) in crystallographic symmetry. These features are not present in the structures of wild-type TcAE206, CtCes3-1, or Sm23 [14], [15], [16]. We assigned a zinc ion to this electron density based on electron density size, shape, and coordination number, which is appropriate based on the presence of ZnSO4 in the crystallization solution. It is assumed that introduction of this zinc ion further strengthens the hydrogen bond network between neighboring molecules. Calcium and zinc ions are located sufficiently far from the active site that they are presumed to contribute to stabilization of the structure rather than catalytic activity.",

The area around the pocket region of S10A is more hydrophobic than the area around the pocket of CtCes3-1; S10A has few charged residues in this area to interact with a carbohydrate moiety. Therefore, in comparison with CtCes3-1, it appears to be less favorable for TcAE206 to bind long substrates (i.e., polysaccharides).",

S10A assumes the SGNH-hydrolase superfamily structure; the key residues constituting the catalytic triad (Ser10Ala, Asp179, and His182) and oxyanion hole (Ser10Ala, Gly62, and Asn92) are completely conserved, as described above. Some SGNH-hydrolases, such as coronavirus hemagglutinin-esterase (PDB code 3cl5) [26], platelet-activating acetyl hydrolase (PDB code 1wab) [27], and Neisseria meningitides peptidoglycan O-acetylesterase (PDB code 4k7j) [28], reportedly form a complex with an acetate ion at a position equivalent to that in S10A. Therefore, the acetate ion in S10A is considered to be located in the correct position for catalytic activity [26], [27], [28]. The acetate ion (O) in S10A forms three hydrogen bonds: with the side chain of Asn92 (ND), the main chain amide of Ala10, and Gly62, at distances of 2.8, 2.9, and 2.9 \u00c5, respectively (Fig. 3A). These three hydrogen bonds have been observed in other SGNH-hydrolases as well [26], [27], [28]. The acetate ion is thought to stabilize the oxyanion hole by forming hydrogen bonds. Interestingly, the position of the acetate ion is normally occupied by a water molecule, essentially stabilizing the formation of the oxyanion hole in TcAE206 (Fig. 3B) and CtCes3-1 (Fig. 3C).",

In contrast, the main chains of Gly62 and Asp179 and the side chain of Asn92 (ND) are slightly close to the acetate ion. In addition, His182 (NE2) moves 0.8 \u00c5 further toward the center of the active site (acetate ion) than does His182 (NE2) of TcAE206 (Fig. 3B). The His residue is thought to play a key role in the catalytic activity of serine esterases, as described below. In the absence of substrate, Ser10 forms a hydrogen bond with His182 (Fig. 4\n, step 1). In the presence of substrate, the nucleophilic Ser is deprotonated by the generally basic His residue in cooperation with the generally acidic Asp and then attacks the carbonyl carbon of the substrate (Fig. 4, step 2 and 3). The resulting tetrahedral intermediate rapidly breaks down to a covalent acyl-enzyme (Ser\u2013acetyl group) and alcohol moiety (Fig. 4, step 4). By releasing the alcohol moiety, a space is made for the hydrolytic water molecule. The hydrolytic water molecule is also deprotonated by the His residue, and the resulting hydroxyl anion attacks the acyl-enzyme (Fig. 4, step 5 and 6), thereby returning the Ser residue to a protonated state so that it is ready for the next reaction (Fig. 4 step 1). Our data suggest that the His residue should move toward the center of the active site to facilitate these two deprotonation steps.",
