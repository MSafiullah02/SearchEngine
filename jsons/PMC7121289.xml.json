It made clear that protection of the health of vulnerable populations would require a new approach to risk assessment.

In 1995, the EPA issued a National Policy to consistently and explicitly take into account health risks to children and infants from environmental hazards when conducting assessments of environmental risks. In 1997, the Clinton Administration issued an Executive Order, Executive Order 13045: Protection of Children from Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks. The Executive Order requires all federal agencies to address health and safety risks to children, to coordinate research priorities on children\u2019s health, and to ensure that their standards take into account special risks to children. To implement the order, the US EPA established the Office of Children\u2019s Health Protection (OCHP) (renamed the Office of Children\u2019s Health Protection and Environmental Education \u2013 OCHPEE \u2013 in 2005), whose job is to work with Program and Regional Offices within the US EPA to promote a safe and healthy environment for children by ensuring that all regulations, standards, policies, and risk assessments take into account risks to children. Legislation, such as the Food Quality Protection Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act amendments, has made coverage of children\u2019s health issues more explicit, and research on children\u2019s health issues is continually expanding. As a result of the emphasis on children\u2019s risk, the US EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD) developed a strategy for research on environmental risks to children. The goal of this research agenda is to discover the environmental causes of disease in children and then to convert these research findings into blueprints for disease prevention and health promotion.",

The Environment Ministers of the G8 countries acknowledged the special vulnerabilities of children and committed their countries to taking action on several specific environmental health issues such as lead, microbiologically safe drinking water, endocrine disrupting chemicals, environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), and air quality. They called on financial institutions, the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), and other international bodies to continue ongoing activities and to pay further attention to children\u2019s environmental health, in particular the economic and social dimensions of children\u2019s health. In addition, they committed their countries to fulfilling and to promoting the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Declaration on Risk Reduction for Lead.

The most commonly considered exposure pathways are inhalation, ingestion, and dermal absorption. For infants in the womb, transplacental transfer of toxic chemicals is another unique route of exposure, and for nursing infants, the proportion of the toxicant that enters the body through each of these pathways will depend on both external, environmental factors, and on biological factors that will determine the rate of uptake of the chemical by the organism.

For the first 6 months, for example, children consume on average 88 mL/kg/day of tap water directly or indirectly (water added in the preparation of formula or fruit juice) compared to adults who drink 17 mL/kg/day [6].

            "text": "Infants and young children have a higher resting metabolic rate and rate of oxygen consumption per unit body weight than adults. The oxygen consumption of a resting infant aged between 1 week and 1 year is 7 mL/kg body weight per minute, compared to that of an adult in the same condition, which is 3\u20135 L/kg/min [5]. Thus, on a body weight basis, the volume of air passing through the lungs of a resting infant is twice that of an adult, and therefore twice as much of any chemical in the atmosphere would pass through the lungs of an infant. An additional consideration is the smaller lung surface area per kilogram in the early stages of development. Thus, the higher amount of inspired air will affect a relatively smaller area of lung tissue. In addition, children have narrower airways than those of adults. Thus, irritation caused by air pollution that would produce only a slight response in an adult, can result in potentially significant obstruction in the airways of a young child [6]. Furthermore, the fact that children spend more time engaged in vigorous activities than adults exacerbates the differential effects. Children also ingest more food per unit of body weight than do adults. A 1\u20135 year old child eats three to four times more food per kilogram than the average adult, resulting in larger amounts of chemicals and infectious agents per unit of body mass [2, 7]. A child\u2019s diet is very different from an adult\u2019s. The diet of children contains more milk products and more fruits and vegetables per unit of body weight than adults. During the first year of life, human milk or cow milk\u2013based products constitute most of their energy and nutrient source. The NRC report [2] reported that over the first year, cow milk products comprise 36% and 58% of the diets of nursing and non-nursing infants, respectively, compared to adults, where milk and milk products constitute only about 29% of their diet. Environmental pollutants, such as PCBs and dioxins, accumulate in fat and have been found in breast milk, although it is broadly accepted that the benefits of breast-feeding still outweigh the risks of exposure [5].",

The absence of a metabolic pathway may result in the bioaccumulation of the chemical in the body and a later bioavailability and disposition to exert its toxic effects.

The early finding in the 1970s by Landrigan et al. [39] and Needleman [40] that low-dose exposure to lead is associated with a significant decrease in intelligence quotient (IQ) has been confirmed in many studies. The recommended action level of blood lead levels established by the Centers for Disease Control is 10 \u03bcg/dL of blood. However, epidemiological studies during the last decade have found strong evidence for cognitive deficits among school-aged children at blood lead levels below the current CDC action level [41, 42]. Further, in a pooled analysis of seven prospective longitudinal studies, the average IQ deficit associated with an increase in concurrent blood lead concentration from <1 to 10 \u03bcg/dL was about threefold that for an increase from 10 to 20 \u03bcg/dL [42]. Birth cohort studies have shown inverse dose-response relationships between transplacental lead exposure indices and central auditory processing indices among infants and children at maternal blood lead levels below 10 \u03bcg/dL [43].",

Children were followed and examined 6 years later and showed persistent behavioral abnormalities and ectodermal defects [55].",

The evidence indicates that PCBs cause neurobehavioral deficits in children who are exposed prenatally, while the evidence of effects of exposure to background levels commonly found in the general population is not conclusive. Studies support the association between low-level transplacental PCB exposure and childhood deficits in cognitive, psychomotor, memory, language, and attention functions [56, 57]. None of the studies up to date has been able to document an adverse effect of PCBs exposure from breast-feeding. It has been postulated that the larger fat compartment of the nursing infant than the fetus may make it possible to dilute somewhat the lipid-soluble contaminants absorbed through human milk. Thus, despite the occurrence of these contaminants in human milk, the advantages of breast-feeding for 4\u20136 months apparently override any limited neurotoxin damage due to the contaminants. Still, of particular concern would be the populations who frequently eat contaminated fish or who reside in contaminated areas and may still be exposed at levels that have been associated with adverse effect.",

In the course of development of the pancreas and pancreatic function, for example, several windows of susceptibility have been identified [71]. Studies about the Dutch Famine Winter have shown that poor maternal nutrition, especially during the last trimester of pregnancy had an impact on glucose tolerance and insulin resistance, and that in terms of obesity, those individuals born to mothers who were exposed to the famine around the first half of pregnancy were more obese than those of mothers exposed during the last trimester [72]. A number of subsequent studies have documented the role of the intrauterine environment, and low birth weight in the development of diabetes [71, 73] and other metabolic disorders.",

A recent study in Eastern Germany evaluated the association between respiratory symptoms and air pollution levels before and after political reunification.

While medical advances have led to a sharp reduction in mortality from childhood cancer, it is still a group of diseases with potentially devastating outcomes, which can be at least partially prevented; so the study of the environmental causes of cancer is essential. A recent report from the European Automated Childhood Cancer Information System (EACCIS) provides evidence of a 1% increase per year in childhood cancers and 1.5% increase per year in adolescent cancer in Europe for the period 1970\u20131999. All of the common types of neoplasms showed significant increases, including leukemias, lymphomas, central nervous system tumors, neuroblastomas, soft tissue sarcomas, retinoblastoma, and germ cell, renal, hepatic, and bone tumors in children and carcinomas, lymphomas, soft-tissue sarcomas, and germ cell and CNS tumors in adolescents. There were in addition significant differences between Eastern and Western Europe with regard to leukemias, lymphomas, carcinomas, and central nervous system tumors in children, and carcinomas, lymphomas, leukemias, and soft-tissue tumors in adolescents. Earlier reports of European populations also noted increases in several of these types of childhood cancers. Similarly, in the USA, there was an overall increase of about 25% in childhood cancers between 1975 and 2000. While the reported increases in the 1980s may have reflected improvements in diagnosis and reporting, it is unlikely that the most recently reported trends reflect the same bias. Evidence from both epidemiological and mutagenicity/carcinogenicity studies suggest that environmental toxicants may be involved at least in the causation of some forms of cancers such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), which is most common in industrialized countries.",

The occurrence of these events is modulated by several factors that themselves change in the course of development. Thus, DNA damage may be repaired by the action of DNA repair enzymes, whose presence and activity may change with age.

An increasing body of evidence implicates GST polymorphisms in risk of childhood leukemias. Glucuronidation, a type of Phase II reaction, catalyzed by uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase (UDG), is a key detoxification step for solubilization of high molecular weight carcinogens such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, heterocyclic amines, and tobacco-specific nitrosamines. Low expression of UDG in the fetus and neonate, and as a result of polymorphisms in children, could well increase sensitivity to carcinogenesis by some chemicals. Sulfotransferases (SULT) have been proposed to constitute a major enzymatic detoxification system in the fetus [136, 137]. However, these enzymes also catalyze activation of several types of chemical carcinogens to DNA-damaging forms, including aromatic amines, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, heterocyclic amines, 3-nitrobenzanthrone, and benzylic alcohols. This illustrates how alteration of enzymatic metabolism can greatly influence susceptibility to perinatal carcinogenesis.",

This review concluded that ionizing radiation and a variety of genetic conditions are thought to explain 5\u201310% of childhood cancers. There are clear associations between Epstein-Barr virus infection and Burkitts lymphoma in Africa, and between human immunodeficiency virus and Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma [138].",

For brain tumors, cured meats, polyomaviruses, and farm exposures were pointed out as potential causes. Changes in the incidence and characteristics of children with hepatoblastoma as well as risk factor studies suggest a role for an exposure of very low birth weight babies. High birth weight, tea or coffee consumption, and certain paternal occupations have shown some consistency in their association with Wilms\u2019 tumor. For most of the other cancers, very few epidemiologic studies have been conducted, so it is not surprising that nongenetic risk factors have not been detected.

While most of studies of smoking by mothers reveal no effects on childhood cancer, many studies of smoking by fathers have shown a significant association with risk of cancer in their children, and when both mothers and fathers are included in the study, the effect appears to be greater for exposure of fathers than of mothers [135]. This effect has been attributed to germ-cell mutations during spermatogenesis caused by tobacco products [146]. Three reports from the Oxford Survey of Childhood Cancers have suggested that paternal but not maternal cigarette smoking is associated with increased risks for the generality of childhood cancers. Some, however, have produced conflicting findings. A large case control study conducted in the UK (the United Kingdom Childhood Cancer Study) concluded that there was no evidence that paternal smoking is a risk factor for childhood cancer in general [147]. A significant association was reported in this study, however, between hepatoblastoma risks and smoking by both parents relative to neither parent smoking. Sorahan and Lancashire speculated that the importance of both parents smoking in the etiology of hepatoblastoma might arise from the combination of oxidative damage to sperm DNA and damage to the fetal liver from carcinogenic metabolites in the blood of the pregnant mother [148]. Further, in a study where both preconception and postnatal smoking by the fathers was quantified, and few of the mothers smoked, the association with childhood cancer related significantly only to preconceptional paternal smoking levels [149]. Thus, second-hand exposure of the infants to smoke was less likely. Transplacental effects of sidestream smoke were one possibility. In rats, sidestream smoke constituents received transplacentally caused oxidative DNA damage in fetal tissues [136]. In one epidemiological study, paternal smoking had a larger possible effect when mothers were nonsmokers [137], suggesting protective effects of detoxification enzymes induced in the placenta and in maternal tissues by maternal smoking.",

In a review that evaluated 18 new studies conducted between 1998 and 2004, it was concluded that while collectively all studies seem to suggest an increase in the risk of different cancer types associated with exposure to pesticides, no conclusions could be drawn with respect to cancer types as well as to specific causative factors across studies [153]. Infante-Rivard and Weichenthal [152] reviewed studies conducted between 1999 and 2004 and critically evaluated the evidence on the associations between pesticide exposures and leukemia (12 studies), brain cancer (10 studies), neuroblastoma (4 studies), non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (3 studies), Wilm\u2019s tumor (2 studies), and Ewing\u2019s sarcoma (1 study), as in the Zahm and Ward review. The authors found recent studies to be consistent with the suggestion of Zahm and Ward of an association between pesticide exposure and childhood leukemia, brain tumors, neuroblastoma, and also non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and Wilm\u2019s tumor. Specifically childhood exposure to household insecticides and prenatal exposure to pesticides seemed to pose the greatest risks of leukemia and brain tumors. Exposure-response gradients were observed in some studies on pesticide exposure and risk of leukemia. For neuroblastoma, the authors found that all four recent studies reviewed showed an association between exposure of pesticides and risk of neuroblastoma that supported earlier findings by Zahm and Ward. A recent study also indicates that residential use of pesticides, and herbicides specifically, may increase the risk of neuroblastoma in children [153]. The risk of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma was found to be associated with residential exposure to pesticides, and two of the studies reviewed provided evidence of exposure response gradients in two of the three reviewed studies. With respect to Wilm\u2019s tumor, recent studies did not provide additional evidence of an association between insecticide exposures and parental pesticide exposure before birth and Wilms\u2019 tumor that had been indicated in Zahm and ward\u2019s review. The evidence on Ewing\u2019s sarcoma was inconclusive.",

The strongest evidence in support of a causal relationship between pesticide exposure and childhood cancer was considered to be the repeated detection of statistically significant increased risks between childhood pesticide exposure and cancer. The authors concluded that there is sufficient evidence to conclude that there is at least some association between pesticide exposure and childhood cancer. In addition, the biological gradients observed in recent studies also suggest that there may be a causal relationship between childhood insecticide exposures and the development of ALL and NHL [158, 159]. Infante-Rivard [152] indicated that the development of childhood cancer probably depends on the presence of many factors, including genetic predisposition, and recommended the use of improved exposure assessments that include separate parental interview, specific pesticide exposure questions, and semiquantitative exposure measures that can be used to confirm exposure information obtained through questionnaires.",

The latter showed an association between incidence rates of childhood leukemia and levels of air pollution in the area of residence of the population at the time of diagnosis. The lack of information about the place of residence of subjects prior to diagnosis (including during the preconception and gestation period) made it difficult to conclude an association between the exposure levels and risk of childhood leukemia.

These increases cannot be explained only on the basis of improved diagnostic techniques, and it has been argued that these trends coincide roughly with the increasing use and release of industrial chemicals into the environment.

A direct association between these chemicals and increased risk of breast cancer has not been established. However, some researchers claim that the time of life when exposure takes place (e.g., prenatal, neonatal, childhood, adolescence) may have a major influence on the appearance of this and other health effects. The development of the mammary gland occurs in multiple stages. Fetal development of the mammary gland rudiment is governed by tissue interactions in both males and females. In females, the pubertal period drives ductal morphogenesis, and pregnancy results in massive differentiation of the mammary gland. Thus, the perinatal period and the period between age at menarche and age at first full-term pregnancy may be particularly important for breast tumor development and latency [165]. Young girls exposed to carcinogenic agents during puberty may be at high risk of future breast cancer due to susceptibility of rapidly growing breast tissue mediated by hormonal changes during this time. This claim is supported by data from atomic bomb survivors, where an increased risk of breast cancer was found in women exposed before 20 years of age [132]. Similarly, an elevated risk was found for women irradiated during childhood for medical reasons [166].",

Although clear cell adenocarcinoma occurs in only 0.1% of women who were exposed to DES in utero, this represents a 40-fold increased risk in comparison with the nonexposed population. In contrast, men who were exposed to DES in utero do not have a clear increased risk of any cancer, although a statistically nonsignificant threefold increased risk of testicular cancer has been reported [168]. While there is no epidemiological evidence for a link between exposure to estrogenic or anti-androgenic compounds and testicular cancer, some authors have hypothesized that the similar increases in the incidence of testicular cancer and in the incidence of cryptorchidism and hypospadias in similar geographical areas, suggest a common cause of similar environmental origin in both health effects [85].",

It has been hypothesized that early exposure to environmental toxicants could affect the brain later in life. Consensus among scientists is based on experimental studies on associations between early life exposures to pesticides and Parkinson\u2019s disease, as well as on epidemiologic studies of the toxic and apparently irreversible effects on the developing brain of in utero exposure to lead, methylmercury, and polychlorinated biphenyls. A mechanistic hypothesis proposed that early exposure to neurotoxic chemicals reduce the number of neurons in critical areas of the brain such as the substantia nigra to levels below those needed to sustain function in the face of neuronal attrition associated with advancing age. In addition, as some researchers have pointed out, the effects at population level would add a substantial burden to society, in terms of health, economic, and human costs.",

            "text": "The difficulties in conducting environmental health research have been pointed out by many authors during the last 3 decades. Human populations are exposed to hundreds of chemicals through air, water, and food, under many different exposure situations. Environmental exposures are usually low, and often occur concomitantly with occupational exposures, smoking or naturally occurring agents. And when an association between with an exposure and a disease in found, such as for example, air pollution and asthma, a long path lies ahead to determine the specific causative agent of the disease, and the population and individual susceptibility factors that makes some individuals and not others become ill. The potential for interaction of different pollutant exposures makes the question with respect to the role of environmental exposures impact on health even more difficult to answer. The need for taking into account multiple and cumulative exposures has been clearly affirmed by the EPA and other government and research bodies.",

It is possible that the statement of Olshan and Daniels [170] with respect to pesticide research, that \u201canother 40 epidemiological studies similar to the majority of those conducted thus far will not provide clarity,\u201d should be applied to other groups of chemicals, such as disinfection by-products, or endocrine disruptors, and that we need to think of a more effective way of examining evidence. Many authors have pointed out the need of better exposure assessment methods. In addition to continuing toxicological research, which is essential to elucidate the mechanisms of action, epidemiological research should probably incorporate exposure assessment methods that could enable detection of at least the specific exposures and exposure levels. Exposure assessment can be improved in many ways. In the extreme, if the body burden of a list of suspected carcinogens in the blood or adipose tissue of each child diagnosed with cancer were determined, more specific associations between disease and toxic agent may be determined. The path to confirm and rule out some proposed environmental causes would probably be at least somewhat shorter. While this approach may be costly, it may be cost-efficient in the long run. There have been some efforts to integrate an environmental health perspective in the medical practice. These efforts should be further developed and supported.",
