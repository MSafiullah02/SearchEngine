Rapid telehealth expansion can be especially complex for pediatric patients. From the experience of a large academic medical center, this report describes a pathway for efficiently increasing capacity of remote pediatric enrollment for telehealth while fulfilling privacy, security, and convenience concerns. The design and implementation of the process took two days. Weekly enrollment subsequently increased 10-fold for children (age 0-12 years) and 1.2-fold for adolescents (age 13-17 years). Weekly telehealth visits increased 200-fold for children and 90-fold for adolescents. The obstacles and solutions presented in this report can provide guidance to health systems for similar challenges during the COVID-19 response and future disasters.",

[1] [2] [3] [4] On March 13, the United States Federal Government declared a national emergency and authorized the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to temporarily modify or waive certain requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act's (HIPAA) Privacy Rule and of safety net insurance policies to prepare for surging care demand. [5] In response, the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) at HHS announced it would exercise its enforcement discretion and \"not impose penalties for noncompliance with the regulatory requirements under the HIPAA Rules against covered health care providers in connection with the good faith provision of telehealth during the COVID-19 nationwide public health emergency.\" [6] Governmental and social guidelines encouraged \"social distancing\" to reduce viral spread. [7 8 ] Similar guidelines, including those outlined in Tennessee Executive Orders 18 and 25, pushed for health systems to reduce nonurgent, in-person healthcare visits and elective scheduled procedures. [9] [10] [11] To comply with these recommendations, many health systems have rapidly expanded telehealth offerings. [12] [13] [14] Virtual clinic visits can help manage routine clinical care and surging demand in the setting of outpatient clinic closures during medical disasters, as documented during the rapid medical response following Hurricane Maria (Puerto Rico, 2017). [15] During the COVID-19 pandemic, virtual visits can also connect patients to testing resources while honoring selfquarantine requirements. [12 15-17] While telehealth holds great promise, its rapid expansion has created new challenges that may overwhelm existing infrastructure. [12] Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) is a large, private, nonprofit, academic medical center with telehealth capabilities integrated into its patient portal, My Health at Vanderbilt (MHAV). MHAV was first deployed in 2004 to support secure messaging between provider and patient, appointment scheduling, billing management, access to laboratory results, and access to other electronic health record (EHR) data. [18 19 ] VUMC previously implemented direct-topatient telehealth through MHAV to streamline the patient and provider experience. By integrating telehealth within MHAV, patients benefit from using a familiar applicationlowering the barrier for entry into telehealth. Patient portal-based telehealth builds on existing clinical relationships and guides their conversion to a telehealth relationship. In addition, patient portal integration allows clinicians the additional benefit of harnessing existing workflows, which facilitates access to the complete medical record while documenting, scheduling, and communicating with patients.",

This led to new enrollment and customer support challenges, especially since patient portal activation is required for telehealth participation. Virtual identity verification of new patients using telehealth tools scaled smoothly for adults, but was more complicated for pediatric and adolescent patients. MHAV serves patients of all ages and, prior to the pandemic, had robust policies and procedures in place to support in-person enrollment for children and adolescents. [18] In the existing MHAV policy framework, families with children (0-12 years) and adolescents (13-17 years) had to enroll in-person to verify identity and, in the case of adolescent patients, to ensure patient consent has been given for parental access to the patient's medical record. However, social distancing measures make in-person MHAV enrollment infeasible, and created a need for remote enrollment for MHAV to enable telehealth visits.",

This report describes our experience incorporating these requirements into the design and implementation of a process for rapid expansion of child and adolescent patient enrollment for telehealth visits during the COVID-19 pandemic. VUMC has policies governing patient portal enrollment for children aged 0-12 years and for adolescents aged 13-17 years. For children, caregivers can create accounts for their child after verifying their identity as parents, guardians, or conservators. For adolescents, both the caregiver and adolescent must mutually agree to joint access to the portal with biological parent, guardian, or conservator (in addition to the identity verification step used for children under 13). This separate process for adolescent patients was instituted at VUMC to safeguard adolescents' right to confidentiality.",

State laws, in turn, have considerable variance in defining applicable care episodes for the adolescent right to confidentiality, with particular attention to the \"sensitive areas\" of emergency care, sexual health, substance use, and mental health. [20] In Tennessee specifically, minors aged 16-17 are legally allowed to consent to substance use and mental health treatment without parental consent. [21] In practice, this enrollment process was historically conducted during in-person clinic visits to confirm capacity and consent for personal health information (PHI) use within MHAV portal, as well as to confirm identity.",

For new patients, the lack of existing supporting information and identification confirmation required an alternative process. Further, for patients 13-17 years old, the additional step of confirming adolescent assent required an alternative process (Tables 1 and 2 ). This process needed to be accessible for patients while respecting information security (e.g. email is not considered secure, and secure fax-based approaches are not accessible to most families).",

This need was incorporated into the electronic REDCap forms using an additional link. As such, non-biological parents, guardians, and conservators were required to use the electronic sign-up process ( With the surging demand of new telehealth visits and, by extension, new MHAV enrollments, the combined burden of application processing and video identity confirmation falling under a single HealthIT team proved to be a significant bottleneck. To alleviate this burden, the process was modified to allow clinic staff to verify identity via two-way video for patients 0-12 years when the parent is a biological parent and, therefore, does not require additional paperwork.",
