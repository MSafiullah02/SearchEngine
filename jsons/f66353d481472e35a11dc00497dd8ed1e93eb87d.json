Because OSCN\u2212 is effective against a vast range of viruses and micro-organisms, a general cidal effect seems implicated, not directed at specific proteins. This would suggest a wide potential application of OSCN-, possibly also against SARS-CoV-2, with low risk of resistance due to mutations [22] .
