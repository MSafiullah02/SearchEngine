This diversification could represent an inevitable drift under purifying selection, the majority of substitutions being phenotypically neutral. The alternative is to suppose that most fixed mutations are beneficial to the virus, allowing it to keep ahead of the host and/or host population. Here, relative sequence diversification of different proteins encoded by viral genomes is found to be linear. The examples encompass a wide variety of retroviruses and RNA viruses. The smoothness of relative divergence spans quasispeciation following clonal infection, to variation among different isolates of the same virus, to viruses from different species or those associated with different diseases, indicating that the majority of fixed mutations likely reflects drift. This held for both mammalian and plant viruses, indicating that adaptive immunity doesn't necessarily shape the relative accumulation of amino acid substitutions. When compared to their hosts RNA viruses evolution appears conservative.",

This is particularly evident from recent work on the dynamics of three viruses: human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (Ho et al. 1995; Wei et al. 1995) and human hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV and HCV) (Nowak et al. 1996; Zeuzem et al. 1998 ). Following therapeutic intervention, plasma viral loads were measured revealing massive destruction-between 10 8 to 10 12 virions per day, or 50-90% of the total. Calculations related to the genesis of sequence diversity concur with these findings and indicate that the majority of infected cells are destroyed before they can give rise to progeny (Wain-Hobson 1993; Pelletier et al. 1995) . In other words, only a small fraction of infected cells are productively infected. The obvious predators are immune responses. The other hurdle viruses have to overcome is transmission, which may represent a severe bottleneckinfection can be initiated by a single virion. The massive destruction and precariousness of transmission could well introduce a strong stochastic component into the evolution of their genomes.",

In lieu of any nucleic acid proofreading mechanism, the mutation rates for RNA viruses and retroviruses are between 0.2-2 per genome per cycle (Drake 1991 (Drake , 1993 Domingo and Holland 1997) . This shows up in the amino acid fixation rates for RNA viral and retroviral proteins, which is of the order of 10 6 greater than those of their vertebrate, invertebrate, and plant hosts (Gojobori and Yokoyama 1985) . By contrast, DNA viruses either encode proofreading enzymes (e.g., herpes and pox viruses) or are edited by the host replication machinery (e.g., papilloma viruses). Accordingly, the mutation rates for DNA viruses are 10 4 -10 6 -fold lower than their RNA counterparts (Domingo and Holland 1997) . To what extent do RNA viruses exploit genetic variation, if at all? Given such a superior fixation rate, are they adapting or merely changing?",

To explore the impact of Blosum corrections on the relative divergence of viral proteins, pairwise comparisons were made for the HCV NS5A/NS5B and E2/NS5B without any correction. As can be seen from Table 1 , the linear relationships, particularly the gradients, were hardly affected.

Furthermore, linear re-gression passed close to the origin except for a plot of Nef versus RT. Despite this, the correlation coefficient was highly significant. As for HCV, the relative rates of sequence divergence (y/x) varied by little more than a factor of two. The reason why the hypervariable gp120 protein shows a relatively low degree of change with respect to RT is that gap stripping effectively eliminates the hypervariable regions. Consequently, the analysis pertains to the conserved regions of gp120. All other alignments were only marginally influenced by gap stripping. Using larger data sets from partially sequenced HIV/SIV genomes yielded linear relationships for p17 Gag/p24 Gag, integrase/RT, and gp41/gp120 (Table 1) .",

Plants and insects are hosts to a wide variety of viruses and defend themselves uniquely via a multitude of innate defense systems markedly different to those of mammals (Brey and Hultmark 1998) .

When applied to proteins encoded by either potexviruses or potyviruses (positive stranded RNA genomes), relative divergence was always linear with intercepts close to the origin.

However, molecular clocks for viral proteins have been observed over small degrees of divergence (Elena et al. 1992; Gojobori et al. 1990; Hayashida et al. 1985; Leitner et al. 1997; McGeoch et al. 1995; Plikat et al. 1997; Querat et al. 1990; Sanchez et al. 1992; Villaverde et al. 1991; Yang et al. 1995) , certainly for a number of viruses analyzed here (e.g., influenza A hemagglutinin (HA), HIV Nef, HBV HBsAg). Hence it may be concluded that for small Blosum distances, out to 0.2-0.3, the linearity of relative sequence divergence is reflecting molecular clock behavior.",

(1) For a data set spanning 64 orthologous sets of chromosomal proteins, a molecular clock behavior was evident after applying the Blosum correction (Doolittle et al. 1996; Feng et al. 1997) . Therefore plotting Blosum-corrected distances for paired proteins would be expected to yield a straight line. (2) For the same data set (Doolittle et al. 1996; Feng et al. 1997) it can be shown that the uncorrected distances vary with time according to the relationship \u232cA \u202b\u05e1\u202c at m , where \u232cA is the sequence divergence among evolutionary related members of the set of proteins A, and a and m are constants. Similarly for protein B the relationship would be \u232cB \u202b\u05e1\u202c bt n , where b and n are constants. Obviously, since the maximum values of \u232cA and \u232cB tend to 1, m, n < 1. Comparing divergence among two proteins, say, A and B, encoded by the same genome yields \u232cA/\u232cB \u202b\u05e1\u202c a/bt (m\u2212n) . The format of the presentations in Figs. 1 and 2 is that of \u232cA versus \u232cB. A linear relationship is only possible when m \u202b\u05e1\u202c n, while the gradient equals the ratio of two constants, a and b. Rewriting the equations for a set of proteins one obtains \u232cA \u202b\u05e1\u202c at m , \u232cB \u202b\u05e1\u202c bt m . . . \u232cZ \u202b\u05e1\u202c zt m . Hence, differences in the rate of fixation of amino acid substitutions for different proteins are directly related to a constant (a, b . . . z), intrinsic to each protein.",

The obvious selection pressure on all mammalian viral proteins is T-cell immunity, which may recognize processed peptides from all viral proteins. However, linearity was noted for the relative divergence of plant viruses and bacteriophages, indicating that viruses such as HIV, HCV, and influenza A are not necessarily mutating to outwit their host's immune system. Or in terms of the above language, it is not axiomatic that the majority of amino acid changes reflects escape from host adaptive immune systems. In fact, an examination of the literature reveals very few unambiguous examples of escape from adaptive immune systems by ongoing variation within the host (Wain-Hobson 1996; Borrow and Shaw 1998) . Adaptive immunity is intimately associated with memory, which allows rapid secondary responses and protection of offspring by transfer of antibodies via the placenta and milk (Zinkernagel 1996; Mason 1998) .",

Fitness selection is an alternative, but presents a conundrum. For example, the data in Fig. 1 were all for the human hepatotropic virus, HCV. Being able to exclude T-cell immunity, it becomes reasonable to assume that the niche is fairly constant. Yet to conclude fitness selection is to assume that HCV is not adapted to its niche despite a 10 6 -fold increased mutation rate over host cell replication. Furthermore, given such an advantage, continual fitness selection, unrelated to T-cell immunity, should be measurable over a decade or so, then one would expect a steady increase in virulence. A similar argument could be made for HBV, HEV, or HGV. There is no evidence that HIV-1 is increasing in virulence. In contrast, the HIV/ SIV, rhino-, entero-, flavi-, influenza A, potex-, poty-, papilloma-, and geminiviruses data sets included viruses from different hosts and in some cases viruses of different tropism (Table 1, Fig. 2, ftp site) .

The number of substitutions allowing adaptation cannot be so great, otherwise the lineage would become extinct.

Of course, if the effective population size was much lower than the census population, as some studies suggest (Leigh Brown 1997) , the requirements become more stringent. Numerous studies of protein mutagenesis have shown that the fraction of viable mutants is surprisingly large while only a handful of substitutions are sufficient to confer enhanced thermal stability or even novel catalytic activities (Klein et al. 1997; Olins et al. 1995; Rennell et al. 1991; Martinez et al. 1996; Kucher and Arnold 1997; Qu\u00e9m\u00e9neur et al. 1998 ).

In a study of sequence variation for 64 groups of enzymes over geological time scales (Fig. 3A ) different enzymes fixed substitutions at rates that varied by little more than a factor of 2-3 (Doolittle et al. 1996; Feng et al. 1997 ). The parallel with viral proteins is striking: the range of relative rates was rarely more than a factor of 2-3-fold (gradients in Table 1 ), which indicates that there is little qualitative difference in the way viral proteins fix substitutions. The comparison of sequence divergence among orthologous viral and cellular proteins suggests a means to compare the two.",

For example, all retroviruses encode an aspartic protease whose C\u2423 coordinates overlap remarkably those of pepsin (Wlodawer and Erickson 1993) . Equally the picornaviruses and flaviviruses encode proteases orthologous to serine and cysteine proteases (Ryan and Flint 1997; Ryan et al. 1998 ). Among the 64 groups of enzymes analyzed was trypsin, a serine protease. Albeit absent from the original study, it is a reasonable assumption that the fixation of replacement substitutions for the chromosomal cysteine or aspartic acid proteases falls within the range described. Superimposing rhinovirus 2A or 3C proteases sequence divergence onto this figure is tantamount to >700 million years of chromosomal protein evolution (Fig. 3B ). Sequence variation within the HIV-1 aspartic protease alone is equivalent to >300 million years. Other examples reinforce these observations. In fact some 10 years ago it was noted that sequence variation among retroviral aspartic acid proteases was comparable to billions of years of DNA-based chromosomal evolution (Doolittle et al. 1989) . Figure 3B extends this thesis.",

This probably stems from the size limit inherent to RNA viral genomes. Due to the lack of proofreading the range is generally 5-15 kb, with the coronaviruses providing an upper limit at around 30 kb. Generally 50-100% of a RNA viral genome is taken up with coding for structural proteins, enzymes, and proteins involved in gene regulation. There is little room for additional coding material or gene duplication with subsequent diversification. DNA viral replication involves proofreading either by the host cell machinery or by viral encoded enzymes. DNA viruses genomes can be as small as the \u223c2-kb circuloviruses, extending up to the pox and herpes viruses (70-240 kb), which have picked up host cell genes (Smith et al. 1997) . One of the largest viral genomes, that of bacteriophage G (\u223c670 kb), is larger than that of the smallest cellular microbe, Mycoplasma genitalium (580 kb). Among many other things, the explosion in bacterial genomics is revealing large numbers of multigene families, insertion elements, phage remnants, and pathogenicity islands (Hacker et al. 1997) . By not encoding proofreading enzymes, RNA viruses cannot explore large genome configurations allowing gene duplication, domain shuffling, and gene capture.",
