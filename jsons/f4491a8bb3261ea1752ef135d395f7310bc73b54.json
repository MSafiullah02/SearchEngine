Results: Median follow-up was 198 days (interquartile range 64-518 days). The overall visual success rate of the cats with a 12-month follow-up was 92.6% (25/27 eyes). POH occurred in 35/82 (42.6%) eyes. Immediately postoperatively, uveitis was the most common complication in 28/82 eyes (34.1%) followed by corneal ulceration in 22/82 eyes (26.8%). At 1-90 days, uveitis in 41/81 eyes (50.6%) remained the most common complication, followed by synechia/dyscoria in 21/81 eyes (25.9%), corneal ulceration in 16/81 eyes (19.7%), and PCO in 15/81 eyes (18.5%). At >90 days, PCO in 17/47 eyes (36.1%), followed by synechia/dyscoria in 16/47 eyes (34%), was the most common complications. The number of eyes with synechia/dyscoria in the trauma group was higher (13/33 [39.3%]) than in the congenital/juvenile group (5/31",

The frequency of cataracts in cats has been reported to increase with age 1 and increased numbers of cataracts have been reported in cats with diabetes and previous dehydrational episodes. 1 While primary and inherited cataracts are suspected to be rare in cats, cataracts secondary to uveitis or trauma are thought to occur more commonly. 2 Primary cataracts have been documented in various feline breeds including Persian, 3 Himalayan, 4 Russian blue, 5 British shorthair, 6 and Birman. 7 Congenital cataracts in cats have also been described as a manifestation of the Chediak-Higashi syndrome. 8 A recent publication describes cataracts suspected to have a hereditary component in a population of Bengal cats in France. 9 The complications and visual outcome following phacoemulsification have been reported in dogs and horses. In dogs, reported success rates are from 65%-90% over varying time periods: 90% and 65% at 12 and 24 months, respectively, 10 and 82.7% and 79% at a median of 10 and 28 months, respectively. 11, 12 In horses, reported success rates vary from 35%-81%: 81% at a median of 28 days, 13 50% and 35% between 1-6 months and between six to 12 months, respectively, 14, 15 and 54% at a mean 35 months postoperatively. 14 Braus et al evaluated the outcome of surgical treatment of lens laceration in six cats and noted that all had a favorable outcome following surgery, with all patients being visual at the last checkup and with only one patient showing a persistent posterior synechia as minor complication. 16 To the best of the authors' knowledge, no other literature was available on the outcome of lens surgery in cats apart from the paper by Braus et al. The purpose of this study was therefore to assess the clinical findings, complications, and visual outcome of a group of cats following phacoemulsification.",

Stiles (2013) reported that the success rate for cataract surgery in cats appears better than in dogs. 2 Braus et al (2015) concluded that overall, cats appeared to develop less inflammation following lens trauma and lens surgery than did dogs. 16 The results of our retrospective study show an overall success rate of 92.6% for cats that remained within the study with a 12-month follow-up, and 89.5% still visual at the last follow-up (range 6-1898d). POH (42.6%) was the most common complication in the immediate postoperative period. Reports of POH in dogs vary between 37.5%-48.9%, 17, 18 which is comparable to our findings. Another report found that POH in dogs occurred in 22.9% of eyes. 12 The use of carbachol was suggested to be the factor contributing to a lower POH prevalence in that study. 12 Overall, the use of carbachol to reduce POH after phacoemulsification in dogs has shown conflicting results in the literature, and its effect is not clear. 19, 20 The use of carbachol and its effect in diminishing the development of POH in our study was statistically significant. However, the results may have been influenced by the multi-centered nature of the study and the different surgical approaches used by individual surgeons. A prospective study with standardized variables would be required to confirm this finding. Carbachol is thought to prevent or attenuate POH by opening the ciliary cleft, which has been experimentally demonstrated to be collapsed for at least 24 hours following phacoemulsification in dogs. 21 However, Crasta et al (2010) found that the use of carbachol did not prevent POH in dogs and concluded that this variable effect may be due to the fact that ciliary cleft collapse alone is not responsible for POH. 19 Labradors have been reported to experience a significantly increased risk of POH when compared to other breeds. 22 No breed association was evident in our study; however, it may have been significant with a larger number of cases.",

Synechia/dyscoria (25.9%) was another complication at 1-90 days postoperatively; the occurrence was statistically significant between the congenital/ juvenile (16.1%) and trauma (39.3%) groups, being higher in the trauma group. This result correlates with the expected clinical findings, as a damaged iris following trauma and the resultant uveitis/iritis are a common finding in these cases. PCO (36.1%) was the most common complication in the more than 90 days postoperative period. Some studies in dogs have reported PCO as the most common complication after cataract surgery. 24, 25 In our study, PCO was the most common long-term complication, affecting more than one-third cases. The identification and characterization of PCO have limitations; a grading system would have been needed to assess the degree of opacity and the apparent impact on vision.",

            "text": "Glaucoma has been commonly reported as a complication in dogs following cataract surgery, with a prevalence that varies from 6.7% to 28.8%. 9, 24, 26, 27 The glaucomas are a diverse group of diseases united only by the fact that, at least initially, IOP is too high to permit the optic nerve and, in some species, the retina to function normally. 28 Characteristic changes in glaucoma include disrupted axoplasmic flow in the optic nerve head, death of retinal ganglion cells and their axons, cupping of the optic disk, and visual impairment or blindness. 28 Glaucoma was not a common complication in our study. Of the three eyes that were enucleated in the total reviewed cases, only one was enucleated owing to a diagnosis of secondary glaucoma 3.6 years after surgery (but no histology was performed). The referring veterinarian euthanized this same cat 1 year later because of suspected secondary glaucoma in the remaining eye. Only two eyes continued to receive IOP regulating medication at their last follow-up (2/47; 4.2%) but no vision loss was documented. The eyes that received IOP regulating medication during the 1-90 day postoperative period (47/80; 58.7%) did not continue to suffer from an elevated IOP, did not have any reported visual loss, and eventually were tapered off of the medication (apart from the two cases mentioned above). One of the other two enucleated eyes from the trauma group was histologically diagnosed with post-traumatic sarcoma at 620 days after phacoemulsification. Feline ocular sarcomas are malignant intraocular neoplasms that are often associated with a history of ocular trauma. [29] [30] [31] In general, they are locally invasive, potentially metastasize, and usually necessitate enucleation of the affected eye. 32 A report that looked at clinical and morphologic features of post-traumatic sarcoma in cats concluded that the most common consequence was infiltration of the optic nerve, which may extend to the optic chiasm and brain causing blindness and neurological disease. 29 In the cat reported here, the histology report concluded that it was a fairly early stage of the disease with no evidence of scleral or vascular invasion and no extension into the optic nerve. The cat was still alive 3 years after phacoemulsification and 1.3 years after enucleation.",

Another limitation is found in the secondary to uveitis cataract group. In these cases, the cause was already established in the medical records and we cannot rule out that these cats experienced primary cataract formation and lens-induced uveitis. The study involved five different referral centers with different surgeons and no standardization of the treatment protocols. Thirty-four cases were lost to follow-up. The lost to follow-up cases are inherent to the nature of a retrospective study, and this decreases its power; clinically significant statistical differences (type II error) may have been observed in a larger population.",
