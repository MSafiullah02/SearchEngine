These complex physiological reactions proceed coupled to the basic processes of local rupture (exposure of the hydrophobic interior) and deformation (bending) of lipid bilayers (reviewed in Refs. \n[1], [2]). Enveloped animal viruses rely on the fusogenic activity of membrane integral surface glycoproteins to enter and infect their host-cells \n[3], [4], [5], [6], [7], while fission is required for pinching-off of newly assembled virions \n[1]\n. Membrane fission is also operational intracellularly all along virus infectious cycles \n[8]\n. For example trafficking of viral proteins during assembly at the plasma or intracellular membranes and perhaps during intracellular translocation of the capsid complexes is dependent on this process \n[9]\n.",

Class I fusion proteins are all characterized by their capacity to fold into a highly stable 6-helix bundle (6-HB). In this \u201chairpin-like\u201d trimeric structure three helices pack in the reverse direction against hydrophobic grooves outside a triple-stranded coiled-coil, so that the ectodomain amino- and carboxy-termini are placed at the same end of the molecule. It is generally thought that amino-terminal FP sequences insert into the target cell membrane in a \u201cpre-hairpin\u201d stage \n[16], [17], [18]. Subsequent production of the 6-HB would therefore induce close apposition of the viral and cell membranes anchored through the transmembrane domain (TMD) and the FP, respectively. In contrast, class II proteins are composed of antiparallel \u03b2-sheet structures and possess internal FPs \n[4], [12], [15], [19]. Despite these differences, class II proteins have evolved into structures capable of triggering fusion following a mechanism essentially similar to that of class I proteins \n[15], [19], namely, FP insertion into the target membrane and folding into a low-energy trimer that brings into contact TMD- and FP-anchored membranes.",

Moreover, the proximal location of PreTM covalently linked to TMD ensures the high effective concentrations favoring its insertion into membranes. Accordingly, the capacity of PreTM regions for inserting into membranes has been extensively studied in model vesicular systems using representative synthetic peptides. These studies further suggest a putative role of membrane-inserted PreTMs as promoters of lipid bilayer destabilization. In the following sections we review experimental results, obtained in different viral systems, all of which sustain the functional activity of viral PreTMs in fusion\u2013fission, either by transmitting protein conformational energy into membranes, and/or by perturbing lipid bilayer integrity.",

The analysis was performed with the premise that glycoprotein globular ectodomains behave as nonconstitutive membrane proteins, i.e., initially soluble species capable of inserting spontaneously into uncharged cell target membranes in the course of the fusion process. Wimley and White calculated the water-to-membrane interface transfer free energies for each amino acid in the context of unfolded peptide chains (\u0394G\nwiu-s) \n[23], [24]. These free energy values were postulated as a hydrophobicity scale that compiles the energetic components dictating initial partitioning of sequences into membranes, specifically when this occurs in the absence of repulsive or attractive electrostatic interactions. As compared to classical hydropathy indexes based on bulk-phase partitioning of side chain alone, WW \u201cinterfacial hydrophobicity scale\u201d takes into account the effect of the membrane interface on partitioning and includes the energy cost of peptide bond partitioning into it. This originates important differences in residue hydrophobicities, aromatic residues, namely Phe, Tyr and Trp, appearing to be the most hydrophobic ones when located at membrane interfaces.",

Features of HIV-1 and Ebola FP sequences as potential membrane anchors were readily evident upon Kyte\u2013Doolittle (KD) hydropathy analysis \n[28]\n. Thus, KD and WW hydropathy plots displayed positive peaks coincident with the FP sequences. However, a further analysis combining both scales disclosed segregated peaks at the membrane-proximal region of HIV-1 gp41 ectodomain (\nFig. 1\n\nA and Refs. \n[29], [30]). When compared to the KD peak spanning gp41 TMD, the positive maximum detected by WW was shifted 15\u201320 residues towards the N-terminus (continuous red plot in top panel of \nFig. 1\nA). The combined WW\u2013KD analysis thus suggested the existence of a wide nonpolar region (approximately 40\u201350 residues long) at the C-terminus of the gp41 ectodomain (\nTable 1\n\n). This region would be segmented into two domains: one, positioned somewhat farther from the protein C-terminus (residues 664\u2013683 in HIV-1), which would remain stably inserted within the membrane interface (designated as PreTM \n[29]\n), and another one located closer to the C-terminus that constitutes the TMD.",

Computation of the hydrophobic moment using the membrane interface-to-water transfer free energies (\u0394G\niwu) for each amino acid \n[23]\n suggested that gp41 PreTM can be elongated at the N-terminus to include a stretch whose face shows strong affinity for membranes, if folded into an \u03b1-helix (\nFig. 1\nA red-dotted plot in bottom panel).

Moreover, the moment peak shown in \nFig. 1\nA (bottom panel) was present in different HIV-1 isolates and in other lentiviruses thereby suggesting that the N-terminal segment of gp41 PreTM consists in a conserved amphipathic-at-interface sequence, recently designated as AIS \n[34]\n.",

The presence of a hydrophobic-at-interface, aromatic-rich sequence within the fusogenic S2 subunit of SARS coronavirus spike S was already reported \n[39], [40]. The analysis in \nFig. 1\nC adds to this finding the existence of a pattern similar to that previously described for HIV-1 gp41 (panel A). The plots thus indicate that the fully hydrophobic-at-interface SARS S2 PreTM sequence can be elongated at the N-terminus to include an amphipathic-at-interface stretch (see also \nTable 1\n). A comparable but different situation occurs in the case of the Ebola fusion protein. Ebola GP contains within the membrane-proximal region of the GP2 ectodomain an approximately 10aa-long sequence showing a high tendency to partition into membrane interfaces (Ref. \n[31]\n, see also \nTable 1\n). However, computation of the hydrophobic-at-interface moment for this element reflects the existence of a longer amphipathic-at-interface sequence that would span over ca. 17 amino acids (\nTable 1\n).",

These hydrophobic-at-interface residues are inter-dispersed with helical periodicity by charged residues that bear the lowest tendency to partitioning into membrane interfaces (\nTable 1\n). Similarly, aromatic residues at the VSV G PreTM are intervened by stretches with low propensity for partitioning (\nTable 1\n and Ref. \n[43]\n). As a result, in both cases the mean hydrophobicity is low and interfacial moment high, reflecting a propensity for interfacial insertion, but only upon PreTM folding as an \u03b1-helix.",

The N-terminal peak was found to span the conserved amphipathic-at-interface helix or AIS domain \n[34]\n. We observed that a number of blocking deletions invariably correlated with the ablation and/or merging of interfacial subdomains \n[21]\n. An extension of this analysis is displayed in \nFig. 2\nB. Overall free energy of partitioning (left) and interfacial hydrophobicity distribution (right) was plotted vs. fusogenicity of N-terminal subdomain Ala mutants. Free energy of partitioning, computed as the sum of the free energies of the constituent amino acids, correlated linearly with activity of most substitution mutants, but displayed significant activity for \u0394G\niwu = 0, indicating that favorable PreTM partitioning into membranes contributes to, but is not essential for gp41-mediated fusion. In addition, partitioning free energy cannot account for the fusion-inhibitory effects of scrambled SC7 and W(1\u20133)A mutations (hollow symbols). The effect of these mutations on function seems to better correlate with distribution of hydrophobicity into two subdomains (right panel). When hydrophobicity-at-interface peak ratios were plotted vs. fusogenicity, a positive correlation was observed for these and other mutants. This observation supports the functional relevance of distributing interfacial hydrophobicity into two segregated subdomains.",

The potential role of an \u03b1-helical PreTM structure in fusion was tested by deleting two central nonconserved residues, or substituting W672 for with proline. These mutations that would destabilize an \u03b1-helical conformation were found to have no significant effect on gp41 function, therefore arguing against a topological requirement for a helical structure. However, the reduction of the fusogenicity of the glycoprotein observed after scrambling PreTM central residues (mutant SC7) suggests that the clustering of hydrophobic residues in an \u03b1-helical secondary structure may indeed be important, but not essential, for the function of this region.",

These studies were conducted under the assumption that PreTM might represent a second FP, i.e., an additional domain participating in the induction of the viral membrane perturbations required for fusion. Sustaining this notion, lower doses of PreTMp were required to induce fusion and permeabilization of liposomes \n[29], [30]. Moreover, PreTMp-induced restructuring effects were modulated by the main lipids existing in the viral envelope (\nFig. 4\n and Ref. \n[54]\n). Aloia and co-workers \n[56], [57] found in HIV-1 membranes increased Chol-to-phospholipid molar ratios and high levels of sphingomyelin (SPM), ca. 2\u20133 times that of the host-cell surface membranes. These findings were subsequently confirmed using a lipidomic approach \n[58]\n. It is therefore assumed that the HIV-1 membrane is enriched in Chol and SPM, an observation that correlates with the virion selectivity for specific segregated membrane regions through which virions emerge during maturation \n[59]\n.",

Deletion of the 13 stem amino acids (N449 to W461) that span the VSV AIS domain (\nTable 1\n) dramatically reduced cell\u2013cell fusion activity and reduced virus infectivity approximately 100-fold \n[43]\n. However, mutation of conserved aromatic residues responsible for amphipathicity (W457, F458, and W461) either singly or together had only modest effects on cell\u2013cell fusion activity. Notably, PreTM-TMD-cytoplasmic tail constructs (GS) expressed in cells could also potentiate the membrane fusion activity of heterologous viral fusion proteins \n[68]\n. For some fusion proteins, there was as much as a 40-fold increase in syncytium formation when GS was coexpressed compared to that seen when the fusion protein was expressed alone. Fusion potentiation by GS was not protein specific, since it occurred with both pH-dependent as well as pH-independent fusion proteins. Truncation mutations indicated that the complete VSV AIS was required for fusion potentiation. Together, these data support the hypothesis that the PreTM domain contributes to VSV G-mediated membrane fusion activity and functions as a fusogenic unit, yet the conserved aromatic residues seem to be not essential for membrane fusion or infectivity in the context of the assembled virus.",

Following a pattern similar to that previously described for HIV PreTMp, the presence of the raft-associated lipid sphingomyelin did not affect membrane insertion, but it stimulated highly the membrane-destabilizing capacity of Ebola PreTMp. The SPM effect seemed to not arise from an intrinsic instability of the vesicles, since the scrambled control sequence could not induce leakage at any tested dose even though it interacted with liposomes.

Compelling evidence that sustains suitability of FP function as a target for inhibitor development has been again obtained in the case of HIV-1. Early studies showed that oligopeptides homologous in sequence to the FP were indeed capable of inhibiting gp41-induced fusion \n[85], [86], [87], [88]. Also supporting this view we have recently identified gp41 inhibitors from a d-amino acid hexapeptide library, based on their capacity to block synthetic FPp in vitro \n[89]\n, and Munch et al. \n[90]\n have isolated a naturally produced oligopeptide targeting FP that was able to block HIV-1 infection. Thus, force-transmitting sequences emerge as alternative therapeutic targets \n[90], [91].",

C8 activity was found to be dependent on conservation of the Trp motif, most likely because these residues are responsible for its conformational propensity.

In contrast, 4E10 did not greatly affect PreTMp-induced perturbations in PC:SPM vesicles, most likely because PreTMp surface gets occluded in the transmembrane pores responsible for permeabilization of this type of vesicles \n[54], [103]. Recognition at membrane interfaces was also made evident by fluorescence microscopy of lipid monolayers transferred onto glass coverslips \n[103]\n. In these experiments, addition of Mab4E10 was shown to induce surface clustering of PreTMp sequence in presence of Chol, but not in its absence. It was concluded that a putative mechanism of gp41 blocking might be based on Mab4E10 capacity for rendering cross-linked spikes incompetent for fusion.",

A possibility is that fusion is actually restrained by PreTM-induced positive curvature (committed state) until the process is activated.

These roles are likely to depend on its folding as an interfacial \u03b1-helix, which binds Chol, self-assembles in a raft environment, and is endowed with the capacity of restructuring this type of membranes. Indeed, most if not all PreTM mutants described by Salzwedel et al. dramatically affected incorporation of glycoprotein into virions \n[44]\n. These authors were the first to propose that one possible role for the conserved tryptophan residues in enhancing the incorporation of glycoprotein into virions could involve an interaction with cholesterol. Subsequently reported experimental evidence supports this notion \n[61], [62], [63], [64]. Such interactions could facilitate the enrichment of glycoprotein within plasma membrane raft-domains through which the virus might bud \n[59]\n, or even be employed in generating Chol-rich domains \n[62], [117]. Thus, PreTM might function as a raft-sensor to pilot Env protein to budding sites during viral assembly. Furthermore, specific folding and self-association within a Chol-enriched raft environment might be crucial for gp41 function \n[56], [118], [119], [120], [121].",

It is tempting to speculate that clusters of inserted PreTMs might be initially responsible for the induction of local positive curvature within laterally segregated areas of the external viral membrane monolayer. As a matter of fact, electron tomography of intact virions reveals spikes distributed forming clusters of at least seven members \n[36]\n, and clusters of rod-shaped proteins at the focal points where the actual membrane merger develops \n[122]\n. Within these distinct areas, monolayer intrinsic curvatures could hypothetically change their sign upon PreTM desorption, thus facilitating fusion pore opening.",

Sustaining this notion HIV-1 PreTMp partitions into POPC or POPC:SPM membranes but is only fusogenic when Chol is added to the lipid composition (\nFig. 4\n and Ref. \n[54]\n). Chol requirement actually supports that the membrane-restructuring processes observed in liposomes are indeed bona fide reflection of a gp41 PreTM physiological role \n[118], [121] (\nFig. 4\n). Moreover, PreTMp membrane activity is affected by blocking mutations (\nFig. 2\n), occurs at membrane doses relevant for spike density (\nFig. 4\n) and is inhibited by neutralizing antibodies (\nFig. 5\n). Attending to data reported in the literature, such an intrinsic membrane-perturbing activity could be a general feature of viral PreTMs \n[21], [29], [30], [31], [39], [40], [41], [54], [60], [70], [79], [124], [125], [126].

Just the MPER stem region is potentially exposed to solvent \n[112], [127]. Thus, the probability of neutralization by binding to MPER epitopes might be reduced by two complementary mechanisms: i) limiting the envelope spike number (i.e., reduction of binding-sites and concomitant avidity decrease), and ii) occluding MPER epitopes into the interface of the viral external membrane monolayer (affinity decrease). Long aromatic-rich PreTM might play a central role in driving both effects. In one hand, as discussed before, its capacity to self-associate at the raft-like membrane surface would buttress the reduction of the number of spikes at the viral surface required for fusion. On the other, its high degree of hydrophobicity-at-interface ensures embedding of stem epitope sequences into the membrane, thereby occluding key residues for recognition and/or inducing membrane-specific secondary structure.",
