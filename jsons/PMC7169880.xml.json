However, the standard 30-35-fraction schedule, in the context of concurrent chemotherapy toxicity and poor baseline pulmonary health of many NSCLC patients, represents a significant exposure and complication risk from COVID-19, as well as heavy resource utilization. A schedule of 55Gy in 20 fractions is already widely used in the United Kingdom, and prospective data suggest that concurrent chemotherapy with this regimen is not associated with excessive toxicity.(4,5) Though individualized clinical judgment always applies, , the benefit of curtailing treatment by two-plus weeks justifies considering 55Gy in 20 fractions the default chemoradiation schedule under pandemic circumstances. Spinal cord dose should be limited to 44Gy with this schedule; patients with particularly extensive nodal involvement requiring irradiation of \u226512cm of the esophagus should receive standard fractionation.(5)",

Though not a validated approach, patients with a targetable driver mutation (sensitizing EGFR mutation, ALK rearrangement, etc.) could also considered for induction systemic therapy as a temporizing measure. In the meantime, hypofractionated schedules are strongly preferred for radiotherapy without concurrent chemotherapy, particularly a 15-fraction schedule. Retrospective data suggest that outcomes after 45Gy in 15 fractions are equivalent to 60Gy in 30 fractions, and this schedule has been endorsed in an ASTRO clinical practice guideline.(6,7) Within the framework of this 15-fraction schedule, selective dose-escalation to doses as high as 60Gy may be considered; this dose is currently being investigated in locally advanced NSCLC patients not receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy in NRG Oncology LU-004.(8)",

Nevertheless, significant evidence, as well as oncologic first principles (particularly in the case of positive margins), justify preserving the ability to deliver PORT(9, 10, 11). ASTRO guidelines recommend doses of 54-60Gy for margin-positive disease and 50-54Gy for margin-negative disease, in 1.8Gy-2.0Gy fractions.(12) Choosing the lowest doses and shortest schedules consistent with these guidelines (50Gy in 2.0Gy fractions) is recommended at this time. Patients in a postoperative state may be at heightened risk for morbidity or mortality from COVID-19, and as such, limiting target volumes to involved regions (positive nodal stations and staple line only) is also prudent. Hypofractionation in the postoperative setting has been associated with more toxicity and is thus not encouraged.(13)",

Though this remains the standard, daily treatment such as 66-70Gy in 33-35 fractions appears substantially equivalent.(16) Hyperfractionation vs. daily fractionation under pandemic conditions raises the question of whether minimizing overall treatment length, or length of a given treatment day, is preferred. This choice, in turn, may depend on facility-specific factors such as the effectiveness of the facility\u2019s COVID-19 precautions, and its logistical ability to deliver two daily fractions at least six hours apart. Overall, we believe that minimizing overall treatment length is more important and recommend standard twice-daily treatment to 45Gy. One potential adaptation, albeit one without as direct supporting evidence, is the conversion of this regimen to once-daily fractionation (45 Gy in 15 daily fractions), which, as noted above, is well-established for NSCLC. However, as the NSCLC data applies to patients not receiving concurrent chemotherapy, and SCLC disease is often bulky and central, we would consider this a measure of last resort for carefully selected patients under conditions of imminent resource restriction, and we have not moved to this fractionation at our facility at this time.",

The standard dose of PCI remains 25Gy in 10 fractions. However, prospective data from extensive-stage patients suggest that deferring PCI in favor of close MRI surveillance can achieve equivalent outcomes without the neurocognitive risks of brain radiation\u2014and in these circumstances, without exposure risk to COVID-19.(19) Therefore, we suggest that risks and benefits of PCI be carefully discussed with all eligible SCLC patients including limited-stage, and that strong consideration during pandemic conditions be given to MRI surveillance as an alternative. This is particularly true for extensive-stage disease, where the benefits of PCI are more questionable and which represents an incurable condition regardless. For extensive-stage patients receiving PCI, a shorter regimen of 20Gy in 5 fractions could be considered.(20)",

Radiotherapy departments will be confronted with excruciating decisions about how to alter treatment recommendations and even withhold treatment entirely, given the additional risks of delivering radiation under these circumstances and the potential that radiotherapy resources will be sharply curtailed. Urgently considering and adopting guidelines such as these is imperative for our field, so that we can not only maintain our commitment to treat life-threatening malignancies, but protect the health of all patient-facing radiation staff, and help preserve the availability and integrity of health services for society as a whole.",
