In dogs, the role of this agent in diarrhea is incompletely characterized, and it remains controversial whether C. difficile is a primary or secondary agent [2,3]. It is commonly described as a community-acquired enteropathogen responsible for acute canine hemorrhagic diarrhea, but it is also reported by some authors as a cause of chronic disorders in dogs [[4], [5], [6], [7]]. The predisposing factors associated with C. difficile infection (CDI) in dogs remain largely unknown. Antibiotic therapy is, so far, the only known risk factor for C. difficile colonization in dogs [8,9]. In the present work, five cases of chronic-recurring diarrhea in dogs with CDI have been reported. These animals did not respond to metronidazole therapy, but recovered after dietary changes.",

C. difficile has been reported in some studies to be one of the possible bacterial agents [2,[4], [5], [6]], although no studies to date have confirmed this hypothesis [3]. It is recognized that disruption of the gut microbiota is the main predisposing factor for colonization by C. difficile [8], and recent studies have shown dysbiosis in dogs with many gastrointestinal diseases including chronic diarrhea [15]. One known consequence of gut dysbiosis is alteration in bile acids, which can facilitate the germination of C. difficile spores [16,17]. In the present study, five dogs with chronic-recurring diarrhea were diagnosed with CDI. In one animal (dog 1), eosinophilic inflammation of the colon was confirmed via biopsy. This condition is commonly reported in dogs with food allergies and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [18,19]. Thus, it seems reasonable to hypothesize that dysbiosis associated with eosinophilic inflammation might have led to C. difficile colonization and toxin production in this case. Curiously, human patients with IBD and other inflammatory conditions, including celiac disease, are known to have a higher incidence of CD [[20], [21], [22]].",

Interestingly, AD was recently implicated in dysbiosis and intestinal inflammation in dogs [23]. Unfortunately, these diagnoses were determined at other institutions, and there is limited information on the protocols used. Food allergy can cause skin lesions that are identical to those of AD, and thus, it is possible that the chronic-recurring diarrhea and skin lesions observed in these animals were associated only with food allergy. It is also possible that AD and food-responsive diarrhea occurred concomitantly, as previously described in other studies on dogs [24,25]. In addition, it is important to note that dog 1 developed CDI around one month after starting treatment with cyclosporine. Diarrhea is commonly reported after treatment with cyclosporine in human patients, and some cases are associated with CDI. Nonetheless, this symptom usually disappears when the use of cyclosporine is interrupted or after antibiotic treatment for CDI [26], which is in contrast to our results with dog 1.",

Moreover, a diagnosis of food-responsive diarrhea is usually determined by response to treatment after the exclusion of other causes, including CDI [27]. In this situation, it is possible that diarrhea occurring after treatment in dogs diagnosed with CDI could be wrongly considered as refractory or recurring CDI; however, the present work suggested that C. difficile colonization was secondary to other causes. In addition, although it is not always possible to diagnose CDI in clinics, the protocols for the treatment of chronic-recurring canine diarrhea commonly include dietary modifications in combination with antibacterial therapy [28,29]. Thus, it is possible that cases of food-responsive CDI are underdiagnosed.",
