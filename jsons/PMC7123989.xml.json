This unicellular alga, Spirulina has a thin thread like elongated structure and classified under Cyanobacteriaceae which is blue green in colour.

Pollution-free medium with abundant sunlight and moderate temperature is favourable for growth of Spirulina. However, they can also sustain and adapt harsher environmental condition. Spirulina can be referred as a complete nutritionalfood supplement, being a rich source of many important nutrients, including protein, carbohydrates, iron and vitamins like A, K and B complex. Most of the dry weight of this unicellular alga is protein which is very essential for growth and regeneration. It is a better substitute for meat and dairy products which are rich infatty acid and cholesterol. A few grams of Spirulina intake can fulfill our everyday requirement of protein, iron and vitamins, especially vitamins A in form of beta carotene, B complex, D and K. Spirulina though contains no vitamin C, but it helps maintain potency of vitamin C. Spirulina has great antioxidant properties incurred by its yellow xanthophyll content. Thus, Spirulina can be a wise option to be used as a dietary supplement to maintain good health and resist several diseases.",

            "text": "Sequencing of whole genome opened up the way to use genes from higher plants as probes (Amao and Nakamura, 2006) to identify and clone cyanobacterial genes involved in photosynthesis. Subsequently, many cyanobacterial photosynthetic mutants were possible to create by genetic manipulations conducted by Ruengjitchatchawalya et al. (2002) and Cao et al. (1999). They created some genetically engineered strains which can efficiently produce organic substances. One advantage of cyanobacteria is that they use solar energy, CO2, H2O and inorganic substances as efficiently as higher plants. This feature can be exploited for production of useful organic products with minimum expenditure of resources and energy. A few decades ago Kuhlemeier et al. (1981) reported some expression vectors for Anacystis nidulans R2. Later, Kurdrid et al. (2011) developed cyanobacterial host vector systems to analyze the expression and structure function relation of the genes. One major advantage of Spirulina is its simpler growth requirements than other bacteria and is nonpathogenic. Therefore, the mass culture of Spirulina sp. can be performed efficiently (Vonshak, 1997). Because of these characteristics, many attempts to express foreign genes in Spirulina sp. have been made. One enzyme called human carbonic anhydrase, responsible for inter conversion of carbon dioxide and bicarbonate to maintain acid-base balance in blood and other tissues and removing extra carbon dioxide out of tissues and another called Mn superoxide dismutase from E. coli were cloned and expressed by Cao et al. in cyanobacteria. In this chapter an effort has been made to summarise ongoing global research on the most efficient conditions for expression of the valuable genes of Spirulina sp. in other organisms and also research on how genes from other organisms can be cloned and expressed in Spirulina. The problems in engineering Spirulina and its probable solution have also been discussed.",

Beneficial microorganisms increase absorption and assimilation of nutrients from the foods we eat, and helps to protect against infection. It also acts as a natural cleanser by removing mercury and other lethaltoxins ingested by the body. Spirulina also increases stamina and immunity levels in athletes, and its high protein content helps to build muscle mass.

Some molecules which may harm human system and are absorbed by the body through pollution, poor diet, injury, or stress may also be eliminated with the help of these micronutrients. By removing free radicals, the nutrients help the immune system fight cancer and cellular degeneration. In some experimental findings, Spirulina sp. was found effective in regression of oral cancer in laboratory animals, and may pave way incancer treatment. Spirulina sp. also can reduce low density lipoproteins (LDL) which are associated with severe cardiovascular disorders like atherosclerosis and strokes. LDL sticks to inner wall of the arteries and get hardened thus blocking the normal blood flow. Spirulina can lower the LDL accumulation in the body and helps prevent the many cardiovascular problems.

With the rapid advances of genome sequencing technologies, gene sequences of various microalgae was published and large-scale approaches have been developed to utilize the sequence information into functional information. Generally, function of any gene can be derived using various approaches, such as analysis of gene expression pattern by promoter activity assay, gene silencing, ectopic expression, structure-function analysis, protein sub-cellular localization examination, and in vitro or in vivo biochemical assays (Kumar and Hirochika, 2001; Curtis and Grossniklaus, 2003). The conventional method for engineering an expression vector construct depends on the restriction digestion of a suitable DNA fragment followed by ligation. This method is time consuming and is dependent on availability of appropriate restriction sites. This is a significant technical barrier for large-scale functional gene analysis studies. Recently, the Gateway cloning system has been developed to facilitate large-scale production of gene constructs, and it is able to achieve rapid cloning of one or more genes into multiple destination vectors using site-specific recombination. The recombination cloning system is based on a two-step process (Earley et al., 2006). Firstly, the desired DNA fragment is cloned into a general donor vector by \u201cGATEWAY\u201d \u2013 BP reaction. Then, the DNA fragment flanked by twosite-specific recombination sites (attB1 and attB2) in the donor plasmid can be transferred precisely into a variety of expression vectors by site-specific recombination reactions. Once the DNA product is targeted into a donor vector, the transfer of the DNA constructs into an expression destination vector which becomes simple and requires no traditional restriction enzyme/ligase cloning. This Gateway technology have been widely used in the research community, and many Gateway-compatible open reading frame clone collections and expression plasmids have been created for functional genomic analysis in many organisms.",

In some cases, transformation resulted in the successful and stable expression of transgenes from either the nucleus or the plastid, but in most cases, only transient expression was observed. So far lot of research has been performed to increase the lipid yield of microalgae through optimization of growth and induction conditions, such as temperature, light intensity and duration, salt concentration, and nutrient requirement, while genetic modifications of microalgae to alter quantity, quality or composition of lipid are reported less. The main reason is probably the lack of a generally applicable transformation protocol for microalgae. Since microalgae are such a diverse group of organisms, it cannot be guaranteed that a method that works for one species could be applied to another one. Some antibiotics routinely used in the transformation of plants, such as kanamycin and zeocin, have been successfully used as markers in cyanobacterial gene manipulation. Also, heterologous gene expression in microalgae demands for preferential codon usage and appropriate promoter sequences to modulate each expression. This can be achieved by getting information on completely annotated and sequenced microalgal genomes. Any protocol for the genetic transformation of a microalgal strain needs to be customized to meet its specific requirements and overcome corresponding limitations.",
