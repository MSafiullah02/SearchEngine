            "text": "In most sales settings, boundaries between personal and work time have become largely non-existent. Technological advances and customer expectations for immediate responses make it difficult for salespeople to \u201cunplug\u201d from the near obligation to address client and manager demands in real-time. This technology-driven destruction of the already unclear boundaries of sales is pervasive and is expected to escalate as artificial intelligence and myriad enablement tools increase customer and manager expectations (Singh et al., 2019). Prior research indicates the lack of separation between work and personal matters has costs to the salesperson, as workplace stress routinely invades her/his personal life (i.e., work-to-family conflict, Boles et al., 1997, Boles et al., 2003, Darrat et al., 2010). In addition, a recent Forbes article (Beheshti, 2019) reports that mental health suffers when work stress permeates personal life, with reports of unhealthy coping behaviors (50%), poor sleep (67%), and a fear of missing work to deal with stress (67%). Yet, very little is known about the opposite dynamic, where demands of personal stress cross the almost non-existent boundaries of the sales workplace contributing to salesperson burnout and reductions in performance. Thus, we investigate the impact of personal stress that in a connected, social, and dynamic society affects the sales workplace where it counts \u2013 across salesperson wellbeing and performance.",

Given recent changes to work and personal habits hastened by health concerns, most employees have experienced some mix of business and home life. While conducting remote work from home offers many benefits, little is known of its impact on the worker\u2019s long-term well-being. Given these changes, we surmise that stress from both home and work is more likely than ever to mix, causing new and unforeseen problems for managers and employees. However, given the lack of literature on the specific impact of personal stressors on work outcomes, scholarly research does not address what this increasing practice may ultimately do to worker well-being. Therefore, our research on the effects of personal stress on the workplace is timely and salient to current issues.",

In their research on salesperson burnout, Lewin and Sager (2007) identify that both the boundary-spanning (where firm and customer demands must be met) and frequently ambiguous nature of the sales role make salespeople highly likely to experience stress and burnout. Further, Ambrose, Rutherford, Shepherd, and Tashchian (2014) add that the parameters of the sales role make it distinct from non-sales workplace research. For example, salespeople are typically incentivized and compensated on personal achievement (e.g., revenue or percentage of quota), which differentiates them from workers compensated on group goals (e.g., task, team, or firm performance). Thus, for salespeople, individual motivation is among the strongest determinants of sales performance (Miao & Evans, 2007). Yet, the American Psychological Association\u2019s report on Stress in America (APA, 2018) attests that common personal stressors (e.g., financial issues impact 64% and health concerns impact 63% of adults) reduce motivation. For Generation Z, which represents future workforce entrants, personal stress is more pervasive (finances: 81% and health concerns: 75%). Thus, personal stress is expected to have negative effects on salespeople as they become less motivated (i.e., burned out) to meet their performance goals.",

Prior work has investigated interrole conflict that causes stress from family-related activity to influence other settings. Specifically, interrole conflict is defined as a situation where \u201cthe role pressures from the work and family domains are mutually incompatible in some respect. That is, participation in the work (family) role is made more difficult by virtue of participation in the family (work) role\u201d (Greenhaus & Beutell, 1985, pg. 77). Thus, stressors in the home (e.g., a sick child) can cause conflict in the workplace (e.g., salesperson cannot attend a client meeting). However, investigation of specific personal stressors and their role in the sales workplace is absent from prior research on family-to-work conflict and stress. Thus, our research question is \u201chow do specific personal stressors impact salespeople and their performance?\u201d",

We model the three most prominent personal stressors (financial, health, and relationship; APA, 2015) as antecedent demands that drive salesperson burnout (emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and diminished personal accomplishment). We then validate our research model by connecting the burnout dimensions to salesperson performance. Thus, our research addresses a salient gap in the literature, as we test our model with a sample of 331 B2B salespeople from across a variety of industries to provide widely applicable research findings.",

In so doing, we extend the tenets of JD-R based on COR theory to investigate how personal demands affect salesperson workplace outcomes. Our results offer interesting insights for managers of salespeople, and though not all personal stress and burnout dimensions interact the same, the evidence shows that personal stress plays a prominent role in the formation of burnout. Overall, the present manuscript contributes to scholarship by advancing that personal stress can have a significant impact on the salesperson and his/her sales performance. In response, managers should consider ways to develop adaptive work cultures, employee assistance programs, and/or empathy for salespeople dealing with personal issues.",

Job demands typically drive negative outcomes, such as burnout or turnover based on the effort required to address them (Demerouti, Nachreiner, Bakker, & Schaufeli, 2001). These psychological costs are prevalent in sales, with demands such as increasing market and product complexity, relationships, and competition all vying for the limited time and energy resources of salespeople (e.g., Hartmann et al., 2018, Plouffe et al., 2016, Schmitz and Ganesan, 2014).",

Job resources are physical, psychological, social, or organizational components of a job that function to help salespeople achieve work goals, reduce job demands (and costs), and/or stimulate learning (Demerouti et al., 2001). Proper use of job resources improves work engagement and performance (Bakker & Demerouti, 2007). Of interest to the sales setting is the concept of personal resources. Given the individual and personal motivation nature of sales, we expect that salespeople draw upon many resources from within their inner-self. To this end, personal resources are defined as malleable, positive self-evaluations rooted in a salesperson\u2019s resiliency and ability to influence the immediate environment (Hobfoll et al., 2003, Xanthopoulou et al., 2009). For example, the personal resources of self-efficacy, self-esteem, and optimism have been shown to act as buffers within the workplace (Xanthopoulou Bakker, Demerouti, & Schaufeli, 2007). In addition, the moderating role of compassion satisfaction (a personal resource) was established on the relationship between job demands and job strain outcomes (Tremblay & Messervey, 2011). Thus, a salesperson\u2019s personal resources help to offset workplace stress driven by overwhelming demands.",

Prior literature on family-to-work conflict describes stressors that spill over from the personal domain into the work domain (Greenhaus & Beutell, 1985). The spillover of demands from family-to-work has a negative effect at work, as it has a positive relationship with workplace burnout and a negative relationship with performance (Amstad, Meier, Fasel, Elfering, & Semmer, 2011). However, specific examples of where personal demands have been described in a JD-R context are not found within the JD-R literature. Yet, many similarities of the personal demands described in the family-to-work conflict literature relate closely to the concepts of JD-R. This oversight is interesting, as personal resources (not demands) have been introduced to the study of JD-R theory (Xanthopoulou et al., 2007, Xanthopoulou et al., 2009). Thus, we provide a contribution to the literature by extending JD-R theory to account for the spillover of specific personal demands (stressors) expected to play a role within the sales workplace.",

            "text": "To guide our development and extension of JD-R via including personal demands in the model, we next look to key aspects of COR theory. COR is based on the interaction of an individual with her/his environment. When the demands of an environment exceed an individual\u2019s ability to cope, they produce stress (Hobfoll, 1989). To offset demands, much like the dynamic explained by JD-R, personal resources are utilized to offset the negative effects, such as burnout, of conflicting situations that cause stress (Hobfoll &Freedy, 2017). A personal resource in the context of COR is anything important to an individual that helps her/him to improve wellbeing and adjust to the environment (Hobfoll, 1989). Personal resources include values, personality, and coping skills developed via experience. Thus, in our study of salespeople, we expect that personal resources play a role because these workers are faced with challenging situations (e.g., rejection, lost sales, and competition) that require coping and resilience (Dugan, Hochstein, Rouzious, & Britton, 2019). Overall, COR suggests that stress from an environment causes the loss of resources as energy and resilience are exhausted and that individuals tend to focus on and respond to the loss of resources more than the gain of positive inputs (Hobfoll, 1989). COR offers two additional salient tenets, resource spirals and caravans, that relate to salespeople, the formation of burnout, and stress.",

A resource spiral is described as the notion that as losses accumulate, they will \u201cspiral\u201d in a downward direction, where, \u201closs begets further loss\u201d (Hobfoll, 2001, p. 354). Conversely, positive gains can \u201ccaravan\u201d and build upon one another, leading to improved confidence that drives future confidence, or improved performance \u201ccaravanning\u201d to drive future performance gains (Hobfoll, 2001). These concepts pertain to salespeople, as personal stress, spilling over into the workplace, represents a true loss of resources (e.g., weakened health state, unfocused thoughts due to a relationship break-up, or paranoia of failure due to financial trouble) that can spiral as problems accumulate. In these states, personal stress demands are capable of driving workplace burnout and thus, reducing workplace performance. Drawing upon these concepts of COR theory, we suggest that JD-R theory can be broadened to include personal demands that affect the workplace, as well as demands inherent within the workplace. We offer this suggestion within the scope of the sales workplace, which provides a unique setting that offers little distinction between personal and work environments.",

According to Maslach, Jackson, Leiter, Schaufeli, and Schwab (1986), burnout is considered to be a syndrome whose constituent dimensions include emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and diminished personal accomplishment. Emotional exhaustion arises as a function of the stress experienced by salespeople resulting from job-related demands. Specifically, emotional exhaustion results from an imbalance between the amount of resources a salesperson has for dealing with occupational demands, and the magnitude of the demands. Diminished personal accomplishment pertains to the gradual attenuation of a salesperson\u2019s sense of competency and ability to excel. In sales, diminished personal accomplishment is clearly identifiable, as sales revenue is often the primary indicator of salesperson performance, which objectively reports decreases in outcomes that may be related to decreases in perceived effectiveness and competence (Lewin and Sager, 2007, Maslach et al., 1986). Depersonalization generally manifests as a salesperson\u2019s cynical and calloused disposition toward clients/customers, coworkers, and/or managers. Depersonalization is marked by a lack of \u201chumanity\u201d in how one frames his/her interactions with others.

Regarding outcomes, emotional exhaustion reduces salesperson performance (Babakus, Cravens, Johnston, & Moncrief, 1999), job satisfaction (Mulki, Jaramillo, & Locander, 2006), and increases turnover intentions (Boles et al., 1997).

However, with only a few exceptions (e.g., Ambrose et al., 2014, Rutherford et al., 2015), most sales research has investigated burnout without taking into account the sequencing of its sub-dimensions. Thus, the norm across extant literature is to model the burnout dimensions individually, where paths between the burnout dimensions are not estimated (Edmondson, Matthews, & Ambrose, 2019). In fact, most sales research doesn\u2019t measure all of the burnout dimensions, but rather focuses exclusively on emotional exhaustion, neglecting the investigation of models that represent all three dimensions (Rutherford, Hamwi, Friend, & Hartmann, 2011a). Given the variance in how burnout is tested in sales research, and the scope of our research as it investigates personal stressors as antecedent conditions of the three dimensions, we do not model the sequencing of the burnout dimensions. However, we do suggest that future research on personal stress and burnout should explore potential moderators along with a process model that accounts for the sequential effects of the burnout sub-dimensions. Addressing our objective, our research adds to the literature by modeling all of the burnout dimensions and the antecedent relationships of personal stress (health, relationship, and financial), which are next described.",

Health issues are a concern for all people, with most regularly experiencing some personal (or extended family member) health problems. For minor or routine health concerns, health stress is likely to remain low, as these types of events are manageable and expected (de Frias & Whyne, 2015). For example, a weekend athlete is inconvenienced by a knee injury or a parent experiences manageable stress when a child has strep throat. These health concerns are addressed by coping mechanisms, such as a focus on recovery and an expected return to normal health (Doron, Trouillet, Maneveau, Neveu, & Ninot, 2014). However, more serious and debilitating health concerns can exceed one\u2019s ability to cope (de Frias & Whyne, 2015). For instance, an individual\u2019s stage IV cancer diagnosis or an aging parent with Alzheimer\u2019s disease are examples of serious health concerns that do not have expectations of guaranteed recovery or a clear path toward a return to normal functionality. Thus, increases in health-related stress result from serious health concerns (Chang & Yu, 2013).",

Whether the serious health concern is for the individual or a loved one, trips to medical clinics, complex treatment plans, and rehabilitation exercises all place demands on the patient or caregiver. Applying the JD-R concept to the demands of personal health stress that spillover from the personal domain to the work domain, we expect that as personal health stress increases it will have a negative impact. Specifically, we predict that salespeople will experience increases in burnout due to personal health stress because the pressures of the sales environment can be unrelenting. For example, sales quotas, customer orders, and important contract negotiations often are time-sensitive and deemed critical to maintaining a salesperson\u2019s income and employment. Thus, personal health stress is an added demand that permeates the sales workplace as it is addressed and managed by salespeople who are already experiencing traditional work stress.

Drawing upon Wheaton (1994), we describe personal relationship stress as a state that develops when close relationships become severely distressed, or when they are discontinued. Stress is inherent in relationships, as natural tension exists between individuals with competing and divergent demands, attitudes and needs (Ledermann, Bodenmann, Rudaz, & Bradbury, 2010). However, normal relationship stress is typically handled through \u201cgive and take\u201d between partners, leading to convergent thinking and consensus, which strengthens bonds (Cutrona & Russell, 1987). However, personal relationship stress represents what happens when the demands of a relationship exceed the ability of one, or both partners to adjust. In these situations, the relationship can become unhealthy/undesired, causing higher, less manageable levels of stress to form (Wheaton, 1994). This form of stress can be short-term or long-term, as situations can improve, worsen, or end, leading to an eventual reduction in personal relationship stress via distance and time. Personal relationship stress can also be pervasive, as marital, parental, and sibling relationships have an enduring long-term nature. High levels of both short-term and long-term personal relationship stress can demand salesperson attention and cause emotional strain, negatively affecting workplace performance (Israel, House, Schurman, Heaney, & Mero, 1989).",

In the past, pursuing work goals has provided a reprieve from the stress of home-based relationships. However, today the loss or purposeful avoidance of habitual social media and messaging due to relationship stress can cause depression and impact the salesperson\u2019s workday (Brugha, 1984). For example, a salesperson dating in a long-term relationship is likely to form a habit of \u201cchecking-in\u201d and sharing stories of their day with their significant other. When the relationship ends, or is distressed, not conducting this routine can cause higher levels of stress and keep its loss prominent, demanding cognitive and emotional resources of the salesperson (Chambers, 2013). Applying JD-R to the demands of personal relationship stressors that spillover from the personal domain to the work domain, we predict that salespeople will experience increases in burnout due to the stress caused by either severe tension or loss of personal relationships. Salespeople typically manage a variety of business relationships (Plouffe et al., 2016), thus problems in personal relationships are expected to demand resources that are already constrained. We expect personal relationship stress will lead to increases in the dimensions of salesperson burnout. Formally,",

Building on Wheaton (1994), we define personal financial stress as a state that develops when personal finances become a problem for the individual, or between individuals, to the point that one has a strong sense of \u201cowing too much,\u201d or feeling overwhelmed by debt. This form of stress is intuitive and basic to human existence, as having sufficient resources to provide for oneself and/or family is related to the most rudimentary of human physiological needs (Maslow, 1943). Having financial problems, and the disagreements they cause with a partner manifests in a variety of ways. For example, individuals with high levels of financial stress experience greater rates of poor sleep quality (Hall et al., 2008), high blood pressure (Steptoe, Brydon, & Kunz-Ebrecht, 2005), and reduced well-being (Agrigoroaei, Lee-Attardo, & Lachman, 2017). For most, finances are an ongoing problem causing stress, as 78% of Americans live on the financial edge (i.e., paycheck to paycheck, see Hayes, 2017) and 57% have insufficient financial resources to cover an unexpected $500 emergency (Picchi, 2017). While salespeople can rank among the highest paid employees, many struggle to meet quotas and earn the commissions they expect to fit their lifestyles. Thus, demands caused by personal financial stress are applicable to the sales environment, despite the possibility of higher earning potential.",

Research has linked financial stress to higher levels of general worker stress (Bailey, Woodiel, Turner, & Young, 1998), reduced productivity (Kim & Garman, 2004), and absenteeism (Kim, Sorhaindo, & Garman, 2006). One recent, preliminary study, directly related to the present research, found that the personal financial stress of physicians has a high correlation with workplace burnout (Porter et al., 2018). In a sales setting, the demands of personal financial stress are expected to be greater than those of general work settings. Salespeople typically work in outcome and commission-based compensation models (Ingram, LaForge, Schwepker, Williams, 2007). While this type of compensation plan allows for greater income, it also has some downsides. For example, many salespeople translate short-term financial gains (e.g., a big sale) to justify extravagant purchases and financial commitments (e.g., larger houses, expensive cars, and vacations) without planning for future downturns. Unfortunately, financial setbacks can also occur, with economic and market issues often quickly and severely changing a salesperson\u2019s financial situation. In other words, possessing a high earning capacity has the potential to bring about heightened life satisfaction, but does not always increase happiness or reduce stress (Kahneman & Deaton, 2010). Thus, we expect that the demands of financial stress will burden salespeople in addition to their normal work demands, as they attempt to earn more to meet prior obligations. Formally,",

Thus, we hypothesize and test that each of the dimensions has a negative impact on sales performance. Emotional exhaustion has received the most scholarly attention of the burnout dimensions, and its relationship with reduced sales performance has been well established (e.g., Babakus et al., 1999, Matthews et al., 2016; Rutherford, Park, & Han, 2011b; Edmondson et al., 2019). However, the remaining dimensions have received less attention, with both diminished personal accomplishment and depersonalization remaining understudied in the sales literature (Hollet-Haudebert et al., 2011).

Health stress, relationship stress, and financial stress were measured using items (three items each) that were adapted from Turner, Wheaton, and Lloyd (1995) research on social stress. There were three primary reasons for limiting the personal stress question items for each stressor. First, we only used items related to the three stressors in our study. Second, we sought to condense chronic stressors that are highly personal and similar into fewer questions that respondents were more likely to answer honestly. For example, instead of asking two separation questions, \u201cwas there a marital separation or divorce\u201d and \u201cdid a romantic relationship recently end,\u201d we only asked the latter because not all respondents were likely to be married. Further, we did not expect respondents to appreciate or answer honestly questions such as \u201cyour sexual needs are not fulfilled by this relationship,\u201d thus these types of questions were not used. We followed the same procedure for health and financial stress, condensing items and avoiding more sensitive items, leaving three items to capture the construct.",

The use of self-reported measures of salesperson performance is common practice across sales research (e.g., Micevski et al., 2019, Groza et al., 2016, Rutherford et al., 2015, Jones et al., 2007).

Additionally, research juxtaposing objective and self-reported salesperson performance data have found the two to be significantly correlated (Sharma, Rich, & Levy, 2004). With regard to control variables, the present study controlled for factors relating to the three dimensions (role ambiguity, conflict, and overload) of work stress (Beehr et al., 1976, Rizzo et al., 1970) and gender.",

First, we \u201cpurified\u201d the measurement model by eliminating variables that were not well fit by an initial confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) model. Using an assessment of item path coefficients, residual terms, and the overall Cronbach's alpha values for the scales, we removed six items and retained 44 items in the remainder of the analysis (see Table 1\nfor a list of retained items and factor loadings). Second, following recommendations by Anderson and Gerbing (1988), we examined the structural model for acceptable goodness-of-fit. Measures in the model reflected the intended underlying constructs and the model fit the data well (\u03c72 (857) = 1627.05, p < 0.01, RMSEA = 0.05, SRMR = 0.06, CFI = 0.90). Table 2\nreports descriptive statistics, intercorrelations, and the reliability and validity measures of the constructs, including the scale reliabilities, average variance extracted (AVE), and the range of shared variances (\u03a62). All of the items have significant loadings (p < 0.01) on their intended constructs, suggesting convergence of the indicators with the appropriate underlying factors (Anderson & Gerbing, 1988). The standardized factor loadings range from 0.63 to 0.91, and the factor correlations range from 0.05 to 0.72. The measures for the constructs displayed convergent and discriminant validity, with the reliability coefficients (\u03b1) of the measures above the 0.70 level suggested by Nunnally (1978), ranging from 0.70 to 0.92, and AVE values larger than the shared variance (\u03a62) between the constructs (Fornell & Larcker, 1981).

The present research also provides a useful extension for advancing JD-R theory by introducing the notion that personal demands (in addition to personal resources) can be utilized via the theory, as extended with respect to COR theory in a work setting. While COR is similar, the extension of JD-R to include the influence of personal demands that substitute for work demands offers a timely contribution, reflective of the modern sales workplace. Overall, we establish that personal wellbeing within the workplace is impacted by individual personal stressors that place demands on, and produce undesired states in, salespeople.",

This is an important topic because serious and debilitating health concerns can exceed one\u2019s ability to cope with demands that normally can be overcome (de Frias & Whyne, 2015). In a sales environment, the additional burden of health stress can have serious implications as salespeople are already heavily taxed by salient and incessant work demands related to their commission-based jobs given role expectations. Our findings specific to health stress in sales contribute to the literature in two primary ways. First, we find that health stress increases emotional exhaustion and escalates feelings of diminished personal accomplishment, the gradual diminishing of a salesperson\u2019s sense of importance and value to internal and external stakeholders, and a weakening confidence in their competency and ability to excel. Second, we find that health stress increases a salesperson\u2019s indifference or calloused disposition toward clients/customers, coworkers, and/or managers. These findings suggest that health stressors play an important role in the formation of burnout and provide initial results that address the lack of literature on the topic.",

Our findings show that when personal, non-work relationships undergo strains, the resulting stress increases emotional exhaustion in the workplace, which affects salesperson performance. Relationship stress also increases perceptions of diminished personal accomplishment, as failure in a personal relationship contributes to development of a belief that the salesperson is making a reduced contribution, or is not satisfying the demands of his/her co-workers and supervisors. Moreover, relationship stress increases a salesperson\u2019s indifference or calloused disposition toward clients/customers, coworkers, and/or managers.

For this type of stress, the salesperson feels overwhelmed by personal finance problems, which conflicts with having the sufficient resources to meet and provide for one\u2019s obligations (a basic need, see Maslow, 1943) resulting in emotional exhaustion. The demands from financial stress also contribute to an indifferent and calloused temperament toward clients, coworkers, and/or managers. These stakeholders may be viewed as part of the problem or impeding the solution, because they increase the demands on the salespersons\u2019 resources (i.e., time). Finally, though our findings show a significant increase in emotional exhaustion and depersonalization, the results do not show a significant relationship between financial stress and diminished personal accomplishment. Thus, it is possible that within a sales setting, salespeople may feel more in control of working their way out of a financial problem, because salespeople typically work in commission-based pay roles. Therefore, the salesperson may believe s/he is working even harder during financial strain, doing everything possible to satisfy expectations.",

Using a model that evaluates both the antecedents and outcomes of all three burnout dimensions, we offer further evidence of the negative impact burnout has on sales performance. These findings should encourage researchers to utilize the three-dimensional conceptualization of burnout in future research, as we demonstrate that they do not all move in lock step together. Thus, study of salesperson burnout as a multi-dimensional construct has merit in sales research and provides more granular and targeted findings.",

Given the prevalence of job-related and personal-related stressors and the undesirable relationship between personal stress and salesperson burnout, an important question arises: What can organizations do to reduce salesperson stress at home? This is an important question because if left unchecked, the symptoms of stress, which include insomnia (experienced by 41% of those with chronic stress), irritability (37%), being nervous (35%), having a lack of interest and motivation (34%), depression (32%), fatigue (32%), and feeling overwhelmed (32%) will continue damaging firm results (APA, 2015).",

Making this situation worse, stress tends to compound upon itself, to make it difficult for salespeople to recover from the effects of personal stress as it affects and builds upon negative outcomes.

Managers may want to consider incorporating programs that endeavor to help salespeople in coping with their stress and establishing boundaries that help them manage their personal health, relationships, and finances in positive ways. First, organizations can take steps to improve personal health by providing affordable and comprehensive healthcare plans, gym memberships and wellness incentives to exercise, and encourage healthy diets. Comprehensive health care that encourages preventive care can help prevent new health problems. Providing gym memberships, exercise time at work, and incentives for exercising outside of work can also assist employees in making healthier lifestyle choices. For large organizations with on-site cafeterias, subsidizing healthy food options to make them more attractive can aid in improving eating habits.

Helping employees to be more money-savvy can have a measurable return on investment.

On average, during the 13-week course each class payed off approximately $10,000 in debt and each individual saved $1,000 in an emergency fund (Sammer, 2012). The results also included fewer requests for pay advances and 401(k) plan loans, greater participation/contribution to 401(k) plans, and a decrease in financial stress.

For example, frequent requests to miss partial or full workdays to make trips to medical clinics should precede a conversation about the employee\u2019s larger needs, which may consist of a temporarily reduced workload. Second, managers should be able to identify employees who are uncharacteristically more irritable or have mentioned frequent relationship conflict and offer solutions such as individual or couple\u2019s counseling, flex time, or other assistance. Third, managers should be alert to requests for an advance in pay or a loan from an employer, borrowing from a retirement account and/or discontinuing contributions, frequent calls from lenders to verify employment and wages, and other financial red flags. In all of these circumstances, managers must be trained to delicately handle each situation, and know when to intervene, what solution to provide, and when to reduce the salesperson\u2019s workload.
