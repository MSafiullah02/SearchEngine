This study aimed to investigate associations between DPP-4 inhibitors and risk of autoimmune disorders in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Taiwan. Methods This retrospective cohort study used the nationwide data from the diabetes subsection of Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2013. Cox proportional hazards models were developed to compare the risk of autoimmune disorders and the subgroup analyses between the DPP-4i and DPP-4i-na\u00efve groups. Results A total of 774,198 type 2 diabetic patients were identified. The adjusted HR of the incidence for composite autoimmune disorders in DPP-4i group was 0.56 (95% CI 0.53-0.60; P < 0.001). The subgroup analysis demonstrated that the younger patients (aged 20-40 years: HR 0.47, 95% CI 0.35-0.61; aged 41-60 years: HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.46-0.55; aged 61-80 years: HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.58-0.68, P = 0.0004) and the lesser duration of diabetes diagnosed (0-5 years: HR 0.48, 95% CI 0.44-0.52; 6-10 years: HR 0.48, 95% CI 0.43-0.53; \u2267 10 years: HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.78-0.96, P < 0.0001), the more significant the inverse association of DPP-4 inhibitors with the incidence of composite autoimmune diseases. Conclusions DPP-4 inhibitors are associated with lower risk of autoimmune disorders in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients in Taiwan, especially for the younger patients and the lesser duration of diabetes diagnosed. The significant difference was found between the four types of DPP-4 inhibitors and the risk of autoimmune diseases. This study provides clinicians with useful information regarding the use of DPP-4 inhibitors for treating diabetic patients.",

DPP-4i has blood glucose-lowering effects by increasing glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). They are second-line oral anti-hyperglycemic drugs listed by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) just after metformin [1, 2] . Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), also known as CD26, a transmembrane type II glycoprotein belonging to the prolyl oligopeptidase family, is expressed in various cell types, including fibroblasts, endothelial cells, epithelial cells, macrophages and T lymphocytes [3] . Since DPP-4 has wide distribution, it is involved in a great number of physiological processes. Evidence has shown that DPP-4 plays a role in chemotaxis, signal transduction, T cell-mediated immune responses and lymphokine synthesis [4] [5] [6] . Hence, apart from its role in glucose homeostasis, CD26/DPP-4 expression may be associated with various pathogenic conditions such as Managed by Massimo Porta.",

Several groups have investigated altered DPP-4 activity in autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [4, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] , systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) [14] , psoriasis [15] , inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [16] and multiple sclerosis [17] . Many studies discovered decreased expression of both CD26 and levels of DPP-4 activity in subjects with RA, a systemic inflammatory disease involving joint destruction. Animal models demonstrated increased severity of RA resulting from lower DPP-4 activity in the synovial fluid of CD26 knockout mice [18, 19] . Several case reports demonstrated cases of DPP-4 inhibitor-induced synovitis [20] , RA or polyarthritis [21] [22] [23] . In addition, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also warned in 2015 that DPP-4i treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) may cause severe joint pain. Until now, while DPP-4 has several biological functions in proinflammatory pathways [24, 25] , the exact pathological pathways and influence of DPP-4 on the immune system, particularly autoimmune disorders, are not well known. Little has been studied about the relationships between DPP-4 inhibitors, RA and other autoimmune disorders and the possible mechanism behind these relationships.",

We extracted data from the diabetes subsection of the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) in Taiwan between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2013. Because Sitagliptin was the first marketed DPP-4i in Taiwan, which was started to extensively wide prescribed since 2009, we choose the time frame from 2009 to 2013 for cumulative analysis of occurrences of autoimmune diseases. We recruited patients age \u2265 20 years with ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes for T2DM (ICD-9-CM: 250. XX) [28, 29] . We further divided participants into a DPP-4i group and a control (DPP-4i-na\u00efve) group. The DPP-4i group was defined as patients receiving any prescription of DPP-4i during the cohort period. DPP-4i drugs of interest included four types: sitagliptin, vildagliptin, saxagliptin and linagliptin. The index date of the DPP-4i group was defined as the earliest date of DPP-4i prescription. The index date of the DPP-4i-na\u00efve group is the date randomly assigned by duration from the day of DM diagnosis to the DPP-4i prescription date of the DPP-4i group. Conducting this matching of prescription time-distribution allowed us to avoid the imbalance of prescription times between the two groups, which can lead to survival bias. The exclusion criteria were as follows: type 1 DM, age younger than 20 years or older than 80 years, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or malignancy diagnosed before enrollment, and those who had used incretin-based drugs before the index date (Supplementary Figure) . The participants aged older than 80 years were considered the immunocompromised population; hence, they were excluded to reduce the possibility to alter the outcomes. The study cohort was followed continuously until December 31, 2013.",

Later in 2018, Prof. Fan also found the high susceptibility of infection by MERS-CoV in the transgene mouse model of global over-expression of human dipeptidyl peptidase-4 [33] . Taken together, these evidences showed that human DPP-4 (CD26) acted as key transmembrane glycoprotein that potentially mediated infection and inflammation. In addition, DPP-4i was generally considered to decrease chemotaxis, T cell immunity and lymphokines, which may act as the potential mechanism to reduce the incidence of autoimmune diseases. The above evidences were consistently correspondent with our findings that DPP-4 inhibitors users were correlated with the decreased incidence of autoimmune diseases as well as a decreased infection rate compared with non-DPP-4 inhibitors users in type 2 diabetic patients in our nationwide population-based cohort study. Furthermore, human DPP-4 contains nine potential N-glycosylation sites, and the dynamic process of N-terminal sialylation appears to play an important role in the pathophysiology of autoimmune disease [8, 34] . Resting T cells were determined to be more sialylated than activated T cells. Hypersialylation has been associated with RA, SLE and aging. This might be one of the possible explanations of our subgroup analysis showing that patients who are younger and with shorter T2DM duration have more significant inverse association between DPP-4i and AD.",

In addition, another population-based study conducted by Kim et al. found that DPP-4 inhibitors may reduce the risk of RA and composite autoimmune disease [36] . Another population-based cohort study using Korean National Health Insurance Claims Database found that the risk of incident RA and composite AD was decreased for DPP4i initiators compared with non-DPP4i initiators, which was consistent with our findings [37] . Our cohort study, which had a follow-up period of 5 years between January 2009 and December 2013, is distinct because we included large Asian population (387,099 in DPP-4i group vs. 387,099 in DPP-4i-naive group).

Although we included a wide range of variables such as comorbidities and non-studied medications using the claims data from 12 months prior to the index date to balance the two groups, a 12-month period may not be long enough to detect all baseline information of the potential confounders associated with autoimmune disease. Second, the severity of T2DM could not be evaluated properly because no biochemistry data were available. Nevertheless, we matched the T2DM diagnosis duration and glucose-lowering medications between the two groups, finding that the T2DM severity is relatively equal between the groups. Third, we relied on diagnosis codes without available images, laboratory data or disease-specific immunomodulating medications prescriptions for the outcomes. In order to strengthen ascertainment, we also identified catastrophic illness certification for each outcome. Nevertheless, several autoimmune diseases such as autoimmune thyroiditis were not fit for catastrophic illness certificate in Taiwan, which was absolutely definite in differentiation of etiology of each diagnosis of rare diseases. Therefore, it is difficult to differentiate the etiology of autoimmune thyroid disease solely from the ICD-9-CM codes recorded in the NHI research database in spite of the confirmation by laboratory results of thyroid-related autoantibody in the current study designs.",
