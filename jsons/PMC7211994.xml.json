Will the COVID-19 pandemic peaking in the spring further exacerbate seasonal (spring) mania and suicidality?(b)Will a pandemic like COVID-19 trigger psychiatric illnesses in people who so far have been considered mentally healthy? Or in other words, can it lead to an increase in psychiatric morbidity and comorbidity in the general population?(c)How can psychiatrists and other mental healthcare professionals meaningfully address the potential impact on mental health of the population? In particular, how can a discipline that is based on a very close doctor\u2013patient relationship uphold its standards of authenticity and empathy when both doctors and patients are considered a potential source of infection?(d)In our new world of social isolation, patients in need of care, even urgent care, are cancelling necessary appointments. How do we make telepsychiatry as meaningful, efficient and as effective as possible? Further, will such isolation lead to future psychiatric symptoms?(e)How can the mental health ramifications of the COVID-19 pandemic be communicated to other, non-psychiatrically trained health professionals? This also includes the impact on first responders (police, paramedics etc) and health professionals (emergency room and intensive care unit staff) working on the frontline of the fight against COVID-19.(f)How can we avoid and fight stigma and aggression and discrimination directed at people infected or presumed to be affected by COVID-19?(g)Are liaison psychiatrists, who frequently are requested to consult prior to neurologists, cognizant and prepared to address atypical neurological and neuropsychiatric presentations associated with COVID-19? Integrated care is recommended among healthcare providers.(h)As healthcare systems focus on the direct medical effects of COVID-19 with reallocation of resources including personnel, there may be a negative impact on both the quantity and quality of mental healthcare. This has long-term effects for psychiatric and general populations, for healthcare providers and first responders, as disasters, high-mortality infectious outbreaks and this pandemic in particular will lead to significant levels of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), especially if a period of quarantine is required.1,2 The current medical morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19 must be dramatically addressed, but so too should the acute and chronic morbidity and even mortality from the development and/or worsening of PTSD and other psychiatric diagnoses.",

What is needed goes beyond research; \u2018hands-on\u2019 psychiatric and mental healthcare clinical interventions are needed.
