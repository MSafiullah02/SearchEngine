            "text": "DO may lead to increased contamination rates by 2 mechanisms. First, DOs in the OR are linked to the number of staff in the OR during operations [16]. Second, DOs create turbulence between 2 spaces, and disrupt the positive laminar flow of the OR, which might subsequently lead to faster spread of airborne bacteria and particles to the surgical field [1], [13], [17], [18]. Andersson et al [14] showed a positive correlation between traffic flow rates and air bacterial counts in orthopedic procedures. They also identified a direct correlation between the number of people present in the OR and bacterial counts. Quraishi et al [19] demonstrated a direct correlation between the activity level of OR personnel and bacterial fallout into the sterile field. Additionally, Lynch et al [20] showed an exponential relationship between the number of DOs and the number of personnel in the OR. In their series, an information request was the main reason for the majority of DOs.",

The highest percentage of DOs occurs during the preincision [18] or postincision periods [10]. The majority of the traffic constitutes the circulating nurses, followed by surgical implant representatives, and then the anesthesia and orthopedic staff [18], [20], [21]. The most frequently reported single reason for DOs is getting supplies, along with gathering and transferring information. Scrubbing in and out during the procedure, staff rotation for breaks, talking with colleagues in the corridor, and coordinating with nursing and anesthesia personnel were also reported as reasons for DOs [18], [21]. It is important to note that the rate of unjustified traffic was considerably high among different studies [8], [18].",

The loss of positive OR pressure was a transient phenomenon; however, the time needed for the recovery of pressurization was unknown. On the contrary, Weiser et al [4] reported that positive pressure was not defeated during any single DO; however, they found that contaminated outside air entered the OR if 2 doors were simultaneously opened. In their study, OR pressure recovery took approximately 15 seconds following a DO. They supported that OR contamination was more likely attributable to the effects of the personnel who enter the OR, rather than as a primary cause of DOs. Furthermore, Rezapoor et al [25] demonstrated that the laminar airflow was protective against the negative influences of the number of people, and partially of DOs. Smith et al [13] also showed that bacteria colony forming units cultured on plates placed in sterile basins in the OR during the operation were significantly negatively associated with any DOs, and the function of laminar air flow.",

However, very little is known on the risks of potentially increased surgical site infections (SSIs)/periprosthetic joint infections (PJIs) when the surgeon performing the arthroplasty has an upper respiratory infection. On the other hand, Navalkele et al [33] demonstrated that SSIs were more likely to develop in patients who had respiratory tract infections within 30 days prior to surgery (20% vs 6.6%; odds ratio 3.42, 95% confidence interval 1.62-7.22, P = .0034).",

If the principal pathogens responsible for common cold, rhinitis, and influenza (rhinovirus, coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus) are generally not responsible for SSIs, other microorganisms are commonly associated with a viral respiratory disease: Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Gram-negative bacteria, and methicillin-resistant S aureus (measuring 0.2-5 \u03bcm) can adhere to the condensation droplets to form colony forming units, and be infectious in short-range scenarios (less than 1 m), theoretically leading to SSIs.

They measured the number of particulates being 0.5 and 1.0 \u03bcm in size, and found that there were significantly higher numbers of airborne particulates when disposable bouffant hats were used compared to cloth surgical caps (P < .05). There was no significant difference seen in airborne particulates after active sampling, when comparing bouffant hats with disposable surgical hats. However, for passive settle plate analysis, it was determined that bouffant style hats allowed for a significantly greater amount of microbial shedding at the sterile field, compared to disposable skull caps (P < .05). They further concluded that disposable bouffant hats had a higher permeability/porosity, and yielded higher levels of bacterial shedding in the OR. They endorsed the use of skull caps for reducing the potential risk of contamination from scalp hair. This, however, is against the recommendation of the Association of Peri-Operative Registered Nurses for OR personnel to wear bouffant caps.

However, the use of proper ventilation techniques drastically reduced these counts, and the authors concluded that nonscrubbed individuals did not need to wear headgear because proper ventilation likely counteracted any bacterial shedding [53]. Ten years later, however, a conflicting study by Friberg et al [54] demonstrated a 2- to 5-fold increase in bacterial contamination at random sites throughout the OR when headgear was not worn, and a 60-fold increase in contamination in the wound bed. Considering these results, it is apparent that wearing headgear markedly decreases the probability of spreading fomites and debris to an open surgical wound.

A prospective crossover study performed by Hee et al [75] examined fabric samples from the scrubs of 16 anesthesiologists divided into 3 cohorts that had worn their scrubs in different environments (group 1: OR only; group 2: OR and hospital wards; group 3: OR, hospital wards, and outpatient offices) in an effort to determine the level of contamination to attire as a result of different environmental factors. Fabric samples were collected for microbiological analysis from the chest, waist, and hip of each anesthetist over the course of an 8-hour work day every 150 minutes. The group determined there to be no significant differences in the bacterial colony counts among the 3 cohorts in comparing the bacterial colony forming units (CFUs) [P = .669 for group 1: 16.8 CFU vs group 2: 15.3 CFU; P = .942 for group 1: 16.8 CFU (95% confidence interval, CI 9.8-23.8) vs group 3: 17.1 CFU (95% CI 10.1-24.1); and P = .616 for group 2: 15.3 CFU (95% CI 8.3-22.3) vs group 3: 17.1 CFU (95% CI 10.1-24.1] [75]. Additionally, a study by Sivanandan et al [76] examined the level of garment contamination by comparing blood agar plates pressed against the OR attire of 20 physicians (at 2-hour intervals during an 8-hour period) who had worn scrubs inside and outside OR attire designated areas. Their results also suggested that the levels of contamination were comparable between the groups that wore OR attire within restrictive OR attire settings and those that wore OR attire outside these settings [76].",

In total, 150 samples were collected during the project, 50 from each study arm. The 3 groups were composed of the following: group 1: scrubs worn in designated areas and a protective covering was worn when outside these zones and they never left the hospital; group 2: scrubs worn in designated areas and outside without protective covering and they never left the hospital; and group 3: scrubs worn inside/outside designated areas without protective covering and they were allowed to go outside the hospital.

By introducing these precautionary measures, the SSI rates dropped from 5.9% to 3.0%, the MRSA infection rates from 1.2% to 0.3%, and the MRSA PJI rates from 9.7% to 1.0%. Mullen et al [89] implemented a decolonization protocol of colonized staff and patients and reported a decreased rate of SSIs from 1.76% to 0.33%. Despite reporting the highest staff colonization rates (31% of theater staff), Portigliatti Barbos et al [94] showed a reduction of the already low SSI rates of 0.6% to 0% after a 5-day decolonization course of intranasal mupirocin ointment for affected orthopedic surgical team members. Dilogo et al [91] did not identify any MRSA colonized orthopedic staff members, and concluded that there were no significant associations between MRSA staff colonization and infections. We did not identify a relevant study investigating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis within the context of the question.",
