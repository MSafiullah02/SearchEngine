Australia is relatively unique amongst developed industrialised nations: it is comparatively sparsely populated, with the majority of the population concentrated around the southern and eastern seaboard. The total Australian population is approximately 20.2 million,1 predominantly urban and the majority descended from the European migration in the last 200 years. Indigenous Australians (Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders) have inhabited the continent for at least 4000 years and comprise \u223c2.5% of the total population.1 The majority of Indigenous Australians live in deprived socio-economic circumstances, often in remote rural locations. Indigenous Australians have some of the worst health indicators in the industrialised world.2 They bear a disproportionate burden of infectious diseases in childhood \u2013 and pneumonia is no exception.",

In this cohort of 270068 singleton live births (17366 Indigenous births, 252702 non-Indigenous births), pneumonia accounted for 4518 hospital admissions, equivalent to 5.8% of all admissions with an infectious diagnosis. Almost half of admissions with pneumonia in the first two years of life were in Indigenous children, in whom pneumonia accounted for 12.2% of all infectious diagnoses. Not only was pneumonia far more common in Indigenous children (Fig. 1\n), these children were three times more likely than non-Indigenous children to have multiple admissions with this diagnosis. Indigenous children with pneumonia also had a longer hospital stay than non-Indigenous children, possibly reflecting more severe disease and logistic difficulties with returning families to their remote locations.",

In Australia, the majority of data relates to pneumococcal pneumonia with bacteraemia in children from the National enhanced invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) surveillance program.18 The incidence of bacteraemic pneumococcal pneumonia (BPP) in children under 5 years of age in 2001 prior to the widespread introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) was 17.4 per 100000 population, representing 37% of cases of IPD in this age group.18 The proportion of IPD associated with pneumonia in Indigenous children was much higher (72%) compared to non-indigenous children (31%). The overall incidence of BPP in Indigenous children was approximately 15-fold higher than in non-indigenous children under 5 years of age. The serotypes responsible for IPD were more varied in Indigenous children, with approximately 55% being due to the seven serotypes in the licensed pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Prevnar\u2122) compared to 86% in non-Indigenous children under 2 years of age. BPP figures clearly underestimate the true burden of pneumococcal pneumonia. In undertaking a cost-effectiveness analysis of PCV in Australian children, Butler and colleagues estimated the incidence of moderate or severe pneumococcal pneumonia to be 100 per 100000 persons in children under 5 years.19 Vaccine efficacy studies also provide an estimate of the burden of disease. In the PCV efficacy study in northern California, the incidence of chest X-ray proven pneumonia was reduced by 17.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 4.8\u201328.9%) in the intention to treat analysis20 and a similar level of efficacy was seen in a study of 9-valent PCV in South Africa (25% in HIV negative children).21 The impact of universal PCV in both Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australian children is awaited with interest.",

Hib pneumonia represented 4\u20138% of invasive Hib disease in non-Indigenous children in southeastern Australia22, 23 but up to 40% of invasive Hib disease in Indigenous children from the Northern Territory.24 The age of onset of bacteraemic pneumonia was much earlier in Indigenous children (majority <12 months of age). The epidemiology of bacteraemic Hib pneumonia in Indigenous children is similar to that in developing countries25 suggesting that Hib was responsible for approximately 20% of severe pneumonia in Indigenous children prior to Hib vaccination. Following the introduction of conjugate Hib vaccines, the incidence of bacteraemic Hib pneumonia has dramatically decreased in both populations.26\n",

In a study of 12\u201314 year-old Sydney children, 2% of the Australian-born and 27% of the overseas-born children had a positive Mantoux test.38 The risk of developing TB disease following latent infection may be extremely high in early childhood39 and remains significant through later childhood and adulthood.40 Active identification of latent TB in recent migrants to Australia, especially in children, although not universally performed, would seem prudent.39, 41\n",

In tropical Australia, unusual pathogens are encountered and there is the additional risk posed by imported respiratory infections from neighbouring countries. Indigenous Australians bear a hugely disproportionate burden of many diseases and have a much higher incidence of pneumonia compared to non-Indigenous children. The introduction of conjugate Hib vaccines decreased the burden of Hib pneumonia in both Indigenous and non-Indigenous children highlighting the importance of vaccination in reducing the burden of pneumonia.",
