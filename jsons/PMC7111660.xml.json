It was earliest discovered in leguminous plants, therefore it was named legume lectin (or L-type lectin). Thereafter, many other members of lectins have been identified in most kinds of organisms, such as fungi, animals and plants. L-type lectins (LTLs) possess a luminal carbohydrate recognition domain which can bind to saccharides. In vertebrates, four kinds of LTLs have been reported, namely endoplasmic reticulum Golgi intermediate compartment-53 (ERGIC-53), ERGIC-53 like protein (ERGL), 36 kDa vesicular integral membrane protein (VIP36), and VIP36 like protein (VIPL) [1]. However, only ERGIC-53 and VIP36 were identified in invertebrates [2].",

WSSV has caused great economic loss in shrimp aquaculture industry worldwide. Up to date, there is lack of effective strategies against WSSV infection. The studies of WSSV replication and host-interactions would help to explore effective strategies for WSSV prevention and control. There is growing evidence that ERGIC-53 is closely related with virus infection. ERGIC-53 is required for the production of infectious arenavirus, coronavirus, and filovirus particles [11]. In the present study, a LTL (named PcL-lectin) was identified from red swamp crayfish, Procambarus clarkii. Gene sequencing and phylogenetic tree analysis results showed that the PcL-lectin was a member of ERGIC-53. The expression level of PcL-lectin was significantly down regulated in crayfish after challenged with white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). The anti-viral properties of the PcL-lectin were further investigated by using recombinant PcL-lectin protein as well as RNA interference (RNAi). Viral proteins which might interact with the PcL-lectin were also studied. The results suggest that PcL-lectin may play an important role in response to WSSV infection in red swamp crayfish.",

            "text": "There is growing evidence that the members of lectin family have been involved in virus infection. LdlrLec1 and LdlrLec1 interacted with VP28, and inhibited the infection and replication of WSSV in M. japonicus\n[24]. MjsvCL, DC-SIGN and L-SIGN were served as receptor candidates in the infection of WSSV or influenza A virus [25], [26]. Lavvy, a kind of CTLs, was response to WSSV infection in Litopenaeus vannamei. MjsvCL together with calreticulin, was identified as a receptor in the infection of WSSV in M. japonicus\n[25]. However, all these lectins identified from shrimps are all C-type lectins. It has been reported that ERGIC-53 was related with the replication of some RNA viruses, such as arenavirus, coronavirus, and filovirus [11]. To better understand the function of PcL-lectin in crayfish during WSSV infection, recombinant PcL-lectin was further used for the studies. The results showed that recombinant PcL-lectin was able to enhance the multiplication of WSSV in crayfish (Fig. 5) and it could rescues the multiplication of WSSV in the crayfish which their endogenous PcL-lectin was knocked down by RNAi (Fig. 6), suggesting that PcL-lectin may play a role in the multiplication of WSSV. The PcL-lectin was down regulated in crayfish infected with WSSV at the early stage (Fig. 3), and recombinant PcL-lectin protein could facilitate WSSV replication (Fig. 5). The mortality of the crayfish was enhanced 2 d post of the challenge with WSSV [13]. It suggested that WSSV may utilize the PcL-lectin which stored in cell at the early stage of infection. On the other hand, crayfish may also resist WSSV infection by down regulated the expression of PcL-lectin. The reduction of PcL-lectin could not completely suppress the replication of WSSV.",
