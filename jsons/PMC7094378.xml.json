            "text": "The recent Ebola virus epidemic in Western Africa revealed how quickly an outbreak may gain momentum in a new environment. The Ebola virus disease (EVD), caused by Ebola virus (EBOV; formerly Zaire ebolavirus), was not known among the people of West Africa. This contrasts with communities in tropical regions of sub-Saharan Africa where EVD is endemic [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. It is even possible that the virus has been circulating in West Africa all along without causing outbreaks [6]. Consequently, the epidemic raged seemingly unrestrained over several countries. When the healthcare infrastructure collapsed, there were even fears of a pandemic [1], [7], although some models assessed the risk of EVD spreading outside of Africa as small [8].",

Beyond the recommendations that have been issued for future practice, we believe there is also a profound insight into epidemics available from the general principles. Namely, the course of an epidemic, its outbreak and decay follow the same sigmoid pattern as any other natural process [13] (Fig. 1\n). Therefore, it is not only about refining mathematical epidemiology further, but the epidemic itself can be understood, like any other process, as a manifestation of natural law.",

This comprehension about what ultimately drives the epidemic, in turn, helps to intervene in its efficient causes. These are diverse mechanisms that facilitate or impede the spread of the infectious agent. Obviously, the thermodynamic account is overlaid with changes in material forms, e.g., in human physiology due to the infection as well as in social behavior due to the epidemic. In this holistic manner, we communicate comprehension about epidemics from the molecular to the societal level. Our scale-free theoretical perspective is consistent, as it should be, with practical understanding. Namely, when fighting off epidemics, engagement all levels is vital [14].",

First and foremost, the infectious agent must be identified, and its means of spreading must be recognized [7], [15], [16]. In physics, a cause is a force, i.e., an energy difference. Its consumption powers consequential changes in motion. Here these effects are the infection, its spreading including all the societal consequences. This naturalistic stance is, of course, common sense. The size of an epidemic relates ultimately to the free energy that the epidemic can consume. Potential carriers embody the free energy. The susceptible population, on the other hand, depends on the mechanisms that the epidemic can exploit and deploy when spreading. When the infectious agent is prevented from accessing further resources of free energy bound to the healthy population, the spread of the disease will invariably decline.",

Still, we acknowledge that deterministic equations, such as the logistic equation, are well founded. In many cases, they are excellent approximations of the courses of epidemics. In contrast to common belief, we maintain that the ultimate inability to make accurate predictions does not stem from some unknown or imprecisely known factors [13], [17]. This ignorance does prevent making accurate predictions [7], [15], [18], but we argue that the ambiguity in predictions follows from the inherent non-determinism of natural processes. Many mathematical models are augmented with stochastic factors to account for indeterminacy or uncertainty [19], [20], [21], [22]. However, nothing will happen without some force, i.e. a cause. Also, chaos theory postulates deterministic equations that will inflate minor differences in initial conditions to major dissimilarities in final states [9], [23], [24], [25]. Of course, a seemingly sporadic encounter may trigger an epidemic. Still, without the susceptible population, there would be no outbreak at all. Similarly, we argue that the flapping of the wings of a distant butterfly will not dictate the course of a tornado several weeks earlier, but all states along the course contribute to the outcome.",

The non-determinate paths follow from the fact that causes and effects, i.e., the forces and changes in motions cannot be separated from each other. Mathematically speaking, since the variables cannot be separated, the equation of motion cannot be solved.

The rate of infection depends on the spreading of infection which in turn will affect the rate and so on. In other words, circumstances for the spreading will change along with the spreading. Therefore, any epidemic will gain momentum when accessing new means of spreading. Likewise, the rate of infection will be slowed down when the infectious agent is recognized and appropriate measures are taken, which, in turn, will improve conditions to limit the spread of the epidemic further [11], [19], [20], [22]. By the same token, this interdependence manifests itself so that when the society begins to recover from the calamity. Then it will become easier to take even more effective measures, and so on [9]. All in all, non-determinism neither follows from the complexity of the phenomenon nor from the lack of knowledge in initial conditions, but from interdependency among the causes and effects.",

For example, a new infectious agent may emerge from a mutation at the molecular level. Customarily, emergence is thought to reside beyond physics that, as a discipline, is geared to reducing systems to their constituents. However, the thermodynamic theory [13], [17], adopted here, is based on statistical mechanics of open systems. Its equations include also flows of energy to the system from its surroundings and vice versa. Most notably photons that couple to changes of state, i.e., reactions, are essential ingredients in addition to the systemic constituents. Thus, emergence is an integral part of the theory [30].",

In fact, the various deterministic and stochastic equations are oftentimes the best options there is. Data is limited and imprecise, to begin with. Also, the data are invariably biased by disparate channels that are available for flows of information [7], [8], [12], [15], [31]. This bias can also be seen in Fig 1, Fig 2, Fig 3\n, which highlight the difference between two data sources, namely the WHO Situation reports and Patient databases, both collected by WHO, but through different routes. Although the numbers differ, the general form of the series of events remains the same. Precise data is invariably hard to collect. In dire conditions, where the whole infrastructure of the affected society is crumbling, the problem is manifold [11], [32]. There is also the possibility of unexpected variables. The emergent factors include, e.g., a mutated virus or cultural and geographical differences between different outbreak instances [3], [5], [7], [9], [12], [15], [17], [33], [34]. For these reasons alone even the most sophisticated simulations will fail to predict epidemics.

The notion of probability gives the answer to the question \u201cwhat it takes to get infected?\u201d, using the general terms of physics. Obviously, it entails at least encountering the agent, which itself depends on many things. The formalism of thermodynamic theory considers all these things. For example, all the evidence points to the EVD epidemic being introduced in Sierra Leone by a group of 12 people who attended the same funeral ceremony of a local healer in Guinea [4]. In Guinea, the beginning of the epidemic has been traced to the probable first case in 2013 [3]. Clearly, it would be, in practice, an indecipherable jigsaw to predict the individual courses that culminated in the infection, but formally they all can be denoted mathematically to maintain consistency with causality. Likewise, numerous factors are involved before the agent once contacted succeeds in bypassing the body's defense mechanisms. Still, that can all be presented formally.",

Increasing victims attracted ever more of the susceptible to come together. This mode of behavior changed the model from the density-parametrized to a frequency-based one, excluding control measures that were introduced later. Thus, it is not obvious from the outset which is the appropriate model to cope with an infectious disease. While the general thermodynamic formalism contains all modes of infection and spreading, it does not, as such, specify, without further information, which terms of free energy are the largest. These are the most important factors to be recognized in each case at a given phase.",

Some others can be described by the virus\u2019 ability to benefit from the social and cultural aspects of the host population, e.g. burial rituals, social patterns, and infrastructure. All these factors are according to the thermodynamic tenet merely epidemic's mechanisms to consume free energy in the least time. These mechanisms have emerged and evolved just as any other mechanism to increase consumption. Differences are only quantitative. For instance, in small viral genomes, there is less room to create a balance between adaptability and adaptation than in many other systems [54]. We reason that also the spectrum of infections from contagious to latent is a mere manifestation of the overall least-time free energy consumption by various viruses. Thus, it is not an analogy, but an identity, to regard epidemic outbreaks on the one hand as due to social unrest or to economic upheaval and on the other hand to chemical oscillations and bifurcations. They all are natural processes manifesting the least-time free energy consumption.",

Likewise, it is worth recognizing that nature is neither deterministic nor stochastic, but non-deterministic because everything depends on everything else.

The transformations, i.e., the spreading of infection, will change the potential energy bound in the population, ultimately in the matter. The vertical wavy arrows denote concurrent changes in dissipation such energy in the form of heat and light. The vertical bow arrows mean the exchange of indistinguishable entities without changes in energy. The system evolves, step-by-step, via absorptive or emissive jk-transformations that are mediated or catalyzed by entities in the population themselves, such as healthcare procedures and cultural habits, toward a more probable partition of populations. The system eventually arrives at a stationary-state balance where the levels are populated so that the average energy kBT equals that in the system's surroundings. A sufficiently statistical system will evolve gradually because a single step of absorption or emission is a small perturbation of the average energy.
