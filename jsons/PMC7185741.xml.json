In ancient times, the Athenian plague of 430\u2013427 BC reportedly killed up to one-half of the population of Athens, the Justinian plague of 541\u2013542 AD resulted in more than 100 million deaths, and the Black Death between 1348 and 1350 accounted for more than 100 million deaths. Worldwide, changes in socioeconomic, demographic and environmental factors have led to the resurgence of old and new infectious diseases. Over the past few decades, the world has witnessed not only the increasing problem of drug-resistant pathogens in diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis but also the emergence of new pathogens. These include the rotavirus in 1973, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in 1981, hepatitis C virus in 1989, hantavirus in 1993 and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002. The re-emergence of epidemic chikungunya virus (CHIKV), previously known to be a benign disease, in Africa, the Indian Ocean, South-East Asia and the Pacific in the past decade has caused severe morbidity with some fatalities. More recently, in April 2009, the triple reassortant influenza A (H1N1) viruses, which contain genes from human, swine and avian influenza A viruses, appeared and have spread to more than 212 countries and overseas territories or communities, causing more than 15,921 deaths over the course of one year.",

            "text": "Several statistical measures are used frequently to quantify disease in populations and to facilitate disease management (Table 2\n). One such measure is the incidence of disease, defining the rate at which new cases occur in a population at risk during a specified time period. Because in reality the population at risk is constantly changing because of births, deaths and migrations, this measure might not be a good reflection of the true incidence of disease. One way to solve this is to relate the number of new cases to the person years at risk, which is computed by summing the time during which each individual member of the population is at risk during the measurement period. Another commonly used measure is the prevalence of disease, which is the proportion of the infected in a population at a given point of time. This is often used as an alternative to incidence in cases in which the sample size is small. For diseases with high mortality rates, researchers will be interested in calculating the case fatality rate (CFR) [9]. This is the proportion of infected patients dying from a certain disease during a specified period. For instance, an epidemiological investigation on 1425 patients with SARS-CoV infection in Hong Kong reported up to 28 April 2003 estimated that the CFR was 13.2% for patients younger than 60 years and 43.4% for patients aged 60 years or older [10]. It is used to link mortality to morbidity and can help to measure various aspects or properties of a disease, such as its pathogenicity, severity or virulence. Another important factor that researchers and clinicians are interested in is the clinical attack rate, which is the proportion of infected patients with symptoms of the disease [9]. It was estimated that the median clinical attack rate for the 1889 Russian flu pandemic was 60%, and the CFR ranged from 0.1% to 0.28% [9]. Other statistical measures exist and have been reviewed elsewhere [11].",

            "text": "Understanding how a disease is transmitted from one person to the next or spread in a population is important for assessing the risk of infection, for contact tracing and for building a contingency plan to contain the outbreak. Air travel can play an important part in the spread of infectious disease. The transmissions of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, SARS-CoV and influenza A virus within the confined space of airplane cabins have been well documented [12]. Computational analysis on inter-regional influenza spread in the USA from 1996 to 2005 has shown that international air travel might affect the onset of disease outbreak [13]. Cr\u00e9pey and Barth\u00e9lemy [14] have studied the epidemic patterns of seasonal influenza outbreaks in the USA from 1972 to 2002. The team concluded that air travel flow during this period of time was sufficient to propagate an epidemic throughout the USA and suggested that realistic modeling of the spread of epidemics at the interstate level might only need to take air transportation into account. Yet history has shown that air travel restrictions would have a limited, if any, effect on an outbreak. The 1889 Russian flu pandemic had spread across all of Europe and the USA within four months, despite slower surface travel and much smaller traveler flows. Mathematical modeling has now made it possible for us to compute the speed of disease transmission, as shown recently by Valleron et al. [9], which was estimated at the rate of 394 (\u00b1255) km/week in Europe and 1015 (\u00b1727) km/week in the USA. Several computer simulation experiments on the spread of pandemic influenza have also concluded that air travel restrictions would have limited impact compared with local control measures [15]. An explanation for this might be that the speed of a pandemic is not dependent on the passenger flows between cities but the degree of connectedness of a city network [15]. Attempts are also being made to analyze how a disease spreads within an urban environment [16], quantify the relative importance of different modes of transportation on the regional spread of influenza epidemics [15], and evaluate intervention strategies such as isolation, household quarantine, school or workplace closure, travel restrictions and mass screening at key control nodes including sea ports and airports 17, 18.",

            "text": "Similarity between related sequences can give clues to the structure, function or homology to the common ancestor [19]. Computational methods that can align sequence features, therefore, are particularly useful. Multiple sequence alignment methods organize the sequences of DNA, RNA or protein to identify regions of similarity that might help explain functional and/or phenotypic variability. The 2009 H1N1 flu was not the first human pandemic caused by influenza A viruses. It shares common ancestry with the 1889 Russian flu that killed approximately 1 million people, the 1918 Spanish flu that reportedly affected approximately 25% of the global population and killed at least 50 million people worldwide, the 1957 Asian flu that resulted in approximately 2 million deaths, and the 1968 Hong Kong flu that caused approximately 1 million deaths. In cases in which ancestry is unclear, multiple sequence alignment methods have been useful for inferring their phylogenetic relationships (Fig. 1\n). This includes not only identifying globally optimal alignment solutions for studying highly conserved sequences but also identifying maximally homologous subsequences among sets of long sequences for detecting distantly related proteins. By applying phylogenetic analysis to rapidly evolving viruses such as HIV, Bhattacharya et al.\n[20] have shown that viral escape effects instead of immune escape often explain apparent human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mediated immune-escape mutations defined by older analysis methods.",

There are also several attempts to identify amino acid residues that are likely to be involved in virus adaptation, for example, by finding interdependencies between mutations in multiple proteins. Miotto et al. [23] applied mutual information, an information theoretical statistic that measures the strength of association between a pair of variables, to identify characteristic sites in influenza A proteins where human isolates present conserved mutations. A catalogue of 68 characteristic sites in eight internal proteins was created from 92,343 sequences and used to derive adaptive signatures of influenza A proteomes.",

Typically, sequence analysis is performed on a collection of biological sequences that are assumed to share an evolutionary relationship. However, the flood of publicly available and newly generated pathogen sequences annotated with host organism, time of isolation and country of origin have opened up the possibility of incorporating these parameters in the study of microbial pathogen evolution. Sheng et al.\n[24] have recently shown how geographical and time information in public biological databases could be integrated with pattern-mining algorithms to study antigenic changes in influenza A viruses. The likelihood of one virus being able to mutate into another form is dependent on whether they exist within a certain time period, the connectivity between the locations where they were collected and their sequence similarity. The method was used to trace the evolution trajectory of H5N1, H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes in Asia, the USA and Europe at different time points. Attempts to unify the epidemiological and evolutionary processes that drive spatio-temporal incidence and phylogenetic patterns at different scales have also been reported. For instance, Grenfell et al.\n[25] introduced a phylodynamic framework to study how pathogen genetic variation \u2013 modulated by host immunity, transmission bottlenecks and epidemic dynamics \u2013 affects the diversity of epidemiological and phylogenetic patterns in measles, influenza A viruses, HIV, dengue and hepatitis C virus.",

One approach is to estimate natural selection for nucleotide usage at single amino acid sites 27, 28. Because of degeneracy of the genetic code, some point mutations are silent with no amino acid replacements. The neutral theory of molecular evolution, first introduced by Kimura in 1968 [29], states that most nucleotide substitutions are selectively neutral and are fixed by random genetic drift. Because synonymous (silent) substitutions are primarily transparent to natural selection, whereas non-synonymous (replacement) substitutions might be due to strong selective pressure, comparing the fixation rates between non-synonymous (d\nN) and synonymous (d\nS) substitutions can help to assess the extent of adaptive evolution at highly variable genetic loci [30].",

Using a \u2018relaxed-clock\u2019 phylogenetic model to estimate absolute rates of synonymous and non-synonymous substitution through time, Lemey et al. [32] showed that disease progression among patients is predicted by synonymous substitution rates, whereas non-synonymous rates evolve within patients as a consequence of changing antibody selective pressure. The hemagglutinin gene from the influenza A virus is probably one of the fastest evolving genes in terms of the rate of nucleotide substitution, which was estimated at 5.7 \u00d7 10\u22123 per site per year [33]. These genes are highly variable so as to enhance the pathogen's ability to evade host defenses.",

Model-based maximum likelihood methods, such as those proposed by Muse and Gaut [35] and Goldman and Yang [36], are a viable and widely used alternative for this purpose. The original maximum likelihood model of Goldman and Yang [36] assumes a single \u03c9 for all lineages and sites and has been extended to account for variation by allowing \u03c9 to vary across lineages [37], among substitution sites [35] or both among sites and among lineages [38]. Lineage-specific models assume that \u03c9 values do not vary among sites and can detect positive selection for a lineage only if the averaged d\nN over all sites is greater than the average d\nS. Site-specific models, conversely, allow \u03c9 to vary among sites but not among lineages. As such, these models can detect positive selection at individual sites only if the averaged d\nN over all lineages is greater than the average d\nS. By allowing \u03c9 to vary both among sites and among lineages, the extended Goldman and Yang model could be applied to detecting positive selection that occurred at multiple time points and affects multiple sites.",

By contrast, drugs that target viral proteins are likely to be more specific and less toxic in nature but with a narrower spectrum of action and higher likelihood of viral drug resistance.

The discovery of novel natural inhibitors for human rhinovirus (HRV) coat protein using a structure-guided search method was described by Rollinger et al. [45]. HRVs are small, non-enveloped, single-stranded RNA enteroviruses belonging to the Picornaviridae family. The viral capsid protein contains a hydrophobic pocket occupied by a pocket factor. Displacing this pocket factor with small antiviral compounds could trigger conformational changes in the capsid protein, which prevent the virus from uncoating and/or attaching to the cell surfaces. A structure-guided search, based on features characteristic for ligand binding in the hydrophobic pocket, was performed on a database of 9676 plant metabolites endowed with antiviral activity. The strategy eventually led to the discovery of asafetida and its constituent compounds, which have selective inhibitory activity against HRV serotype 2. Other structure-guided lead discovery initiatives targeting viral proteins have also been reported, including those against dengue virus envelope protein [46], HIV type 1 integrase [47] and hepatitis C virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [48].",

Such epitopes could offer broader protection across diverse subtypes and are particularly useful against pathogens with pandemic potential, such as the influenza A virus [54]. Another approach is to identify \u2018promiscuous\u2019 peptides that could bind to a wide repertoire of HLA molecules [55]. By making sure that the most frequent HLA molecules will bind to at least one of the peptides in the vaccine cocktail, this method enables the design of broad-based peptide vaccines with improved population coverage. Halling-Brown et al.\n[56] have shown that vaccine antigens contain fewer predicted HLA-binding peptides that control bacterial proteins in most subcellular locations.

One important challenge will be how to integrate the methods of various technology advances and make sense of the data generated using these techniques. In the next few years, it is expected that more sophisticated methods will emerge to enable integrated data analysis and higher level experimental design.

Here, the sequence homology between proteins of the 2009 triple reassortant influenza A (H1N1) virus, which contain gene segments from human, swine and avian influenza A viruses, and their closest ancestors are shown. Multiple sequence alignment was performed using ClustalX, on 41 012 non-redundant influenza A sequences extracted from GenBank and SwissProt.",
