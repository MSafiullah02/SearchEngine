Infection of healthy adults with HRV can lead to a self\u2010limited upper respiratory tract illness, also known as the common cold, but it can cause more\u2010severe disease in elderly patients, such as exacerbations of chronic lung disease, pneumonia, and death.\n1\n, \n2\n Several reports of HRV outbreaks in elderly patients have been described.\n3\n, \n4\n, \n5\n, \n6\n An outbreak of rhinovirus in a long\u2010term care facility (LTCF) causing severe disease in the province of Ontario during the 2009 pandemic of influenza A H1N1 (pH1N1) is reported.",

The local Department of Public Health received notification of a respiratory outbreak on July 13, 2009. Outbreak control measures at the facility were implemented, and local physicians performed medical management. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected and tested using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reactin for the presence of adenovirus, influenza A/B, parainfluenzae 1 to 3, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A and B, rhinovirus A, and coronavirus OC43/229E/NL63 viruses using the Seeplex RV kit (Seegene USA, Rockville, MD) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In addition, standard viral and bacterial cultures, rapid antigen testing for influenza A/B and RSV, Legionella direct fluorescent antibody and culture and urine antigen, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae/Chlamydophila pneumoniae nucleic acid testing were performed.",

HRV was identified in five of 14 nasopharyngeal swabs from symptomatic residents; no other pathogens (viral or bacterial) were detected. Seven deaths occurred during this outbreak. Six fatalities were identified as due to pneumonia or respiratory infection and one due to \u201cfailure to thrive\u201d related to a fractured femur. To determine the virus type, the 5\u2032 UTR, VP4/VP2, and VP1 regions of HRV\u2010positive samples were amplified and sequenced. Nucleotide sequence showed 93% homology to HRV\u2010A 33 strain ATCC VR\u2010330 (accession number FJ445128).

In a study from the United Kingdom of community\u2010dwelling older adults, HRV accounted for 52% of identified respiratory pathogens, with a lower\u2010respiratory tract clinical presentation in 64% of cases.\n7\n Several reports have documented the importance of rhinovirus infection in elderly patients, and the high mortality described here is consistent with recent published reports.\n2\n, \n5\n, \n6\n Detection of rhinoviruses has long been a problem for clinical identification, because the extreme diversity of these viruses renders the immunofluorescence antigen detection method not useful, and the cytopathic effects associated with HRV are often spurious, rendering viral culture unreliable.\n8\n, \n9\n Moreover, because multiple serotypes exist, of retrospective serology cannot be used to evaluate the burden of HRV disease.\n2\n As a result, a significant underestimate of the number of outbreaks and the recognition of morbidity and mortality associated with HRV is likely. Nucleic acid testing is a more\u2010sensitive tool than viral culture for diagnosis of HRV A and B and may be the only way to detect HRV\u2010C.\n9\n, \n10\n\n",

Because specimens from the lower respiratory tract (e.g., bronchoscopy or autopsy) were not available it is not possible to state with certainty that rhinovirus was present in the lower respiratory tract of all fatalities, although because no other pathogens were found despite extensive microbiological investigation, it is likely that HRV was the main cause of this outbreak and related deaths. In conclusion, rhinovirus can present with severe and lethal disease and mimic other severe respiratory viral illnesses. Because this outbreak occurred temporally during the North American influenza A H1N1 pandemic, multiplex nucleic acid\u2013based respiratory testing was the cornerstone in differentiating rhinoviruses from influenza and in steering outbreak management, antiviral use, and vaccination. Because lower respiratory tract infections are leading contributors to significant morbidity in LTCF and are due to an undetermined etiology in more than half of cases when using traditional methods such as antigen testing and viral culture, prompt diagnosis using molecular tools will be increasingly important in outbreak settings such as LTCFs.",
