The main infectious sources are not only patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 with clinical symptoms but also infected individuals without clinical symptoms as well [1, 4, 6] . Evidence has clearly shown that patients may transmit the virus during the viral incubation period when clinical symptoms are absent. The SARS-CoV-2 is primarily spread through respiratory droplets from an infected individual in close contact. Case-based evidence suggests the existence of aerosol and fecal-oral transmission [7] . Whether transmission can occur through mother-infant vertically or through breastfeeding has not yet been determined. Some studies are also focusing on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the urine of infected patients. Previous studies conducted during SARS2003 showed that the SARSrelated coronavirus could not be identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or viral culture in the PD effluent of SARS patients who received PD, but that the stool PCR remained positive for 5 weeks [8] . Whether or not SARS-CoV-2 is present in the PD effluent of patients has not yet been reported. Table 1 shows the diagnostic classifications of COVID-19, including suspected cases and confirmed cases.",

Dialysis patients with underlying lung disease and those on immunosuppressive medications are at an even higher risk for infection-related complications. An important article recently published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) showed that in an experience from Wuhan, China, hospital-related transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was suspected in 41.3% of infected patients with COVID-19, indicative of the potential risk of hospitalization to patient outcome [9] . In turn, the factors associated with an increased risk for contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection among pediatric chronic dialysis patients, especially those who receive in-center HD, include the following: (a) compromised immune system (the result of long-term malnutrition, uremia, and/or immunosuppressants); (b) close proximity to other Preventive and control strategies for in-center HD Staff management (Table 2 )",
