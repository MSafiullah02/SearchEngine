To protect the confidentiality of hospitals, researchers compiled a list of the 100 hospitals and directly e-mailed the directors of each infection control unit, inviting them to respond to the Web-based survey. To increase survey response rates, repeat contact by weekly e-mail was made over 4 weeks. Only 1 person in each institution participated in the survey. The study protocol was approved by the institutional review boards prior to starting the study, and the requirement for informed consent was waived (AN15359-001).",

Three facilities (7.3%) have complied with the regulation of infection prevention and control since the introduction of legislation. Five hospitals (12.2%) employed a full-time ICP. Thirteen hospitals (31.7%) introduced the use of disposable tissue towels, and 3 hospitals (7.3%) introduced hand sanitizers and disinfectants. Twenty-three facilities (51.6%) introduced a monitoring and feedback program for hand hygiene in 2010, and 15 hospitals (36.6%) commenced regular education seminars for MDRO infection prevention and control. A significant increase was observed between 2009 and 2014 in the median number of personnel specialized in infection control within each hospital (1.6 \u00b1 1.2 vs 2.4 \u00b1 1.9, P = .011). Between 2009 and 2014, monitoring of the prevalence of MRSA (57.4% vs 42.6%, P = .118) and VRE (60.0% vs 40.0%, P = .024) and active surveillance for carriers of MRSA (66.7% vs 33.3%, P = .022) and VRE (64.3% vs 35.7%, P = .062) were scaled down. Conversely, monitoring (12.5% vs 87.5%, P < .001) and active surveillance programs (11.1% vs 88.9%, P = .013) for CRE were strengthened, whereas there were no changes in monitoring or active surveillance programs for carriers of MRPA and MRAB during this time. In terms of isolation practices, using a single room or a cohort program followed similar trends to the MDRO detection policies: isolation of patients with MRSA (75.0% vs 25.0%, P = .026) or VRE (60.9% vs 39.1%, P < .001) was stopped in some hospitals, whereas isolation of patients with CRE (15.4% vs 84.6%, P < .001) was introduced in others.",

Patients with known or suspected infectious diseases acquired by contact or droplet routes or airborne droplet nuclei should be physically isolated from other patients.9 The use of single-room isolation with adherence to the requirements of isolation can be a cornerstone in the prevention and control of MDROs in hospitals.10 However, this practice is a challenge in the ROK where hospitals are largely organized in multibed rooms, with insufficient numbers of single rooms.

Promoting the training and appointment of specialist personnel to support and expand infection prevention and control programs should be the ongoing focus of effective policy-oriented management.

It is likely that the emergence of carbapenem-resistant organisms will result in changes in the choice of organisms for active surveillance cultures. However, facilities have great diversity in their approach to preventing gram-negative MDROs. The definitions of multidrug resistance and the criteria of isolation were not even unified, compared with those for gram-positive MDROs.20 On the other hand, the centralized management of the increase in MDROs can be temporarily effective, under conditions of finite resources. However, a comprehensive and multifaceted approach simultaneously covering the various MDROs should be designed to minimize opportunity costs.21\n",

However, the current fee-for-service payment system in the ROK does not offer reasonable incentives for infection prevention and control programs. Reflecting on the current state of the health care system, our study found a shortage of skilled workforce and inferior facilities for handwashing and a shortage of single rooms in relatively scaled-down hospitals. The lack of financial incentives for these activities potentially limits quantitative and qualitative improvement in infection prevention and control programs. A reasonable medical insurance fee should be established based on the multidisciplinary approach for effective execution of ideal infection prevention and control programs.",
