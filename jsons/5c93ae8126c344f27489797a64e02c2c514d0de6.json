Early and rapid diagnosis is necessary so that the infected dogs can be isolated to prevent the spread of the disease and also to administer supportive treatment to reduce morbidity and mortality.

However, these assays require 2-4 h, special equipments and technical expertise. Therefore, a novel nucleic acid amplification method, termed loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), which amplifies specific DNA sequences under isothermal conditions within 60 min, was developed as a simple, rapid, specific and cost-effective alternative (Notomi et al. 2000) . Specific amplification can be detected by observing directly the turbidity (Mori et al. 2001) , the fluorescence after adding DNA-binding dyes like propidium iodide (Hill et al. 2008) or by the presence of ladder-like multiple bands on 2AE0% agarose gel (Parida et al. 2006) .",

A change of colour from reddish orange to pink under ambient light (Fig. 2b) and fluorescence under UV light by propidium iodide indicated a positive reaction (Fig. 2c) . All the LAMP products were also subjected to 2% agarose gel electrophoresis for confirmation. Of the 140 samples screened by LAMP, 104 samples (74AE28%) were positive yielding bands in ladder-like pattern upon 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. All the 140 samples were also screened by conventional PCR using H primers, and 81 samples (57AE85%) were found as positive yielding 630-bp products (Fig. 3a,b) . McNemar test was performed to compare the sensitivities of both the assays, and the P value obtained was <0AE0001 which suggests that the proportion of positive results is significantly different for the two assays ( Table 3 ). The specificity of the LAMP assay was confirmed using template DNA prepared from canine adenovirus 1, canine coronavirus, canine distemper virus and Leptospira icterohemorrhagiae. No amplification products were detected in the above template DNA, whereas only CPV-2, new CPV 2a and new CPV 2b strains showed positive reactions (Fig. 4) . The specificity of the amplified products was further confirmed by bidirectional custom sequencing of the LAMP products by employing outer primers and the sequences of the amplified products perfectly aligned with nucleotide sequences of CPV available in GenBank database (Supporting information Table S1 ). The sensitivity of LAMP and PCR assays were determined and compared by subjecting the templates prepared from serially diluted (tenfold) CPV-2 strain (10 6AE5 TCID 50 ml )1 ) in faecal emulsions. The detection limits of LAMP and PCR assays were 0AE0001 TCID 50 ml )1 and 1000 TCID 50 ml )1 , respectively (Fig. 5a,b) .",

Moreover, the size of the amplicon was 630 bp, and a longer amplicon size would have resulted in false negative result in few cases as it has been demonstrated by Tilley (2004) during PCR amplification of wheat sequences from DNA.
