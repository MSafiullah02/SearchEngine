Effective treatment, however, was not possible at that time; prevention and spread of infectious diseases depended solely on proper hygienic means. At the beginning of the 20th century, passive and active vaccination procedures were developed against a number of these pathogenic micro-organisms to prevent the diseases in question (rabies, diphtheria, tetanus, etc.) . Thanks to the discovery of antimicrobial chemicals (by Paul Ehrlich) and antibiotics (by Sir Alexander Fleming), the threat of infectious diseases seemed to be minimised. Large scale vaccination programmes against childhood diseases (diphtheria, whooping cough and polio), started in the early 1950s, raised hopes of finally being able to eradicate these diseases from the planet. This approach was successful for smallpox (1980) . However, new infectious diseases have emerged [e.g., Legionella, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Helicobacter, SARS, etc.] and new vaccines and antibiotics are needed. Furthermore, due to intensive medical treatment with antibiotics and immunosuppressive drugs, hospital infections are a growing problem. Bacteria hitherto deemed harmless are causing opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients. The pathogens have developed resistance to many antibiotics and sometimes no effective antibiotics are available to treat these patients.",

The ingestion by phagocytic cells of the micro-organism is enhanced by serum proteins (opsonins), such as antibodies and the C3b component of complement, which are recognised by specific receptors on the phagocytes. After ingestion, the particle is surrounded by the membrane of the phagocyte, forming a vacuole known as a phagosome. The phagosome then fuses with some of the countless granules in the phagocyte, thus allowing the lysosomal microbicidal agents and enzymes to do their work. The formation of toxic oxygen radicals greatly contributes to the killing and elimination of the ingested micro-organism ( Fig. 1 ) (see chapter A7).",

This bond is very strong (i.e. has a high affinity), and is difficult to break by the administration of antibodies. In practice, if there are clinical symptoms of the disease, then large doses of antitoxins must be administered. If one is trying to prevent the development of the disease, then the presence of small quantities of specific antibodies (IgG) is sufficient. The adherence of bacteria to cells is effectively blocked by IgA. Oral vaccination against cholera, for example, is aimed at obtaining sufficient specific IgA in the intestine, so that no colonisation of this bacterium can take place, and the cholera toxin can no longer adhere to its receptor.",

Therefore, it seems that TLR2 and TLR4 are activated primarily by different PAMP to initiate the host response to Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial infection, respectively. This is further illustrated by the fact that TLR2 (but not TLR4) knockout mice are highly susceptible to gram-positive bacteria, like Staphylococcus aureus, whereas TLR4 (but not TLR2) knockout mice are highly susceptible to Gram-negative bacteria such as Salmonella typhimurium.",

LPShyporesponsive TLR4-deficient C3H/HeJ mice are made responsive by transfer of macrophages of a closely related LPS-sensitive strain. When the host is challenged with LPS, soluble factors are produced by macrophages that mediate fever and an acute-phase response. These factors include the proinflammatory cytokines, il-1, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1. Together, TNF-\u03b1 and il-1 stimulate endothelial cells to produce and express proteins on their membrane that have adhesive properties for leukocytes, promoting the margination and passage of neutrophils from blood vessels through the endothelial layer, leading to neutrophil influx into the tissue. adhesion molecules that mediate the binding of neutrophils appear on the endothelium after an inflammatory stimulus, followed by molecules that are specific for adhesion of monocytes or lymphocytes, which may be why neutrophils enter before mononuclear cells. Molecules that are currently known to be involved in leukocyte-endothelium interactions belong to three structural groups: the immunoglobulin gene superfamily, the integrin family, and the selectin family.",

The CD4 molecule, together with other receptor molecules, like chemokine receptor CCR5, acts as a binding site for the gp120 envelope glycoprotein of the virus. In an attempt to respond to HIV antigens and concomitant secondary microbial infections, these cells are activated, thus inducing the replication of HIV in the infected CD4 T cells, which are finally destroyed. In contrast, HIV-1 infection of macrophages is self-sustained and results in an inexorable growth of chronic active inflammatory processes in many tissue compartments including the central nervous system. Infected cells bear the fusion protein gp41 and may therefore fuse with other infected cells. This helps the virus to spread and accounts for the multinucleated cells seen in lymph nodes and brain. As a result of the decreased numbers of CD4 + Th cells and defects in antigen presentation, depressed immune responses in these patients are observed. During the progression of the disease, opportunistic infections by otherwise harmless micro-organisms can occur. These include Can dida albicans oesophagitis, mucocutaneous herpes simplex, toxoplasma in the central nervous system, and pneumonia caused by toxoplasma and Pneumo cystis carinii; Kaposi's sarcoma also occurs frequently in these patients. This has been linked to the presence of a previously unknown type of herpes virus (HHV-8). This immune deficiency syndrome is called 'acquired immune deficiency syndrome' (AIDS). It has been suggested that infected monocytes/macrophages carry the HIV virus into the brain where it replicates in microglia and infiltrating macrophages. As a consequence, many AIDS patients develop cognitive and motor brain impairments. However, the picture is complicated by the various persistent infections already present in these patients, which give rise to their own pathology in the brain. These include Toxoplasma gondii, Cryptococcus neoformans and JC virus.",

The main effort in the prevention of hiv infection lies 135 Human immunodeficiency virus infection in mass public education programmes. Treatment of infected individuals is possible but expensive. highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) reduces morbidity and mortality among patients infected with HIV (see Fig. 5 ). Success is limited by the emergence of drug-resistance viruses that can be transmitted to newly infected individuals. Resistance, drug toxicity, and poor patient adherence lead to treatment failure and necessitate continuous development of alternative treatment strategies that intervene with the HIV replication cycle: i.e. on the level of virus entry, critical viral enzymes [reverse transcriptase (RT), integrase (IN) and proteases (PR)] or viral nucleocapsid (NC) protein. At this moment a triple therapy is being prescribed in Western countries (two RT inhibitors and one PR inhibitor, Fig. 4) , each of which interfere with specific steps in the process of HIV replication. One major problem that has arisen is the increasing resistance to these drugs. Agents with novel mechanisms of action provide options for patients with drug-resistant virus. Blocking of the chemokine receptor CCR5, a co-receptor on CD4 cells for HIV, is an alternative treatment for persons infected with the R5 HIV type. This notion is supported by a recent finding that a homozygous defect in this chemokine receptor accounts for resistance of multiple-exposed individuals to HIV-1 infection. Currently a commercially available drug is being used that specifically binds to CCR5 on the surface of the CD4 cell and selectively blocks HIV-1 binding.",

            "text": "of antibiotics, all work on new bacterial vaccines was suspended or severely curtailed, although some researchers continued to work on viral vaccines, such as rubella, measles, polio, and mumps.Since it has proved difficult to consistently develop new antibiotics to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria, interest in vaccines has gradually increased over the last 15 years (see chapter C1). Today, thanks to new insights into the immune system and modern molecular biological and chemical techniques of analysis and synthesis, it is possible to produce well-defined vaccines. These contain only those determinants of the pathogenic micro-organism that induce protection (epitopes). These epitopes are usually short peptide or oligosaccharide chains, which can be produced synthetically or by means of recombinant DNA techniques. The immunogenicity of these products can be enhanced by coupling them to a carrier (tetanus toxoid, liposomes) and/or by adding an adjuvant (a substance that strengthens the immune response non-specifically). The recombinant DNA technique can also be used to obtain attenuated strains of micro-organisms, which are fully immunogenic and thus provide protection, but which are no longer virulent. One example of this is the development of a new cholera vaccine based on a bacterium that has all the characteristics of a virulent strain, except the toxin. The bacterium has retained all its adherence factors, which allow it to adhere to the intestinal mucosa; the length of time it spends in the intestine is sufficient to stimulate the local immune system. The newest trend in vaccinology is immunisation by introducing plasmid DNA into the host. Success has been attained by this method for hepatitis B vaccination.Not only are new vaccines being developed, but it is also possible to heighten natural resistance for longer or shorter periods. Various interleukins (il-2, GM-CSF) and interferons are being studied in order to use them to combat infectious diseases (see chapter C7). Passive antibody therapy with polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies (mouse or human IgG with single specificity) for infectious diseases is experiencing a renewed interest. Targeting soluble factors (like neutralisation of bacterial toxins and viruses) or common structures (like bacterial adhesins or viral entry factors) in high-risk patient groups may be ben-eficial alone or may enhance the therapeutic efficacy of other drugs. Targets for clinical development of monoclonal antibodies include multi-resistant staphylococci and enterococci, Bacillus anthracis toxin, HIV, hepatitis c virus (HCV), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).",

            "text": "As outlined above for a number of bacteria and viruses, effective vaccines have been developed and applied worldwide. The eradication of smallpox (Variola major) virus in the 1970s was a milestone for the World Health Organisation. The next goal of the WHO is to eradicate poliovirus in the coming years. Major problems to be dealt with are the distribution of these vaccines, the costs involved, the registration and the compliance of the vaccinees and molecular techniques to trace the final bug. Meanwhile new unexpected microbiological threats become in focus. Hospital infections caused by multi-resistant micro-organism due to the abundance use of antibiotics and exchange of genetic material between micro-organisms impose major problems on patients and healthcare workers. New antibiotics and/or vaccines should be developed and new strategies employed to contain these infections. Due to crowding and the high mobility of the world population, old and new pathogens, e.g. influenza and SARS, threaten our society. The recent influenza A H1N1 (\"Mexican\") flu outbreak in 2009 demonstrated how rapidly a new strain of flu can emerge and spread around the world. The sudden outbreak of this novel flu virus has tested the world's public health preparedness. In the Netherlands, Q fever emerged with large epidemic outbreaks. Q fever is a zoonotic disease, that is passed from infected (farm) animals (cattle, sheep, and goats are the primary carriers) to humans. Q fever is a disease caused by the intracellular bacterium Coxiella burnetii. Organisms are excreted in milk, urine, and faeces of infected animals. Most importantly, during birthing the organisms are shed in high numbers within the amniotic fluids and the placenta. C. burnetii is resistant to heat, drying, and many common disinfectants, allowing it 137 Infections in the new millennium 138 Immune response in human pathology: Infections caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites to survive for a long time in the environment. People can become infected by inhalation of the bacteria, but the risk of infection is low. Only about one-half of all people infected with C. burnetii show signs of clinical illness (e.g. flu-like illness, pneumonia, and hepatitis). Q fever can be treated with antibiotics, and most people will recover fully. As a control measurement pregnant goats on dairy farms had to be killed and a mandatory vaccination campaign was started.On top of this, terrorists might intentionally use micro-organisms (smallpox, anthrax, plague etc.), or bacterial toxins (botulism) to cause death and disease in humans or animals in a civilian setting. The recognition that an event was caused by a biological weapon presents a severe challenge to be prepared for such an attack, especially for medical care providers, and public health officials. Strategies to combat bioterrorism have to be worked out but with the experience of 100 years of combating micro-organisms with hygiene measures, vaccination, antibiotic and anti-viral treatment, there must be a way out.",
