            "text": "The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a novel coronavirus first described in the Arabian Peninsula in 2012.1 Humans may become infected through contact with contaminated respiratory secretions from infected patients or animals (mainly dromedaries). Although human-to-human transmission of the virus is low, MERS-CoV has been known to spread from ill people to others through close contact such as caring for or living with an infected person. Thus, transmission of MERS-CoV is more likely to occur in healthcare facilities,2 with most of the cases reported having been associated with nosocomial outbreaks.3 As of July 2017, 2040 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV have been reported to the World Health Organization. To date, all cases of MERS have been linked to travel or residence in countries in and near the Arabian Peninsula. Moreover, exported cases3 and outbreaks2 outside the Arabian Peninsula have also been shown. The clinical syndrome ranges from asymptomatic and mild respiratory symptoms to severe acute respiratory disease and death, with a case fatality rate of ~35%.4,5 To achieve early detection and avoid the transmission of the virus, suspicion of MERS-CoV should be raised whenever there are compatible clinical symptoms (acute febrile respiratory illness) and an epidemiological link (person resides or has travelled within a 14-day period before symptom initiation to the Middle East or any of the countries where MERS-CoV is known to be circulating in dromedary camels or where human infections have recently occurred).6 In addition, adequate measures of infection prevention and control should be taken until MERS-CoV infection is ruled out. Initial symptoms of MERS-COV are non-specific and may resemble those of other respiratory agents. Having an accurate and early microbiological diagnosis without delaying MERS-CoV testing seems reasonable to improve patient management. In this study we evaluated the clinical and epidemiological aspects of the patients with suspicion of MERS-CoV attended in our centre and the definitive respiratory aetiology identified through a comprehensive panel test.",

These guidances specify that any patient with an epidemiologic risk and severe ore miler respiratory illness should be considered as a patient under investigation for MERS-CoV.

Respiratory samples (nasopharyngeal swabs and whenever possible a sputum) were collected and sent to the Microbiology laboratory. For the detection of MERS-CoV, RNA extraction of inactivated samples was performed using an automated system (QiaSymphony; Quiagen, Hilden, Germany) followed by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting upstream of the upE gene, encoding protein E, as described previously.9,10 Synthetic RNA standards were used as the positive control. Additionally, all nasopharyngeal swabs samples were tested with a multiplex PCR system (FilmArray Respiratory Pannel, BioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy l\u2019Etoile, France). This is an integrated and automated system which allows the detection of 17 viral agents (influenza viruses A and B, parainfluenza viruses 1\u20134, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, bocavirus, coronaviruses HKU1, NL63, 229E and OC43, metapneumovirus, human rhinovirus/enterovirus) and 3 bacterial agents (Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydophila pnuemoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae) in 1 h.
