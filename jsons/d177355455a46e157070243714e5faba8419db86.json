As long as a suitable screening test is not available, a first important preventive strategy is the exclusion of blood from donors who were exposed to a possible risk of infection. Thus, blood plasma from the UK must not be used in the manufacture of blood derivatives any longer. Furthermore, persons are excluded as potential blood donors who have spent a total of more than one year in the UK or Northern Ireland between 1980 and 1996. To expand the exclusion to individuals who have themselves received blood transfusion before is opined to be not acceptable in view of the prevailing blood shortage [56] . As a second measure, blood and cellular blood components have to be depleted from the 'buffy coat' (leucoreduction), to remove potentially present vCJD pathogens. Although the real effect of leucoreduction on TSE infectivity still has to be proven, the removal of leukocytes is anyway an advantage because of the adverse effects caused by leucocytes. Concerning plasma-derived medicinal products, the manufacturing process should be optimized to the effect that the infectivity of plasma is further reduced as it is already indicated by available data. It is further suggested to recall batches of plasma-derived medicinal products where a donor to a plasma pool subsequently develops vCJD. But regarding these measures, it has to be considered that the thinkable risk of a vCJD transmission is not exchanged for the real risk caused by a shortage of life-saving blood and blood products. To guarantee the long-term stability of blood supply, suitable promotion and motivation campaigns for recruiting blood donors should be carried out. In addition, Germany started an initiative for 'optimum use' of blood products in 1999 [54] , which is now generally recommended. This means to avoid the use of blood and blood products wherever possible and represents the best way to reduce a potential risk on transmission.
