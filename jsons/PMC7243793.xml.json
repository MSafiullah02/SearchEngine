It was speculated that the first patient caught the infection from a seafood market that also traded wild animals. The causing agent was quickly identified as a novel coronavirus (CoV). The CoV responsible for the outbreak is now called SARS-CoV-2. The respiratory illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 is called COVID-19. The symptoms of the SARS-CoV-2 infection range from asymptomatic to mild to severe to death.1 It soon became clear that person-to-person transmission was also occurring, as was the case with the previous human CoV. In an unprecedented documented speed, the SARS-CoV-2 travels around the globe, and as of April 27th led to >3.0 million infections and 200,000 fatalities. Based on the previous experience with the SARS-CoV outbreak at the beginning of this century, very stringent measures were taken by the Chinese government, and several multimillion-inhabitant cities were isolated and put under quarantine in order to slow the pandemic spread. Different hosts of the SARS-CoV-2 are proposed, including snails, bats, and pangolins.2\n",

Under the electron microscope, they exhibit formations that are reminiscent of the solar corona. The common cold is often caused by human CoVs. They are single-stranded enveloped positive RNA viruses and stand out because of their rather large genome. As with viruses in general, the structure is rather simple. SARS-CoV-2 is generally less pathogenic than SARS-CoV, much less pathogenic than the Middle East respiratory syndrome MERS-CoV, but more pathogenic than practically harmless HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63. The reported case-fatality rate of COVID-19 is \u22643% and is thus rather low as compared with SARS (30%, Table 1\n). However, the transmission rate (TR) (number of newly infected people per infected person) of 2.5 to 3 is high and accounts for the danger of the current pandemic. For comparison, the TR of the yearly common cold is less than 1.4.",

In principle, there are several potential strategies to pharmacologically fight COVID-19: vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, oligonucleotide-based therapies, peptides, interferon therapies, small-molecule drugs, or natural medicines (e.g., traditional Chinese medicine [TCM]). The timelines for de novo development of a small-molecule drug are historically >6\u20137 years, and in the best case less than 2 years. Vaccines can be developed much faster, but rapid development in the range of 1\u20132 years is very challenging. Antibodies to support the body\u2019s immune system are also a strategy to combat viral diseases. Again, the typical development timelines are several years. Therefore, is there a hope for a rapid drug to come to the market? A strategy that is promising in the current situation is drug repurposing. Drug repurposing aims to discover novel indication areas for already approved drugs.4 The overwhelming advantage of drug repurposing is the potential for much faster approval because of the already extensive knowledge of the drug\u2019s behavior in humans.",

The simple one-pot accessible scaffold by an Ugi-four component condensation was the key to rapidly generate structure activity relationship (SAR) for the putative P2-P1 and P1 subgroups. An optimized version ML188 (7) was designated as the probe status (Figure 3\n). A P3 truncated version of 8 allowing for significant molecular weight (MW) reduction without diminishing potency was developed as a second probe ML300 (9) with potent enzyme inhibition and cellular activity. These compounds comprise rare examples of a noncovalent SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitor of moderate MW with good enzyme and antiviral inhibitory activity. However, these molecules suffer from extensive metabolism and rapid clearance. Nonetheless, they are a promising starting point for further drug development.",

The structure, function, and inhibition of the SARS-CoV PLpro has been extensively reviewed.24 Although the primary function of PLpro and 3CLpro is to process the viral polyprotein in a coordinated manner, PLpro has the additional function of stripping ubiquitin and ISG15 from host-cell proteins to help CoV to evade the host innate immune responses. Therefore, it was recently argued that targeting PLpro with antiviral drugs might have an advantage in not only inhibiting viral replication but also inhibiting the dysregulation of signaling cascades in infected cells that might lead to cell death in surrounding, uninfected cells.24 Different compounds forming a covalent bond to the active-site Cys112 have been described, including epoxyketones, \u03b1-halo-ketones, alkynes, aldehydes, trifluoromethyl ketones, \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketone, activated esters, or vinyl sulfones.",

However, chloroquine inhibits endosomal acidification and thus could stop the release of viral DNA into the cytoplasm. It is under assessment in more than 100 patients at over ten hospitals in Beijing and Guangdong province. Plans for an additional study in Hunan province are underway.",

For the assembly of the replication/transcription complexes, there is a vast interaction network described between the non-structural proteins. Similarly, viral particle assembly requires orchestrated interaction between N, S, M, and E proteins. All these interactions can be potential targets, but the structural information is currently minimal. Resolution of the protein and complex structures will provide new unique drug targets. For example, the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 N protein RNA-binding domain was just published and will give structural insight as a potential drug target.44 It is rapidly detected by antibodies in serum, plasma, and peripheral blood, and might therefore serve to develop specific diagnostics.",

The rapid worldwide spread and the high human-to-human transmissibility, combined with the inability to contain the pandemic, is causing an increasing death toll and also considerable paralysis of the world economy (Table 2). The COVID-19 could decrease and disappear or could be established worldwide in the human population and reoccur seasonally in future mutations through zoonosis from one of the animal reservoirs. However, it is very likely that in the upcoming years, we will see more outbreaks from CoV and other viruses. The basic, translational, and public health research communities have to prepare for this much better. The outbreak has emphasized the urgent need for renewed efforts to develop broad-spectrum antiviral agents to combat CoVs. On the positive side, much new information of the virus biology and the spread was immediately shared, whereas, on the negative side, many past opportunities to develop antivirals against CoVs were not taken, despite a large number of promising approaches and compounds.46 The past decade has shown that CoV outbreaks are regularly reoccurring with more or less health effect on human and livestock. It remains to be hoped that the current pandemic will slow down and end as predicted in summer. Furthermore, it turns out that containment measures are not effective to avoid more severe spread. It remains to be seen whether efficient and long-lasting immunity will develop in the infected population with regard to future outbreaks and whether pharmacological measures can be rapidly developed to be able to treat severely sick people.",
