In the present study, we found three kinds of SARS-CoV N proteins with different molecular mass expressed in E. coli and all of them could react with the pooled sera from convalescence phase of SARS patients. Two of the proteins with lower molecular mass may be degraded from the amino terminus of the intact N fusion protein since both could be purified by Ni-NTA affinity resin (the six histidine residues are located at the amino terminal of the fusion protein). In our observation, the N protein is more sensitive to react with sera of SARS patients relative to the S protein of SARS-CoV expressed in E. coli (Zhao et al., 2004). This is consistent with those found in some animal coronaviruses, indicating that the N protein may be a sensitive antigen for SARS-CoV infection (Wesseling et al., 1993). But it is still necessary to observe its time course to evaluate the meaning for early diagnosis of SARS-CoV infection.",

Seventy five percent of the mice developed anti-N IgG antibody after three times of immunization. It is unlikely that the antibodies against N protein play a neutralizing role due to its internal position in the virion. Some researchers reported that antibodies to N protein of murine hepatitis virus (MHV, an animal coronavirus) had no neutralizing activity in vitro, but a monoclonal antibody (MAb) to the protein prevented the cytopathic effect of MHV on L cells, and passive transfer of this antibody protected mice from acute MHV infection (Lecomte et al., 1987, Nakanaga et al., 1986).

There is evident malfunction of cell immunity in SARS patients, which may be one of the important causative factors for this disease (Li et al., 2003). Therefore, to enhance specific cellular immune response by vaccine administration is likely to accelerate the clearance of the virus and represents a potential alternative therapeutic method against SARS. As an internal protein of SARS-CoV, N protein is more conserved than surface protein such as S or M proteins, which makes it an ideal candidate for inclusion in a broadly protective vaccine for induction of cellular immune response. It was reported that vaccination with adenovirus vector expressing N protein of MHV could protect a significant fraction of mice against a lethal infection, which indicates that the N protein can generate a protective immune response (Wasmoen et al., 1995, Wesseling et al., 1993). Splenic lymphocytes derived from plasmid pCI-N inoculated mice stimulated with recombinant N protein in vitro demonstrated significant proliferative responses, whereas the mice failed to respond to a control antigen transferrin.",

Th2 cells produce IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, and IL-13, which are important for humoral responses (Gor et al., 2003, Maldonado-Lopez and Moser, 2001, Mosmann, 1992). To distinguish the activation between Th1 and Th2 subsets, profiles of cytokines released by N-stimulated splenocytes were examined. Immunization of mice with plasmids pCI-N resulted in a significant increase in Th1 cytokine production. IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 levels were increased more than 10- to 30-fold, respectively. The production of the Th2 cytokine IL-4 and IL-10 by stimulated splenocytes was also increased 5- to 6-fold in animals inoculated with N protein expression plasmid. These results indicated that the expression of N protein by DNA vaccine activated both Th1 and Th2 subsets, although the activation level of Th1 subset was much more significant.

CD8+ T cells recognize viral antigens in the form of short peptides presented by MHC class I molecules on the surface of virus-infected cells. The recognition of these viral peptides in the context of MHC molecules by CD8+ T cells can trigger the specific lysis of virally infected cells (Kagi et al., 1995) or noncytopathic intracellular inactivation of virus mediated by cytokines such as gamma interferon and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (Guidotti and Chisari, 2000, Mosmann et al., 1997). CD8+ CTL has thus been implicated as playing a role in recovery or clearance of virus during animal coronavirus and SARS-CoV infection (Castro and Perlman, 1996, Glass and Lane, 2003, Wang and Chen, 2004).",

More importantly, generation of DTH activity occurred independent of anti-N antibodies, which suggests that CD8+ T cell activation may be induced by N protein without a coexisting humoral immune response. The four test mice all developed significant DTH response although two of them failed to produce obvious anti-N antibody. Using the syngeneic BALB/c-derived P815 mastocytoma cells that stably express SARS-CoV N protein as target cells, we observed that the splenocytes from pCI-N immunized mice showed significant CTL activity, which could kill the N protein-expressing target efficiently, but could not kill the native P815 target cells. Our data on the DTH reaction assessed using footpad swelling and results of the CTL assay clearly demonstrated that SARS-CoV-specific CMI was elicited by the DNA construct pCI-N. Recently, the cytotoxic T lymphocyte response targeted to SARS-CoV N protein by DNA immunization was also reported by Zhu et al. (2004) and Kim et al. (2004). Together with our findings, we believe that the N protein of SARS-CoV is an important immunogen for T lymphocytes and may play a concernful role in immunity-mediated virus elimination.",

Gao et al.
