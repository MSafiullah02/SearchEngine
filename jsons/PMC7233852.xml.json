Unfortunately, stewardship\nis complicated by the fact that most initial antibiotic use is empiric, with\nthe physician not knowing the identity or antibiotic resistances of the\npathogen, if one is grown at all, until 2\u20133 days into therapy. In\ncountries with moderate rates of resistance, including the United States and\nmuch of Europe, this leads to precautionary overtreatment, with\nbroad-spectrum antibiotics given to patients who transpire either to have\nnot-very-resistant pathogens or not to have bacterial infections. In\ncountries with high rates of resistance and particularly where\ncarbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacteria are prevalent (as in India),\nthe delay in pathogen identification leads to forced empiric use of less\neffective and potentially toxic agents, notably colistin combinations. In\nsome cases, even these fail to cover the pathogen(s) ultimately grown.",

Moreover, even in\nclinical trials, only around 30\u201340% of CAP patients have a pathogen\ngrown; in routine practice, the proportion with a clear microbiological\ndiagnosis was only 28.5%.6 Major factors here are (i)\nthat common CAP pathogens, notably, Streptococcus\npneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, are\ndifficult to culture, leading to low recovery rates and (ii) that when\nscanty or mixed opportunist organisms are grown from HAP and VAP patients as\ncommon with sputa and ETA samples the microbiologist must make a subjective\njudgment of their significance. Furthermore, HAP and VAP are difficult to\ndiagnose clinically in patients with other multiple pathologies.7 These multiple diagnostic uncertainties are reflected (i)\nin variations in treatment duration, (ii) in patients receiving repeated\ncourses of antibiotics for vague ongoing symptoms thought to be due to a\npneumonia, and (iii) in UK hospital guidelines advocating the antibiotic\ndoxycycline in \u201cmild HAP\u201d despite an inappropriate spectrum\nand a lack of national or international guideline support.8 For community respiratory infections, patient expectation plays a big\nrole in inappropriate antimicrobial prescribing, as do the constraints put\non GPs, including their 10 min consultations in the UK.9",

Their\nwide adoption in this role is partly because detection of a pathogenic\nvirus, which should not be present in a healthy patient, gives a clear\ndiagnosis, whereas detection of a low burden of, for example,\nAcinetobacter in a ventilated ICU patient does not.\nMoreover, classical virology, unlike classical bacteriology, is complex and\ncostly. These systems also potentially allow for the rapid detection of high\nconsequence infections in patients, including Middle East respiratory\nsyndrome (MERS) coronavirus, essential for patient management/infection\ncontrol purposes. If a virus is found, then it may prompt specific antiviral\ntherapy, particularly in the case of influenza. Moreover, finding a\npathogenic virus, including SARS-CoV2, should discourage the use of\nbroad-spectrum antibacterials, though narrower spectrum coverage against\nlikely secondary pathogens (e.g., S. aureus and S.\npneumoniae following influenza) may be preferred.",

Antiviral prescribing was not reviewed. Multivariate\nanalysis identified factors influencing the antibiotic prescribing decision,\nmany related to concerns over secondary bacterial infection.

This divergence\nmay partly reflect the types of specimens used: BALs are more likely to\ncontain a single organism from deep within the lung, whereas sputa are prone\nto more or less substantial contamination by colonizing bacteria from the\nupper airways. In large part, though, we believe that the major issue lies\nin variability in routine bacteriological culture, which is taken as the\nreference \u201cgold standard\u201d for the evaluations summarized in\nthe table. Unfortunately, as noted already, routine culture is far from\nperfect.

Essentially, the microbiologist makes a\njudgment on what is grown and may discount small numbers of potentially\npathogenic organisms, especially if these are heavily mixed with normal\nupper-respiratory-tract flora. We believe that microbiologists\u2019\nreading of these plates is highly variable, basing this conclusion on\nresults from the INHALE study66 presented at the European\nCongress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ECCMID) 2019 and\nnow being prepared for publication.65 We made two\ncritical observations. First, when Curetis Unyvero, BioFire FilmArray, and\n16S rDNA analyses were all applied in parallel to the same respiratory\nsamples, their findings tended to agree, with different\nmolecular systems finding the same organism(s) even when these were not\ngrown by the diagnostic laboratory. Evidently, it is implausible that\ndifferent molecular systems would find the same organism\nunless it was actually present, meaning that it is unreasonable (and\nprejudicial) to call these \u201cfalse positives\u201d. Second, when we\ncompared the results of centrally performed molecular test to locally\nperformed culture results, from the 15 participating sites, we found that\nthe ratio of PCR-positive/culture-positive varied from 29 to 87%. The\nlikeliest explanation of such variation is site-to-site differences in the\nexecution or interpretation of the routine microbiology. We consequently\nbelieve that these molecular systems are not only swifter than conventional\nmicrobiology but also deliver a standardization that is presently absent.\nHowever, it is arguable whether their finding more organisms than culture is\nadvantageous or not: It can be countered that this will promote\npolypharmacy, some of it directed against organisms that were of little or\nno significance or those that were already dead but had left their genetic\nsignatures in the respiratory secretions.",

For INHALE, this algorithm\nwas developed in liaison with microbiology and intensive care at\nparticipating sites, allowing some site-to-site variation (e.g., because\npediatric sites are included and some favored agents lack pediatric\nlicenses), retaining the core principle of preferring the narrowest spectrum\nagent to cover the pathogen(s) found.

Both these values increased to 100% following PCR verification of\ndiscordant results and posthoc specific gene analysis for all H.\ninfluenzae and/or S. pneumoniae positive\nsamples. Resistance genes were found but often without an obvious host being\nrecognized by sequencing or culture. In particular, the authors often found\ntet, erm, and\nblaTEM determinants when the only\npathogen(s) grown remained susceptible to tetracyclines, macrolides, or\n\u03b2-lactams or were organisms inherently unlikely to host these genes.\nIt was inferred that these genes originated in the commensal flora, not the\npathogens, and the scope for uncertainty, if the method was deployed\nclinically, is evident. Bioinformatic analysis of the DNA flanking\nresistance genes might resolve this aspect when resistance genes are\nchromosomally located, but it is less likely to be useful when they are\nplasmid-borne, since the plasmid\u2019s host would remain uncertain. A\nfurther issue remains when as in P. aeruginosa resistance\nis commonly effected by combinations of mechanisms (e.g., upregulation of\nefflux pumps and increased expression of AmpC \u03b2-lactamase) (Table 1), with these upregulations\narising from diverse mutations in any of several regulatory genes. Almost\nall P. aeruginosa isolates have some functioning efflux via\nMexA\u2013MexB\u2013OprM: What matters is the extent to which this\nsystem is expressed as a result of regulatory mutations in\nmexR(84) or is augmented by\nupregulation of multiple further pumps.85 A possible\nsolution is \u201cgenomic neighbor typing\u201d, a method that matches\ngenome sequences from the clinical sample to a database of sequences and\nsusceptibility data from known variants, to find the closest match. Brinda\net al.86 used this approach with nanopore sequence data\nfor S. pneumoniae and Neisseria\ngonorrheae, both organisms where resistance to \u03b2-lactams\ndepends on complex mixtures of mutation and gene recombination, achieving\ngood prediction of susceptibility and resistance within 4 h of sample\ncollection. Future work may allow this bioinformatic strategy to be expanded\nto other \u201cdifficult\u201d organisms, including P.\naeruginosa; nonetheless, these aspects underscore the\ncomplexity of the metagenomic pipelines that will be needed to translate\nsequence data into prescribing decisions. More generally, although the broad\nsteps involved in sequencing are identical across methods, every metagenomic\npipeline is different. Consequently, no uniform algorithm to interpret\nresults in likely to be possible. Nevertheless, key themes will be\nuniversal, such as the threshold number of reads considered significant, and\ncontrolling for contamination.",
