This suggestion was supported by the finding that the patients who had the highest scores on day 1 (114) had an unusually rapid resolution of symptoms compared with patients who had lower scores on day 1. By use of the experimental cold benchmark, there was only a .01 probability that scores of this magnitude would be reported \u044024 h after onset of infection. An alternative explanation for the high scores is that they represented illness due to other viruses, such as influenza virus or adenovirus. The studies were not conducted during influenza epidemics, and it would be unusual for the symptoms of influenza or acute respiratory disease due to adenovirus to resolve as rapidly as reported.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "The total symptom score probability distribution at 24 h for experimental colds and day 1 for natural colds showed that a symptom severity score of \u04407 at 24 h after virus inoculation captured 95% of the experimental colds while excluding 30.5% of the natural colds reported as occurring on day 1 of illness. In future natural cold treatment trials, it may be useful to use a day 1 total symptom score of 17 as an exclusion criterion to help achieve enrollment of patients with early colds and to eliminate bogus cases of illness. In addition, investigators may want to consider enrolling patients \u044012 h after the first recognition of a possible cold symptom.

The patients in the natural cold study in this report were primarily college students. More accurate information may have been collected if an older and more responsible population had been used, as in previous studies [21] . Addition of virologic testing to a natural cold study does not solve the problem. The yield with testing is satisfactory for rhinovirus but not good for the other cold viruses, such as coronavirus [22] . Also, viral testing provides no information on duration of illness. Others have recently commented on the underreporting and fabrication of information in the medical history and of the importance of having a better understanding of this phenomenon [23] . The present study used histories from subjects with natural and experimental colds to further inves- tigate this problem.
