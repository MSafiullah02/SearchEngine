Various centrality measures, such as degree and betweenness, can be employed to determine the importance of a node within a network. For example, the degree is the number of edges that a node has.

One reason for this could have been the availability of contact tracing data. Compared to other infectious diseases, such as influenza, STDs are heavily dependent on personal connections for transmission and hence can be controlled by contact tracing and taking appropriate intervention actions. Another reason may be related to the capability of network presentation. Since SNA was originally developed to study social phenomena via person-to-person linkage, its network presentation is inherently used to portray the relationships between people and contains only individuals as actors in the network graph. This kind of presentation may be sufficient for STDs but is not sophisticated enough to describe the scenarios of indirectcontact or airborne transmission. Klovdahl et al. (2001) addressed this limitation with their investigation of a tuberculosis (TB) outbreak in Houston, Texas. They first used the conventional presentation of SNA and constructed a person-to-person contact network to analyze the outbreak. However, only 12 personal contacts were identified among the 29 patients. Through further collaboration with local healthcare workers, they found that geographical contact was more important than personal contact in understanding the outbreak. By including places such as bars and restaurants in their contact network, they were finally able to connect those 29 patients directly or indirectly in a network (Klovdahl et al., 2001) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 858, "end": 880, "text": "Klovdahl et al.

(2004) also found a positive relationship between attendance at a motel bar and a gonorrhea infection in Alberta, Canada, in 1999 and used a contact network with the motel bar to demonstrate this connection. Based on these studies, many researchers believe that it is important to examine the social context of disease transmission in a contact network. Geographical locations are places of aggregation and create opportunities for social interaction. Including geographical locations in contact networks can not only help to reveal potential places for indirect or casual transmission contact, but can also help to identify social context which groups people and facilitates pathogen transfer. Table 15 -3 summarizes several SNA epidemiology studies in chronological order. Although Klovdahl's conceptual paper was published in 1985, the application of SNA in STD investigation did not start until the Colorado Springs study in 1994. Through the Colorado Springs study, SNA not only empirically demonstrated its ability to support contact tracing but also examined structural evolution of contact networks. Since then, STD with sexual contact has been the focus of analysis. In 2001, SNA was further applied to TB.

The types of contacts we investigated in this analysis are listed in Table 15-5.  Table 15 -6 shows our results for the two main categories of contacts. After applying all available records, we can reduce the number of components in the network from 961 to 10.

In contrast, the geographical contacts reduce the number of com-ponents to 82.

Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of a contact 3. Assume that you have a set of STD contact tracing data. It includes patients' sexual contacts, patronized bars and motels, and demographic information, such as patients' residency, gender, age, occupation, and income level. Discuss the kinds of analysis that can potentially be performed with this dataset and list your steps to investigate them using SNA. 4.
