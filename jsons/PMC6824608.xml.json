We have no COPD-specific biomarkers and the diagnosis is often one of exclusion. This is in contrast to many other acute presentations of chronic diseases, such as a myocardial infarction (MI) in ischaemic heart disease, where specific and sensitive diagnostic toolkits including biomarkers, imaging and interventions have revolutionised care pathways and patient outcomes. Such disparity in advancement raises the question of why COPD is so far behind other common, debilitating and progressive chronic diseases which are associated with acute flares of symptoms. Why do we not have a better diagnostic and treatment toolkit for ECOPD? Perhaps to move forward, we need to examine the past.",

Viruses were found in 48%, with rhinoviruses, influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial viruses, parainfluenza viruses and coronaviruses most commonly identified, again in descending order of prevalence.16 Viral infections are important in COPD, associated with frequent exacerbations, a higher total symptom burden at presentation and a longer period before symptom recovery,17 perhaps reflecting the lack of specific therapies available. Coinfection (bacterial and viral) is common (seen in 25% of severe exacerbations), associated with increased lung and systemic inflammation, longer hospitalisation and more severe lung disease.16 The role of air quality is of increasing interest. Short-term exposure to major air pollutants (trioxygen (O3), carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, particulate matter (PM)10 and PM2.5) is associated with respiratory risk but a recent systematic review concluded that these pollutants were also associated with risk of exacerbation.18 Other identified triggers and/or risk factors for exacerbation include discontinuation and poor adherence with medications,19 poor nutritional and lower socioeconomic status20 and dynamic hyperinflation.21 These causative triggers and predisposing factors have been consistently identified across the literature, but studies also highlight alternative pathologies which might account for symptoms, including thromboembolic disease and MI (identified in 16%22 and 8%23 of suspected COPD exacerbations, respectively), suggesting comorbidity is important.",

However, there are concerns about the ability of patients to self-report sputum colour without training or a colour chart to refer to Daniels et al\n25 and in some studies, sputum colour could not differentiate between a viral or bacterial aetiology.16 A landmark study in 201126 suggested that exacerbations could be stratified using inflammatory profile. Here, 55% of exacerbations were associated with bacteria, 29% with a virus, most commonly rhinovirus, 28% with a significant sputum eosinophilia and 14% with no significant inflammation (termed pauci-inflammatory). Of note, these groupings did not reflect differences in symptom burden, clinical presentation or sputum colour, which could not differentiate between causes,26 meaning clinicians could not predict what the cause or inflammatory profile of the exacerbation was using standard clinical evaluation alone. This has important but perhaps predictable implications for clinical practice. Moving forward, as with other acute presentations of chronic disease, we should not rely on clinical symptoms, signs or non-specific investigations to direct a stratified approach to exacerbation treatment. Given COPD is an inflammatory disease, the immune response may provide aetiological insight.",

Once an insult (bacterial, viral or environmental) sufficiently activates the resident immune cells of the airways, it appears to trigger a cascade of inflammatory mediators.31 This in turn recruits a wave of activated immune cells to the airways, which are predominantly neutrophils16 but also include eosinophils, monocytes and CD8 +T cells32\n33 and these cells have the potential to cause significant disruption and damage when they enter tissue en masse. For example, activated neutrophils release proteinases during migration through complex tissues, degranulation, frustrated phagocytosis and Neutrophil extracellular traps (NET) formation.34 The concentration of proteinases initially far exceed and thus overwhelm their inhibitors leading to degradation of structural lung proteins including elastin and collagen causing bystander tissue damage and cleavage of enzymes, cytokines, receptors and opsonins including components of the complement cascade and immunoglobulins.35 36 While tissue damage is heightened in exacerbations of COPD, tissue repair is blunted, effecting the structural integrity of the airways.37 This inflammatory cascade also results in systemic inflammation, with increases in acute phase proteins such as fibrinogen and C reactive protein (CRP). Relationships have been described between the degree of pulmonary and systemic inflammation in some studies,38 a potential link between the multimorbid diseases associated with COPD and COPD exacerbations (see later). These processes are illustrated in figure 2.",

It has been proposed that some frequently exacerbating COPD patients might experience a \u2018triple innate immune system hit\u2019 which could increase their susceptibility to bacterial exacerbations. First, the frequent exacerbator phenotype has been associated with a reduced ability of airway macrophages to phagocytose bacteria.43 Theoretically, this would lead to increased neutrophil recruitment and in this group neutrophilic inflammation is commonly described.31 Second, studies suggest the accuracy of neutrophil targeting is impaired in COPD and associated with heightened bystander tissue damage.44 Third, airway macrophages and monocytes from the frequent exacerbator phenotype are less able to clear dead and dying neutrophils (and eosinophils45 via efferocytosis,46 resulting in cell necrosis and localised inflammation and tissue damage). Neutrophilic inflammation is corticosteroid resistant in COPD but promisingly, studies have identified potential therapeutic targets to improve impaired cellular functions. NrF2 activators increase macrophage phagocytosis46 and PI3K inhibitors have been shown to increase neutrophil migratory accuracy in vitro as well as reducing inflammation47 with PI3K inhibitors under assessment in early phase studies as a potential therapy during COPD exacerbations.",

Such insults include the aetiological factor itself (pathogen or environmental), lung physiological changes and additional work of breathing, hypoxia, periods of inactivity (which can effectively be prolonged periods of \u2018bed rest\u2019 during an in-patient admission), with a study suggesting that an acute medical admission is associated with a median step count of 626 per day (IQR 266\u20131403),66 dehydration, malnutrition, the therapies prescribed and their side effects (eg, oral corticosteroids and hyperglycaemia and antibiotics and gastrointestinal disturbance) and then the sequelae of these factors including systemic inflammation, hypo and hypernatraemia/kalaemia and altered sympathetic drive. Figure 3 summarises the complex relationships between comorbidity and exacerbations in COPD. There is a significant and complex interplay between the exacerbation and the comorbid condition including the impact of comorbidities on the exacerbation itself; how an exacerbation contributes to comorbid disease; the prognostic role of comorbid disease and the subclinical presentation of a comorbid condition at the time of an exacerbation.

However, the placebo response rate was high, likely reflecting viral pathogens as a common cause of exacerbation, and more recent studies have not shown a benefit of antibiotics in other outcomes such as prolonging the time to next exacerbation.98 Biomarkers such as sputum colour and procalcitonin99 have been suggested as strategies to better guide antibiotic therapy, but there remains unmet need to better define which exacerbations do and do not benefit from antibiotic therapy. It is also notable that there are no effective interventions to treat (or prevent) rhinovirus infections, thought to be the single the most common cause of a COPD exacerbation.",

For patients remaining hypercapnic following a hospitalised exacerbation, domiciliary non-invasive ventilation significantly reduces the risk of rehospitalisation (with an absolute risk reduction of 17% in a recent landmark study).103 Similar to strategies to better target exacerbation treatment, there is also now emerging evidence on how better to target exacerbation prevention interventions, including the optimal use of inhaled corticosteroids. Thus, while exacerbation prevention strategies are incompletely effective, the challenge here is rather selecting the right combination of interventions for the right patient at the right time, rather than the absence of effective prevention strategies.",
