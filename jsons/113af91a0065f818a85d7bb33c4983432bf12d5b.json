However, several safety concerns have been raised from chloroquine use due to the lack of essential information regarding its dosing. The aim of this study is to provide a critical appraisal of the safety information regarding chloroquine treatment and to apply simulation techniques to unveil relationships between the observed serious adverse events and overdosing, as well as to propose optimized dosage regimens. The dose related adverse events of chloroquine are unveiled and maximum tolerated doses and concentration levels are quoted. Among others, treatment with chloroquine can lead to severe adverse effects like prolongation of the QT interval and cardiomyopathy. In case of chloroquine overdosing, conditions similar to those produced by SARS-CoV2, such as pulmonary oedema with respiratory insufficiency and circulatory collapse, can be observed. Coadministration of chloroquine with other drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, like azithromycin, can further increase the risk of QT prolongation and cardiomyopathy. For elder patients there is a high risk for toxicity and dose reduction should be made. This study unveils the risks of some widely used dosing regimens and binds the observed serious adverse events with dosing. Based on simulations, safer alternative dosage regimens are proposed and recommendations regarding chloroquine dosing are made.",

Patients with Coronavirus Disease-2019 are currently millions, while a portion around 15% of them contracts the severe form of the disease (Cortegiani et al., 2020) . Since currently there is no specific medicinal treatment, existing medicines used to treat other diseases are administered and tested in COVID-19 patients in the light of drug repositioning. In this context, chloroquine (CQ) is widely used in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection since it can decrease the length of hospital stay and improve the evolution of the associated pneumonia (Colson et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2020) .",

It is worth mentioning that CQ apart from its antimalarial efficacy, exerts also anti-inflammatory and direct antiviral effects against retroviruses, flaviviruses, HIV, Zika virus, and coronaviruses (Savarino et al., 2003; Delvecchio et al., 2016) . CQ interferes with the glycosylation of the SARS-CoV2 cellular receptors and also alters the endosomal pH needed for virus-cell fusion (Avdic, 2020) . CQ inhibits the attachment of viruses to the human respiratory cells, which is facilitated by the spike SARS-CoV2 protein (Fantini et al., 2020) . The immunomodulant effects are mediated by the reduction in T cell activation and differentiation, and suppression of cytokines produced by B-and T-lymphocytes (such as IL-1, IL-6) which are elevated in the body inflammatory response against the viruses (Avdic, 2020). The first intimations of the possible CQ effect on SARS viruses were proposed as early as in 2003 (Savarino et al., 2003) . A common characteristic of the COVID-19 patients is the probability of a clinical worsening in the second week of infection which cannot be directly attributed to SARS-CoV2, but it might be linked to an immunological response. Thus, both the anti-inflammatory and the direct antiviral properties of CQ make it capable of treating COVID-19 (Cortegiani et al., 2020) . Currently, CQ is fully considered for controlling the late phase cytokine storm occurring in COVID-19 patients and the US FDA has released on March 28, 2020 an emergency use authorization for CQ to treat COVID-19 patients (Bright, 2020) .",

A serious condition is prolongation of the QT interval, with a potential to induce cardiac arrhythmias especially after long-term treatment (Avloclor \u00ae SmPC, 2016). The extent of QT prolongation can increase with high doses. Cardiomyopathy is another serious incident that might occur with CQ treatment leading to heart failure, with sometimes fatal outcome (Chatre et al., 2018) . Again, high CQ plasma levels and long-term therapy are risk factors for cardiomyopathy. It should be underlined that the risk of QT prolongation and cardiomyopathy are highly increased after co-administration with azithromycin and warnings have already imposed by the FDA (Svanstr\u00f6m et al., 2013; Ray et al., 2012; Mosholder et al., 2013; FDA, 2013) . In addition, the CQ-azithromycin combination with fluoroquinolones (moxifloxacin, levofloxacin) is definitely cardiotoxic and should be avoided (Svanstr\u00f6m et al., 2013; Ray et al., 2012; Mosholder et al., 2013; FDA, 2013) . Diffuse parenchymal lung disease can appear to a small portion of patients, while respiratory failure and subsequent death can occur at high doses. Severe hypoglycemia, with the accompanying symptoms like loss of consciousness, can be life threatening for the patients treated with CQ and therefore they should have their blood glucose levels monitored closely. Eye/vision disorders can appear usually after long term CQ treatment, whereas when total CQ intake exceeds 1.6 g/kg, corneal changes and retinal damage can be irreversible. Some COVID-19 patients complaint also for symptoms like dizziness, drowsiness, headache, blurred vision, diplopia, increased excitability, and convulsions which typically can occur at higher CQ doses. In addition, there are complaints from patients for symptoms like involuntary movements of the tongue, tonic muscular spasms, dystonia (namely, extrapyramidal symptoms), which can be a result from CQ treatment. Myasthenia type symptoms and liver disorders can also happen and many patients now suffer from them. It has to be highlighted that patients with G6PD deficiency should take CQ with special caution due to the risk of hemolysis.",

Mild to moderate CQ overdose leads to nausea and vomiting, hypokalemia, metabolic acidosis, neuropsychiatric side effects, headache, and visual disturbances (e.g. blindness). Severe overdose can result in patient convulsions, depressed myocardial contractility, cardiac arrhythmias (however, correction with anti-arrhythmic drugs like those with quinidine-like effect should be avoided), severe hypokalemia, shock, and finally death through respiratory and circulatory collapse. Therapeutic treatments of CQ overdosing include early administration of adrenaline (to restore systolic blood pressure) and diazepam administration (to reduce CQ induced cardiotoxicity). Since CQ is eliminated from the body after several weeks/months, due to extended distribution to peripheral tissues, caution is needed to avoid overdosage. Hemodialysis or other types of dialysis (e.g. peritoneal dialysis) do not appear to exert benefit. Lethal doses result in pulmonary oedema, subsequent respiratory insufficiency and finally death regardless the existence of mechanical ventilation and other treatment (Ursing, 2009; Ndiaye, 1999) . In adults, the lethal dose is estimated between 30-50 mg/kg, while doses higher than 20mg/kg can also be toxic (Olson, 2004) . Doses of more than 40mg/kg are lethal if no early intensive treatment is made.",

Antacids and acidic beverages can reduce absorption, while food increases bioavailability (and also reduces nausea/vomiting). A portion of 50-65% CQ is bound to plasma proteins, while the volume of distribution can be very high (up to 800 l/kg) indicating the extensive CQ distribution in peripheral tissues like lungs, eyes, heart, liver, kidneys, and brain. Due to its extensive distribution, the elimination half-life of CQ ranges from 20 to 60 days. Elimination occurs due to renal clearance and metabolism (in an almost equal proportion). The CQ kinetics have been found to be linear over the dose range 2-15mg/kg (of CQ base).",

However, for elder patients, special concerns are raised, because it more likely to have kidney and/or liver problems and dose adjustment might be needed to avoid CQ accumulation (Mayo clinic, 2020). In the subsequent analysis performed in this study, the impact of renal/liver impairment on the rise of concentration levels is revealed. In case of children, despite the fact that they exhibit higher clearance values than adults, children appear more sensitive to the effects of CQ (Zhao et al., 2014; Avloclor\u00ae SmPC, 2016; Mayo clinic, 2020) . Pregnant women are advised to avoid CQ, since high CQ doses can lead to fetal abnormalities like ototoxicity, cochlear dysfunction, and visual loss (Avloclor \u00ae SmPC, 2016). However, depending on the judgment of the physician the potential benefit can outweigh risk. Reported results on the safety of CQ during pregnancy reveal that CQ can be safe even after a relatively high dosage of 500mg/day (Klinger et al., 2001) . CQ is excreted in breast milk at around 2.8%, a portion which is inadequate for infant chemoprophylaxis, but it may cause disorders (even though it is considered low to be harmful). The physician should weigh the therapeutic benefit against potential risk for the infant. However, adequate studies are missing (Avdic, 2020; Avloclor \u00ae SmPC, 2016; Mayo clinic, 2020). Finally, is should be kept in mind that CQ is metabolized by CYP2D6, an enzyme system with variable expression among individuals. For example, 7% of North Americans are poor CYP2D6 metabolizers, while a portion 1-2% of them are ultra-rapid metabolizers (Juurlink, 2020) . Since, genetic variability, can significantly alter CQ levels (and therefore efficacy/safety profile), it has to be taken into account where possible.",

For adults, all proposed models were quite similar and their differences refer to the use either of lag-time during absorption, or a transition compartment. For the simulations performed in this study, the selected model refers to a two-compartment model, with absorption lag time and first order kinetics for all transfers (absorption, elimination, inter-compartmental) (Zhao et al., 2014) . In the literature models, body weight was found to be a significant covariate for volumes of distribution and clearances. For the volume of distribution of the central and peripheral compartment an allometric exponent of 1 was used, while for clearance and inter-compartmental clearance an allometric exponent of 0.75 was utilized (Zhao et al., 2014) . The reference patient of the study was considered to be: 70kg, 40 years old, with body mass index 15kg/m 2 , and body surface area of 1.73m 2 . Other situations like patients with different weights and altered renal/liver function were also simulated.

Special focus was placed on performing simulations towards answering several questions imposed by the physicians like the time needed to achieve steady state levels of CQ, the residence time in the body after stopping administration, the conditions of early initiation of therapy, the effect of patients' body weight, the frequency of daily administrations, and finally the impact of impaired renal and/or liver impairment.

The differences among them can only be attributed to the time needed to reach steady state levels, where the dosing scenarios with loading doses (scenarios \"3\", \"4\", \"5\" of Table 1 ) achieve earlier plateau levels. The 500mg x2 scheme lead to plasma concentrations very close to the reported toxic levels of 800ng/ml and therefore a high toxicity risk exists. Obviously, a patient with impaired clearance would face an even higher risk due to the higher plasma levels. Another worth notable finding is the fact that large fluctuations can be observed at steady state. The impact of these fluctuations can be two-fold: a) sometimes sub-therapeutic levels may exist and b) the steep increases in the concentration might trigger adverse events by themselves (Ursing, 2009 ).",

Table 1 (scenario \"1\" vs. scenario \"3\" vs. scenario \"5\"), D. 500mg once daily vs. 250mg twice daily. Figure 2A reveals that the time needed to reach steady state levels is almost two weeks, irrespectively of the dosing regimen (for example, 500mg once or twice daily). A finding which can be attributed to the long half-life of CQ. Secondly, as it is expected from the linear CQ kinetics, the levels achieved after the 500mg x 2 dose is twice as those occurring from the once daily 500mg dose. In addition, Fig2A reveals the long time required for CQ to be removed from the body after its withdrawal. Figure 2B presents the hypothetical concentration of CQ achieved in the peripheral tissues. It is called \"hypothetical\" since it is assumed that outside plasma the CQ concentration is everywhere the same. Even though, this is not completely true, however, Fig2B offers us the opportunity to realize that much more time is needed to reach saturation with drug in the peripheral tissues than that observed in plasma. Indeed, even after two weeks of continuous treatment, and although steady state levels are achieved in plasma, the concentration of CQ in tissues still rises and no saturation has occurred. This finding has also a significant impact on the observed CQ disappearance from plasma, since it explains why drug decay is so slow and why adverse events can be observed after withdrawal from CQ treatment.",

It becomes obvious that the use of loading doses, allows much earlier achievement of steady state levels. At first sight, this leads to the conclusion that the use of loading doses is favorable. However, this is only true in a pharmacokinetic point of view and not in terms of safety, since literature data reveal that steep increases of CQ levels can result in adverse/toxic effects (Ursing, 2009) . Therefore, the practice of using loading doses of CQ should be considered very carefully due to the high risk of toxic effects. Finally, Fig.2D compares the frequency of two dosage regimens and in particular the 500mg x 1 versus 250mg x2 daily. As it is expected, due to the linearity of CQ pharmacokinetics and the fact that in both cases the same total daily amount is used, both schemes lead to the same average concentration values at steady state. However, much less fluctuations are observed in case of the twice daily regimen. Bearing in mind the higher risk of toxic effects due to CQ concentrations changes, the use of more frequent regimens appears to be more favorable.",

In Fig.3 the evaluation of additional regimens starts with the simulation of the milder (i.e. new1) scenario and goes gradually to more severe regimens with loading doses and larger total doses in general (e.g. scenario \"new4\"). The addition of each new dosing scheme is made in subsequent plots in order to allow the reader to identify it easier. As it is expected, increasing the \"severity\" of dosing scenario higher concentrations are achieved, but in a different way. It is worth mentioning that the already proposed scenario \"3\" of Table 1 results in very steep increases during the first day of the treatment, while from the second day the achieved levels are almost equivalent to those from the scenarios \"new2\" and \"new3\". Bearing in mind that steep increases can be harmful, it is proposed that in case of need, scenarios \"new2\" and \"new3\" should be chosen instead of the existing scenario \"3\". If the physician decides for even higher CQ levels, then the \"new4\" scenario can be used, since it leads to high concentration levels in a mild way, namely, avoiding steep increases. It is interesting to note some additional characteristics of the \"new4\" scenario which is considered as the most aggressive of all the \"new\" scenarios: a) the use of a total dose of 1,250mg (i.e. 500+500+250) the first day is in accordance with the maximum safe dose of 20mg/kg outlined above, b) It achieves higher concentrations than the existing scenario \"3\" and lower than the typical case of scenario \"1\" (500mg x 2), c) The initial concentration increases are milder than scenario 3, since the total daily dose is split into three doses (instead of two). These features make scenarios \"new3\" and \"new4\" safer dosing alternative for the treatment of severe COVID-19 patients, whereas scenarios \"new1\" and \"new2\" can be used in patients with mild-moderate symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia.

In this case, the situation of a patient who starts CQ treatment early after the development of first symptoms is simulated. This patient is considered to start CQ at low dose (250mg x 2) immediately and is compared to other patients who start treatment three days later. Visual observation of Fig.4 clearly reveals that the patient who initiated early CQ treatment exhibits the same plateau levels after three days with patients started later, but using much more aggressive regimens. In particular, in the early initiation patient only a low dose of 250mg x 2 is given, compared to the much higher doses of 500mg x2 (scenario 1: red line) and the scheme with the loading dose (scenario 3: green line). In other words, the early initiation of treatment with low doses, offers several advantages such as the achievement of the desired levels in a nonaggressive way, avoidance of steep concentration increases and subsequent toxicities, cover the patient with low CQ doses which are rather safe, whereas depending on patient's condition the dosing scheme can be increased. Even though, chemoprophylaxis against SARS-CoV2 using chloroquine is another issue, these results indicate the benefits of low dose CQ administration in terms of safety and its subsequent clinical implications. However, other studies are required to unveil the potential role of CQ in chemoprophylaxis against SARS-CoV2. Figure 4 .

Figure 5A shows the achieved levels after 500mg x 2 administration for ten days in three different subjects: the typical case of 70kg, a heavier adult weighting 100kg, and a lighter of 50kg. Since weight was found to affect clearances and volumes of distribution (see 'Methods'), the increase of body weight results in lower plasma levels. On the contrary, for low body weight individuals, administration of the typically used now 500mg x 2 regimen can lead to concentrations above the toxic levels of 800ng/ml (Furst, 1996) . Besides, even for the case of typical patient of 70kg, the observed levels are close to this toxic value increasing the risk for adverse events. These findings clearly indicate the high toxicity risk associated with the currently applied dosing scheme. The impact of reduced clearance (e.g. in the elderly) is also depicted in Fig.5B . It becomes evident that even a 30% decrease can lead to levels exceeding the toxic limit of 800ng/ml for the typical 500mg x2 dosing scheme. Much more pronounced is the impact of higher impairment (i.e. 50%) leading to very high concentrations with a definite toxic impact. However, when a lower total dose is administered, as in case of a 250mg x 2 scheme, approximation of toxic levels is avoided even after 10 days treatment (Fig.5C ).",

For example, 250mg twice daily is better than 500mg once daily, due to lower fluctuations and lower risk of adverse events from steep concentration increases \uf0b7 Treatment should be initiated as early as possible using the less aggressive dose regimens In order to avoid complexity of the proposed dosing schemes, it was attempted to organize them (Table 3) in the simplest possible way, but at the meantime to cover special patients' needs. Severe Adults a Patients weighting more than 50% from the average (70kg), require 25% higher doses b Patients weighting less than 50% from the average (70kg), require 25% lower doses Thus, the physicians considering the severity of COVID-19 related pneumonia and taking into account the abovementioned factors can select the appropriate dosing regimen for their patient.",

The fact that many COVID-19 patients face clinical conditions similar to those triggered by chloroquine overdosing (like pulmonary oedema, respiratory insufficiency, and circulatory collapse) underlines the necessity of appropriate dosing. Even though, clinical trials and everyday clinical practice should be performed to confirm the appropriate dosage regimens, modeling and simulation approaches can provide early recommendations for dosing. This study attempts to unveil the toxicity risks of some widely used dosage schemes and binds the observed serious adverse events with dosing. It also proposes safer dosage regimens tailored to patients' characteristics (e.g. body weight, age) and the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia. Finally, it is suggested early chloroquine therapy initiation at low doses, upon the first symptoms, as a safe dosing alternative in high risk patients.",
