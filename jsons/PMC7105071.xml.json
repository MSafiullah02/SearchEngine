The NHI system covers a wide range of outpatient and inpatient services and allows the people in Taiwan to have access to comprehensive medical care. However, the introduction of the system has also increased the numbers of bedridden patients with long-term use of invasive medical devices and procedures. This leads to an increased risk of acquiring HAI.8, 9 Moreover, there are two other major challenges, including an increase in average life expectancy and the growth of the elderly population, putting the population at large at risk of infection. Furthermore, frequent international travel also facilitates HAI across national borders, posing a serious threat to the public. In the future, the Taiwan CDC will continue to work with stakeholders to promote and execute infection control strategies in order to achieve our ultimate goal of zero tolerance to HAI.10\n",
