            "text": "RNA interference (RNAi) is a\nposttranscriptional mechanism of gene silencing highly conserved in\neukaryotes. RNAi controls gene expression by interaction of complementary\nsequences between a target mRNA and a single stranded molecule of RNA:\nsmall interference (siRNA) or micro-RNA (miRNA). siRNA binds the target\nmRNA with a perfect complementarity. Instead, miRNA shows a partial\nmatching, generally, with the 3\u2032UTR of target mRNA. The interaction\nbetween the small RNA and the target results in gene silencing when the\nsiRNA or the miRNA is bound to the RNA-induced silencing complex RISC.\nThus, RISC is guided to the target mRNA by the small RNA. Binding to the\ntarget with perfect complementarity induces RISC-mediated cleavage of the\ntarget RNA. miRNA guiding of RISC induces gene silencing by an as yet not\nfully understood mechanism that leads to translational repression and\ndeadenylation and degradation of mRNA targets [1].",

In fact, processing\nof most of the viral pre-mRNAs from both the early and the late phase\nrequires proper alternative splicing and polyadenylation. Furthermore,\nalternative splicing of some of the pre-mRNAs differs throughout the\nviral cycle (Fig. 1A).

            "text": "Cellular splicing factors are modified during\nthe viral infection so that adequate alternative splicing of viral\ntranscripts can occur. However, these changes have a negative impact on\nthe alternative splicing of cellular pre-mRNAs. In fact, several cellular\npathways are affected during the adenovirus cell-cycle. DNA repair\nenzymes are inactivated to avoid the concatemerization of the adenoviral\ngenome [27]. The interferon\n(IFN) pathway is blocked to impede the host antiviral response by\naffecting several key molecules [28]. Furthermore, cellular mRNA transport to the\ncytoplasm is repressed while transport of adenoviral RNA is not\n[29]. In the cytoplasm,\ntranslation of cellular mRNAs is also inhibited, so adenoviral mRNAs are\npreferentially translated [30]. Finally, several essential proteins of the RNAi\nsilencing pathway are blocked or saturated during adenoviral infection.\nSince some mammalian viruses are inhibited by host-derived siRNA or miRNA\n[31], this RNAi-blocking\nstrategy could enhance infection. Like adenovirus, other mammalian\nviruses have evolved ways to block the RNAi pathway which include\nexpression of proteins such as primate foamy virus-1 Tas [31], HIV Tat [32], influenza virus NS1 [33], [34], vaccinia virus E3L\n[34], HCV core\n[35], ebola virus VP35,\nVP30 and VP40 [36], [37], HTLV Rex [38] or coronavirus 7a accessory protein [39]. Moreover, certain viral RNAs also\nhave the ability to inhibit the silencing pathway. A good example is TAR\nRNA, expressed by HIV-1 virus, which binds and sequesters the\nhost-derived TAR RNA binding protein (TRBP), a necessary cofactor for\nDicer function [40]. Another\nexample is adenovirus virus-associated (VA) RNAs [41], [42] reviewed here.",

            "text": "Early observations showed that protein\nsynthesis is decreased in cells infected with adenovirus lacking\nVAI as compared to wild type adenovirus, suggesting an active role\nof VAI in promoting translation [54]. This effect was associated with the\nphosphorylation of the \u03b1-subunit of the eukaryotic translation\ninitiation factor 2 (eIF2\u03b1) [58], [59]. When eIF2\u03b1 is phosphorylated, it has\nincreased affinity for the eIF-2 subunit \u03b2, which prevents\nrecharging of the initiation complex with GTP and results in\ntranslational inhibition. Later, protein kinase R (PKR) was\nidentified as the kinase responsible for eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation and\nthe subsequent arrest in translation [56], [60]. Induced by\ninterferon, PKR is a serine-threonine kinase that becomes activated\nby dsRNA, a common intermediate of viral replication, and acts as a\nmajor component of the cellular anti-viral pathway. It is through\nthe inhibition of PKR that VAI eliminates the block in the\ntranslational machinery and thus allows the efficient production of\nviral proteins. As previously described, VA RNA structure can be\ndivided into three major domains: apical stem, central domain and\nterminal domain (Fig. 1B). The apical stem\u2013loop is required for\nbinding to PKR and the central domain is involved in the inhibition\nof PKR activation [28], [46], [47], [48], [49], [61]. The terminal stem is not\ndirectly involved in PKR inhibition, but is essential for binding\nto Exp 5, which mediates VA transport from the nucleus to the\ncytoplasm, where PKR is localized [62].",

VA RNAs are transcribed by RNA\npolymerase III in the nucleus of infected cells [45]. VAI synthesis starts during\nthe early phase of infection and rapidly accelerates during late\nphase. As a result, VAI molecules accumulate to very high level\n(108 molecules/cell) [63], [64]. VAII is also\nsynthesized at high levels in the late phase but accumulates at\nlower concentration than VAI (107\nmolecules/cell). This lower expression is not surprising since VAI\npromoter is stronger than VAII promoter. In fact VAI and VAII are\nexpressed to similar levels when both VA genes are placed under the\nsame promoter [41]. On\nthe other hand, VAII can increase its concentration when VAI is not\ntranscribed suggesting transcriptional competition between both\nRNAs [55]. VA RNA\ntranscription initiation is under the control of two internal\nregions named box A and box B. Transcriptional termination occurs\nin an A-rich region that is copied into a terminal U-tail on the\nviral transcripts [65].\nThese regions are highly conserved across several\nserotypes.",

Dicer is an RNase capable of processing stem\u2013loop\ndsRNAs such as shRNAs or pre-miRNAs, into siRNAs or miRNAs, respectively.\nDicer recognizes free ends and cuts the duplex at a distance of\napproximately 22 nucleotides [66]. Therefore, it was not unexpected to find that VA\nRNAs are processed by Dicer into smaller dsRNAs named mivaRNAs\n[41], [67], [68], [69]. VA RNA processing has been described\nin vitro but also in\nvivo, in cells that express VA RNAs after transfection or\nadenoviral infection. Both VAI and VAII are processed, but the VAII\nprocessed fragment is more difficult to detect, perhaps due to the lower\nexpression levels of VAII RNA [41]. Only the terminal stem of VA RNA is processed\nwhile the apical stem is not affected. The efficiency of Dicer cleavage\nis mainly determined from the 3\u2032 end of the stem, but the length of the\nstem and the interaction with the loop also influence Dicer activity. VA\nstructure has a long stem and a large bulge that could negatively affect\nDicer processing of VA RNAs. In fact, VA RNA processing by Dicer is not\nvery efficient, since only 2-5% of the total VAI RNA is cleaved\n[67]. As a result, most of\nthe VAI in the cell is full-length and only a minor amount is processed\ninto mivaRNA. The larger piece that remains after Dicer processing is not\ndetectable, probably because it is unstable. Given that there are\n108 molecules of VAI per infected cell,\nDicer processing generates over 106 molecules\nof mivaRNAs/cell. Not only are mivaRNAs abundant, but they are also\nfunctional. They can bind the RISC complex and inhibit the expression of\nluciferase reporter genes with complementary sequences in\nvivo and in vitro\n[41], [67]. This is\nobserved in cells transfected with a plasmid that expresses the VA RNAs\nor in adenovirus-infected cells [67]. mivaRNAs can also decrease the expression of\nreporter genes whose targets lack perfect complementarity with the\nmivaRNA, so they can function as miRNAs [68]. Similar to adenoviral VA RNAs, HIV-1 TAR RNA is\nalso inefficiently processed by Dicer to yield viral miRNAs that inhibit\nthe expression of genes with complementary sequences [70], [71], [72], [73].\nTAR-derived miRNAs target cellular genes to protect the infected cell\nfrom apoptosis [73]. In HIV-1\ninfected cells, small RNAs have also been described that contain\nsequences from HIV-1 NEF or Rev Response Element (RRE), or sequences\ncomplementary to the primer binding site [71]. The latter small RNA has been shown to bind\nRISC, control the expression of reporter constructs and modulate HIV\nreplication.",

            "text": "Similar to the miRNAs derived from HIV-1\ngenome, the sequence of the mivaRNAs has been deciphered using several\ntechnologies: primer extension combined with Northern-blot analysis,\nanalysis of target cleavage products, S1 mapping, and sequencing of small\nRNAs [41], [67], [68], [69]. The latter technique has generated\nunexpected results. According to sequencing results, the most abundant\nmivaRNA sequences derive from the 3\u2032 end of VAI and VAII and they were\nnamed after their starting position. mivaRI-137 and mivaRI-138 are\nprocessed from VAI, and mivaRII-138 is processed from VAII [69]. mivaRNAs were also detected from\nthe 5\u2032 end of VAI but they accumulate to much lower levels than those of\nthe 3\u2032 end. Furthermore, mivaRNAs from the 5\u2032 end are incorporated into\nRISC with lower efficiencies, but they form RISC complexes with good\nstability [74]. Cloning and\nsequencing of cytoplasmic small RNAs in infected cells showed that the\namount of small RNAs derived from VAII was twice the amount of those\nderived from VAI [69]. Since\nthe amount of VAII is 1/20 lower than that of VAI, this result suggests\nthat VAII could be preferentially processed by Dicer. Cloning and\nsequencing of Ago2 bound miRNAs in adenovirus-infected cells showed that\nthe largest proportion derive from VAII RNA [69]. 60% of the small RNAs bound to Ago2 derived from\nVAII RNA while only 20% derived from VAI. This suggests that VAII\nmivaRNAs could be preferentially bound to Ago2. Furthermore, only 10% of\nthe RNAs bound to Ago2 are cellular miRNAs in adenovirus-infected cells,\ncompared to more than 50% in mock infected cells. These results suggest\nthat Ago2, and probably the other cellular Agos, are saturated with viral\nmivaRNAs. This could explain reduced RISC efficiency in infected cells.\nThus, the reduction in RISC effectiveness is not due to a specific\ninhibition of the enzymatic complex, but likely due to a saturation of\nRISC with mivaRNAs. By sheer numbers, mivaRNAs would outcompete cellular\nmiRNAs, leading to a reduction in miRNA incorporation into RISC. In\nsummary, inhibition of the RNAi pathway by adenoviral VAs can be defined\nas the result of a progressive saturation of critical enzymes of the RNAi\nmachinery, including Ago2, Exp5, and Dicer, which induces a competitive\ndisplacement of cellular RNAi precursors.",

Bioinformatic analysis of the viral genome\nrevealed no potential targets in the adenovirus genome [67], excluding regulation of viral gene\nexpression by their own small RNAs as observed in other viruses such as\nSV40, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, or Herpes Simplex virus type I [14]. In fact, the nucleotide sequence\ncomplementary to the target binding seed sequence of major mivaRNAs is\nunderrepresented in the adenovirus genome, suggesting that the virus has\nevolved to avoid expression control by mivaRNAs. To identify potential\ncellular targets of mivaRNAs, genomic and bioinformatic studies were\nperformed [75]. It is known\nthat miRNAs induce mRNA decay, leading to reduced accumulation of target\nmRNAs. Therefore, the expression pattern of cells expressing VAI and VAII\nwas analyzed by microarray. This analysis allowed the identification of\n462 downregulated mRNAs and 637 upregulated mRNAs after VA RNA\nexpression. Genes activated by NF\u03ba\u03b2, including the inflammatory cytokines\ninterleukin-6 (IL6) and IL1, were particularly abundant among upregulated\nmRNAs. This may result from VA RNA activation of cytoplasmic dsRNA-sensor\nRIG-I, a well-known IFN inducer [76], [77]. Functional analysis of downregulated genes\nindicated that 10% were related to RNA metabolism, splicing or\ntranslation or encoded RNA-binding proteins. The reason for this is\nunclear. We speculate that expression of proteins that process or bind\ncellular RNA could be detrimental for adenoviral RNA and VA RNA could\ndownregulate the expression of genes that encode for RNA binding proteins\nby an unknown mechanism.",

It is important to notice that only one\nnucleotide difference in Dicer processing yields mivaRI-137 and\nmivaRI-138 which contain different seed sequences and consequently can\nbind different targets. Out of the 462 genes downregulated by expression\nof VA RNAs, 305 contained in their 3\u2032 UTR a putative target of the\nabundant mivaRNAs. Fifty of these were studied in more detail. They were\nnot chosen randomly: 22 had good target sites for mivaRI-138, 4 for\nmivaRI-137, 12 for mivaRII-138 and 12 were relevant genes of known\nfunction. Adequate quantitative RT-PCR amplification was obtained for 48\nof these genes, and their mRNA levels were studied in cells expressing VA\nRNAs after plasmid transfection or at different time-points after viral\ninfection. Out of the 48 characterized genes, 30 of them were\ndownregulated in infected or transfected VA RNA expressing cells. If the\nnumbers could be scaled up linearly, out of 305 downregulated genes in\nthe array, as many as 190 cellular genes could be targeted by abundant\nadenoviral miRNAs. Inhibitions were normally higher in infected cells\nthan in cells transfected with plasmids that express VA RNAs, VAI RNA or\nmivaRI-138. This could reflect the fact that mivaRNAs levels in infected\ncells, being higher, saturate the RISC machinery so the complex could be\nmore efficient in silencing mivaRNA target genes. Alternatively, other\nmechanisms related to viral infection could potentiate the efficacy of\nthe RISC complex. In fact, eight genes were downregulated in\nVA-expressing transfected cells but not in cells infected with wild-type\nadenovirus, indicating that they could escape mivaRNA control during\ninfection. Out of the 38 genes regulated by VA RNA, all were decreased by\nexpression of VAI RNA and 31 respond to mivaRI-138 [75]. This was unexpected as Ago is\nbound preferentially to mivaRII-138 [69]. Also, since overexpression of adenoviral\nmivaRNAs should saturate RISC, increased levels of RISC-controlled genes\nmight have been expected. However, there was no upregulation of\nwell-characterized miRNA targets. It may be that under our experimental\nconditions viral miRNA production was not high enough to saturate RISC or\ndid not lead to production of high levels of mivaRII-138.",

Furthermore, TIA-1 is\nessential for the formation of cytoplasmic stress granules [81] associated with several cellular\nstresses, including viral infections. Stress granules would act as mRNA\nhijackers that induce translational arrest. A decrease in TIA-1 levels\nwould inhibit, at least in part, the formation of stress granules, and\nwould overcome the translational arrest that may block viral growth\n[82], [83], [84].\nFinally, TIA-1 binds to U-rich sequences in mRNAs to increase splicing or\nto block translation [78], [79], [85]. Most adenoviral transcripts have U-rich\nstretches that could allow TIA-1 binding. E1a pre-mRNA has several U-rich\nsequences located in regions that can be alternatively spliced\n(Fig. 1A). In fact,\noverexpression of TIA-1 changes the alternative splicing of E1a and leads\nto increased E1a levels (Aparicio et al., unpublished results). Thus, a\nnegative loop of regulation may be in action. At early times of infection\nTIA-1 levels are generally high and could help to increase E1a\nexpression. Then, E1a would activate transcription of VA RNAs that are\nprocessed to mivaRNAs. Subsequently, mivaRI-138 would downregulate TIA-1\nleading to decreased E1a levels and to a different alternative splicing\nof E1a mRNAs at late times post-infection. Thus mivaRI-138 downregulation\nof TIA-1 could contribute to the shift between the early and the late\nphases of adenovirus infection.",

            "text": "Adenoviruses have been widely used as vectors\nfor gene therapy. Adenoviruses present several advantages for use as\ntherapeutic vectors: well-established methods for manipulation and\npropagation, episomal location in infected cells, capacity to accommodate\nlarge transgenes and ability to infect non-dividing cells [91]. Transduction with adenoviral\nvectors allows efficient expression of therapeutic genes in different\norgans, especially in the liver and to a lesser extent in the lung and\nbrain. Initial vectors, the so-called first-generation adenoviral\nvectors, lacked E1 protein and induced high immune responses, caused, in\npart, by type I IFN activation of VA RNAs [76], [77]. Therefore,\nfirst-generation adenoviral vectors allow only short-term expression of\nthe transgene. In order to overcome this inconvenience, more recent\nstrategies include the use of \u201cgutless\u201d or helper-dependent (HD) vectors.\nThese vectors lack all viral genes thus avoiding cellular immune\nresponses, have a high capacity for accommodation of transgene elements\nand maintain long-term expression of their genetic material.\nConditionally replicating adenoviruses (CRAd) have also been developed to\npreferentially destroy tumor cells. Among CRAd oncolytic adenovirus,\ndl1520/ ONYX-015 contains deletions in the E1b gene and Ad-D24 or\nONYX-411 lack a portion of E1a gene which restrict viral growth in\nnon-tumor cells. These replication-competent adenoviruses can also\naccommodate therapeutic transgenes. A clever strategy to increase the\noncolytic potential of adenovirus is the use of VA RNA-deleted\nadenoviruses. Such viruses can selectively grow in cells with inactive\nPKR, such as tumor cells with activated Ras or Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV)\npositive tumors in which PKR is blocked by expression of EBV RNAs similar\nto VA RNAs [92], [93], [94]. Finally, adenoviral vectors have also been\nused as vaccines [95].\nAdenoviral-based vaccines expressing VA RNAs may exploit VA activation of\ntype I IFN to act as an adjuvant and boost the immune response against\nthe desired antigen [76], [77]. This function of VA RNA is independent of VA\nRNA influence on the RNAi machinery. However, VA RNAs could affect the\nRNAi machinery when they are expressed from adenoviral vectors.",

            "text": "We are beginning to understand and to better\nexploit the relationship between adenoviral infection and the RNAi\nmachinery. Adenoviruses have evolved to simultaneously both use and block\nthis process. Expression and processing of high amounts of VA RNAs and\nmivaRNAs may lead to saturation of the pathway and, therefore, to the\nblocking of cellular miRNA control. At the same time, key enzymes of the\nRNAi machinery are loaded with non-coding viral RNAs, so they can\nefficiently control the expression of viral miRNA target genes. The main\nquestion that should still be addressed is: what is the benefit for the\nvirus of such a delicate equilibrium? Several authors have shown that the\nsilencing machinery may have an antiviral role. Theoretically,\nreplication intermediates of RNA viruses or abundant secondary structures\nof viral RNAs could be cleaved by Dicer to generate antiviral miRNAs. In\nfact, blocking Dicer function with silencing suppressors or specific\nshRNAs results in increased adenoviral titers ([107], Carnero et al., unpublished\nresults). However, the antiviral role of RNAi has not been clearly\ndemonstrated for animal viruses. Dicer processing of viral sequences to\ngenerate antiviral miRNAs has never been shown in viral-infected animal\ncells. Future experiments should also address the functional relevance of\nmivaRNAs. Viability should be studied in adenoviral versions that produce\nfunctional VA RNAs processed to mivaRNAs that are mutated in the seed\nsequence. Viral viability should also be studied in cells that\noverexpress or downregulate mivaRNA target genes in different\nenvironments. Animal models could be used to perform these experiments as\nit has been recently shown that Syrian hamsters are partially permissive\nfor adenoviral replication, which is impeded in murine cells\n[108], [109].\nFinally, special attention should be paid to the putative role of\ncellular miRNAs in viral infection. Taken together, all of these\napproaches should lead to the identification and validation of proteins\nand miRNAs with anti-adenoviral properties, which may also have relevance\nto other viruses of therapeutic interest. Moreover, these studies should\nallow the development of recombinant adenoviruses with increased efficacy\nfor gene therapy applications.",
