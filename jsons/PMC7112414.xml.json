            "text": "The product of proteins unfolding or misfolding lead to the exposure of hydrophobic patches which offers to interact through and leads to the formation of firm complex via transformation of soluble monomeric entities to large insoluble ones [3]. The establishment of novel interactions in the protein molecule occurs due to enhanced exposure of thiol groups or hydrophobic patches to thermally induced aggregation [4]. The cataract disease for instance is a result of aggregation of a \u03b3D-crystalline protein which has been categorized as amorphous in nature [5], similarly Fanconi syndrome [6], light-chain deposition disease (LCDD), and myeloma nephropathy [7]. While, Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, spongiform encephalopathies, and type II diabetes mellitus [1], [2], [8] are amyloid aggregates. In the production of bacterial recombinant proteins, the formed inclusion bodies are also classified as amorphous aggregates. It is an outcome of the accumulation of excessively produced polypeptides followed by the unavailability of sufficient chaperons to govern the folding process to rescue from aggregation and restoration of nascent peptides [9], [10]. In a similar vein in liquor industry, the amorphous aggregate formation takes place in the form of protein haze during the course of white wine production [11]. Thermally induced aggregation is one of the most studied factors where several proteins have been reported to have undergone the process of aggregate formation at elevated temperature but the effective temperature and duration of incubation fluctuates from protein to protein. For instance, a slight increase in the temperature (\u223c37 \u00b0C) can cause aggregation of the Apo form of muscle glycogen phosphorylase b (apoPhb) of rabbit origin [12], while Aquaporin 0 (AQP0) aggregates at 60 \u00b0C [13], bovine hemoglobin aggregates at \u223c70 \u00b0C [14], recombinant human interferon alpha2b (rhIFN\u03b12b) aggregates at 50 \u00b0C [15] while SARS-associated corona virus (SARS-CoV) protein aggregates at most extreme condition i.e. boiling temperature [16]. Thermal and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide [14], NaCl [17], acidic pH [18], metal [19], atheronal-A, atheronal-B, cholesterol [20], Rosin modified surfactant, (QMRAE) [21], non-fluorinated and fluorinated cosolvents [22] are few examples of physical as well as chemical inducer where protein unambiguously forms amorphous aggregate. While, cationic surfactant like CTAB induce amyloid fibrils in stem bromelain [23].",

In such trend, that dual function has been displayed by quercetin for the conformation conservation of insulin, which inhibits the fibril formation and also shows disorganizing ability by amyloid fibril (ordered structure) conversion into amorphous aggregates (unordered structure) [25]. In this series, clofazimine inhibits as well as destabilize the fibrils of hen egg white lysozyme [26]. Moreover, Aspartate-\u03b2-semi aldehyde dehydrogenase forms aggregates, via soluble to insoluble polymerization as function of concentration and time. Lumry\u2013Eyring with nucleated polymerization (LENP) model revealed that increasing concentrations of glycerol inhibits the formation of insoluble, high molecular weight aggregates by delaying the polymerization [27]. The weak polarity-reducing property of ethylene glycol curtails the interaction between hydrocarbon spacer arm mediated nonspecific interaction of N6-(6-Aminohexyl)-AMP and functional hydrophobic sites present on the pig heart lactate dehydrogenase. The low concentration of ethylene glycol achieves high retrieval of enzymatic activity along with increased yield of enzyme during chromatographic elution within the concentration range of 20\u201330% (v/v) [28]. Fat as additive used for prion, fetches the more trifling condition for its inactivation, while, glycerol provides stability to the prion 27\u201330 or prion rods during heat treatment by shielding the peptide backbone [29]. An earlier study on reversing the impact on mutant archetype of Familial Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease (CJD) H187R, has confirmed that glycerol effectively diminishes the PrP187R accumulation in lysosomes of transfected cells followed by transportation up to the cell surface [30].",

Further, immunomodulation [35], anti-oxidative [36] and anti-carcinogenicity [37] are the other significant biological activities associated with ovotransferrin. The primary goal of the current study is to induce aggregation in CA by thermal treatment and characterization the type of aggregates. Further, we checked the protective and anti-aggregation property of glycerol (GL) and ethylene glycol (EG) at 65 \u00b0C. To the best of our knowledge, no previous studies reported the GL and EG mediated inhibition of thermally induced amorphous aggregates by a multi-technique approach.",

The next set of temperature i.e. at 65 \u00b0C, the most sweeping consequence (% \u0394MRE215\n = 69) has been observed which show a single trough concentrated at 215 nm followed by much significant lowering in intensity compared to the previous set of temperature (Table 1\n).We have examined the outcome of the temperature increase within the range of 75\u201385 \u00b0C and detected very less amount of secondary structure % \u0394MRE215\n = 80 for 75 \u00b0C and 93 for 85 \u00b0C respectively, with great loss in signal on equating with native CA. During the temperature increase, the loss in MRE215nm continuously increased (Fig. 3A inset).",

The effect of GL continues in accordance with the gradual increase and nearly native-like secondary structure (Fig. 3B) was restored by final addition used, 15% (v/v). A similar stabilizing behavior of polyols has been established by gradual increase in the EG concentration added to CA. The lowest EG concentration of 5% (v/v) efficiently shields CA during thermal treatment and further addition of EG fortify this protective effect. During the stabilization of CA from thermal treatment, the final concentration of EG added, 35% was found to be sufficient to achieve native like spectra showing two negative minima with good ellipticity (Fig. 3C). The % \u0394MRE215 for GL15% (v/v) and EG 35% (v/v) was found to be \u22123 and \u22125 (Table 1), as shown in the plot (Fig. 3B\u2013C inset). The time dependent CD spectra of CA in presence of glycerol and EG reveal that restoration of secondary structure after 1 h was similar to the native one and restoration was constant up to 24 h that indicates the inhibition of CA aggregation in presence of polyols. The CD spectra of denatured state of CA at 75 \u00b0C and incubation up to 24 h show there is no re-naturation occurs of the denatured protein (Supplementary data 1).",

The native protein has a minimum exposure of hydrophobic cluster to the solvent and produce very low intensity upon its excitation at 380 nm. Following its exposure to more heat, CA unfolds and the level of exposure increases up to the 65 \u00b0C, at which protein undergoes unfolding followed by polymerization and within 1 h CA gets aggregated and fluorescence intensity is enhanced by \u223c13 fold than native (Table 1). At the temperature range 75\u201385 \u00b0C, the ANS shows a decrease in the fluorescence intensity but the intensity remains significant (Fig. 4D). The addition of polyols decreases the ANS fluorescence intensity as a function of increasing concentration by mediating the protein stabilization and regulating the exposure of hydrophobic patches (Fig. 4E\u2013F). At the highest added concentrations of GL 15% (v/v) and EG 35% (v/v), the slightly significant signals of ANS fluorescence suggest the presence of some little hydrophobic pockets on the surface of the induced secondary structure which provide site for ANS interaction (supplementary Fig. S2), (Table 1). It was also observed that the ANS itself strongly interacts with both of the polyols and its fluorescence intensity is enhanced as the concentration of GL and EG are increased (data not shown), so the resulting effect of the polyols addition on the exposed hydrophobic patches was obtained by subtracting the blank.",

We observed the neutrality of temperature range 25\u201345 \u00b0C on the \u03bbmax, while above this, a dramatic change with red shift of 9 nm was observed.

            "text": "This study demonstrates that the polyols (GL and EG) are successfully able to inhibit the temperature mediated amorphous aggregation and induce native like conformation. Our results have also extended the example in exception of such protein which shows significant ThT binding even with amorphous aggregates. The little expansion in the radius but condense the core size of conalbumin occurs upon the interaction with GL and EG. For the overall conformational restoration, GL was found to be more effective than EG as it requires 15% (v/v) as compared to EG 35% (v/v). It would be very significant in future studies to investigate how polyols are further affecting the activity of pre-incubated proteins on thermal or other destabilizing stress. In case of successful restoration of enzymatic activity of proteins upon the addition of low concentrations of polyols will provide excellent lead against the harsh conditions encountered by protein in industries as well as transportation. The inhibition is due to hindrance of hydrophobic interaction (responsible for aggregation) that is caused by compactness of proteins as a result of shifting of hydrophobic patches in the inner side of proteins. Further, glycerol due to its hydrophobic nature also competes for the hydrophobic patches on the proteins and affects the hydrophobic interactions.",
