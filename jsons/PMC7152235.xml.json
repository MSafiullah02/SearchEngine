As preparedness strategies become more standardized and evidence based, our ability to respond to public health emergencies, including biological attacks, will improve. Each chapter in Section 12 will cover a specific biological agent. The authors will outline what is known about the agent currently and, from this, attempt to extrapolate how this agent might be used in a bioterrorism attack.",
