In the present study, we analyzed genome-wide codon usage patterns in 13 SARS-CoV-2 isolates from different geo-locations (countries) by utilizing different CUB measurements. Nucleotide and di-nucleotide compositions displayed bias toward A/U content in all codon positions and CpU-ended codons preference, respectively. Relative Synonymous Codon Usage (RSCU) analysis revealed 8 common putative preferred codons among all the 13 isolates.",

Cluster analysis (based on RSCU values) was performed and showed comparable results to the phylogenetic analysis (based on their whole genome sequences) indicating that the CUB pattern may reflect the evolutionary relationship between the tested isolates. To investigate the force (mutation and/or selection) influencing the pattern of CUB in SARS-CoV-2 coding sequences, we employed the following; (i). Effective number of codons (ENc), (ii). ENc-GC3 plot, (iii). Neutrality plot, and (iv) Codon adaptation index (CAI). According to their results, natural selection and/or other factors (not investigated in this study) may be the dominant force driving SARS-CoV-2 CUB. It is also worth mentioning that, by using the most expressed genes in human lung tissues as a reference set, some viral genes such as Nucleocapsid phosphoprotein, ORF7a protein, and surface glycoprotein had high CAI values which may indicate for selection force acting on their codon usage, as they play important roles in viral assembly and may help viruses avoid the host immune system. The outcome of our study may help in understanding the underlying factors involved in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 viruses, and the interactions with their host. Also, it may aid in vaccine design strategies.",

One class is shared between RNA and DNA viruses, while 3 of them are occupied solely by RNA viruses reflecting their great diversity and different replicative mechanisms [1] . Over the past few decades, many human infectious diseases including, Ebola fever, avian influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) resulted from the interspecies transmission of zoonotic RNA viruses [2] [3] [4] . Most recently, the new pandemic EET). Preliminary phylogenetic analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 most closely related viruses were (bat-SL-CoVZC45) and a SARS-like beta-coronavirus of bat origin (bat-SL-CoVZXC21). Many encoded proteins revealed a high sequence identity except for the spike (S) protein and protein 13 (80% and 73% respectively) between SARS-CoV-2 and other batderived coronaviruses [5] . Two probable scenarios are suggested to explain the origin of SARS-CoV-2, natural selection in an animal host either before or following a zoonotic transfer [6] .",

            "text": "During the translation process from mRNA to protein, information is transmitted in the form of nucleotide triplets named codons. Amino acids are degenerate, having more than one codon representing each except for Methionine (Met) and Tryptophan (Trp). Thus, codons encoding the same amino acid are known as synonymous codons. Many studies on different organisms showed that synonymous codons are not used uniformly within and between genes of one genome. This phenomenon called synonymous codon usage bias (SCUB) or codon usage bias (CUB) [11] [12] [13] [14] . Further, the degree of the unequal use of synonymous codons differs between species [15, 16] . Hence, each organism has its optimal codons, where an optimal codon is defined as a codon which is more frequently used in highly expressed genes than in the slightly expressed genes [17] . Two main factors shape the codon usage of an organism mutation and selection [18] [19] [20] . Other factors also known to influence the CUB of an organism are nucleotide composition [21] , synonymous substitution rate [22] , tRNA abundance [23] , codon hydropathy and DNA replication initiation sites [24] , gene length [25] , and expression level [26] . Since viruses rely on the tRNA pool of their hosts in the translation process, previous studies suggest that translational selection and/or directional mutational pressure act on the codon usage of the viral genome to optimize or deoptimize it towards the codon usage of their hosts [27, 28] . Hence, it is important to examine viral gene structures and compositions at the codon or nucleotide level to reveal the mechanisms of virus-host relationships and virus evolution [29] .",

Our results showed that, CAI values ( Table 1 ) ranged from 0.53 (Pakistan isolate) to 0.54 (Taiwan isolate). As well as, some genes showed a higher CAI with an average of 0.62 (nucleocapsid phosphoprotein gene) and ORF7a protein gene displayed a CAI value of 0.58. The CAI results for SARS-CoV-2 isolates revealed a moderate host-virus co-adaptation, also the CDS for the SARS-CoV-2 can utilize the human cell resources for its translation process efficiently. Moreover, the highest CAI value was recorded for nucleocapsid phosphoprotein gene (0.62) which plays a fundamental role during viral self-assembly [63] . The second highest gene with CAI 0.58 was ORF7a, which may play a role in viral assembly or budding events unique to SARS-CoV [64] . The CAI results for both genes reflect their importance (viral assembly and budding events) for the SARS-CoV-2 virus to complete its life-cycle efficiently in the host cell. Only small amounts of the Envelope (E) protein is sufficient to trigger the formation of virus-like particles [63] , which may explain its lowest CAI value (0.48) among other genes.",

Moreover, the 8 common putative preferred codons (over-representative codons) determined in this study had either A or U end nucleotides with the absence of G and C ones. Furthermore, some genes such as Nucleocapsid phosphoprotein, ORF7a protein, and Surface glycoprotein had slightly high CAI values which may indicate for selection force acting on their codon usage, as they play important roles in viral assembly and may help viruses avoid the host immune system.",

The cluster (Heat map) analysis revealed this pattern as all of the previously mentioned putative preferred codons clustered together Fig. 3. It is quite interesting to note that all 8 over-represented codons are A/Uended (U-ended: 7, A-ended: 1), and none of them was G/C-ended. Meanwhile, most of the under-represented codons are G/C-ended. Furthermore, 4 out of the 8 over-represented codons (RSCU > 1.6) ended with CpU dinucleotide, which was mentioned before as the most over-representative dinucleotide.

The clustering of the 13 isolates on the top side of Fig. 3 yielded two major branches (A, and B). The isolate from Pakistan separated itself in branch A from the other 12 isolates in branch B indicating its unique codon usage pattern. Branch B can be further divided into 3 sub-branches: two of them contained South Korea, and the USA being closer to Pakistan isolate than the remaining ones. Meanwhile, the third sub-branch contained two main clusters that are fairly closer to the USA than South Korea. Isolates from India and Spain are grouped in one cluster. The other cluster contained two sub-clusters in which isolates from Australia, Sweden, Brazil and Italy are grouped in one sub-cluster away from China, Nepal, Taiwan and Vietnam isolate in the other sub-cluster. To gain more insight into the evolutionary relationships between the 13 SARS-CoV-2 isolates, phylogenetic analysis was performed based on their whole genome sequences (Fig. 4). It yielded two main branches: one contained the outgroup (Human betacoronavirus 2c EMC/2012) separated from other SARS-CoV-2 isolates. The branch containing SARS-CoV-2 isolates can be divided into 3 sub-branches: two of them contained the USA, and Pakistan isolates closer to each other than other SARS-CoV-2 isolates, however, the third sub-branch contained two main clusters that are fairly closer to Pakistan isolate than the USA. One cluster containing isolates from Nepal, Taiwan, China, Vietnam, India, and Spain can be further divided into two sub-clusters, where isolates from India and Spain are grouped in one sub-cluster away from others. The other main cluster containing isolates from South Korea, Brazil, Italy, Sweden, and Australia can be also further divided into two sub-clusters, where isolates from Sweden and Australia are grouped in a sub-cluster away from the others. Despite the differences between hierarchical clustering and phylogenetic analyses, they exhibited similarities that can be summarized in the following 4 points. (i). Both Pakistan and the USA isolates showed clear relatedness in both dendrograms that separated them away from other SARS-CoV-2 isolates. However, Pakistan isolate is further than the USA from the remaining isolates from codon usage bias perspective indicating its unique codon usage bias. That wasn't the case in the phylogenetic tree as Pakistan showed more relatedness to other isolates than the USA from an evolutionary perspective based on their whole-genome sequence similarities. (ii). Isolates from India and Spain grouped themselves in a sub-cluster in the phylogenetic tree and were also present in the same sub-cluster in RSCU clustering analysis indicating their highly similar patterns of codon usage bias and evolutionary relatedness. (iii). Isolates from Sweden, Australia, Brazil, and Italy fell into the same cluster in both analyses where Sweden and Australia being the closest to each other. (iv). Isolates from Nepal, Taiwan, China, and Vietnam also fell into the same cluster in both analyses. The hierarchical clustering and phylogenetic analyses clearly showed that, despite the evolutionary relatedness of the 13 SARS-CoV-2 isolates based on their whole-genome sequence similarities, their pattern of codon usage bias may differ slightly. Investigating the forces influencing the pattern of CUB in SARS-CoV-2 coding sequences Effective number of codons (ENc) and ENc-GC3 plot In theory, ENc correlates negatively with CUB. For all isolates, the CDS average ENc value was around 48.54 with SD = 0.5 (Supplementary file 3), except for SARS-CoV-2-Pakistan the average ENc was equal to 46.63. As well as, within the genes for each isolate, ENc values ranged from 39.94 to 55.89 (Supplementary files 3), showing a wide range of ENc (CUB).",

The slope of the regression line across all isolates showed values ranging from 0.163 to 0.197 with an average of 0.1835 except one isolate from Pakistan had a relatively lower slope value of 0.0559. Therefore, our results suggest that, the relative neutrality (mutation pressure) had the minor effect (5.59% and 18.35%) on codon usage bias across all 13 isolates, and the main evolutionary force driving codon usage bias is the relative constraints on GC3 (natural selection) (94.41% and 81.65%).",
