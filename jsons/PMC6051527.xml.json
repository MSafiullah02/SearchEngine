Indeed, more than half of the children on our planet live in malaria-endemic countries. Despite continued success in malaria control, there are more than 200 million new infections each year and nearly half a million deaths, mostly in infants and children younger than 5 years old.2 Importantly, in our increasingly global society, malaria and other imported infectious diseases remain of particular concern to the North American traveler, with nearly all American malaria cases acquired abroad.3, 4, 5, 6\n",

Sporozoites then migrate to the liver, asymptomatically invade hepatocytes, and amplify infection through the release of tens of thousands of daughter parasites. This release initiates the asexual erythrocytic replication stage of the parasite life cycle, the stage of parasite responsible for the malaria pathogenesis. Two species of Plasmodium, P vivax and P ovale, uniquely develop dormant parasite forms called hypnozoites, which may remain in the liver for months or years after primary infection before causing relapse and recurrent symptomatic disease.9, 10\n",

Due to its arrhythmogenic cardiotoxicity, quinidine treatment requires cardiac telemetry and QTc monitoring.31 As of 2007, intravenous artesunate, produced following Good Manufacturing Practices, has been made available on an emergency basis, through an investigational new drug protocol (FDA IND protocol # 76,725) for the treatment of severe malaria in the United States. Clinicians treating pediatric patients with severe malaria are encouraged to consult the CDC Malaria Hotline, which provides expert clinical advice and release of intravenous artesunate with severe malaria patients in whom quinidine is not appropriate.48 Additional malaria treatment guidelines and dosing specifications can be found on the CDC Web site (https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/diagnosis_treatment/treatment.html). Monotherapy for malaria is not recommended and, therefore, all cases of severe malaria require a second agent, such as tetracycline, doxycycline, or clindamycin (intravenous or oral).32, 37 There is no consensus about the efficacy of exchange blood transfusion for severe disease.32, 49, 50\n",

Pyrimethamine should be avoided in the first few weeks of life because it competes with bilirubin and may aggravate neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. Data are limited on the safety and tolerability of primaquine in young infants, which is, therefore, contraindicated in children younger than 6 months of age, and tetracyclines are contraindicated for children younger than 8 years of age. Parenteral antimalarial treatment may be required for treatment of uncomplicated malaria in children with prominent gastrointestinal symptoms, until oral administration is possible.32, 37\nBest Practices\nWhat is the current practice?Pediatric malaria infectionBest practice, guideline, and care path objectives\u2022Counsel travelers to malaria-endemic regions on the ABCs of protective measures against infection, including limiting mosquito contact and chemoprophylaxis.\u2022Consider malaria in the differential for any infant or child presenting with nonspecific febrile illness, particularly in returning travelers.\u2022Rapid recognition and diagnosis of malaria infection is necessary to prevent disease progression.\u2022Treatment of malaria depends on disease severity, Plasmodium species, and likelihood of antimalarial resistance.\n\n\nWhat changes in current practice are likely to improve outcomes?\u2022Improve adherence to antimalarial regimens and other prevention techniques through proper traveler education.\u2022A travel history should be obtained for all pediatric patients presenting with fever or flu-like symptoms.\u2022Monotherapeutic regimens that promote development of drug resistance should be avoided.Treatment recommendations\u2022Diagnosis depends on microscopic analysis of rapid antigen testing and thick and thin blood smears.\u2022Combination malaria treatment is based on disease severity, parasite species, and likelihood of drug resistance.\u2022For P vivax and P ovale, primaquine treatment (following G6PD testing) is necessary to prevent relapse from latent liver stages.\n\nSummaryProperly informing travelers to malaria-endemic regions about preventative measures for infection is the most effective means of promoting adherence and preventing transmission. In the event of malaria infection, a high index of suspicion, rapid diagnosis, and immediate treatment is critical to prevent the morbidity and mortality associated with disease progression, particularly in pediatric patients.\n",
