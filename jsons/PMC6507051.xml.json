It is considered to be the most common zoonosis worldwide and is usually transmitted from rodents, dogs and cats when an infected animal or an animal\u2019s urine comes into contact with broken skin. The incubation time is 7\u201314 days. Absence of infected skin makes the entry unidentifiable in most cases. The clinical spectrum ranges from a subclinical infection to a fulminant septic course. Typical symptoms are shivering, fever, myalgia, conjunctival suffusion, vomiting and diarrhea. Icteric and unicteric courses are known. Jaundice is considered as a sign of liver dysfunction but can occur without necrosis of the liver. Antibiotic treatment must be initiated early. Most cases of leptospirosis are described from tropical or subtropical regions. In Germany, approximately 60 cases occur each year [1]. Here, we report the case of a German patient, who presented with acute pancreatitis associated with Leptospira interrogans causing fulminant septic shock.",

A stool test for Clostridium difficile antigen was negative. Further sampling by blood cultures, tracheal secretion and urine-analyses showed no growth of any bacteria. A screening for MRSA was negative, as were serologic tests for Hepatits B, Hepatitis C, mumps and Epstein-Barr virus. Acute liver failure with jaundice, hemorrhagic diathesis with purpura and petechiae combined with acute kidney injury accompanied by an odd transient macular, erythematous rash directed to serologic testing for leptospirosis. It revealed strong positive IgG and IgM antibodies. While leptospirosis PCR in the blood was negative, analysis of the tracheal secretion taken during his stay on the ICU revealed the presence of Leptospira interrogans DNA. Urine analysis performed at the same time however remained negative for leptospirosis DNA by PCR. PCR was performed by the Institute of Microbiology and Hygiene of the University of Freiburg, Germany, which is accredited by the DAkkS (Deutsche Akkreditierungsstelle, Berlin, Germany) for leptospira PCR for probes of both sterile and non-sterile origin.",

Few cases with leptospirosis have been described in South Europe: One with pancreatitis and cholecystitis in Greece in 2004 [3]. Another case from Greece about a patient from Congo reported pancreatitis in combination with myocarditis, polyarthritis, mononeuritis multiplex and vasculitis with symmetrical peripheral gangrene of the lower extremities [4]. A similar case from Romania was reported in 2013 with necrotizing pancreatitis and severe anemia which required surgical therapy [5]. Some cases with leptospirosis leading to pancreatitis have been described in tropical or subtropical regions [6\u201318]. An overview of the previously described cases of leptospirosis and pancreatitis can be found in Table 2. However, diagnosis of pancreatitis was often based on amylase-levels [4, 6, 12\u201314, 18]. These cases have to be interpreted with caution as amylase is often increased in patients with renal failure which is one of the most common manifestations of leptospirosis [19, 20]. Analysis of pancreatic lipase should be preferred as it is more specific for the diagnosis of pancreatitis.",

Leptospirosis is thought to cause systemic vasculitis in which inflammation of the vascular walls may be a consequence of the direct invasion of the infectious agent or of immune mechanisms such as immune complex deposition, auto-antibodies or cell-mediated immunity [19, 21, 22].
