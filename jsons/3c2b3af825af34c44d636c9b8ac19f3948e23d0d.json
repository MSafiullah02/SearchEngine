In the first study volunteers were challenged with rhinoviruses (RV9 and RVI4), and in the second study with respiratory coronavirus. In both studies, active and placebo groups of volunteers were demographically similar. Infection rates in both groups were also similar. There were no withdrawals resulting from unusual symptoms related to either treatment. In the rhinovirus study (19, placebo: 20, nedocromil sodium) daily symptom scores and daily mean nasal secretion weights were significantly lower in the nedocromil sodium-treated group. In the coronavirus study (26, placebo; 27, nedocromil sodium) there was little difference in the severity of colds between the active and placebo-treated groups, but trends favoured nedocromil sodium. In both studies the impairment of performance in volunteers who developed a cold was significantly less in those treated with nedocromil sodium than in those treated with placebo.",

After a 2-day quarantine period, subjects were assigned randomly by number in sequence to active or placebo treatment groups; the code was not broken until all clinical and viroiogical data had been reported. Medication consisted of one spray to each nostril four times a day under supervision (at 8 a.m., 1 p.m.. 6 p.m. and 10.30 p.m.) for 7 days. One hour after the fifth dose of medication, volunteers received nasal drops containing the challenge virus. For rhinovirus the nasal challenge contained an estimated 100 TCID50 of human RV9 followed by a similar inoculum of RVI4 1 hr later. For coronavirus, the single challenge dose was approximately 750 TCID50 of a strain of 229E. In both studies a small number of volunteers were given saline instead of virus, thus providing information on tolerance to the drug as well as maintaining the double-blind nature ofthe trial.",

However, in this study there was no correlation between obsessional score and nasai secretion weight or clinical score when all volunteers were included; a negative correlation was demonstrated for volunteers within the placebo group. Therefore it is concluded that the reduced mean daily clinical scores and secretion weights were attributable to the action of nedocromil sodium. If this is correct then some colds which would have been classified as significant without drug might be assessed as doubtful colds when the drug is given. In the rhinovirus trial 13 (81%) ofthe 16 infected subjects who received placebo developed significant colds compared with only 10 (50%) of those given drug. However, If doubtful colds are included, 87 5% of placebo recipients had symptoms compared with 70% of those given drug.

However., as in the rhinovirus trials, if doubtful colds are included 16 volunteers in each group had upper respiratory symptoms. There was little difference in the mean clinical scores between the treatment groups despite the differences in nasal secretion weights. Increased nasal secretion is reflected in increased use of paper tissues and the later contributes heavily to the clinical score.

It is reported elsewhere how minor respiratory infections are associated with measureable and substantial declines in human performance and that the decline is specific, for example, colds impair performance in tasks measuring hand/eye coordination but not those requiring attention [11.18] . In both these trials, nedocromil sodium prevented loss of performance in subjects suffering clinical symptoms of colds, although the explanation for this is not known. Volunteers who were given the drug but did not develop a cold showed slower performance than those without a cold who had been given the placebo. At the moment it is unclear exactly what is responsible for this effect. In the rhinovirus trial there were more volunteers with subclinical infections in the drug group compared to the placebo group. Previous studies have shown that even sub-clinical infections may impair performance [19] and this could be one of the factors contributing to the slower response times in the no colds/drug group. Viral infections of the upper respiratory tract precipitate exacerbations of asthma and increase airway responsiveness in asthmatic patients [20] as well as in normal subjests [21] , although this finding is questioned by others [22] . Nedocromil sodium inhibits the release of mediators from inflammatory cells and reduces inflammation ofthe airways associated with asthma [23] . Could similar mechanisms account for the beneficial effect, shown here, of nedocromil sodium on the symptomatology of experimental colds? The recent study reported by the Common Cold Unit failed to show raised levels of LTB4 and LTC4 or histamine [8] , mediators which have been implicated in asthma, in the nasal secretions of subjects following viral inoculation. However, the inability to detect these mediators by direct methods does not exclude them from playing a role, albeit minor, in the common cold. Present knowledge ofthe mode of action of nedocromil together with the reduction we observed in the symptomology of rhinovirus and coronavirus infections in volunteers given this compound suggest that such mediators may be responsible for some of the symptoms in upper respiratory viral infections.",
