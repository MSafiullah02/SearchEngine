Increased levels of IL-6 are found in patients with chronic renal disease (CRD) particularly those on hemodialysis; increased IL-6 is associated with greater risk of depression, malnutrition, inflammation, atherosclerosis, cardiovascular events and mortality [2\u20135]. It has been suggested that circulating levels of IL-6 may vary depending on the carriage of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the promoter region of the IL-6 gene [6]. Several studies are published providing conflicting evidence for the role of carriage of minor frequency alleles of these SNPs for genetic predisposition to CRD. The most broadly studied is the G/C SNP at the \u2212174 promoter position of IL-6. Two studies have shown that patients with the GC genotype are susceptible to end stage renal disease (ESRD) [7, 8]. Several studies on the association of this SNP with susceptibility to sepsis have provided contradictory results. More precisely, in one study the CC genotype was associated with increased susceptibility for sepsis acquisition whereas in two other studies the GG genotype was associated with better outcome [9\u201311].",

However, analysis of Table 4, which showed a borderline significantly greater frequency of MODS among patients with the GG genotype of rs1800796 than patients with the GC and CC genotypes of rs1800796, led to compare circulating IL-6 separately for patients who were presented on the first day with MODS and for those who did not have MODS on initial admission. Circulating IL-6 was greater among patients of the GC and CC genotypes and MODS than among patients with the GG genotype and MODS. A similar difference was not found among patients without MODS (Fig. 2a and b). This finding corroborates that at the early presentation of sepsis with MODS, the GC and CC genotypes were associated with a more pro-inflammatory response. This is in accordance with the causality of death to the initial sepsis episode at a greater frequency among patients with the GC and CC genotypes of rs1800796 than among patients with the GG genotype of rs1800796. Since the overall mortality did not differ between patients with the GG genotype and patients of the GC and CC genotypes, it was not surprising to find that IL-6 levels were greater in non-survivors and in survivors irrespective of the genotype (Fig. 2c).\n",

When sepsis develops, carriage of this genotype is less pro-inflammatory, as evidenced by lower circulating IL-6 in most severe cases with MODS. However, carriage of this GG genotype is associated with death due to cardiovascular events not related to sepsis.
