Although comprehensive, the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System data do not include patient demographics and therefore do not specifically provide information about the epidemiology of respiratory viruses in older adults or LTCFs. Additionally, other than to rule out influenza, for which there is effective antiviral therapy, molecular diagnostic tests are not yet widely used in the evaluation of older adults or LTCF residents with respiratory infections. Accordingly, most of our understanding of the epidemiology of noninfluenza respiratory infections among older adults is informed through research studies and descriptions of outbreaks in LTCFs (Table 1\n).",

In 2008, active surveillance for symptomatic and asymptomatic respiratory viral infections detected an RSV outbreak in a 56-room, 120-bed LTCF in North Carolina.12 Among 52 residents, 22 (42%) developed respiratory tract infections and, of those, 7 (32%) had an RSV infection confirmed using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). One resident required hospitalization and subsequently died. This study in particular is notable for using RT-PCR to support timely and accurate recognition of an RSV outbreak. Although active surveillance for RSV may be useful in early diagnosis and, therefore, in outbreak prevention, the expense and resource use involved may render them impractical for most LTCFs.",

Unfortunately, clinical manifestations do not permit identification of specific viral pathogens, including RSV.5, 13 In a prospective study, Walsh and colleagues13 assessed the clinical characteristics of older adults living in the community or retirement homes who were admitted to the hospital with an acute respiratory illness. Using culture, RT-PCR, serologic analysis, or a combination of these tests, they identified 132 patients with RSV infection and 144 with influenza A virus. They reported that RSV, compared with influenza A, was more commonly associated with nasal congestion (68% vs 55%; P = .03), lower temperature at admission (37.7\u00b0C vs 38.1\u00b0C; P = .004) and wheezing by history (73% vs 53%; P = .002) or on physical examination (82% vs 68%; P = .02).

Among symptom-free controls, these rates were 2% (2/91), 2% (2/91), and 0% (0/91), respectively.

Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that current smoking (odds ratio, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.14\u20131.90) and chronic medical conditions (odds ratio, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.17\u20131.68) were independently associated with lower respiratory complications.

From 92 symptomatic residents at the 3 institutions, staff obtained 27 nasopharyngeal swabs. PCR-based tested detected HCoV-OC43 RNA in 59% of the specimens (16/27); no other viruses were isolated. Additionally, among 85 staff members, 37 developed respiratory symptoms, indicating an attack rate of 44%. Not surprisingly, epidemiologic investigations determined that LTCF staff members were the index case in 2 of the 3 LTCFs. The second report also describes an outbreak of HCoV-OC43. In the summer of 2003, an LTCF in British Columbia, Canada, reported that 67% of their residents (95/142) and 33% of their staff members (53/160) developed respiratory infections.59 Eight residents died. Interestingly, the outbreak was initially attributed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus owing to cross-reactivity to antibodies against nucleocapsid proteins from both viruses. Subsequently, RT-PCR confirmed HCoV-OC43. Together, these 2 outbreaks suggest that HCoV-OC43 represents a virulent pathogen for older adults in LTCFs. Additionally, they also highlight the role that ill health care workers may have in transmitting illnesses to LCTF residents.",

A large, prospective, cohort study by Walsh and colleagues60 details clinical features of HCoV infection in adults. In Rochester, New York, adults who developed an acute respiratory illness in the winter months from 1999 to 2003 underwent surveillance with RT-PCR and serologic studies. The adults included 4 cohorts: healthy older adults (n = 611; age 75 \u00b1 6 years), high-risk adults with underlying cardiopulmonary disease (n = 511; age 70 \u00b1 11 years), healthy young adults (n = 291; age 33 \u00b1 5 years), and a hospitalized group (n = 1388; age 75 \u00b1 12 years). During the study period, testing identified 398 HCoV infections from all cohorts, 214 of which (54%) were symptomatic. Of those, 10% (21/214) of them had evidence of viral coinfection. Manifestations of HCoV infection among prospective cohorts excluding the hospitalized group were congestion (98%\u2013100%), constitutional symptoms (53%\u201374%), and cough (40%\u201379%). Fever was not common; the mean temperature ranged 36.4\u00b0C to 36.8\u00b0C. Asymptomatic infection, defined as a 4-fold or greater increase in HCoV-specific serum IgG in the absence of respiratory symptoms, was common, ranging from 33% to 44% in prospective cohorts. Among 71 HCoV infections in the hospitalized group, 23 (32.3%) had infiltrate on chest radiography and 3 (4.2%) died. Although capable of causing acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or community-acquired pneumonia, most HCoV infections seem to be less severe than those caused by RSV, HMPV, and PIV.61, 62\n",

Ideally, among older adults in whom a viral pneumonia is suspected, procalcitonin results that confirm the absence of a bacterial infection should help clinicians to stop antibiotics. A recent systematic review concluded that using procalcitonin to guide initiation and duration of antibiotic treatment in patients with acute respiratory infections reduced antibiotic consumption and was not associated with higher mortality rates or treatment failure.90 Procalcitonin is not yet available as a point-of-care test and is, therefore, still relegated primarily for use in research and acute care settings.",

Molecular testing improves detection for bacterial and viral pathogens, but the implications of test results for clinical care are not yet clear. Gadsby and colleagues92 collected sputum (96%) and endotracheal aspirates (4%) from 323 adults hospitalized for community-acquired pneumonia. Based on multiplex PCR, they detected viruses in 30% of patients (98/323), with 82% of viruses (80/98) codetected with bacteria. These results suggested potential deescalation of antibiotics in 77% of cases, but the authors did not specifically describe stopping antibiotic therapy.",

For residents with respiratory infections, the Loeb minimum criteria for initiation of antibiotics call for assessment of vital signs (temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate), symptoms (cough, sputum, and rigors), delirium, and medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. These criteria do not require blood tests or imaging studies, permitting them to help inform clinical decisions about active monitoring versus initiating antibiotics in resource-limited settings.
