Of note is the high rate of underlying comorbidity in patients with MERS (table\n). Since the first cases were reported in April, 2012, from Jordan, most cases have been reported from Saudi Arabia where the Hajj, the largest religious mass gathering, takes place annually. Given the predicted population movements out of Saudi Arabia, potential for worldwide spread of MERS-CoV exists according to Kahn and colleagues.2 By contrast, Breban and colleagues3 calculated that the risk of MERS-CoV to have pandemic potential does not exceed 5%, but they did not take into account the effect of Hajj mass gathering in their scenario.",

No case of MERS-CoV nasal carriage was identified in our cohort, despite high rates of respiratory symptoms.4 However, we reported rapid acquisition of other respiratory viruses in pilgrims during their stay in Saudi Arabia\u2014most notably, rhinovirus\u2014emphasising the potential of these infections to spread in the pilgrims' home countries on their return.5 The 2013 mandatory meningococcal vaccination campaign for Hajj was started on Aug 19, at our institution. Early results of the first week show that pilgrims preparing for Hajj this year were younger and less likely to present with comorbidity than in 2012; however, 48% had at least one disorder for which the Saudi MoH recommends to postpone the performance of the Hajj. Although our results cannot be extrapolated to all Hajj pilgrims, they clearly show that a substantial proportion of European pilgrims departing from southern France are unlikely to heed the recommendations set out by the Saudi MoH.",

Such measures have already been highly accepted by pilgrims.6 The presence of MERS-CoV neutralising antibodies in dromedary camels in Oman and the Canary Islands might provide a clue as to a potential source for human infection, although the presence of MERS-CoV in camels has not been established.7 We recently investigated the willingness of French pilgrims to consume raw camel milk if offered during their stay in Saudi Arabia; 41% said that they would drink it if offered.8 Given that camel milk consumption in the Middle East is associated with several zoonotic infections, we recommend that Hajj pilgrims be cautioned against consuming unpasteurised dairy products. Following recent isolation of MERS-CoV from the faeces of a bat in Saudi Arabia, we recommend people avoid contact with both farm and wild animals.9\n",
