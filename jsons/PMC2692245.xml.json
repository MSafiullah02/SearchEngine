Pandemic influenza, which occurs when a new virus emerges and infects people globally that have little or no immunity, represents a grave threat to human health; for example, the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic caused an estimated 50 million deaths2,3. Vaccines have historically been the mainstay of infection control. However, owing to rapid antigenic drift, the vaccine antigen must be updated annually based on global influenza surveillance4,5, and it is not always fully successful. In addition, some recent H5N1 vaccines have shown promising results6,7,8,9, but none has been reported to elicit a broad neutralizing response in humans. Neuraminidase inhibitors, especially oseltamavir (Tamiflu), remain the primary treatment, but they have limited efficacy if administered late in infection, and widespread use is likely to result in the emergence of resistant viral strains10,11.",

On the basis of crystallographic and functional studies, we showed that the nAbs bind to a common epitope\u2014a highly conserved pocket in the stem region of hemagglutinin containing the 'fusion peptide'\u2014that rationalizes their ability to block membrane fusion rather than cell attachment. Sequence and structural analysis of all 16 hemagglutinin subtypes point to the existence of just two variants of this epitope, corresponding to the two classic phylogenetic groupings of hemagglutinin (groups 1 and 2). We therefore tested eight more group 1 hemagglutinin subtypes and demonstrated an unprecedented cross-subtype binding and/or neutralization spectrum. Because we had used a group 1 subtype (H5) for our panning, our nAbs, as expected, failed to neutralize group 2 subtypes H3 and H7. These results nevertheless raise the possibility that a cocktail comprising a small subset of nAbs raised against representatives of the two groups could provide broad protection against all seasonal and pandemic influenza A viruses.",

We used H5 activated by cleavage of the single-chain precursor, HA0, into two polypeptides, HA1 and HA2. Cleavage leads to the partial burial of the fusion peptide (the first \u223c21 residues of each HA2) into the stem19,21, which also contributes to the formation of each of three hydrophobic 'pockets' located below the large trimeric receptor binding head.

Only the heavy chain (VH) participates directly in binding, using all three of its complementarity-determining regions (CDRs). The light chain (VL) points out into solution and makes only nonspecific contacts with the distal end of the oligosaccharide of glycosylated residue Asn331 from a neighboring monomer.

(ii) Tyr102 from CDR-H3 extends from the apex of the H3 loop to a location only \u223c3 \u00c5 from Phe55, and it complements CDR-H2 by cementing together the fusion peptide (via a main chain hydrogen bond to Asp192) and the \u03b1A helix of HA2 (by intercalating between Thr412 and Ile452).

Thus, the F10 nAb may stabilize the fusion peptide of more than one subunit.

In addition, free-energy calculations26 point to dominant binding contributions (\u223c70% of the total favorable free energy) of the three conserved residues in the VH segment (Fig. 4b). In CDR-H2 derived from germline VH1-69, position 55 is always phenylalanine, and position 54 is always hydrophobic (methionine, isoleucine, leucine or valine). In our nAbs, CDR-H3 always has a tyrosine predicted to lie at the tip of the CDR3 loop (conserved at the position 6). The conformation and sequence of the CDR1 loop does not seem to be critical, because the other antibodies we isolated do not contain the somatic mutation (G26E) found in F10 and are predicted to have canonical structures. The sixth VH gene we isolated is derived from the germline gene VH1-2; its H2 loop has the same length as VH1-69, but by virtue of a change from alanine to arginine at position 72 (ref. 22) it is predicted to adopt a distinct conformation ('type 3') that presents loop residues 3 and 4 to the antigen (rather than residues 4 and 5 in type 2 loops). The specific somatic mutation at position 4, from asparagine to methionine, presumably promotes H5 binding. It is not possible to predict the structure of the larger H3 loop, but a tyrosine located at the center of the loop may play an analogous role to that in F10.",

Rather, they lock the fusion peptide and helix \u03b1A in place, thereby preventing the large structural reorganizations that are required for membrane fusion17,19,27,28,29,30. Our data point to this event occurring at an early step in infection, although we cannot rule out the possibility that the nAbs act at a later stage, given the close packing of molecules on the surface of the mature virion, which might restrict early access to the epitope. The only previously published crystal structure of a hemagglutinin-nAb complex that inhibits membrane fusion uses a different mechanism: it prevents conformational changes by cross-linking the upper surfaces of adjacent subunits in the head31.",

(i) At its center, the sequence of the N-terminal segment of HA2\u2014fusion peptide residues 182\u2013212\u2014is conserved across all hemagglutinin subtypes (note that the side chain at position 192 does not participate in binding).

Thr492 lies at the periphery of the epitope and makes one long hydrogen bond (3.5 \u00c5) to Ser31. Simple modeling suggests that there is plenty of space to accommodate the larger glutamine side chain and that it can make comparable hydrogen bonds.

These differences arise from group-specific differences in the location of buried residues, notably histidines (H1112 is unique to group 1; H171 is unique to group 2) that have been proposed to be the 'triggers' for pH-induced conformational changes29. The differences cause the side chain of Trp212 to turn through 90\u00b0 in group 2 subtypes, eliminating favorable binding to Phe55 from our nAb panel. In addition, four out of six group 2 subtypes are glycosylated at position 381, at the periphery of the F10 epitope; our modeling studies predict steric clashes with the CDR-H1 loop (data not shown).

It is straightforward to model the locations of the F10 epitope residues in this model of the fusogenic state (Supplementary Note 1 online). All eight epitope residues, which were fully exposed in the neutral pH structure, become either part of the new hydrophobic bundle core (Thr412, Ile452, Val522 and Ile562) or they make networks of hydrogen bonds with the C-terminal arms and other elements that stabilize the new bundle (Lys 382, Gln422, Thr492 and Asn532). The requirement for adopting two entirely different conformations, each with a distinct hydrophobic core and hydrogen-bonding network may place powerful evolutionary constraints on the sequence of the helix, as evidenced by the almost complete lack of genetic drift within helix \u03b1A among the 16 hemagglutinin subtypes.",

Moreover, C179 was shown to block membrane fusion rather than cell attachment and to protect mice against viral challenge41, although a detailed mechanism was not reported. We compared the activities of C179 and F10 and found that both showed similar binding toward H5. We also found that F10 efficiently competed with C179 for binding to H5, but not vice versa (Supplementary Fig. 9 online). Furthermore, the point mutant V522E abrogated binding to both antibodies, whereas T3181K affected only C179 binding.

            "text": "The manner in which hemagglutinin was presented to the antibody phage-display library in this study seems to have been crucial in our success, because similar attempts to isolate broadly nAbs using cell-surface expressed hemagglutinin showed only partial success against H5, and most antibodies recognized linear epitopes42. As noted above, we repeatedly isolated nAbs that use the same VH germline gene (IGHV1-69 or 'VH1-69'). One published study pointed out that this is the only VH gene that consistently encodes two hydrophobic residues at the tip of its CDR-H2 loop43; indeed, it is the only germline gene to encode a phenylalanine at this position, which makes several crucial interactions with H5. Moreover, the 'type 2' H2 loop, which is long and compact, is predicted to occur in only 4 out of the \u223c50 human germline genes. These factors may explain at least in part the ability of nAbs derived from this germline gene to cross-react with viral epitopes through their unusual ability to bind to conserved hydrophobic pockets. Such pockets are likely to have an important function and for this reason they are often cryptic in the unactivated state of the antigen. For example, VH1-69 is the predominant gene used by a group of CD4-induced nAbs raised against the HIV-1 surface glycoprotein, gp120, where the pocket is part of a conserved co-receptor binding site that is exposed only transiently upon binding to its primary receptor, CD4 (ref. 43). Similarly, an antibody raised against the HIV gp41 trimeric 'inner-core' fusion protein intermediate uses the hydrophobic tip of its VH1-69 CDR-H2 loop to insert into a conserved hydrophobic pocket that blocks further assembly to the fusion-competent six-helix structure44. In vivo, B cells carrying the VH1-69 gene are the primary mediators of innate defense against HCV infection, generating antibodies against its membrane-fusion glycoprotein, E2 (ref. 45), although the epitope and mode of action have not been determined. Notably, as we found here, VH1-69 is not the only germline gene that is suitable for achieving neutralization in a similar manner. Another recent example is a nAb against the Ebola virus surface glycoprotein, KZ52, which uses the VH3-21 germline gene46. However, their common ability to lock viral envelope proteins into a nonfusogenic conformation suggests a general strategy for broad-spectrum and/or potent viral neutralization.",

The authors postulated that the reason for survival was an effective humoral immune response mediated by such nAb-generating B cells in vivo47, although no control populations were studied. Analysis of their data (Supplementary Note 3 online) indicates that the antibodies are also derived from the VH1-69 germline gene and share other key characteristics, including the methionine-phenylalanine pair in CDR-H2 and a tyrosine at the tip of CDR-H3. Thus it would seem, at least in this case, that our non-immune (H5-naive) donor library approach generated antibodies with characteristics similar to those found using immunized donor\u2013based phage-display libraries derived from H5N1 survivors.",

It is unlikely that the F10 epitope provokes self-tolerance mechanism(s) via auto-antigen mimicry48 (Supplementary Note 5 online). Rather, we hypothesize that an immunodominant antibody response to the highly exposed globular head may overwhelm the antibody response to the F10 epitope, although it remains possible that other immune exclusion mechanism(s) may preclude natural antibody responses against it. It is not surprising that many viruses are highly adept at keeping their most crucial (and conserved) determinants of pathogenesis cryptic, in which case subunit-based vaccines, using properly presented fragments of F10 or F10-like epitopes, may offer distinct advantages over whole virus\u2013based approaches to induce broad spectrum nAbs in vivo49,50.",

We show that they inhibit the post-attachment fusion process by recognizing a highly conserved epitope within the stem region of hemagglutinin at a point where key elements of the conformational change are brought into close apposition. Our initial experiments suggest that this region is recalcitrant to the generation of escape mutants. The prospects for their use for passive immunotherapy would therefore seem to be excellent, either alone or in combination with small-molecule inhibitors (Supplementary Note 6 online). Finally, our structural work pinpoints the reasons why group 2 hemagglutinins do not bind the nAbs described here: despite surface sequence similarities, they form a structurally distinct group, but one that is also highly conserved and therefore may be amenable to a similar panning discovery approach.",
