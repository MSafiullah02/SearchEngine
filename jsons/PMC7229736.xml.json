            "text": "A new infectious disease, namely CoViD-19, was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China (CSSE, 2020) caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) (Zhu et al., 2020). CoViD-19 has then rapidly spread around the world and was declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). As of 14th April 2020, around two million people have contracted the disease, and over 125 thousand deaths have been attributed to CoViD-19 globally (CSSE, 2020). The outbreak has triggered the so-called \u201cpandemic pantries\u201d, a term that well defines the spikes in stockpiling of emergency supplies all around the world. Among these supplies, stocks of hand sanitisers have rapidly vanished from some markets, as soon as the frequent handwashing and sanitisation was recommended by the public health agencies across the world. According to a market research from Nielsen, the sale of hand sanitisers skyrocketed by 300% and 470% in the last week of February and first week of March 2020, respectively, in comparison to the same time in the previous year (Huddleston, 2020). Similarly, in Italy \u2013 one of the most affected countries by CoViD-19 - sales of hand sanitisers in supermarkets augmented by 561% during the first three weeks of the pandemic (24th February-15th March 2020) compared to the previous year (Ufficio Studi Coop, 2020). There have been reports across the world that supermarkets and pharmacies, as well as hospitals and other healthcare facilities, have been running out of hand sanitisers.",

            "text": "A search in Google Trends enables to understand the magnitude of the emergent interest of the general public in hand sanitisers. Google Trends analyse and compare the search volume of given keywords on Google. Fig. 1\nA shows the trend of the search of the keyword \u201chand sanitizer\u201d (American English spelling) within the United States. A fairly constant volume of Google searches on this topic was shown until February 2020, when a massive spike of 100-fold increase in interest in \u201chand sanitizer\u201d appeared. This finding correlated with the increased search of the word \u201cCoViD-19\u201d, hinting the obvious relationship between the two terms. To put these numbers into context, comparison between the search on \u201chand sanitizer\u201d to that of the words \u201cpill\u201d, \u201cdrug\u201d and \u201cmedicine\u201d was done in Fig. 1B. Results show that before the spread of the new coronavirus, these words were constantly googled 25\u201350 times more frequently than \u201chand sanitizers\u201d, while during the peak of the pandemic (March 2020), \u201chand sanitizers\u201d was searched approximately twice as much as those keywords. Although, the astonishing peak of searches on \u201chand sanitizer\u201d is moderately tapering down, it is expected that the interest in this topic will remain much higher than the pre-pandemic levels, because, until a vaccine against CoViD-19 will be made available, hand sanitisation will remain at the forefront of infection prevention measures. Moreover, it is reasonable to speculate that the current awareness of the general public of the importance of hand disinfection will remain assimilated and will become an integral part of people\u2019s hygiene practices, even post-CoViD-19 era.",

As academics and pharmacists working in pharmaceutical technology departments of schools of pharmacy, we have received a high number of requests related to hand sanitisers, spanning from other faculties and businesses requesting the production of hand sanitisers in our laboratories, to pharmacists asking for advice on the compounding of such products. Indeed, hand sanitisers can also be prepared extemporaneously in pharmacies; however, pharmacists need an appropriate formulation and manufacturing directions to ensure a consistent product with adequate quality. Consumer habits and patterns are rapidly reshaping under the CoViD-19 crisis (McKenzie, 2020) and the unprecedented demand of hand sanitisers is likely to remain as the \u201cnew normal\u201d for an extended period of time. We, therefore, aim to provide in this article a technical perspective on the functionality and development of alcohol-based hand sanitiser formulations.",

            "text": "Overall, the application of ABHRs remains more versatile, convenient, quick and less irritating than hand washing with soap and water (Edmonds et al., 2012). For the general public, the CDC suggests washing the hands with soap and water, rather than to use the ABHR, whenever possible. This is because hand washing can virtually remove all types of pathogens, while the hand sanitiser can effectively kill 99.9% of germs (e.g. less effective with Cryptosporidium, norovirus, and Clostridium difficile). Moreover, in case of extremely greasy or dirty hands, ABHR effectiveness is reduced due to poor penetration of the product through the layer of dirt in soiled hands. In contrast, the detergents in a hand wash enable deeper cleaning and higher removal of germs. Moreover, potentially harmful substances can only be washed by a soap and water rather than hand sanitisation using ABHRs. However, handwashing facilities are not readily available at work or public places. Moreover, in instances where hand sensitisation is needed more frequently, such as during frequent contact with individuals or products, the ABHRs are the most effective and convenient infection preventive measure (CDC, 2019a, Hadaway, 2020). It is however important to emphasise that ABHRs only work when used correctly. Thus, considering that not all ABHR formulations are the same, appropriate labelling is important in directing the correct dose/amount needed to achieve an adequate sanitisation (Hadaway, 2020). The choice of container, closure and dispenser is also vital in dispensing the correct amount of the sanitiser on each use.",

In a recent article, Jansen has examined the evidence on disinfectants efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 (Jansen, 2020). It was noted that definitive claims on the effectivity of various disinfectants against SARS-CoV-2 cannot be made, simply because this is a new virus and the range of off-the-shelf ABHRs has never been tested for SARS-CoV-2. Like other respiratory viruses, the new coronavirus is known to spread mainly from person-to-person through airborne droplets (CDC, 2020). Moreover, the information about the virus survival on surfaces and the environment is still limited (Jansen, 2020). It has, however, been indicated that SARS-CoV-2 can also be transmitted through surfaces, as it can survive for a long period of time on various materials; for instance, the virus remains stable on plastic and stainless steel for 2\u20133 days (van Doremalen et al., 2020). This implies that anyone touching infected surfaces can potentially contact and spread the virus (Jansen, 2020). It is in this context that hand disinfection becomes highly crucial.",

Remarkably, both ethanol and 2-propanol, individually, could kill the virus within 30 s at a minimal final concentration of \u2265 30% (authors did not specify the concentration units). This provides a strong evidence to support the use of ABHR amid the CoViD-19 outbreak. Efficacy of alcohols in hand sanitisation is also dependent on various other factors, such as the quantity applied to the hands (the dose), the exposure time, and the application/rubbing technique.",

It has been argued that rubbing time is significantly affected by various other factors such as the dose of the sanitiser, the hand size (application surface area), and the formulation itself. Wilkinson et al. (2017) reported that drying time was strongly associated with the dose and hand surface area. The evaporation rates of alcoholic ingredients may vary in gel and liquid-based sanitisers and may directly correlate to the time when hands start to feel dry after application. This can, therefore, directly influence healthcare professionals\u2019 perception of the sufficient rubbing time (Kenters et al., 2020).",

In another study, ABHRs containing glycerin were found to increase skin hydration, but also to decrease the surface pH and superficial sebum content on the skin, although not to an extent to compromise the skin barrier function (Ahmed-Lecheheb et al., 2012). A very high concentration of glycerin can also have detrimental effects, as it can slow down the drying time and can increase the sticky sensation on the skin (especially if large or repeated doses are used) (Greenaway et al., 2018, Houben et al., 2006). Glycerol can lower the bactericidal activity of ABHRs when used at a concentration of 1.45% (v/v) (Suchomel et al., 2013). Reducing glycerol content to concentrations of 0.50%\u22120.73% has been proposed as the best compromise in maintaining antimicrobial activity, while still offering the needed skin protection (Menegueti et al., 2019, Suchomel et al., 2017).",

Aloe Vera gel can be used in combination with glycerol and propylene glycol to improve their water evaporation retardation effect. At high concentrations (i.e., \u226525%), Aloe Vera gel can also contribute to the firmness of formulations (Meadows, n.d.).

We only tested hand sanitisers from a single pack taken from a single batch for each product. The general behaviour of all the products is reported in Fig. 2\nand Table 1\n. As expected, most of the ABHRs exhibited a shear-thinning behaviour, as typical of polymeric dispersions. The only exception was the product containing HEC which resembled the Newtonian behaviour and exhibited very low viscosity. Noteworthy, the product containing HEC also showed white precipitates settled on the bottom, which on shaking resulted in a cloudy system. All the other alcoholic gels containing carbomer had a characteristic plastic behaviour (refer to Table 1 for the yield stress values) with a strong shear rate dependency (power law index < 0.5 in Table 1). All the carbomer-thickened gels showed almost superimposable viscosity profiles except for \u201cApoteke T\u2019igienizzo\u201d and \u201cSteriman Gel\u201d, which were characterised by a lower consistency. Finally, the only product containing HPMC showed the typical behaviour of a weak gel, characterised by pseudo-plasticity and a moderate shear rate dependency (power law index almost double compared to carbomer gel, but still much lower than 1). Interestingly, the HPMC-based gel exhibited a viscosity similar to that of the carbomer-based gels at the higher shear rates.",

Carbomers differ by the cross-linker and its density, and the solvent used during their polymerisation. Based on the cross-linker type, carbomers can be grouped into carbomer homopolymers (acrylic acid crosslinked with allyl sucrose or allyl pentaerythritol), carbomer copolymers (acrylic acid and C10-C30 alkyl acrylate crosslinked with allyl pentaerythritol), and carbomer interpolymers (carbomer homopolymer or copolymer that contains a block copolymer of polyethylene glycol and a long chain alkyl acid ester). For each category, the cross-linking density can be low, medium, or high, providing polymers with a varying ability to increase the viscosity of aqueous systems. The \u201ctraditional\u201d carbomers are still synthesised in benzene, a toxic solvent that cannot be used for pharmaceutical applications. The pharmaceutical-grade carbomers are synthesised in either ethyl acetate or a mixture of ethyl acetate and cyclohexane.

When carbomers are used for thickening of ethanol, isopropanol or hydroalcoholic mixtures (like in hand sanitisers), the neutraliser must be selected carefully to avoid the precipitation of the polymer.

            "text": "HEC is a non-ionic partially substituted poly(hydroxyethyl) ether of cellulose, available under the trade name of Natrosol\u2122 (Ashland) or Cellosize (Dow). It is prepared by the reaction of ethylene oxide with cellulose in the presence of sodium hydroxide under controlled conditions. Each glucose unit of the cellulose backbone contains three hydroxyl groups capable of reaction. If all three hydroxyl groups of each glucose residue react, the theoretical degree of substitution (DS) would be 3, although this is not practically achievable. The introduced hydroxyethyl groups can, indeed, react again with the free ethylene oxide at basic conditions, giving a side chain containing a different number of hydroxyethyl groups. To account for this, the total molar substitution (MS) describes the average number of ethylene oxide molecules attached to each glucose residue. HEC with DS and MS of 1.5 and 2.5 respectively, is known as Natrosol\u2122 250. Natrosol\u2122 250 is available in a range of molecular weight grades (L, M, H, HH) differing in their aqueous viscosity, where the L, M, H, HH refers to low, medium, high and very high viscosity, respectively. Furthermore, the pharmaceutical-grade of the product is indicated by the abbreviation Pharm, whereas the cosmetic grade is indicated by the abbreviation CS (Aqualon, 2000, Ashland, 2018b). HEC is easily dissolved in cold or hot water, but unlike other cellulosic derivatives, it is insoluble in organic solvents. The low or medium molecular weight types are fully soluble in glycerol and have a good solubility in hydroalcoholic media containing up to 60% ethanol (Ashland, 2018b). Specifically, the manufacturer indicates that HEC is \u201csoluble\u201d in a 70:30 water/ethanol mixture and partially soluble in a 40:60 water/ethanol mixture, both at 25 \u00b0C and 60 \u00b0C (Ashland, 2018b).",

The viscosity of aqueous dispersions increases with increasing the concentration and molecular weight (MW) of HEC used. For instance, at a concentration of 2% w/w, the viscosity increases from around 20 mPa\u00b7s for L-type polymer up to around 100,000 mPa\u00b7s for HH-type. The manufacturer does not provide further information regarding the viscosity of HEC dispersions in hydroalcoholic mixtures (Aqualon, 2000). Brown et al. measured and compared the elastic modulus G\u2019 of 3% HEC (the type was not specified) dispersions in water and in hydroalcoholic mixtures containing up to 60% ethanol. The measured G\u2019 was 354 Pa in water. The consistency of the dispersion reached a maximum at 30% ethanol (470 Pa), then decreased again at 40% or higher ethanolic concentrations. The viscosity dropped to 229 Pa in 60% ethanol due to poor hydration of the polymer in less aqueous media (Brown et al., 1998). Therefore, high molecular weight HEC (1\u20132%) could be suitable for the preparation of hand rub gels containing 50\u201360% ethanol. HEC gel formulations containing >60% alcohol are not recommended, due to the poor solubility of the polymer and the cloudy appearance that results, as shown in Fig. SF2 (supplementary information). Since 60\u201395% ethanol is necessary for efficient hand disinfection, HEC does not seem to be a suitable viscosity enhancer for ABHRs.",

CMC is made by the reaction of cellulose with sodium monochloroacetate in the presence of sodium hydroxide under strictly controlled conditions (Feddersen and Thorp, 1993). CMC is available from Ashland under the tradenames Aqualon\u2122 CMC and Blanose\u2122 CMC, depending on the site of production; and by other manufacturers with trade names such as Tylose CB and Walocel C. As for the other cellulose derivatives, the physical properties of CMC can be varied by the DS and MW. CMC is typically offered in three different DS such as 0.7, 0.9 and 1.2 (referred to as CMC type 7, 9 and 12) and a broad range of molecular weights indicated by the letter L (low), M (medium) and H (high). The regulatory classification is given by the letters \u201cF\u201d for food; \u201cCS\u201d for cosmetic; and \u201cPH\u201d for pharmaceutical compliance, according to US, European (EU) and Japanese (J) pharmacopoeia (Ashland, 2012).",

It is practically insoluble in most organic solvents, including ethanol (95%). However, it can be dispersed providing clear systems in hydroalcoholic mixtures of up to 40% ethanol. At higher contents (up to 60% ethanol), CMC can be dispersed, but it provides opaque systems. Low-viscosity grades work better with alcoholic gels than high-viscosity types, which show clouding and polymer precipitation at higher ethanol content. The manufacturer does not provide any information regarding the effect of ethanol on the viscosity of the dispersions (Feddersen and Thorp, 1993). The only reference available is from Brown et al. who compared the viscosity of 10% CMC (the type and MW is not specified) in pure water and hydroalcoholic mixtures (up to 40% ethanol). A remarkable increase in the viscosity was observed from pure water (G\u2019 432 Pa) to a mixture containing 30% ethanol (G\u20191186 Pa), followed by a drop (G\u2019 671 Pa) at 40% ethanol which may be attributed to the poor solubility of CMC in higher alcoholic media (Brown et al., 1998). According to the literature, low viscosity CMC (being more stable in ethanol) is more suitable for the preparation of gels with a maximum ethanol concentration of 50%. In our experience, it was found that CMC dispersions precipitate and become opaque at 60% (w/w) ethanolic concentrations (Fig. F3, supplementary information). It is therefore not advisable to use CMC for ABHRs containing higher ethanol concentrations recommended for optimum germicide efficacy.",

            "text": "In the direct addition method, all the components, except for the thickener, have to be preliminarily solubilised in the water/ethanol mixture. Then, the thickener is added, preferentially sifted slowly, in the vortex of the vigorously agitated hydroalcoholic solution (with mechanical or magnetic stirring) (Aqualon, 2000, KlucelTM hydroxypropylcellulose, 2017, Lubrizol, 1998). For carbomer thickeners, it is necessary to raise the pH to around 6.5\u20137 with the neutralising agent. The neutralising agent has to be added dropwise or gradually after the complete dispersion of the polymer, possibly monitoring the pH with a pH-meter (using electrodes suitable for measuring viscous or dirty samples) or a pH-indicator paper. Gel preparation using this procedure is faster with the surface-treated grades of thickeners such as Carbopol\u00ae Ultrez types for carbomer or Natrosol R-grades for HPC, due to the low lumpiness of these polymers when dispersed [for carbomer Ultrez grades the direct method should be slightly modified - for more details readers are referred to (Lubrizol, 1998)]. Also, all carbomer thickeners are faster to disperse than the others due to their pH-dependent viscosity. They remain in the liquid phase during product preparation until the pH is adjusted to neutral. This is an advantage as solvent diffusion and polymer hydration are much more rapid in liquid state than in an already formed gel system. On the other hand, the direct addition method can be slower and more difficult for HPMC and HPC gels (even for surface-treated grades), due to their high tendency to form lumps during dispersion. The direct addition method is a very effective and economical procedure, as long as an efficient stirring system is available for production.",

The wetting procedure is usually operated using mortar and pestle. When a homogenous wet slurry is obtained, the hydroalcoholic solution (containing all the other components previously dissolved) can be gradually added, always under vigorous stirring with the pestle. The addition of the neutralising agent for carbomer polymers follows the same procedure reported in the direct addition method.

The only exceptions were represented by two products thickened by either HPMC or HEC; and a third product in which carbomer neutralised by sodium hydroxide was used. Interestingly, these three hand gels were among the ones on which we performed the rheological analysis (Table 1), whereby they showed different rheological behaviour compared to most other analysed products. The product containing HEC was practically liquid, with a white precipitate at the bottom, that could be explained by a decreased polymer solubility at high ethanolic concentration. Indeed, the manufacturer of HEC indicates that this polymer possesses good solubility in hydroalcoholic media containing up to 60% ethanol (Ashland, 2018b), hinting at a decrease in polymer solubility at higher ethanolic concentrations. As for the carbomer gel neutralised with sodium hydroxide, it was slightly opaque and less viscous compared to the majority of the carbomer products (Table 1). Noteworthily, sodium hydroxide is not recommended as a suitable neutralising agent for carbomer-based hydroalcoholic gels by the manufacturer, due to possible polymer precipitation (Lubrizol, 2002), as stated earlier. Therefore, it can be concluded that the standard combination of carbomer/amine-based neutralising agents seems to form a product with good gel quality.",

While if the use of the product aims at disinfecting the skin from potentially infectious organisms, or if the action of the product goes beyond the general use of personal hygiene, then the hand sanitiser should follow the Biocidal Products Regulation. The marketing authorisation procedures and labelling requirements significantly differ between the two regulatory pathways. Specifically, a biocide has to be authorised by a competent authority (National Health Authority or European Commission) after the evaluation of a dossier containing all the information regarding the safety and effectiveness of the product. The product label must report the concentration of the \u201cactive ingredient\u201d (including alcohol), the uses for which the product is authorised including all warnings, hazard and precautionary statements. On the other hand, evidence of safety is the key requirement for a cosmetic product. For the market authorisation, the company has to notify the Product Information File (PIF) to the cosmetic products notification portal (CPNP), which makes the information electronically available to competent authorities or poison centres. The product label must contain the list of ingredients (in descending order of weight), particular precautions or warnings and the cosmetic activity unless it is clear from its presentation.",

            "text": "This implies that the biocide and cosmetic hand rubs can have different amounts of ethanol in the products. All alcohol gels in Table 2 commercialised as biocides report the ethanol concentration in the label, which is always in the range 60% to 95%, suggested as a safe and effective concentration for disinfection by the US FDA and WHO (Boyce et al., 2009, FDA, U.S., 1994). Conversely, reporting the concentration of ethanol is not mandatory for cosmetic sanitisers. Of the 13 alcoholic gels approved as cosmetics, the amount of ethanol is reported only in 5 products, where one contained only 50% alcohol. Surprisingly, in three products water is listed as the first ingredient followed by ethanol, suggesting an ethanolic concentration of even <50% (by weight). Such cosmetic products, although good for cleaning the skin, are not fit for use as disinfectants. This can be misleading for the general public, as they might not be aware of the product suitability amid the CoViD-19 pandemic. Consumers aiming to buy an effective hand disinfectant might unintentionally pick up from the shelves a very similar hand gel product, which is however not a disinfectant (i.e. a cosmetic). It is crucial, in this context, that pharmacists and retailers promptly advise customers to choose the appropriate product for the right purpose, i.e. disinfection or simple cleaning. Overall, during a pandemic, providing consumers with the correct information on hand sanitisers should be a priority of utmost importance. Perhaps, also regulatory agencies could consider revisiting the current regulations to better safeguard consumers.",

            "text": "In response to the health, habits and market patterns extreme changes brought about by the current CoViD-19 outbreak, we review here the current knowledge and trends on the formulation of hand rubs. The article also presents a detailed guide on ingredients\u2019 selection, and formulation design and manufacture of quality hand sanitisers. The main outcomes of the analysis presented in this review are listed below:\u2022Evidences show that hand sanitisation is a main infection preventive measure during a pandemic, justifying the emphasis by the various healthcare organisations across the world, the huge increase in sales witnessed during the CoVid-19 outbreak, and the consequent shortage of hand sanitisers. The European Commission has recently highlighted the tendency of many economic operators to consider the possibility to shift and/or increase the production of hand cleaners and disinfectants to respond to the current needs (European commission, 2020). Businesses producing hand sanitisers and compounding pharmacists are now challenged to keep up with the exceptionally high demand for such products.\u2022Most gel formulations contain carbomers and an amine-based neutralising agent to form the gel matrix. Other gelling polymers could also be used, in theory, as alternatives; however, such polymers do not often provide hydroalcoholic gel products of the same ideal rheological behaviour and appearance, touch feel, ease of use and stability. Carbomer remains, in our opinion, the gold standard gel former in alcohol-based hand sanitisers.\u2022Substandard products can be available in certain markets. When the low standard is related to the selection of less appropriate excipients or formulation procedures, but the alcoholic concentration is maintained between the accepted standard of disinfection (i.e. 60\u201395% for ethanol), the risk for consumers is mainly a reduced perception of product quality and attractiveness, and reduced ease of use; while overall product efficacy is maintained. The poorly formulated products may also be subject to inappropriate use and sanitisation technique.\u2022Much more worrying is the presence of hand cleaners on the market containing low (\u201csubstandard\u201d) and/or unknown concentrations of alcohol that are not commercialised as disinfectants. There is a tangible risk that consumers might, and are using, hand cleaners, which product appearance is very similar to hand disinfectants, while being unaware that such products cannot ensure disinfection and are not fit for use amid the CoViD-19 pandemic. To minimise this risk: 1) customer counselling by pharmacists and retailers regarding the selection of appropriate products for CoViD-19 infection control is highly necessary; 2) online purchase of hand sanitiser from unknown or unreliable e-commerce sites by the public is discouraged; 3) awareness campaigns to educate the public on discriminating between products fit for general hygiene/cleansing from those for disinfection fit the for CoViD-19 infection control should be promoted; and finally, 4) regulatory bodies should revisit current regulations on hand sanitisers to better safeguard consumers.\u2022The demand for the hand sanitisers amid the CoViD-19 pandemic is likely to remain high for long, until more efficient infection preventive measures become available, such as a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Moreover, public awareness on the importance of hand sanitisation during this pandemic is likely to have long term effects on hygiene habits across the world. The public is likely to endure the routine use of hand sanitisers, even beyond the CoViD-19 era, as a new norm of self-hygiene.\n",
