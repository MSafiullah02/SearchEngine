Claudins are necessary and sufficient for the formation of tight junctions by homophilic and heterophilic binding to adjacent cells.12, 13 Regarding hereditary diseases, mutations of the claudin\u20101 gene cause neonatal sclerosing cholangitis with ichthyosis.14 Those of claudin\u201014 cause deafness.15 Some claudins are expected to form extracellular aqueous pores in paracellular spaces.16, 17 Distinct examples are claudin\u201016/paracellin\u2010118 and claudin\u201019,19 which are responsible for hereditary hypomagnesemia. Similarly, claudins are considered to form selective channels in tight junctions because of the existence of charged amino acids on the first extracellular loop.17 Several claudins are expressed in one cell.1, 2 Their regulation is very complicated, as it is both claudin\u2010specific and cell\u2010specific. Claudin\u20101, \u20106 and \u20109 are reported to be required for the entry of hepatitis C virus (HCV) into hepatocytes after binding of HCV to CD81.20 Claudins have been reported to recruit and promote the activation of pro\u2010MMP\u20102.21, 22 Claudin\u20107, however, is reported to suppress expression of MMP\u20103.23 In addition, claudin\u20107 interacts with Ep\u2010CAM24 and, in claudin\u20107\u2010deficient mice, expression of integrin \u03b12 is reduced and its localization altered in the intestinal epithelia.23 These findings show that some claudins play as yet unknown roles in cellular processes other than tight junction functions.",

Immediately thereafter, ZO\u20101 and JAM\u2010A are recruited at spot\u2010like primordial adherens junctions, and then Par3, Par6 and aPKC are recruited to JAM\u2010A, and occludin and claudin are also recruited to ZO\u20101 complexes. Lastly, by unknown mechanisms probably involving an aPKC/Par complex and delivery of the integral membrane proteins, tight junctions are segregated from adherens junctions. Consistently, during polarization of mouse teratoma cell line F9, HNF\u20104\u03b1 plays crucial roles in the formation of tight junctions43 as well as adherens junctions.44 Furthermore HNF\u20104\u03b1 induces formation of microvilli on the apical surface.45 These findings show that formation of tight junctions is very closely related to the establishment of cell polarity.",

In this context, dendritic cells residing between epithelial cells express occludin, claudin\u20101 and ZO\u20101, sending their dendrites outside through paracellular spaces in the colonic epithelium, probably to sample antigens in the intestine.55 A similar relationship between dendritic cells and epithelial cells has been observed in the nasal mucosa,56 and the epidermis.57 These findings imply that dendritic cells may pass through intercellular spaces by using tight junction molecules to sense extrinsic noxious molecules.",

Recent studies have disclosed that claudins are the major determinant of the barrier function of tight junctions. Importantly, the first extracellular loop, in which there is a wide variation in the position and number of charged amino acids depending on each claudin, is known to create paracellular pores (channels) for cations or anions between neighboring cells.13 The expression of putative cation\u2010permissive claudin\u20102, \u20107, \u201012 and \u201015 in the intestine of vitamin D receptor\u2010deficient mice was compared to that of wild mice,77 clearly showing a decrease of claudin\u20102 and \u201012.

Since tight junctions are located at the apicalmost areas of basolateral spaces between epithelial, endothelial or mesothelial cells, they are involved in a wide variety of pathological conditions where the physiological regulation of the passage of ions, molecules, and inflammatory cells may be affected. In Table 2, human diseases involving dysfunction of tight junctions are listed. Inflammation is always accompanied by an increase in vascular permeability, in part caused by VEGF, which primarily affects the barrier function of tight junctions via both phosphorylation and down\u2010regulation of occluding.95, 96 Cancer cells also secrete VEGF to induce angiogenesis, presumably to intravasate and extravasate, in other words, to metastasize. Thus, various diseases in which VEGF production is involved may cause tight junction dysfunction. To a greater or lesser degree, many cytokines affect the functions of tight junctions under pathological conditions.",

He proposed the field of Barriology, based on the barrier function of tight junctions. Until recently, research on tight junctions was exclusively on the fence and barrier functions at the cellular level. Now it is becoming clear that tight junctions are deeply involved in immunity. However, the study of this issue is still in the early stage. With advances in this area, tight junction research may contribute to the development of drugs, vaccination and drug delivery systems. Further extensive study is required to clarify the issues concerning tight junction functions.5 On the other hand, each of the tight junction proteins, in particular each of the claudins, may play distinct roles in cell biology in addition to the formation of tight junctions.
