In the same week, a patient with a recent history of travel to the United Kingdom (UK) for medical care for severe pneumonia and acute kidney injury, was reported to have the same coronavirus (Wise, 2012). A retrospective investigation of an outbreak of pneumonia among 13 patients that took place in Jordan in April 2012 revealed that the cases were caused by the same virus (Al-Abdallat et al., 2014). Subsequently, many cases and clusters of infection with the same virus were reported (see epidemiology below). The novel virus was first called HCoV-EMC, after the Erasmus Medical Center, where it was first identified (Zaki et al., 2012) but it was subsequently named MERS-CoV reflecting the fact that the majority of cases were from the Arabian Peninsula (de Groot et al., 2013).",

            "text": "MERS cases occur as sporadic cases or as clusters or hospital outbreaks. The first large hospital outbreak of MERS-CoV occurred in April 2013, in a single hospital in Al-Hasa, Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia, where a cluster of 23 confirmed cases and 11 probable cases were detected (Assiri et al., 2013b). A large surge in the number of reported cases occurred in March and April 2014, reaching to more than 500 cases. Most of those reported cases were part of hospital outbreaks in different cities in Saudi Arabia and Al Ain, United Arab Emirates. The largest hospital outbreaks occurred in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia with 255 laboratory-confirmed MERS cases (Oboho et al., 2015). Another hospital outbreak occurred in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia with 45 laboratory-confirmed cases (Fagbo et al., 2015). The first report of MERS-CoV from North America was in April 2014 for a physician who worked in Saudi Arabia and started to have symptoms after returning to the United States (Kapoor et al., 2014). Another imported case to the United States was confirmed in Florida in May 2014 (The Florida Department of Health, 2018, Dec 10). In May 2015, a large outbreak occurred in South Korea. The index case was a 68-year-old Korean patient who had recently come from a business trip to the Arabian Peninsula (that included Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates and Qatar). This index case resulted in infection among 26 patients who further spread the infection nationwide, leading to a total of 186 MERS cases across 16 hospitals with 36 deaths (19.3% case fatality rate) (Ki, 2015). One month later, in July 2015, another large hospital outbreak took place in a large tertiary care center in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia with 130 cases and 51 deaths (39.25% case fatality rate) (Stone et al., 2016). A subsequent outbreak occurred in Jordan in August 2015, with 16 cases across three hospitals, and seven deaths (43.7% case fatality rate) (Payne et al., 2018). Smaller outbreaks continued to occur in 2016\u201318 although the number of patients and the magnitude of the outbreaks were less compared to earlier years, presumably due to better infection control practices and earlier identification of cases.",

A study from Saudi Arabia, a phylogenetically MERS-CoV identical short gene segment, was detected in a fecal sample of one of the 29 captured bats near the home of a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV patient (Memish et al., 2013a). However, live MERS-CoV has never been recovered from bats. Further studies are needed to further establish the role of bats in transmission to humans including larger surveillance studies with full viral genome sequencing. Epidemiologically, it seems unlikely that bats are the direct source of human cases, since none of the community-acquired laboratory-confirmed MERS cases had clear bat exposure.",

            "text": "Dromedary camels are thought to be a host for MERS-CoV. Direct contact with dromedary camels within 14 days prior to infection was identified as an independent risk factor for MERS (Gossner et al., 2016). Camel-human transmission was also suggested in a 44-year-old, previously healthy man from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia who was admitted to the intensive care Unit (ICU) with severe MERS pneumonia, and died 15 days after admission. The patient had owned a herd of 9 camels and used to visit them daily until 3 days prior to his admission. Four out of the nine camels were sick with nasal discharge, 1 week prior to the patient's onset of symptoms. The patient had significant contact with camels\u2019 excretions. Respiratory specimens from the patient and one of his camels showed identical MERS-CoV full genome sequencing. Moreover, serum antibodies for MERS-CoV were positive in both the patient and the camel, with the camel seropositivity preceded the patient's seropositivity suggesting that direction of transmission was from the camel to the patient. A large cross-sectional study from Saudi Arabia identified MERS-CoV infected patients who had a history of camel contact. The investigators obtained nasal swabs and serum samples from 584 dromedary camels and found that 12.6% of the studied camels were MERS-CoV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive, and 70.9% of them were MERS-CoV antibodies positive. Furthermore, 10 of the full genome sequences of the camel MERS-CoV were identical to their contacted patients (Kasem et al., 2018). This data suggests an important role for camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV. However, in a cohort of 1125 patients with laboratory-confirmed MERS, camel contact was reported only in 235 patients (20.9%), denied by 276 patients (24.5%), and not reported in the other 614 patients (54.6%) (Conzade et al., 2018).",

The transmission was more commonly observed in healthcare-based outbreaks, compared to community clusters. The number of close contacts who got infected by patients with confirmed MERS-CoV appears to be low, although, it was evident that some patients were spreading the infection to a disproportionally large number of individuals (super spreaders) (Hui, 2016). This phenomenon was clearly described in more than one outbreak. The first outbreak which identified the super spreader phenomena was the Korean outbreak, in which a single imported index case resulted in a total of 186 cases. It was thought that 83% of transmission in the Korean outbreak was linked epidemiologically to five super spreaders (Korea Centers for Disease and Prevention, 2015) The same phenomenon was also described in a large outbreak in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where 6 out of the 130 cases, contributed to 58.7% of the transmission (Alenazi et al., 2017).

Environmental surfaces in hospitals is a potential source of transmission.

Like the other coronaviruses, it is an enveloped single-stranded RNA virus which replicates in the host-cell cytoplasm. The size of Its RNA genome is approximately 30 kb. It has structural proteins, called the E, M, and N proteins, and membrane protein called the Spike (S) protein, which plays an important role in the virus attachment and entry into the host cells.",

In one case-control study of patients with MERS, the rescue use of ECMO compared to a matched control with no-ECMO was associated with reduced in-hospital-mortality (65% compared 100%) (Alshahrani et al., 2018). Another retrospective study, found that critically ill healthcare workers who died because of MERS were more likely to have received ECMO than not, probably because the severity of pneumonia that led to use of rescue therapy, rather than use of ECMO itself (Shalhoub et al., 2018). Corticosteroids have been used frequently in MERS patients. A study that accounted for time-varying confounding demonstrated that corticosteroid use was not associated with difference on mortality although it was associated with prolongation of viral RNA shedding (Arabi et al., 2018b).",

Similar findings were observed in rhesus macaques model of MERS-CoV infection. Among animals who received combination of ribavirin and interferon alpha 2 b 8 hours after inoculation did not develop respiratory symptoms and had no or very minimal chest x-ray findings of infiltrate compared to the control group. Also, the treated group had a moderately lower viral genome copies and fewer severe lung histopathological changes (Falzarano et al., 2013b). Data on humans are based on retrospective studies. In retrospective cohort of 20 patients with severe MERS-CoV pneumonia, ribavirin and interferon combination therapy started at median day three after diagnosis, showed improved 14-day survival, compared to 24 patients who received only supportive therapy, however 28-day survival was not different between the 2 groups (Omrani et al., 2014). Other retrospective studies showed no difference in mortality between patients treated with ribavirin interferon combination, and patients who received supportive therapy (Al-Tawfiq et al., 2014; Shalhoub et al., 2015). The largest cohort study which adjusted for time-varying confounders showed that ribavirin with interferons (alpha 1a and 1b and beta 1a) was not associated with difference in mortality or viral shedding.

As per the WHO recommendations, patients who have probable or confirmed MERS should be under contact and droplet precautions with eye protection. The patient should be under airborne precaution, when performing an aerosol generating procedure (AGP) like tracheal intubation or bronchoscopy. The US CDC, on the other hand, recommends contact and airborne precautions for all suspected or confirmed MERS-CoV patients.
