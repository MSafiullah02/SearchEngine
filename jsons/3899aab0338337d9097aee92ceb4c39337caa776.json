The most important alert is that, in addition to variable incubation period, signs and 23 symptoms of infection often coincide with normal postoperative ones making realistic a delay of about 24 8 and 4 days for suspicious of viral pneumonia and confirmed diagnosis. It should be particularly 25 emphasized that 5/11 cases had misdiagnosis at first postoperative CT scan (7) (8). This implies delays 26 in treatment and greater risk of spreading the infection. We observed a similar pattern, and negative 27 outcomes, in our patients. All thoracic surgeons should be aware that the virus is present in the 28 community way before the official confirmation from healthcare authorities, thus vigilance is 29 mandatory.30 Another important point addressed is the attempt to identify prognostic factors. The main problem 31 remains the relatively poor specificity of blood count and clinical biochemistry changes. On the 32 contrary, significance of the number of resected segments, if confirmed, could be a very precious 33 indicator. Although anatomical lung resections are still the gold-standard for tumors larger than 2cm 34 one wonders if, in the period of pandemic, a risk-comparison between cancer recurrence vs increased 35 mortality due to COVID-19 infection is appropriate and if wedge resection should be consider. 36 These postoperative prognostic factors could be helpful in promptly identifying patients at greater risk 37and rapidly escalate treatments such as pre-emptive ITU admission. 38",
