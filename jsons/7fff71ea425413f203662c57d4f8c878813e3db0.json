            "text": "Radiographic images offer an alternative method for the rapid screening and monitoring of Coronavirus Disease 2019 patients. This approach is limited by the shortage of radiology experts who can provide a timely interpretation of these images. Motivated by this challenge, our paper proposes a novel learning architecture, called Detail-Oriented Capsule Networks (DECAPS), for the automatic diagnosis of COVID-19 from Computed Tomography (CT) scans. Our network combines the strength of Capsule Networks with several architecture improvements meant to boost classification accuracies. First, DECAPS uses an Inverted Dynamic Routing mechanism which increases model stability by preventing the passage of information from non-descriptive regions. Second, DECAPS employs a Peekaboo training procedure which uses a two-stage patch crop and drop strategy to encourage the network to generate activation maps for every target concept. The network then uses the activation maps to focus on regions of interest and combines both coarse and fine-grained representations of the data. Finally, we use a data augmentation method based on conditional generative adversarial networks to deal with the issue of data scarcity. Our model achieves 84.3% precision, 91.5% recall, and 96.1% area under the ROC curve, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods. We compare the performance of the DECAPS model with three experienced, well-trained thoracic radiologists and show that the architecture significantly outperforms them. While further studies on larger datasets are required to confirm this finding, our results imply that architectures like DECAPS can be used to assist radiologists in the CT scan mediated diagnosis of COVID-19.",

Early, accurate, and scalable technologies for the screening of patients and monitoring of their treatment progress are crucial for controlling this crisis. At the time of writing this paper, real-time Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR) is the most widely used approach for patient screening [1] . Patient specimens are usually collected from their nose or throat, and are then sent to laboratories to generate a diagnosis. The process is time-consuming, complicated, and limited by the supply of test kits, swabs, and test reagents, which has led to logistic challenges due to the large influx of patients.",

Recent studies show that CT scans of COVID-19 patients have typical features that can be recognized by doctors and artificial intelligence models [4, 2, 5] . While the role of radiographic images is still under discussion as the crisis unfolds [6] , they have several important advantages including fast turnaround time (e.g., 15 to 30 minutes for a CT scan) and wide availability at most hospitals. These advantages potentially make radiographic imaging techniques a great complementary tool to rRT-PCR testing with which to fight the COVID-19 pandemic [7, 8] .",

A new disease like COVID-19 with variable imaging manifestations requires radiologists to spend significant amounts of time to constantly update their knowledge and learn new interpretation skills. This becomes even more challenging in remote locations with insufficient access to training resources and poorlyequipped medical facilities. The inability to perform image interpretation for the diagnosis of the disease and assessment of disease severity make these remote regions of the country highly vulnerable when the disease strikes. In addition, the pandemic creates a large influx of patients which sharply increases the radiologists' workload. Addressing the shortage of radiology experts is critical to the diagnostic process and is needed to maximize the potential of radiographic imaging in the diagnosis of COVID-19.",

While the results are encouraging, it remains unclear how these models fare against well-trained human radiologists and how they derive their conclusions. Past work with deep learning has demonstrated that deep networks are competitive against human experts on a number of classification tasks for chest radiographs [15, 16] , CT scans [17] , and magnetic-resonance images [18] . However, the nature of these studies is significantly different from the one in this paper. In particular, while these studies use large-scale and carefully curated datasets, our study focuses on building artificial intelligence models from a modest and possibly noisy set of training examples. In addition, the pathological conditions in prior studies are well-established while COVID-19 is still a new disease whose characteristics have not been fully understood. Comparing the performance of artificial intelligence algorithms against human experts at the developing stage of a new disease is unique. It can potentially shed light on how well computer and human experts stand up to a new diagnostic challenge. Our results are expected to provide a more complete view of artificial intelligence algorithms, including their strengths and weaknesses in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The network achieves an overall accuracy of 86.7%.

Therefore, generating descriptive and realistic synthetic training samples serves as an enticing solution. Jin et al.

It would therefore be preferable to simulate this behavior by using a classification architecture that is capable of deriving conclusions about regions of interest with respect to the greater context of the image. To accomplish this, we propose the Detail Oriented Capsule Network (DECAPS) architecture, which uses two underlying concepts to replicate how a radiologist reviews each scan. First, we use a Capsule Network (CapsNet) classifier, which allows the architecture to intelligently combine information within and around a region of interest to generate a holistic interpretation of each scan. Second, we introduce the \"peekaboo\" training procedure which randomly retrieves or removes areas of interest in the image. When we pass the retrieved ROI and the entire scan through the classifier, the local classification power of the architecture is effectively increased by simulating the ability of the radiologist to consider the ROI with respect to the entire scan. Alternatively, we pass the whole scan with the ROI removed; this forces the classifier to recognize multiple ROIs when possible, thus enhancing its global classification power.",

This presents a unique challenge for researchers in how to best utilize their available data to generate robust and reliable models that are able to generalize to the patient population. While popular online augmentation techniques such as image flipping, rotation, and cropping help improve generalization, they fail to minimize the impact of otherwise irrelevant information that is coincidentally correlated to the classification labels. Unique image characteristics such as organ shapes, scan irregularities, and other morphologically irrelevant information can easily distract a classifier trained on a small sample of data, thus harming its ability to generalize. Considering the urgent need for the dependable and high-throughput diagnosis of COVID-19, we believe that leveraging intelligent data augmentation techniques that learn to identify and combine class specific features is fundamental to building an inexpensive but robust COVID-19 classifier. To accomplish this, we propose the use of conditional GANs as a means to model the distribution of the CT image data for each class; this allows us to then generate unique samples from the distribution that can then be passed to our desired classification architecture to improve its generalization ability.",

This can have a negative effect of the performance of the classifier; while some child capsules pass useful information from regions of interest, others pass noise derived from non-descriptive areas. To address this limitation, we implemented a unique CapsNet architecture, loss function, and inverted routing mechanism which increases the weight of votes derived from ROIs. This effectively improves the quality of the input information being passed to each parent, thus strengthening the networks ability to build part-whole relationships. Note that given the relatively small sample size of our dataset, we chose to utilize pose matrices to decrease the number of training parameters to prevent the early over-fitting that is associated with a large number of parameters [22] . We also took inspiration from the Transformers architecture described by Vaswani et al. and grouped capsules into grids called Capsule Heads, as shown in Fig. 1 (a) . Each capsule head is designed to route information to parent capsules independently of the other capsule heads; we encourage this by forcing each head to share a transformation matrix W L i j between all capsules for each output The distillation process to fine-tune the coarse-grained prediction (p coarse ) using the fine-grained prediction (p fine ) to obtain the final distilled predictions (p dist. ).",

Our strategy boosts the performance of DECAPS by forcing the network to look at all relevant parts for a given category, not just the most discriminative parts. It is inspired by the Hide and Seek [33] mechanism in which image patches are randomly dropped to encourage the network to look for other relevant parts. Peekaboo, however, uses the HAMs to guide the network's attention process. For each training image, we randomly select an activation map A i j for each recognized category. Each map is then normalized in the range [0, 1] to get the normalized HAM, A * i j \u2208 R h L \u00d7w L . We then enter a two step process: patch cropping, which extracts a fine-grained representation of the ROI to learn how to encode details, and patch dropping, which encourages the network to attend to multiple ROIs. In patch cropping, a mask M crop i j \u2208 R h L \u00d7w L is obtained by setting all elements of A * i j which are less than a cropping threshold \u03b8 c \u2208 [0, 1] to 0, and 1 otherwise. We then find the smallest bounding box which covers the entire ROI, and crop it from the raw image ( Fig. 1 (b) ). It is then upsampled and fed into the network to generate a detailed description of the ROI. During the patch dropping procedure, M drop i j is used to remove the ROI from the raw image by using a dropping threshold \u03b8 d \u2208 [0, 1]. The new patch-dropped image is then fed to the network for prediction. This encourages the network to train capsule heads to attend to multiple discriminative semantic patterns.

This architecture learns the mapping of both the input set (non-COVID-19 CT scans) and the output set (COVID-19 CT scans) by using a learned loss function, thus not requiring complex loss formulations. This allows us to learn the data distribution for each class; characteristics that make each class unique are effectively encoded and then sampled to create unique cases. We selected the pix2pix architecture due to its ability to retain stochasticity in the generated data, a feature that is lost in other conditional GAN architectures; this randomness is critical to the generation of unique cases that enrich our data. To accomplish this, we drew from the original implementation of pix2pix, substituting the Gaussian noise typically introduced in conditional GAN architectures with train-test dropout. Our generative model was also designed using the characteristic \"U-net\" architecture, where each layer i has a skip connection to layer n \u2212 i, with n being equal to the total number of layers [35] . This effectively prevents the network from minimizing the low-level information being passed, thus improving the overall quality of the output. Finally, we mitigate the negative effect the L1 loss has on image \"crispness\" by restricting the discriminative model's attention to local image patches (i.e. the PatchGAN architecture). This effectively allows us to model high-level information while relying on the L1 loss to force low-level correctness, thus modeling the images as a Markov random field (i.e. simulating style loss). Additionally, we note that the PatchGAN architecture significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters and can therefore be applied to larger images (such as full resolution CT scans).",

It would, therefore, be advantageous for hospitals to make use of resources that they already have; for instance, CT scans are used frequently to triage suspected COVID-19 patients. We were interested in developing a classification architecture that could improve upon the current state of the CT derived diagnostic performance in the context of COVID-19.

During a crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic, spending a significant amount of time to collect a well-vetted and large dataset is simply not feasible. This data scarcity is an important roadblock that must be rapidly surmounted to address the automation needs of the medical community in time. We were interested in leveraging the power of conditional GANs to help accomplish this; as has been shown in previous works, \"deep fakes\" could be used to increase the stochasticity of a dataset while retaining some underlying target concept. One can imagine that the generated samples resemble the examples produced by an educator; drawings from a medical textbook (while clearly fake) help to improve the understanding of the learning student. We found that the Image-to-Image (or pix2pix) architecture produced results that were consistent with what we observed in the COVID-19 CT dataset. To ensure that the generated samples captured the underlying concepts that distinguish COVID-19 scans from non-COVID-19 scans, we presented a small sample of the produced cases to three experienced radiologists (as shown in Fig. 3 ). While all three radiologists recognized that the samples were fake, each image was identified as having features consistent with COVID-19 by at least one of the physicians. Interestingly, they noted that several of the samples had features characteristic of other diseases (we refer to these cases as the \"artificial co-morbidity\" cases). For example, Fig. 3 (g) contains both tree-in-bud opacities in the left lung (blue circle, indicative of non-COVID-19) and ground glass and consolidation (red circles, indicative of COVID-19). Due to the positive effect these samples had on performance, we hypothesize that these cases helped to enforce the unique features of COVID-19 when training the DECAPS classifier.",

Being conscious of both the entire scan while focusing on a lesion (or lesions) of interest highlights the skill required for the accurate assessment of radiographic data. Most classification architectures are not designed to encourage this kind of behavior; typically, images are simply passed through the classification mechanism without explicitly being forced to consider details with respect to global information. The DECAPS architecture is designed to consider these relationships; it combines fine-grained and coarse information, generating classifications that are derived from the complex relationships between details and the big picture. Based on the generated performance metrics shown in Table 1 , we see that the DECAPS architecture succeeds in capturing the characteristics of COVID-19. The sharp increase in recall attributed to the DECAPS architecture implies that the classifier was able to achieve a relatively profound understanding of the features unique to COVID-19. Our ablation study also shows how each unique component in the architecture contributes to this understanding, eventually reaching an AUC value of 96.1% (as shown in Table 2 ). The advantages of this architecture are most evident when compared to the performance of three experienced radiologists; at a false positive rate of 15.64%, the top performing radiologist achieves a true positive rate of 85.11% while DECAPS+Peekaboo achieves a true positive rate of 95% (as shown in Fig. 4) . We also note that the performance of the radiologist consensus is better than that of 2 of the participating radiologists and worse than the best radiologist; at a 21.94% false positive rate, DECAPS+Peekaboo achieves a perfect true positive rate while the consensus achieves an 85.11% true positive rate.

We note that the classifier was sensitive to peripheral ground-glass opacities which are considered a hallmark of COVID-19 in thoracic CT scans ((5), (6), (9) , and (12) as examples). These results indicate that coupling the DECAPS architecture with the augmented dataset effectively addressed most of the underlying data scarcity issues. However, upon observation of sample (2), we note that the architecture used a seemingly normal vascular branch in the left lung to generate its correct COVID-19 classification. We hypothesize that the classifier mistook this feature as a linear band with adjacent ground-glass opacity, which would be indicative of late-stage COVID-19. Similarly, the architecture correctly detected a linear band with adjacent ground-glass opacity in sample (3) . It is important to note that the classifier did not \"cheat\" by using the annotation in the right lung of sample (2) that highlighted the peripheral ground-glass opacity, proving that the architecture was seeking COVID-19 specific information. Another important case to consider is sample (1); we note that the classifier focused on a fissure in the left lung (a normal anatomical feature) while simultaneously considering the linear band with adjacent ground-glass opacities from the right lung. As mentioned earlier with sample (2), we believe that the classifier mistook the fissure as a feature of COVID-19. Interestingly, upon further examination, one of the radiologists changed their diagnosis based on the features being highlighted in the right lung; this highlights the importance of incorporating information from multiple regions of the scan to reach the correct diagnosis.
