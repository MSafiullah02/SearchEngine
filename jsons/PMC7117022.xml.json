Assessments of vaccine safety and anti-CVL efficacy generally require a long follow-up, extending into years of study (Giunchetti et al., 2007, Giunchetti et al., 2008, Roatt et al., 2012).

Although it is well established that macrophages participate in killing parasites through mechanisms that depend on reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates, the mechanisms by which macrophages kill Leishmania in dogs have not been investigated as thoroughly (Rodrigues et al., 2011). The immune response against Leishmania sp. is highly dependent on the microbicidal action of macrophages, which are actually the host cell target of this protozoan; however, macrophages are fully capable of antigen presentation and establishment of an effective response against the parasite (Pinelli et al., 1999).",

However, there is so far no standardized methodology for this purpose, and these tests usually only involve a system with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) without purified T-cell subsets (Pinelli et al., 1999, Holzmuller et al., 2005, Rodrigues et al., 2009). Thus, it is necessary to develop additional methods for evaluating the immune system in veterinary medicine, especially in experimental dog models. Such tests could be included in pre-clinical trials of vaccines against CVL, so that the time needed for the experiments could be reduced. This would likely reduce the costs of experimentation using the dog model and provide a more rational way of selecting candidate vaccines against CVL as well as to evaluate therapeutic protocols. These methods would contribute to the identification of biomarkers related to interactions between the innate and adaptive immune responses of dogs. In this context, our main goal was to analyze the canine immune response using a co-culture system of canine L. chagasi-infected macrophages with different ratios of purified CD4+ and/or CD8+ T-cells. This approach, based on the canine immune response, would be useful in dealing with a number of canine diseases, in addition to evaluating various treatments and vaccines.",

This methodology seems to be useful for analyzing vaccine approaches and treatment against CVL, using peripheral blood samples, instead requiring invasive methods for parasitological/immunological measurements. In general, invasive methods, including bone marrow, spleen and lymph nodes aspirates, despite providing compartmentalized status, relevant to understand the anti-Leishmania host response, usually represent risks, require controlled procedures, qualified professional assistance and may interfere in the host response during follow-up studies. Therefore, the use of well standardized peripheral blood-based methods may allow the assessment of compatible parasitological/immunological parameters and overcome the major restrictions of those invasive procedures and also provide additional information than the already available PBMC-based methods. To establish such assay, in the present investigation we have evaluated the performance of co-culture systems to provide a range of biomarkers, including parasitological approaches to measure the L. chagasi infection status of PBMC-derived macrophages, the NO levels along with the type I and type II cytokines. These analyses were essential for identifying the ideal T-cell:M\u00d8 ratio that yield appropriated parasitological (parasitism frequency and parasite load) and immunological (Nitrite, IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL-12, IL-4 and IL-10) pattern, compatible with the animals analyzed and avoid methodological artifact, that might lead to parasitological/immunological data inconsistent with those expected for a given dog status. Although, the proposed method is an in vitro approach that may not include all elements/events that take place in vivo.

            "text": "In the present study, we have observed that the use of high cell ratios, including the LYM:M\u00d8 system, 1:1:1, and 2:2:1 ratios for CD4+:CD8+:M\u00d8 system and 1:1, 2:1 ratios in the purified CD4+:M\u00d8 or CD8+:M\u00d8 systems, showed an enhanced frequency of macrophage lysis (data not shown). Although the macrophage lysis mediated by T-cells would not be expected at high levels for uninfected dogs used in the present study, it is possible that methodological artifacts generating non-natural over cytokine microenvironment was created in the co-culture systems using disproportional cell ratios that possibly let to un-specific lysis of L. chagasi\u2013infected macrophages. Therefore, it appears that the choice of an ideal cell ratio for co-culture systems using CD4+ T-cells or CD8+ T-cells ratio that not exceed 1:2 seems to be fundamental to a confident in vitro system that resemble the immunological status of the uninfected dogs evaluated in this study. Few studies have included co-culture using canine purified T-cell subsets, as proposed here (Pinelli et al., 1994, Holzmuller et al., 2005, Bourdoiseau et al., 2009). The cytotoxic activity of canine CD8+ T-cells co-cultured with L. infantum\u2013infected macrophages was first reported by Pinelli et al. (1994). In that study, the lymphocytes from asymptomatic dogs infected with L. infantum were able to produce high levels of IFN-\u03b3, whereas cells of symptomatic dogs did not. However, the authors reported that in some animals, CD4+ T-cells were also capable of lysing L. infantum\u2013infected macrophages, but without specifying the ways in which lysis triggered by this subpopulation of lymphocytes could occur (Pinelli et al., 1999, Holzmuller et al., 2005). In the present study, we also observed cell lysis in the co-culture system employing CD4+ T-cells and L. chagasi\u2013infected macrophages, especially at the ratio 1:1 (data not shown). Indeed, these findings suggest that CD4+ may contribute to the cytotoxic function in the canine model.",

            "text": "In the present study, the co-culture system that uses total lymphocytes or simultaneously use CD4+:CD8+ T-cells in both cell ratios (1:1:1 and 2:2:1) led to enhanced production of NO, all leading to levels above the cut-off. The NO levels were similar between the macrophage co-cultured with CD4+ and/or CD8+ T-cells, showing NO production over the cut-off edge of 5 \u03bcM only when high ratio of purified T-cells were used. The NO levels in co-cultures using CD4+ or CD8+ T-cells at 1:5 and 1:2 ratios showed values below the cut-off edge, similar to the parasitological profile observed for the tested uninfected dogs. Our hypothesis is that as when a dog present a efficient anti-Leishmania response, achieve by effective vaccination, asymptomatic infection or successful treatment, a compatible parasite control mediated by enhanced NO production would be detected in the proposed co-culture method. In the context of biomarkers regarding Leishmania control, NO is considered as a crucial mediator for controlling intracellular pathogens, and its analysis was incorporated into this study. However, NO production may vary depending on cell type. For example, murine cell line J774 macrophages produce higher levels of NO than canine macrophages (Pinelli et al., 2000, Gantt et al., 2001, Holzmuller et al., 2002). Furthermore, in a study using a strain of Darby canine macrophages, the authors did not find significant differences between the levels of NO cell line in comparison with PBMC cultures (Panaro et al., 1998). However, the levels of phagocytosis and parasitism control were significantly higher in cultures of PBMC stimulated with concavaline A (Panaro et al., 1998). Various studies have shown the importance of NO in the control of Leishmania infection as an effector molecule, indicating immunogenicity induction (Giunchetti et al., 2007, Ara\u00fajo et al., 2009, Reis et al., 2010) and reduction in the parasitic index in L. infantum-infected macrophages, and thus contributing to the establishment of an immunoprotection profile in vaccinated dogs (Holzmuller et al., 2005, Lemesre et al., 2007).",

We demonstrated that the levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3 and were significantly higher in the all co-culture systems of total lymphocytes and also T-cells with L. chagasi\u2013infected macrophages. These results are similar to those obtained in other studies using cell cultures with whole lymphocytes (Holzmuller et al., 2005, Lemesre et al., 2007). Furthermore, it was reported that L. infantum\u2013infected macrophages co-cultured with whole lymphocytes from dogs immunized with the LiESAp vaccine showed increased levels of IFN-\u03b3 in addition to reduction in the in vitro parasite load (Holzmuller et al., 2005, Lemesre et al., 2007). Vaccination of dogs also induces an increased percentage of T lymphocytes producing IFN-\u03b3, especially CD4+ T-cells (Ara\u00fajo et al., 2009, Ara\u00fajo et al., 2011). Likewise, the levels of IFN-\u03b3 measured in our study were higher (\u223c1000 pg/mL) in co-cultures using purified CD4+ T-cells than in those using CD8+ T-cells (\u223c400 pg/mL). Moreover, co-cultures using PBMC and L. chagasi\u2013infected macrophages from healthy dogs demonstrated a positive correlation between mRNA levels of IFN-\u03b3/IL-4 and parasite load (Rodrigues et al., 2009). For all the co-culture ratios in this study, IL-4 and IL-10 levels were similar to those of the control group. However, there were significant reductions in IL-10 between the 1:1 and 1:2 co-cultures with CD4+ T-cells and the 1:5 and 1:2 co-cultures with CD8+ T-cells. Importantly, with the exception of the first studies (Pinelli et al., 1994, Pinelli et al., 1995, Pinelli et al., 1999) in which the co-cultures were performed with purified T-cells, the other studies in the literature (Holzmuller et al., 2005, Lemesre et al., 2007, Rodrigues et al., 2007, Rodrigues et al., 2009) were performed using whole lymphocytes. However, because the proposed co-culture system may be applied in detailed analysis of the canine immune response, it would be useful and highly relevant to employ purified T-cell subsets in this in vitro system.",

The methodology employing co-culture of L. chagasi\u2013infected macrophages and purified CD4+ or CD8+ T-cell subsets induced a microenvironment compatible with the expected status of the analyzed dogs. In this context, co-culture system with T-cells from uninfected dogs at 1:5 and 1:2 ratio did not control the infection, yielding to patent in vitro parasitism (\u226580%), low NO production (\u22645 \u03bcM) and IL-10 modulated (IFN-\u03b3/IL-10\u22642) immunological profile in vitro. CD4+ or CD8+ T-cells at 1:5 or 1:2 ratios to L. chagasi\u2013infected macrophages seems to be ideal for in vitro assays, as this ratio was able to induce in vitro biomarkers profile related to the expected status of the dogs analyzed.

Co-culture systems were set up with total lymphocytes: M\u00d8 and also distinct CD4+:CD8+ T-cell:M\u00d8 ratios (LYM:M\u00d8 ; 1:1:1  and 2:2:1 ) and compared with the control culture of L. chagasi-infected M\u00d8 alone (). (A) Parasitological biomarkers reflecting the overall parasitism, including the frequency of L. chagasi-infected M\u00d8 (%) and parasite load (# amastigotes/M\u00d8) were evaluated in the co-culture systems (upper panels) and for the ratio of co-culture/control cultures (bottom panels). Immunological biomarkers, including (B) nitric oxide (\u03bcM) and (C) the cytokines TNF-\u03b1, IL-12, IFN-\u03b3, IL-4 and IL-10 (pg/mL) and IFN-\u03b3/IL-10 ratio, were measured in the supernatant from the co-culture systems. The connecting lines indicate in all cases significant differences at p < 0.05. The parasitism (\u226580%), NO production (\u22645 \u03bcM) and IFN-\u03b3/IL-10 balance (\u22642) were used as a cut-off edge (doted lines), acceptable for uninfected dogs, to evaluate the co-culture system performance.
