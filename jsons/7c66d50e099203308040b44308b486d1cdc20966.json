            "text": "Firstly, it suggests the inadequacy of the context-specific frameworks developed for each of the representative disasters in relation to properly engaging the ethical quandaries of PHDs as a class of global problem. Secondly, it suggests the need to develop a broader and more encompassing moral compass for engaging public health disasters as a specific class of global health problems. Developing such a broad moral framework will, however, require an approach beyond extant ethical lenses. In other words, the conceptual building blocks of a global ethical framework will reflect some transnational moral diversity as well as incorporate multi-disciplinary perspectives. Scholars like ten Have favors the latter approach in stating that ethics, as it increasingly becomes global and broader, should be a language of several voices. 1 Global bioethics pursues global problems, that is, issues that will cause significant harm in the absence of cross-border and trans-national cooperation. 2 Without a doubt, public health disasters are a class of global problems as they or their impacts can originate from any region of the world as well as disseminate to other parts of the globe. They, therefore, often rapidly transform local issues into global ones. As such, the attendant ethical quandaries demand a global bioethical solution. Against this conceptual foreground, this chapter seeks to articulate the relational bases of the ethical issues elicited by public health disasters, examine the limits of the four different moral approaches to specific public health disasters that were developed in Chaps. 2 through 5, as well as use some of the associated relational insights to frame a global ethical framework that may help engage the moral issues embedded in PHDs as a category of global health problems.",

Central to them is what a single individual or a group of individuals within or outside the location of a disaster may do or fail to do in response to the challenges and needs of other human beings during a public health disaster. On the other hand, the second category of quandaries arises due to the interaction or non-interaction of human, biological, and non-human dynamics. Issues in this cat-egory include biological and epistemic uncertainties, biological and geographic vulnerabilities, and whether there is a non-human \"being\" or \"God\" who responds to the moral inadequacies of humankind.

These can, however, be analyzed through a relational lens involving two human agents, or groups of these. Individual members of a society afflicted with a given PHD may be physicians, nurses, civil servants, hunters, morticians, policymakers, or university professors. For public health disasters with biological agents such as a bacteria (e.g. Mycobacterium tuberculosis) or a virus (e.g. influenza A virus), the way any of these moral entities encounter the agent and the subsequent way they relate with other members of the society (such as friends, children, colleagues, patients, clients, and strangers) will influence whether a disaster ensues. In the context of Ebola viral disease, an innocent surgery on an undiagnosed patient will start a concentric ring of infection cycle from the health workers to the community. 3 This often contributes to the cycle of diseases, deaths, and displacement. The \"susceptibility factor\" or vulnerability nexus in this context lies in human-human relationships that may be economic, health-related, professional, filial or social.",

In the African context, this is particularly significant because most health and social institutions were established without genuine local interests in mind and with goals alien to the local logic and interests. 4 As such, policies tainted by this background or other kinds of policies, poor or good, or badly implemented ones, will shape social realities by influencing the actions and inactions of different sets of people. O'Hare recently observed that the minimal expenditure on health historically contributed to the crippling of the Sierra Leonean healthcare system. He noted that the country (where 53% of the population live below the poverty line) spends $25 million on health and $244 million to give tax incentives to foreign companies and organizations. 5 In other words, a more rational and need-based spending would have enhanced the capacity of health institutions to mount a better response to the Ebola incident.

In this vein, Kentikelenis et al. argue that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) contributed to the circumstances that enabled the crisis to arise and/or worsen in the west African region through their prior policies that had partly weakened the health systems in countries like Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, 7 Specifically, the conditionalities of the IMF which mandated recipient governments to adopt policies that prioritize short-term economic objectives over investment in healthcare and education 8 may be fingered because Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone have received IMF support since 1990. 9 This clearly suggests that the vulnerability of people to health disasters such as Ebola in these regions and the attendant trans-border health risks posed to nearby nations and the global village may begin prior to any specific incident.",

For instance, the Structural Adjustment Program in most African countries was instrumental to rising ill-health and decreasing access to healthcare in the two-thirds of the population. 12 These are important underlying factors that need to be engaged, understood, and prevented from reoccurring. Some policy deficits which may facilitate PHDs, are however, found in several nations, hence, are global in nature. Whereas cases of atypical drug-resistant TB have been identified in fifty different countries, 13 diagnostic capacities are generally poor across the globe. Lack of policy in this direction is worrisome because drug-resistant TB is one of the most profound challenges facing global health. 14 The global dynamics of public health disasters also echo through the movement of people as was exemplified by the case of Patrick Sawyer (Liberia-Nigeria nexus), Pauline Cafferkey (Sierra Leone-UK nexus), and Thomas Duncan (Liberia-USA nexus). These cases underscored how an infectious disease outbreak in just a place poses a significant risk everywhere 15 and the capacity of trans-national infectious diseases to get out of control if not handled properly. This notion was exemplified in China's slow reaction to the 2003 SARS outbreak and how the country restricted international access to patients and information which is believed to have contributed to the global intensity of that crisis. 16 In other words, how a local public health disaster is handled determines and influences local severity, and how it spreads elsewhere. On the other hand, well-handled local health crises positively shape the possible impacts on contiguous nations as was demonstrated by Canada's rapid and coordinated response to the SARS outbreak which limited its spread and impact in the United States. 17 losis, and Ebola infections, and is often borne out of the absence of state-financed subsidizing of health for the indigent. People who have never cared for the rights of others can hardly be counted upon to respect the rights of victims of disasters. Indeed, victims of disasters who have been brought up in contexts bereft of an understanding of rights will hardly know when their rights are violated by public health measures such as forced quarantine. In addition, those who associate some rights violation with quarantine measures and whose input has not been sought prior to the implementation of such measures will likely resist or not comply. This played out significantly during the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. 18 Such contextual social resistance may inadvertently bring about positive outcomes. For instance, protests at the location of Ebola quarantine center in a crowded hospital in Abuja, Nigeria compelled the government to relocate it to a safer place, thus, potentially preventing infection transmission. However, they may also bring about negative outcomes. For example, public outcry and social resistance led to the suspension of an Ebola trial in 2015. 19 In addition, lack of knowledge about the limits of influenza therapeutic measures and their possible side-effects as well as the failure of health authorities to disclose these bits of information will make people at risk accept the associated potential harms without asking the right questions and making duly informed decisions. To be sure, by trying to prevent personal harms through wearing protective suits during Ebola outbreaks, some patients may feel alienated and refrain from giving full information necessary for clinical diagnosis 20 Also, prior experience with the ethically challenging practice of triage and rationing during disasters will influence how compliance will be achieved. Lastly, the previously stated issues in conjunction with existing local and transnational policies will influence matters of justice.",

Integral to these is the increasing relegation of religious and metaphysical concerns vis-\u00e0-vis the explanation of real-world events. At the individual level, the Western intellectual tradition generally conceives the human person as a moral agent who is ultimately accountable to himself. This logic locates the destiny of the individual person and consequently that of the whole universe in the conceptual conclave of human agency. Thus, it celebrates the individualistic mantra of me, myself and I, 21 while advocating free social contact and contract between people as the basis for situating social laws and accountability. This view has its core biological foundations in Darwinism, has generally fostered atheistic and agnostic attitudes, and has adopted science as its religious priest. 22 It has likewise given rise to secular strands of morality with their own sets of \"ises\" or descriptive ethical lens and oughts or normative ethical prisms.

That is, only PHDs whose origins are completely natural are amenable to human manipulation through relevant social measures. It also suggests the possibility that responses to the quandaries and challenges associated with such natural disasters may not be adequately engaged through human-based ethical reasoning and responses alone. Thirdly, it implies that ignorance of the \"divine will\" or disobedience to it will exert tangible effects on personal and social life in the form of divine retribution.

One-time events and metaphysical realities are outside the purview of scientific investigations because they are non-replicable. Secondly, there are several transcultural accounts of how the supernatural has causally influenced human behavior and experiences, as well as the course of natural events. For instance, there are verifiable miracles that have occurred within the Christian tradition that defy scientific explanations. 25 Divine interventions have also been recorded in several traditional religions across the globe. 26 Similarly, religious relics have been used in Sicily to thwart earthquakes. 27 Hence, an open approach or what scholars like Dupre calls a combination of insights from a variety of perspectives not limited to the scientific arena 28 may hold the key to an adequate account of human nature and behavior. Such a combinational approach seems apt for addressing PHDs such as earthquakes that may have some metaphysical undertones. Beyond offering a descriptive account, such an approach should also provide some normative template that bears a relationship to the scientific as well as the religious. Without a doubt, public health disasters foster suffering. But they also create the atmosphere for sober reflection which may facilitate personal ratiocination vis-\u00e0-vis the individual relationship (if any) to the divine. Therefore, they may serve as a critical avenue for seeking answers to the existential and teleological purposes of life or the affirmation of agnostic and atheistic stance.",

Since culture and society often exist in a fluid state, 31 it is no surprise that the forces of Westernization have so much altered the African local culture that to find a \"purely\" African man in this day and age may be likened to finding a needle in a haystack. This is partly due to the traditional axis of socialization that has been supplanted or conjoined with other agents of socialization such as radio, television, and Western education; the concerns of which communicate little (if at all) of the indigenous African values and moral vision of life. It is also because of the deliberate forces of neoliberal capitalism as well as the neocolonial interference of some foreign powers in the local affairs of African nations. This has been ascribed to the reluctant way through which political independence was granted to most African states and the formulation of former colonial powers of social and economic policies that contribute to poverty and underdevelopment in the African continent. 32 The African local context is, therefore, neither genuinely African nor completely Westernized and does not reflect a systematic integration or synthesis of the two. It is a context of dislocation where the local sense of self constantly suffers erosion by the alien other aided by local and foreign actors. 33 According to Verhren, one of the primary goals of ethics is the nature of life (description) and how it is to be lived (normativity). 34 Hence, without a true description of the contemporary nature of the African cultural reality and the attendant moral ethos, it may be difficult to frame an ethical prism that reflects the cognitive frame of mind of the people. Without this, it will also be difficult to assess the impact and point of asymmetries with Western ethical prisms. This underscores the local and national limits of the Ubuntu moral framework in African societies as well as the need to forge a relational nexus amongst the people to unpack a social ethic which will help reveal real from perceived values.",

This will clearly weaken the effectiveness of communication during PHDs and may engender unfounded forms of mistrust while hindering cooperation, especially amongst members of the public. This may partly explain why a lot of people resisted quarantine, and many more went into hiding to foil contact tracing attempts in the last Ebola outbreak. This connotes the notion that logic hardly completely holds sway during public health disasters. Illogical behavior during health emergencies is, however, not new. For example, during a cholera outbreak on board a ship in New York in 1849, 150 passengers escaped from the quarantine facility. 37 Practically, this creates some degree of uncertainty about possible expected patterns of attitude and behavior to a PHD. For instance, during the Ebola outbreak in Nigeria, a consultant physician agreed to treat one of the contacts of the index case (Patrick Sawyer) in a hotel for financial gain. The diplomat had escaped being quarantined in Lagos and fled to Port Harcourt, 300 miles southeast of Lagos. That singular action caused him his life, infected his wife, other relatives, and patients he had attended to in his private clinic. Ultimately, it put more than 200 people at risk. 38 The consultant's decision and action are clearly anti-Ubuntuan. However, if someone with advanced medical training could jettison personal safety, sacrifice family health, and community well-being for pecuniary reasons, one can only wonder how a lay member of the society may act when confronted with a similar scenario wherea choice that does not favor self is required during a public health disaster.",

The care ethical lens seeks to transcend the depersonalized realm of asking \"what obligations do I have to Mr. X\" to the humane realm of asking \"how can I help Mr. X\" in scenarios of moral crises. 44 This assumes some type of Kantian disposition and/or obsession in which moral agents always reflect prior to engaging in specific courses of action. This hardly ever happens in normal life because there is no place where only the moral rules reign supreme. 45 Therefore, it is doubtful if it can consistently be expected to occur in a chaotic disaster situation. If this is true, then how person A will seek to help person B during a public health disaster will be influenced by how they have previously and habitually shown care to friends, neighbors, and strangers as well as the extent of self-effacing that contextual situations demand from them during a disaster context.

Public health disasters come with the traditional barrage of disasters upon which are superimposed novel health-related challenges. They, therefore, warrant more urgent kinds of local and global responses. Benatar and other colleagues argue that bioethics, with an expanded scope and shared foundational values, can help improve global health through such means as facilitating the emergence of a global state of mind, long-term self-interest, and strengthening capacity. 60 A different ethical approach-a global bioethics-distinct from the mainstream bioethical lens is believed to hold the key to this agenda.",

She regards it as an attempt to universalize a specific brand of normative principles and values, making them globally acceptable and applicable. 62 For Drydyk, global ethics encompasses seeking a reasonable and responsible agreement on global problems based on diverse moral grounds. 63 Global bioethics is often linked with globalization and does involve the currents of globalization. However, scholars like ten Have recently argued that it is not birthed solely by globalization but involves seeking broader solutions to the ethical issues elicited by health, disease, life, and death. 64 Methodologically, scholars like Chiarelli believe that a global bioethical approach needs to involve humanistic as well as theological insights and perspectives. 65 Sinaci notes that serious bioethical reflection cannot engage real issues without the religious dimension, thus, highlighting the need for a clear understanding of religious models and traditions, and their essential concepts: birth, life, health, sickness, suffering, and death. 66 For ten Have, global bioethics should be inter-disciplinary and incorporate some scientific methodology. 67 More recently, he has argued that it entails a broader view of the biological, social, political, and environmental dynamics of healthcare, biomedical sciences, and research. 68 Others have noted that global bioethics also seeks to foster an agreement between mankind and nature. 69 This is necessary because the health of humankind closely ties with and is shaped by the environment within which they live in a web-like ecosystem of competition (with other life forms) with varying degrees of dependency. 70 For van Potter, secular morality and religious cooperation can drive global bioethics despite the modern mire of pluralism. 71 In other words, a global bioethics can help tease out a sane and relevant voice amidst the cacophony of ideological voices that are present in today's' intellectual discourse.",

Since there is often a dynamic relationship between nature and nurture, 75 one can argue that a global ethic (and by extension global bioethics) should flexibly reflect the changing dimensions of the local and global nature of human experiences and ethical lenses in relation to the complex and multifaceted influences that may stem from some of the problems of nurture. Rosemarie Tong recently echoed this idea in describing global bioethics as a form of bioethical approach that takes into consideration the diversity of peoples and cultures in seeking ways to improve people's health across the globe. 76 The idea of a global bioethics is, however, a very hotly contested issue. According to Hutchings, this arises in the context of realizing a global ethic whose aim is to control moral global policies, laws, and institutions, directly or indirectly. 77 Objections are leveled against such an interpretation in terms of charges of neocolonialism, moral imperialism. intellectual hegemony, as well as cultural domination. 78 At the heart of these conceptual contentions, however, is the nature and variations of moral reasoning and how to arrive at a consensus on this. To be sure, moral reflections and their outcomes or ethical perspectives reflect differing diversities because different moral building blocks constitute their foundations.",

In contemporary global health, no country can successfully insulate itself from major health hazards. 85 By implication, they require trans-national cooperation and solutions.

Specifically, it has contributed to the reality that 90% of worldwide medical research expenditure targets problems affecting only 10% of the world's population. 122 It has also affected the drugpurchasing power of people living in developing economies where up to 90% of drug costs may be borne by individuals. 123 Public health encompasses societal collective response to prolong life via creating healthy conditions, or factors that create healthy conditions, 124 thus, global health problems cannot be fixed unless the underlying forces that have shaped its emergence are examined. One unsettling example is the role of neoliberal forces that generally conceives human beings as instrumental means to economic ends. 125 Sonia Shah projected that by 2016, 1% of the world population will be in control of more than half of the world's total wealth. 126 However, health is incompatible with market forces. 127 In relation to the problem of local and global justice, the relationalbased global ethic can help mobilize and unite relevant moral agents and stakeholders with a view to identifying corporations and organizations that perpetuate this trend, sanctioning them (when applicable) and reversing extant laws (for instance, IMF agreements) that have created the situation ab initio.",

Individual nation states have particular legal obligations to offer security and health to her citizens based on available capacity and capabilities. 130 Since PHDs like pandemic influenza are not just about microbes and science, 131 dismissing local contexts and nuances is not a path fraught with wisdom. The relational-based global ethic offers a means of responding to local nuances and differences in several ways. In the African context, for instance, the notion of responding to vulnerabilities through relevant acts of solidarity can help mobilize relevant stakeholders and other moral actors to engage the underlying social, ideological, and political factors that shortchange responses to health related-issues, especially PHDs. This can help evolve what Farmer describes as models capable of incorporating change and complexity, and which reflect local variations. 132 Public health in the African context encompasses some elements of unknown or uncharted territory that has scanty or no interaction with the public social system. Its needs are equally ever hardly anchored into public health policy and plans. On this note, it was observed (in Chap. 2) that public health within the African context incorporates the traditional sense of the science and art of promoting health and preventing disease 133 as well as the state of health of those disconnected from the social system with the attendant need to critically understand this and develop relevant interventions. The relational-based global ethic developed in this book may help engage the uncharted \"public\" within the health system via its responsiveness to local realities. This underscores the need for societies to serve her citizens prior to expecting the same people to be selfless patrons in a time of public health emergencies.",

In the specific context of PHDs, identifying relevant moral actors and assigning responsibilities can help eliminate or reduce the chaos of disaster. This can also help halt the external influx of aid and NGO workers, which will help avoid unnecessary physical and material presence. 134 Public health disasters require a great deal of other-centricity with a willingness to embrace additional and supererogatory responsibilities. In contemporary society, however, everyone seems to be sheltered within their own little bubbles, only finding just enough time to prepare a face to meet the faces that others will see, as Thomas Eliot once describes such a social attitude. 135 Technology has probably worsened this trend. 136 Yet, the inevitable demands of responding to PHDs also require that society reinvents itself, at least in its other-centric dispositions. The extent of this will probably vary across countries and continents, with traditional communalistic societies such as Asian and African contexts probably finding it easier compared to traditionally individualistic Euro-American societies.",

In this regard, it specifically echoes the idea that ethics and public health issues can hardly be successfully advanced and pursued without considering the values of the general society as well as that of the specific communities where public ethical course of action is to be carried out. 142 Karl Popper describes the world as emergent and in need of explanatory approximations of its state of affairs that are non-static. 143 If this is true, and if people across cultures and geographies are now inevitably caught up in an intricate web of mutuality; 144 a flexible global nexus is needed. This is partly because of the increasing rate at which the world is \"shrinking\" via the currents of globalization 145 and the ease with which infectious disease dynamics of PHDs (e.g. through Ebola and pandemic influenza) and the emotional components (e.g. through earthquakes) may readily traverse national and international borders. To be sure, there are multiple means through which infection enters and exits the human body as well as the means of infection transmission from one individual to the next, 146 and from one community to the next, and globally. In short, global problems including those with infectious dynamics now spread with ease across national borders. 147 Hutchings notes that a global ethic should help disintegrate and destabilize hierarchies of power, identity and wealth. 148 Such a global ethic will seek to prevent harm and encourage courses of actions which are amenable to this end, explore the cooperation of nations and multi-national organizations relevant to socio-political and economic contexts to promote wellness and eliminate avoidable diseases. 149 The relational-based ethic developed in this chapter offers several channels through which an agenda like this may be realized. In addition, evolving a global warning system is one way through which a practical approach 150 may be brought to PHDs such as ADR-TB. This is partly supported by the idea that constant vigilance is essential to freedom from infectious diseases. 151 Hardly would anyone deny the idea that poorer nations are unable to meet the economic demands that are necessary to engage PHDs at the institutional and social levels. These include procuring vaccines and bearing the financial burdens of temporary pandemic-associated losses due to the closure of businesses as well as any form of compensation (from the government) that may positively influence compliance to public health directives. In this vein, richer nations should be obligated to show differing degrees of pecuniary solidarity. This form of solidarity, however, differs from an act of charity because it is a preventive action that will decrease the possibility of a trans-national and global dissemination of infection cycles.",

This is important because values derive partly from a normative understanding of human nature and from a transcendental or secular perspective on life and the world. 153 Whereas scholars like Annas argue that useful disaster-related policies and practices should override individual interests, 154 a global ethic that is sensitive to the metaphysical frame of reference that victims and survivors may autonomously choose to adopt does not support such an idea. Rather, it respects the individuality, dignity, and intrinsic capacity of such people to make choices that cause no harm to others. Obviously, religious claims to causality are difficult to reproduce under controlled experimental conditions. However, the fact that science does not offer answers to deep existential questions that have confronted humanity since antiquity underscores the need to respect the choices of those individuals that adopt metaphysical ideas to explain and cope with natural disasters such as earthquakes. To be sure, if global bioethics needs to take into account the sphere of the spiritual and unseen in pursuing moral analysis, 155 ignoring this dimension limits the depth of its praxis.",

In other words, human considerations should always trump scientific ones. The relational-based global lens does not offer justification for clinical research on victims of other PHDs such as earthquakes. This is partly because research in such a scenario is largely a form of scientific luxury, 156 and partly because asking people already burdened with severe emotional, physical, and other kinds of traumatic stress to enroll in research reflects asking too much from fragile people as well as a possible violation of their dignity.",

This may be followed by formulating context-suitable solutions to each of the representative problems with sensitivity to trans-national nuances and limitations. Finally, it argued that examining the common threats posed by the problems, unearthing common cores and forging a flexible framework using the conceptual and ethical insights that intersect around the context-specific solutions may give a broader or global normative lens for resolving a class of global problems.",

Because personal morality often differs from public morality, and because other-centricity is hardly a norm in contemporary society, it is important to seek creative ways to create some level of other-centricity in the populace prior to the occurence of a PHD. Social and formal education and a right psychological mindset 158 are essential to realizing this goal. Finally, this chapter offered four levels of justification for the proposed global ethic. In this vein, it argued that the proposed ethic is justified for engaging public health disasters as a class of global problems because it is responsive and sensitive to local realities, global realities, microbial as well as spiritual realities and scientific concerns. By reflecting these four values, the GEF is sufficiently nuanced to engage different Western and non-Western contexts. This is important because nuances permit challenging and unusual scenarios to be flexibly engaged using the same frame of reference. 159 ",
