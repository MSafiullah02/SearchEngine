Screening tools, such as the Vulnerable Elders Surgical Pathways and Outcomes Assessment (VES-PA) and the comprehensive Optimal Perioperative Management of the Geriatric Patient recommended by the American College of Surgeons (ACS), have been proposed with variable clinical implementation [1]. The complexity of these tools which include multiple components to each assessment system limits their clinical applicability and ability to translate into daily practice [2, 5]. Age has been independently associated with operative morbidity and mortality in elderly patients [3, 6]. Frailty has also been associated with perioperative fitness, outcomes, and likely discharge destination [4, 5, 8]. However, many accepted measurements of frailty are also complex [9]. Other proposed variables associated with outcomes in the elderly include do-not-resuscitate status, sarcopenia, and preoperative hemoglobin [4, 5].",

Though frailty as a global concept has emerged as a useful predictor of perioperative complications, the most appropriate variables for geriatric-specific risk stratification remain unclear [2, 4, 8]. In 2014, the ACS NSQIP Geriatric Surgery Pilot program began collecting geriatric-specific risk factors, such as cognition, decision making, function, and mobility. Collecting and analyzing data within these new categories allows for targeted investigation of unique risks and outcomes among elderly patients [11]. In this study, we aim to examine the association between patient-specific geriatric variables on short-term postoperative outcomes including mortality, morbidity, readmission, and the impact on discharge destination among patients selected for elective major abdominal operations.",

Differences in distribution of categorical variables were compared using Chi square or Fisher\u2019s exact test, as appropriate. Four separate multivariable models were developed to test the associations between a priori determined relevant covariates and primary and secondary outcome measures. Covariates included in multivariable models were age group, hepatopancreatic versus colorectal operation, and logit of the ACS NSQIP-estimated probability of mortality (for mortality model) or logit of the ACS NSQIP-estimated probability of morbidity (for morbidity, readmission, and discharge destination models). Patients who died were excluded from the readmission and discharge destination multivariable models. All four geriatric-specific GSFR variables were included in each of the multivariable models.

Hospital discharge to a skilled nursing facility has been associated with poor prognosis and significantly decreased survival among patient populations who had intraabdominal operations [18], cardiovascular operations [19], or required intensive care unit admission [20]. In a study of an 89,405 patient cohort who had four types of intraabdominal operations (cholecystectomy, colectomy, hysterectomy/oophorectomy, or prostatectomy), 1-year mortality among patients discharged to an institutional care facility was 22.2% compared to 5.9% for patients discharged home [18]. A subsequent analysis of 308,016 surgical patients from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reported a 26.4% 1-year mortality among patients admitted for acute care surgical admission and discharged to a skilled nursing facility [21]. While quantitative studies examining the effect of discharge to a facility and long-term quality of life among surgical patients are lacking, the qualitative effects and patient impact have been well described [22].",
