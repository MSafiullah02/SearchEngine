At the time, this was intended to generate single-stranded RNA (Hornung et al., 2006) , and we therefore interpreted these results as demonstrating that the m7 G cap exerts a strong block on RIG-I activation. In later studies we observed that the in vitro transcription process produces aberrant double stranded ppp-RNA containing side products, and that these are in fact the RNA species responsible for RIG-I activation (Schlee et al., 2009 ). These side products are generated by a RNA template-dependent transcription of complementary RNA (copy-back) by the phage polymerase. Because this copy-back side reaction is not efficient, the concentration of active ligand in transcription mixes are very low, and, thus, m7 G capping has a strong impact on RIG-I activation (In Figure 1C m7 GpppG cap modified dsRNA is completely inactive at 0.5 nM ligand concentration, whereas pppG dsRNA induces approximately 7.5 ng/ml IFN-\u03b1. However, at 5nM m7 GpppGA displays 75% of the activity of pppGA, and m7 GpppG m A has no activity whatsoever.)",

However, the authors did not comment on the time frame and did not check RIG-I expression in HeLa cells. Our data suggest that primary cells are much more sensitive than tumor cells, which might have lost RIG-I function or downstream effector pathways upon tissue culture adaptation. On the other hand, extending usual in vitro experiment time frames could lead to further accumulation of RIG-I stimulating RNA causing a type I IFN background which would be hazardous to a whole organism but tolerable for in vitro cultured cells.",

The resulting fragment was cut with XbaI and KpnI and fused together with the BamHI-XbaI restricted renilla luciferase gene into pBluescript II SK(-) (Stratagene) cut with BamHI and KpnI. A SacII-MluI fragment was released again from the resulting plasmid and cloned together with a NotI-SacII fragment from pBK41 (encompassing the YFV 5'NTR as well as the first 20 codons of the YFV capsid protein fused to an ubiquitin gene downstream of an SP6 promotor) into pACYC177/17D (Bredenbeek et al., 2003) (kindly provided by C.M. Rice, Rockefeller University, NY, NY) cut with MluI and NotI. The resulting yellow fever virus replicon expressing renilla luciferase was abbreviated with YFVR. Prior to mutagenesis of YFV methyltransferase, the YFV-replicon was shortened by excision of a 5,5kb fragment restriction via NotI and SpeI, blunt ends were created by T4 DNA Polymerase (Fermentas)",
