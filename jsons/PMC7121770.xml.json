As it was the global norm, largely due to the experience of the First and Second World Wars, the build-up of balanced conventional capabilities consisting of the army, navy and air force was something common to most militaries in the region, particularly in China, Japan, USA and most of the ASEAN countries. Yet, due to the specific nature and peculiarities of threats in some countries, the conventional capabilities of some militaries were lopsided and structurally unbalanced. While the USA and Japan developed a balanced force structure, this was not true of China and most of the ASEAN member-states. While Japan\u2019s Self-Defence Force largely cloned its structure from that of the USA, the occupying power after Japan\u2019s defeat in the Second World War, China\u2019s military capability was mostly army-based with a weak air force and navy. This was mainly due to the concept of \u2018people\u2019s war\u2019 developed in response to the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s struggle for power in China against the nationalist forces led by Chiang Kai-shek who was eventually defeated and driven to the off-shore island of Taiwan.",

Somewhat more akin to China, most of the ASEAN member-states were afflicted with internal security challenges of one kind or another. The Philippines, Malaya (later Malaysia) and Thailand were threatened by Soviet and Chinese-backed communist insurgencies. To overcome these threats, a largely army-based counter-insurgency mode of military structure was created, with a relatively weak air force and navy. Similarly, due to various separatist threats from within, Indonesia\u2019s military structure was largely army-based with a weak navy and air force. It was also a legacy of Indonesia\u2019s war of nationalism based on guerrilla warfare against the Dutch from 1945 to 1949 . In contrast, following its separation from Malaysia in 1965, Singapore developed national conscription as the basis of its national defence and endeavoured to create a balanced force structure. This was mainly because of the urban character of Singapore and where there was no jungle-based insurgency threat.",

The most powerful military capability was that of Vietnam with a relatively weaker force structure in Cambodia and Laos. Vietnam\u2019s forte was guerrilla warfare, mainly army-based to win the war of attrition against the USA and its Cold War allies. Brunei developed a weak military capacity with the force structure dominated by the army. It is also assisted by a strong army-based Gurkha force. Like most of Southeast Asia, Myanmar (formerly Burma) developed a force structure that was loaded in favour of the army. This was mainly to deal with the armed struggle launched by the regional ethnic separatist forces since 1947, something that still characterises Myanmar today. It air force and navy are relatively weak. All in all, serious budget constraints also led to lesser investments being made for the air force and navy.",

While the specific definition of what constitutes non-traditional security threats remain contested, generally it refers to challenges to a state\u2019s well-being and survival from non-military sources (Caballero-Anthony 2007). According to one definition, this includes challenges stemming from \u2018climate change, resource scarcity, infectious diseases, natural disasters, irregular migration, food shortages, people smuggling, drug trafficking and transnational crime\u2019 (What are NTS Issues? 2016). These threats have become increasingly important in the post-Cold War era in the context of rising globalisation, environmental degradation and international terrorism. Advances in technology and communications have also facilitated this process. In turn, this has opened up new vistas and facets of security, and its conceptualisation. Equally important, not only are these threats transnational in character but they also require comprehensive solutions involving political, economic, socio-cultural and even psychological dimensions (Caballero-Anthony 2010). Military force alone cannot resolve these threats, in turn, leading to the role expansion of the military with the rise of what has been referred to as the \u2018humanitarian\u2019 use of military power, be it in peacekeeping operations, and humanitarian and disaster relief. The rise in importance of military operations other than war (MOOTW) , which aims to deter war, resolve conflict, promote peace and support civilian authorities in response to domestic or post-crisis era, is part and parcel, of the changing role of the military and its deployment, both domestically and internationally (Bonn and Baker 2000).",

Many new threats are largely non-military in nature and where the use of military power can be counterproductive. These threats are also transnational in character. As was argued by V. R. Raghavan, \u2018the existing state-centred approach to national security, confined to the defence of a country against territorial aggression, has been widened to the idea of security inclusive of a larger set of threats to the people of the state\u2019 (Iqbal 2016). Hence, the widening of the concept of security and the broadening of what should constitute security studies. Many elements characterise non-traditional security threats. These can arise suddenly from the government or non-government sectors. This makes the threats unpredictable and hence, difficult to address quickly. The transnational character of these threats also make it difficult to neutralise them quickly as was evident from the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997\u201398 , the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak (2003\u201304), the H5NI \u2018bird flu\u2019 virus outbreak in 2007, the Global Financial Crisis in 2008, the outbreak of Ebola in West Africa (2014), the threat by the Islamic State and its global affiliates since 2014, the Zika virus outbreak (2016) , and the recent refugee issue confronting Western Europe (2016).",

There are many reasons for the rise of this non-traditional security threat, with many issues of the post-colonial order continuing to bedevil many communities in Asia and Africa as well as serious issues of governance at home and internationally . The lure of Islamist extremism has been further strengthened by the ideological and doctrinal appeal of a supranational radical narrative that is able to link local grievances with global movements, and state and non-state actors that are blamed for the state of affairs in the Muslim majority and minority states. As radical elements coalesce around radical supranational movements and actors such as Al Qaeda and the self-proclaimed Islamic State to target states through wanton acts of violence, law and order forces, especially the police, military and even intelligence agencies are being reinvigorated to respond both within and without the state borders through various cooperative schemes.",

What is termed the Islamic State today would probably not be in existence had the USA not invaded Iraq in 2003. The West and in particular the USA was complicit in the creation and rise of the Islamic State on two grounds. First, by invading Iraq to oust Saddam Hussein and his regime, it created the conditions for the rise of a Sunni-based terrorist group that was both anti-West, especially American and anti-Shia. Second, later, as part of a strategy to undermine and oust Bashir Assad of Syria, the USA , together with its close allies, both Arabs and in the West, funded a then largely weak ISIS, boomeranging into what ISIS has become today, a Frankenstein Monster, in turn, leading to the flow of more than 35,000 foreign fighters from nearly 100 countries, including from Southeast Asia, to join ISIS in Iraq and Syria. The brutalities and atrocities that the Islamic States have perpetrated are unparalleled in recent history, aimed at provoking counter-actions that will only benefit the ISIS to the detriment of the USA, the West and conservative-feudal Arab states.",

This provided the Al Qaeda with an opportunity to intervene in Iraq. In early 2004, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a Jordanian, established the Organisation of Monotheism and Jihad (OMJ) that was affiliated with Al Qaeda. Later, the OMJ morphed into the Organization of Jihad\u2019s Base in the Country of Two Rivers, commonly referred to as the Al Qaeda Iraq (AQI). In January 2006, the AQI \u2018iraqized\u2019 itself by renaming itself as Mujahidin Shura Council (MSC), also partly to distant itself from Al Qaeda.

The ISI\u2019s leadership was taken over by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi aka Abu Duwa. With the outbreak of a civil war in Syria, ISI took advantage of the Sunni-Shia civil war by fighting against Shia and Assad forces in Syria. On 9 April 2013, Abu Bakr declared the establishment of the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Shaam. On 29 June 2014, the establishment of a new Caliphate with Abu Bakr as the Caliph was announced. ISIS also renamed itself as the Islamic State or Daulah Islamiyyah. Thus, even though ISIS originated from Al Qaeda, over time, it distanced itself from the premier terrorist organisation, especially its leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, viewing Al Qaeda and its leadership as being irrelevant, ineffective and inferior in the context of the ongoing jihadi struggle in the Islamic World, especially in the Middle East.",

ISIS was the blowback and backlash to this new political-security order created by the Americans and their clients in Iraq. This led to the exponential growth of a Sunni-driven insurgency that eventually evolved into ISIS.

This is because the backward-looking and archaic-oriented Salafiyyah and Wahhabiyyah orthodoxy of Saudi Arabia, which colours the conservative Saudi regime, was highly responsible in supporting Sunni groups that were anti-Shia, anti-Iran and anti-Assad. This led to Saudi Arabia and a number of conservative pro-American regimes in the Gulf States such as Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait to bankroll extremist and radical groups that eventually coalesced to form the Islamic States. According to The Washington Post, Kuwait, a designated Non-NATO Ally of the USA, \u2018is the leading source of funding for al-Qaeda linked terrorists [ Jabhat al-Nusra] fighting in Syria\u2019s civil war\u2019 (Glaser 2014). In fact, the US Treasury Undersecretary, David Cohen, referred to Kuwait as the \u2018epicentre of fundraising for terrorist groups in Syria\u2019 (Glaser 2014). Similarly Qatar is believed to be funding extremist group such as Al Qaeda and its affiliate, Jabhat al-Nusra, and the Islamic State. Interestingly, Jabhat al-Nusra is on the US blacklist of terrorist organisations and yet, the US Government is channelling weapons and money to it to hurt both Assad and the Islamic State. It was in this context that the Syrian Foreign Minister, Walid al-Moallem called on the West, not just to undertake military strikes against the Islamic State but also to cut off its sources of funding for these groups. Otherwise, \u2018it will create a whirlpool of which the international community will not exit in decades\u2019 (Alakbar English 2014).",

According to John Brennan, the CIA Director (cited in Blanchard and Humud 2016, p. 7):To compensate for territorial losses , ISIL will probably rely more on guerrilla tactics, including high profile attacks outside the territory in Syria and Iraq that it currently holds\u2026. Unfortunately, despite all of our progress against ISIL on the battlefield and in the financial realm, our efforts have not reduced the group\u2019s terrorism capability and global reach. The resources needed for terrorism are very modest, and the group would have to suffer even heavier losses on territory, manpower and money for its terrorist capacity to decline significantly. Moreover, the group\u2019s foreign branches and global networks can help preserve its capacity for terrorism, regardless of events in Iraq and Syria. In fact, as the pressure mounts on ISIL, we judge that it will intensify its global terror campaign to maintain its dominance of the global terrorism agenda\u2026. We judge that ISIL is training and attempting to deploy operatives for further attacks. ISIL has large cadre of Western fighters who could potentially serve as operatives for attacks in the West. And the group is probably exploring a variety of means for infiltrating operatives into the West, including in refugee flows, smuggling routes and legitimate methods of travel. Furthermore, as we have seen in Orlando, San Bernardino and elsewhere, ISIL is attempting to inspire attacks by sympathisers who have no direct links to the group.\n",

This is also due to the transnational character of terrorism, driven mainly from outside the territory of the targeted state, such as the Mumbai (India) attacks in November 2008, with the perpetrators coming from Pakistan. Hence, there are many cases where the militaries in the Asia-Pacific are prepared to tackle non-traditional security threats because their conventional military capabilities have already been technologically engineered for dual use or even more important, there has been a historical legacy where the military, rather than simply focusing on external threats, has also been involved in counter-terrorism operations. In Southeast Asia, for instance, there is a long history of the militaries in Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines and Thailand being involved in counter-terrorism operations, be it against groups driven by secular ideologies such as the various communist movements or religiously oriented groups such as the Al Qaeda and the Islamic State.

Military operations can also disrupt terrorist operations. On the flip side, military operations can prove counterproductive.

The military has also been used to deter terrorist attacks through its deployment in public places or to guard critical infrastructure. The military has also been used to interdict, both on air and the high seas, of terrorists or arms shipment. Many militaries are also involved in training friendly foreign forces in counter-terrorism operations. The military, especially its specialised units, has undertaken hostage rescue. Militaries are also involved in clandestine operation and intelligence gathering. More poignantly, militaries have been involved with various degrees of operations in pre-emptive intervention, targeted killing, retaliation and , in the final analysis, in undertaking regime change (Hughes 2011, pp. 40\u201359).",

There are many sound reasons for choosing the Indonesian case study to illuminate the nexus between the military and counter-terrorism. Unlike many armed forces, the Indonesian military has been involved in counter-terrorism operations from its very onset in the 1940s, focusing more on internal rather than external threats. It is also adept in dealing with threats emanating from conflicts that are based on race and religion. Unlike other security agencies such as the Police, the Indonesian military was always viewed as the \u2018senior partner\u2019 due to its historical role in helping to win national independence from the Dutch in 1949 through an armed struggle that was led by the Army. Historically, this also meant that the other security agencies were disadvantaged from the perspective of experience in counter-terrorism, intelligence assets as well as a military structure that extended to the entire length and breadth of the Indonesian archipelago. From this perspective, not only is the Indonesian military the most experienced counter-terrorism specialist in the country, it is also the most experienced and with the longest history of involvement in dealing with this particular non-traditional security threat compared to other armies in the Asia-Pacific, especially China, India and Vietnam which were more preoccupied with external threats.",

In fact, the militaries in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines and Burma/Myanmar have spent the bulk of their history in overcoming domestic threats, be it from insurgencies led by communists, regional separatists or Islamists as in Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines even though it is only the Indonesian military that was almost totally preoccupied with internal rather than external threats .",

A threat-free ASEAN achieved from within will be able to serve as a more effective security organisation in performing tasks to enhance regional security at the Asia-Pacific level, especially in managing or mitigating rivalries and even conflicts among the great powers, for instance, the USA and China over the South China Sea region. Furthermore, this is not a novel idea or practice as almost every military in the Asia-Pacific is undertaking operations of one kind or another to tackle non-traditional security threats. To that extent, the more effectively Asia-Pacific militaries perform their tasks of tackling non-traditional security threats, at least as far as ASEAN is concerned, the more its centrality within the regional security architecture\nin the Asia-Pacific will be enhanced and guaranteed.",

Generally, while military cooperation has been growing among Asian states, there are still many areas that can be enhanced and improved. While there are many sensitivities involved in military-to-military cooperation, mainly due to past conflicts and unresolved territorial disputes, defence diplomacy in general and military cooperation in particular, especially in counter-terrorism, is a potential growth area. This is all the more urgent as there is a growing perception of the Islamic State and its terrorism as the common threat to all Asian states. Some of the possible areas of cooperation would involve the Special Forces and Counter-Terrorism Units of various militaries in the Asia-Pacific conducting bilateral and multilateral exercises. This can later expand to sharing of best practices, intelligence and if need be, when the opportunities avail themselves, for joint operations, especially in the common border regions. Through these endeavours, the importance and centrality of the Asia-Pacific militaries in tackling non-traditional security threats, especially terrorism, can be enhanced.",
