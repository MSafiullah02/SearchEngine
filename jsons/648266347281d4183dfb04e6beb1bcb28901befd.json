            "text": "With about 1 in 10 deaths in India being caused by injuries, it is no wonder that trauma and orthopedic applications have become crucial to improving the country's health outcomes. 8 Bioceramic, metallic, and polymeric biomaterials have all been used to try to address these needs. However, they all face challenges in their application. Bioceramic implants typically exhibit poor resistance against fatigue failure and low fracture toughness, which poses a problem for bone-repairing purposes. Due to their elasticity mismatch with bone, metallic materials will lead to stress-shielding and bone resorption. Polymeric materials possess a low modulus of elasticity, which limits their applications as well. 9 Fig. 3 .1 Bamboo charcoal surface morphology, two views via SEM micrograph (Hsieh et al. (2007) As a result, bamboo has emerged as a promising biomaterial for bone repair and replacement applications. Researchers have found that there are many structural similarities between bamboo and human long bones. For example, bamboo has a gradient structure in the radial direction resembling the bone's gradient structure from outer cortical to inner spongy bone, indicating the potential application of bamboo for bone fracture fixation. In addition, across the bamboo stem (for the bamboo Phyllostachys bambusoides), the average modulus elasticity is 18 GPa, which is the same as the value for human cortical bone. Bamboo also has fairly high longitudinal tensile, bending, and compressive strengths, all of which are necessary for a good biomaterial meant to repair or replace a load-bearing bone. 10 The fact that bamboo also possesses silicon on the inner and outer surfaces of its stem means that it may have an easier time conducting bone mineralization. 11 Plus, studies have shown that the porous nature of bamboo can help with the ingrowth and anchorage of bone. 12 One study demonstrated that, owing to its silica components, bamboo is able to induce precipitation of calcium phosphate in vitro. This is a particularly significant development because many scientists believe that the formation of such an apatite layer is necessary for a biomaterial to properly bond to bone. After chemically removing surface fatty substances, the researchers grafted the bamboo with a polyethylene glycol-based polymer that can facilitate calcification because its polyether soft segment polymer can cause metal-ion chelation. The grafted bamboo samples were then soaked in one of two calcification solutions: accelerated calcification solution (ACS) or simulated body fluid (SBF). The bamboo then formed continuous layers of calcium phosphate, a major component of human bone. Although the bamboo did possess some cytotoxic leachable components that could pose a threat to patients, they could be largely removed by ethanol, methanol, and toluene. 13 In another study, charcoal bamboo (Bambusae glaucescens) was specially fired, sterilized, and shaped before being inserted in the resected tibial diaphysis of white rabbits. At 6 weeks, there was neobone invasion into the bamboo's pores, and good bony ingrowth was seen months later. Another promising finding was that there was no evidence of fibro-encapsulation or inflammatory response in the bone marrow or at the area where the bone and bamboo made contact. 14 Therefore, charcoal bamboo was found to be a suitable alternative bone substitute, and future studies should explore potential applications in humans. 10 Li et al.

            "text": "Neurological disorders are becoming an increasingly significant problem in Indian health. Based on prevalence studies of common neurological disorders conducted among rural and urban populations in the Bangalore region, some researchers have estimated that between 20 and 30 million Indians suffer from neurological disorders of various sorts. One study conducted in 1987 and replicated in 2004 revealed a nearly five-fold increase in the incidence of Parkinson's disease over that time period, from 0.07 to 0.33 per 1,000 people. 15 Bamboo has demonstrated the potential to protect against neuronal damage and neurodegenerative disorders-such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases-where inflammation and oxidative stress are implicated. A relatively recent development in the effort to combat such diseases is the strategy of attenuating the transduction of apoptotic signals in order to prevent neuronal cell death. 16 Studies have shown that one way to go about doing this is to use lignin, a durable network polymer that accounts for 20-30 % of global plant biomass, making it the second most abundant organic plant substance. 17 Scientists have devised a system to convert lignin into derivatives including lignophenols, which are very active, stable, and phenolic. These lignophenols demonstrated impressive neuro-protective abilities against oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. In one study, lig-8-a lignocresol derived from bamboo-derived the strongest neuro-protective activity against hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis in human neuroblastoma cells. Lig-8 also showed an anti-apoptotic effect by impeding the dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane permeability transition. In addition, flow cytometry revealed that lig-8 exhibited antioxidant properties in the cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide. Therefore, bamboo-derived lig-8 has the potential to be an effective neuro-protector, altering the signaling pathway of neuronal cell death and slowing the progress of neurodegenerative diseases. 18 Another study has demonstrated the potential of lig-8 to protect against neuronal damage caused by several other sources: oxygen-glucose deprivation followed by re-oxygenation, tunicamycin, and proteasome inhibitor. The study examined the activity of lig-8 in two scenarios of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) stress-induced neurotoxicity, which may be related to endoplasmic reticulum stress. The first was in the common neuronal differentiation model of pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells while the second was in vivo against retinal damage-induced mice. The tunicamycin-a glycosylation inhibitor that is cytotoxic to many cells 19 -induces cell death in PC12 cells. The proteasome inhibitor (PSI) also induces cell death, but in human neuroblastoma cells. Gourie-Devi (2008) . 16 Akao et al. (2004) . 17 Ito et al. (2006) . 18 Akao et al. (2004) . 19 Varki et al. (1999) . demonstrated impressive neuro-protective effects in each case. OGD-induced cell damage displayed an inverse relationship to the concentration of lig-8 applied, with lig-8 at a 30 lM concentration demonstrating the same level of cell viability as the control PC12 cells. Lig-8 also inhibited tunicamycin-induced cell death in PC12 cultures, with the greatest neuro-protective effect occurring at a concentration of approximately 3 lM. Lig-8 treatment also substantially decreased PSIinduced apoptotic cell death in SH-SY5Y cells.",

However, there was still some discomfort associated with these bandages and their preparation was too time-consuming and challenging to teach and learn. In addition, although the BPPBs cost less than $1, they were still out of many patients' price range. 27 Large, inexpensive, and easily attainable, the leaves of banana plants were found to address many of these problems. The leaves were cut down their midribs and pasted onto bandage cloth with a flour-based paste before being autoclaved for use in patients along with a topical agent. These banana leaf dressings (BLD) were compared to BPPBs in a 30 patient trial and found to be generally similar or superior. There were no significant differences between the two materials with respect to days taken for epithelialization, eschar formation, the need for skin to graft over deep partial thickness burns, or microbe growth. Images of the banana leaf dressings are shown in Fig. 3 .2. Since minimal discomfort was experienced and the BLD was easier to prepare and 1/11th the cost of the BPPB, this bananabased biomaterial proved to be a promising development in the field of burn dressings (See foot note 27).",

AIDS-related causes have claimed the lives of almost 30 million people already, and the virus has deleteriously affected the lives Fig. 3 .2 Prepared banana leaf dressing above boiled potato peel bandage (left) and BLD applied to right leg of patient, 13 days post-burn (right). Gore and Akolekar (2003) 27 Gore and Akolekar (2003) . of countless others. 28 This global HIV epidemic has not overlooked India. Current HIV estimates in India range from 1.5 to 3 million infected people. 29, 30 In addition, even though over 25 anti-HIV drugs were approved and availability of antiretroviral (ARV) therapies had been improving in low-and middle-income countries, by 2008, the rate of new HIV-1 infections was 2.5 times greater than the rate of new individuals receiving ARV drugs. 31 An effective HIV vaccine may be many years away and condoms-though useful in combating the spread of HIVare often used incorrectly or inconsistently, particularly in areas where women have less control over their sexual activity. Therefore, the development of intravaginal or intrarectal microbicides may be a good alternative. 32 In fact, some predict that over just 3 years, covering one-fifth of the population with a 60 % effective microbicide could prevent up to 2.5 million new HIV infections. 33 Several promising HIV transmission inhibitors block the virus before it integrates its genome into the target cell. Lectins-proteins that can recognize and bind carbohydrates without altering them-are able to inhibit the HIV-1 entry step by binding to the viral envelope's carbohydrate structures. 34 One HIV-1 envelope protein, called gp120, is an attractive target because it contains multiple sites for glycosylation, a process crucial to the viral life cycle. Studies have shown that banana lectin (BanLec) is able to bind to high mannose structures on gp120 to prevent the cellular attachment and entry of HIV. Cells treated with BanLec demonstrated lower levels of strong-stop DNA, an early HIV reverse transcription product that can often be detected between when the virus enters the cell and when the virus is uncoated. In addition, although most of banana lectin's HIV inhibitory activity derives from its ability to block viral attachment, some HIV inhibition was still observed when BanLec was added after attachment. 35 Therefore, BanLec could also be useful in preventing HIV transmission through post-attachment steps including virus fusion to the cell.",

            "text": "Using BanLec as an anti-HIV agent could also be effective because lectins can hinder the development of resistance by targeting multiple different glycosylation sites on the virus. Research has shown that for resistance to develop, many more mutations in the envelope sequence are needed than are typical. Administering a combination of different lectins would further reduce the chances that a lectinbased anti-viral therapy would fail due to resistance. Even if the virus developed a resistance to BanLec and other lectins, it is possible that this would increase its vulnerability to the normal human immune response. This is because the changes 28 Swanson et al. (2010) . 33 Watts (2002) . 34 Meagher et al. (2005) . 35 Swanson et al. (2010). in glycosylation that allow the virus to develop resistance to lectins also increase its susceptibility to neutralizing antibody responses. 36 Studies have shown that banana lectin microbicides have demonstrated the capacity to be as powerful as two major microbicides that have been developed. However, the BanLec treatments are less expensive and do not demonstrate the same side effects associated with those two. 37 Although there are still some safety concerns that need to be explored with BanLec, attaching recombinant therapeutic proteins to the lectin's polymer chains have been shown to reduce toxicity and alter bioavailability. Banana lectin also has potential antiviral applications beyond HIV. Glycosylation is a process crucial to other viruses as well, not just HIV-1. Particular lectins have already demonstrated inhibitory behavior with respect to viruses such as Ebola, hepatitis C, influenza, Marburg, and SARS coronavirus. BanLec could possibly be applied to combat the spread of such viruses as well. 38 Therefore, banana lectin has exhibited potential to inhibit the transmission of viruses, particularly HIV. Bio-derived applications of this and other lectins should be explored to develop methods to better combat the spread of infectious disease, such as intravaginal microbicides to reduce HIV transmission.",

Affecting 1 of every 20 people worldwide, gastric ulcers are thought to be caused by an imbalance between luminal acid and pepsin on one side and the mucosal layer, phospholipid layer, prostaglandins, and other factors on the other side. Many researchers are currently looking for more effective ways to treat gastric ulcers, which can be caused by such diverse factors as stress, nutritional deficiencies, and nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory drugs. 45 Multiple studies have demonstrated the protective effects that unripe plantain banana extract can have on gastric mucosa at risk for aspirin-induced damage. Therefore, a study was undertaken to examine the anti-ulcerogenic properties of the unripe plantain banana extract and its potentially active ingredient, the flavonoid leucocyanidin. The chemical structure of leucocyanidin is shown in Fig. 3 .4. Active banana powder was prepared by drying fresh pulp at temperatures below 40\u00b0C.This study showed that an aqueous, leucocyanidin-rich extract exhibited substantial anti-ulcerogenic properties, even when exposed to artificial gastric juice. The anti-ulcerogenic properties of such flavonoids have been partially explained by their reduction of acid secretion by gastric parietal cells. 46 This demonstrates the anti-ulcerogenic potential of banana-based compounds and further exploration of the topic could yield important therapeutic applications for human ulcer treatment. 45 Rony et al.

In addition, the increase in iron absorption was not accompanied by a change in the digesta's pH or phytase activity, which could have negative effects on other digestive and absorptive properties. Since pigs have a similar anatomy and physiology of the gastrointestinal tract as humans and their iron status can be easily manipulated by iron injection dosages, these animals are a good model through which to study human iron absorption. 50 Studies have also shown that inulin enhances iron absorption and retention as well as hemoglobin repletion efficiency and hemoglobin recovery from anemia in rats. 51 Therefore, banana inulin-based therapeutics have good potential to reduce iron deficiency in humans and lower the burden of anemia in India.",

This has become a substantial problem with the increasing percentage of people who are overweight or obese from excess dietary energy intake, which can induce insulin resistance. 54 Coconut is a rich source of D-xylose, a monosaccharide that is thought to suppress the postprandial glucose surge. This could be a very important tool in treatments to combat obesity-related diseases, an area where postprandial hyperglycemia is believed to play a significant role. 55 This sucrase inhibitor has been shown to lower intestinal sucrose activity by over 50 % in rats. 56 D-xylose in 5 g and 7.5 g doses has also lessened increases in serum glucose and insulin levels and slowed down glucose absorption in a study of 49 humans.",

Results showed that serum glucose levels after 30 min were substantially lower among those subjects who were administered xylose. Similarly, after 15 min, mean serum insulin was far lower in the test group. All of this indicates that coconut-derived D-xylose can be used to positively alter the postprandial glucose and insulin response and successfully inhibit the effects of obesity-and diabetes-related conditions. 57 With respect to diabetes specifically, coconut has also demonstrated significant anti-diabetic effects. Research has shown that the hydro-methanol extract of Cocos nucifera (HECN) exhibited an anti-hyperglycemic effect in streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetic rats that was comparable to that of gilbenclamide, a common anti-diabetic drug. It is thought that HECN's glucose-lowering abilities might be due to an increase in pancreatic insulin secretion from existing beta cells or release from bound insulin. 58 The diabetic rats demonstrated elevated levels of triglyceride (TG) and cholesterol along with decreased HL levels. This could be due to an insulin shortage that activated lipase enzymes to hydrolyze stored TG and release fatty acids and glycerol into the blood. Increased TG and cholesterol in the rats' blood could result in cardiovascular disease. However, treatment with HECN improved the rats' lipid 52 Bae et al. (2011) . 53 Gavin (2001) . 54 Bae et al.

HECN treatment helped restore elevated levels of particular biomarker enzymes indicative of impaired liver function-such as serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), and serum alkaline phosphatase (SALP)-to normal levels, indicating decreased diabetic complications. Treatment with HECN also inhibited hepatic lipid peroxidation levels and boosted liver antioxidant parameters towards non-diabetic levels, thereby resulting in less tissue injury and fewer pathologic complications of diabetes. 59 Thus, hydro-methanol extract of Cocos nucifera has demonstrated significant anti-diabetic and lipid profile improvement abilities that can be further explored for therapeutic application in humans.",

This massive burden of helminth infection, particularly on the developing world, has spurred investigations of various ways to prevent and get rid of the parasites. Research has demonstrated that coconut possesses anti-helminthic properties. One study selected naturally infected sheep in three different locations-Egypt, Germany, and Saudi Arabia-to test the anti-helminthic effects of several crops in differing geographies. After being fed 60 g coconut endosperm powder and 60 g onion powder with their food each day for eight days, the animals with gastrointestinal nematodes and cestodes no longer had any worm stages in their feces, as observed on days 9 and 20.

Subcutaneous injections of indomethacin led to ulceration in male rats, and the cytoprotective abilities of coconut water, coconut milk, and sucralfate (a conventional cytoprotective medicine used for treating ulcers) were compared. While coconut water resulted in a 39 % reduction in mean ulcer area, coconut milk resulted in a 54 % reduction, which is nearly the same as the 56 % result produced by sucralfate. The difference between the sucralfate and coconut milk results were not statistically significant, so they are considered to have essentially the same effect. Thus, utilizing properties of coconut milk could prove to be an effective means to treat gastritis and ulceration, and its low cost could be more suited to developing countries like India. 64",

This is particularly true in many areas of the developing world, where more advanced treatment fluids might be too expensive or difficult to access. 65 Found as a free fluid inside the coconut, coconut water is an acidic solution comprised mainly of amino acids, electrolytes, and sugars. Its electrolytic components-rich in calcium, chloride, magnesium, and potassium-are similar to those of intracellular fluid, while its sodium content is 63 Mehlhorn et al. (2010) . 64 Nneli and Woyike (2008) . 65 Campbell-Falck (2000) . lower than human plasma. 66 Such properties indicate coconut water's potential application for total parenteral nutrition (TPN) under particular circumstances. 67 Coconut water has even been used in large volumes as a resuscitating and hydrating intravenous fluid during conflicts ranging from World War II to the Nigerian civil war of the 1960s. 68 Studies have demonstrated its successful use in cases where infusion over the course of 6 to 12 h totaled 3 liters of coconut water. 69 Since green coconut water is usually sterile, it is well-suited to intravenous use, but it can also be used as a culture medium in microbiology and plant biology. 70 In humans, the coconut water displayed similarities to a hypotonic intracellular fluid, and possessed slightly more than one half of the typical human blood plasma's cation or anion content. 71 Such high concentrations were found to be quite safe and did not cause any negative coagulation initiation processes. 72 Although coconut water may not be precisely on par with standard TPN solutions, it is a viable low-tech, low-cost solution that could increase health care access if used as an intravenous fluid.",

Diarrhea, dermatosis, anemia, and asthma can all be treated with jackfruit leaves and roots, which can also be used as an expectorant for coughs. 73 Oftentimes, biomaterial and therapeutic applications explore the fruit or leaves of a plant. But since jackfruit is a rubber-producing plant, all parts of the jackfruit tree contain a sticky aqueous emulsion-latex-that also has important medical applications. 74 From the milky latex of the Artocarpus heterophyllus fruit stem, researchers have used heat precipitation and anion exchange chromatography to purify a heat-stable heteromultimeric glycoprotein (HSGPL1) that can act as a protease inhibitor. This protein can alter the human blood coagulation system's intrinsic pathways by increasing the activated partial thrombin time (APTT) and inhibiting particular blood coagulation factors, called XIa and a-XIIa. 75 The process by which human blood clots can be explained via three pathways: intrinsic, extrinsic, and common. 76 APTT is a way to measure the functions of the latter two pathways, representing how long human plasma takes to clot after an intrinsic pathway activator, phospholipid, and calcium have been added. 77 In addition, HSGPL1 contributes to the maintenance of homeostasis in cells under both optimal and adverse growth conditions. These glycoproteins can help proteins refold under conditions of stress and they can also assist with stabilizing proteins and membranes. 78 75 Siritapetawee and Thammasirirak (2011) . 76 Brown (1988) . 77 Shih et al. (2010) . 78 Siritapetawee and Thammasirirak (2011). Therefore, this jackfruit-derived protein could be extremely useful for the diagnosis or treatment of hemorrhagic or thrombotic conditions. Potential applications for HSGPL1 include treatment for fibrinolysis (which prevents blood clot formation), wound healing, and blood coagulation. 79 This is especially important given the extremely high cost of many treatments currently offered in the market. 80",

Sodium starch glycolate (SSG) and crosscarmellose sodium (CCS) are two common commercial superdisintegrants used today.

Flow cytometry revealed that ArtinM was able to bind to over 95 % of these leukemia cells, likely due to the modification of NB4's surface glycans caused by malignant transformation. In addition, MTT assays indicated that NB4 cells were quite sensitive to ArtinM inhibition, with a 10 lg/mL concentration of the lectin reducing leukemia cell growth by half. NB4 cells cultured with ArtinM at this concentration for two days, at which point the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. The lectin caused the pronounced surface exposition of phosphatidylserine, a phospholipid component generally located on the inside of the cell membrane. Hence, this analysis revealed signs of cellular apoptosis. ArtinM treatment also disrupted the mitochondrial transmembrane electrical potential in these leukemia cells. 86 ArtinM was also compared to all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), the main pharmacological component of APL therapy. 87 Unlike drugs like ATRA, ArtinM was able to induce NB4 cell death without cell maturation. In addition, ArtinM treatment generated high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can lead to depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane translocation of apoptotic factors from the mitochondria to the nucleus. Therefore, the high ROS levels caused by ArtinM treatment can also induce leukemic cell death. 88 Therefore the jackfruit-derived lectin ArtinM has demonstrated the ability to mediate the death of human leukemia cells, a property that should be further explored in future studies as a potential mechanism by which to treat leukemia. 84 Misquith et al.

Nevertheless, jute has reemerged as an effective wound dressing, in the form of a composite with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). This hydrogel-based option is being developed in Bangladesh as a much more cost-effective option than many synthetic dressings currently available. The final product is intended to be even less expensive than similar hydrogel dressings based on a combination of agar, polyethylene glycol (PEG), and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). 89 In addition, other jute-based dressing options are being explored due to its mechanical properties. Its tenacity, defined as the force required to break the fiber, can be more than three times higher than cotton's and six times greater than that of wool. 90 Such mechanical properties make jute a fiber worth exploring for future wound dressing applications.",

Five groups of six rats were given daily administrations, respectively, of: double distilled water for 15 days; arsenic (10 mg/kg) for 10 days; AECO (50 mg/kg) for 15 days followed by arsenic (10 mg/kg) for 10 days; AECO (100 mg/kg) for 15 days followed by arsenic (10 mg/kg) for 10 days; and quercetin (a weakly acidic flavonoid commonly found in nature 94 ) at 10 mg/kg for 15 days followed by arsenic (10 mg/kg) for 10 days. Their excised brains were then compared. 95 AECO treatment significantly decreased lipid peroxidation, likely through chemical mechanisms such as free radical quenching, electron transfer, or radical recombination. Probably owing to intrinsic antioxidant properties, AECO also helped combat the changes in levels of brain antioxidant enzymes-including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione reductase (GR)-that arsenic exposure caused. These antioxidant enzymes are considered the first line of cellular defense against oxidative damage, so their restoration to normal levels is critical. Arsenic administration also negatively affected the levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG), cellular metabolites in the brain tissue that act as an additional line of defense. However, AECO treatment before the arsenic exposure helped rats prevent the toxin-induced alteration and maintain levels closer to normal, a result likely owing to the jute extract's free radical scavenging abilities. Figure 3 .7 demonstrates the effect of AECO on two of the compounds previously discussed glutathione reductase and oxidized glutathione. In both cases, the (2012). 95 Das et al. (2009). rats treated with AECO demonstrated substantially less damage than in the toxin control, and they were nearly at the same level as the standard quercetin.",

Tossa jute also demonstrated substantially higher swelling, water-holding, oil-holding, and cation exchange capacities in comparison to shiitake. This is especially noteworthy because insoluble fibers with higher swelling or water-holding capacities have increased digesta viscosities due to reduced digesta free water content. In rats that were administered tossa jute fibers, the gastric, small intestinal, and caecal digesta viscosities were nine, three, and one times (respectively) greater than those of rats that received crystalline cellulose fibers. Hence, insoluble jute fibers have demonstrated their effectiveness in raising digestive viscosity and altering digestion and nutritional absorption as a result. 102",

However, porosity often poses a challenge. 120 Rice husk, an abundant material typically regarded as waste, could help solve this problem. In the 2006-2007 year alone, 80 million tons of rice husk were produced, meaning that every 5 tons of rice production yielded approximately 1 ton of rice husk. Rice husk is often used for bedding or burned to generate energy, the latter of which adds to environmental pollution. 121 But scientists have discovered a new biomedical application for this waste material. In bioactive glass and glass-ceramic scaffolds, powdered rice husk can be used as an additive to form pores that will contribute to bone growth.",

In fact, corneal diseases such as infective keratitis are the second largest cause of vision loss and blindness. This is a particularly large problem in India, where the incidence of corneal infections has been reported at 10 times that of the United States. 128 Corneal blindness is a substantial problem in Indian public health, with many people sustaining corneal injuries from infections, childhood fevers, or chemical injuries that lead to vision loss. 129 Such damage often requires a corneal graft to restore vision. As of 2005, corneal grafts were the most common type of tissue transplant in the US, where nearly 10 million people were suffering from vision loss as a result of corneal blindness. 130 However, within 5 years of implantation, about 1 in 4 patient immune systems rejects the corneal graft. 131 Silk proteins have significant potential for such corneal tissue engineering applications. In order to develop a new biomaterial option with lower rejection rates, scientists have begun to study silk fibroin, a structural protein from the Bombyx mori silkworm cocoon. This protein exhibits controllable degradation rates, non-immunogenic responses in implantation, and robust mechanical properties, making it a suitable candidate for corneal tissue replacement. 132 Silk fibroin is also one of the strongest, toughest natural fibers known to man. 133 Fibroin can be used to create transparent, patterned biomaterials that allow sight and provide a surface to help direct cellular function and matrix deposition. 134, 135 Unlike materials such as synthetic polyglycolic acid or natural collagen, the biodegradation rates of silk fibroin can be manipulated to allow extra time for native tissue to remodel. 136 In addition, biopolymers like collagen and fibrin involve complex processing steps and are difficult to transform into mechanically stable structures, whereas silk is much easier to manipulate and it forms a very robust structure.",

They have created free-standing films between 10 and 100 lm in thickness with transmission across the visible spectrum consistently registering above 90 %. Measured diffraction efficiencies of the silk structure gratings compared favorably to the transmissive glass gratings often used today. 138 In addition, the unique processing technique required to create these optical silk structures means that they can be designed to more easily incorporate biologically active elements in a manner that poses less of a risk (in terms of potential toxic chemical leaching) to biomedical applications than current systems, which often involve methanol. Research showed that a number of biological substancesincluding physiologically relevant proteins, enzymes, and small organic pH indicators-could be successfully embedded in the silk films.

Hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying protein inside the red blood cells, was able to maintain activity within the silk structure's matrix, as demonstrated by optical transmission experiments. To study the inclusion of enzymes in the silk films, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was added to the silk solution along with an organic monomer called TMB that changes color in the presence of HRP. Measurements showed that HRP was still active within the silk structure's matrix up to 45 days after initial preparation of the grating. In order to evaluate the silk structure's compatibility with small molecules, Phenol Red, an organic pH indicator, was incorporated. The resulting diffractive optic structures were able to retain both the indicator's functionality and the optical function of the diffraction grating. 139 The silk structure's biocompatible nature and ability to completely biodegrade is also critical. These characteristics enable the structure's use in devices that could unobtrusively enter and monitor an environment such as a human body. The silk's degradation time could be manipulated such that the device could be used for remote sensing and detection systems but would safely degrade in the environment at an appropriate time, thereby sparing a patient an invasive surgery or other extraction process. Such devices could include everything from an internal glucose meter to hydrogen peroxide detectors.

But researchers have been struggling to construct the ideal conduit, one that is environmentally compatible and can be easily created in the desired size, that promotes axonal regeneration with a supportive luminal scaffold, and that protects regenerating axons from scar tissue infiltration. 145 The luminal scaffold issue has proven especially tricky, particularly since there are no conduits with luminal scaffolds in clinical use today. 146 Recently produced silk-based conduits might help solve this problem. These conduits-which consist of a tube of regenerated Bombyx mori silk protein with a luminal scaffold of spider silk-like biomaterial filaments-were shown to promote neurite growth. 147 Figure 3 .12 shows close up images of such a silk-based conduit. When compared to a non-silk-based nerve guide of poly-3 hydroxybutyrate (PHB) tube, the silk-based conduit performed better in the spinal ganglia of male rats. Approximately 1 month after surgery, axonal labeling mid-conduit was 62 % of the autologous graft, as opposed to 58 % with the PHB conduit. 148 A study using polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), silicone, and nerve autograft to bridge a 10 mm gap in a rabbit sciatic nerve showed an average axon count of 48 % in the distal nerve after 13-15 weeks for the PTFE group compared to the nerve graft. 149 Silk conduits, however resulted in 81 % of the number of myelinated axons at 12 weeks, compared to autologous controls. 150 With respect to biodegradability, three of the five types of conduits presently FDA-approved for clinical nerve repair are either non-biodegradable or degrade in as little as 8 weeks, which might be too soon to support axonal growth across long gaps. On the other hand, the silk-based conduits are predicted to be resorbed within 1 year, a timeframe more suited to longer distance repairs. In addition, silk conduits did not trigger a major inflammatory tissue response, which could be a significant advantage over some synthetic nerve guidance channels that elicited a chronic inflammatory response. 151 Therefore, silk-based conduits could prove to be an excellent candidate for clinical nerve regenerative applications in the future. This is particularly important given that an international panel of nearly fifty experts recently ranked nerve regeneration technologies as the 9th most important regenerative medicine application for improving health in developing countries. 152",

            "text": "Silk-based scaffolds with a similar lamellar structure as bone have been designed that are useful for tissue engineering and bone regeneration. 153 In particular, clay montmorillonite and sodium silicate on a silk fibroin organic scaffold offers a mechanically stable scaffold for bone growth. 154 For large bone defects, autologous bone transplants can be used to regenerate the bone, but this method is usually dismissed in favor of biomaterial usage in order to avoid the additional pain, conformal needs at the repair site, longer rehabilitation times, and second site morbidity associated with such transplants. 155 Numerous biomaterials have therefore been studied for this purpose, and collagens have emerged as a suitable biomaterial. Collagens are a natural polymer source that reflect the major source of proteins in the extracellular matrix of bone and interact well with tissue, but they do not possess long-term mechanical stability or integrity. 156 Therefore, silk has emerged as a better possible alternative. Silk possesses extraordinary mechanical properties: for example, silk fibers can absorb approximately the same amount of energy before failure as Kevlar. 157 In addition, purified silk is highly compatible and can demonstrate very slow degradation times. 158 Hence, researchers tested silk fibroin-based scaffolds seeded with human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) to promote sustainable bone growth to test their effectiveness in bone regeneration. 159 These scaffolds created a protein matrix that could slowly degrade and allow for some degree of control over hydroxyapatite bone mineral deposition over time. In bioreactor studies, this enabled the creation of a bone matrix similar to that of spongy bone. According to biochemical assays, gene expression analysis, and X-ray diffractometry, the organic and inorganic components of bone tissues engineered in this manner were quite similar to those of bone. These silk-based, tissue-engineered implants were grown in bioreactors for 5 weeks before introduction into 7-week old mice with circular defects (4 mm in diameter) in their skulls. Within 5 weeks of implantation, the tissue-engineered bone implants demonstrated advanced bone formation. Levels of osteopontin (a sialoprotein that can bind calcium and hydroxyapatite and facilitate cell adherence) and osteocalcin (a secretion of osteoblasts, which are largely responsible for proper bone formation) were also quite high. Thus, in conjunction with engineered bone, silk-based implants have demonstrated sizable promise for effective osteogenesis in a mechanically stable manner. 160 In addition, sonication-induced silk hydrogels have been created as injectable bone replacements. Studies have evaluated sonication-induced silk hydrogels encapsulating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF 165 ) and bone morphogenic protein-2 (BMP-2)-two important regulators of angiogenesis and osteogenesis during bone regeneration-for slow release. A study performed on 24 male rabbits with irregularly shaped sinuses showed that these silk-based hydrogels promoted good bone formation and had advantages over current methods, including good plasticity, minimal invasion, simple preparation, and short utility at operation time. In addition, this method was quite simple to use, since its injectable form enabled easier administration given smaller bone windows. The release of VEGF 165 and BMP-2, which were used to quantify growth factor release from silk gels, demonstrated an impressive ability to resist ''bursts'' and release the factors according to sustained kinetics over the course of at least 4 weeks. Therefore, silk hydrogels have exhibited potential for use as a minimally invasive means to deliver multiple growth factors via injection to specific locations and assist with bone regeneration in irregular cavities. 161",

            "text": "Beads, hydrogels, and nanoparticles from silk fibroin matrices have also been used for drug delivery. 162 For example, silk fibroin and polyacrylamide semi 159 Meinel et al. (2005b) . 160 . 161 Zhang et al. (2011) . 162 Bhardwaj et al. (2011). interpenetrating network (semi-IPN) hydrogels have been synthesized to serve as a matrix for sustained drug release with improved mechanical strength and greater drug immobilization capabilities than plain hydrogels. This type of hydrogel was easily fabricated and manipulated with respect to factors such as degradation, mechanical strength, porosity, and swelling. When drug release tested using two model compounds-trypan blue dye and fluorescence isothiocyanate labeled inulin (FITC-Inulin)-the hydrogels demonstrated good release kinetics, though factors such as molecular weight, water solubility, and polymer ratios all influenced the outcomes. 163 Silk fibroin beads created from scaffolds embedding calcium drug delivery demonstrated the success of silk in dual drug delivery applications. It was able to control and release two model compounds of different molecular weights-bovine serum albumin (BSA) and FITC-Inulin-independently and in a sustained manner. The silk in these systems also helped slow down the drug release to enable sustained delivery and avoid rapid initial bursts. Thus, these silk-based beads have successfully demonstrated a way to deliver multiple active drug molecules from a single delivery system in a regulated manner, a development that could be very important to improvements in modern drug delivery systems. 164 Spherical silk fibroin nanoparticles for drug delivery purposes have also been formulated from both mulberry silkworms (Bombyx mori) and non-mulberry silkworms (Antheraea mylitta). Confocal laser scanning microscopy with the FITC-tagged nanoparticles demonstrated their cellular uptake in murine squamous cell carcinoma cells in less than 1 h. Most of these nanoparticles were endocytosed and found in the cytoplasm near the nuclear membrane, where they were able to remain stable. The non-mulberry fibroin nanoparticles were also used to study vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) release. VEGF was quite easily loaded into the nanoparticles and the silk allowed for a more controlled, sustained release in comparison to a control system without silk nanoparticles. This demonstrated the nanoparticles' potential for future use in therapeutic drug delivery systems. 165 Non-mulberry Antheraea mylitta silk sericin protein has also been used with amphiphilic poloxamers to create self-assembled micellar nanoparticles for targeted delivery of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs. FITC-inulin was used to study hydrophilic drug carrying abilities. Nanoparticles successfully encapsulated the drug and demonstrated enhanced stability after 10 days of incubation. To observe their behavior as a hydrophobic drug carrier, the nanoparticles were loaded with paclitaxel, an extremely effective anticancer agent. Treatment of breast cancer MCF-7 cells with the paclitaxel-loaded nanoparticles substantially reduced cell growth and increased cell death. Although drug loading was not as high as for free paclitaxel drug delivery, these silk-based nanoparticles may still be preferable because free paclitaxel is less soluble and has a high affinity to other 163 Mandal et al. (2009) . 164 Mandal and Kundu (2009a) . 165 Kundu et al. (2010) . plasma proteins. Therefore, even at lower concentrations, the drug-loaded sericin nanoparticles can directly enter cells and display functionality, lowering the risk of side effects related to high drug dosages. 166",

It is also a substantial source of morbidity, with 9.2 million potentially productive years of life lost in 2000 due to cardiovascular conditions and the number of hypertensive individuals expected to surge to 214 million in 2025. 169 The severity of cardiovascular disease in India has also led to an increase in cardiovascular surgical procedures, including the implanting of stents. In particular, drug-eluting stents have become increasingly common. India has become one of the fastest-growing markets for drug-eluting stents in the world, with over 150,000 such stents implanted in the country every year. 170 Despite the benefits brought about by stent implantations, the deep vascular injury and endothelial cell damage caused by the procedure in conjunction with long-term exposure to the foreign metallic device often leads to excess vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation, thrombosis (formation of a blood clot in a blood vessel or occlusion of the stent), 171 and restenosis (decreased lumen diameter after percutaneous coronary intervention) 172, 173 However, scientists have successfully developed a silk-coated stent capable of releasing drugs over time to alleviate these conditions. Multiple coatings of Bombyx mori silk fibroin were loaded with heparin-a naturally occurring anticoagulant also used to coat catheters, metallic stents, and other devices 174 -as well as the chemotherapy drug paclitaxel and the anti-platelet agent clopidogrel to examine their anti-coagulative properties as well as their anti-proliferative effects on smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells. These drug-eluting devices were able to regulate adhesion, viability, and growth of human aortic endothelial cells as well as human coronary artery SMCs in vitro. They also did not compromise on their ''primary'' function, successfully expanding and holding open the arteries just like regular stents. 175 In addition, in vivo studies of a porcine aorta revealed that the silk coatings maintained integrity after implantation and were able to successfully reduce platelet adhesion to the coatings, due to their drug contents. 176 This result is visible in Fig. 3 .13, where less platelet adhesion has occurred on the silk-coated stents with heparin.",

When a bone defect achieves a critical size-as in certain traumatic events or surgical procedures where pathological conditions require bone removal-bone regeneration no longer regenerates spontaneously. Hence there is a need for bone fillers to support bone formation. Human or animal bone grafts (mineralized or non-mineralized) are currently the best option for most of these cases, but such grafts are often in short supply and can increase morbidity and risk of transmittable disease. There are also several categories of synthetic bone fillers which have been shown to support proliferation of boneproducing cells or completely degrade into carbon dioxide and water. However, these two have shortcomings, from brittle mechanical properties to triggering unwanted inflammatory responses. Soybean-based materials offer a simple, inexpensive solution to these problems, as they may exert bioactivity on cells (enhancing tissue regeneration) and they could self-counter any immunogenic response. 178 One manner in which this has been achieved is by thermosetting defatted soybean curd. The resulting biomaterial is very ductile, enabling effective adaptation to the implantation site and providing the damaged tissue with a biocompatible, biodegradable scaffold. In addition, this soybean-based biomaterial has demonstrated the potential to reduce the chronic inflammatory response induced by macrophages while also promoting bone regeneration by stimulating bone cells. The soybean biomaterial's release of particular isoflavones decreased the activity 176 Ibid. 177 Otaigbe (1998) . 178 Santin (2007) . of osteoclasts (the cells responsible for bone resorption) and macrophages, thereby speeding up the healing process. Data also indicates that, when combined with induced collagen synthesis, this soybean-based bone filler is able to set off most of the cellular and biochemical events necessary for synthesizing new mineralized tissue. 179 Therefore, this soybean-based biomaterial may prove to be a relatively inexpensive and easily manufactured bone filler with improved biological and physicochemical characteristics for clinical applications.",

For example, 8 weeks after implantation, the soybean-based bone fillers promoted a higher level of bone in-growth than the PLA/PGA filler in two-thirds of cases. Also, bone in-growth in the rabbits treated with soybean-based filler progressively improved over the 24 week period of study, while the rabbits treated with the commercial filler displayed clear signs of bone resorption by the eighth week. 182 This resorption is likely due to an inflammatory response triggered by small pieces of degraded PLA/PGA filler, a problem that soybean-based fillers did not encounter. 183 However, the soybeanbased biomaterials also encountered some problems. A few rabbits, for instance, demonstrated excessively packed granules. Such models did not permit sufficient bone infiltration and could potentially lead to fibrosis. Nevertheless, this spacing problem is one that could likely be optimized through formula adjustment in order to encourage osteoid infiltration and a progressively mineralizing front. Hence, these soybean-based fillers have demonstrated substantial bone regeneration abilities, likely by using the biomaterial as a scaffold for osteoblasts and inducing cell differentiation. In the future, they could serve as desirable alternatives to methods like autologous bone grafts or PLA/PGA hydrogels, particularly given their ductility and lack of a brittle nature or excessively loose consistency. 184 179 Ibid. 180 Giavaresi et al.

With disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the gastrointestinal tract can be chronically inflamed, leading to such problems as weight loss, gastrointestinal permeability, and digestive tract distress. 185, 186 While there are treatments available for IBD that use drugs and immunosuppressants to target inflammatory molecules, they often have high costs and negative side effects, in addition to occasional low efficacy. 187 Hence, there is currently interest in creating new therapies that are not cytotoxic and can be easily absorbed and disseminated to the site of inflammation while remaining highly effective. Various soy proteins and phytochemicals-including isoflavones, saponins, trypsin inhibitors, and lunasin-have been examined and found to reduce both inflammation and the expression of inflammatory genes in vitro and in vivo. 188 One study examined the effects of soy-derived di-and tri-peptides on pigs, whose gastrointestinal tracts are morphologically and physiologically similar to those of humans. 189 The pigs were treated with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) to induce intestinal inflammation and infused with the peptides via catheter. Although treatment with the soy peptides did not substantially affect symptomatic and growth performance factors linked with inflammation, they did help lessen macroscopic indicators of colonic inflammation and intestinal permeability. Peptides exhibited a protective effect in pig colons, helping them maintain an intact epithelium despite the tissue-erosive effect of DSS. Peptide-treated pigs also demonstrated lower colonic crypt depth than those who only received the DSS and similar muscle thickness to control pigs that received neither DSS nor peptides, indicating that the peptides prohibited their intestines from undergoing the typical damage-and-recover cycle of DSS-treated pigs. In addition, soy peptides substantially lowered TNF protein and expression levels. The suppression of TNF has Fig. 3. 14 Structures of the three model drugs. Xu and Yang (2009) 185 Welcker et al. (2004) . 186 Poritz et al. (2007) . 187 Abraham and Cho (2009) . 188 . 189 Miller and Ullrey (1987) . demonstrated promise for IBD treatment, particularly since intestinal inflammation usually triggers an increase in the expression of TNF and other inflammatory mediators which help release other proinflammatory cytokines, thus drawing out the immune response. The peptides' lowering of levels of the inflammatory mediator IFNG similarly indicates reduced colonic inflammation. Soy-peptide treatment also lowered the levels of cells often associated with Crohn's disease, another common form of IBD. 190 Thus, soy peptides were able to successfully suppress the expression of inflammatory mediators, as shown by the inhibitory effects on histological measurements and gut permeability as well as the intestines' innate proinflammatory pathways. They have demonstrated sufficient therapeutic potential for patients who suffer from intestinal inflammatory conditions. This is especially significant given the prevalence of ulcerative colitis (one of the most common types of IBD) in India, which is atypically high for the region. 191",

Three model drugs-Diclofenac, 5 Fluorouracil (5-Fu), and Metformin-were then loaded onto the SP fibers by both the dissolution and sorption methods. The chemical structures of these drugs are illustrated in Fig. 3 .14. The dissolution method involves dissolving the drug in a molten polymer or polymer solution, while the sorption method requires drug sorption into to a fibrous scaffold after its fabrication. 193 The latter method is considered preferable for SP fibers, since it generally leaves behind fewer impurities in the fibers and enables a higher efficiency of drug utilization. Afterwards, drug release was studied in phosphate buffered saline (PBS with pH 7.4) and artificial gastric juice (AGJ with pH 1.2) solutions in a shaking water bath. 194 This study showed that drug sorption onto the SP fibers was quite good and increased at higher temperatures. This is likely due to the fact that at increased temperatures, the drugs moved faster, the boundary layer on the surface of the SP fibers thinned, and there were smaller aggregates of drugs, all of which enabled quicker, easier movement of drugs into the SP fibers. Higher temperatures can also increase drug sorption by breaking strong interactions between SP molecular chains, allowing drug molecules to enter. In addition, the study found that 5-Fu and Metformin had higher drug sorption rates than Diclofenac, likely due to their smaller size. This is because smaller drugs have an easier time maneuvering through the openings in SP fibers, so they also experience faster drug sorption at a given temperature. 195 When compared to polylactic acid (PLA) fibers and starch acetate (SA) fibers, which also have biomedical applications, SP fibers demonstrated faster rates of Diclofenac sorption due to the larger surface openings their fibers possess as well as stronger forces between the drug and SP fibers. SP fibers are also more hydrophilic than those of PLA or SA, meaning that SP swells and its fibers generate larger openings and wider channels, thereby facilitating faster drug sorption rates. 196 Drug release in PBS was quick, with higher initial bursts from drugs loaded onto SP fibers, but PLA and SA fibers demonstrated more constant subsequent release. However, Diclofenac drug release became much more constant in the AGJ solution (compared to the PBS). Moisture levels played an important role in shaping the constancy of drug release, so that is one factor that could be manipulated in the future to achieve a desired result. Overall, soy protein fibers showed their abilities for drug sorption and release and potential relevant applications in the biomedical field. 197",

It also possesses a lower biodegradability and longer shelf life. 199 This is particularly important for ocular drug delivery, which is considered one of the most challenging areas to scientists due the eye's ''pharmacokinetically critical environment.'' 200 The eye's numerous barriers-such as the corneal epithelium, iris blood vessels, retinal pigment epithelium, and muco-aqueous layer of the tear film-decrease the amount of each pharmaceutical dose that is actually absorbed. 201 Studies have shown that CMTKP displays excellent ocular tolerability and absorptive properties when tested with tropicamide, an agent often used during eye surgeries and examinations. 202 TSP has also been studied in the context of delivery of diclofenac sodium, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug often used as a strong analgesic when treating conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. 203 Although the past few years have seen an increase in attempts to use natural polymers like alginates for drug delivery, such efforts have encountered several problems. For example, with crosslinked alginate hydrogels, the drugs might leak out during gel formation (thereby decreasing encapsulation efficiency) and the burst of released drugs is quite sharp due to the rapid in vitro degradation release process. 204 However, blends of appropriate polymers-such as those including TSP-can increase drug encapsulation. 205 Researchers have shown that diclofenac sodium-loaded pH-sensitive TSP-alginate composite beads are a suitable method of controlled drug delivery, particularly for pharmaceuticals with various enzymes, peptides, and other physiochemical properties. 206 ",

            "text": "The eye is generally impermeable to most environmental agents. The blink reflex assists with a continuous tear flow that clears the ocular surface and inhibits microorganism build-up. With their defensins, lactoferrin, lysozyme, and secretory immunoglobulins, tears also help restrict bacterial growth on the ocular surface. 209, 210 Although most pathogens cannot penetrate a healthy corneal layer, any sort of injury to the ocular surface-caused by anything from allergic hypersensitivity to foreign body trauma-greatly increases the risk of infections like microbial keratitis. 211 To combat keratitis, high drug concentrations must be maintained at the infected site. This would apply to cataract treatment as well. Ingested drugs make little sense since the cornea is not vascularized, so the most common approach today is to treat keratitis with topical drugs. At the same time, continuous tear flow limits the bioavailability of topical drugs and the corneal epithelium resists drug penetration, so treatment typically involves topical drug administration 1-4 times an hour for 2 or 3 days. Such a treatment generally requires hospitalization, is clearly inconvenient for the patient, and is also associated with toxicity to the corneal epithelium in vitro. 212 However, TSP could change this, given its demonstrated ophthalmic applications. 213 TSP is branched, non-ionic, and neutral, made up of a cellulose-like backbone with xylose and galactoxylose constituents. This structure lends the polysaccharide a 'mucin-like' molecular configuration, thereby leading to its mucoadhesive properties. 214 TSP's structural similarity to endogenous mucin might be what enables formulations containing the polymer to successfully adhere to the ocular surface for extended periods of time and provide relief for symptoms of dry eye. 215 Some studies have also indicated that TSP might exceed Hyaluronic acid-a visco-enhancer sometimes incorporated in topical eye care solutions-in terms of ocular retention time, relief of dry eye symptoms, and wound healing abilities. 216 In addition, TSP at particular concentrations is able to crystalize in a fern-like shape, increasing its similarity to natural tears. 217 One ophthalmic application of TSP is as a mucoadhesive polymer that enhances viscosity in order to maximize contact time between antibiotics and the tissue of the cornea. Since TSP is non-toxic to the ocular region, available on the market, a good tear fluid substitute, and an accelerant of the corneal wound healing rate, it is a good option for the ocular administration of antibiotics. Such a use would likely decrease corneal toxicity and increase patient compliance due to its simple and less frequent nature of administration. 218 The use of TSP for ophthalmic drug delivery is particularly appealing given its ability to release both water-soluble and -insoluble drugs in a controlled manner. The rate of drug release can be easily altered by manipulating the degree of crosslinking or using diluents such as lactose and microcrystalline cellulose. 219 TSP as a hydrophilic drug delivery system has been proven as an effective model with the use of several drugs, including gentamicin, ofloxacin, nifedipine, and rufloxacin. 220 This demonstrated success as well as TSP's non-carcinogenicity, high drug-holding capacity, and excellent thermal stability all point towards favorable developments of the polysaccharide for biomaterial use in future ophthalmic applications.",

After receiving a high-fat diet to make them obese, rats that were orally administered Tamarindus indica pulp aqueous extract (TIE) prepared from matured fruits displayed lower levels of food and caloric intake. Therefore, their mean body weight and body weight gain was far less than in the positive control group of obese rats who did not receive any TIE. In addition to decreasing the weight gain caused by a high-fat diet, TIE has also demonstrated the potential to prevent excessive weight gain. 224 Tamarindus indica contains many flavonoid compounds which are considered as inhibitors of fatty acid synthase activity, which could be part of the reason why TIE has displayed such anti-obesity promise. It is also possible that the high acidic and digestible starch contents of tamarind extract alter the colonic mucosa and affect the colon's microfloral content in such a way as to aggravate the adverse effects of a fatty diet and obese condition. 225, 226 Antihelminthic The bark of Tamarindus indica has demonstrated substantial anthelmintic activity, meaning that it is effective at killing or expelling parasitic worms (helminths). 227 This could be due in part to the tannins present in tamarind bark, which are capable of binding free proteins in the gastrointestinal tract of the host animal or glycoproteins on the parasite's cuticle in order to kill the worm. 228, 229 One study demonstrated the efficacy of tamarind bark extracts in expelling two types of test worms, an Indian earthworm (Pheretima posthuma) and an aquarium worm (Tubifex tubifex). The earthworm was anatomically and physiologically similar to intestinal roundworm parasites found in humans, and the aquarium worms belong to the same group of Annelida as these earthworms.",
