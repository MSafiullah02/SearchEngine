While the genomes of DNA viruses and bacteria may serve to directly activate cGAS, damage to the mitochondria during infection with RNA viruses can also trigger cGAS activation through exposure of mitochondrial DNA [11]. Therefore, pathogens from divergent groups encode proteins targeting cGAS, 2\u20323\u2032-cGAMP, and STING to disrupt signaling. Despite the great diversity of these pathogens and the effectors they employ to restrict cGAS\u2013STING activation, shared strategies can be identified which allow escape from the innate immune response (Figure 1\n).",

In particular, formation of higher-order phase-separated droplets has emerged as a checkpoint for regulating cGAS activation [12\u2022], new structures of STING in complex with TBK1 have provided a mechanism for assembly of the STING signalosome and activation of downstream signaling [13\u2022,14\u2022], and extracellular 2\u20323\u2032-cGAMP signaling has emerged as an entirely new facet of cGAS\u2013STING biology [15,16]. While other recent reviews provide in-depth analysis of these new discoveries [17,18], here we focus on conserved strategies utilized by different pathogens for evasion of cGAS\u2013STING immunity. Study of these strategies has provided important insight into cellular regulation of cGAS\u2013STING signaling, and likewise these pathogen immune escape factors will continue to serve as useful tools to gain mechanistic insight into pathway function and regulation. In turn, our deepening understanding of the cGAS\u2013STING pathway creates new questions regarding the mechanisms of different groups of viral and bacterial factors which inhibit signaling and indicates new strategies which may be exploited by pathogens for immune evasion.",

This is accomplished in different ways by both DNA and RNA viruses. For example, the dengue virus (DENV) protease complex NS2B3 cleaves cGAS to prevent its activation by mitochondrial DNA during infection [11]. The related flavivirus Zika virus (ZIKV) utilizes an indirect strategy: its NS1 protein stabilizes caspase-1 leading to cGAS cleavage [21\u2022\u2022]. Another indirect strategy is utilized by DNA viruses in the Poxviridae family, where the vaccinia virus (VACV) F17 protein dysregulates mTOR, leading to enhanced cGAS degradation and impaired cytosolic DNA sensing late in infection [22\u2022\u2022].",

            "text": "In the event that viral DNA is exposed in the cytosol before replication and gene expression, the nuclear-replicating herpesviruses carry immune antagonists directly within the viral particle to disable DNA sensing after infection. Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) VP22 and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) UL83 are both tegument proteins which bind cGAS and block downstream signaling [23,24]. Another member of the Herpesviridae, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), also encodes a tegument protein that inhibits cGAS, ORF52 (also named KicGAS) [25]. ORF52 blocks cGAS activation through a mechanism which requires both cGAS and DNA binding by ORF52. While these proteins from diverse herpesviruses seemingly vary in their requirement for DNA binding activity, they share striking similarities in that each is carried within the virion to bind cGAS and block immune activation after infection. HCMV expresses two additional proteins which interfere with cGAS-DNA binding and formation of higher-order complexes, UL31 and UL42 [26\u2022\u2022, 27]. Likewise, cytoplasmic isoforms of the KSHV LANA protein have been shown to bind cGAS, and block downstream signaling [28]. Given new data demonstrating that cGAS phase separates with DNA [12], it is tempting to speculate that some or all of these proteins interfere individually or collaboratively with multivalent cGAS-DNA binding, thus restricting phase separation and altering the balance of innate immune sensing in favor of viral replication.",

The nature of the cGAS ligand during infection with different pathogens remains unclear \u2014 whether it is always the viral or bacterial genome, or to what extent oxidative stress and exposure of mitochondrial DNA or cellular genomic DNA may play a role in cGAS activation during infection remains a topic of debate. Further, a striking number of viral cGAS antagonists serve as virion structural components, including several herpesvirus tegument proteins, and VACV F17. Given that virion stability and efficiency of viral DNA packaging may influence cytosolic DNA sensing during infection, further work to establish the exact mechanisms by which these proteins antagonize cGAS\u2013STING signaling will provide important insight to help unite our understanding of their structural and immune antagonist roles.",

Poxin is highly specific for host 2\u20323\u2032-cGAMP, and deletion of poxin from the viral genome resulted in attenuation of VACV in a mouse model of infection. Functional poxin enzymes are also found in the genomes of insect viruses in the family Baculoviridae, and moths and butterflies, which serve as hosts to these viruses [33\u2022\u2022]. The emerging role for cGAS\u2013STING signaling in insects is likely to enable discovery of additional insect pathogen inhibitors of pathway activation [40, 41, 42]. In mammals, no cytosolic enzymes have been discovered which degrade 2\u20323\u2032-cGAMP, but instead the extracellular enzyme ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase family member 1 (ENPP1) has been shown to be the major source of 2\u20323\u2032-cGAMP-degrading activity in mammalian tissue and plasma [43]. Interestingly, avian poxviruses lack a homolog of poxin, but do encode a predicted homolog of ENPP1, indicating these viruses may have obtained alternative means of degrading 2\u20323\u2032-cGAMP during infection [44]. Together, these results indicate that 2\u20323\u2032-cGAMP degradation is a more widespread mechanism for control of innate immune signaling than previously understood.",

It remains unclear how these different processes may regulate one another, but interestingly, a number of pathogen factors interfere with one or more steps. Two RNA virus factors, Hepatitis C virus NS4B, and the coronavirus HCoV-NL63 papain-like protease (PL-pro) both interfere with STING oligomerization [55,56]. Interestingly, it is the deubiquitinase activity rather than the protease activity of PL-pro that is required for antagonism of STING oligomer formation [56]. Several other pathogen factors have been discovered which appear to interfere specifically with STING ubiquitination, including the human T-lymphotrophic virus 1 Tax protein [57], and Yersinia YopJ protein, which also functions as a deubiquitinase [58]. YopJ is additionally reported to block STING ER to ERGIC trafficking, perhaps implying a connection between these processes [58]. Several viral proteins directly target STING trafficking to the ERGIC, which requires the iRhom2/TRAP\u03b2 complex [54]. The HCMV tegument protein UL82 disrupts the complex between STING, iRhom2 and TRAP\u03b2 [59]. Similarly, HCMV UL42, along with its role in antagonizing cGAS oligomerization, is reported to stimulate degradation of TRAP\u03b2 in order to block STING trafficking [27]. Last, the bacterium Shigella flexneri encodes IpaJ which inhibits STING trafficking by an indirect mechanism, targeting ARF GTPases to block traffic out of the ER [60].",

The KSHV vIRF1 protein blocks this process, preventing association of TBK1 [62]. Mareck's disease virus is an avian oncogenic herpesvirus, and its oncoprotein Meq functions in a similar way, blocking recruitment of TBK1 to STING in chicken cells [63\u2022\u2022]. Interestingly, the oncoproteins E1A and E7 from adenovirus and human papillomavirus also bind and inhibit STING, however the mechanistic consequences of binding have not yet been elucidated [64]. HSV-1 ICP27 functions differently, associating with the active STING/TBK1 complex, and preventing IRF3 recruitment and phosphorylation to block the downstream type I interferon response [65].",

Further, recent STING structures in complex with TBK1 now provide a framework for structural study of factors like KSHV vIRF1 and HSV-1 ICP27 which act on the STING/TBK1 signalosome to prevent downstream immune activation. The details of how STING recruits other downstream factors aside from TBK1 and IRF3 are still unclear, but recent work shows that the HIV-2 Vpx protein can selectively inhibit STING-mediated NF-\u03baB activation [67\u2022\u2022], providing an opportunity to better understand this process.",

How do pathogen factors recognize and interact with cGAS and STING on a molecular level, and how has pathogen evasion shaped the structure and regulation of this innate immune pathway? Could viral or bacterial cGAS\u2013STING pathway inhibitors make useful therapeutics for treating autoimmune diseases? cGAS was recently identified as part of a large family of bacterial cGAS/DncV-like nucleotidyltransferase (CD-NTase) enzymes, encompassing thousands of homologs which drive immunity to phage through the action of numerous distinct downstream effectors including STING-like proteins. [68, 69\u2022\u2022, 70]. Could bacteriophages share strategies, or perhaps even conserved mechanisms of immune evasion with mammalian viruses? Phage are known to encode anti-CRISPR nucleases to degrade a cyclic oligoadenylate second-messenger for evasion of Type III CRISPR systems [71] raising the question of whether these viruses might also encode enzymes functionally similar to poxin for evasion of CD-NTase signaling. Intervention by pathogens has often provided important new insight into basic biological processes, and future studies of cGAS\u2013STING signaling must continue to harness the power of viruses and bacteria to generate answers to these questions.",
