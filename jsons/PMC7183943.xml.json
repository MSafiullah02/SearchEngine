            "text": "The landscapes of urban settlements comprise a large diversity of human-dominated areas that are shaped simultaneously by the interactions of cultural and natural factors (Tan et al., 2018, 22). They are characterized by a high level of heterogeneity of spatial forms and extent, culture, and economic activities, and embed to varying degrees, natural and semi-natural spaces such as woodlands, wetlands, parks and other green spaces amidst the built environment. As the predominant habitat for the majority of the world\u2019s population, they deservedly receive significant attention in their planning, design and management (Ahern, 2013, Andersson, 2006, Borgstr\u00f6m et al., 2006). In this context, a concept that has been increasingly used to guide the planning and design of urban landscapes is \u201curban ecosystem services\u201d (UES). Recent reviews on UES (e.g., see Haase et al., 2014, Luederitz et al., 2015) underscore its use in diverse disciplines, connected by an overarching goal of shaping urban landscapes to be more sustainable and liveable.",

            "text": "UES is appealing as a concept to promote urban sustainability for several reasons. First, there is a direct analogy to the established and popular concept of \u201cecosystem services\u201d. Ecosystem services highlight human dependence on natural ecosystems for our well-being. Similarly, UES reinforces the idea that ecosystems services can be locally produced in urban areas to support human well-being in tangible and intangible ways. Second, urbanization worldwide leads to a general dissociation of urban dwellers from nature (Turner, Nakamura, & Dinetti, 2004). Such an \u201cextinction of experience\u201d of nature may have adverse consequences on the attitudes and behavior of urban dwellers toward environment stewardship and urban sustainability (Ives et al., 2017, Soga and Gaston, 2016). Natural ecosystems in cities provide opportunities for urban dwellers to experience nature and engage in stewardship of the environment (Andersson et al., 2014), and UES serves as a conceptual tool to reinforce this goal. Third, in extending the use of UES as a conceptual tool for environmental stewardship, UES also acts as a social tool to bring together diverse stakeholders to foster community-driven (Luederitz et al., 2015) and government-led planning (Rall, Kabisch, & Hansen, 2015) for urban sustainability",

            "text": "Despite its increasing usage, what constitutes an UES is still ambiguous. The first reason for this is inconsistencies in how the term \u201cservice\u201d is interpreted, and particularly in how this term relates to the concepts of \u201cprocesses\u201d, \u201cfunctions\u201d and \u201cbenefits\u201d. Multiple definitions exist, and various scholars have discussed the differences among them and the need to use the term more consistently (see Fisher et al., 2009, La Notte et al., 2017, Nahlik et al., 2012), which we do not repeat here. In this paper, we focus on the second reason, which arises from the dual meanings of \u201curban ecosystem\u201d. This term is commonly used to refer to natural, semi-natural, or managed communities of organisms and habitats that lie within urban boundaries. These include remnant, relatively undisturbed vegetated areas (e.g., such as forest patches and riparian corridors), as well as highly managed urban green spaces such as parks, and gardens. Increasingly, this definition is also extended to include greenery on buildings and infrastructure such as green roofs and green walls. The second, more expansive use of \u201curban ecosystem\u201d refers to the entire city as a human-dominated ecosystem. This latter usage can be traced back to the 1960s, when ecologists began to conceive of cities as ecosystems, and adopt a \u201csystem perspective\u201d to understand them (Alberti, 2007, 9). The definition of a city as an ecosystem is now prevalent in the urban ecology and urban system science literature (for example, see Alberti, 2007, Decker et al., 2000, Grimm et al., 2008, Pickett and Grove, 2009). It follows from the two meanings of urban ecosystem that there are two possible literal interpretations of UES: \u201curban ecosystem services\u201d, referring to the ecosystem services which are produced from natural or semi-natural spaces within urban boundaries, and \u201curban ecosystem services\u201d which are the services in, of, or pertaining to cities as urban ecosystems. The first interpretation is in most common use in the UES literature, and deals with the natural and semi-natural spaces within cities (Luederitz et al., 2015). The second interpretation could be considered to cover not just ecosystem services from natural ecosystems as applied in the former definition, but also the wide range of services produced by humans, including housing, transport, education, entertainment, or medical care\u2014in fact to any service relating to urban areas that is needed by urban dwellers. We refer to this latter group of services as \u201curban services\u201d, following Antognelli and Vizzari, 2016, Belanche et al., 2016. Specifically, Antognelli and Vizzari (2016) used urban services to refer to \u201cbasic provisions such as sanitary sewer systems, domestic water systems, fire and police protection services, public transit services, road construction services, lighting systems, recreational facilities, schools\u201d. \u201cUrban ecosystem service\u201d thus reflects a broad perspective, including services from natural ecosystems and urban services, and which may be deemed as UES sensu lato. \u201cUrban ecosystem services\u201d more narrowly refers to services generated from natural ecosystems and is UES sensu stricto. For clarity, we henceforth use \u201cecosystem services in urban areas\u201d to denote urban ecosystem services, and \u201cservices of urban ecosystems\u201d to denote urban ecosystem services in this article. Table 1\nhighlights the key differences between these two interpretations of UES.",

            "text": "We can trace the conceptual ambiguity in the two interpretations of UES to two influential papers on UES. In the first, Bolund and Hunhammer wrote: \u201cIn the case of the urban environment, it is both possible to define the city as one ecosystem or to see the city as composed of several individual ecosystems \u2026\u201d, but for simplicity, they chose to define the term urban ecosystems as all \u201cnatural green and blue areas in the city\u201d (Bolund and Hunhammer, 1999, 24). One might infer from this that these individual ecosystems are implied to be smaller ecosystems nested within the city as a larger ecosystem, and accordingly, the ecosystem services produced within smaller ecosystems are a subset of those from the city as an ecosystem. However, exactly which services might be included in the latter category was not elaborated (Bolund and Hunhammer, 1999). In the second influential report on the topic, the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment highlighted that there are several perspectives that might be taken in the interpretation of UES in posing this question: \u201cecosystems in urban systems, urban systems as ecosystems, or ecosystems and urban systems?\u201d (MEA, 2005, 799). The first term is akin to the concept of \u201cecology in city\u201d, the second to \u201cecology of city\u201d, paradigms which originated from the pioneering work of Grimm et al., 2000, Pickett et al., 2001 on cities as urban ecological systems. The third option in MEA\u2019s question presumably implies a separation between natural ecosystems and the built components of cities. The MEA took the position that it does not \u201ctreat all urban services as ecosystem services\u201d, as ecosystems are \u201cunderstood to be biophysical systems\u201d and thus ecosystem services from urban systems are \u201cassumed to be distinct from the value internally added through the application of human labor [and other capital]\u201d (ibid). Bolund and Hunhammer (1999) and MEA (2005) were thus specific in defining which ecosystems produce \u201cecosystem services\u201d. While they have adopted the narrower interpretation of UES, however, the two contrasting notions of UES described above are equally valid and equally supported by their own literatures and research communities. Much less has been written about the broader concept of UES, i.e. services of urban ecosystems, and the value of this concept has not been discussed in detail.",

Definitions of terms, therefore, have importance beyond semantics. Golubiewski (2012) suggests that \u201cusing inappropriate rhetoric misdirects researchers, which influences scientific investigation\u2014from problem statements to interpretations\u201d. Thus, the specific ways in which commonly used but ambiguous terms with broad meanings, such as \u201cecosystem services\u201d, \u201csustainability\u201d and \u201cresilience\u201d are used as metaphors are thus important, as how they frame the environment can promote or restrict discourse on environmental management and influence the political significance of the subject matter. For instance, Coffey (2016) argued that the dominant use of ecosystem services as an economic metaphor risks creating a narrow, anthropocentric perspective of the environment, as it places excessive emphasis upon the provision of goods and services of value to humans. As also highlighted by Polasky, Tallis, and Reyers (2015), a lack of common understanding and definition in ecosystem services research is also a barrier to translating research outcomes to action for practitioners and policy makers. To encourage accurate applications, it is necessary to unpack multiple meanings of terms. For instance, Mace, Norris, and Fitter (2012) illustrated the value of doing this for the term \u201cbiodiversity\u201d, a commonly used term that is beset with unclear, overlapping applications.",

In this perspective paper, we introduce a definition of UES as \u201caspects of ecosystems that are generated from natural capital in combination with human-derived capital, and that contribute, directly or indirectly, to human well-being in urban areas\u201d, which we believe adequately captures both interpretations of UES.

Specifically, we focus on three areas: (1) What are the trends in use of UES in the published literature? (2) What do UES refer to in the literature? (3) How might a broader framing of UES be used to advance our understanding of the provision of UES provision in cities? In the following sections, we describe a literature review conducted to understand the definitions and use of the UES adopted in peer-reviewed studies. Through a conceptual framework in which we link UES to natural and human-derived capital, we explain the foundations for proposing that urban services are bona fide urban ecosystem services and describe three normative propositions on how the framework can be used to guide provision of UES through a better understanding of its potential and limitations. We conclude with recommendations on further work that is needed to address key questions that may arise from the application of our framework.",

A significant minority also considered the ecosystem services provided by community gardens, allotment gardens, domestic gardens and rooftop gardens within urban areas. In more recent years, with the advent of green roofs and green walls, there are also several papers that examine the ecosystem services provided by these novel ecosystems. This diversity underscores the fact that the term ecosystem is not restricted to any specific spatial scale, and so there can be multiple urban ecosystems within any geographical location, depending on which boundary is used to define the ecosystem of interest, e.g. administrative boundary, watershed, a remnant woodland, etc. Which scale is most appropriate depends, therefore, on the study context, the research question posed, and the urban challenges to be addressed. Accordingly, different types of UES are produced depending on which scale is applied to an urban ecosystem.",

However, the overwhelming majority of UES publications takes the first perspective, treating urban ecosystems to be natural and semi-natural areas within or adjacent to urban areas. Only a few papers assessed UES from the abiotic components of cities. For instance, Kroll, M\u00fcller, Haase, and Fohrer (2012) assessed the potential of the abiotic components of the environment to provide renewable energy from wind, water and solar radiation, as well as non-renewable materials such as lignite, as types of provisioning ecosystem services to support energy demand of an urban settlement. Yang et al. (2015) assessed the stock of industrial land as a source of ecosystem service in the manufacture of goods in urban agglomerations in China. Morel et al., (2014) argued that the soil, even in urban or built-up sites, is a neglected abiotic resource that is capable of providing a wide range of ecosystem services, and called for better consideration of soils in urban planning and management. Tiwary and Kumar (2014) also highlighted the need to consider not just green infrastructure, but also its interaction with grey infrastructure for assessment of UES. These examples are the exceptions, however, in a literature that is focused predominantly upon more natural habitats in cities. This emphasis reflects the lasting influence of the earliest publications on UES, in which urban ecosystems was used to denote constructed wetlands, riparian corridors, urban parks (Cairns & Palmer, 1995), urban forests (Freedman, Love, & O'Neil, 1996), and \u201call natural green and blue areas in the city, including \u2026 street trees and ponds\u201d (Bolund & Hunhammar, 1999). This influence may also be seen in recent reviews on UES (Table 2\n), all of which defined or implied UES as provided by urban analogs of natural ecosystems.",

Importantly, we find little theoretical basis or conceptual underpinnings to support such a broadly-based application of UES. Like ecosystem services, which has been described as a catch-all phrase that refers to anything in an urban landscape that is beneficial to humans (Nahlik et al., 2012), UES is similarly used in a loose way to convey their importance in urban areas. It appears that UES has been conceived by directly transplanting the ecosystem services concept to urban areas, but unlike the latter which has been, and continues to be strengthened by numerous conceptual approaches, the conceptual framing of UES remains weak. We contribute to strengthening this aspect using a conceptual framework linking UES to the concept of natural and human-derived capital.",

Constanza describes this clearly in saying that ecosystem services \u201crefer to the relative contribution of natural capital to the production of various human benefits, in combination with the three other forms of capital\u201d (Constanza, 2012, 27). He highlights that in order for ecosystem services from natural capital to be fully realized, natural capital has to be combined with other forms of capital. This is particularly true for UES. For instance, an urban park cannot exist without financial capital and input of human capital, at all stages from design to construction to maintenance; green roofs and green walls use substantial amounts of construction materials, like drainage cells, geotextile and supporting structures made of steel, concrete, plastics, etc.; coastal defenses can only be constructed with human and built capital, even when they rely heavily on natural ecosystems such as wetlands. UES could thus be conceived as being produced through a combination of natural and human-derived capital, with some requiring more of the former and less of the latter, and vice-versa. Such a combination could be represented by a gradient, as shown in Fig. 3.",

The most widely used definition refers to the biotic and abiotic components of natural ecosystems from which ecosystem services are produced for human well-being (Gray, 2018, Guerry et al., 2015, Smith et al., 2017). As an economic metaphor, the capacity of natural capital to generate ecosystem services also invokes the use of \u201cstocks and flows\u201d, in which stocks refers to amounts of natural capital, flows refers to transformation or movement of the stocks, and ecosystem services are derived from both the stocks and flows of natural capital (Jones et al., 2016). The biotic component comprises all living organisms and can be considered at different hierarchical levels from the individual, community and population; the abiotic component comprises non-living resources such as minerals, earth materials (e.g. sand, silt, sediments), fossil fuel, etc. Within an ecosystem, there are also abiotic processes, which refer to flows of energy and materials driven by energy systems from the sun, moon (tidal), geology (e.g. geo-thermal) and hydrological systems occurring within the atmospheric terrestrial and aquatic components of the biosphere. Abiotic processes can exist independently of biotic structures, because they are part of large-scale processes on Earth, but it should be highlighted that within a natural ecosystem, flows of energy and materials are highly regulated by the biotic component and therefore, they are biophysical and biogeochemical in nature. Nevertheless, despite it being a fundamental component of natural ecosystems, the abiotic component has generally been neglected in ecosystem services studies (Gray, 2018; van der Meulen, 2016).",

This is because all forms of built capital, such as infrastructure and buildings, originate from natural capital, which is therefore the ultimate source of human well-being. Built infrastructure relies on extraction of abiotic resources such as minerals and earth materials, and is constructed or processed using energy, whether renewable or non-renewable, from abiotic processes of natural capital. For example, buildings are created from abiotic components such as sand, cement, timber, steel, polymers, and glass, and the heating and cooling needs of buildings are met by abiotic components and processes for energy generation. Similarly, telecommunication infrastructure has long depended on abiotic components. From cross-continental telegraphy\u2019s dependence on gutta percha and Indian rubber for insulating submarine cables in the mid-1800s to 1930s (Headrick, 1987), to the current internet era using fibre-optic submarine cables insulated with petroleum-based polymers, this essential service cannot be achieved without biotic and abiotic resources drawn from nature.",

At this level, the framework represents a view of urban ecosystems as socio-ecological-technological systems, but is silent on how it can be used to advance societal goals with regards to how cities should be developed, such as for urban sustainability, a goal which is fundamentally normative in nature (Parnell, 2016). For instance, as cities expand their boundaries in response to growing populations, tradeoffs in land use are inevitable, such as between clearing its forests (natural capital), and creating land for housing and industries (built capital) with the aim of creating wealth for its citizens (human capital). Reduction of natural capital is not without adverse consequences, as loss of forested land can alter a city\u2019s hydrology and climate, leading to adverse consequences such as flash floods and the urban heat island effect. How should cities manage such tradeoffs? Similarly, should a city reclaim land from coastal or inland waters, that destroy aquatic habitats, remove protective coastal ecosystems against storms, and destroy livelihood of communities dependent on aquatic resources, but in the process create manufactured capital and financial capital for the city that are essential for economic progress?

She went on to recommend the use of biophysical and biogeochemical processes that pervade urban areas to guide urban design. We repeat her call here to take advantage of all components of natural capital in urban planning and design. For example, many cities have directed their attention to the use of vegetated areas to mitigate high urban temperatures, but a more comprehensive approach would include abiotic processes such as creating ventilation channels using urban morphology to direct wind flow, and abiotic components such as water bodies, shade cast by buildings, and building materials with high albedo that are able to better reflect solar radiation to combat urban warming. Similarly, instead of just focusing on the capacity of urban vegetation to mitigate air pollution, this critical urban challenge might be better tackled through the use of fuels that produce less emissions (abiotic component), wind channels that disperse pollutants (abiotic process), and physical barriers that separate humans from emission sources (abiotic component). The key emphasis is that urban challenges are best addressed holistically across disciplines and using approaches that combine biotic and abiotic components and processes, rather than focusing on any specific component alone.",

There is a general misunderstanding of the extent and importance of the contributions of ecosystem services in urban areas (Pataki et al., 2011) which needs to be corrected. For instance, tree planting is often promoted by advocacy groups on the basis that urban trees combat climate change through C sequestration (see Kanniah et al., 2014, Papa and Cooper, 2019). However, it was already pointed in the an urban forest study in the US in 1993 (Nowak & McPherson, 1993) that planting 100 million trees will optimistically, only offset the carbon emission in the US by less than 1 percent over a 50-year period. More recent studies now also dispel the notion that carbon sequestration from urban vegetation can make significant offset to cities\u2019 carbon emission (Chen, 2015, Tang et al., 2016). Even if a whole city were cloaked in greenery, this would contribute only marginally to mitigating the local emission of greenhouse gases or changing atmospheric CO2 concentration. New evidence now also shows that the role of urban vegetation to improve air quality may have also been over-estimated (Eisenman et al., 2019, Viippola et al., 2018, Whitlow et al., 2014). The limits of natural ecosystems in cities to in addressing key urban challenges is also imposed by the physical limitation of natural or semi-natures space in cities\u2014 cities are dominated by the built component (Tan and Abdul Hamid, 2014). Densifying cities usually face challenges in providing such spaces (Haaland and van den Bosch, 2015, Edwards, 2020). Thus, generation of UES to satisfy human needs cannot be dependent on the natural component alone.",

Such a plurality in concepts could arise from differences in disciplinary origins of the terms, absence of shared perspectives among disciplines, and limitations in existing concepts to accommodate new perspectives that are continually developed by scholars. While it is necessary to delineate the relationships between these concepts, it would be counterproductive to define them too narrowly and so lose the flexibility of applying them under different contexts (Pauleit et al., 2018). This is especially when planners are confronted with a multitude of concepts that need to be operationalized in land use planning. Mapping the interrelationships between concepts is a useful approach. For instance, Pauleit et al. (ibid) provided a useful mapping of the relationships between nature-based solution, ecosystem-based adaption, green infrastructure and ecosystem services across the dimension of scope and existing state of operationalization of the concept in practice. Nessh\u00f6ver et al. (2017) also compared nature-based solution with six different related concepts to evaluate overlapping meanings and clarify differences.",

For instance, how does green infrastructure, which as we note in Fig. 1 is the next most published concept after UES, fit in the conceptual framework (Fig. 3). Notwithstanding that its meanings and usage have evolved with time, the most common definitions of green infrastructure refer to the spatial and physical network of green and blue spaces within and around urban areas (Ahern, Cilliers, & Niemel\u00e4, 2014; Albert et al., 2017, Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions Green Infrastructure (GI) - Enhancing Europe's Natural Capital/* COM/2013/0249 Final */, 2013; Hansen and Pauleit, 2014, Tzoulas et al., 2007). We suggest that a broad interpretation of the term \u201cgreen infrastructure\u201d would include all those abiotic and biotic components of natural capital that are incorporated through urban planning and management into cities and their regions. However, when planning or regulatory agencies begin to describe green infrastructure as an approach to land use planning rather than as a physical network (see US EPA, n.d.), the concept to green infrastructure could conceivably refer to the process of planning and provision of \u201cecosystem services in urban areas\u201d within the framework.",

Ecology in city focuses on the analogs of natural ecosystems in cities, and we suggest that this broadly encompasses studies focused on understanding ecosystem services from natural capital in cities, i.e., \u201cecosystem services in urban areas\u201d. Ecology of city takes a holistic view of cities as comprising not just the natural component, but also social, and built (or technological) components, and seeks to understand how complex interactions between these components define the characteristics of cities as complex systems. Ecology for city assumes a normative view combined with an action-oriented approach that studies ecology in and ecology of city should be used to advance societal goals of urban sustainability. Thus, \u201cservices of urban ecosystems\u201d manifest the outcomes of studies in ecology in and ecology of city in proposing that both the natural and human-derived capital must always be considered in concert to deliver all the services required for human well-being. Ecology for city is the application of our framework guided by socially determined normative propositions. It thus seems possible to delineate the relationships between UES and these related concepts using our conceptual framework. As the literature on these areas is extensive, characterizing the interrelationships will require a substantial review that cannot be accomplished in this paper. Our intention here is to highlight another potential use of our framework and encourage more in-depth assessment to clarify and expound the interrelationships more clearly.",

Such a broad framework thus needs to be accompanied by normative propositions. The three propositions we described are not exhaustive and further suggestions on these will need to be developed. In fact, we also feel that more will emerge as socially formed norms of human-nature relationships evolve over time, under the influence of social, economic, and cultural context of different societies. Such norms will have particular relevance to cultural ecosystem services, which are generally non-material in nature, but always context dependent as culture and landscapes have reciprocal relationships (Nassauer, 1995).

In this perspective article, we focus on the dual meanings of \u201curban ecosystem\u201d and its implications for our notions of \u201curban ecosystem services\u201d\u2014a narrow notion of ecosystem services from natural ecosystems in urban areas, and a broad notion of urban ecosystem services comprising the former group as well as all urban services that are prevalent in cities. Although these dual interpretations were mentioned in two early seminal papers on ecosystem services, there have been no clear proposals on how to apply them clearly. Recently, Grimm et al. (2015) suggested that these two meanings lead to an \u201cecosystem conundrum\u201d and called for a broader framing of ecosystem services in cities.

Such a broad definition of UES is potentially problematic if it is used to lend support to the continual exploitation of natural capital for human well-being and lead to worsening environmental conditions. Its use, therefore, has to be supported by normative positions developed collectively in human societies. We described three normative propositions on how the framework can be used.

This is with the aim of facilitating their applications more precisely and fostering greater clarity of their use in future studies. We also suggested areas for testing in research and applied studies that could cut across disciplines.",
