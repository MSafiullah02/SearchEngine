Our autopsy study demonstrates the range of abnormalities present and the specific kidney cells likely infected with the virus, and thus may provide important information for future clinicopathologic studies in less severely ill patients with COVID-19 infection and kidney injury. We observed significant ATI, the occlusion of microvascular lumens mainly by erythrocytes with ensuing endothelial damage, as well as glomerular and vascular changes indicative of underlying diabetic or hypertensive disease. Some of these findings are in accordance with former mechanisms known for \u03b2-coronavirus infection in kidney. We also show findings that suggest distinct mechanisms of this novel coronavirus infection, involving direct kidney parenchyma infection and likely secondary endothelial injury.

In addition, ACE2, discovered in 2000, negatively regulates the classic ACE\u2013angiotensin \u2161 type 1 receptor axis.9 In the kidneys, ACE2 is expressed in the apical brush borders of the proximal tubules as well as the podocytes in less intensity. In endothelial cells of the kidney, only ACE is expressed without detectable ACE2.10\n,\n11 In line with this distribution of ACE2, we observed virus particles in tubular epithelium and podocytes, sites of known ACE2 expression. Collectively, the tubular and glomerular visceral epithelial cells of the kidney are the main targets of SARS-CoV-2. Based on our observations, the endothelium thus is not expected to be directly infected with SARS-CoV-2. However, we cannot totally rule out the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 can infect other resident kidney cells, as ACE2 expression may be altered in disease states or due to medications. Indeed, we show intensely positive parietal epithelial cells and occasional podocyte staining with ACE2 in 3 of the 5 COVID-19 kidney samples we assessed.",

In the kidney, CD147 is highly expressed on the cell surface of proximal tubular epithelium and infiltrating inflammatory cells. Interestingly, the CD147 partners, cyclophilins, play an important role in the replication process of coronavirus, and cyclophilins' inhibitor, cyclosporine, can effectively suppress the intracellular propagation of virus.13\n,\n14 Presumably, interrupting the CD147-cyclophilins axis may be a promising strategy to treat COVID-19.",
