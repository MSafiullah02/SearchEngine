About 350\u2013500 million clinical episodes of malaria occur each year, and the disease is responsible for more than 1 million deaths annually (WHO, 2008). The range of areas inhabited by malaria-carrying mosquitoes is expanding due to global climate change (Patz and Olson, 2006). Thus, there is a chance of recovery of malaria, not only as an outcome of the increasing number of imported cases, but also as an effect of the rise of habitats apt for malaria-carrying mosquitoes. Therefore, the hasty diagnosis of this disease is extremely important.",

However, it is well documented that microscopy has limitations: it is time-consuming, and misdiagnosis of the infecting species is common if the microscopist lacks experience and/or when the parasitemia is low (Kain et al., 1998, Milne et al., 1994, Singh et al., 1999, Snounou et al., 1993a). More recently, serological diagnostic methods and new rapid diagnostic tests have become available, which are most commonly based on the detection of parasite antigens such as histidine-rich protein (HRP)-2 and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in an easy-to-use dipstick or a lateral flow format (Beadle et al., 1994, Makler et al., 1998). The advantages offered by these methods, such as a result can obtain within half an hour by unskilled technicians, are tempered by a few limitations (Moody, 2002). RDT methods do not offer improved sensitivity over microscopy, the sensitivity decreases as parasitemias fall below 100 parasites/\u03bcL (Mills et al., 1999). False positive results are observed, particularly after treatment, as the parasite antigens detected can remain in the circulation following parasite clearance. Moreover, the majority of the commercial RDTs detect HRP-2, which is only expressed by P. falciparum; however, not by other species and therefore this test offers specific diagnosis of falciparum malaria. Most of the non-HRP-2 based tests (LDH and aldolase) are usually pan-species test that allows for the speciation of P. falciparum and/or non-falciparum species when used in combination with HRP-2 based tests.",

            "text": "Several PCR based assays have also been developed for the detection and identification of malaria parasites. Most often based on genus- or species-specific sequences of the parasites rRNA gene (Singh et al., 1999, Kawamoto et al., 1996, Snounou et al., 1993b). PCR-based assays have various advantages over microscopy and RDTs: they are highly specific and sensitive (Kain et al., 1998, Snounou et al., 1993b, Zhong and Kain, 1999), and as few as five parasites per microliter of blood can be detected (Makler et al., 1998). Regrettably, the current PCR-based methods are beyond the capacity of most malaria-endemic countries as they need expensive inspections, sophisticated laboratory and training that make these techniques expensive and practically challenging to implement in the field or resource limited settings. The recently developed loop-mediated isothermal amplification method is a relatively simple and field-adaptable technique (Notomi et al., 2000). This method does not require a thermocycler or sophisticated training. It has the potential to be used as a molecular diagnostic tool for point-of-care (POC) testing in both developing and developed countries. LAMP has been used for the detection of several infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (Hong et al., 2004), West Nile virus (Parida et al., 2004), avian influenza virus (Imai et al., 2006), norovirus (Fukuda et al., 2006) and Legionella bacteria (Annaka et al., 2003).",

However, LAMP assays can be used in the resource limited areas, but there is a need for electricity to power equipment such as thermocycler, water bath, centrifuge etc., second, they require a complex procedure for the sample preparation. Although highly specific and sensitive, the time and resources needed are restricting it from being used in tribal areas. Therefore, there is a requirement for a minimal DNA preparation and field-usable instrument that can allow a faster and objective readout for the diagnosis of malaria in resource-limited settings. Here, we report a simple DNA extraction procedure and the use of a mini portable device in which both amplification and real-time detection units are combined into a single unit for LAMP assay. We regard this method as LAMP-Tube scanner.",

For the LAMP-Tube scanner (LAMP performed using a tube scanner, QIAGEN Lake Constance GmbH, Germany), a second simple and cheap method of DNA extraction was used and described in this work (Fig. 5\n). Briefly, 50 \u03bcL of human blood was directly blotted onto Whatman filter paper disks and air-dried at room temperature for 5 min. Blotted disks were heated in 200 \u03bcL of TE buffer (pH 8.0) at 65 \u00b0C for 15 min followed by crushing the disks and filtered through 5 \u03bcm syringe filter. The filtrate was heated at 60 \u00b0C for 2 min before proceeding to LAMP. Two microliters of the resulting filtrate was used as a template for the LAMP assay and the remaining sample was stored at \u221220 \u00b0C until further analysis. To test the limits of detection of the LAMP-Tube scanner, DNA from the samples was diluted from 1000 p/\u03bcL to 1 p/\u03bcL. Sixty samples confirmed to be P. falciparum positive by microscopy and 30 samples known to be negative for P. falciparum were used to assess the sensitivity and specificity of the LAMP-Tube scanner. Non-malaria infected human DNA was used as a control.",

The costs for the assay are even lower than the presently available RDTs (Poon et al., 2006). LAMP has several advantages over current methods for the molecular diagnosis of disease. The Bst polymerase catalyzing the LAMP reaction is more robust to inhibition than Taq polymerase. It is, therefore, possible to use a modest, rapid and inexpensive regime for sample preparation, unlike those required for standard PCR. Furthermore, the isothermal nature of the LAMP reaction eliminates the need for expensive thermal cyclers. However, the equipment and power requirements for the DNA extraction and LAMP reaction still be a major consideration for many diagnostic facilities. This is an obvious drawback for resource-poor locations, where malaria is endemic. Some studies have clearly demonstrated that LAMP can be used for malaria diagnosis (Poon et al., 2006, Han et al., 2007, Paris et al., 2007, Yamamura et al., 2009, Zheng et al., 2002). In this study, we have developed a simpler method (LAMP-Tube scanner) for the diagnosis of clinical malaria, including species identification, based on the LAMP. We integrated the amplification and detection phases of LAMP into one portable and simple-to-use platform in an attempt to permit this method to be easily usable in field settings.",

The reported sensitivity and specificities by these studies ranged from 73.1% to 98.3% and 85.7% to 100%, respectively, using microscopy as a reference standard. The use of various reference tests, and differences in the parasite densities of the samples used in the various studies, undoubtedly influence the sensitivities and specificities which could explain the differences observed across these studies. Out of the 155 (P. falciparum) & 54 (P. vivax) microscopically positive samples used in this study, 6 and 4 were negative by LAMP-Thermocycler and 7 and 3 by LAMP-Tube scanner. Failing to amplify these samples by the two LAMP methods was not due to low parasite density since the level of parasitemia was within the level detectable by LAMP, but most probably due to a poor quality of the DNA preparation. However, more (28) RDTs false-negative results might be due to the insufficient parasite density and/or material used to manufacture RDT strips. Additional prospective studies in different transmission settings will be needed to further evaluate the performance of the LAMP-Tube scanner method.",

Though the LAMP method can be used for the diagnosis of all four human-infecting malaria parasites (Han et al., 2007), attempts were made only for these two parasites due to clinical sample availability. However, this genus- and species-specific LAMP-Tube scanner method could be used for the detection of all human malaria parasites. It can also be used as a confirmatory test for malaria infection in place of a standard PCR-based assay. The observation that the lowest level of parasitemia required to detect P. falciparum was higher than that needed for the P. vivax tested may be due to variations in the DNA content at different stages of the parasite. These limits of detection of species-specific LAMP-Tube scanner method are similar to those reported for microscopy, RDTs and LAMP-Thermocycler.",

We observed that the time to amplification was shorter for samples with high parasite densities than with low parasite densities. A strict correlation was not observed when samples were compared between runs indicating that one cannot draw conclusions about parasitemia levels based on the amplification time. However, we quantified Lambda phage DNA using the LAMP-tube scanner, although it is not a perfect assay for quantification. We applied the average threshold time for the linear regression analysis. A very good statistically significant linear correlation was seen between all DNA concentrations except the least concentration. Possible explanations are that the longer incubation time before the detectable amplification caused by the lower template DNA concentration reduces the enzyme activity and decreases the annealing efficiency of the primers, may cause a delay in the threshold time. Further improvement is needed to determine that this method can be used for the quantification of malaria parasite.",

This novel method yielded DNA extract that reliably detects as low as 10 p/\u03bcL and showed slightly lower efficiency compared to the Qiagen method. It is not clear whether this difference was due to poor efficiency in DNA extraction at low parasitemia level or due to other factors. The simple heat-treated method yielded DNA extract that could be used to detect as low as 40 p/\u03bcL, has already been described (Poon et al., 2006, Lucchi et al., 2010).

The cost of running the LAMP-Tube scanner method was cheaper than that of the LAMP-Thermocycler when an in-house buffer was used in place of the commercially available buffer. The performance of our in-house buffer was as good as commercial buffer, and it yielded consistently similar results. There are various significant features of the LAMP-Tube scanner that allow it to be an attractive method for field use. This includes, the fact that the tube scanner is easily carriable to remote places while thermocyclers need an established laboratory setting, battery can be used to run the tube scanner, no post-run analyses such as gel electrophoresis is required to visualize the results and finally, the LAMP-Tube scanner method is practically easier to perform than the LAMP-Thermocycler and nested PCR. The tube scanner is equivalent to the real-time turbidimeter used in some studies (Poon et al., 2006) in the sense that both are able to detect a positive sample in real-time resulting in same amplification plots. The turbidimeter measures the turbidity of the reaction mixture while the LAMP-Tube scanner measures the fluorescence units generated as the product is formed. However, the tube scanner has an added feature in which the results (+/\u2212) can be reported on the provided LCD without the need of a computer.",

The LAMP-Tube scanner method will be more attractive for field use if a lyophilized reagent format is achieved. Lyophilized buffer format which is under development, together with this simple DNA extraction and portable battery-powered instrument, offers a tangible route for the detection of malaria in limited resource settings.
