            "text": "Acute lung injury (ALI) \u2014and its most severe form, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)\u2014is a common cause of death in the intensive care unit (ICU). There is currently no specific test to identify the onset of ARDS, and the diagnosis is based on physical examination, oxygen levels in the blood, and chest X-ray or computerized tomography scan (CT-scan) (5, 6). ARDS is characterized by rapid onset of widespread inflammation and recruitment of polymorphonuclear cells, especially neutrophils, leading to loss of endothelial and epithelial barrier functions, with increased leakage and movement of protein into the respiratory tract lining fluid (RTLF) and alveoli leading to pulmonary edema and decreased lung compliance (5, 10, 11). Despite intensive treatment, the mortality rates are ~30\u201340% (5). To reduce invasive diagnostics (e.g., bronchoalveolar lavage and biopsies) and time-consuming in-hospital transport for imaging diagnostics (e.g., CT-scan), we hypothesized that changes in particle flow rate (PFR) pattern from the airways could be an early indicator of acute lung injury used for earlier diagnosis and optimization of personalized therapies.",

EBPs are transmitted in exhaled air during the opening and closing of small airways and measured as PFR but could also be generated by shear forces produced by air flow acting on the RTLF (1). We used a customized particles in exhaled air (PExA) device, which is an optical particle counter that can detect, measure, and quantify EBPs in real time during mechanical ventilation, as we have shown previously in large animal studies and clinically in the ICU following lung transplantation (3, 4). We aimed to determine PFR alterations in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced porcine model of ARDS and whether we could detect changes in the PFR before any changes in conventional parameters indicating ARDS occurred, such as a decrease in blood gases and alterations in ventilator parameters. Monitoring and evaluating the status of the lungs by analyzing PFR may provide real-time insight into pulmonary parenchyma and vessel damage before changes in conventional parameters can be detected.",

The identification of an early biomarker or clinical parameter specific for ARDS would thus facilitate the detection of patients at risk and help to optimize or personalize their therapy. Furthermore, this could also reduce the need for invasive diagnostics and time-consuming in-hospital transports for imaging diagnostics. In the present study, we used an LPS model of acute lung injury in 65-kg pigs to mimic a clinical situation with adult humans. Clinically, ARDS develops over one to several days, but this is challenging to mimic in large animal models. We reduced the time for ARDS development in our model by applying LPS both endotracheally and intravascularly. All animals that received LPS developed ARDS according to the Berlin definition (6). Acute lung injury was further confirmed with histological assessment, which showed severe changes in the lung parenchyma and airways with immune cell infiltration, intra-alveolar hemorrhage, septal thickening, and airway constriction. The animals also showed general septic changes in hemodynamics and blood gas parameters, with a drop in blood pressure, pH, and PaO2 and, at the same time, an increase in cardiac output, lactate, and PaCO2 after LPS administration. Furthermore, these animals developed ARDS in ~90 min. Before a mild ARDS stage was reached, a significant increase in PFR from the lung was seen in all animals. This suggests that the PFR could be used as an early indicator for lung injury before any significant changes in traditional parameters, such as blood gases and mechanical ventilator settings, occur. In the majority (but not all of) the animals who received LPS, we noticed a significant increase in PVR and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.",

            "text": "The pathology of ARDS involves inflammation leading to loss of endothelial and epithelial barrier functions, with increased leakage and movement of protein and fluid into the RTLF (10, 11). The RTLF consists of macromolecules covering the epithelial wall of the airways, including phospholipids and proteins (1). The RTLF also contains glycoproteins and mucins predominantly from the conducting airways (8). Damage to the capillary endothelium and alveolar epithelium in correlation with impaired fluid removal from the alveolar space results in accumulation of protein-rich fluid inside the alveoli. This thereby produces diffuse alveolar damage, with release of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IL-1, and IL-6, which are hallmarks in ARDS (2, 7). Such proinflammatory cytokines then recruit neutrophils to the lung, which release toxic mediators such as reactive oxygen species and proteases, leading to further inflammation and oxidative cell damage that results in changes in the RTLF and might also be reflected in increased PFR, as indicated in the present study (2, 3, 7). During the experiment, we sampled plasma over time for monitoring of cytokine release. We found significant increases in TNF-\u03b1 and IL-10 after 120 min and significant increases in IL-6, -8, -12, and -1\u03b2 after 180 min in all 7 animals who received LPS and developed ARDS, which is similar to cytokine profiles in other porcine models of ALI and ARDS (12). Importantly, the rapid and massive increases of TNF-\u03b1, IL1-\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 that were observed in our model have been shown to be linked to mortality in ARDS patients (9). Interestingly, the PFR increased 60\u2013120 min before an increase in cytokines could be detected, indicating that online monitoring of particle flow may be a new, complementary approach in the clinic for early detection of ARDS.",
