The more viscous layer of mucus is at the surface, the more liquid layer at the ciliary site. Bacteria, for example, stick within this viscous mucus and can be transported toward the larynx. The cough reflex in addition helps to expel this material from the airways. An example how important this system works can be seen in patients with immotile cilia syndrome, where an inherent gene defect causes uncoordinated ciliary beating and results in defective clearance of mucus and subsequent recurrent infections [2, 3].",

Macrophages constantly patrol throughout the lung, ingesting every inhaled foreign material. Macrophages in contrast to monocytes live longer due to a genetic shift toward antiapoptosis by downregulating PTEN [8]. Macrophages also express Toll-like receptors (TLR2, TLR4) and CD14 and interact with SPA and CD44 to exert different functions such as release of antibacterial proteins/peptides [9]. Granulocytes interact with macrophages: if large amount of bacteria are inhaled, macrophages direct neutrophils to the site of infection, whereas small amounts of bacteria might be cleared by macrophages alone. Removal of apoptotic neutrophils requires macrophages, and this in turn decreases the inflammatory response and neutrophil influx [4]. Neutrophils are able to kill many phagocytosed bacteria by producing large amounts of oxygen radicals (superoxide anions) in their lysosomes and fusing them with the phagosomes. Neutrophils are produced in the bone marrow and released from there by cytokine stimuli. Once they enter the circulation, their apoptotic program is activated. They enter the infectious site using adhesion molecules on endothelia in due time and exert their function. This is facilitated by integrins and also other adhesins. Once within the interstitium, neutrophils move along gradients of chemokines and also acidic pH.",

These molecules are increased secreted in lung injury and inflammation [10]. In cigarette smokers the immune barrier function is impaired by a decreased release of secretory component, which in turn also decreases the transcytosis of IgA [11]. One of the most important functions of IgA secreted at the lining fluid is opsonization of different bacteria [12].",

Under inflammatory conditions a Thelper1 response is favored, whereas Thelper2 responses require another mechanism [13]. Dendritic cells, for example, confronted with mycobacteria will induce differentiation of CD4+ to CD4+17+ cells and also induce Toll receptor 9 expression resulting in granuloma formation [14]. Some subpopulations of dendritic cells can induce immune tolerance and exhaustion, which might play a role in certain diseases, but this will be discussed in another chapter.",

Capillaries are widened (hyperemia) and the endothelial gaps are opened. Fluid from the blood enters into the alveolar spaces (inflammatory edema) and proteins start to coagulate (fibrin cloths). This initial stage is followed by an entry of red blood cells, which undergo lysis, contributing to fibrinogenesis. In this stage fibrin nets are seen mixed with red blood cells, scattered macrophages, and neutrophils. This corresponds to the macroscopic picture of hemorrhagic pneumonia (dark red cut surface, heavy lung, edematous fluid rinsing from the cut surface). After 1 day dense infiltrations by neutrophils appear, mixed with fibrin nets completely filling the alveolar spaces (Fig. 8.6). Capillaries are still hyperemic and widened. Macroscopically the cut surface changes to a gray-red color, due to the massive infiltration by granulocytes. Since the alveoli are completely filled by cells and fibrin, the consistency is similar to liver (hepatic consolidation or hepatization). Granulocytes ingesting and degrading bacteria also die because of liberation of toxic lysosomal enzymes accumulate lipids within their cytoplasm, which macroscopically gives the cut surface a yellow tone (usually by day 2\u20133; Fig. 8.7). After 6\u20137 days clearance of the alveoli starts: neutrophils have degraded the bacteria, macrophages clear the debris from dying neutrophils, fibrin is lysed by the enzymes from macrophages and granulocytes, and finally the alveoli are filled by air again. Under normal condition the pneumonia resolves within 10\u201314 days without remnants of the infectious episode.\n\n\n",

The basement membrane is either preserved or also destroyed (especially in viral infection).

In some cases the progression of the disease might be blocked by antiprotease treatment [19]. In more recent time extracorporeal oxygenation or NO treatment has shown some benefit. If the patient survives the acute phase, DAD will be organized, which is essentially an organizing pneumonia, by some authors also labeled organizing DAD: granulation tissue grows into the alveoli and hyaline membranes are incorporated into the plugs. Remnants of hyaline membranes can be demonstrated several weeks after the initial injury (Figs. 8.11, 8.12, and 8.13). If a tissue biopsy or an autopsy specimen is available early on in the course of the disease, the etiology might be elaborated: in viral infection inclusion bodies can be seen, which can present either as nice large inclusion bodies (CMV, RSV) or by red-violet stained nucleic acids forming ill-defined speckles in nuclei and/or cytoplasm (adenovirus) [20]. This is followed by atypical proliferation and transformation of pneumocytes type II (Fig. 8.14). Typically the infected cell shows enlargement, an atypical large bizarre nucleus, and an accentuated nuclear membrane due to increased nucleic acid traffic induced by the virus. These cellular features can last for several months. In contrast to atypical pneumocyte hyperplasia (AAH), these atypical cells are singles and do not form a continuous layer along the alveolar wall. Rickettsia infection results in less pronounced proliferation of pneumocytes. In shock and drug-induced DAD, the endothelia will undergo apoptosis and necrosis, and fibrin cloths might be seen in capillaries (Fig. 8.10). In these cases the alveolar septa are widened and edematous. Inflammatory cells are scarce or absent. In later stages of drug pneumonia, scattered eosinophils are encountered \u2013 their function being completely unknown.\n\n\n\nWhat are the characteristics of DAD?Edematous fluid accumulation in alveoli and in the interstitium (depending on the time course)Fibrin cloths in alveoli with/without hyaline membranesScarce inflammatory infiltrates (neutrophils and/or lymphocytes, etiology dependent)Minor diagnostic but etiologically important features are damage of pneumocytes, endothelial cells, fibrin thrombi in small blood vessels, and regeneration \u00b1 atypia\n\n",

The main difference stated by the author was the absence of hyaline membranes and the presence of fibrin cloths. The underlying causes were similar to classical DAD/AIP, so the author concluded that this might be a variant of DAD. However, some aspects have never been clarified: Fibrin exudation and clothing is seen early in DAD (see also Fig. 8.9), so the earliest phase of DAD does not present with hyaline membranes \u2013 these are formed later on due to respiration, which compresses fibrin into hyaline membranes. Rarely DAD might also present with a multifocal pattern, which includes a timely heterogeneity: acute fibrinous exudation in one, organizing DAD in another area [22]. Within the underlying cause, similar diseases as in DAD were found, including rare cases of acute hypersensitivity pneumonia [21, 23].",

In addition to DAD, also a foreign body granulomatous reaction might be seen, depending on the time the child has survived. In silent nocturnal aspiration, children swallow milk from breast-feeding and aspirate small amounts. This causes scattered ground glass opacities on CT scan and lipid pneumonia on histology.

The invader or a toxic substance is isolated by granulation tissue or is phagocytosed and degraded simply by macrophages as part of the innate immune system. If these cells can kill the invading organism, no further defense line is required. If the invader cannot be ingested and degraded by these cells, histiocytes and macrophages can form foreign body giant cells, which are more efficient in phagocytosis and degradation. These cells together form foreign body granulomas. In every case the invading organism cannot be killed by phagocytosis, another defense line is activated, which includes immune mechanisms. This more powerful line of defense is the epithelioid cell granuloma. The driving forces, which induce granuloma formation, are the macrophages, the antigen-presenting cells, such as Langerhans and dendritic reticulum cells, and the T and B lymphocytes [53\u201356]. Among the different cytokines released are interleukins 1\u03b2, 2, 3, 8, 10, 12, 17, macrophage migration inhibitory factor 1 (MIF1), IFN\u03b3, and TNF\u03b1. How these factors act and interact is still not understood; however, macrophages and lymphocytes are activated and immobilized. This is followed by the cytokine-induced transformation of macrophages into epithelioid and foreign body giant cells [57\u201362]. Giant cells can be either formed by fusion of macrophages or by nuclear division without cell division. Foreign body giant cells further on differentiate into Langhans giant cells. This process of transformation is maintained by the same secretory factors, which are produced in larger quantities by the epithelioid cells and by infiltrating lymphocytes [63].",

Among them are trehalose-6,6\u2032-dimycolate, lipoarabinomannan, and 65 kDa antigen of mycobacterial capsule (a chaperonin) [61, 62]. These products stimulate granuloma formation by the induction of cytokine gene expression, mainly IL1\u03b2 or TNF\u03b1. In addition they have other effects, like induction of apoptosis, enhancing coagulation, and together release TNF\u03b1, which subsequently induce necrosis by occlusion of small blood vessels. The mycobacterial chaperonin also stimulates monocytes to express mRNA for TNF\u03b1 and to release IL6 and IL8, cytokines which are chemoattractants for lymphocytes. In some patients necrotizing and non-necrotizing epithelioid cell granulomas, induced by M. tuberculosis, can be found side by side. The underlying mechanism is not completely understood. One possible explanation might be the mycobacterial burden: large amounts of mycobacteria release large quantities of coagulation factors and thus induce infarct-like necrosis. Another explanation is within the interaction of virulent stains of mycobacteria and host defense cells [63].",

Giant cells can be either formed by cell fusion or by incomplete cell division (no cytoplasmic division). Both ways have been proven experimentally [56, 64, 65]. First foreign body giant cells are formed, which later reorganize into Langhans cells. These are characterized by a nuclear row opposite to the phagocytic pole of the cell. Lymphocytes are usually layered at the outer granuloma shell and can be numerous or sparse. Phenotypically these are T lymphocytes, whereas B lymphocytes are loosely arranged outside the granulomas. T-helper-1 and T-helper-2 and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD8+) can be present in the granulomas, with the composition depending on the type of underlying disease. This will be discussed later.\n\n",

Lung lesions and involvement of other organ systems are rarely encountered; however, they do occur in end-stage disease (personal communication).

In cases of borderline tuberculoid reaction (mixture of tuberculoid and lepromatous leprosy), the granulomas tend to be more loose than those in tuberculosis (Fig. 8.46). The differentiation of macrophages and histiocytes into epithelioid cells is not as pronounced as in the tuberculoid form.

These monocytoid cells differentiate into epithelioid and giant cells. Early on foreign body as well as Langhans giant cells can be seen. Later on lymphocytes become scarce, and the granulomas stick out from an otherwise not inflamed parenchyma (Figs. 8.61, 8.62, and 8.63). Well-formed granulomas undergo fibrosis, which usually starts from the outside of the granuloma in a concentric fashion. Finally a hyalinized granuloma remains, which will show an occasional epithelioid cell (Fig. 8.36). In fully developed granulomas, lymphatic vessels can be seen transversing the granuloma, sometimes also capillaries. A granulomatous vasculitis pattern can be seen in some cases (Fig. 8.64). Granulomas are usually within the interstitium and do not show any association with the airway epithelium. Some features have been regarded as specific, like asteroid, Schaumann, and conchoid bodies in the Langhans cells. However, these structures can be seen in all Langhans cell containing granulomas of diverse etiology and are of no help in making the diagnosis of sarcoidosis. Calcium oxalate, carbonate, and pyrophosphate crystals can be found in granulomas and in Schaumann bodies; however, they are not diagnostic too (Fig. 8.65). A T-helper lymphocyte (CD3+CD4+)-dominated alveolitis in the BAL might supplement the histologic diagnosis.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The granulomas can usually confluent, forming large nodules identical to nodular sarcoidosis; the lymphocytic rim is usually prominent (Figs. 8.69 and 8.70). Liebow originally described this disease as a separate entity [72], because he assumed that it has features in between Wegener\u2019s granulomatosis (vasculitis, ischemic necrosis) and sarcoidosis (nodular aggregates of epithelioid cell granulomas). Based on our own observation and research, we proposed NSG as a variant of sarcoidosis, characterized by nodular aggregates of epithelioid cell granulomas, granulomatous vasculitis, and ischemic infarcts [73, 74]: granulomatous vasculitis is a feature in NSG and sarcoidosis, ischemic necrosis in NSG is due to lumen obstruction induced by vasculitis, and finally like sarcoidosis NSG is also a systemic disease involving several organs (liver, spleen, ocular adnexa, lymph nodes, etc.).\n\n",

In addition the apoptosis pathway is downregulated by protein 14-3-3. So probably the underlying defect in sarcoidosis might be a prolonged proliferation of lymphocytes and macrophages and a longer survival of these activated cells, which then causes disease [88]. The mechanism by which mycobacteria or propionibacteria can trigger this inflammatory reaction is still unclear, but the answer might be found in the mechanisms of antigen processing and presentation. Other theories are focusing on polymorphisms of different genes such as TNF\u03b2 and HSP70 [89]. A lot of research has focused on polymorphisms within the HLA system. HLADRB1*0301/DQB1*0201 has been linked to good prognosis and Lofgren syndrome; a linkage study found genetic alterations on chromosome 5 in African American sarcoidosis patients, whereas another linkage to chromosome 6 (identified as BTNL2 gene) was found in a German population [90]. Finally studies have focused on the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family, which are responsible for the processing of antigens and also dictate the type of immune reactions. Modifications within the TLR4 might be associated with the susceptibility for sarcoidosis [91].",

The granulomas tend to be larger than in EAA/HP or sarcoidosis; however, it is impossible to differentiate them morphologically from sarcoidosis. The granuloma itself is identical to the granuloma in sarcoidosis (Fig. 8.71). As in sarcoidosis no infectious organisms can be demonstrated in the granulomas. No larger series of BAL have been reported in berylliosis so far. However, in an experimental investigation, a predominance of T-helper lymphocytes has been reported, making BAL an unsuitable tool for the differentiation of berylliosis and sarcoidosis. For the diagnosis a lymphocyte transformation test is usually recommended, and an exposure history is necessary. The exact cause of berylliosis is still unclear. Beryllium oxide is a molecule, too small to induce an allergic reaction. Beryllium-protein complexes most probable induce this reaction. Beryllium might form tetrameric complexes with amino acids and alter the tertiary structure of proteins, subsequently eliciting an allergic reaction [92, 93]. A genetic predisposition for chronic allergic berylliosis has been proven [94], and recently tetramers of beryllium-loaded HLADP2-mimotope and HLADP2-plexin A4 have been detected in patients. This tetramers bind specifically to CD4+T cells and might elicit the allergic reaction [95]. By electron microscopy and EDAX analysis, beryllium oxide can be proven in the granulomas. It should be reminded that in routinely processed specimen, the beryllium oxide is often leached out from the tissue by the solvents used for fixation, dehydration, and embedding. The same is true for an analysis, using laser-assisted mass spectrophotometry (LAMA) in paraffin-embedded tissues.\n",

In open lung biopsies, epithelioid cell granulomas are frequently seen in EAA/HP, whereas they are quite rare in transbronchial biopsies. This might be a technical and distribution phenomenon: whereas granulomas in sarcoidosis are easily found in the bronchial mucosa, in EAA/HP the granulomas are more frequent in the periphery of the lung, usually distributed along small blood vessels (venules, capillaries; Fig. 8.72). Granulomas are, however, not the diagnostic requirement of EAA/HP: a dense lymphocytic interstitial infiltration centered upon small blood vessels alone raises the differential diagnosis of EAA/HP (Fig. 8.72a). As in sarcoidosis all special stains for infectious organisms are negative. In contrast to sarcoidosis, the granulomas in EAA/HP are more loosely organized; they have usually a broader rim of lymphocytes, and the lymphocytic infiltration spills over into the adjacent alveolar septa. In active disease there may be a lymphocytic interstitial infiltration with or without lymph follicle hyperplasia. Very helpful is the BAL: in EAA/HP there is a lymphocytic alveolitis with a predominance of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD8+, CD11a+). The CD4/CD8 ratio should be <0.8. However, it should be mentioned that a few exceptions to this rule have been reported. There is also a time effect: under antigen restriction the helper-suppressor ratio normalizes within a week and in some cases may even become >1.0 within a few days (unpublished personal observations).\n",

In addition there is usually a dense infiltrate of eosinophils. In this classic variant, BCG is induced by an allergic reaction against different types of fungi, most often members of the Aspergillus family (Fig. 8.76). However, AFS and GMS stains should always be performed to exclude mycobacteria, especially when the inflammatory infiltrates contain many neutrophils (Fig. 8.76d). Another organism Actinomyces can present with bronchocentric granulomatosis, again with neutrophils in the necrotic center. In all these cases, BCG is an infectious disease, not allergic. If AFS is negative, fungal remnants are proven by GMS or PAS stains, and eosinophils are admixed to the granulomas, a diagnosis of bronchocentric granulomatosis as a variant of allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis/aspergillosis (ABPM/A) can be made. In my experience, it is often necessary to perform serial sections to demonstrate the fungus. The clinical information about positive allergy tests might be helpful. Combinations of type 1 and 4 immune reactions can be seen in this form of ABPM. In rare cases bronchocentric, necrotizing granulomatosis might also be seen in the setting of Wegener\u2019s disease.

An identification of M. tuberculosis in an immunocompromised patient and non-necrotizing epithelioid cell granulomas as the reaction of the host can be interpreted as a good prognostic sign, because the host can mount an immune reaction against these mycobacteria. In sarcoidosis CD4/CD8 ratios >3.5 are usually good prognostic indicators.

We prefer the auramine-rhodamine stain, because in paucibacillary tuberculosis the mycobacteria are easier detected: they are orange fluorescent in a black background (Fig. 8.81). Based on these reactions, a differential diagnosis of tuberculosis or mycobacteriosis can be made. It should be noted that mycobacteria can also be silver impregnated by the GMS stain (Fig. 8.82). The nontuberculous mycobacteria are sometimes described as having a shorter and thicker appearance in AFS; however, this should always be proven by PCR and culture. In every case of purulent pneumonia, a Gram stain should be added to the panel of special stains. Although an identification of a species is not possible, the information about gram-positive or gram-negative cocci or bacilli will already help the clinician to select possible antibiotics for treatment, until the organism has been identified by either culture or PCR. In all cases where a BAL is submitted together with the biopsy, this material is even better to find and identify the organisms, either bacteria, fungi, or parasites (Fig. 8.83).\n\n\n",

Other sequences, which characterize mycobacteria in general, are the DNA coding for the 16S rRNA and the 32 kDa protein. The insertion sequence IS 6110 can be used to demonstrate DNA of M. tuberculosis, M. bovis, M. africanum, and all members of the M. tuberculosis complex (Fig. 8.85). For the demonstration of MOTT, different strategies are available: either a multiplex PCR using unique sequences for different mycobacteria in one PCR run (Fig. 8.86) or the more time-consuming amplification of the 16S rRNA coding gene and sequencing of the amplicon can be done. The base exchanges characteristic for different mycobacteria can then be used for species typing. Alternatively amplicons can also be digested by restriction enzymes and the species identified by the length of the fragments [78, 100, 101].\n\n",

He did not divide them into idiopathic or those with known etiology but recognized that there can be different etiology present behind each of these entities. Katzenstein\u2019s updates from 1993 to 1998 [105, 106] was the next major step, adding NSIP (nonspecific interstitial pneumonia) to the list of UIP, DIP, BIP, and AIP/DAD, and following the debate at that time structured the classification into idiopathic and non-idiopathic (=known etiology). Therefore she removed LIP and GIP, because an etiology could be assigned to them. The original BIP was renamed into bronchiolitis obliterans-organizing pneumonia (BOOP) [107], a term which was long before known as \u201cpneumonia with carnification\u201d (karnifizierende Pneumonie) in the German literature. Later on Mueller and Colby showed a radiologic-pathologic correlation and used the previously created name BOOP (bronchiolitis obliterans-organizing pneumonia) [108, 109] instead of BIP.",

            "text": "The cause and the etiology of IPF/UIP are not well understood. There is a working hypothesis, which can explain some of the features. The disease starts with an as yet unidentified epithelial injury causing apoptosis of pneumocytes [119\u2013122]. Inflammatory signals released by the dying pneumocytes cause transformation and proliferation of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts in a myxoid stroma and repair [123] (so-called fibroblastic focus). Genetic abnormalities may underlie these apoptotic response: in the recent years, research in familial forms of IPF has highlighted the importance of surfactant apoproteins in maintaining a homeostasis between injury and repair and that mutations in the surfactant apoprotein C gene might be causally related to the development of familial IPF [124]. In these familial IPF, mutations in genes encoding surfactant apoprotein C and A2 increase endoplasmic stress reactions in pneumocytes type II, and in addition mutations in the telomerase genes TERT and TERC are responsible for telomere shortening probably decreasing the pool of peripheral lung stem cells and thus impairing repair and regeneration [125]. This later defects are also found in sporadic IPF cases. Therefore inhalation of any kind of toxic material from the environment might cause an overwhelming oxidative stress reaction leading to increased apoptosis of pneumocytes and impaired regeneration [126]. This fits quite well into the epidemiology of IPF patients: the majority are smokers; some have a history of environmental dust exposure [127, 128]. There is also evidence of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of pneumocytes into myofibroblasts, but also scattered bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells seem to move into these foci [129\u2013131] (Fig. 8.89). These foci undergo maturation with collagen deposition, and finally the process results in fibrosis of alveolar septa and bronchiolar walls [121]. This in turn causes obstruction of the terminal airways resulting in cystic destruction of the remaining peripheral lobules, giving rise to honeycombing and remodeling of the lung parenchyma [122, 132, 133]. Recently additional mutations have been identified in IPF: a mutation of MUC5B gene promoter was shown to be associated with risk for IPF and also fibrosing NSIP [134], and another gene mutation in dyskerin (DKC1) was associated with familial IPF [135]. Whereas the function of MUC5B is not explored, dyskerin cooperates with hTERT and thus may be another variant of this complex scenario. IPF develops stepwise, which means there are lung lobules not affected yet looking normal, whereas others are destroyed or even completely lost to fibrosis and scarring. This is meant by the term \u201ctimely heterogeneity\u201d (Fig. 8.90).\n\n",

They do not project into the alveolar lumen. In early stages they are composed of myofibroblasts and fibroblasts in an immature myxoid matrix. This matrix will stain for immature collagen and reticulin fibers. The overlaying surface is either denuded (no pneumocytes) or can show pneumocyte regeneration with a lot of reactive changes of the nuclei, even epithelial giant cells can be present (Figs. 8.91, 8.92, and 8.93). When the focus get\u2019s older, mature collagen appears and the cells look more like fibrocytes. The overlaying epithelium looks reactive and usually has a type II or bronchiolar cell appearance.\n\n\nThe honeycomb lesion was originally defined by radiologists as a single or multicystic lesion within a fibrotic lung area [136]. Given the differences in resolution between HRCT and histology, there is a substantial difference in size between the two. Pathologically a so-called honeycomb lesion is a cystic lung lesion involving a secondary lobule. This lobule has lost most of the peripheral alveoli, shows a cystic central area composed of bronchioles and centroacinar structures, covered by a cuboidal and cylindrical epithelium, resembling bronchiolar epithelium and transformed pneumocytes type II (Fig. 8.94). In some cases a pseudostratified squamous-looking epithelium can be present. The cyst walls are fibrotic and often merge with scarred lung tissue or large fibrotic areas involving sometimes a subsegment of the lung. Within the lumen mucus can accumulate, and in late stage this can be the starting point for secondary infection and bronchopneumonia causing death of the patient (Figs. 8.95 and 8.96). I prefer the term lobular cystic lung remodeling (LCR) instead of honeycombing, because of the size differences between HRCT and microscopy.\n\n\nThe areas of fibrosis and scarring and the uninvolved lung tissue (heterogeneity) do not need an explanation. But what about inflammation? From what we understand presently, IPF/UIP is not an immune-driven or classic inflammatory disease. Therefore we do not expect inflammatory cells within the myofibroblastic foci. If lymphocytes appear in numbers (>10/HPF) within a myofibroblast focus, this should raise the possibility of an underlying immune reaction (Figs. 8.97 and 8.98). The appearance of granulocytes within these foci should prompt the search of remnants of hyaline membranes, because this may represent organizing DAD.\n\n\n",

            "text": "NSIP is a diffuse interstitial pneumonia, characterized by loose lymphocytic, macrophagocytic, and histiocytic cell infiltration within alveolar septa combined with mild fibrosis. There is no timely heterogeneity, meaning that the lesions seem to have appeared at the same time. Hyperplasia of the bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) is usually not present [116, 143]. The lung architecture is preserved in contrast to UIP, and cystic destruction is absent. Two forms are discerned, which in some cases might represent timely sequences of the disease: the cellular and fibrotic type (Figs. 8.104, 8.105, 8.106, and 8.107). Both behave different; the cellular type has a better prognosis, whereas the fibrotic variant is more close to UIP [110]. In the etiologic background, NSIP is most often associated with autoimmune diseases, especially with collagen vascular diseases [28, 144\u2013147]. An association with drug-induced pneumonia and also with allergic diseases such as extrinsic allergic alveolitis/hypersensitivity pneumonia (EAA/HP) has also been reported [148, 149]. Only those cases without an identifiable etiology are labeled as idiopathic NSIP. However, the morphologic pattern is identical; therefore in most instances, idiopathic NSIP remains a clinical diagnosis. There are some exceptions: in cases where additional features such as epithelioid cell granulomas are identified, this will favor EAA/HP; an additional pathology of endothelia could point to drug-induced disease. Clinically NSIP shows diffuse infiltrations, corresponding to ground glass opacities on HRCT. Symptoms as in the other interstitial lung diseases are quite unspecific. Many patients with NSIP will respond to corticosteroid and/or immunosuppressive drug treatment, but also spontaneous resolution of the disease has been reported [150, 151]. So far no genetic factors leading to NSIP have been identified.\n\n\n\nSo what makes this diagnosis?The lung architecture is preserved. On low power the alveolar walls, interlobular septa, and primary as well as secondary lobules can be outlined (draw lines along alveolar walls on a digitized photograph, this helps in understanding).Diffuse infiltrates composed of lymphocytes macrophages and histiocytic cells, usually few plasma cells.If fibrosis is present, this usually causes no distortion of the lung architecture.Fibrosis is diffuse, not merging with scars. Inflammatory infiltrates in cases of fibrosing NSIP are usually scarce.Non-necrotizing granulomas can be present in certain cases (EAA/HP); however they should not be encountered in idiopathic NSIP.Hyperplasia of BALT is absent.\n\n",

On HRCT OP/COP shows a pattern with combinations of ground glass opacities and consolidations and the almost diagnostic tree-in-bud pattern, sometimes also reticulonodular pattern [152] (Fig. 8.108). In rare cases the consolidation can mimic a tumor [153]. Histologically the hallmark of OP is an intra-alveolar granulation tissue, the so-called Masson body (Fig. 8.109). It consists of proliferating fibroblasts and myofibroblasts with inflammatory cells like neutrophils, lymphocytes, histiocytes, and macrophages. Hemosiderin-laden macrophages are often present. The granulation tissue can start from the wall of bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli. There is usually a defect of the epithelial layer and also the basal lamina. Fibroblasts and myofibroblasts grow into the defect; however, in contrast to normal repair, the granulation tissue does not stop but continuously grows into the airspaces, filling these completely or incompletely. In later stages pneumocytes will grow over these granulation tissue plugs and therefore a slit-like airspace can be formed (Fig. 8.110) [153]. The amount of inflammatory cells within the granulation tissue depends on the cause of OP. The morphologic pattern of organizing pneumonia (OP) has a very wide range of etiologies (Table 8.9).\n\n\n\n",

If looking for the etiology, one should also closely investigate the small blood vessels and the regenerating pneumocytes: viral inclusion bodies might be still visible, scattered neutrophilic granulocytes can be found in the granulation tissue in cases of bacterial or fungal infection, and eosinophils might be seen pointing to a previous drug-induced pneumonia. In virus-induced pneumonias another feature can be found, even after several months: single transformed pneumocytes showing atypical nuclei and a homogenously stained smudged chromatin pattern (Fig. 8.111). In drug-induced and metabolic as well as in autoimmune diseases, the vascular walls can show various structural changes making an etiology-based diagnosis probable: eccentric vasculopathy with scattered lymphocytes and without endothelial damage might point to deposition of idiotypic-anti-idiotypic immune complexes (without complement activation; Fig. 8.112) and endothelial damage with fibrosis and repair can point toward drug-induced damage (Fig. 8.113).\n\n\nSo what are the diagnostic features?Granulation tissue growing into bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli, usually with remnants of inflammatory cellsFibrotic occlusion of whole lobules or remaining slit-like spaces covered by pneumocytesA mixture of inflammatory cells within these granulation tissue plugs depending on the cause of previous damage\n\n",
