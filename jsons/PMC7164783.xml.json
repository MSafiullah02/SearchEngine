Because of widespread adamantine resistance, the treatment of influenza is at present limited to the neuraminidase inhibitors, oseltamivir and zanamivir. New drugs with novel mechanisms of action that can be used alone or in combination with neuraminidase inhibitors are urgently needed to improve treatment outcomes and mitigate risks of resistance.",

For participants diagnosed with influenza by culture or RT-PCR at baseline, we measured influenza antibody titres by haemagglutination inhibition assay from serum samples obtained at baseline and at day 28 to assess effect of treatment on humoral immune response. Reference antigens used for measurement of antibody titres were H1/A/California/7/2009, H3/A/Perth/16/2009, and B/Brisbane/60/2008.

Eight (3\u00b78%) of 212 participants in the placebo group discontinued treatment because of an adverse event compared with two (1%) of 201 in the nitazoxanide 300 mg group and two (<1%) of 211 in the nitazoxanide 600 mg group. Laboratory values did not change significantly for any of the treatment groups (data not shown). Chromaturia (yellowish urine) was reported by six (3%) participants in the nitazoxanide 300 mg group and eight (4%) participants in the nitazoxanide 600 mg group compared with none in the placebo group. This event was probably attributed to the colour of nitazoxanide metabolites.

In this study, we enrolled participants within 48 h of symptom onset, whereas most clinical trials of neuraminidase inhibitors enrolled participants within 36 h of symptom onset. Time to symptom alleviation was fastest in the subset enrolled within 36 h of symptom onset into the nitazoxanide 600 mg group.PanelResearch in context\nSystematic review\nWe searched PubMed for systematic reviews and meta-analyses published in English language between Jan 1, 2009, and Jan 29, 2014, with the search terms \u201cinfluenza treatment\u201d, \u201cinfluenza clinical trial\u201d, \u201coseltamivir\u201d, \u201czanamivir\u201d, and \u201cneuraminidase inhibitor\u201d. With the same search terms, we also searched for articles published in English between Jan 1, 1990, and Jan 29, 2014, reporting placebo-controlled clinical trials of drugs for treatment of influenza. We identified nine systematic reviews or meta-analyses within the past 5 years related to the use of the neuraminidase inhibitors, oseltamivir and zanamivir, and we identified several articles reporting randomised placebo-controlled clinical trials reporting a treatment effect of oral oseltamivir, inhaled zanamivir, or intravenous peramivir8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26 (another neuraminidase inhibitor) in reducing the time from first dose to alleviation of symptoms in participants with acute uncomplicated influenza. Articles have also reported beneficial treatment effect of oseltamivir and zanamivir in otherwise healthy children infected with influenza. Evidence to support treatment benefits of neuraminidase inhibitors in elderly and at-risk groups or their effects on rates of admission to hospital and mortality was insufficient.\nInterpretation\nIn our trial, oral administration of nitazoxanide 600 mg twice daily for 5 days reduced the time to alleviation of symptoms of influenza in otherwise healthy adults and adolescents by roughly 1 day. Although many factors can affect the size of treatment effect observed in different clinical trials, the effect recorded in this trial is similar to that previously reported for the neuraminidase inhibitors.8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 17, 18, 27 Data from this trial suggest a treatment benefit of nitazoxanide in participants without influenza or other documented viral infection\u2014a finding that has not been reported for the neuraminidase inhibitors. Importantly, nitazoxanide possesses a novel mechanism of action against influenza viruses. A new drug with a different mechanism of action could ultimately prove beneficial in overcoming resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors or in providing more potent therapy when used in combination with existing drugs. As a first step, it has been important to show effectiveness of nitazoxanide in a randomised placebo controlled trial by use of a method established for licensure of existing drugs. Further studies are warranted to confirm our findings and to assess efficacy of nitazoxanide alone or in combination with existing drugs in seriously ill patients and those at risk of influenza complications.",

In the 600 mg dose group, the drug was given at a dose that is 20% higher and for a duration of therapy that is 67% longer than the drug's approved dose for treatment of intestinal infections.6 This increase in dose and duration did not result in any significant change in the known side-effect profile.

The absence of statistical significance for the 300 mg treatment group might reflect an absence of statistical power because only about 60% of the planned number of participants were recruited. Although this trial enrolled participants with influenza AH3N2, ApH1N1, and B, examination of the efficacy and safety of the drug against influenza strains from another season would be beneficial. The drug does not seem to be associated with resistance, as might be expected because of its mechanism of action, but further studies to assess the potential for resistance would be valuable. Furthermore, although this clinical trial has shown a treatment effect in otherwise healthy participants aged 12\u201365 years, the effect of the drug still needs to be studied in children and patients with serious illness or those at risk of influenza complications.",
