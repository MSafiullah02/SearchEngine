We used Interferon-\u03b1, Lopinavir/Ritonavir and Arbidol for virus inhibition according to previous clinical experience but the unified treatment plan is still lack. A retrospective study revealed that proper use of corticosteroid in confirmed critical SARS resulted in lowered mortality and shorter hospitalization stay [15] . Another study also showed that low-to-moderate-dose corticosteroids might reduce mortality of influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 viral pneumonia patients with PaO2 /FiO2 <300 mm Hg [16] . In this study, corticosteroid therapy was initiated if COVID-19 patients with PaO2/FiO2<300mmHg had quicker disease progression, higher temperature and more lung inflammatory exudation, their glucocorticoid application rate (28.68%) was significantly higher than that in younger patients (9.36%). To avoid side effects of corticosteroid, its dosage was decreased into 40-80 mg/daily. Until now, only two cases of GI tract bleeding and 10 cases of hyperglycemia were identified in this study, with no secondary bacteria and fungi infection. Therefore, the application of antibiotics and anti-fungi drugs was also lower in Zhejiang province than in Wuhan.",

According to accumulated reports from Wuhan, the rate of severe/critical type and mortality were relatively high, reaching 15% in one study [2] . Additionally, another study revealed that the median age for ICU and non-ICU patients were 66y and 51y, with mortality of 4.3% [10] .

Secondly, the comprehensive analysis of older patients with COVID-19 on national level is urgently needed, which will provide data that are more reliable. Thirdly, though we summarized the application of antiviral therapy and glucocorticoids usage in the older patients with COVID-19, it is still lack of randomized clinical trials to provide high quality evidence. Finally, the data regarding the outcomes of older patients with COVID-19 need to be further investigated, for most older patients were still under treatment in hospital. 15 In summary, we reported the specific epidemiological and clinical features of older patients with COVID-19, including significantly higher female gender, body temperature, familiar clustering, co-existing of basic diseases and rate of severe/critical type. 28 Figure 1 ",

For extreme high fever, older patients also had significantly higher rate of high temperature (T>39\u2103) (older vs younger groups: 13.97% vs 7.21%, P=0.010) than that in younger patients.On admission, significantly more patients in older group had lymphocytopenia (older vsyounger groups: 30.88% vs 14.11%, P<0.001) and lower level of haemoglobin (older vs younger groups: 129g/L vs 140g/L, P<0.001). Furthermore, there were significantly decreased level of albumin (older vs younger groups: 39.2g/L vs 41.7g/L, P<0.001), elevated level of aspartate aminotransferase (older vs younger groups: 28U/L vs 24U/L, P=0.002), increased level of creatine kinase (74.5U/L vs 67.0U/L, P=0.039) and lactate dehydrogenase (244.0U/L vs 204.0U/L, P<0.001) in older group. Concerning infection-related parameters, C-reactive protein (CRP) was significantly increased in older group than that in younger group (older vs younger groups: 19.0mg/L vs 6.75mg/L, P<0.001). CT scan is pivotal for disease identification and diagnosis, significantly more patients in the older group presented multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity. Treatment and outcomes COVID-19 patients were isolated in designated hospitals with supportive and empiric medication. There were 117 patients (86.03%) in older group and 551 (84.51%) patients in younger group administrated with antiviral treatment, with a median period from onset of illness to antiviral therapy of 3 days and median antiviral duration of 11 days for both groups. There were 192 and 43 patients received zInterferon-\u03b1 sprays, lopinavir and ritonavir 2 tablets (500 mg) twice daily and arbidol hydrochloride capsules (2 tablets three times daily); 140 and 25 patients received Interferon-\u03b1 sprays and Lopinavir/Ritonavir; 61 and 12 patients received Lopinavir/Ritonavir and Arbidol; 31 and 10 patients received Interferon-\u03b1 sprays and Arbidol, in younger group and older group respectively. There were no difference regarding the antiviral regimen between two groups. Glucocorticoid therapy is considered if",
