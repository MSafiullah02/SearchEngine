In 2018, Africa reported 213/229 million (93%) of all malaria cases, 204/229 million (89%) of schistosomiasis cases, and 271/1068 million (25%) of soil-transmitted helminth cases globally. In contrast, Europe reported 1.5/3.3 million (45%) of global COVID-19 cases and 142,667/238,628 (59%) deaths. Europe had 5.8/1068 million (0.55%) soil-transmitted helminths cases and no malaria/schistosomiasis cases in 2018. We found an inverse correlation between the incidence of COVID-19 and malaria (r -0.17, p =0.002) and COVID-19 and soil-transmitted helminths (r -0.25, p <0.001). Malaria-endemic countries were less likely to have COVID-19 (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.29-0.90; p =0.02). Similarly, countries endemic for soil-transmitted helminths were less likely to have COVID-19 (OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.13-0.44; p <0.001), as were countries endemic for schistosomiasis (OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.11-0.45; p<0.001). Conclusions: One plausible hypothesis for the comparatively low COVID-19 cases/deaths in parasite-endemic areas is immunomodulation induced by parasites. Studies to elucidate the relationship between parasitic infections and susceptibility to COVID-19 at an individual level are warranted.",

Of note, immune responses to parasitic infections in populations of individuals who relocate from areas of sustained transmission wane (20) . Based on the differences in COVID-19 cases reported between endemic and non-endemic countries, we also suppose that parasite-induced immunomodulatory mechanisms wane among individuals who emigrate from parasiteendemic regions, with subsequent waning of population-based protection from COVID-19.",

Additionally, individuals in malaria endemic regions with stable transmission exhibit clinical immunity to malaria. This is a state in which individuals have detectable malaria parasitemia but remain clinically asymptomatic (25, 26) . The basis of clinical immunity to malaria has been attributed to immunoregulatory mechanisms including regulatory CD4 + T cells which secrete IL-10 and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) (27, 28) . These two cytokines are master immunomodulatory cytokines which block the effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines and thus induce an immunotolerant milieu. The immunotolerance marked by anti-inflammatory cytokines and regulatory T cells induced in individuals with parasitic infections arises from the need to limit pro-inflammatory-cytokine-related immunopathology. It also occurs for gutdwelling helminths and thus cuts across parasitic infections (6) . This immunotolerogenic state typical in individuals living in parasite-endemic areas has been previously reported to reduce vaccine efficacy in these settings in comparison to settings without a high burden of parasitic infections (29, 30) . For example, in Ethiopia, interferon gamma responses following BCG vaccination were noted to be lower in individuals with an active helminth infection. Furthermore, following anti-helminthic treatment, responses to BCG vaccination improved presumably due to clearance of immunomodulatory parasites (31). Parasite immunomodulatory mechanisms have been summarised in Figure 3 .",

Additionally, in this expanding pandemic, different countries and or continents are at different epidemiological phases of the current COVID-19 pandemic that the data we have used in our current analyses could change in the future. Secondly, we cannot rule out the possibility of misclassification of countries as high/low endemic settings as we utilised secondary data for our analysis. The potential non-differential misclassification bias would likely have produced an overestimation of the true odds ratio of the relationship between endemic countries and COVID-19 cases. Thirdly, there is a potential selection bias because we only included countries with COVID-19 cases reported by WHO in this analysis. Finally, our findings are limited by lack of data on confounding factors like population size, climate, immunogenetics/race, nutritional status, gender, other co-infections/co-morbidities, age stratification, and number of tests done per million people which need to be adjusted for and could potentially affect our observed correlations.",
