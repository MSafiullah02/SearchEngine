These benefits include deeper engagement with civil society organisations, stronger public health systems, and the implementation of innovative approaches for disease management. As China celebrates these achievements, it must also devise a roadmap for continuing its record of success, now that the Fund has left.",

The first is a change in mindset. The way China's leaders think about development has progressed, making the public health system more transparent, open, and accountable. This quantum advance in governance derived partly from procedural and reporting requirements that came with China's alliance to the Global Fund. The Chinese Government cofinanced the Global Fund programme, a move that transformed China from an aid recipient into a full and active partner. Such a collaborative arrangement meant that all costs and other procedural details were clearly and publicly allocated, and that all programmes were audited, infusing the system with international standards of transparency.",

Currently, MDR-TB treatment costs about 50 000 RMB (about US$8025) per year. Unless the government covers the cost, while making a simultaneous commitment to improving treatment quality, China might undergo a major public health crisis that could set back its developmental progress by 20 years or more.",
