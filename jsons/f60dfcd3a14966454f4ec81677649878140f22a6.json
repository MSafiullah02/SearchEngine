A small percentage of these patients may require magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for comorbidities. The European Centre for Disease Control recommends healthcare workers use a class 2 or 3 filtering face piece respirator (FFP2 or FFP3), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend an N95 respirator (equivalent to FFP2 and FFP3), or facemask if a respirator is not available, when managing a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19 infection. 3, 4 As a result, staff accompanying patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 are likely to be wearing respirators when they arrive at the MRI room. MRI staff may also be wearing a respirator as part of their personal protective equipment when dealing with these patients. These staff members may not be aware that respirators and facemasks do not have MRI safety documentation and as such require testing. 5 The purpose of this study was to assess a range of currently available respirators and a facemask for the presence of ferromagnetic properties.",

Four commonly available respirators and one facemask were tested. These consisted of a 3M Aura respirator FFP3 1863 (Texas, USA), two Kolmi respirators; FFP2 and FFP3 (Angers, France), a Halyard Technology respirator FFP2 (Georgia, USA), and a Dahlhausen surgical facemask (Cologne, Germany). The respirators and mask were first tested outside the MRI control area for ferromagnetic attraction using a strong hand-held magnet (>1,000 Gauss). 5 They were then placed individually, but not secured, on the face of a threedimensionally printed head phantom outside the MRI room and the phantom was positioned on the imaging table of a 1.5 T MRI unit (Siemens Avanto, Erlangen, Germany). Respirator/mask movement generated by ferromagnetism was recorded. Finally, a gradient-echo sequence was obtained of the head phantom with the respirator or mask secured using manufacturer guidelines to assess for local image artefact.",

When exposed to the handheld magnet it showed strong ferromagnetic attraction such that it was possible to lift the respirator from a flat surface using the magnet. It underwent considerable translational/torque forces when close to the MRI magnet and completely lost contact with the phantom. There was also considerable image artefact on gradient echo imaging (Fig 1a) . Both Kolmi FFP2 and FFP3 respirators also showed strong ferromagnetic properties with the hand-held magnet and could be lifted off a flat table by ferromagnetic attraction to the hand-held magnet. Both respirators also completely lost contact with the phantom when close to the MRI magnet and were associated with considerable artefact on the gradient-echo imaging (Fig 1b and c) . The Halyard FFP2 respirator did not exhibit evidence of ferromagnetism to the hand-held magnet or when resting on the phantom on the MRI table. There was only minimal artefact on gradient-echo imaging (Fig 1d) . The standard disposable Dalhousie surgical mask showed no signs of ferromagnetism. There is a small aluminium strip present to allow the mask be formed over the nasal bridge. This produced minimal local artefact on gradient-echo imaging (Fig 1e) .",

They also reduce exposure to others of the wearer's saliva and respiratory secretions. 4 A FFP2 or FFP3 respirator (equivalent to USA N95 respirator) is a respiratory device designed to achieve a very close facial fit and very efficient filtration of airborne particles. 4 They are designed to form a seal around the nose and mouth. They must be fit tested, and a proper fit cannot be achieved on men with beards. 4 Patients with suspected or proven COVID-19 in whom MRI is required should wear a surgical facemask. 4 This study has shown it is not necessary to remove the metal nosepiece from the Dahlhausen surgical mask as it is not ferromagnetic. Removal would reduce the seal at the nose bridge and risk contamination.",
