Nearly half of all deaths within the first 24 h after trauma are caused by exsanguination and coagulopathy [1]. Massive transfusion (MT), defined as the transfusion of 10 or more units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) in 24 h [1, 2], is required in 3% of patients with trauma. MT is usually unplanned and requires large quantities of blood; however, it is often the differentiating factor between life and death [1]. Delays in activating massive transfusion protocols (MTP) may adversely impact patients\u2019 outcomes, while inappropriate activation may waste resources and incur costs to the institutions. Timely, sustained, and appropriate MTP activation remains a challenge to all trauma centers and the cost-effectiveness process [3\u20136].",

Various scoring systems have been proposed to identify patients in need of MT. Currently, there are nearly two dozen military and civilian prediction scores in the medical literature. However, no universal consensus has been reached, and none of them have been widely adopted [2\u20134, 7\u201322]. Many scores use time-consuming laboratory tests along with physiologic and anatomical parameters [2\u20134, 7, 9\u201312, 14, 20], whereas others use physiologic parameters along with point of care (POC) tests [8, 15, 17\u201319]. However, few of these scores are simple, efficient, and easy to remember and coincidentally are the ones most commonly used in practice. They include the Assessment of Blood Consumption (ABC) score, mostly for penetrating trauma, the Shock Index (heart rate/systolic blood pressure), and the Revised Assessment of Bleeding and Transfusion (RABT) score [8]. However, these scores have several limitations.",

We hypothesized that the incorporation of focused assessment with sonography in trauma (FAST), SI, and serum lactate into one scoring tool (the FASILA score) would provide an accurate, simple, and easy-to-remember scoring system, offering superior outcomes compared to other prediction scores. FAST is a routine, primary adjuvant test to detect blood in the peritoneum in abdominal trauma. FAST positivity or negativity, and/or the number of positive regions, are well-known determinants of MT requirements [3, 8, 9, 23]. However, the accuracy of FAST depends on the technical skill of the operator and on patient-related factors including obesity.",

However, the existence of dozens of scoring models indicates their inadequacies and reflects the heterogeneous and contrasting approaches to decision-making in early trauma resuscitation [26]. We speculate, in addition to accuracy, simplicity of calculation (as in the FASILA score) is of prime importance for an ideal prediction score in early trauma resuscitation. The aim of the current study was to introduce and test the utility of this novel simple score (FASILA) using clinical and POC laboratory findings, to predict MT and mortality in patients with abdominal trauma, and to compare it with the other widely used scores.",

Furthermore, FASILA score was categorized into 7 points from 0 to 6, and the 7-point FASILA scales were analyzed and compared. Differences in categorical variables between the respective comparison groups were analyzed using either the Chi-square or Fisher\u2019s exact tests. Continuous variables were analyzed using either the Student\u2019s t or analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests.

The present study defined MT as the transfusion of 10 or more units of blood in the first 24 h, which is beset with limitations. Many authors have attempted to overcome the limitations of this definition including Savage et al. [42] that proposed instead the critical administration threshold (CAT). Regardless of the many limitations, 10 U/24 h still remains the most utilized definition for MT worldwide. We did not include severely injured patients who die or stop bleeding with less than 10 units of RBCs, but certainly qualify. We also do not have information on the hourly transfusion.",
