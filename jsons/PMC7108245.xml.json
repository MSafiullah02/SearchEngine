Although many travellers from the UK visit Europe and North America, there has been an increase in travel to tropical destinations. This places travellers at risk of a variety of travel-related conditions, such as malaria, dengue and other tropical or vaccine-preventable infections, many of which are rarely, if ever, encountered at home. Travellers are therefore an important group to target owing to their movement, the risk of adverse health outcomes abroad and the possibility of importation or exportation of infectious diseases.",

However, the most likely causes of mortality in travellers are accidental injury (e.g. road traffic accident (RTA), drowning) or a cardiovascular event, rather than an infectious disease, which accounts for only 1\u20132% of deaths.",

Caution is required for travellers who are severely immunosuppressed, for whom live vaccines are contraindicated and the efficacy of inactivated vaccines may be reduced. For travellers living with HIV, guidelines from the British HIV Association (www.bhiva.org/vaccination-guidelines.aspx) should be consulted. Live vaccines should generally be avoided, and must not be given to HIV-positive adults with CD4 cell counts <200 cells/microlitre. However, when travel is unavoidable, and risk of infection outweighs risk of vaccination, some live vaccines can be given to those who are asymptomatic with a stable CD4 count >200 cells/microlitre and a suppressed viral load.",
