            "text": "Influenza C virus (ICV) has been recognized as a cause of acute respiratory illness (ARI) in humans since 1947 [1]. However, since ICV is difficult to culture, the true burden of disease has remained unclear. Seroprevalence of ICV has been reported to be as high as 64% by 5 years of age, suggesting that many infections occur during early childhood [2], [3], [4], [5]. Recent RT-PCR studies suggest that ICV may be more commonly associated with ARI than previously thought [6], [7], [8]. However, ICV assays are not commercially available or widely tested in children. We sought to develop a new real-time RT-PCR assay for ICV based on all available sequence data. We then used the assay to test specimens collected during a study of Peruvian children with ARI.",

The assay was tested in multiple replicates against serial 10-fold dilutions of RNA transcripts.

Briefly, the study was conducted in the rural province of San Marcos in the Peruvian northern highlands. A dynamic cohort of \u223c500 children <3 years was followed from May 1, 2009 through September 30, 2011 through weekly active household-based ARI surveillance. ARI was defined as the presence of cough or fever, and an ARI was considered severe ARI/pneumonia if any sign or symptom of lower respiratory infection was present, including tachypnea, wheezing, nasal flaring, retractions, grunting, stridor, or cyanosis, or any general World Health Organization danger sign (inability to drink, lethargy, etc.) [13]. Newborns in study households were enrolled and children followed until their third birthday, loss to follow-up, withdrawal of consent, death, or end of study. Trained field workers visited the home of each enrolled child weekly to collect information on respiratory signs and symptoms over the preceding week with a standardized questionnaire and obtained a NS from any child with ARI. NS were also obtained from study children during asymptomatic periods. NS were placed in Remel M4RT\u00ae transport medium, transported on ice to the local research laboratory within 8 h, and frozen at \u221270 \u00b0C. RNA was extracted from thawed specimens with the MagMAX-96 Viral RNA Kit (Applied Biosystems). Specimens had been tested previously for influenza A/B, RSV, MPV, and PIV [14], [15], [16], [17], [18] while the ICV assay was under development. After the influenza C PCR assay was optimized and validated, the assay was performed on RNA extracts from specimens previously used to test for the other specified respiratory viruses. All specimens were tested by real-time RT-PCR for RNAse P to ensure RNA integrity and exclude PCR inhibition [19]. The study was approved by the IRBs at Vanderbilt University and the Instituto de Investigacion Nutricional.",

Lack of recognition of ICV infection seems to be attributable not only to difficulties in isolating the pathogen, but also to the mild symptoms associated with ICV compared to other influenza types. We report a new real-time RT-PCR assay for accurate detection of ICV. Although other RT-PCR assays for ICV have been previously described, those were usually developed based on a few sequences [6], [7], [8]. In contrast, we designed a novel NP4 ICV assay based on all available sequences in GenBank, including sequences from the original C/Taylor strain in 1947. Thus, the NP4 assay is likely to remain capable of detecting future circulating strains. We found that the NP gene is the most highly conserved ICV gene, and the new NP4 assay was able to detect diverse strains of ICV with high sensitivity and specificity.",

The 1% detection of ICV among children with ARI in our study is comparable to previous studies, outside of outbreak settings, where molecular diagnostic methods were used. In these settings ICV was typically detected in <1% of subjects with ARI, although those studies were not all restricted to pediatric populations, and some included assessments of hospitalized as well as outpatient subjects [23], [24], [25]. Most previous studies have reported that symptoms of ICV infection are mild with fever, cough, and rhinorrhea occurring most frequently [6], [23], [24], [25], [26]. Those results are similar to our findings from children followed through household surveillance. However, in another study from Japan, where respiratory tract specimens were collected from symptomatic children who visited one of four clinics or three hospitals from 1990 to 2004 (84,946 specimens), overlapping with a nationwide ICV epidemic in 2004 [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], 21/170 (12.3%) ICV detections were associated with pneumonia or bronchiolitis [24]. Another study of hospitalized children in Japan reported that ICV was detected in 10% of children hospitalized with lower respiratory tract illness, and these infections were associated with a similar proportion of pneumonia when compared to human metapneumovirus (MPV) infection [28]. These studies and others of hospitalized children [29] and children with pneumonia [30] suggest that while the typical clinical symptoms of ICV infection could be characterized as a common cold-like illness, complicated, lower respiratory tract infection requiring hospitalization may also occur [22], [23], [31].",

Some studies reported similar clinical features and severity associated with ICV and IAV [30]. However, similar to our findings, an earlier study found that fever was more common and the duration of fever was longer among children with IAV compared to ICV [24]. Another study of ICV among military recruits in Finland demonstrated a substantial difference in the proportion of fever with IAV (41%) compared to ICV (11%) [6]. Other groups have also found that co-detection with other viruses occurs more frequently with symptomatic ICV infection than with other influenza types, although co-detections were not associated with more severe symptoms [29], [31]. Additionally, we have demonstrated that ICV detection is rare among asymptomatic children, indicating that, when present, the virus likely contributes to the pathogenesis of respiratory illness [16].",

Ours is one of few reports of children with ARI followed via longitudinal, community, household-based surveillance, capturing a relatively milder spectrum of disease than other reports of pediatric ICV infections that study features of illness from among children that present or are admitted to health care facilities. Therefore, these findings expand our understanding of the spectrum of ICV disease. Our study is also subject to a few limitations. We did not test all published primer/probe sets, and some might have performed well despite nucleotide mismatches; furthermore, in silico analysis does not always predict in vitro performance. However, we included one assay that has been used in studies of ICV epidemiology as a comparator. All assays performed well, though with sequence-based modifications the performance on the NP4 assay was enhanced. Validation with specific instruments and kits is necessary for all molecular assays, and additional assessments of the assays in other settings would be helpful. Finally, ICV was frequently associated with detection of other respiratory viruses during ARI episodes. Clarifying the role of ICV as a causative agent of those illnesses is difficult and additional research is needed on this topic.",

The assay exhibited linear performance, detected viruses from diverse lineages over time, and enhanced detection of ICV in clinical specimens. We demonstrated ICV infections among young Peruvian children with ARI. These ICV infections were infrequently associated with lower respiratory tract illness in this household-based surveillance study. This new assay should be useful for future epidemiologic studies in diverse populations.",
