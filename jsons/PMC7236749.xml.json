On examination, he was guarded, internally preoccupied, called himself by an incorrect name, and thought he was being followed. When left alone momentarily, he fled and hid in a cabinet in the ED. He was unable to participate in bedside cognitive testing, but was fully oriented. There was no prior history of psychosis, but he had been seen two days prior at another local ED and sent home with a diagnosis of Panic Disorder. He had no respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms, no history of anosmia or ageusia and vital signs, CBC, CMP, CXR and Brain Computed Tomography (CT) scan were normal. Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, a measure of mortality risk in patients presenting to the ED, was 0, indicating minimal risk.14 Acute phase reactants were elevated: C-reactive protein (CRP) was 0.67 (0.0-0.5 mg/dl) and serum ferritin was 421 (180-370 mcg/l). Social history revealed several family members positive for COVID-19, all asymptomatic. The patient was tested in the ED and found to be COVID-positive. He was transferred to the medical service for supportive care and also received quetiapine 25 mg daily for 4 days. His psychotic agitation improved and he was discharged home with psychiatric follow-up.",

With the consulting psychiatrist, she was inattentive, pressured, agitated, disorganized and suspicious, perseverating on bizarre somatic sensations of \u201cfire burning up inside\u201d and migratory numbness and tingling, which family stated had never occurred previously. She was fully oriented but would not cooperate with bedside cognitive testing. She had no respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms, anosmia or ageusia, her CMP, CXR and Brain CT and all vital signs were normal. She had low WBC of 2.8 k/mm3. SOFA score was 0. She had no known COVID-19 exposure, but was tested and found to be COVID-positive. She was given lorazepam 1 mg and aripiprazole 2 mg in the ED with some acute improvement and was then admitted to the medical service for further evaluation and treatment. CRP was elevated, 1.89 mg/dl, while ferritin was normal. Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were prescribed to treat COVID infection and further antipsychotic medication was avoided out of concern for QTc prolongation. She continued on her outpatient medication fluoxetine 10 mg daily, while clonazepam 0.5 mg twice daily and melatonin 3 mg at bedtime were initiated. She was transferred voluntarily to our specialized psychiatric unit for COVID-positive patients due to ongoing anxiety and psychotic symptoms, where she continued to be physically asymptomatic, her antimicrobials were stopped and aripiprazole 5 mg daily was added to her regimen.",

These cases are strikingly similar to those described recently by Martin12 in the metropolitan Boston area who reported three cases of new onset paranoid psychosis related to the fear of COVID-19. While the presentation is similar, the patients we saw were not overtly expressing COVID-related concerns. Further, because of the new-onset presentation and our ability to obtain rapid COVID testing in addition to other medical work-up, they were able to be diagnosed COVID-positive, raising new differential diagnostic considerations.",

However, the lack of COVID preoccupation in these patients, the presence of COVID infection and elevated inflammatory markers, particularly CRP, raise the possibility of a virus-associated inflammatory trigger. Delirium must also be considered in the differential diagnosis of these patients. Psychotic symptoms can be observed in the context of delirium, and these patients had recent, sudden onset psychosis, and two of the three patients were disorganized and, while fully oriented, could not otherwise participate in bedside cognitive testing, all consistent with the diagnosis. However, the patients were not physically ill, had minimal laboratory derangement with the exception of inflammatory markers, and we did not observe characteristic fluctuations in level of alertness or in the psychotic symptoms, making the diagnosis less likely.",

The absence of brain computed tomography abnormalities is not unexpected in these cases and does not exclude CNS pathology that might be detected by more sensitive functional imaging studies such as Magnetic Resonance Diffusion Weighted Imaging and Spectroscopy, which can better detect white matter and inflammatory changes. Neuropsychological screening tools or fuller assessment as contact risk would allow could have elucidated concurrent cognitive abnormalities and contribute to differential diagnosis. Further, measurement of a broader array of cytokines, including CRP, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-8, IL-10 and IL-2R and others in peripheral blood and CSF (via lumbar puncture) would better characterize immune activation both peripherally and centrally. Measurement of COVID-19 RNA in CSF could indicate virological invasion into CNS. Finally, reliance on self-report and collateral history made it difficult to determine the precise nature and time course of onset of psychosis in relationship to acquisition of the infection. Nonetheless, the onset within just a few days prior to COVID diagnosis and the presence of concurrent immune activation, suggests psychosis may have similar onset to other types of COVID symptoms in the active stage of infection.",
