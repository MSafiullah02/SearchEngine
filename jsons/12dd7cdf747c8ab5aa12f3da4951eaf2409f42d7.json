However, procedures have been developed that account for asymptomatic HCV infections in estimating the total number of reported acute cases ( estimation procedures are discussed in Sect. 5.5 ).

While IDU is the most common mode of transmission in developed countries, additional risk factors, including exposure to unsafe blood products and injection practices, are highly prevalent and contribute to signifi cant HCV transmission in developing countries [ 37 ] . There are many international recommendations for hepatitis C testing and all have consistency in their recommendation for testing of persons who inject illicit drugs, prior recipients of transfusions or organ transplants, persons with persistently elevated liver enzymes, children born to HCV-infected mothers, and persons exposed to HCV-positive blood in healthcare [ 38 ] . Table 6 .2 describes the interpretation of hepatitis C test results and corresponding further actions. The initial test is for HCV antibodies, which are detectable approximately 4-10 weeks after exposure [ 39 ] . In symptomatic cases, this time period usually occurs at or before the onset of clinical symptoms. The HCV antibody test is positive in acute, chronic, and resolved infections ( Table 6. 2 ). Consequently, HCV antibody tests do not have the capacity to distinguish current infection from past, resolved infection [ 40 ] . In addition to standard serologic assays, there are also rapid tests to detect HCV antibodies [ 41 ] . The availability of standard and rapid assays varies signifi cantly and is dependent on availability of resources [ 40 ] . Over the past decade, new generations of standard tests with high sensitivity and specifi city have been developed [ 40 , 42 ] . However, the proportion of false-positive HCV antibody results is inversely related to the HCV prevalence in that setting [ 40 , 43 ] . False-negative HCV antibody results also occur, particularly in individuals with severe immunodefi ciency [ 39 , 44 ] , but rarely among the general population.",

Further, because these tests detect HCV RNA, they are important for differentiating current infection from past, resolved infection [ 45 ] .

In conditions where the HCV antibody test is likely a false negative, RNA testing may provide the correct diagnosis [ 43 ] . For these reasons, quantitative HCV RNA assays and genotype studies are important in the clinical management of chronic HCV infection. It is recommended before initiating antiviral therapy to retest for HCV RNA in a subsequent blood sample to confi rm HCV RNA positivity c If the person tested is suspected of having HCV exposure within the past 6 months, or has clinical evidence of HCV disease, or if there is concern regarding the handling or storage of the test specimen Other tests available for hepatitis C detection and diagnosis include the HCV core antigen test [ 46 ] and core antigen/antibody tests [ 47 ] .

Health offi cials quickly recruited and collected information from certain drug treatment facilities and implemented a surveillance project that provided results that were applied and published in less than a year [ 62 ] . In another study, researchers sought to determine which hepatitis C genotypes were circulating among injection drug users in Hungary [ 63 ] . They approached needle exchange programs and drug treatment facilities in all health districts and found that HCV strains among injection drug users were very different compared to HCV-infected persons who did not acquire their infections from injecting drugs [ 63 ] .

As a result, virtually all deaths are included in the registries. Cause of death listed on the death certifi cate is dependent on the presence/absence of a physician or family member who is knowledgeable about the health of the deceased, severity of disease, complexity of the disease, associated illnesses, and whether or not an autopsy or diagnostic laboratory testing was performed. Death certifi cates are completed by funeral directors based on information from attending physicians, medical examiners, coroners, and family members. Death certifi cates are fi led in vital statistics offi ces within each state and the District of Columbia. States share information from death certifi cates with CDC through the National Vital Statistics System, which then produces publicuse mortality fi les containing death information with cause of death coded in accordance with the International Classifi cation of Disease, Tenth Revision [ 70 ] . These data are used to determine the national burden of mortality associated with specifi c diseases, including viral hepatitis. A recent analyses of these mortality data from 1999 through 2007 indicated that the hepatitis C mortality rate exceeded the HIV mortality rate in 2007 [ 32 ] . (b) Surveys : Health surveys are used for a variety of reasons, including augmenting our understanding of viral hepatitis from surveillance. Currently, the CDC uses several national surveys, which may include seroprevalence data, to describe and understand hepatitis C-related prevalence, hospitalizations, treatments, and development of CLD. For example, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) has provided valuable seroprevalence data on hepatitis A [ 71 ] , hepatitis B [ 72 ] , and hepatitis C [ 12 ] that are representative of the US noninstitutionalized civilian population [ 73 ] . The National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey use a national sample of visits from nonfederal employed offi ce-based physicians who provide direct patient care and from emergency departments and outpatient department of noninstitutional general and short-stay hospitals, respectively, to obtain information about the use and provision of ambulatory medical care services, including viral hepatitis-related visits [ 74 ] , in these settings. The National Hospital Discharge Survey was a nationally representative survey conducted from 1965-2010 that provided information from patients of non-federal, short-stay hospitals in the USA about the characteristics of these patients, conditions for which they were treated, cost of treatment, and a number of other public health topics of interest. The National Hospital Care Survey is a new survey which links the inpatient data that was collected by the National Hospital Discharge Survey with the emergency department, outpatient department, and ambulatory surgery center data collected by the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. Together, these population-based surveys provide a wealth of readily available data that are already in electronic format. As a result, they can be relatively inexpensive sources of useful information in addition to that obtained from surveillance.",

The 2012 hepatitis C surveillance case defi nitions require a combination of symptoms and laboratory fi ndings for acute disease and laboratory fi ndings only for past/present hepatitis C [ 9 ] . Because the clinical characteristics are the same for acute hepatitis A, B, and C, laboratory testing is needed to identify the specifi c viral cause of illness. For both acute and past/present hepatitis C cases, laboratory fi ndings include a positive antibody to hepatitis C virus screening test, nucleic acid test for HCV RNA, and genotype testing. A special defi nition is applied to identify new seroconversions that require only one positive test and a previous negative test within the past 6 months [ 9 ] . In 2012, the European Union decided not to require clinical signs/symptoms for a confi rmed case. Instead, at least one laboratory fi nding (RNA, core antigen, or antibody) in a person aged >18 months represents a confi rmed case. The defi nition classifi es an acute hepatitis C case as one that has a seroconversion within 12 months or has detected either RNA or core antigen but is antibody negative. A chronic case is defi ned as two samples positive for RNA or core antigen detected at least 12 months apart [ 76 ] . In Australia, case reports supplement other sources of information on HCV infection. A confi rmed case in Australia requires laboratory evidence of either an antibody or nucleic acid test (either genotype or RNA) in a person aged at least 24 months, and who does not meet the criteria for a newly acquired case; that is, there is no evidence that the infection was acquired in the 24 months before diagnosis [ 77 ] .",

After checking the surveillance database to determine whether the potential case was previously reported and had other epidemiologic or laboratory information, health departments can either attempt follow-up investigation or wait for future laboratory information to be received. Follow-up might require contacting the case patient's provider to determine whether symptoms of hepatitis were present. Together with information that the case was not previously reported suggests a newly reported acute hepatitis C case. Follow-up with the case patient and/or the healthcare provider is required to obtain additional epidemiologic data. Cases might be divided into groups of interest, such as persons aged <30 years that may indicate IDU [ 78 ] or adults aged >65 years that may indicate transmission in healthcare and extended care facilities. Prioritizing groups of interest reduces the number of cases to be investigated, which makes the task more achievable.

At the local level, surveillance data are used to identify the most likely mode of transmission in the community to limit further transmission, detect and control local outbreaks, improve outreach services, and provide appropriate case management including screening and linking infected persons into care and counseling. Additionally, hepatitis C surveillance data can be matched with other disease registries, such as HIV, in order to integrate medical services for each individual and further understand disease burden. Surveillance data can also be used to evaluate the quality of care, including implementation of hepatitis A and B vaccine recommendations, among HCV-infected patients.

In the USA, CDC estimates that for every reported case of acute hepatitis C, another 12 infections go unreported [ 80 ] . There are many reasons why hepatitis C is underreported in the USA. First, HCV infections can only be considered acute if symptoms are present or there is a documented seroconversion. However, 70-85 % of HCV-infected individuals are asymptomatic; about one-half are unaware of their infection [ 84 ] . Second, a large percentage of HCV-infected persons may lack access to healthcare services and are thus not reported to health departments. In addition, many states lack the funding needed to conduct enhanced surveillance and do not have the capacity to develop a surveillance system capable of receiving and processing the large number of positive HCV antibody laboratory reports. The number of hepatitis C cases annually reported to health departments often outpaces the amount of resources on hand to fully conduct follow-up investigations to determine if the newly reported case is acute. For these reasons, identifying hepatitis C cases is challenging.",

The inability to depend solely on serologic testing to identify acute hepatitis C cases combined with the inability to fully investigate all newly reported cases often leads to the inability to determine if hepatitis C cases are confi rmed; these cases instead have a case status label of \"probable,\" \"suspect,\" or \"unknown.\" Unconfi rmed cases may never be tested or investigated to determine if they are currently infected [ 85 ] .

However, careful consideration of objectives should be balanced with available resources. The current US hepatitis C surveillance system forms the backbone of surveillance and provides incidence data. Enhanced surveillance activities provide additional risk and exposure information on cases. To describe the complete spectrum of HCV disease, HCV-related information from additional sources of data, including population-based surveys, is used. As healthcare services evolve in their application of informatics, surveillance of HCV infection can take advantage of the events generated from HCV-related medical encounters in electronic medical records. Testing data from laboratories could be used to monitor the implementation of screening recommendations, and results from nucleic acid tests could be useful to distinguish between current present and resolved or past HCV infection.",
