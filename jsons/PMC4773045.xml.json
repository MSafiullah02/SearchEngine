On May 20, a 68-year-old man returning to the Republic of Korea from a trip to Saudi Arabia was diagnosed with MERS-CoV infection, and since then, the virus has spread, resulting in a cluster of 145 MERS-CoV cases, including 14 deaths, in South Korea and China (http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/en/), bringing the total number of countries reporting MERS-CoV infection to 25. This patient became the one of the most active \u201cMERS super-spreader\u201d, while the MERS super-spreader in Abu Dhabi was linked to 28 confirmed MERS cases (http://www.recombinomics.com/News/04291401/UAE_MERS_Superspreader_28.html).",

This is yet another alarm sounding the necessity for the rapid development of therapeutic and prophylactic agents to treat MERS patients and protect high-risk populations from MERS-CoV until an effective and safe vaccine is available.1,2",

We found that HR2P could bind with the HR1 domain to form a stable six-helix bundle and thus inhibit viral fusion core formation and S protein-mediated cell-cell fusion. HR2P was demonstrated to potently inhibit infection by both pseudotyped and live MERS-CoV in different cell lines.5 We then modified the HR2P peptide by introducing Glu (E) and Lys (K) residues at the i to i+4 or i to i+3 arrangements. We found that one of these HR2P analogous peptides, HR2P-M2, exhibited significantly improved stability, solubility and antiviral activity.5",

We further demonstrated that the HR2P-M2 peptide administered via the intranasal route could protect Ad5-hDPP4-transduced mice6 from challenge by MERS-CoV strains with or without mutations in the HR1 region, indicating that this peptide could be used as a nasal spray to protect high-risk populations, including healthcare workers, MERS patients' family members, and those having close contacts with the patients, from MERS-CoV infection.7 Intranasal application of the peptide to MERS-CoV-infected patients may suppress viral replication in epithelial cells of the respiratory tract and thus reduce the release of virions, thereby preventing the spreading of MERS-CoV to other people.",

These mAbs, including m336,8 MERS-4,9 3B11,10 and Mersmab1,11 have shown potent neutralizing activity against MERS-CoV. The human mAb m336, which was derived from a very large naive antibody library, belongs to the IgG1 subclass, with high avidity (99 pM) and neutralizing activity against pseudotyped and authentic MERS-CoV (the half maximal inhibitory concentration of 0.033 and 0.47 nM, respectively).12 More interestingly, the m336 mAb is a germline-like antibody with only one mutation in the heavy chain and five in the light chain. As such, it is safe for humans, highly expressible, and highly soluble. In vivo studies have shown that this mAb is very effective in protecting MERS-CoV-susceptible animals from viral challenge (unpublished data), suggesting that the m336m mAb is a very promising drug candidate for the urgent treatment of MERS-CoV-infected patients.12",
