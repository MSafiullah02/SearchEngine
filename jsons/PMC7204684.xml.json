Past medical history was remarkable for non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation and bipolar disorder. Laboratory results on admission showed leukocytosis of 11.4 10^9/l and C-reactive protein (CRP) of 100mg/l. Arterial blood gas analysis on ambient air revealed a pO2 of 7.72 kPa and pCO2 of 8.24 kPa. Chest X-ray displayed infiltrates in the left upper and lower lobe. Nasopharyngeal swab resulted in a positive PCR for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The patient was hospitalized and treated symptomatically. On day 3 of hospitalization, fever resolved while CRP was undulating. The patients' general state of health improved significantly during the following 2 weeks and oxygen saturation was 95%. On March 24th she was discharged after SARS-CoV-2-PCR had been tested negative by nasopharyngeal swab the day before.",

According to the family physician, symptoms had developed anew/newly (?) and gradually over the previous 4-5 days. On admission, laboratory results showed a CRP of 175 mg/L, creatinine of 118 \u00b5mol/L and sodium of 167 mmol/L. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest revealed infiltrates in the right upper lobe as well as bilateral pleural effusion. After discussion with the family physician further escalation of treatment was omitted. The patient died on April 22nd.",

In the course of hospitalization, she developed cough and fever and was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR from a nasopharyngeal swab. CT of the chest performed on March 28th was normal. Concerning COVID-19, the clinical course of disease was unremarkable and the patient was transferred to our hospital on April 1st. On admission, she was afebrile and hemodynamically stable. Laboratory results showed CRP of 13 mg/l and LDH of 685 U/l. Fever and respiratory symptoms had resolved. Nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 were taken serially on April 2nd and 3rd resulting in negative PCRs and the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation facility on April 8th.",

Re-infection appears unlikely since COVID-19 infection rates were low in the region of our hospital and the trend of new infections declining at the time the patients were treated. These cases underline that caution should be exercised especially in vulnerable patient populations even after they appear to have overcome the infection. Close monitoring on an outpatient basis appears crucial.",
