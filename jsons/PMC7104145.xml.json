This disease is characterized by respiratory signs and in young chickens severe respiratory distress commonly occurs while in layers it causes decrease in egg production [1]. Until recently, the chicken was considered the only natural host of IBV and in which the virus cause disease. Pheasants are the other avian species that is now considered as a second natural host for IBV [2]. The disease is transmitted by the air-borne route, direct chicken to chicken contact and indirectly through mechanical spread [3].",
