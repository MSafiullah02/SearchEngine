However, in the case of the elderly or of individuals suffering from some diseases of the respiratory or circulatory system, there is less tolerance of the mild hypoxia at even this altitude. In an ideal world, the cabin would be pressurized to maintain sea level conditions. To achieve this would require an extremely strong and heavy aircraft structure with severe implications on load carrying capacity, fuel consumption and resulting effects on the external environment. As a result, a compromise has to be struck, and airworthiness regulations (US Federal Aviation Regulations and European Joint Aviation Requirements) state that \u2018pressurized cabins and compartments to be occupied must be equipped to provide a cabin pressure altitude of not more than 8000 ft (2500 m) at the maximum operating altitude of the aeroplane under normal operating conditions.\u20192\n",

            "text": "As a result of the required cabin pressure change during climb and descent, it is possible for individuals to suffer discomfort as a result of expansion of gas trapped within the body. In particular, gas can be trapped within the gut and within the middle ear and sinuses. Normally, this trapped gas is able to escape without any problem, but there may be occasions when this is not so, such as when the individual is suffering from upper respiratory tract congestion due to infection or allergy. In particular, the human ear is very sensitive to rates of pressure change, the threshold for detection being 0.132 PSI (0.910 kPa). This is equivalent to a change in cabin altitude of 250 ft (76 m) at sea level. In the human ear, the cavity of the middle ear is separated from the outer ear by the tympanic membrane. It communicates with the nasopharynx and, in turn, the atmosphere by way of the eustachian tube, the proximal two-thirds of which has soft walls that are normally collapsed. During ascent to altitude, the gas in the middle ear cavity expands and escapes along the eustachian tube into the nasopharynx, equalizing the pressure across the tympanic membrane. The pharyngeal portion of the eustachian tube acts as a one-way valve, thus allowing expanding air to escape easily to the atmosphere. This can be sometimes felt as a \u2018popping\u2019 sensation as air escapes from the tube during ascent.",

In some individuals, the one-way valve mechanism of the eustachian tube can prevent passive flow of air back into the middle ear cavity. This causes a relative increase of pressure on the outside of the tympanic membrane, pushing it into the middle ear cavity and causing a sensation of fullness, a decrease in hearing acuity and eventually pain. It is possible to perform active maneuvers to open the eustachian tube, such as swallowing, yawning, and jaw movements. In some people, these simple maneuvers are not effective and it may be necessary to occlude the nostrils and raise the pressure in the mouth and nose to force air into the middle ear cavities. This increase in pressure can usually simply be achieved by raising the floor of the mouth with the glottis shut, while other individuals raise the pressure in the lungs and the respiratory tract by contracting the expiratory muscles while forcibly exhaling (Valsalva's maneuver).",

            "text": "In addition to regulating the airflow rate required to pressurize the aircraft, the environmental control system controls the flow rate of outside air required to remove contaminants and controls the temperature in the cabin. This requirement is facilitated by the practice of recirculation of approximately 50% of the cabin air. This is achieved by extracting air from the cabin and mixing it with conditioned outside air. Recirculation provides two benefits: one, it allows the total airflow rate to be higher than the flow rate of the outside air, so good circulation in the cabin can be maintained independently of the outside airflow; and two, the conditioned air is mixed with comparatively warm recirculated air before being introduced into the cabin. As a result, the conditioned air is supplied at a much lower temperature without causing discomfort from cold drafts. The recirculated air will also have picked up moisture from the cabin occupants and the cabin activities, improving the humidity level. In older generation jet aircraft, all the air supplied to the cabin came from outside air, without the benefits of recirculation (improved humidity, reduction in perceived drafts). This practice was inefficient with a substantial energy, and hence environmental, cost.",

They are effective in removing bacteria and viruses from the recirculated air, so preventing their spread through the cabin by this route.

High humidity can lead to passenger and crew discomfort when it is accompanied by high temperature.

From 1996 to 2000, 63 of the 207 cases of imported measles into the USA developed a rash directly before or on the day of air travel. From these imported cases, only one documented case of in-flight transmission was reported.32 Despite the risk, few cases of measles occur as a direct result of in-flight exposure.32., 33. Amornkul and colleagues investigated the extent of measles transmission aboard an international commercial flight after exposure to an infected passenger.32 Of the 276 potentially exposed passengers, 82% completed a follow-up questionnaire, including 29 passengers who reported close contact with the ill passenger before, during, or after the flight.

From investigations of disease outbreaks associated with air travel, two main risk factors for the spread of communicable diseases have been identified: flight duration (>8 h, including ground time) and seating proximity to the source. There is no evidence that the pressurized cabin itself makes transmission of disease any more likely. Once the aircraft doors are closed, air-conditioning is provided from the auxiliary power unit until it can be supplied from the aircraft engines, thus ensuring the filtration benefits of air recirculation. There does appear to be increased risk of disease spread when the aircraft ventilation system is inoperable.",

Because of their frequent international travel, flight crews should receive health recommendations that are specifically geared to their travel patterns, itineraries, and lifestyles. For example, an international pilot flying frequently to sub-Saharan Africa would do well not to take routine anti-malarial medication, but should take precautions to avoid insect bites, may carry a self-treatment regimen if desired and if the layovers are extended, and should be instructed to seek medical attention immediately if a fever occurs.
