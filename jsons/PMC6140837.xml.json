As such, attention has been given to nutritional intervention strategies to improve the health, well-being, and performance of pigs. Recently, one strategy has involved increasing dietary soybean meal (SBM), and thus reducing crystalline AA use, which has been touted to promote more rapid disease resolution and improve growth performance and feed efficiency during viral pathogen challenges (Boyd et al., 2010; Rochell et al., 2015). However, the mode of action by which these beneficial SBM effects may occur are poorly defined and may involve nutrient digestibility (Schweer et al., 2017) or bioactive compounds associated with SBM (Greiner et al., 2001a,b).",

Even so, limited studies have determined the BEL of AA due to a pathogen or vaccine challenge in pigs or other livestock species. In nursery and growing pigs, Salmonella Typhimurium increased BEL of several AA (Lee, 2012). In contrast, use of a mild coccidial vaccine in broilers reduced BEL of several AA (Adedokun et al., 2012). Therefore, the objectives of this study were to determine how PRRSV infection affects the digestibility of nutrients and energy in high and low SBM diets and to determine BEL of AA in response to PRRSV infection in growing pigs.",

After surgery, pigs were moved to individual pens (1.8 \u00d7 1.9 m) and allowed to recover for 10 to 14 d.

Dietary treatments included a high SBM (HSBM, 29.7% SBM; n = 6 pigs/challenge status) and low SBM (LSBM, 10.0% SBM; n = 6 pigs/challenge status) diet (Table 1) that met or exceeded requirements for nutrients and energy (NRC, 2012). The 29.72% SBM was chosen and considered high because this inclusion rate met all the essential AA requirements without the addition of crystalline AA for this size pig. Furthermore, going beyond this inclusion rate of SBM would promote excess N excretion and wastage. Soybean meal inclusion was limited to 10% in the LSBM diet and supplemented with l-Lys\u00b7HCl. Diets were formulated to be isocaloric (ME basis) and contain similar SID Lys concentrations (Table 1). At inoculation, a subset of pigs (n = 8 pigs/challenge status) were allotted to an NF diet (Table 1) to determine BEL associated with PRRSV. All diets contained 0.40% chromic oxide as an indigestible marker. Pigs were allotted to diets based on BW, and diets were fed starting postsurgery. Pigs on the HSBM and LSBM diets were fed the same diet for the duration of the experiment. The NF diet was fed at 0 to 8 and 12 to 19 dpi (4- to 5-d diet adaptation followed by a 4-d collection).

Briefly, all samples were analyzed for DM (method 930.15; AOAC, 2007), chromic oxide as described by Fenton and Fenton (1979), N using TruMac N (Leco Corporation, St. Joseph, MO), and GE using bomb calorimetry (Oxygen Bomb Calorimeter 6200, Parr Instruments, Moline, IL). Amino acid composition of diet and digesta samples was determined by the Agricultural Experiment Station Chemical Laboratories at the University of Missouri\u2013Columbia (Columbia, MO) by cation-exchange HPLC (L8900 Amino Acid Analyzer, Hitachi High-Technologies Corporation, Tokyo, Japan).",

In the current study, all PRRSV-infected pigs, including PRRSV-inoculated NF pigs, demonstrated a classical PRRS viremia and antibody (seroconversion) response based on the timing of viremia (by 7 to 14 dpi) and seroconversion (14 to 21 dpi).

Apparent total tract digestibility of DM, N, and GE was assessed from dpi 5 to 6 (Table 4) and dpi 16 to 17 (Table 5) by fecal grab sample. There was no diet \u00d7 PRRSV interaction (P > 0.10) at either time point or any effect of PRRSV on any ATTD coefficients evaluated. No effect of PRRSV on ATTD coefficients is in agreement with a previous study from our group (Schweer et al., 2016b); however, this is in contrast with another study from our group (Schweer et al., 2017). In the later study, pigs were housed in a commercial barn and not in a BSL2 facility, and could have been exposed to secondary pathogens. Together, this would have had a higher immunological burden that would have contributed to the reduction in ATTD coefficients reported in this field study. Expectedly, there was an effect of diet at both time points postinoculation where ATTD of N was reduced in LSBM compared with HSBM (P < 0.01). This is in agreement with previous reports demonstrating that as dietary CP decreases, so does N digestibility (Yu et al., 2017). Also, at 5 to 6 dpi, ATTD of GE was reduced in the LSBM diet compared to HSBM (P < 0.01). This is in contrast with previous studies that reported no difference between high protein and low protein, AA-supplemented diets on energy digestibility (Kerr and Easter, 1995); however, these pigs were younger and not housed in BSL2 facilities.",

The previous study, however, utilized younger pigs and a different, less virulent PRRSV isolate. Similarly, when pigs were challenged with lipopolysaccharide to elicit immune system stimulation, no AID differences were reported (Rakhshandeh et al., 2010). After 24 h of Salmonella Typhimurium infection, only AID of Gly was reduced, and at 72 h after infection, AID of Lys, Phe, Thr, and Ser were reduced (Lee, 2012), suggesting that health challenge or immune stimulation has little impact on AID coefficients.",

            "text": "One of the primary objectives of this paper was to determine if a PRRSV challenge altered BEL of N and AA in grower pigs. Surprisingly, BEL of N and AA are very poorly understood and defined across health compromised livestock species. In a limited number of studies, endogenous secretions are altered due to the enteric challenges Salmonella Typhimurium (Lee, 2012) and Brachyspira hyodysenteriae (Wilberts et al., 2014; Quintana-Hayashi et al., 2015), but in general, they are not well characterized. Basal endogenous loss of AA and N in healthy control pigs and pigs infected with PRRSV at 7 to 8 dpi and 18 to 19 dpi were determined using the NF method (Table 6). At 7 to 8 dpi, significant reductions (P \u2264 0.05) in BEL of Arg, Ala, and Pro were detected, with no other differences noted (P > 0.10). Interestingly, BEL of N tended (P = 0.087) to be reduced in PRRS pigs; however, total tract basal N losses were increased in PRRS pigs (3.44 vs. 2.50 g/kg DMI, P < 0.001). At 18 to 19 dpi, there was a strong tendency (P = 0.057) for BEL of Thr to be increased. There were also numerical reductions in BEL of Arg, Ala, and Pro during this collection period, but because of high variability, significance was not detected. This high variability could be a result of variance associated with host\u2013pathogen interactions, pathogen virulence and clearance rates, or small sample size. Similarly, ileal and total tract basal N losses were not different at 18 to 19 dpi.",

This could suggest that infected pigs require more Ala and Pro than noninfected pigs. Collagen is abundant in the lungs, forming the bronchovascular skeleton and is also found in the lining of basal membranes, and is rich in Ala, Pro, and hydroxyproline (Eyre and Muir, 1975). Girard et al. (2001) reported that PRRSV increases collagenase activity in the lung at 7 and 14 dpi, which could increase the need for Ala and Pro. Basal endogenous loss of Arg was also reduced due to PRRSV. Arginine can be readily converted to Glu, a preferred energy substrate of activated immune cells (Maciolek et al., 2014), or Pro which is involved in collagen synthesis, as previously mentioned. Nitric oxide (NO), a derivative of Arg, exhibits antiviral activity; however, there are contrasting reports on the ability of NO to inhibit PRRSV replication (Pampusch et al., 1998; Jung et al., 2010; Yan et al., 2017). This could be a result of insufficient Arg causing NO inhibition, which leads to increased reactive oxygen species and ultimately apoptosis (Lee and Kleiboeker, 2007).",

Digestive enzyme secretion could also be reduced, and although this requires further exploration, we have seen no reduction in sucrase, maltase, or aminopeptidase activities in the jejunum of PRRSV-infected nursery pigs (Schweer et al., 2016a). Differences in total tract endogenous N loss could likely be related to microbial density and activity in the cecum and colon. Total microbial diversity can be reduced, while proteolytic species (e.g., Proteobacteria) can increase in pigs severely impacted by PRRSV challenge (Niederwerder et al., 2016). Similarly, increased microbial diversity and density in the gut can reduce coughing, lung lesion scores, and respiratory cytokines during Mycoplasma hyopneumoiniae challenge (Schachtschneider et al., 2013). Changes in pig gut microbial density or diversity have not been described in other viral respiratory challenges.",

In the current study, SID values were determined from AID values through the use of an NF diet and determination of BEL. As previously mentioned, BEL of some AA can be overestimated using an NF diet. Therefore, it is possible that some SID values can be overestimated. Proline determination can be variable; even so, there was a tendency for interaction in the current study. Decreased SID of Arg and Pro due to PRRSV infection are likely due to the decreased BEL of each of these AA. In a repeated lipopolysaccharide injection model, Rakhshandeh et al. (2014) reported no difference in SID of Met and Cys; however, SID values were calculated from BEL values described by Jansman et al. (2002). To the author\u2019s knowledge, there are only 2 studies that report both BEL and SID values in pigs utilizing a Salmonella Typhimurium challenge model in nursery and grower pigs. In nursery pigs, Lee (2012) used a comparative slaughter technique and reported a tendency for SID of Arg to be reduced at 24- and 72-h postchallenge. In the same study, and in contrast to the current study, SID of Gly was increased by more than 2-fold at 24 h but was not different at 72-h postchallenge. No differences in Pro, Ala, or Ser were reported in the study. Using the T-cannula method, SID of all AA were significantly reduced or tended to be reduced between 8 and 24 h after inoculation in growing pigs; however, by 56-h postinoculation SID values had recovered to preinoculation values (Lee, 2012). In the same study, the greatest reduction was seen in Gly (53% reduction), which is in agreement with the current study, but contrasts the previous study by Lee, which utilized younger pigs. As Salmonella Typhimurium is a bacterial pathogen that impacts the intestinal tract, it likely has a different impact than a respiratory virus like PRRSV, probably leading to differences in the 2 studies.",

Zhai and Adeola (2011) reported a negative linear relationship between the digestibility of several AA and dietary CP, with SID of AA decreasing as CP increased.

Increased disappearance of nutrients and energy in the hindgut of pigs fed HSBM diets was likely due to the increased CP content in the diet, and therefore, increased protein reaching the cecum and colon promoting microbial growth.

Surprisingly, no differences (P > 0.10) were detected at 5 to 8 dpi or 16 to 19 dpi. A numerical increase in DM disappearance at both collection periods (62% and 55%, respectively) was seen in PRRSV pigs compared with control pigs; however, due to high variation, no significance was detected. A potential increase in DM disappearance coupled with increased total tract endogenous N loss could be a result of increased microbial activity and/or abundance. In pigs fed protein-free diets, fecal and microbial protein composition is similar (Taverner et al., 1981), probably indicating an increase in microbial abundance in the hindgut of PRRSV pigs, which can have a beneficial outcome (Niederwerder et al., 2016).",

            "text": "Diet is known to impact AID and SID of AA. Crystalline AA are assumed to be 100% digestible, so when a diet is supplemented with crystalline AA, digestibility increases as demonstrated in the current study. Similarly, as dietary AA content decreases, AID and SID increase (Otto et al., 2003). Diet also can alter the microbial profile in the gut leading to changes in hindgut disappearance of nutrients. Health challenges are known to impact AID, but studies to determine SID values are scarce. Digestibility of AA during stress appears to be dependent on the stage of disease. After 24 h of Salmonella Typhimurium, AID of AA were minimally impacted while after 72 h, AID of Lys, Phe, Thr, and Ser were reduced (Lee, 2012). Interestingly, SID of His and Gly were increased at 24 h and SID of Lys was reduced at 72 h. In the current study, only SID of Arg, Gly, and Pro at 7 to 8 dpi and SID of Pro at 18 to 19 dpi were reduced. Similarly, environmental stress and pathogens impact BEL of AA where it has been shown that heat stressing pigs for 2 d resulted in increased BEL of Arg and His. After 8 d of adaptation to heat stress, BEL of total nonessential AA and Pro increased by 16% and 54%, respectively. In contrast, nursery or grower pigs challenged with Salmonella Typhimurium demonstrated increased BEL of all AA within 24 h but were not different after 56 h (Lee, 2012). In the current study, PRRSV reduced BEL of Arg, Ala, and Pro at 7 to 8 dpi only. Although oppositely affected, BEL differences were detected around peak disease in these studies and were not different during the recovery phase.",

Also, PRRSV has little impact on digestibility. In contrast to other challenge models, BEL of some AA were reduced at peak viremia and were not different during seroconversion, although there is high variability associated with the determination of these values. In conclusion, SBM inclusion impacts SID of AA and hindgut disappearance of nutrients, regardless of PRRSV. Furthermore, there was minimal impact of PRRSV on BEL, and therefore, SID of most AA were not different.",
