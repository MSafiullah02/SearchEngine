The World Health Organization (WHO) declared that COVID-19 has become a global health concern, causing severe respiratory tract infections in humans. Current evidence indicates that SARS-CoV-2 spread to humans via transmission from wild animals illegally sold in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. Phylogenetic analysis shows that SARS-CoV-2 is a new member of the Coronaviridae family but is distinct from SARS-CoV (identity of approximately 79%) and MERS-CoV (identity of approximately 50%) [1,2]. Knowing the origin of such a pathogen is critical to developing the means to block further transmission and vaccines [3]. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 shares a high level of genetic similarity (96.3%) with the bat coronavirus RaTG13, which was obtained from bats in Yunnan in 2013; however, bats are not the immediate source of SARS-CoV-2 [4].",

In China during the outbreak of the pandemic, 42 000 doctors and nurses from all over the country supported Wuhan. Moreover, the government shared the updated genome sequence of COVID-19 to the public, and scientists from China and overseas are working closely and efficiently on this public health emergency [5,6]. Due to interventions and control measures from the government (shutting down public transportation and implementing a treatment strategy) and the change in personal behaviors (wearing masks and reducing contact with others), the number of confirmed and suspected cases in China has started to decrease.",

The early outbreak data largely follow exponential growth. Different models based on the clinical progression of the disease were devised to estimate the basic reproduction number. In the early stages of COVID-19, the pandemic doubled in size every 7.4 days, and the basic reproduction number was estimated to be 2.2 [7]. Another study estimated the basic reproduction number as ranging from 2.24 to 3.58 [11]. However, a deterministic compartmental model based on the likelihood and a model analysis showed that the control reproduction number may be as high as 6.47 [12]. The authors noted that this basic reproduction number was higher because the estimate accounts for 3-4 generations of viral transmission and intensive social contacts. The basic reproduction number estimated by the majority of studies ranges from 2.24 to 3.58 [13], which is slightly higher than that of SARS.",

            "text": "Rapid and accurate detection of COVID-19 is crucial to control outbreaks in the community and in hospitals [14]. Current diagnostic tests for coronavirus include reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), real\u2010time RT-PCR (rRT\u2010PCR), and reverse transcription loop\u2010mediated isothermal amplification (RT\u2010LAMP) [15,16]. RT-LAMP has similar sensitivity to rRT-PCR, is highly specific and is used to detect MERS-CoV [17,18]. According to current diagnostic criteria founded by the China National Health Commission, laboratory examinations, including nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab tests, have become a standard assessment for diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. To identify patients earlier, two one-step quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) assays were developed to detect two different regions (ORF1b and N) of the SARS-CoV-2 genome [19]. Three novel RT-PCR assays targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)/helicase (Hel), spike (S), and nucleocapsid (N) genes of SARS-CoV-2 were developed. Among the three novel assays, the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay had the lowest limit of detection in vitro; highly sensitive and specific assays may help to improve the laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19 [20]. The SARS-CoV E gene assay was more sensitive than the RdRp gene assay combined with the one-step RT-PCR system [21]. The E gene PCR was sufficient to diagnose a SARS-CoV-2 infection but the RdRp protocol was recommended to confirm a positive result [22,23]. The overall positive rate of RT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 4880 cases from one hospital in Wuhan was 38% [24]. The positive rate of PCR for oropharyngeal swabs is not very high: only 53.3% of COVID-19-confirmed patients had positive oral swabs tests [25]. In a series of 51 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection, 71% patients were RT-PCR positive at the first time of testing of throat swab or sputum samples [26]. The RT-PCR results usually become positive after several days (2-8 days) [27]. Automated solutions for molecular diagnostics can handle large numbers of samples and can be scaled to keep pace with fluctuating demand [28], [29], [30]. The good analytical performance of a molecular assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 on a high-throughput platform, the cobas 6800, was observed with minimal hands-on time, while offering fast and reliable results [31,32].",

For patients suffering from fever, sore throat, fatigue, coughing or dyspnea that is coupled with recent exposure, COVID-19 infection should be diagnosed with typical chest computerized tomography (CT) characteristics despite negative RT-PCR results [33]. Of 1014 patients, 59% had positive RT-PCR results, and 88% had positive chest CT scans [34]. COVID-19 belongs to the Coronaviridae family; therefore, it is not surprising that COVID-19 has imaging findings that are similar to those for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [35]. Typical CT findings included bilateral pulmonary parenchymal ground-glass and consolidative pulmonary opacities, sometimes with a rounded morphology and peripheral lung distribution [33]. Eighty-six percent of patients showed ground-glass opacities or consolidation, and more than one lobe (71%) with bilateral involvement (76%) was affected in the 21 initial chest CT scans [36]. Notably, lung cavitation, discrete pulmonary nodules, pleural effusions, and lymphadenopathy were absent [36]. Lung abnormalities on chest CT scan were most severe approximately 10 days after the initial onset of symptoms [37]. Chest CT scans can be used to assess the severity of COVID-19. COVID-19 also manifests with chest CT imaging abnormalities in asymptomatic patients, with rapid evolution from focal unilateral to diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities that progressed to or co-existed with consolidations within 1-3 weeks. Combining assessment of imaging features with clinical and laboratory findings could facilitate early diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia [38], [39], [40]. As the diagnostic criteria expanded from laboratory examination to chest CT imaging, more than 14 000 patients were diagnosed on February 12, 2020.",

All the residents living in mainland China were locked-in, and city public transportation, including buses, trains, ferries, and airports, were shutdown. Given the trajectory of this outbreak, the Chinese government scaled up such efforts to keep pace with the rapid increase in cases and geographical spread. The Wuhan government made full use of the gym and two convention centers and transformed them into makeshift hospitals with 3400 beds in only one night to isolate COVID-19 patients from healthy controls. More makeshift hospitals are under construction. Isolation beds were quickly expanded from only 137 at the beginning of the outbreak of COVID-19 to 56 000 to separate infected patients from non-infected individuals. The swift and decisive response of China contributed to reducing the control reproduction number and transmission risk. Due to the powerful and effective isolation measures taken by the Chinese government, the increase in COVID-19 began to slow down on February 14, 2020, according to the data released by the China National Health Commission.",

A retrospective, matched-cohort study including 1052 SARS patients showed that LPV/ritonavir as initial treatment was associated with a reduced death rate (2.3% vs. 11.0%) [43]. The protease inhibitor LPV is an effective treatment based on the experience accumulated from the SARS and MERS outbreaks, indicating it is a potential treatment option for COVID\u201019 [44]. Ribavirin, a guanosine analogue, is an antiviral compound used to treat several virus infections, including respiratory syncytial virus, hepatitis C virus, and some viral hemorrhagic fevers. Promising results were obtained with ribavirin in a MERS-CoV rhesus macaque model [45]. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) model is targeted by ribavirin after sequence analysis, modeling, and docking to build the model. This feature increases its potential as an antiviral against SARS-CoV-2 [46].",

Remdesivir shows broad-spectrum antiviral activity against several RNA viruses, and it may compete for RdRp [48]. Remdesivir and IFNb have superior antiviral activity to LPV and ritonavir in vitro [49]. In a mouse model of SARS-CoV pathogenesis, both prophylactic and therapeutic remdesivir improved pulmonary function and reduced lung viral loads and severe lung pathology [50]. In a rhesus macaque model of MERS-CoV infection, prophylactic remdesivir treatment was initiated 24 h prior to inoculation, and MERS-CoV did not induce clinical disease and did not replicate in respiratory tissues, thus preventing the formation of lung lesions [51]. In cell-based assays, the triphosphate form of remdesivir incorporated at position i, and RNA chain termination was delayed, which explained the high potency of remdesivir against RNA [52]. Remdesivir was used to treat the first case of COVID-19 infection in the United States: the patient's clinical condition improved after only one day of remdesivir treatment [53]. A phase II clinical trial of remdesivir was performed by the University of Nebraska Medical Center, and a phase III clinical trial was performed by the China-Japan Friendship Hospital. The results of these clinical trials will be revealed in April 2020. Remdesivir improved pulmonary function, reduced lung viral loads, and ameliorated severe lung pathology. In contrast, prophylactic LPV/RTV-IFNb only slightly reduced viral loads and did not impact other disease parameters, and therapeutic LPV/RTV-IFNb improved pulmonary function, but did not reduce virus replication or severe lung pathology [49]. Overall, these results indicated that remdesivir showed more potential than LPV/RTV-IFNb [54]. In a case report, lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra\u00ae) and arbidol were associated with significant improvements in COVID-19 patients [55]. The efficacy and safety of these antiviral agents for COVID-19 will be assessed in further clinical trials. Thirty-four trials of antiviral agents in patients with COVID\u201019 have been registered up to March 15, 2020 (Table 1\n).",

Using physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models, hydroxychloroquine was found to be more potent than chloroquine in SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero cells [65]. Cytokines IL-6 and IL-10 have been reported to be increased in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection [66,67]. This may progress to a cytokine storm, followed by multiorgan failure and death. Both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have immunomodulatory effects and can suppress the immune response [68,69]. Therefore, 21 clinical studies were launched by Chinese hospitals and the University of Oxford to evaluate the efficacy of these agents in COVID-19 infection (Table 2\n). It is also necessary to determine whether the benefit of chloroquine therapy depends on the age of the patient and the clinical presentation or stage of the disease [70]. If clinical data confirm the biological results, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may be used in prophylaxis as well as curative treatment for individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 [71].",

The administered dose of methylprednisolone varied depending on disease severity. Current interim guidance from the WHO on the clinical management of severe acute respiratory infection when SARS-CoV-2 infection is suspected (released January 28, 2020) advises against the use of corticosteroids unless indicated for another reason. The clinical outcomes of coronavirus and similar outbreaks do not support the use of corticosteroids. In a retrospective observational study of 309 adults who were critically ill with MERS, patients who were given corticosteroids were more likely to require mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and renal replacement therapy [72]. For the management of SARS, corticosteroid treatment was more associated with psychosis, diabetes and avascular necrosis [73,74]. Overall, there is no unique reason to expect that patients with COVID-19 infection will benefit from corticosteroids, and such treatment may be harmful [75]. However, according to our clinical experience, corticosteroids could be prescribed at the right time for the right patients. The clinical trials involving corticosteroids are shown in Table 3\n.",

Considering the relatively high identity of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, the cross-reactivity of anti-SARS-CoV antibodies with the COVID-19 spike protein was assessed. The spike protein is the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies. Fortunately, the SARS-CoV-specific human monoclonal antibody CR3022 binds potently with the COVID-19 RBD [76]. However, other SARS-CoV RBD-directed antibodies 230, m396 and 80R cannot bind to the COVID-19 RBD [77]. CR3022 may be a potential therapeutic candidate, alone or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies, for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 infections. Antibodies MAb114 and REGN-EB3 were designed for treatment of Ebola virus infection and significantly reduce mortality from Ebola virus disease [47]. Monoclonal antibodies can only recognize a single antigen epitope, which limits the use of MAb114 and REGN-EB3 in the treatment of COVID-19. However, the development of COVID-19-specific antibodies requires a long time. It is not easy to apply monoclonal antibodies for new pathogens to clinical practice in a short time.",

In a laboratory test, the COVID-19 virus was isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of a critically ill patient, and it could be neutralized by sera from several patients [80]. Current clinical trials involving convalescent plasma transfusion are shown in Table 4\n. The National Health Commission of China appealed to convalescent patients to donate blood for the treatment of COVID-19 infection. Convalescent plasma should be collected within two weeks after recovery to ensure a high neutralization antibody titer.

Well-designed clinical trials are needed to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma therapy in patients with COVID-19 infection.",

Vaccine development is a long process, and no vaccines are available at the time of a pandemic outbreak. For example, the Ebola epidemic outbreak occurred in 2013, and three years later, the rVSV Ebola Vaccine was selected for phase I clinical trials for its safety and immunogenicity in Africa and Europe [82]. In November 2019, the European Commission granted marketing authorization to Merck Sharp and Dohme B.V. in Europe for their Ebola vaccine, Ervebo. Fortunately, Moderna company announced on February 24, 2020 that the company's experimental mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, known as mRNA-1273, is ready for human testing. It is a remarkably fast development cycle to develop an initial vaccine just weeks after identifying the SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequence. The clinical trial of safety and immunogenicity of mRNA-1273 in the treatment of COVID-19 is under investigation (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04283461). Moreover, a new oral SARS-CoV-2 vaccine has been successfully developed at Tianjin University, which uses food-grade safe Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a carrier and targets the S protein. There are 18 biotechnology companies and universities in China working on SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 have been developed much faster than those for Ebola because of the collaborative efforts of scientists around the world and the fast-track approval of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development efforts by the Chinese health organizations.",

The most common symptoms were fever, cough, expectoration, headache, myalgia or fatigue, diarrhea, and hemoptysis [89]. Some people may experience severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. Histological examination of lung biopsy samples showed bilateral diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates [90]. Other organs are also susceptible to COVID-19. The single-cell RNA-seq data was used to analyse receptor ACE2 expression to reveal the potential risk of different human organs to COVID-19 infection [91]. COVID-19 uses the same cell entry receptor as SARS-CoV, ACE2, which regulates both cross-species and human-to-human transmissions [80]. Proximal tubular cells also express higher levels of the ACE2 receptor, which leads to susceptibility to COVID-19 [91] and induces kidney injury. Data from 33 patients with a complete clinical course were analysed, and the levels of blood urea and creatinine were higher in non-survivors than in survivors [92].",
