Because of the increasing incidence of viral infections, there is a need to evaluate novel engineering control methods for inactivation of viruses on surfaces. Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) is considered a promising method to inactivate viruses. This study evaluated UVGI effectiveness for viruses on the surface of gelatin-based medium in a UV exposure chamber. The effects of UV dose, viral nucleic acid type (single-stranded RNA, ssRNA; single-stranded DNA, ssDNA; double-stranded RNA, dsRNA; and double-stranded DNA, dsDNA), and relative humidity on the virus survival fraction were investigated. For 90% viral reduction, the UV dose was 1.32 to 3.20 mJ/cm 2 for ssRNA, 2.50 to to 4.47 mJ/cm 2 for ssDNA, 3.80 to 5.36 mJ/cm 2 for dsRNA, and 7.70 to 8.13 mJ/cm 2 for dsDNA. For all four tested viruses, the UV dose",

            "text": "V iruses are obligate parasites that cannot multiply or propagate outside specific host cells. In the environment, surfaces become contaminated with viruses through contact with infectious body fluids or the settling of airborne viral particles. For surfaces to serve as sources of viral disease, the involved virus must be able to survive in association with the surface until it encounters a susceptible host. There have been a number of viral outbreaks related to surface-related transmission, such as hepatitis virus, (1, 2) rotavirus, (3, 4) enterovirus, (5, 6) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV). (7, 8) Recently, enteric viruses and SARS CoV have emerged as major public health issues due to their ability to spread through close person-to-person contact and their transmission by droplets generated by an infected person. Enterovirus and SARS CoV could also be spread when a person touches a surface contaminated with infected droplets and then touches their nose, mouth, or eyes. In Taiwan, enterovirus 71 caused 78 deaths in a large outbreak in 1998, and reoccurred in recent years. (5, 6) The outbreak was highly related to contact transmission and resulted in the widespread of hand-foot-andmouth disease among exposed population. For SARS CoV, the outbreak occurred in Taiwan with 73 deaths in 2003. Some evidence reveled that polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive swab samples were recovered from frequently touched surfaces in rooms occupied by SARS patients and in nurse stations used by staff. (9, 10) These observations led to speculation that a possible route of SARS CoV transmission was contact with environmental surfaces.",

(14) In contrast with most disinfectants, UVGI has been well recognized as an effective method for inactivating microorganisms. (12, (15) (16) (17) (18) The mechanisms of UVGI on microorganisms are uniquely vulnerable to light at wavelengths at or near 253.7 nm because the maximum absorption wavelength of a DNA molecule is 260 nm. (19) After UV irradiation, the DNA sequence of microorganisms can form pyrimidine dimers, which can interfere with DNA duplication, as well as lead to destruction of nucleic acids and render the viruses noninfectious. (20) In addition, UVGI effectiveness for microorganisms inactivation was related to irradiation level, duration of irradiation, and relative humidity (RH). (21) (22) (23) Until now, the UVGI virusrelated investigations evaluated only viruses in water (24) (25) (26) and air; (27) these studies found that UVGI would effectively inac-tivate viruses in water and in their airborne phases. Moreover, the type of viral nucleic acid, host cell repair mechanisms, and capsid structure of virus played an important role in virus inactivation.

(28) (29) (30) In this study, the tested viruses were four different bacteriophages: ssRNA (MS2, American Type Culture Collection, ATCC 15597-B1), ssDNA (phi X174, ATCC 13706-B1), dsRNA (phi 6 with envelope lipid, ATCC 21781-B1), and dsDNA (T7, ATCC 11303-B1). The host bacteria were Escherichia coli F-amp (ATCC 15597) for MS2, E. coli CN-13 (ATCC 13706) for phi X174, E. coli 11303 (ATCC 11303) for T7, as well as Pseudomonas syringae (ATCC 21781) for phi 6. In the current study, a high titer stock of bacteriophages (10 9 -10 10 PFU/ml, where PFU is plaque forming units) was prepared via plate lysis and elution. (31) Moreover, the plaque assay (32) for determining virus infectivity and phage cultivation methods were all followed from the ATCC product information sheet. To allow the phage to attach to the host, the bacteriophages were mixed with their own respective host.",

This may be explained by the fact that viruses can form aggregation on surfaces. When compared with studies where UVGI effectiveness was investigated on viruses in suspension, much higher UV doses were needed for 90% inactivation of MS2 virus (12-24 mJ/cm 2 ) than on a surface (1.32 to 3.2 mJ/cm 2 ).

Moreover, UVGI could damage or discolor surfaces and cause possible health effects, such as erythema of the skin and photoleratitis; therefore, humans, plants, and animals should be removed from the area when UVGI is applied. In summary, the effectiveness of UVGI for viral reduction on surfaces may be associated with the type of virus nucleic acid. Viruses with dsRNA or dsDNA may be less susceptible to UVGI inactivation. At high RH, a higher UV dose was required to inactivate virus on surfaces.",

For 90% surface virus inactivation, the UV dose for dsRNA and dsDNA viruses was approximately 2 to 3 times higher than ssRNA and ssDNA viruses, respectively. The susceptibility factor for the viruses was higher at 55% RH than at 85% RH possibly because when RH increases, water sorption onto the virus surface might provide protection against UV-induced DNA or RNA damage.",
