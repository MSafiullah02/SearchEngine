Each serotype includes viruses of both the FIPV and eFCoV biotypes (Hohdatsu et al., 1991a, Hohdatsu et al., 1991b). Type I and II viruses differ mainly in their in vitro growth characteristics, as the members of the serotype I can rarely if ever be propagated in cell-cultures. In the field, the prevalence of FCoV type I appear to be higher, as approximately 70\u201385% of feline infectious peritonitis cases are due to infection with type I viruses (Hohdatsu et al., 1992, Herrewegh et al., 1998, Addie et al., 2003, Kummrow et al., 2005).",

The reliability of these diagnostic approaches were questioned due to the inconsequent correlation of the positive results and the disease outcome. Simons et al. (2005) published a more sophisticated method, targeting subgenomic mRNA (sg-mRNA) production of the virus, detected by conventional RT-PCR. This method was supposed to detect only the intensively replicating viral biotype, since viral sg-mRNAs are served to express the viral structural protein genes. However, the suitability of this test to detect FIPV was questioned by Can-Sahna et al. (2007) on the basis of the high ratio of positive results obtained from the samples of clinically healthy cats. These observations indicate that an assay capable of FCoV sg-mRNA quantitation in the different organs and body fluids would be of very high importance, considering the fact that low-level virus replication occurs even in the case of eFCoV infection (Herrewegh et al., 1997), and hopefully the exact determination of the viral replication rate by measuring the viral sg-mRNA level would be decisive for the establishment of a correct diagnosis (de Groot-Mijnes et al., 2005).",

The novel assay is based on the FRET principle (F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer; F\u00f6rster, 1948) and uses the primer-probe energy transfer (PriProET) technology. This robust real-time PCR technology was previously successfully applied to detect a wide variety of viruses comprising vesicular disease viruses, hepatitis E virus, classical swine virus porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus and porcine circovirus (Rasmussen et al., 2005, Hakhverdyan et al., 2006, B\u00e1lint et al., 2009). Compared to the most wide-spread real-time PCR system, the TaqMan method, PriProET is providing a higher flexibility in the detection of varying target nucleic acids. PriProET is able to overcome multiple mutations located in the targeted region of the viral genome and to amplify a wide range of nucleic acids despite of the variations in the targeted regions (Rasmussen et al., 2003). This robust feature made the PriProET technique suitable for the detection of the FCoV, a highly variable RNA virus.",

In contrast, the limited number of P-sg-QPCR positive results may indicate a relatively low percentage of animals with extensive virus replication level in the intestinal tract. Since the P-sg-QPCR assay is demonstrating intensive virus replication, it is tempting to speculate that this test is capable of identifying the persistent virus-shedder cats, which contribute to the maintenance CoV infection in the catteries, and their ratio can reach even 13% (Addie et al., 2003), and this group includes the cats with the risk of the fatal FIPV variant emerging. However, the majority of cats shed eFCoV intermittently for weeks or months, in some cases at very low level (Addie and Jarrett, 2001, Lutz et al., 2002). Hence, to avoid false negative diagnosis, negative results of the P-sg-QPCR method should be interpreted with caution, and in these cases this assay is a method of choice complementing the widely used genomic real-time QPCR assays in the determination of FCoV status. Another explanation for the surprisingly low copy number of the FCoV sg-mRNA in the gut may be explained with the balanced immune response of the host animals that keeps FCoV replication at low level, and as a consequence, the subgenomic RNA levels may reach much lower rates then their genomic counterparts. Whichever explanation is true, evaluation of quantitative PCR results has to take into consideration the inhibitory compounds of the faecal samples (Dye et al., 2008).",

Interestingly, the basic organ of FCoV replication the gut, displays virus depletion in all examined feline infectious peritonitis cases, the maximal virus replication occurred at a remarkably low level, never even exceeding 1000 copy numbers.
