In LNCaP cells, we occasionally observed the OAS1 transcript, but the protein was not detected by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1C,D). The inconsistency at the transcript level may have been caused by alternative splicing, which can result in premature termination of the peptide in LNCaP cells (Fig. 1C,D).

An analysis of the NCBI dbSNP database revealed that the GG genotype is absent in African American and Sub\u2010Saharan African populations: the GG genotype is absent in ss24415263 African American samples (NCBI AFD_AFR_panel; n = 46) and in ss38908277 Sub\u2010Saharan African samples (NCBI HapMap\u2010YRI; n = 120). The frequency of the G allele in the ss38908277 African American set is only 0.09% (NCBI AoD_African_American; n = 90) compared with a frequency of 9.7% (exclusively from AG genotype) in our normal African American sample set (Table 2). Thus, at least 3 independent studies performed on 3 different platforms (PERLEGEN [ss24415263], ABI XPLORE [ss38908277], and our sequencing\u2010based analysis) on 2 diverse populations have demonstrated the lack of a GG genotype in individuals of African ethnicity (Sub\u2010Saharan and African American). These results suggest that OAS1 polymorphisms and perhaps spliced variants may be determined genetically in African Americans. Surprisingly, the GG genotype was observed in the Caucasian sample set, and its frequency was heavily biased in favor of normal Caucasians (28.2% in normal samples vs 2.4% in cancer samples; OR, 0.062; P < .0001). In contrast, the AA genotype associated with prostate cancer is frequent in African Americans compared with Caucasians. For the sake of brevity, we propose that the higher incidence of prostate cancer in African Americans may be caused by absence of the GG genotype; however, a larger cohort and specific biologic endpoint measurements, such as the effect of this genotype on expression, enzyme activity, apoptosis, proliferation, and other yet unknown biologic activities, are needed to support this statement.",

The GG genotype (in rs10774671) retains the splice site, resulting in high enzyme activity; whereas the AA genotype disrupts the splice site, leading to low enzyme activity.32 Because of altered splicing, the 3 genotypes reportedly generate different OAS1 isoforms: p46 (GG), p46 and p48 (AG), and p48 (AA).38 The p46 and p48 isoforms have identical exons 1 through 6 but divergent exon 7. As expected, Two transcripts corresponding to p46 (approximately 500 bp) and p48 (approximately 400 bp) isoforms were observed in the PC3 and DU145 prostate cancer cell lines, which harbor the AG genotype (rs2660), using primer pairs spanning exons 3 through 7.

The last exons in isoform 1 (p46/E18) and Isoform 3 (p48/9\u20102) are not labeled. The nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1131454 (nucleotide, guanine to adenine [G\u2192A]; protein, glycine to serine [G\u2192S]) appears in all isoforms. The single nucleotide polymorphism rs2660 (G\u2192A) is located in the last exon in Isoform 3 (p48/9\u20102), resulting in a glycine\u2010to\u2010arginine (G\u2192R) amino acid in the 3\u2032\u2010untranslated region in isoform 1 (p46/E18).
