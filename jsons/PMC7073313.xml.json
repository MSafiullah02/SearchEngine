The patient 29 was the first patient identified in Seoul and did not have an epidemiological link or travel history to China. From this patient, the possibility of community transmission was raised. The first pediatric case (patient 32) was diagnosed on February 18, 2020.3 The first fatal case occurred on February 20, 2020. As the numbers of confirmed cases were rapidly increasing, the Korean government raised the alert level from orange to red on February 23 and the Ministry of Education delayed the new school year opening by one week on February 23, 2020 and currently ordered all school closures. As of February 29, 76 countries banned Koreans from entering their countries.4",

His brother died on January 31, and they had a funeral ceremony for two nights and three days from January 31 to February 2 in a hospital funeral home located in Daenam Hospital. Because this was the funeral service of the leader's family, many members (about 170) of the religious group visited the hospital funeral home for 3 days. A 61-year-old woman from this religious group who visited the funeral was later confirmed with COVID-9 on February 23. Of note, she lived in Daegu and occasionally commuted to Seoul. Tracing her movements, KCDC found that she attended two worship services at the Shincheonji Church in Daegu with at least 1,000 other members of her religious group.",

The youngest patient was a 35-year old Mongolian patient. He was already in a serious condition from chronic hepatic failure with cirrhosis and esophageal variceal bleeding. A 40-year old male with hypertension died suddenly, was found the next morning by a coworker, diagnosed with COVID-19 later. Including this patient, the diagnosis was made after death in five patients (5/22, 22.7%). One patient (mortality number 3) died at home suddenly, the rest of the three patients died during hospitalization (mortality numbers 1, 9, and 16), and one patient (mortality number 14) died at home while waiting for the pending test result. Of note, two patients (mortality numbers 13 and 22) were at home isolation with positive results waiting for the hospitalization, but their condition aggravated rapidly and they died. Three patients (mortality numbers 13, 14, and 16) died on arrival at the hospital.1415 Therefore, even though most of COVID-19 patients may have mild clinical courses, individuals with old age and/or underlying medical conditions should be carefully monitored.",
