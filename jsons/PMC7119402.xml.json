Among the 12 patients with non\u2013West Nile viral meningitis/encephalitis, mild/transient relative lymphopenia (\u226421% lymphocytes) was present in 5 patients (42%) on admission to the hospital. All 6 patients with West Nile encephalitis had relative lymphopenia. We found that even in this small sample relative lymphocyte counts were higher in patients with non\u2013West Nile viral meningitis/encephalitis. This prompted us to review our 2001\u20132003 experience with West Nile encephalitis.",

Lymphopenia may be present in a variety of noninfectious disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Hodgkin lymphomas, CD4 lymphocytopenia, severe combined immunodeficiency, ataxia-telangiectasia, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, and myasthenia gravis (1, 2, 3).",
