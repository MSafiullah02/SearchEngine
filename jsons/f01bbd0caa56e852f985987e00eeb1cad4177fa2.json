Such methods cannot meet the need for rapid and accurate detection of pathogens in the field because of its long period and complicated operation. In addition, there are some other conventional detection methods, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which are faster than the gold standard method. However, these methods are also difficult to carry out in field conditions (Eriksson and Aspan 2007) . The PCR method has been widely used in laboratories and hospitals. In order to detect the target gene of pathogens, it needs to extract and purify the genome in the sample first, and then detect the target gene with specific primers (Wisselink et al. 2017 ). The operation is complicated, and it takes 1-2 h to obtain the result. The colloidal gold based-immunoassay has the characteristics of low cost, simple operation, and rapid detection (within 15 min). It has been widely used as a rapid diagnostic tool, and is suitable for on-site detections. However, it is not sensitive and accurate enough, and it cannot provide quantitative result (Song et al. 2016) .",

This unique property makes it an excellent optic label with many advantages, such as no background interference, no quenching, and suitable for quantitative analysis.
