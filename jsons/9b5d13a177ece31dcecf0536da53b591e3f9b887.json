While approaches to measuring clinical and economic value are wellspecified, the means of identifying and assimilating relevant societal values in HTA are not [4, 5] .",

Two contrasting approaches to the elicitation of societal values have prevailed: population-based surveys and exercises in deliberative engagement. Both admit of strengths and limitations. While survey methods are able to elicit preferences from a large swath of the public, they often preclude in-depth reflection and discussion about the complex ethical issues involved in setting priorities [5, 6] . By contrast, deliberative engagement with patients or publics offers rich opportunities for nuanced and recursive consideration of the values that motivate allocative decisions, but from the bounded perspective of a small and select group of persons [7] . A few attempts have been made to marry deliberative and survey methods, either by bookending deliberative events with survey questions or by embedding opportunities for deliberation within survey designs [8] [9] [10] . We adapt an approach to the latter to investigate societal preferences for allocating health care resources to children as compared to adults.",

Qualityadjusted life years (QALYs) have played a dominant role in assessing the value of health interventions, as a universal metric for comparisons of benefit among different technologies that incorporate quantity and quality of life into a unified indicator. Closely allied to the use of QALYs as an outcome measure in applied health economic evaluation is the assumption of utilitarian QALY maximization as a normative goaland thus decision-criterionwhen selecting the best alternative among competing interventions [19] .",

Moral philosophers and social choice theorists have challenged the moral legitimacy of purely consequentialist approaches to health care rationing, including QALY maximization, citing the relevance of ethical concepts ranging from distributive justice, priority to the worst off, and rightsbased entitlements in health resource allocation [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . Empirical studies of public preferences for health care resource allocation often employ recipient age as a proxy for QALY gains. Studies of public preferences have yielded considerable evidence favouring priority to younger populations [13] [14] [15] [16] . Such studies have often compared adults of various ages; select studies include a childhood age range among their comparators (15, (30) (31) (32) (33) . However, few studies have explored public preferences for health resource allocation decisions related to children as such. underlying societal preferences for health resource allocation: 1) 'health maximization ageism' (constant relative value of life-years, irrespective of age); 2) 'productivity ageism' (higher value of life-years in young adulthood, related to greater social and economic productivity); and 3) 'fair innings ageism' (emphasis on opportunity for equal aggregate lifetime health (or QALYs) through priority to those expected to experience less, such as the young or disadvantaged) (16) . Each of these approaches is outcome-oriented and concerned with health gains, though calibrated to prioritize different groups based on alternative ethical arguments.",

Notably, they also empirically examine the relevance of deontological considerations in health care rationing, including personal responsibility for one's health state, socioeconomic status, and procedural considerations in priority setting. Their work demonstrates a disavowal by participants of pure QALY maximization, and highlights other salient normative considerations for potential incorporation into rationing exercises, including equality of treatment, individual rights and duties, and procedural fairness (17, 36) . Relatedly, a limited body of evidence points to the impact of embedded moral reasoning on attenuated public preference for the young, suggesting that deliberation on a range of ethical principles can influence stated preferences for allocating resources based on age (10) .

This lack of evidence has contributed to a vacuum of both theoretical and context-specific knowledge about societal preferences related to the prioritization of health system resources for children. The need for more and better knowledge of public values attached to health care priority-setting affecting children is underscored by inherent challenges associated with the assessment of child health technologies [38] [39] [40] . Health system funding decisions for children are often constrained by limited evidence for the clinical efficacy or economic efficiency of child health technologies [41] . Childhood diseases are typically rare, the conduct of research in pediatric populations is complex, and standard metrics of clinical and economic assessment fail to incorporate unique dimensions of childhood, such as family context and life-course impacts [1, 42] ",

We postulated that the moral reasoning exercise, which incorporated a number of valuesbased considerations specific to children, would prompt participants to consider their allocative preferences in light of these unique concerns.

We further hypothesized that participants in the intervention arm would display stronger aggregate preference for children across all the clinical scenarios tested, regardless of the duration of life years gained, as a result of their access to a varied palette of ethical principles by which to justify preferential allocation to children, including vulnerability, dependency, potential, and social distinction.",

The principles included in our moral reasoning exercise were derived from a systematic review of the literature on social values relevant to child health and social policy, refined through an in-depth qualitative case study of health technology assessment and policymaking for children in Canada [47, 48] . Iterative refinements to the survey were informed by a pilot phase with experts (n=3) and laypersons (n=2) and field testing with members of the public (n=32). The final survey questionnaire directed respondents to assign numerical preference scores for the allocation of resources in different health care scenarios based on age-related criteria. It presented each participant with the same five hypothetical treatment scenarios (chronic blood disease, liver transplant, cancer therapy, palliative care, and eating disorder); these scenarios were intended to provide variation in disease characteristics such as acuity, morbidity, mortality, potential for cure, and nature of Participants chose between funding for treatment among adult (average age 40) and child (average age 10) patients, from the perspective of a citizen advisor to a health system administrator. Preferences were captured as continuous variables on a visual analog scale (VAS) from -5 (full preference for children) to +5 (full preference for adults), with zero representing neutrality. We employed a VAS design to explore changes in the strength of participant preferences for children or adults in order to capture more subtle variation in preference than would have been possible with categorical choices, while still allowing for preference neutrality.",

The exercise presented subjects in the intervention group with a list of twelve ethical principles relevant to allocative decisions ( Figure 2 ).

This explanation is supported by theories of rational decisionmaking from the field of cognitive psychology that posit dual-process thinking, distinguishing intuition from reasoning [51] [52] [53] . The design of our studyincluding the survey format and pacing, question framing, and lay samplemay have induced intuitive responses from some participants, in the face of complex moral problems characterized by inherent uncertainty. In particular, participants may have allowed more obvious differentiators, such as discrepant benefits in length of life, to intuitively shape their preferences, rather than take the time and cognitive effort to work through conflicting moral choices in a rule-bound manner. This is likely particularly true of those unexposed to the moral reasoning intervention, and might explain why preference score differences between the intervention and control groups were largest in respect of cancer therapy and eating disorders treatment. It may also explain why variance in preference scores narrowed consistently across scenarios in the intervention group as compared to the control group: it is possible that this reduction in variance represents a reduction in choice uncertainty, in the context of enhanced participant reliance on analytical reasoning induced by the study intervention.",

This finding is in keeping with much of the extant evidence on societal preferences for allocation to the young, but adds depth and specificity in preference in response to changes in the duration of benefit from a given intervention [16] . In the face of life-long benefits (e.g. life-saving interventions), their study participants gave consistent precedence to younger groups when allocating scarce resources. By contrast, when juxtaposed with life-long benefits, fixed benefits induced a preference pattern that privileged young to middle adulthood. Our results may indicate similar moral intuitions behind participant choices, though with the notable difference of an equal allocation option. Where pure QALY maximization was possiblenamely, in the cancer therapy and eating disorders treatment scenariosparticipants seemed to adjudge the life-long benefits that would accrue to children too large to overlook. Conversely, in the scenarios with fixed benefits, preference for allocation to children was weaker in the control group, and a trend toward preference for equal allocation J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f emerged in the intervention cohort. An alternative explanation could be that participants perceived scenario-specific differences in duration of benefit more readily than other benefits that, though not explicitly mentioned, also retain moral relevance in the context of these and similar scenarios. Such benefits could include reduction in inequality of outcomesfor instance, founded on inherent characteristics of the disease (rarity) or population (vulnerability, dependency)or equitable chances to live a full life ('fair innings') [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] .",

Nord et al. elicited allocative preferences from study participants within two different assumed perspectives: a 'veil of ignorance', in which the participants themselves might need the health intervention in question one day; and a health system administrator role, in which they were tasked with decisions about resource allocation to others from a budgetary standpoint [15] . They found that the tendency to privilege younger people in allocative decisions was more evident amongst those who assumed the latter perspective, and argued that the degree of emotional remove induced by the shift in perspective might account for this difference. Evidence from our study for the moderating effect of a moral reasoning exercise on participant preferences for allocation to children, from an administrative perspective, suggests the opportunity for ethical reflection mitigated participant willingness to discriminate between groups on the basis of age. This may reflect choice uncertainty and a resultant instinct for preference neutrality, rather than evidence of real, rich moral deliberation. Alternatively, this may represent a 'depersonalizing' effect of moral deliberation on allocative decision-making, one sufficient to impact societal preferences for health resource allocationbut in the opposite direction to that observed by Nord et al.",

Dominant modes of health economic evaluation privilege interventions that maximize aggregate individual and societal utility, typically in the form of the duration and magnitude of benefits reaped and the size of the population reached. Our results demonstrate a stronger preference for children in the hypothetical scenarios (cancer and eating disorders) in which the duration of benefit accrued mainly to children; this may represent an underlying motivation by participants to maximize benefits. However, we also observed a strong inclination for equality and humanitarianism amongst study participants, regardless of experimental group. The three principles deemed most salient to priority-setting were equal treatment, relief of suffering, and rule of rescue. None of these prioritizes age as a relevant variable; each starts from a belief in the intrinsic value of all human life, and resists grading that J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f value by social context or circumstance. Our results, therefore, suggest the need to incorporate other values into health care priority-setting, as some value frameworks for funding decisions have begun to do [63] . The salience of these findings to priority-setting efforts in the context of public health emergenciesincluding access to scarce ventilators or drugs in the context of the COVID-19 pandemicis readily apparent. They furnish empirical evidence for the adjudication and refinement of ethical frameworks for triage and resource allocation during the pandemic based on public values in Canada [64, 65] . Efforts to incorporate a broader range of public values and preferences in health and social policy decisions also involve inherent risks. Among them is the need to confront and grapple with public attitudes that conflict with the fundamental normative or legal principles that structure most democratic societies, including basic commitments to the protection of individual rights and nondiscrimination [66] . Future research to explore this tension and ways to resolve or address it is warranted.",

This includes the potential value of deliberative public engagement to health policymaking, particularly in domains where distinct ideas about the public good may compete. Specific to children, few efforts to incorporate public deliberation in research and policy on child health and social policy priorities have prevailed to date. In the face of resource scarcity, evidence-informed child health and social policies will depend on the careful elicitation and integration of public values. This and allied work bear potential relevance in social policy domains beyond health, including public attitudes to J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 'deservingness' attached to welfare state distributional policies in domains as diverse as labour markets and education [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] .

It furnishes a critical lens for the interpretation of stated preference surveys; introduces a note of caution into dominant modes of health care funding allocation decisions premised on utility maximization; and implies the value of deliberative methods as a complement to both. We observed a strong inclination for equality and humanitarianism amongst study participants, regardless of experimental group. These moral impulses prevailed over consequentialist logic, including priority to the young founded on aggregate benefit. The stability of these principles in the face of changing allocative preferences signals their importance as public valuesbut it also hints at the complexity of values-based decision-making. The public seems, at face value, to believe in equality of access and defend a set of shared human entitlements to care. It also seems to assign intuitive priority to children. The challenge of reconciling these convictions demands processes nimble enough to negotiate this paradox.

The greater predilection for neutrality in the experimental group may represent stronger endorsement of equality as a primary justification for resource allocation, induced by exposure to a range of humanitarian principles, including statements about equality, relief of suffering, and rule of rescue. Conversely, participants may have found it difficult to resolve competing moral intuitions through reasoned deliberation, particularly in the scripted and time-bound context of a survey. Greater preference neutrality in the intervention group could represent a tendency to reject a difficult moral choice between adults and children, one that pulled responses closer to zero and limited stronger preferences to scenarios where obvious benefits (such as differential QALY gains) made the moral leap less daunting.",

It was greatest in relation to cancer therapy and eating disorders treatment. These were the only scenarios where the gain in life-years from treatment was not bounded by the natural history of the condition and equalized across hypothetical programs, but tagged to normal life expectancy. Consequently, there was a clear expected difference in the benefit to be gained (as measured in length of life) between the idealized adult and child populations of interest.
