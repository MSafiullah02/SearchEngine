In healthy pediatric patients, the safe apneic time is about 4 minutes, but critically ill pediatric patients are likely to desaturate more quickly.9,10 Therefore, with apneic oxygenation, an oxygenation diffusion gradient between the hypopharynx and the alveoli is generated, allowing the pulmonary capillaries to continue absorbing oxygen in the absence of ventilation, thus preventing desaturation.1,2 Furthermore, apneic oxygenation, being a noninvasive procedure, is cost-effective with no reported complications.1,11",

For instance, putting up reminders and providing an additional oxygen source could be done much faster than educating and training of all medical and nursing staff. Also, we were unable to ascertain the compliance to and hence, the effectiveness of each intervention on the outcome of interest. Also, although we have grouped our interventions and implemented them under a care bundle. We should mention that not all the interventions were always required each time an RSI was performed. For instance, the pre-intubation checklist, \u201ccopiloting\u201d of airway doctor and airway nurse, as well as enhanced documentation, were core components of the care bundle for performing apneic oxygenation during RSI. However, placing reminders and additional oxygen sources were one-time interventions, while education during airway workshop and simulation training were ongoing efforts made to help achieve our aim at quality improvement.",
