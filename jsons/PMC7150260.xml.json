Sudden death thus is an unexpected fatal event that very often is unwitnessed. Many of these deaths occur during sleep or at an unknown time. There is no consensus on the exact duration between the onset of symptoms and death for an unexpected fatal event to be considered sudden in nature. The most acceptable definition of sudden death is given by the World Health Organization, which defines sudden death as any death occurring within 24 h from the onset of symptoms (Saukko and Knight, 2004). Cardiovascular system disorders are reported as the leading causes of sudden deaths. Despite advances in medicine regarding the diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases, a large number of sudden and unexpected deaths are caused by infections. Sudden deaths resulting from infectious diseases remain a cause of concern, especially in the developing countries (Mittal et al., 2014).",

Infections/infectious diseases are thus caused by the invasion and multiplication of various pathogenic macro- and microorganisms in host tissues. The process usually involves an agent, reservoir, port of exit, mode of transmission, port of entry, and host. These infectious agents include: bacteria, viruses, viroids, and prions, rickettsiae, mycoplasmas, fungi, protozoa, helminths, etc. Various etiological agents and a few common infections caused by them are listed in Table 1\n. Bacterial and viral infections remain the most common causes of sudden death from infectious diseases. Infections by prions, rickettsiae, and mycoplasmas are usually not associated with sudden and unexpected deaths.",

The infectious diseases which are commonly associated with increased morbidity and mortality are human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), pneumonia, tuberculosis, and myocarditis. Death from infectious diseases may occur as a direct consequence of the infection or from complications in an immunosuppressed host. Sudden deaths from infectious diseases are mostly reported in the acute phases of infection, and are due to secondary infections in an immunocompromised host. For example, in adult HIV infections, sudden death may result from infective causes due to opportunistic infections. Untreated/undiagnosed infectious diseases of a chronic nature also form a major portion of reported sudden deaths, especially in developing countries. Sudden death due to infectious disease may be categorized based on the organ system involvement. The common infectious causes of sudden death based on organ system involvement are listed in Table 2\n. Though no organ system is spared by infectious agents, the majority of sudden deaths from infectious causes are due to cardiovascular system and respiratory system involvement. In the pediatric population infections of the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and central nervous system account for the majority of cases of sudden death.",

Granulomatous myocarditis is another rare disease of the heart that is reported in tuberculosis (Kanchan et al., 2010), syphilis, tularemia, brucellosis, and fungal infections. The mechanism of death includes arrhythmias, cardiac rupture, coronary occlusion, obstruction to pulmonary blood flow leading to fatal hemorrhage, and impaired myocardial contractility. Characteristic granulomatous lesions in infectious diseases of the myocardium are shown in Table 3\n. Chlamydial infection has also been associated with endocarditis, myocarditis, and pericarditis (Odeh and Oliven, 1992).

            "text": "Sudden deaths are occasionally attributed to protozoan infections, such as malaria and amebiasis. Malaria has been reported as a cause of sudden unexplained death in malaria endemic regions (Rastogi et al., 2010, Menezes et al., 2010). Malaria is caused by a protozoal parasite belonging to the genus Plasmodium and is transmitted by the female anopheles mosquitoes. Malaria is broadly classified as falciparum and non-falciparum. Death is rare with non-falciparum malaria; however, the mortality approaches 10\u201320% in patients with complicated falciparum malaria. It may be the cause of sudden death in nonimmune and susceptible individuals such as immigrants, tourists, business travelers, and sailors. Malaria is also a cause of disease and death among children under 5 years and pregnant women. Cerebral malaria (Alunni-Perret et al., 2010), acute renal insufficiency, acute pulmonary edema, and acute respiratory distress syndrome are possible mechanisms of sudden death due to malaria (Menezes et al., 2012). Sudden death in malaria may also be due to rupture of an enlarged spleen, which is fragile in malaria and more vulnerable to rupture.",

The acid-fast bacilli in tuberculosis may be demonstrated using the Ziehl\u2013Neelsen stain (Figure 6(b)) or molecular tests such as the ligase chain reaction (LCR) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) may be used to demonstrate the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA complex. Legionella pneumophila which causes legionnaire\u2019 disease may be demonstrated by a modified silver stain (Dieterle stain) or by immunofluorescence and culture. Microscopy of cadaveric blood smears in malaria may reveal remnants of intraerythrocytic parasites. This postmortem finding of parasitemia in sudden death due to malaria, however, varies between 25% and 80% (Muehlethaler et al., 2005, Wichmann et al., 2003). The diagnosis of viral infections in many cases can only be made on special investigations, for example, culture, electron microscopy, serology, or molecular testing. Diagnostic modalities in fungal infections include culture of the organism and histological demonstration of the organisms in tissue, which may be facilitated by special stains such as the periodic acid\u2013Schiff (PAS) or Grocott\u2019s methenamine silver stain.",

To prevent false-positive postmortem blood cultures the following procedures should be observed. The body should be refrigerated as soon as possible and movement of the body should be limited to decrease the possibility of postmortem bacterial spread. An aseptic technique should be used to collect the sample, which should be stored and transported in the correct medium and at the right temperature. Close liaison with the microbiology and virology laboratories is important to guide the collection, preservation, transport, and evaluation of specimens. This is particularly important in cases where there are positive cultures with negative histological findings. Sampling at multiple sites and determining the antibiotic sensitivities may also be helpful in determining the significance of positive cultures. The finding of a \u2018pure\u2019 as opposed to \u2018mixed\u2019 culture helps to determine the significance of findings. The type of organism in relation to the site where it was cultured also may help to differentiate contaminants from significant positive cultures.",

A thorough medicolegal investigation is warranted in these deaths, which should include a complete and detailed autopsy examination. In cases with nonspecific morphological changes, investigation of appropriate autopsy samples by recently developed laboratory techniques may prove invaluable and shed light on the cause of death. Although the role of histology in cases of sudden death has been highlighted, histological evaluation is not very commonly done in many areas, especially in developing countries; its significance, therefore, needs to be emphasized along with the use of microbiology and molecular diagnostic methods. Genetic engineering has led to the development of highly infectious and virulent strains of microorganisms. Forensic pathologists should be aware of the importance of infectious causes of sudden death in the present era of bioterrorism and emergent and reemerging diseases.",
