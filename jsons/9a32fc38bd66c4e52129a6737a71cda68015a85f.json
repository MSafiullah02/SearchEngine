We propose to represent the heterogeneity in the composition of the metapopulations as layers in a multiplex network, where nodes would correspond to geographical areas and layers account for the mobility patterns of agents of the same class. We analyze classical epidemic models within this framework and obtain an excellent agreement with extensive Monte Carlo simulations. This agreement allows us to derive analytical expressions of the epidemic threshold and to face the challenge of characterizing a real multiplex metapopulation, the city of Medell\u00edn in Colombia, where different recurrent mobility patterns are observed depending on the socioeconomic class of the agents. Our framework allows us to unveil the geographical location of those patches that trigger the epidemic state at the critical point. A careful exploration reveals that social mixing between classes and mobility crucially determines these critical patches and, more importantly, it can produce abrupt changes of the critical properties of the epidemic onset.",

These outbreaks are increasingly characterized by the small elapsed time between initial infections in a single region to the global epidemic state affecting different cities, regions, countries, and, in some cases, continents. Thus, in recent years a great effort has been devoted to understanding the fast unfolding of emergent diseases and to design both local and global contention strategies. The most common avenue to tackle this problem is to adapt classical epidemic models taking into account the multiscale nature of diseases propagation [1, 2] .",

However, in order to understand the geographical diffusion of diseases, one has to combine these microscopic contagion processes with the long-range disease propagation due to human mobility across different spatial scales. To tackle this problem, epidemic modeling has relied on reaction-diffusion dynamics in metapopulations, a family of models first used in the field of population ecology [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . For the case of epidemic modeling, the usual metapopulation scenario [8] [9] [10] is as follows. A population is distributed in a set of patches, with the size (number of individuals) of each patch in principle different. The individuals within each patch are well mixed; i.e., pathogens can be transmitted from an infected host to any of the healthy agents placed in the same patch with the same probability. The second ingredient of metapopulation frameworks concerns the mobility of agents. Each host is allowed to change its current location and occupy another patch, thus fostering the spread of pathogens at the system level. The mobility of agents between different patches is usually represented in terms of a network where nodes are locations while a link between two patches represents the possibility of moving between them.",

In the past decade, important steps towards the inclusion of realistic mobility structures have been made [13] [14] [15] [16] . These approaches had to compromise between realism and analytical feasibility. On one side, lengthy mechanistic simulations [1, 17] provide fair predictions on realistic scenarios while, on the other, theoretical frameworks allowing for analytical results usually rely on strong assumptions limiting their applicability to real-world threats. For instance, it is usual to assume simplified mobility patterns and mean-field approximations for hosts' and patches' behavior to be able to predict the onset of an outbreak. In these models, random diffusion of agents between the nodes is often used as a proxy of human mobility while, as in the heterogeneous mean field in contact networks [18] , subpopulations with identical connectivity are assumed to be equally affected by the disease.",

Multiplex networks [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] consist of a set of L networks (usually called layers) and a set of N nodes. Each node is represented once in each network layer, allowing it to share different connectivity patterns in each of the L layers. In terms of metapopulation models, for which nodes account for geographical locations, each layer represents the mobility network of each type of agent, while each subpopulation is represented in each layer. This way, the multiplex formalism captures the coexistence, within each subpopulation, of different types of agents with different mobility preferences. These differences can account for age-specific mobility habits (capturing different preferences in the locations visited) or the socioeconomic segregation of residences and work places across urban areas. In these cases, the diverse mobility patterns corresponding to each agent type affect in different ways the onset of epidemics.",

These classes are represented as a multiplex metapopulation of six layers, each one encoding the demography as well as the mobility patterns of each class. We analyze the spread of diseases over this real configuration and introduce quantifiable measures to shed light on the influence of the social mixing among socioeconomic classes and mobility on the critical properties of the epidemic onset. The interplay between socioeconomical mixing and mobility produces nontrivial effects with strong consequences on the criticality of the epidemics.

Typically, heterogeneous meanfield techniques have been applied in a number of works related to epidemic spreading in contact networks and metapopulations. As anticipated above, the main assumption of the heterogeneous mean field is to correlate the relevant parameters of nodes and patches with their number of connections to other nodes, i.e., their degree. This way, two distant patches that are connected to the same number (but not the same set) of locations are considered to have the same static and dynamical properties such as, for instance, the number of habitants and the fraction of infected agents. This assumption, although being strong, has been shown to be valid for small epidemic sizes, thus allowing quite good predictions of epidemic thresholds.",

This is an interesting result that differentiates what has been recently observed in epidemic processes in multiplex contact networks [40, 41] , where coupling L layers yields an overall epidemic threshold that is equal to the smallest threshold of the isolated layers or, in other words, the epidemic onset is driven by the largest of the maximum eigenvalues of the set of adjacency matrices that define the layers.

The monotonous decrease of \u03bb c \u00f0p\u00de corroborates that, for these three synthetic multiplexes, mobility enhances the spread of the disease. Interestingly, for the case of noninteracting layers, the epidemic threshold of the ER-SF and SF-SF multiplexes follows the same dependence on the mobility. This result indicates that it is the layer with the smallest threshold, the SF one (see Fig. 12 in Appendix A), the one driving epidemic outbreaks.

This possibility allows us to gain insights about the role played by the interactions between different kinds of agents in spreading processes. To shed light on the applicability of this formalism in real populations and to fully exploit the possibilities offered by the multiplex formulation, we now study the SIS and SIR spreading dynamics in a real urban system, the city of Medell\u00edn (Colombia), where six different socioeconomic classes coexist. Specifically, these social classes range from 1, which includes those inhabitants with the lowest incomes, to class 6, corresponding to the wealthiest individuals. The separation into six socioeconomic classes in Colombia [42] and, in particular, in large cities such as Medell\u00edn (the second largest city in Colombia with around 5 \u00d7 10 6 inhabitants) leads to a different demographic distribution across towns and, equally important, to different mobility patterns due to their heterogeneous needs and transportation services at hand (see Refs. [43, 44] for details).",

It can be observed that this indicator captures the transition points previously reported as sudden changes in the localization of the leading eigenvector of the matrix M 0 for small values of p and \u03b3. These sudden changes consist of abrupt decreases of the IPR, pointing out the delocalization processes necessary to move from one localized eigenvector to another one localized in the other node. Finally, as p increases, for all \u03b3 values, a drop in IPR occurs due to the delocalization of the eigenvector components because of the geographical mixing provided by the large mobility of agents.",

The most logical way to tackle this problem is to compute the total number of contacts performed by the agents of a given patch i and socioeconomic class \u03b1.

The first interesting result is the presence of epidemic detriment with mobility [26] for the full multiplex structure while, for each individual layer, the phase diagram does not show this phenomenon. Additionally, the multiplex formalism allows us to study the mixing among the different socioeconomic classes in Medell\u00edn using a single parameter (intensity of the interlayer link). An exhaustive analysis of the epidemic threshold reveals that, when mixing between different socioeconomic classes is small, there is a sudden change in the localization components of the eigenvector controlling the epidemic onset as mobility increases. This transition implies that the set of subpopulations triggering the spread of the disease changes abruptly, and can be detected. Moreover, we derive an indicator that is the effective number of contacts of the agents of one agent from a given patch and class. This indicator, which only depends on the underlying multiplex metapopulation, allows us to determine the drivers nodes and, more importantly, the transition points where the abrupt changes in the localization of epidemic outbreaks occur. These results point out that the multiplex nature of urban systems and the interplay between mobility and the social mixing of their inhabitants must be carefully taken into account in order to design efficient containment policies.",

In Fig. 14 , we plot the epidemic diagrams corresponding to different values of the degree of mobility p for both SIS and SIR diseases. These diagrams are obtained via Monte Carlo simulations (points) and by solving the Markovian equations (lines), showing an excellent agreement. Interestingly, we can also notice that, in Medell\u00edn, mobility hinders epidemic onsets, since the epidemic threshold increases with p. This counterintuitive behavior, already reported for monolayer configurations [26] , emerges from the homogenization of the demographic distribution across urban areas as mobility increases. Note that the value of \u03bb has been rescaled by the critical value at p \u00bc 0, i.e., that of a well-mixed population of n \u00bc 5000 individuals: \u03bb c \u00f0p \u00bc 0\u00de \u00bc \u03bc=n \u00bc 4 \u00d7 10 \u22124 .
