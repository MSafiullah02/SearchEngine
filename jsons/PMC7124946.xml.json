Medical staff coverage was secured onsite, and the working hours of the satellite pharmacy were extended.Walk-in patients: Patients who showed up to the clinic without an appointment were screened for infection and were either directed to the triage area for suspected infection or seen by physicians covering the clinic, according to the result of the screening checklist.Oncology physicians managed patients who could be seen in the outpatient setting. Patients who required admission were sent to an alternative hospital. Patients were transported via hospital ambulance if their condition was unstable; patients in stable condition were transferred by private car.
