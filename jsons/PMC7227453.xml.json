Decreased absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) at the time of CARV infection is probably the main negative prognostic factor for progression to LRTD and is associated with an increased mortality after allo-HSCT [6, 7, 9, 10]. With this in mind, we can hypothesize that CARV infections in the umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) setting, which is associated with delayed T-cell immune reconstitution, could be associated with greater morbidity and mortality than with other modalities of allo-HSCT. However, data regarding CARV infections after UCBT are lacking.",

Recipients with persistent and severe respiratory symptoms and repeated influenza virus detection received a second course of oseltamivir. For recipients with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, only those with proven LRTD were treated with aerosolized ribavirin (2 g/8 h) until improvement. Patients with human parainfluenza virus (HPiV) infection were not routinely treated with ribavirin, except in cases with respiratory failure and oxygen support. From May 2016, oseltamivir 75 mg/12 h orally was given to recipients with influenza virus infection until resolution symptoms. In cases of severe pneumonia with oxygen requirements and/or prolonged shedding with persistent respiratory symptoms (>3 weeks) an increased oseltamivir dose (150 mg/12 h) was given until resolution of respiratory symptoms. RSV and HPiV were managed according to our interventional protocol [15]. Briefly, ribavirin therapy was instituted in recipients with LRTD caused by RSV or HPIV (aerosolized formulation), whereas recipients with URTD (oral formulation) had to score \u2265 3 points of the immunodeficiency scoring index (ISI) points and/or \u22652 RFs according to the ECIL-4 guidelines [16], and/or present one or more co-infective virus(es) before starting ribavirin. Annual influenza vaccination was recommended to all patients after the third month following UCBT, except for patients with moderate to severe GVHD at the time of vaccination program who had received gammaglobulin, ATG or rituximab within the 3 months before the flu vaccine period. In these patients, vaccination was delayed at physician discretion [17].",

LRTD was classified as possible or confirmed as previously described [18]. Possible LRTD was defined by the detection of a CARV in the upper respiratory tract in recipients developing new pulmonary infiltrates. Confirmed LRTD was defined when the above-mentioned clinical features were accompanied by isolation of the virus in tracheal aspirates or by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Probable LRTD was not considered, since bronchoscopies were not performed in patients without radiological proof of pulmonary involvement. Progression of a URTD to an LRTD was defined as the onset of pneumonia in patients with a prior or concurrent URTD [10].",

From January 2007 to December 2009, the CARV screening strategy relied on rapid detection test such as shell vial cultures (Vircell, Spain), direct staining by using monoclonal antibodies for the presumptive detection of RSV, influenza A and B virus, HPiV 1, 2, and 3 and adenovirus (ADV) (DAKO, USA) or by using an in vitro rapid immunochromatographic assay that detected RSV and Influenza A and B (Alere BinaxNOW\u00ae). From January 2010 to April 2016, first-line CARV screening test was based on rapid antigen detection for influenza and RSV through the automated Simplexa\u2122 influenza A/B and VRS Direct assay (SPX, Focus Diagnostics). Patients with negative results in rapid antigen detection with impaired respiratory symptoms or requiring hospital admission underwent a second-line test based on a RT-PCR multiplex platform consisting on the CLART\u00ae PneumoVir DNA array assay (Genomica, Spain). This RT-PCR method can detect ADVs; human bocavirus (HBoV); human coronavirus (HCoV) types 229E; influenza A virus A/H1N1, A/H3N2; influenza B and C; human metapneumovirus (HMPV); HPiV 1, 2, 3, and 4; RSV A-B; and enterovirus/rhinovirus (EvRh). From May 2016, first-line CARV screening was performed by the CLART\u00ae PneumoVir DNA array assay and from July 2018 by BioFire FilmArray\u00ae Respiratory Panel (BioFire Diagnostics, Salt Lake City). This RT-PCR assay is able to detect 15 respiratory viruses: influenza virus types A, B, and C, ADV, HCoV HKU1, NL63, 229E and OC43, HMPV, EvRh, HPiV types 1\u20134 and RSV, as well as three bacteria: Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Bordetella pertussis.",

The probabilities of posttransplant events such as CARV infection, acute and chronic GVHD, engraftment, NRM, and relapse were estimated by the cumulative incidence method [19, 20]. Univariate analyses of posttransplantation outcomes were calculated using the Gray test [21]. For cumulative incidence analyses of CARV infection, death in complete remission and relapse occurring before CARV were considered as competing events, while relapse was the competing event for NRM. The assumption of proportional hazards over time was tested for all posttransplant explanatory covariates using a time-dependent covariate by univariate Cox regression model. When a time-dependent covariate was included in the final models, multivariate analyses were carried out by Cox proportional hazards regression with inclusion of those variables with a p < 0.1 in the prior univariate testing. To assess the impact of GVHD and CARV infection in UCBT outcomes (NRM and OS), these variables were analyzed as time-dependent covariates.",

Because 79% of our UCBT recipients who develop LRTD undergo BAL examination, the observed results of LRTDs by CARVs are probably an accurate measure of the true frequency of these infections. We identified lymphopenia <0.5 \u00d7 109/L as risk factor for progression to LRTD. This finding is somewhat expected since lymphopenia was the main risk factor for LRTD progression in several studies [6, 7, 9, 10]. Another relevant finding was that the earlier period of UCBT (2007\u20132009) was associated with higher probability of LRTD progression. This data suggest that the progressive introduction of more sophisticate CARVs screening technics could lead not only to an increased ability in detecting CARVs (and as a consequence observing a higher incidence of CARV) but more importantly that the use of less sensitive test may have produced a delay in the identification of CARVs in the URTD stage an thus a delay in the inception of antiviral drugs when available before the progression to LRTD. Finally, it is of interest to highlight that in approximately one third of the cases co-pathogens were detected, being striking the frequent co-pathogenicity with at least one respiratory virus, as also previously reported for other stem cell sources [8, 24].",

Again, this finding supports that CARV infections are still of major concern in the UCBT setting and require urgent attention and efforts to improve outcomes.",

In this sense, lymphocytopenia was independently associated with both overall CARV infection and CARV LRTD day 60 all-cause mortality. It should be highlighted, that most studies performed to date focusing on immune reconstitution following UCBT for hematological malignancies, have demonstrated extremely severe T-cell lymphopenia that extended all throughout the 1st year [31, 32], as a risk factor for severe disease, which is in accordance with previous observations for other viral infections such as CMV [33]. In our study, mortality from LRTD was relatively low and 16% died of any cause within 60 days from diagnosis of CARV infection. Usually occurred in the presence of aggressive co-pathogens (10/17 deaths). However, we could not provide evidence in the multivariate analysis that CARV LRTD with bacterial co-infections displayed a negative effect in mortality. In addition, we were not able to provide evidence of the clinical usefulness of the ISI score in predicting mortality in multivariate analysis in the CARV and LRTD CARV cohorts in the setting of UCBT.",
