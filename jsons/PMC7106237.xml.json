Currently, coronaviruses are classified into three genuses based on antigenic and genetic relatedness. The first to be discovered was infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV), which is a Gamma coronavirus (de Groot et al., 2008). IBV is a major poultry pathogen, and is probably endemic in all regions with intensive poultry production. All IBV strains are capable of infecting a large range of epithelial surfaces of the chicken. Different isolates vary in their ability to replicate in non-respiratory tissues, with some producing clinical disease in non-respiratory tissues, most notably the kidney and proventriculus (Liu et al., 2006a, Yu et al., 2001). The IBV genome is an approximately 27.6-kb single-stranded positive RNA molecule that encodes four structural proteins, spike (S), membrane (M), small membrane (E), and nucleoprotein (N). In addition, the genome also encodes the replicase complex that carries out the unique discontinuous transcription process that results in a nested set of six 3\u2032 coterminal subgenomic mRNAs (Stern and Kennedy, 1980, Stern et al., 1982).",

            "text": "At least three major factors contribute to the genetic diversity of coronaviruses. First, the inaccuracy of the coronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase makes the mutation rate approximately 1 per 1000\u201310,000 nucleotides replicated, making the viral genome particularly plastic (Duffy et al., 2008, Jenkins et al., 2002). Second, coronaviruses undergo a high frequency of homologous RNA recombination as a result of their possible unique random template switching during RNA replication (Lai, 1992, Pasternak et al., 2006). Third, the largest coronavirus genomes (26.4\u201331.7 kb) give this viral family extra flexibility to accommodate and modify genes (Masters, 2006). These three factors have not only led to a diversity of strains and genotypes from one coronavirus species, but also generated new species that can adapt to new hosts and ecological niches (Woo et al., 2006). IBV strains are also continuously evolving through point mutations, insertions, deletions and genome recombination, leading to emergence of new IBV serotypes or variants (Cavanagh et al., 1992a). Many variants are better adapted or show increased virulence in IB outbreaks. The design of appropriate control programs has been complicated by the large number of IBV sero- or genotypes that have been identified worldwide (Cavanagh, 2007), and the low degree of cross-protection observed among IBV serotypes (Cowen and Hitchner, 1975).",

Since the original identifications, many strains of IBV have been isolated in China, and IB is one of the major infectious diseases of poultry farms. These findings indicate the need for in-depth studies to determine epidemiological conditions, and to improve the efficacy of vaccination and control programs.

For virus isolation, samples of tissue were pooled and 10% weight/volume tissue suspensions were made in 0.1% phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 100 \u03bcg penicillin and 100 \u03bcg streptomycin/ml. After 12 h at 4 \u00b0C, 200 \u03bcl of suspension supernatant was inoculated into the allantoic cavity of 9-day-old to 11-day-old SPF embryos. Each sample was used to inoculate three to five eggs, which were incubated at 37 \u00b0C and candled daily. One to five blind passages were performed until between 2 and 7 days after inoculation, when characteristic embryo changes such as the dwarfing, stunting, or curling of embryos were observed (Liu et al., 2006b).

To increase our insight into the comprehensive epidemiological situation and evolutionary process of IBV in China, we analyzed the S1 genes of all 174 Chinese IBV isolates with sequence information deposited in GenBank since 1995. Our phylogenetic analysis of S1 glycoprotein genes revealed that Chinese IBV strains could be at least classified into nine genetic groups. In addition, 13 IBV variants were also found to be circulating in vaccinated chicken flocks in recent years, which complicates the IBV epidemiology in China. Interestingly, we found that more than 50% of Chinese IBV strains were LX4-type, consistent with previous results (Liu and Kong, 2004, Liu et al., 2009a). LX4-type IBVs were first isolated in 1999 (Liu and Kong, 2004) and later found to be the predominant IBV type circulating in both laying hens and broilers in China (Liu et al., 2006b, Liu et al., 2009a). Recently, this type was reported to be one of the most important in Russia and other European countries (Bochkov et al., 2006, Dolz et al., 2008, Domanska-Blicharz et al., 2006, Gough et al., 2008, Worthington and Jones, 2006). The S1 gene of LX4-type strains showed slight variability among isolates obtained between 1995 and 2009 in China, suggesting that genetic change might not be a constant feature of IBV strains, as it is among mammalian coronaviruses (Masters, 2006). Nonetheless, we found some mutations, insertions and deletions in the S1 gene among LX4-type strains (Fig. 3). This opens the possibility that different LX4-type IBV strains evolved independently in different regions under various field conditions, although it is still possible that these viruses have same origin. Most of the isolates came from flocks vaccinated with Mass-type vaccines, which implies insufficient protection against the field strains. The poor relationship between the Chinese LX4-type field isolates and the Mass-type vaccine strains (average amino acid identity of 78%) could explain the failure of the Mass-type vaccination programs to control IBV in these flocks. Indeed, a cross-protection analysis between the LX4 and Mass-type H120 vaccine strains established this failure. Because of the large amounts of LX4-type IBV isolated in various parts of China, and the possibility of different virulence from different IBVs (Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008), the pathogenicity of newly emerged viruses and cross-protection from Mass-type vaccines must be reevaluated.",

Approximately 20 emergent types in North America have not spread to other continents. Similarly, the European, Australian, and Asiatic types of IBVs, have apparently not spread. This is the case for the CK/CH/LSC/99I-type IBV in this study. Almost all IBV strains isolated from Sichuan province (including isolates from Chongqing City) were CK/CH/LSC/99I-type. Sichuan is one of the provinces with a high density of chicken farms in China, so this result is significant for vaccination programs in this region. In contrast, other types of IBV strains were found to co-circulate in China. The spreading of a virus from one area to another could be due, at least in part, by the illegal trading of chickens or by the use of attenuated vaccines. Recently, wild birds have been of concern as natural IBV carriers, since infected birds carry the viruses from one area to another (Cavanagh, 2007, Liu et al., 2005, Shimazaki et al., 2009, Sun et al., 2007).",

This isolate seems to have high affinity for the proventriculus of chicken and is implicated in a novel pathogenicity associated with transmissible proventriculitis (Yu et al., 2001), even though few experimental proventriculitis models have been generated using this IBV. The CK/CH/LDL/97I-type IBV is associated with IB outbreaks from 1997 to 2001 in Liaotung Peninsula (Liu et al., 2009c, Yu et al., 2001). In this study, a CK/CH/LDL/97I-type IBV isolate, ck/CH/LSD/08-10, was isolated from the trachea of a H120-immunized broiler in Shandong Province. Interestingly, unlike other CK/CH/LDL/97I-type strains, ck/CH/LSD/08-10-infected chickens did not show proventriculitis under field conditions. Importantly, this type of IBV has been isolated again in immunized chicken flocks after it \u201cdisappeared\u201d for 7 years. Furthermore, the pathogenicity and tissue tropism of ck/CH/LSD/08-10 appears to have changed under field conditions (Liu et al., 2009c, Yu et al., 2001).

            "text": "The third major type of IBV circulating in China is Mass-type, which is a pandemic type that is frequently isolated from chicken flocks in China, even those vaccinated with H120 or other Mass-type vaccines. This also occurs in other countries (Dolz et al., 2008, Rimondi et al., 2009, Roussan et al., 2009) and is expected, because vaccine strain re-isolation is possible when extensive vaccination programs use attenuated strains. However, vaccination is not likely to be the only possibility for Mass-type virus circulation in China. In this study, even though S1 nucleotide and amino acid identities were greater than 95% among Mass-type isolates, and between isolates and vaccine strains, sequence comparison and analysis showed discrepancies in the S1 genes for most of the isolates and vaccine strains. Hence, circulation between field Mass-type isolates in vaccinated and non-vaccinated chickens flocks cannot be excluded and may indicate a vaccination failure in these flocks. Alternatively, molecular studies have shown that only a few changes in S1 spike protein amino acid composition can result in immune failure, even when the majority of the virus genome remains unchanged (Cavanagh et al., 1992b). Amino acid changes may result from immunological pressure caused by the widespread use of vaccines (Cavanagh et al., 2005) and recombination after mixed infections, which allows other field strains to emerge. In this study, we found four IBV strains (BJ9601, SD/97/01, ck/CH/LHLJ/07II and ck/CH/LHLJ/08II) with an amino acid substitution at position 63 of the S1 subunit of the S protein that resulted in escape mutants (Cavanagh et al., 1988).",

IBV strains of the 4/91-type, which are also known as 793/B, were first reported and characterized in Britain in 1991 (Adzhar et al., 1997, Gough et al., 2008). Both viral and serological surveys have shown that the 4/91-type has become one of the predominant European types, with high incidences of infection in layer and broiler chickens worldwide (Capua et al., 1999, Cavanagh et al., 2005, Cook et al., 1996, Dolz et al., 2008, Gough et al., 1992, Meulemans et al., 2001, Roussan et al., 2009, Worthington et al., 2008). In this study, we found that TA03 had low sequence similarity to the Japanese 4/91 field strain (Shimazaki et al., 2008), indicating minimal likelihood that TA03 originated in Japan. In contrast, TA03 showed close relationship with 4/91 European strains, and is more closely related to the pathogenic strain than the vaccine strain. Three amino acids at positions 95, 508 and 530 were different between a UK/4/91 field isolate (4/91 pathogenic) and its embryo-passaged, attenuated derivative (4/91 vaccine) (Cavanagh et al., 2005). Interestingly, TA03 shared the same three amino acids with the 4/91 pathogenic strain, even though these changes are not associated with pathogenicity (Shimazaki et al., 2009). It has been suggested that replication of 4/91 strains in chickens and embryonated eggs is associated with position 95, particularly alanine in the vaccine strain and serine in the chick-passaged strain (Cavanagh et al., 2005). For TA03, amino acid 95 was serine, the same as the chick-passaged isolate. These results might suggest that TA03 has adapted to propagate in chickens. However, we cannot conclude that IBV TA03 is not associated with the 4/91 vaccine. The background of the commercial chickens from which TA03 was isolated and the pathogenicity of TA03 strain was unclear. Hence, the origin of the Chinese 4/91-type isolates, especially their relation to the vaccine strain, requires further investigation.",

Alignment and comparison of S1 gene suggested that recombination events associated with 4/91 might have been involved in the origin and evolution of Chinese local IBV strains W118 and CK/CH/LGD/04III. Because TA03, W118 and CK/CH/LGD/04III were isolated from different regions, and the challenges created by these types of viruses might be substantial. Hence, a dynamic investigation of the prevalence of the 4/91-type virus is necessary for a deeper understanding of its evolution and epidemiology in China.",

In this study, using comparison of S1 genes, we discovered 13 IBV variants from 1995 to 2009. Nearly all had unique deletion and insertion patterns in S1, especially in the hypervariable regions (Fig. 3), indicating possible different origins for these strains. From S1 gene sequence analysis, we hypothesized that some originated from recombination events between local IBVs, and between local and vaccine strains, indicating that the widespread use of live virus vaccines may contribute to the origin and genetic evolution of IBV. However, because of limited background information, the exact origin of most of the IBV variants is still unclear. Predicting the origin of these IBV variants using whole genome sequence analysis might provide more information.",

Similar mortalities were also observed after inoculating 15-day-old SPF chickens with the two Chinese IBV isolates (Table 2), comparing the outcome to other nephropathogenic IBV isolates (Li and Yang, 2001, Liu et al., 2009a).

            "text": "Although genotyping based on the S1 gene has been useful for determining the epidemiology of field IBVs, and for predicting the effectiveness of vaccines against field isolates, vaccination-challenge is the only way to establish the actual protective potential of a given vaccine strain for a field isolate (Hofstad, 1981). Only the Mass-type vaccine is officially authorized in China, so its protection against heterologous isolates must be evaluated. In this study, we determined the ability of the H120 vaccine to protect against two IBV variants, ck/CH/LHB/08I and ck/CH/LAH/08II, in a vaccination-challenge test. Vaccination reduced, and in many cases prevented, replication of ck/CH/LAH/08II in lung, kidney, caecal tonsil, and the respiratory tract. However, H120 vaccination did not provide respiratory protection against ck/CH/LHB/08I, since virus was recovered from 100% of the respiratory tracts of ck/CH/LHB/08I-challenged chickens. ck/CH/LHB/08I could be a exceptionally virulent strain for chickens. Nonetheless, according to the Pharmacopoeia's reference standards depending on the country (de Wit et al., 1998, Liu et al., 2006b, Terregino et al., 2008), H120 shows low effectiveness against ck/CH/LHB/08I and ck/CH/LAH/08II. The protection is especially poor since IBV infection of very young layer hens can produce permanent damage to the genital tract that is evident only several weeks after infection, when the birds come into lay and show reduced egg production and quality (Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008), or an increased incidence of false layers is observed in the flock. Vaccination with only Mass-type vaccines does not appear to provide enough protection against various IBV types and the variants indigenous to China (Liu et al., 2006b, Liu et al., 2008a, Liu et al., 2009c). The results presented here are additional evidence for the poor protection against challenge with a heterologous IBV strain. Although vaccination with various types of vaccines may improve protection efficacy (Terregino et al., 2008), the Mass-type vaccine is the only vaccine officially authorized in China, suggesting a vaccine from Chinese local IBV strains should be developed and IB control programs in China should be adjusted.",

In conclusion, the detailed epidemiological information in this work is of significance for vaccination programs in China. Dynamic surveillance of IBV is important, even though the complicated epidemiology of the multiple IBV types and variants co-circulating in any specific region in China makes designing molecular diagnostic techniques difficult.
