Telemedicine is feasible and acceptable for use in HIV-infected persons and is an effective way to expand HIV care, particularly in rural or remote settings [6, 7] and among hard-to-reach populations, such as those who are incarcerated [8]. Telemedicine can reduce transportation barriers in urban areas, including traffic, long travel distances, or limited access to transportation; and, improve engagement in care and medication adherence, resulting in reduced HIV viral load [6, 8]. Telemedicine can also allow providers to increase patient volume providing access to care for more patients [6, 9]. Telemedicine also has the potential to extend the reach of LGBTQ-affirming care more broadly, particularly for those who are less likely to seek in-person care because of concerns about disclosure, stigma or parental notification [10]. Despite a robust and growing evidence base for telemedicine for HIV care, telemedicine has not previously been scaled for HIV care in most settings. However, the COVID-19 crisis has prompted more widespread adoption of telemedicine, including for HIV prevention and care visits. In this paper, we review a new LGBTQ + clinic\u2019s transition to telemedicine and implications for providing HIV prevention and care services via telemedicine during COVID-19.",

Patients complete pre-appointment paperwork in the electronic medical record patient portal; this includes consent forms, demographic information, and social and medical histories. Providers conduct encounters as they would in office, but substitute physical exams with visual assessments, patient self-exams and self-collected vital signs. Patients also submit pictures via an encrypted email connection if images are required for assessment or treatment. Telephone-based encounters are similar but exclude visual assessments.

All respondents identified as a sexual minority, and 32% were transgender or non-binary. Over 75% reported interest in telemedicine outside of the COVID-19 pandemic. Approximately 25% of respondents reported interest in receiving HIV care via telemedicine, and 50% of patients were interested in STI screening and treatment.",
