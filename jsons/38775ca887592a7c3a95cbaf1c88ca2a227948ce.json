Following primary antibodies were used and diluted 35 1/1000 in TBS-T with 5% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich, Stockholm, Sweden): pMLKL (abcam#196436), 36 cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, USA, #9664), cleaved PARP (Cell Signaling, Beverly, 37 USA #9544), caspase-8 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, USA #8592), RIP3 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, USA 38 #15828), and GAPDH (Cell Signaling, Beverly, USA #5174). Membranes were incubated with 39 primary antibodies at 4 C\u00b0. Membranes where then washed in TBS-T with 5% milk or 5% BSA, 40 for 2x 15 minutes and then washed in TBS-T for additional 15 minutes. Anti-rabbit secondary 41 antibodies #31460 (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, USA) or anti-rabbit # 7074 (Cell Signaling, 42 Beverly, USA) conjugated to HRP were directed towards primary antibodies and incubated for 1 43 hour. pMLKL were stripped for RIP3 and caspase-8 with western blot stripping buffer (Thermo 44 Scientific, Waltham, USA). Proteins were visualized with West Femto SuperSignal detection kit 45 (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, USA) and optical density from the bands was detected by using LI-46 COR odyssey Fc imager system (LI-COR, Lincoln, USA). Ratio of optical band density between 47 samples and GAPDH were calculated in Microsoft Excel and normalized towards saline or wild-48 type HDM/dsRNA. The mean of the normalized optical density are presented. 49 50 TUNEL staining 51 In situ cell death detection kit fluorescein (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) was used for TUNEL 52 analysis. Sections were deparaffinized and gradually rehydrated. Antigen-retrieval was performed 53 by addition of 20 \u00b5L of 20 mg/ml proteinase K (Sigma-Aldrich, Stockholm, Sweden) during 20 54 minutes at 37 o C. TUNEL mixture was then added to all sections and incubated 1 hour at 37 o C. Study Design. 85 Mice were challenged with 25 \u00b5g HDM or saline intranasally 3 times/week for 3 86 weeks.
