We introduced the pooling of samples before RT-PCR amplification, and only in the case of positive pool test results is work-up of individual samples initiated, thus potentially substantially reducing the number of tests needed.",

Ct values were lower in retested positive individual samples (figure A, B\n). The Ct values for both E-gene and S-gene assays in pools and individual positive samples were below 30 and easily categorised as positive. Ct value differences between pooled tests and individual positive samples (Ctpool\u2013 Ctpositive sample) were in the range of up to five. Even if Ct values of single samples were up to 34, positive pools could still be confidently identified (figure C, D). Sub-pools can further optimise resource use when infection prevalence is low. Generating a pool of 30 samples from three sub-pools of ten samples can reduce retestings. If the large pool is positive, the three sub-pools are reanalysed, and then the individual samples of the positive sub-pool. In our analyses during March 13\u201321, 2020, testing of 1191 samples required only 267 tests to detect 23 positive individuals (prevalence 1\u00b793%). The rate of positive tests was 4\u00b724% in our institution during this period.",

Absolute Ct values were below 30 for all pool sizes. Three positive individual samples with Ct values greater than 30 were spiked into negative pools of 30 samples and tested with E-gene (C) and S-gene (D) assays. We hypothesise that the lower Ct values of pools than of single samples were because of the carrier effect of the higher RNA content in pools.
