Design: A detailed search of the literature, 32 using Google Scholar, PubMED, MedRxiv and BioRxiv, was conducted for the time period 01-33 DEC-2019 to 04-MAY-2020; using appropriate keywords: resultant articles were scrutinised 34 in detail, and appraised for reported data pertaining to hospitalization and hospital length of 35 stay (LOS). Results: Disease presentation was described in China; 81 % mild, 14 % moderate 36 and 5 % severe. The experience, thus far, in Europe and the USA are suggestive of a higher 37 degree of severity. Initial reports suggest high hospitalisation and ICU admittance rates.",

Perhaps the relative age, the level 39 of pre-existing conditions, and other health factors may be contributors to differences. Data 40 from Irish cases suggest hospitalisation rate may be lower in parts of Europe and time 41 dependent. Hospital LOS is described in seventeen articles, with median lengths of stay 42 between 4 and 25 days. The evidence regarding the LOS in ICU is reported in eighteen 43 studies, fifteen deemed relevant. The majority of studies report ICU LOS between 7 to 10 44 days. Many of these studies are likely skewed towards shorter stay due to study cut-off 45 dates. Indications based on ICU LOS reported for patients continuing care suggest median 46 ICU stay will be longer. Conclusions: These parameter estimates are key to the development 47 of an effective health care resource model. Based on our rapid appraisal of the literature, is 48 it essential that Europe manages mitigation measures to ensure that hospital and ICU 49 capacity does not become overwhelmed to manage this pandemic long term.",

Many of these reports indicate a 444 median ICU length of stay between 7 to 10 days; however a number of these studies report 445 length of stay based only on resolved cases, and as such duration of stay it is likely skewed 446 towards a short stay due to bias towards those who have completed their ICU stay and are 447 now discharged or have died. Thus the upper estimates of the range should be considered 448 for use in resource models.

A Swiss study, too, 380 outlined the median length of stay was 9 days for 41 patients followed to discharge (Ceruti 381 et al., 2020).

Another shortcoming was some of the 420 available literature is in pre-print form and only undergoing peer review. the severity of case presentations have been described between continents; 424 and Ireland should base its expectation on those cases observed in Europe thus far in the 425 pandemic. Advice from the ECDC suggests hospitalisation rates of up to 42 % can be 426 expected. Additionally, we must expect increased level of care requirements, to critical care 427 and ICU levels, in up to 3 % of cases to allow for spare capacity, as mitigation measures are 428 relaxed in our jurisdiction. There is no doubt that the case definition in use and the 429 availability of community testing will determine the hospitalisation rate within a country.

Admission rates to ICU in the USA varied between 4.9 to 11.5 % (CDC COVID-19 Response Team, 2020) report. Myers et al. (2020) indicated 8.7 % ICU admission in a study conducted 251 in California in March. While Lewnard et al., (2020) observed a higher ICU admission rate 252 (25.6 %) also in California. A number of studies conducted in New York outlined ICU admission rates of 14.2 % (Richards et al., 2020); 22 % (Cummings et al., 2020); 23.6 % 254 (Argenizano et al., 2020); and 36% (Paranjpe et al., 2020). Of significance, are the mortality 255 rates in hospitalised groups (and specifically not ICU only groups) reported in a number of US 256 studies: 15.4 % Lewnard et al., (2020); 15.6 % Myers et al., 2020; 21 %; Richards et al., 2020; 21 %; Argenziano et al., 2020; and 29 % Paranjpe et al 2020.",

Nevertheless, the experience, thus far, in Europe and the USA would suggest some countries are experiencing a higher degree of severity of COVID-19 being reported. Early indications from Italy suggested hospitalisation rates of 30 % and admission to ICU between 16 to 18 %(Cereda et al., 2020;Graselli et al., 2020).

Indeed earlier reports from INCARC 392 (2020b) reported shorter LOS of ICU patients, as fewer persons had progressed through to completion of treatment. It is evident that study cutoff, and short follow ups, have influenced reported ICU LOS; it is clear that the influence of continuing care groups will lengthen length of ICU stay somewhat in time.",
