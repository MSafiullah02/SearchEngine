Accordingly, 1.83-m (6-feet) social 3 distancing is advised to reduce the spread of the disease among humans. This is based on the 4 assumption that no air circulation exists around people. However, it is not well investigated 5 whether the ambient wind and relative humidity (RH) will cause SARS-CoV-2 laden droplets to 6 transport farther in the air, making the current social distancing policy insufficient. To provide 7 evidence and insight into the \"social distancing\" guidelines, a validated computational fluid-8 particle dynamics (CFPD) model was employed to simulate the transient transport, 9 condensation/evaporation, and deposition of SARS-CoV-2 laden droplets emitted by coughs, 10 with different environmental wind velocities and RHs. Initial droplet diameters range from 2 to 11 2000 \u00b5m, and the wind velocities range from 0 to 16 km/h, representing different wind forces 12 from calm air to moderate breeze. The comparison between a steady-state wind and a gust with a 13 constant frequency has also been performed. Ambient RHs are 40% and 99.5%.

High RH will 21 increase the droplet sizes due to the hygroscopic growth effect, which increases the deposition 22 fractions on both humans and the ground. With the complex environmental wind and RH 23 conditions, the 6-feet social distancing policy may not be sufficient to protect the inter-person 24 aerosol transmission, since the suspending micro-droplets were influenced by convection effects 25 and can be transported from the human coughs/sneezes to the other human in less than 5 seconds.",

            "text": "As the world faces a large outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, the 2 airborne transmission risk of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS- 3 CoV-2) was first confirmed by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of 4 China (J. Wang & Du, 2020) , and then by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 5 Although the virus diameter of SARS-CoV-2 is from 50 to 200 nm (Guzman, 2020) , it has been 6 confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 spreads through inhalation or ingestions of droplets they 7 contaminate. As a result, coughing, sneezing, and touching infected surfaces are primary sources 8 of infection. As a cellular entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 (H. Zhang, Penninger, Li, Zhong, & 9 Slutsky, 2020), Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE-2) are abundantly present in humans in 10 the epithelia of the lung and small intestine, as well as present in mucosae (mouth and nose) or 11 conjunctiva (eyes). Therefore, it is critical to prevent the SARS-CoV-2 laden droplets from 12 reaching the respiratory systems or the eyes. To slow the spread of COVID-19 via airborne 13 transmission, a \"social distancing\" policy of approximately 1.83 m (6 feet) is recommended. 14 However, this social distance is defined with static ambient air which is not realistic, and also 15 neglects the effect of relative humidity (Drossinos & Stilianakis, 2020) . In addition, it is often 16 assumed that most of the respiratory droplets fall and reach the floor. However, emitted micro- 17 droplets have low Stokes numbers (Finlay, 2001) , which can be significantly influenced by the 18 convection of ambient airflow and transport much farther than 1.83 m. Such an unknown effect 19 increases the complexity of social distancing policy making and may pose potential risks to 20 people in contact with the airborne SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, it is necessary to systematically 21 investigate how the ambient wind and relative humidity can influence the air transmission of 22 SARS-CoV-2-laden droplets generated by coughs from a COVID-19 positive patient to a healthy 23 human subject standing farther than 1.83 (6 feet) away. Such research is also crucial because 24 visualizing the airborne transmission of the SARS-CoV-2-laden droplets between humans to 25 inform people to be aware of the importance to personal protection equipment (PPE), and to be 26 responsible for helping reduce the spread of the virus to protect susceptible population groups, 27 i.e., seniors with underlying conditions such as influenza, cystic fibrosis, and diabetes. 28 Supported by benchmark experimental data from cough aerosol characterizations (Bourouiba, 33 done to either characterize cough aerosol clouds or simulate aerosol transport phenomena in both 34 indoor and outdoor environments. However, most of the numerical studies, either using Euler- 35 Euler or Euler-Lagrange based models, neglected the condensation and evaporation of the cough 36 droplets, which may limit the validity of droplet trajectory predictions. Based on our literature employed a single virtual human, and did not investigate potential exposure health risks to the 5 cough droplets for a second virtual human nearby. 6 This study employed a well-validated computational fluid-particle dynamics (CFPD) model (X. size changes due to condensation and evaporation to simulate SARS-CoV-2-laden droplets 11 transmission between two virtual humans, quantify the wind and relative humidity effects on the 12 droplet deposition on the human body and head region, and provide guidance on fine-tuning the 13 social distancing policy based on environmental parameters. Specifically, using benchmark data 14 of cough aerosol characterizations (Duguid, 1946 This study provides aerosol transmission dynamics simulations on understanding the basic 25 aerosol science of SARS-CoV-2-laden droplets spread through the air. The research is significant 26 since it will benefit the research community and regulatory agencies, with the potential to 27 enhance the fundamental understanding of how environmental and human factors can influence 28 the airborne viral transmission from person to person. The insight and quantitative exposure data 29 of the head region and the human body will provide direct evidence for prevention guidance to 30 reduce exposure and infection risks. This study can also be extended to provide high-resolution 31 virus-laden droplet transport and deposition predictions in human respiratory systems with 32 different social distancing paradigms, and to estimate the SARS-CoV-2 RNA load in the airways 33 for further understanding of the viral infection, replication, and pathogenesis noninvasively in the ",

It can be observed that large droplets 5 move faster and stay more concentrated than small droplets. This is because large droplets have 6 relatively high Stokes number, indicating the less dominant effect of viscous dissipation forces 7 acting on them. Therefore, they are more \"capable\" of keeping their initial trajectories. In 8 contrast, with the larger surface area to volume ratio, small droplets lose their initial momentum 9 and kinetic energy quickly due to the viscous dissipation effect from the drag force mainly. Thus, Accordingly, Figures 8 and 9 show the local deposition patterns and regional deposition Therefore, it is necessary to avoid body contact with others before changing clothes and washing 8 hands after possible exposure. 9 Because of the discrepancies of RH and wind influences on the depositions between large and 10 small droplets, regional deposition fractions (DFs) are calculated and shown in Figs. 9 (a)-(d) .

Since Figures 8 and 9 have demonstrated that L sd =1.83 m (6 feet) cannot sufficiently protect the 2 healthy virtual human from exposure of the cough droplets with ambient winds, it is beneficial to 3 investigate whether a longer L sd will be a better standard to be used for the social distancing 4 policy. Therefore, two additional simulations with L sd =3.05 m (10 feet) and RH=99.5% were 5 done with two different wind conditions, i.e., steady-state moderate breeze V in =5.5 m/s, and a 6 transient gust with a waveform of V in shown in Fig. 11 (a) . Droplet deposition patterns and 7 transport of the two 10-feet cases are visualized in Fig. 11 (b)-(f), and compared with the 6-feet 8 case with the same RH and wind velocity (see Figs. 7 (a)-(d) and Fig. 8 (c) ). 9 With the steady-state V in =5.5 m/s, the comparison between Fig. 8 (c) and Fig. 11 (b) shows that ",

            "text": "Another evidence can be found by the deposition pattern differences shown in between 16 Fig. 8 (c) and Fig. 11 (b) . No large droplets deposit on the human who coughs in Fig. 11 (b) than 17 Fig. 8 (c) , indicating that no large droplets moved backward in the 3.05 m cases. The other 18 groups of large droplets in red are dominated by the gravitational sedimentation and deposit on 19 the ground due to the larger L sd =3.05 m (see Fig. 8 (c) and Fig. 11 (b) ). In contrast, 20 microdroplets in blue will still be able to follow the mainstream and transport to the head region 30 it is interesting to find that the gust condition was able to convect the cough droplets faster 31 towards the healthy human direction than the steady-state wind condition. The gust also leads to 32 higher deposition on the healthy human and no deposition on the human who coughs (see Fig. 11 33 (b)). The difference in droplet transport and deposition between the steady-state wind and the 34 gust is due to the difference in the recirculating flow patterns between the two virtual humans. 35 Specifically, the interval gust condition will not generate the quasi-steady-state recirculations, 36 which lead to the faster transport of the droplets towards the downstream direction. Without 37 moving upstream, no droplets deposited on the human who coughs, and more droplets 38 transported downstream and deposited on the healthy human. Thus, with the same peak wind 39 velocities, the gust enhances the exposure risk of the healthy human compared to the steady-state 40 wind condition. To further investigate the effect of facial covering, a virtual N95 filtering facepiece respirator 2 (FFR) was reconstructed and positioned close to the virtual human who coughs (see Fig. 12 (a) ). 3 The average gap between the face contour and the edge of the N95 mask was intentionally 4 exaggerated to approximately 1.8 cm, mimicking the worst scenario with the inappropriate mask 5 seal. Employing the realistic filtration efficiencies as a function of particle diameter (see Fig. 12 6 (b)), a customized C code was programmed to reflect the probabilities of particle trapping 7 accurately when the cough droplets enter the N95 mask which is assumed to be a porous media 8 region. For example, when entering the N95 mask region, the C code will generate a random 9 number between 0 and 1 for each particle. If the random number is lower than the filtration 10 efficiency for the specific particle diameter, then the particle will be assigned a velocity equal to 11 zero, which indicates it has been captured by the mask. For the computational domain of the N95 12 mask, the porosity is 0.88, and the viscous resistance coefficient is 1.12e10 m -2 , which is based cannot be captured by the mask, the total number of the cough droplets transport in the air is 19 significantly lower than the case without the mask (see Fig. 7) . With the mask, airborne droplets 20 are all relatively small, and entering the airflow is slightly delayed. However, those small 21 droplets can still follow the mainstream airflow streamlines (see Fig. 1 (c) ) and reach the healthy 22 virtual human on the right. Thus, it can be concluded that even if wearing facial masks without 23 the proper seal with the face can significantly reduce the airborne transmission of cough droplets. 24 It is recommended that people can wear facial coverings with minimized gaps with their faces.

Furthermore, high-velocity flows exist outside of the wake flow formed 8 downstream to the human who coughs (left inFig. 1), which can be both observed from the 9 velocity contours at planes X=0 and Y=0.

With V in increases from 0 to 5.5 m/s, 24 the convection due to the ambient wind becomes more dominant to small droplets. This can be 25 proved by the smaller distance between the frontier of the droplet cloud and the healthy human to 26 the right in the figures with V in increases. It is interesting to see that larger droplets are not 27 affected by the enhanced wind velocity when V in <5.5 m/s. Specifically, the large droplets in 28 gray color, all traveled approximately 1.81 m at t=0.5 s in Figs. 4 (a)-(f). Such an observation 29 indicates that those the inertia and gravitational sedimentation are dominant for those large 30 droplets. The exceptions are shown in Figs. 4 (g) and (h). The enhanced localized turbulence 31 intensity and airflow momentum in the recirculation zones between the two virtual humans, 32 larger droplets are influenced and moved back towards the left human who coughs. Indeed, With 33 high wind velocity entering the computational domain, the local airflow velocities in the 34 recirculation zone have higher magnitude and higher turbulence intensity. Therefore, the 35 convection effect is more dominant so that it can influence the larger droplets and conquer their 36 inertia, forcing them to follow the backward recirculation flow. Such trajectories led to the 37 deposition patterns of the droplets in gray color shown in Figs. 8 (c) and (d). Moreover, the RH 38 effect on the droplet size change dynamics is noticeable. Droplet sizes in cases with RH=99.5% 39 (see Figs. 4 (a), (c), (e) and (g)) are larger than the cases with RH=40% (see Figs.
