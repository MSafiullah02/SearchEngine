IBV is a member of the genus Gammacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae and is an important viral pathogen in the poultry industry. It causes a highly contagious disease in chickens, mainly affecting the respiratory and reproductive tract [1] . The mechanisms involved in IBV pathogenesis and the host's response are still not fully understood. The pathogenicity of the virus has been linked to the activation of apoptosis, the inhibition of innate antiviral immunity, and the induction of proinflammatory cytokine production [2, 3] . However, the specific factors facilitating these processes, and the way IBV influences them for the benefit of either the virus or the host remain to be identified. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules with a typical size of about 22 nucleotides (nt). They are implicated in numerous cellular processes, including viral infections. Several members of the family Coronaviridae have been shown to modulate the host miRNA repertoire, thereby influencing viral pathogenesis [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Coronavirus-induced miRNAs have been suggested to modulate the host's antiviral immune responses including viral sensing [5] , cytokine secretion [4, [7] [8] [9] , and T-cell-mediated cell killing [7] . For IBV, the production of a number of miRNAs have been described to be influenced in chicken kidneys upon infection with IBV strains with different nephropathogenicity [10] .

Twelve of the 14 identified DE miRNAs with a common predicted target gene clustered in four specific chromosomal regions as pairs or groups of three, suggesting a shared mechanism for their deregulation and strengthening the likelihood of their involvement in IBV infection. Notably, four of the five predicted target genes that were analyzed were downregulated in the spleen, indicating that the identified miRNAs are functional. In contrast, in the lungs, none of the predicted target genes were affected, despite the presence of viral RNA. Theoretically, immunerelated genes should be affected to a larger extent in organs with an important immune function. Furthermore, the number of affected miRNAs and miRNA clusters was higher in the spleen than in the lungs (17 versus five DE miRNAs, and four versus one cluster), suggesting that widespread host miRNA modulation occurs in the spleen. However, an effect in the lungs at a different time point cannot be ruled out. As primary immune responses against virus infections often take days to fully develop, especially adaptive antiviral immune responses including lymphocyte expansion and activation, it could be worthwhile to examine the modulation of immune-related target genes at later time points.
