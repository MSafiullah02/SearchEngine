The case numbers up to April 5 can be found in the supplemental data (Appendix A). As at the point of writing this brief, the dataset contains 39 time-series data points. For forecasting purposes, earlier days with zero incidences of COVID-19 were filtered for building the forecast models. This is presented in tabular form in Table 1\n-2\nand visual form in Fig. 1\nwhile the number of new cases per day is shown in Fig. 2\n. Seven successive daily forecasts by the ensemble, starting from March 29, 2020, to April 5, 2020, are presented in Table 3\n. The autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation behavior of the dataset of Fig. 3\naids in developing ARIMA modeling insights. Similarly, Fig. 4\nis a visualization of the forecast beams indicating the direction and strength of increases or decreases in the forecasted number of cases. Table 4\nhighlights the relative strength and weaknesses of the models individually and finally; Fig. 5\npresents a visual comparison of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria vs South Africa for analyzing policy impact.",

The objective is to establish the lower and upper bounds on the possible number of COVID-19 cases per day using a framework that automatically streams web data in real-time from reliable sources. This data is used for retraining and adapting the parameters of an ensemble of three models which in turn updates its forecast prediction for the following day. Each of the three models provides an estimated lower bound and upper bound for the number of cases. The Ensemble forecast is achieved by taking the minimum of the lower bounds and the maximum of the upper bounds. Due to limited sources of data (the only available information is a single variable, \u201cnumber of COVID-19 cases per day\u201d), it makes it difficult to implement specialized, advanced, and more generalizable methods that often require a variety of features and bigger datasets. It is also important to highlight that there are only a few samples (22) in the dataset making it equally challenging to apply nonparametric neural models.",

Unfortunately, information about the number of tests carried out per day and other factors are not readily available. This leaves us with only one variable: the total number of cases. In the same vein, Wikipedia maintains a data table of the number of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria with values updated using information from NCDC as well as other reliable verified news and media outlets. Surprisingly, even under data and information constraints, bounds on our ensemble forecast has been able to accurately capture the daily total number of cases from March 29, 2020, to April 5, 2020 (Tables 1&2; Figures 1&2).

The ARIMA model is a generalization of many sub-models and characterized by three parameters: order of autoregressive observations p, degree of differencing d, and number of moving average terms q. The foundations of ARIMA lie on the fact that nonstationary time-series can be made stationary by through differencing. The verification of stationarity can be achieved using autocorrelation plots and unit root tests such as the Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) test [3]. For this model, we are interested in non-seasonal phenomena. Using brute search and inspection of the autocorrelation function ACF and partial autocorrelation function PACF plots (Figure 3), an ARIMA (2,1,0) model was chosen.",

It has strengths in dealing with strong seasonal effects, missing data, outliers, and shifts in trend making it fully automatic. It is also implemented with a Stan backend which introduces a fast solution to L-BFGS (Limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shannon algorithm) for the forecasting problem. Prophet includes a decomposable time series model defined by:y(t)=g(t)+s(t)+h(t)+\u03b5(t)\ng(t) is the trend, s(t) represents seasonal changes and h(t) captures irregular effects. We elicit trend characteristics g(t) as of primary importance in developing the forecast. The trend model in this work utilizes a piecewise saturated growth model with time-varying carrying capacity defined below:g(t)=C(t)1+exp(\u2212(k+\u03b1(t)\u22ba\u03b4)(t\u2212(m+\u03b1(t)\u22ba\u03b3)))\nC(t) is the time-varying carrying capacity, k is the growth rate, m is an offset.

It has the general form of:y^T+1|T=\u03b1yT+\u03b1(1\u2212\u03b1)yT\u22121+\u03b1(1\u2212\u03b1)2yT\u22122+\u2026Where the values of alpha tune the response of the model. Alpha values close to 0 emphasize past input data, while values close to 1 emphasize recent input data. The Holt-Winters ES algorithm introduces a seasonality component to the vanilla ES. In addition to the ES model, a GARCH model [9] was used to forecast variances and combined with the ES model gives the upper and lower bound for this model",

            "text": "One of the current strategies being deployed for the containment of COVID-19 is the lockdown of regions affected to avoid further spread by human movement. We find evidence that this strategy is effective in the containment of the infection in SA. SA declared a National lockdown on the 26th of March, 2020 [12] to tame the spread of infection. As shown in Figure 5, there was a kink in the progression of confirmed cases on March 27, 2020. The steepness of the curve was relatively flattened and steady for a few days thereafter. The steep upward trend of the infections was stemmed the same day the national lockdown policy was announced. The fact that those that have been infected before the lockdown will be presenting themselves for tests and treatment could have accounted for a slight rise in cases within 2 weeks of lockdown. The full compliance with the policy and number of new cases in post-2-weeks lockdown policy are scenarios that would guide further actions in SA.",
