With nearly half of this age group spending some part of their lives in nursing homes [2], the number of older adults using paid long-term care services is expected to grow substantially over the coming decade [3]. In the U.S. and other high-income countries, gastroenteritis outbreaks are common in nursing homes, skilled nursing facilities and assisted living facilities, which are collectively known as long-term care facilities (LTCFs) [4\u20137]. Despite the perception that norovirus is a foodborne disease or the \u2018cruise ship virus\u2019, the majority of all norovirus outbreaks reported to the CDC occur in LTCFs [6]. While norovirus gastroenteritis is generally mild and self-limiting, older nursing home residents are vulnerable to infection leading to hospitalization and death [8], with the vast majority of norovirus-associated deaths in the U.S. occurring among persons aged 65 years and older [9].",

As a result, rapid implementation of standard control measures is the mainstay for curtailing transmission [13]. Identifying factors associated with norovirus transmission is critical to better understanding disease spread and preventing additional cases. Individual-level risk factors for susceptibility to norovirus infection or severe disease in nursing home outbreaks have been identified, including resident mobility, dependency on staff assistance [14], immunodeficiency [15], and statin use [16]. But because transmission of norovirus from one person to another cannot be directly observed (unlike symptoms and/or positive test results that follow transmission), it remains poorly understood and the evidence base for the value of specific prevention and control measures is lacking [10].",

Individual reproduction numbers (Ri), or the number of secondary cases an individual generates, can then be calculated for all cases. We quantified the contribution of specific symptoms and residents vs. staff in norovirus transmission by examining the associations between these variables and individual case infectivity, which was characterized by Ri. Additionally, we examined how transmission changes over the course of an outbreak. Our overall aim was to inform implementation of effective norovirus prevention and control measures to reduce the size and duration of norovirus outbreaks in nursing homes.

R0 or RE of 1 signifies the extinction threshold, below which each infectious individual, on average, infects less than one other individual and the outbreak cannot be maintained. RE can be converted to R0 by dividing RE by the proportion susceptible in the population.

Here, REi is defined as the number of secondary cases generated by an individual case i. We estimated REi using a maximum likelihood procedure to infer the number of secondary cases generated by each case (S1 RMarkdown File) [17]. This method, originally described by Wallinga and Teunis, requires only onset dates of all cases in the outbreak and knowledge of the probability distribution of the serial interval for the specific infectious disease [17]. We used a serial interval for norovirus derived from several large norovirus outbreaks in child daycare centers in Sweden with a gamma probability distribution, mean of 3.6 days, and standard deviation of 2.0 days [19]. We performed sensitivity analyses with mean serial intervals varying between 1.5 and 4.0 days in half day increments (S2 RMarkdown File). Details of the estimation procedure are available elsewhere [17,19,20]. Briefly, this method uses the difference in symptom onsets dates between cases and the probability distribution of the serial interval to calculate the relative likelihood that cases with earlier symptom onset dates infected cases with later symptom onset dates. The relative likelihoods are then summed to estimate the REi for each case. Individual cases were assigned a REi and corresponding 95% confidence interval based on their symptom onset date, and those with the same onset date within an outbreak were assigned the same REi and confidence interval.",

To investigate whether this could indicate heightened infectiousness of index cases or just the natural decline of the susceptible population, we also calculated R0i by dividing REi by the proportion of the population susceptible on day i (pi) [21]. To calculate the proportion susceptible, we made the extreme assumptions that all cases were susceptible at the start of the outbreak and that the final cumulative attack rate was 100%, such that pi=1\u2212\u22111iCiC1 where C1 is the total number susceptible on day 1, or the total number of cases in the outbreak minus the number of index cases, and \u22111iCi is cumulative incidence to day i (excluding index cases). Using this approach, we compared estimates of R0i of index cases on day 1 to R0i estimated from cases with onset on days 2 to 4 of the outbreak (excluding days with no reported cases).",

However, a sensitivity analysis was performed using cases with available information on age and/or sex to examine whether these could be potential confounding variables. Information on resident vs. staff, diarrhea (yes or no), and vomiting (yes or no) were rarely missing (1%, 1%, and 0%, respectively) and were considered explanatory variables in our model. To account for clustering induced by correlation of REi\u2019s within the six outbreaks, outbreak number was included in the model as a random intercept. The full model, with log REi as the outcome, included the following explanatory variables: diarrhea, vomiting, resident. Furthermore, because each REi estimate had its own uncertainty, we used a meta-analysis approach and incorporated REi uncertainties by using inverse variance weighting. Weights were equal to the inverse of the sum of the three variance components: 1. variance from estimation of REi (unique to each onset date), 2. within-outbreak variance (unique to each outbreak), and 3. between-outbreak variance (equal for all estimates). The model was assessed for collinearity and no issues were found. We considered including \u2018time\u2019 in the model and adjusting for it as a potential confounder, as REi inevitably declines over time. However, we determined that time cannot be a confounder, since it cannot affect diarrhea, vomiting, or resident vs. staff, our explanatory variables of interest. We also considered including an interaction between diarrhea and vomit in the model, however we excluded this interaction term from the final model due to issues with collinearity with the individual vomit and diarrhea variables. The final model is shown below:\nlogREij=\u03b20+b0i+\u03b21Diarrheaij+\u03b22Vomitingij+\u03b23Residentij+eij\nwhere log REij represents the estimated log RE of the jth case from the ith outbreak, b0i represents the random slope for the ith outbreak, and eij represents residual heterogeneity of the jth case from the ith outbreak not explained by the model. The residual heterogeneity, eij, and random slope, b0j, are assumed to be independent and identically distributed (iid) with mean zero and their respective variances. Cases from the same outbreak were assigned the same random effect, whereas cases from different outbreaks were assumed to be independent. Final coefficient estimates and 95% confidence intervals were exponentiated to show the relationships between average REi (rather than log REi) and the variables in the model. All statistical analyses were performed using the EpiEstim [22] and metafor [23] packages in R software version 3.4.2.",

Findings were generally robust to assumptions about the serial interval and inclusion/exclusion criteria for cases with missing data.

Human challenge studies have found that vomiting, compared to diarrhea, is more likely to result in environmental contamination potentially leading to transmission through fomites and airborne droplets [26]. In household norovirus outbreaks, however, primary cases with diarrhea, but not vomiting, have been associated with higher secondary attack rates [27].

Outbreak reports have shown that nursing home outbreaks often start with single index cases [14], however the relative infectiousness of index cases (compared to non-index cases) has not been examined in these settings. We found that outbreaks tend to start with one or more cases who infect substantially more individuals compared to later cases. There are multiple possible explanations for this greater infectiousness of index cases. First, as an outbreak progresses and more individuals become ill and later immune, there is a natural decrease in the reproduction number. However, we found that index cases generally had substantially greater REi\u2019s compared to cases with onset dates only a few days after outbreak initiation, before a sufficient number of susceptibles could accumulate to explain this pattern. We also found that R0,1 (the basic reproduction number for index cases) tended to be substantially larger than R0,2\u20134 (the basic reproduction numbers for cases on days 2\u20134), even under the extreme assumptions that all individuals were initially susceptible and that the total population consisted only of reported cases in the outbreak. If the observed declines in REi had been due to a natural decrease in susceptibles alone, we would expect the calculated R0i values to remain relatively constant over time. Because this was the most extreme assumption, the differences between R0,1 and R0,2\u20134 estimates became even more pronounced when the population was assumed to have some level of immunity (e.g., 50% susceptibility). Therefore, these results suggest that index cases are more infectious than subsequent cases for reasons other than the natural decreases in susceptibles alone. Second, index cases may have been more infectious than non-index cases due to intrinsic case characteristics (e.g., vomiting). Under this hypothesis, the median REi may be ~1.0, meaning that most cases in the outbreak are only moderately infectious, but a highly infectious case is required to initiate an outbreak. This hypothesis is supported by a recent paper that found that vomiting in norovirus index cases was associated with an increased risk of nosocomial outbreaks [28]. Third, rapid implementation of effective outbreak control measures could curtail transmission. Lacking data on the timing and type of control measures, we could not explicitly account for this in our calculations. Results may be due to any one of these explanations, or some combination thereof.",

While staff clearly can transmit norovirus [12,14], studies of nosocomial outbreaks in the Netherlands have shown that symptomatic patients have the largest contribution to virus transmission in those settings [29]. The role of residents (vs. staff) in norovirus transmission in U.S. nursing homes may depend on the average level of mobility and dependency of residents. If nursing home residents are generally mobile, self-sufficient, and able to gather in communal rooms, they may be more likely than staff to contribute to norovirus transmission. Conversely, more self-sufficient residents may be more likely to identify symptoms of norovirus and self-quarantine, thus transmitting less.

First, all analyzed outbreaks took place in South Carolina, so results may not be generalizable to norovirus outbreaks in nursing homes in other U.S. states or elsewhere. Nursing home staffing levels vary widely across states [30], as do infection control training resources and healthcare-associated infection reporting [31]. Additionally, because all outbreaks were caused by genogroup II, and the two outbreaks genotyped were caused by GII.4 Sydney, results may not be generalizable to non-genogroup II or non-GII.4 outbreaks.",

Relatedly, index cases may have been misclassified if true index cases were missed. For norovirus, it\u2019s also possible that asymptomatic cases could contribute to transmission. However, studies have found that asymptomatic individuals in nosocomial outbreaks contribute significantly less to transmission than symptomatic individuals, leading us to believe that bias from missing asymptomatic cases is likely minimal [29]. Additionally, some reported cases could be sporadic or caused by a different etiologic agent. Furthermore, only the date of symptom onset, not time, was considered when calculating REi\u2019s. Because norovirus has a relatively short incubation period, it is possible, although unlikely, for primary and secondary cases to have the same symptom onset date. The method we used to calculate REi assumes that such cases cannot infect each other. Third, we excluded 9 cases with REi = 0 from the regression analyses, however including them in the main regression analysis only strengthened the associations between all three predictor variables and infectiousness. The association between vomiting and increased infectiousness remained the strongest. Lastly, we used a serial interval distribution estimated from household transmission associated with norovirus outbreaks in child daycare centers in Sweden and assumed a similar serial interval in our U.S. nursing homes. Unlike transmission in the households, where it was clear that the child daycare center attendee/staff infected others in the home, identifying transmission pairs in nursing home outbreaks is difficult, precluding direct estimation of serial intervals in these settings. The true serial interval may be longer or shorter in nursing homes. Regardless, we found that our main finding of the importance of vomiting in transmission was robust when using different values of the serial interval.",

            "text": "Because there is currently no publicly available norovirus vaccine, sound prevention and control measures are key to controlling norovirus outbreaks, but the present body of published literature does not provide an evidence-base for the value of specific measures [10]. These study results lend support for measures that focus on cases who vomit, particularly if those cases are residents (vs. staff). Results indicate that rapid response to a vomiting event may be effective in reducing the size and duration of norovirus outbreaks in nursing home settings, and support measures that reduce exposure to vomit, such as thorough cleaning and disinfection with a chlorine-based disinfectant, isolation of the case, and implementing antiemetic treatment after the first vomiting episode [26]. While cleaning with a chlorine-based disinfectant and isolation of cases are currently recommended control strategies, there are generally little data about the implementation and timing of these control measures in norovirus outbreaks [10]. Furthermore, the use of antiemetic drugs for the prevention and control of norovirus outbreaks is not widely recommended [32,33]. The important role of vomiting in transmission shown in our results suggests that the use of antiemetic drugs in nursing home outbreaks should be further considered. Information on type and timing of control measures was not available for this study. Future studies should collect such data and evaluate the effects of specific control measures using similar analytical methods to the approach used here. Future studies should also further examine the association between case infectiousness and the interaction between vomiting and diarrhea.",
