The World Health Organization has declared the diffusion of COVID-19 to be a pandemics and issued a strong warning of a severe global threat [2] . In the case of the COVID-19 epidemics there is also an infodemic of true and false news about the danger, the diffusion and the treatments of COVID-19 [3] . This context muddles the attempts to understand the epidemics and confuses the people. At the same time we assist to lively debates among scientists following the epidemics on all social media and platforms. Some of important questions are: (i) how many infected people are undetected? (ii) how the number of tests and testing policies affects the dynamics of epidemics? (iii) Is there a benefit in early testing? Some of those questions are addressed with different methods in the context of different epidemics or are recently addressed without explicit modeling effort. In [4] , authors statistically evaluate different strategies of testing in the context of ebola epidemics and show the importance of early testing. They found that availability of early testing would reduce epidemics by one third. In [5] authors review laboratory testing for influenza, which is often mentioned as similar to SARS-CoV-2in methods of spreading, and lay out all the possible ways in which early tests can be used in fighting the diffusion of such a disease. In [6] authors conclude that undocumented infections present main channel of geographic spread of SARS-CoV-2.",

In the model we propose four states of population -S (susceptible), U (undetected), D (detected) and R (removed), and one additional variable K which models the number of available test kits. Susceptible are those in population which can acquire disease. Infected individuals can be detected or undetected, therefore I = U + D. Detected are those that are positively tested, and undetected are infected of which no one knows of although some may be suspected for infection. Removed are those individuals that either healed and acquired immunity or are deceased. Total number of people in population is N .

The second term models the change of undetected to detected by random testing. If there are no tests no one can get detected, if there are no undetected again no one can get detected. It is then proportional to both the numbers of undetected and of kits. It is motivated by the idea that infected individuals report to hospital on the basis of symptoms (proportional to u) and get tested with higher probability if there is abundance of kits or lower if there is a scarcity of kits. The third term represents just the fraction of individuals that gets removed without ever been detected. Equation (3) has terms of opposite sign with respect to the second and the third previous equation and and additional removal term of detected individuals. Although The removal of a undetected individual happens only through healing (direct death without a transition to d can be neglected), while the removal of a detected individual can be due to both healing and death, it is reasonable that both detected and undetected individuals are removed with equal probability (4), to reduce the number of parameters. Equation (1) represents growth of fraction of kits. The first term in the equation represents a constant growth of the number of kits (fixed produced kits per time unit). The second term means that kits are used proportionally to the number of undetected individuals and the number of available kits, which makes sense and also prevents the number of kits to become negative. The parameter measures how many more tests have to be done to switch an undetected individual to detected, this term always has to be equal or larger than the corresponding term \u03b4uk in equations (2) and (3).",

The reason for this is very similar to their model in the sense that there is a reduction of the epidemic spreading for those individual that enter into this new compartment. This is also checked from the analytical point of view and an expression very similar to the one found in [13] is obtained. However one can see that the fraction of infected individuals in such power-law regime, multiplied by the Italian population predicts less than one single individual, and therefore this very initial theoretical regime is unobserved in real data for Italy. On the contrary, in Figure 3 one can see that for a range of parameters values a successive exponential growth is obtained as expected in any epidemics dynamics. In this respect it is noteworthy that the exponential rate in the model is always smaller than the one observed in real cases. Parameters which are modeled for SIR have \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3 as exponent on the onset of epidemics, while ours is given by \u03b2 \u2212 \u03c6 \u2212 \u03b3. Using the parameters measured for SIR changes the slope (depending on the strength of testing term). One of the most interesting aspects of our new model is the appearance of two different peaks in the dynamical evolution of the densities of the two sub-classes of infected people, undetected and detected. The peak related to undetected individuals is in general occurring before the peak of detected ones. The earlier the peak of detected happens the smaller is the number of total infected at the end of epidemics. We have found a very interesting relationship between the time t D,max at which the peak of detected occurs and the parameter \u03b1 giving the production rate of the testing kits:",

Note that this does not mean that there are no newly infected, but simply that the number of new undetected per day is kept below a certain value. When the two rates equate, we have a clear separation between the region with small and manageable population of u and full blow up of the epidemics. The repercussion of this result is that testing can have an immense impact if it is done in time and in a smart calibrated on the rate of transmission of the infection in the population. Indeed it is important to stress that the way Singapore handled the Covid-19 crisis [14] is very similar to our model. Moreover Japan and Hong Kong are also managing well the diffusion of the epidemics during the writing of this paper: indeed \u03b1 = 0.0002, as reported for the Hong Kong case [15] , is within the meaningful range of parameters we used in this model. This leads us to believe that developed countries which are adopting testing policies postponing a widespread testing activity until they have full blown epidemics are probably wrong. This result would also suggest that sharing of tests among nations is fundamen-tal in order to mitigate the epidemics diffusion.",
