This is coupled with one of the lowest availability of health care workforce in the world, with only 7.4 skilled workers per 10 000 population [6]. Aligning the situation with the dimension of access by Penchasky and Thomas [7], limited availability coupled with reduced accessibility in the peri-urban and rural health care settings may contribute to a health care catastrophe in addressing the control of COVID-19.",

Despite the surge, the testing rate is too low to uncover the true burden of COVID-19 in Bangladesh, considering the population size (13 tests per million) [8]. On the other hand, the surge on daily testing has only managed to expose some hotspots which were already known to be the densely populated areas of the capital. Therefore, the recent opening of the manufacturing industries, with subsequent closure due to criticism, contributed to migration to the overcrowded areas of the city [9]. Such initiatives can lead to a dual burden of risk transmission, to both the rural community and the urban community. This happens at a greater pace, owing to the mass migration of the factory workers.",

These can impact not only the health system planning and response in terms of financial input, but also appropriate service delivery and required supply to address the COVID-19 due to the changing dynamics of population density in the event of reduced sanctions. Additionally, it can lead to a surge on heightened risk of exposure due to minimized health response priorities, efforts and initiatives - such as contact tracing and testing in the rural areas and considering their movement to the urban areas.",
