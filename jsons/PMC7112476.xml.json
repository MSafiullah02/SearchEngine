As soon as an infectious disease\nbegins to spread in the population, an effective immunization program should be initiated\nwhich may be adjusted according to the disease prevalence and the program terminates when\nthe disease dies out. Therefore, the epidemic information-based immunization allows us to\ntake the advantage of the interplay between the immunization response and the epidemic\nspreading. Motivated by this idea, researchers have evaluated the efficacy of various\ndynamic immunization schemes by using network models with direct immunization13\u201315 or other modelling approaches.\nFor example, Shaban et al.16 formulated real-time susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR)\nvaccination models for contact tracing in a network with a specific degree distribution by a\nbranching process approximation. Nian and Wang17 proposed a strategy to immunize the neighbors of an infected node.\nRuan et al.10 studied an\ninformation-driven vaccination program and found that strengthening the information\ndiffusion can reduce the final vaccination fraction. Wang et al.18 investigated the interplay between\ninformation spreading and disease dynamics in an information-driven vaccination program. Jo\nand Baek19 and Fu et\nal.20 evaluated efficiencies of\nimmunization schemes in the susceptible-infected-recovered-susceptible (SIRS) and\nsusceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) networks, respectively. Zhang et\nal.21 investigated the impact\nof subsidy policies on vaccination decisions under the voluntary vaccination. More recently,\nTakaguchi et al.22\nproposed an immunization strategy based on observer placement, which is shown to be very\nefficient for disease control in the clustering networks.",

However, in reality, the vaccine supply\nis limited compared with the large population size at risk, especially for those diseases\ntriggered by novel pathogens. Furthermore, vaccines may deliver to only a partial population\ndue to other economic or humanity constraints. Therefore, it becomes much more realistic to\nconsider a local immunization program that only covers a specified subpopulation (denoted by\n\u03a9 in what follows).23 It becomes of\ninterest to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of static as well as dynamic immunization\nschemes for this realistic situation. A recent paper23 investigated the SIS epidemic model with local immunization\nprogram and showed that the condition of epidemic outbreak is not related to the\nimmunization strength. The SIS modelling framework is well-accepted for describing\ninfections, such as rotavirus and gonorrhea, which do not confer long-lasting immunity.\nHowever, a SIR framework is more suitable for infections such as measles, mumps, and\nchickenpox where individuals recover and confer lifelong immunity, which is the fundamental\nframework we will extend in the current paper with network structures. Furthermore, we are\nalso interested in the comparison of predictions obtained from the immunization programs for\nthese two network model frameworks.",

These high-risk\nnodes can be found through contact tracing theoretically.16,24,25 However, in practice, it is not easy to\nlocate all these high-risk nodes and there exists a discount rate. Hence, we introduce an\nadjustable parameter \u03b4, denoted as the tracing rate or immunization rate,\nto account the efficiency of tracing and immunizing these high-risk nodes.

Generally speaking, Q is an increasing function\nof \u03b4 (Figs. 4(b)\u20134(d)). However, in\nFig. 4(a), when the infection rate \u03b2\nis relatively small, say \u03b2 = 0.2, the immunization efficiency is\nnegatively correlated to the immunization strength, as highlighted by three blue lines. It\nis due to the dual effect of the increased immunization strength.23 Although increasing \u03b4 enlarges\nvaccination coverage, it also halts the spreading of an epidemic with a small infection\nrate across hub nodes and hence decreases propensity for vaccination. The relationship\nbetween \u03c4c and \u03b4 is illustrated by dashed\nlines in each panel of Fig. 4. Almost all of these\ncurves lie in the red region, showing that the immunization efficiency should be very high\nto control the disease. It is noticed that at the case \u03b4 = 1, the\nexpression of \u03c4c is reduced to be the same as the\ncorresponding static immunization in Ref. 38.\nHowever, the spreading patterns between dynamic and static immunization are not the same,\nas many susceptible nodes are not vaccinated in \u03a9 for the dynamic immunization.",

As we know,\nthe SIR-like epidemic network model can be analyzed by various approaches, such as the\npercolation theory,43 the branching\nprocess approximation,16 and the effective\ndegree approaches.32,44 Recently, the\nheterogeneous mean-field approach poses a good tool to analyze complex disease dynamics due\nto its simple and deterministic formulation.18,28 In this manuscript, we formulated real-time immunization models\nwith the discrete-time HMF approach, where susceptible nodes can get immunized by contact\ntracing from infected nodes. Considering the real situations of vaccine shortages such that\nthe number of vaccines cannot cover the whole population, we propose a local immunization\nprogram that can only immunize a given node set \u03a9 in the whole population, which can be\ndefined as a geological region of a city or a social group of a population or other groups\nsharing some characteristics. The epidemic thresholds for different (local versus global)\nvaccination scenarios against infectious diseases are obtained from stability analysis,\nbased on which the effectiveness of a vaccination program can be evaluated. The predicted\nthresholds are validated through numerical simulations. Our result suggests that the local\nimmunization program can greatly improve the efficiency of static immunization, requiring a\nsmaller amount of vaccines to effectively control disease spread. However, the efficacy of\nvaccination programs not only depends on immunization rate but also on the choice of\nindividual group to immunize. Therefore, it remains pivotal to extend the approach in this\nmanuscript to other local immunization strategies, with different targeted vaccination\ngroups to get an optimal strategy for disease control. This may contribute toward the\noptimal strategy of vaccine allocation for emerging infectious diseases such as influenza A\n(H1N1).45",
