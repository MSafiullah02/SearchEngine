Due to the tightness of protective equipment, sweat evaporation is blocked, resulting in wet humid skin. After the skin is stimulated by moisture, the skin surface is weakly acidic and damaged, weakening the barrier functions. .3 It is easily susceptible to external forces such as friction and pressure damage.3 Device-related pressure injuries mostly occur in areas with less adipose tissue such as forehead, bridge of the nose and cheek.4\n",
