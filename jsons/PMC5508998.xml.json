            "text": "\nGlutamyl endopeptidases (GEPases) are enzymes that preferentially cleave the\nbonds of the \u03b1-carboxyl groups of glutamic acid\n[1, 2].\nGEPases from a number of gram-positive bacteria\n[23-25]\nand (+)RNA viruses have been characterized to date. All GEPases belong to the structural\nchymotrypsin family, which is one of the most extensive and well-studied\nfamilies. Chymotrypsin-like protease (CLP) molecules share their spatial\norganization principle; the so-called chymotrypsin (or trypsin) fold\n(Fig. 1).\nThe residue at the P1 position is a key determinant\nof the hydrolysis sites of CLPs (according to the Schechter and Berger\nnomenclature, the cleaved bond of the substrate is located downstream of the P1\nresidue, which corresponds to the S1-binding site of an enzyme\n[26]). Similar to pancreatic serine proteases,\nCLPs are conventionally classified into three main groups: 1) hydrolyzing bonds\nformed by the \u03b1-carboxyl groups of large hydrophobic amino acid residues\n(chymotrypsin-like specificity), 2) cleaving bonds downstream of positively\ncharged residues (trypsin-like specificity), and 3) preferring small\nhydrophobic residues at the P1 position (elastase-like specificity)\n[27]. Furthermore, CLPs with mixed specificity\nhave been discovered. For example, collagenolytic enzymes isolated from crabs\nexhibit the combined specificity of trypsin, chymotrypsin, and elastase\n[28], while bovine duodenase\n[29] and cathepsin G\n[30] can efficiently hydrolyze the substrates\nof both trypsin and chymotrypsin. In addition, CLPs cleaving bonds preferentially\ndownstream of the Gln residue (e.g., many 3C-like viral proteases\n[23]) and being specific to negatively\ncharged amino acid residues (e.g., granzyme B that preferentially hydrolyzes\nbonds downstream of Asp residues [31]\nand the GEPases that this review focuses on) are known.\n",

The structure of this enzyme is\ngenerally typical for CLPs\n(Fig. 2A) and is the most\nsimilar to that of bacterial CLPs (proteases A and B from Str. griseus\nand \u03b1-lytic protease). The overall geometry of the S1 site is\nalso very close to the geometry of this region in the aforelisted bacterial\nenzymes. Contrary to expectations, no explicit compensator for the negative\ncharge of the substrate, Lys or Arg residue, was detected in the S1 site. The\ncarboxyl group of Glu at position P1 of the substrate forms hydrogen bonds with\nSer190 (192 if numbering [44] is used),\nSer126, and His213. Hence, these residues probably play the key role in\nsubstrate recognition. The side chain of histidine can be positively charged.\nHowever, if pKa of the side chain of His213 in the absence of the substrate is\ntaken to be 6.4, the imidazole ring will be protonated by less than 1% at the\npH 8.5 that is optimum for the functioning of Glu\u2013SGP; therefore,\nhistidine is expected to be neutrally charged [44]. Meanwhile, pKa of amino acid residues in the proteins can\nvary significantly depending on the environment [45]. An analysis of the Glu-SGP structure has revealed that it\ncarries the so-called histidine triad containing His199 and His228, along with\nHis213. The three His residues permeate the C-terminal \u03b2-cylindrical\ndomain to form a chain of hydrogen bonds that links the carboxyl group of the\nsubstrate Glu\u2013P1 and, via two water molecules bound to the enzyme, the\nN-terminal rim of the C-terminal \u03b1-helix of the molecule\n(Fig. 2B).\nIt was postulated that this very structure ensures the transfer\nof the positive charge compensating for the substrate charge from the\nmicrodipole of the \u03b1-helix to His213 of the substrate-binding site [44]. Let us mention that the histidine triad\nresidues in GEPases are not conserved [46] and, in addition to Glu\u2013SGP, have been found only in\nthe highly homologous enzyme from Str. fradiae [13].\n",

Second, most 3C/3CLpros retain the Thr/Ser190 residue that is\ntypical of GEPases [58], thus confirming\nthe conclusion that it is crucial for the formation of an adequate geometry of\nthe S1 pocket rather than for charge recognition.

This implies that activity is strictly controlled via a\nrather complex and somewhat controversial mechanism. At first glance, the\nGlu\u2013V8, BIGEP, and Esp precursors are supposed to be inactive, since the\nS1 site in these proteins is formed only in the mature molecule\n(Fig. 7\nand Fig. 8). Meanwhile, data have been published\ndemonstrating that the precursors of Glu-V8\n[113], BIGEP [109],\nEsp [7], as well as GEPases from\nB. licheniformis [114], B. subtilis [102], and Thermoactinomyces sp. [21] are capable of autoprocessing; in most\ncases, it is the bonds corresponding to the specificity of the mature enzymes\nthat are cleaved [7, 21, 109, 114].\nFurthermore, glutamate activity in trans of precursor\nanalogues has been detected [100].\nThese facts cast doubt on the mere possibility of regulating the activity of\nthe proteases under discussion, although a closer look at the precursor\nactivation mechanism demonstrates that the situation is more complex.\n",

These species exhibit\nno activity with respect to protein substrates and low activity with respect to\npeptides in trans and can be activated only\nheterocatalytically [7, 100, 109, 113, 114]. To make the picture complete, we would\nlike to add that data on the enzyme from Thermoactinomyces sp.\ncarrying Glu1, which can be autoactivated in vitro in a\nheterologous expression system [21],\nidentically to the previously artificially obtained mutants of other GEPases\n[109, 114], have been published recently. Hence, maturation of\nenzymes similar to Glu\u2013V8 is a stepwise process. These proteins seem to\ncontain two propeptides. The first one is a long folding assistant [99, 109] that ensures the kinetic stability of a mature protein\nas often occurs in bacterial proteases [115]. The second propeptide, which is short and forms after\nthe first processing step, is the activation unit [109, 113, 114] that maintains the inactive state of the\nenzyme. Furthermore, it cannot be ruled out that the structure of the active\nsite of proteases changes after the first propeptide portion is removed. It is\nfair to say that propeptides of the discussed group of GEPases simultaneously\ncombine properties typical of the propeptides of bacterial CLPs and mammalian\nenzymes. Hence, the need for strict regulation of the activity of Glu-V8-like\nenzymes is satisfied through the formation of the S1 pocket only after the\npropeptide has been deleted. A mechanism similar to the activation mechanism of\nmammalian CLPs is used: involvement of the N-terminal amino group in the\nstructure of the molecule elements essential for catalysis. However, the\nfolding assistant is deleted autocatalytically due to the basic specificity of\nthe enzymes.\n",

Hence, neither the formation of a functionally active enzyme before\nprocessing nor strict activity regulation is required. The variant observed in\nGEPases from viruses and Streptomyces would be suitable here.\nHowever, a phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that ETs are most likely to be\nGlu\u2013V8 paralogues\n(Fig. 9, see\ndiscussion below); i.e., these proteins are \u201cengineered\u201d on the\nsame basis as Glu\u2013V8 and employ essentially the same architecture of the S1 site\n(Fig. 8).\nMeanwhile, unlike Glu\u2013V8, ETs contain no propeptides, being\nindicative of a different folding mechanism [115], and exhibit a much narrower specificity. They are\ninactive with respect to most proteins and peptides, which is possibly attained\nthrough inserting the Lys216 residue and reducing the volume of the S1 pocket,\nas well as due to the unusual conformation of the oxyanion hole [83].\n",

The only attempt at a phylogenetic analysis of enzymes\nbelonging to this group was found in a study published 20 years ago [46]. Therefore, in this review we compared the\nsequences of the characterized GEPases and some CLPs with different\nspecificities in order to build a phylogenetic tree\n(Fig. 9).\nFirst, we would like to mention, as the authors of\n[46] did, that there is an impression that\nGEPases have appeared in the phylogenetic tree of GLPs at least twice. This is\nindicated by the presence of two remote branches of bacterial GEPases: one branch\ncontains proteins similar to Glu-V8 and ET, while the second one corresponds to\nenzymes from Streptomyces. (The phylogenetic position of viral\nproteases is difficult to infer, since the topology of the resulting tree in\nthe portion concerning these proteins is unreliable.) It is especially\nillustrative that GEPases from Streptomyces are just a small\nsprout in the branch of bacterial proteases exhibiting broad specificity. This\nobservation gives grounds for assuming that there is quite a high probability\nthat glutamate specificity (actually, any other specificity) develops via the\nchymotrypsin fold. Modification of the key residues of the S1 pocket (His213,\nThr/Ser190) that provide the required geometry and minimal interactions for the\nbinding of Glu/ Gln residues is apparently needed for that. However, this basic\nspecificity probably needs to be enhanced, which can be achieved through\ndifferent mechanisms, in particular by inserting a compensator into the S1\nsite. However, this is not the only possibility as demonstrated by the analysis\nof enzymes from viruses and Streptomyces. Special attention\nshould be focused on the branch combining all bacterial GEPases, except for\nenzymes isolated from Streptomyces. As expected, the topology\nof this branch corresponds to the taxonomy of producer bacteria. ETs and\nstaphylococcal enzymes, such as Glu-V8, share the phylogenetic tree\u2019s\nbranch; i.e., they are structurally closer to each other than they are to the\nremaining bacterial GEPases.\n",
