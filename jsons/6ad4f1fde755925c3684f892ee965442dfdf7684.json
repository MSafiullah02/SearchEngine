Of all high frequency ventilation techniques, high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) is the most well studied and is the most commonly utilized in clinical practice today. In HFOV, small volume oscillatory vibrations are superimposed on continuous distending pressure in a manner that allows effi cient CO 2 elimination during continuous alveolar recruitment. By preserving end-expiratory lung volume, minimizing cyclic stretch, and avoiding alveolar overdistension at end-inspiration, HFOV is uniquely capable of providing the ultimate \"open lung\" strategy of ventilation. Over the past decade, a growing evidence base implicating phasic alveolar stretch in the pathogenesis of acute and chronic lung injury in patients with respiratory failure has driven the iterative refi nement of HFOV management protocols for infants, children, and adults. The next step toward applying HFOV in a manner that takes into account the heterogeneity of parenchymal involvement in diseases such as the acute respiratory distress syndrome will require the development of non-invasive bedside technologies capable of identifying regional changes in lung volume and lung mechanics. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a promising technique that could play a supporting role in the conduct of future clinical trials seeking to identify HFOV strategies that are maximally lung protective.",

While it had been appreciated years earlier that pressure oscillations could enhance oxygen diffusion [ 1 ] , the stage was fully set for the dawning of the HFOV era in the early 1970s, after several investigators independently reported that applying small volume oscillatory vibrations to the airway effi ciently eliminated CO 2 , even in the absence of chest wall excursion [ 2 -5 ] . The discovery was made incidentally, during experiments designed to measure cardiac or lung impedance in large animals and humans. The investigators' fortuitous decision to monitor CO 2 clearance provided the proof that ventilation with sub-dead space tidal volumes was possible. Thereafter, HFOV was recognized as a highly promising supportive care strategy, and very quickly it went on to play a major role in the global paradigm shift toward \"open lung\" ventilation techniques. By 1980, a series of 12 patients ranging in age from 3 days to 74 years had been successfully supported for an hour at a time, using a prototype piston pump oscillator capable of delivering tidal volumes as low as 7.5 mL, at 15 Hz [ 6 ] . In early 1983, the fi rst pilot trial of HFOV for neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) began enrolling infants [ 7 ] .",

Concurrently, evidence implicating phasic alveolar stretch in the pathogenesis of acute and chronic lung injury in patients with respiratory failure has driven the iterative refi nement of HFOV protocols. As of now, a large body of evidence suggests that repetitive cycles of pulmonary recruitment and de-recruitment are associated with identifiable markers of lung injury, and experimental models of ventilatory support which avoid alveolar overdistention, reverse atelectasis, and limit phasic changes in lung volume appear to be less injurious [ 8 -15 ] . Chief among the major clinical trials that support this concept is the ARDS Network (ARDSNet) trial published in 2000. The ARDSNet investigators demonstrated that adults with acute lung injury or the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) who were randomized to receive a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg (predicted body weight) with plateau pressure limitation to \u226430 cm H 2 O had a mortality reduction of 22 % relative to those ventilated with 12 mL/kg tidal volumes and allowable plateau pressures up to 50 cm H 2 O [ 16 ] . This study is also one of several that would demonstrate a greater reduction in plasma levels of proinfl ammatory cytokines among patients who are ventilated with lower tidal volumes [ 10 , 17 , 18 ] . Together these studies suggest that reducing the magnitude of phasic stretch during mechanical ventilation attenuates the systemic infl ammatory response and can potentially reduce the incidence of nonpulmonary organ dysfunction in patients with respiratory failure.",

HFOV remains the most widely used form of high frequency ventilation in clinical practice today. In HFOV, lung recruitment and oxygenation are maintained by the application of relatively high mean airway pressure (Paw), while ventilation is achieved by superimposed sinusoidal pressure oscillations (\u2206P) that are delivered by an electromagnetically driven piston-diaphragm at a frequency of 3-15 Hz [ 11 , 19 ] . HFOV is the only form of high frequency ventilation in which expiration is an \"active\" process. This means that CO 2 egress is facilitated by pressure gradients produced with each retrograde movement of the ventilator's piston, rather than requiring lung recoil or involvement of skeletal musculature. As a result, alveolar ventilation can be achieved during HFOV using tidal volumes in the range of 1-3 mL/kg, even in the most poorly compliant lungs [ 19 ] .",

While direct bulk fl ow can be enough to ventilate proximal alveolar units during HFOV, the key advantage of high frequency techniques in facilitating gas transport throughout the lung has to do with its ability to markedly accelerate the movement of gas molecules [ 20 ] . The added velocity alters the dynamics of gas distribution in ways that facilitate gas exchange. First, during HFOV effi cient gas mixing is believed to occur through radial diffusion taking place along the parabolic inspiratory gas front as it advances down the airways [ 20 -22 ] . Second, shear fl ows created by the advancing gas front spread concentration gradients over a broad axial area, a phenomenon called \"Taylor dispersion\", which further facilitates diffusion. Third, \" Pendelluft \", or mixing of gases among alveolar units with varying time constants, also contributes signifi cantly to gas exchange at high frequencies [ 20 -23 ] . Finally, axial asymmetry of inspiratory and expiratory gas fl ow profi les creates separation of fresh gas and exhaled gas so that inspiratory gas fl ow travels down the central axis of the airway, while expiratory fl ow is distributed along the airway wall [ 20 -22 ] .",

Experiments performed in healthy rabbits have shown that CO 2 elimination during HFOV is a function of frequency and the square of the tidal volume ( V CO 2 = f \u00d7 Vt 2 ) [ 24 ] . In HFOV, tidal volume varies directly with the amplitude of oscillation (\u0394P), and varies inversely with the frequency (Hz) [ 25 ] . Reducing the frequency effectively lengthens the overall cycle time, which enhances CO 2 elimination at the expense of a longer inspiratory time and a higher stroke (tidal) volume. Although much of the foundational research on HFOV involved the use of higher frequency ranges, satisfactory CO 2 elimination can probably occur at many potential combinations of f and Vt, with higher frequency ranges providing conditions of lowest lung impedance and consequently, a lower pressure cost of ventilation [ 26 , 27 ] .",

While this relationship also holds true for conventional ventilation, an important distinction between the two modalities is that HFOV delivers the Paw as a continuous distending pressure, which maximizes the alveolar surface area available for gas exchange throughout the respiratory cycle. In the injured lung, HFOV produces better oxygenation and higher mean lung volume than conventional ventilation at an equivalent Paw, provided that the Paw is set above the lung ' s opening pressure ( Fig. 10 .1 ) [ 29 ] . If HFOV is initiated early enough in the disease process that pressurevolume hysteresis is preserved, a preceding recruitment maneuver can position the lung on the defl ation limb of the volume-pressure curve, where lung volume (and oxygenation) is maintained at a lower Paw. Carefully adjusting the Paw setting downward, letting it hover just above the lung's closing pressure, will exploit pulmonary hysteresis, allowing satisfactory oxygenation at the lowest possible pressure cost ( Fig. 10 .2 ). In practice, this corresponds to the lowest Paw value that maintains the oxygenation gains from the recruitment maneuver. HFOV's superior ability to capitalize on pressure-volume hysteresis is a key part of the rationale for its use in the management of diffuse alveolar disease and airleak syndromes.",

Most of the clinical experience with HFOV involves the SensorMedics 3100A (CareFusion Corporation, Yorba Linda CA), which was approved for use in neonates in 1991 and for older infants and children in 1995. More recently, the SensorMedics 3100B highfrequency oscillatory ventilator (CareFusion, Yorba Linda, CA) became available for use in larger pediatric patients (>35 kg) and adult patients. The 3100B model was approved for use outside of the US in 1998 and within the US in 2001, addressing concerns arising from large animal experiments that adequate alveolar ventilation for larger patients might not be achievable using the 3100A model [ 32 , 33 ] . The 3100B differs from the 3100A model by having a more powerful electromagnet, which produces faster acceleration to maximal oscillatory pressure (\u0394P). It also allows a higher maximal bias fl ow, which makes it possible to deliver higher mean airway pressures [ 34 ] . Many pediatric intensive care units now use the 3100A and 3100B oscillators interchangeably for older children, although operating each machine using a particular combination of settings may not produce exactly the same results in an individual patient. The automated piston centering mechanism on the current generation of 3100B oscillators was designed to counteract retrograde piston displacement when maintenance Paw is set in the range of 40-45 cm H 2 O [ 31 ] . At least one group of investigators has observed that operating the 3100B using an I:E of 1:2 and a lower Paw (30 cm H 2 O) can cause the piston position to shift in a way that truncates the pressure waveform, reducing tidal volume delivery below what the 3100A model would deliver at the same settings [ 31 ] . Clinicians can compensate for this phenomenon by adjusting settings as appropriate to achieve therapeutic objectives.",

Preclinical data have consistently shown that limitation of expiratory time using an I:E ratio of 1:1 promotes alveolar gas trapping. In fact, under certain conditions mean alveolar pressure can actually exceed the Paw displayed on the ventilator console [ 28 , 30 , 40 -42 ] .

            "text": "Many neonatal intensive care units now use HFOV preferentially over conventional ventilation to support the most vulnerable preterm infants with moderate to severe lung disease [ 43 ] . In older infants and children, typical indications for initiating HFOV include (1) diffuse alveolar disease without evidence of severe airfl ow obstruction or intracranial [ 44 ] . When transitioning the patient from conventional (phasic) ventilation to HFOV, the Paw on HFOV is typically set up to 5 cm H 2 O above the Paw last used on the conventional ventilator, in order to maintain recruitment in the face of pressure attenuation by the endotracheal tube. Amplitude (\u0394P) is set by adjusting the Power control, which controls the amount of current that is delivered to the motor driving the ventilator piston. The frequency is initially set between 10 and 15 Hz for small infants. However, when initiating HFOV in children and adults, a lower frequency setting is usually necessary in order to achieve adequate ventilation. Strict age-based ranges have historically determined where clinicians set the frequency, partly out of concern that the present generation of high frequency ventilators would not be capable of generating enough volume displacement to adequately ventilate larger patients unless the frequency was drastically reduced. However, recent studies in test lung models [ 30 ] , large animal models [ 38 ] , and adult humans [ 30 ] have confi rmed that frequency reductions have a greater impact on tidal volume delivery than amplitude increases, and tidal volumes approaching those generated endotracheal tube. Alveolar pressures are measured using a pressure transducer attached to a low mass capsule mounted on the pleural surface. Panels depict signifi cant, progressive amplitude attenuation across the endotracheal tube, from airway opening (\" PRX \") to trachea (\" TRC \") and down to the alveolus (\" ALV \") (p < 0.0001) (Reprinted from Gerstmann et al. [ 35 ] . With permission from Nature Publishing Group) during conventional ventilation can be delivered when \"low frequency HFOV\" is used (Fig. 10.4 ) . Small animal models of lung injury appear to confi rm that low frequency ventilation (5 Hz) produces histologic evidence of more severe ventilator-associated injury than high frequency ventilation (15 Hz) , although studies differ on the magnitude of this difference [ 45 , 46 ] . In accordance with these data, contemporary HFOV management protocols suggest maintaining the frequency at the highest level that will provide adequate ventilation [ 30 , 43 , 44 , 47 , 48 ] (Fig. 10.5 ). For patients with lower airways disease or for small infants who achieve adequate recruitment on low mean airway pressures, some experts advocate modest reductions in maintenance frequency in order to counter the tendency for lower airways collapse and air trapping in these situations [ 42 ] .",

            "text": "If employing an \" open lung \" ventilation strategy for diffuse alveolar disease ( Fig. 10 .5 ), a static recruitment maneuver is performed, and Paw is adjusted relative to the initial setting (in 1-2 cm H 2 O increments) until the arterial saturation stabilizes at \u226590 %. The next step in confi rming that the patient has achieved a satisfactory degree of alveolar recruitment is to titrate the FiO 2 downward, with the goal of arriving at a Paw that will allow arterial saturations to stabilize at \u226588-90 % (PaO 2 55-80 Torr) using an FiO 2 of \u22640.6, without evidence of hyperinfl ation or decreased cardiac output. Patients with any degree of intravascular volume depletion will often require volume expansion during the recruitment phase of HFOV initiation because under these conditions, alveolar pressure can quickly exceed the perfusing pressure of the adjacent pulmonary vasculature, creating an increase in alveolar dead space and hemodynamic deterioration [ 49 , 50 ] . The fi nal step in verifying the adequacy of lung recruitment following HFOV initiation, and an important mechanism for monitoring it thereafter, is to ensure that both hemidiaphragms are displaced to the level of the 8th or 9th posterior rib on chest x-ray [ 19 ] . When the patient demonstrates an ability to maintain target saturations on FiO 2 of 0.5-0.6 for a period of time, he or she will generally begin to tolerate slow downward titrations of Paw in increments of 1-2 cm H 2 O, provided saturations remain stable. Once compliance begins to improve, surface forces will normalize, rendering the lung less prone to closure, and thus allowing lung volume to be maintained as Paw is decreased [ 51 ] . Until this occurs, suctioning should be minimized and unnecessary circuit disconnections should be avoided. A typical sequence of steps for addressing hypercarbia after verifying the patency of the endotracheal tube and an appropriate degree of lung infl ation includes (i) increasing the \u0394P in increments of 3 cm H 2 O until Power is maximized, (ii) subsequently decreasing the frequency in increments of 0.5-1 Hz, and (iii) partially defl ating the endotracheal tube cuff, if present, to allow additional egress of CO 2 ( Fig. 10 .5 ) [ 34 , 52 , 53 ] . In the latter case, any decrement in Paw should be corrected by further restricting the circuit pressure control valve (turning the \"mean pressure adjust\" knob clockwise) or by increasing the bias fl ow of fresh gas as necessary to maintain a stable level of distending pressure [ 34 , 53 ] . In the event that very high pressure amplitudes are required to provide adequate ventilation, typical maintenance bias fl ow settings may be inadequate to ensure CO 2 clearance from the circuit. In this setting, the bias fl ow should be augmented to counter potential increases in the circuit's effective dead space [ 30 , 39 ] .",

            "text": "High chest wall compliance, surfactant defi ciency, and unstable end expiratory lung volume all interact to potentiate repetitive cycles of derecruitment and reinfl ation that make the preterm neonatal lung particularly well-suited to an open lung strategy of ventilation. Over 20 years ago, a preclinical study exposing surfactant-defi cient premature baboons to either HFOV or conventional ventilation demonstrated that early use of HFOV appeared to protect the animals from developing mechanical, biochemical, and histologic evidence of hyaline membrane disease [ 57 ] . A follow up study published in 2000 exposed surfactant-defi cient premature baboons to exogenous surfactant plus either early HFOV or \"lung sparing\" conventional ventilation with tidal volumes reduced to 4-6 mL/kg [ 58 ] . HFOV was initiated using a Paw 2 cm H 2 O above what was required to stabilize the animal on the conventional ventilator. Target blood gas tensions in each group were identical (PaCO 2 45-55 Torr; PaO 2 55-80 Torr), and high supplemental oxygen fractions were avoided through preferential increases in mean airway pressure or PEEP. Remarkably, the animals received supportive care for 1-2 months, allowing the investigators to sequentially examine an array of mechanical, cellular, and biochemical parameters as they sought to determine whether HFOV could mitigate the development of chronic lung disease over time. Animals supported with HFOV demonstrated signifi cantly better pulmonary mechanics for nearly every one of the 8 time points at which they were evaluated between 12 h and 28 days (p < 0.05). Although betweengroups differences for tracheal cytokine concentrations were less consistent across the study period, conventionally ventilated animals demonstrated signifi cantly higher macrophage/ monocyte, eosinophil, and lymphocyte infi ltration by 10 days (p < 0.05). Finally, while both groups of animals demonstrated histopathologic fi ndings consistent with chronic lung disease on post mortem examination, HFOV supported animals showed signifi cantly better lung infl ation patterns by panel of standards analysis (p < 0.001). Together these studies are representative of a remarkable two decades of scientifi c inquiry, which established that ventilator-associated injury amplifi es the infl ammatory response to the primary parenchymal insult experienced by patients with respiratory failure. Thus, the magnitude of acute lung injury, and the incidence and extent of chronic lung injury, are modifi able through the use of more protective ventilation strategies. Despite HFOV's sound physiologic rationale and the large body of preliminary evidence affi rming its potential advantages [ 2 , 6 , 7 , 29 , 59 -61 ] , larger scale efforts to evaluate the effi cacy of HFOV versus conventional ventilation for human hyaline membrane disease (i.e., neonatal respiratory distress syndrome or RDS) had a disappointing start. The fi rst large randomized, controlled trial in premature infants comparing high-frequency ventilation using a piston oscillator with conventional mechanical ventilation was published during the pre-surfactant era by the HIFI Study Group [ 62 ] . This crossover trial was designed to evaluate the impact of HFOV on the incidence of chronic lung disease of prematurity and included 673 infants weighing 750-2,000 g who had been supported less than 12 h on conventional ventilation for respiratory failure in the fi rst 24 h of life. Infants randomized to receive HFOV were administered a Paw and FiO 2 equal to those administered on conventional ventilation. Infants assigned to the HFOV arm who had not already been tracheally intubated at the time of randomization were supported using an FiO 2 equal to what they received before intubation, and a Paw of 8-10 cm H 2 O. In each arm of the trial, hypoxemia was fi rst addressed by increasing the FiO 2 , and then by increasing the Paw [ 62 ] . Signifi cantly more infants in the HFOV group crossed over to the conventional arm of the trial after they were judged to have failed therapy with the assigned ventilator (26 % vs 17 %; p = 0.01). All infants were analyzed as part of the study group to which they were assigned. Ultimately the study was unable to show a significant difference in the incidence of chronic lung disease or in 28-day mortality between the two groups. Despite the fact that the HIFI investigators made efforts to limit maintenance mean airway pressures and indeed did not incorporate alveolar recruitment into the HFOV strategy, infants in the HFOV arm experienced a signifi cantly higher incidence of airleak (3 % vs 1 %; p = 0.05). They also experienced a signifi cantly higher incidence of periventricular leukomalacia and highgrade intraventricular hemorrhage, unanticipated developments that contributed to the trial's early closure [ 3 , 62 ] .",

            "text": "A decade later, two large multicenter trials were published in an effort to clarify the role of high-frequency ventilation in the management of the infant respiratory distress syndrome [ 63 , 64 ] . By this time, many centers had accumulated a great deal of experience using the 3100A high frequency oscillator in neonates. Each of these trials emphasized alveolar recruitment as part of the HFOV strategy. In their remarkably well-controlled study, Courtney and colleagues randomized 500 preterm infants to receive either conventional ventilation targeting a tidal volume of 5-6 mL per kg body weight, or HFOV using a frequency of 10-15 Hz [ 63 ] . Eligible infants were less than 4 h of age, had received one dose of surfactant, and required mechanical ventilation using a mean airway pressure >6 and an FiO 2 \u22650.25. These investigators were able to show that infants randomized to receive high-frequency oscillatory ventilation successfully separated from mechanical ventilation earlier than those assigned to a lung-sparing strategy of conventional ventilation. Those assigned to high-frequency ventilation also demonstrated a signifi cant reduction in the need for supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks postmenstrual age [ 63 ] . By defi ning a disease threshold in the study infants, adhering to lungprotective protocols for mechanical ventilation, and extubating from the assigned ventilator according to specifi c criteria, this study identifi ed a set of circumstances in which HFOV may be used with clear benefi t in preterm infants with RDS [ 63 ] . In contrast, the companion trial by Johnson and colleagues included healthier patients, used fewer defi ned protocols, and pursued more aggressive ventilator strategies. In both study arms, Johnson and colleagues targeted a PaCO 2 of 34-53 Torr, while Courtney and colleagues allowed more permissive levels of hypercapnea [ 63 ] . For those infants who were supported on HFOV, Johnson and colleagues initiated therapy at a frequency of 10 Hz, and if maximizing amplitude (\u2206P) did not achieve adequate CO 2 clearance, the frequency was subsequently reduced [ 64 ] . Finally, Johnson's group transitioned the majority of study infants to conventional ventilation for weaning after a median time on HFOV of 3 days, a relatively small proportion of the total time on mechanical ventilation [ 64 ] . This trial found no difference between groups in its composite primary outcome, death or chronic lung disease at 36 weeks postmenstrual age.",

It is possible that the rigorously controlled conditions in the Courtney study isolate the effect of HFOV with greater clarity. Their data suggest that only 11 infants need be supported with HFOV in order to prevent one occurrence of chronic lung disease at 36 weeks postmenstrual age [ 63 ] . Johnson's data suggest the number of infants needed to support on HFOV in order to prevent one occurrence of chronic lung disease is 50 [ 64 ] .

Over 15 years ago, consistent identifi cation of ventilator-induced lung injury on histopathology specimens recovered from CDH patients [ 66 , 67 ] began to focus attention on the possibility that aggressive ventilator strategies seeking to manipulate pulmonary vascular resistance through hyperventilation actually produce excess morbidity and mortality in this population. The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto and Children's Hospital Boston published tandem articles in 1997 in which they reviewed their CDH outcomes over a 14 year time span (1981) (1982) (1983) (1984) (1985) (1986) (1987) (1988) (1989) (1990) (1991) (1992) (1993) (1994) [ 66 , 67 ] . In each paper, outcomes were stratifi ed by time periods in which the prevailing management strategy was different than the one that the institution had used before. While overall survival for CDH was similar at each institution, both saw improved survival rates after instituting a strategy of permissive hypercapnea. In Boston, this difference achieved statistical signifi cance (69 % survival vs 44 %; p = 0.007) [ 68 ] . In Toronto, where clinicians tended to use HFOV more commonly for CDH than their Boston colleagues, the use of HFOV was not independently associated with improved survival [ 66 ] . By now a variety of centers have published case series in which infants with CDH demonstrate dramatic short term reductions in PaCO 2 and improvements in oxygenation when managed with HFOV [ 69 , 70 ] . Some of these reports appear to confi rm the Toronto experience that the use of HFOV may in fact be associated with an improvement in survival in this population [ 69 -71 ] .",

For those clinicians who opt to use HFOV for this population, it is essential to recognize that infants with CDH do not have inherently recruitable lungs. In this setting, attempts to improve gas exchange by applying high levels of mean airway pressure can actually increase the dead space fraction and may result in acute inflammatory injury, alveolar or airway rupture, or potentially dangerous elevations in pulmonary vascular resistance. For this reason, experienced centers often recommend limiting the mean airway pressure to 16 cm H 2 O or less [ 72 ] . The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto has developed an HFOV protocol that emphasizes maintaining preductal SaO 2 above 85 %, tolerating hypercarbia provided the pH is compensated, and initiation of HFOV when the peak inspiratory pressure on conventional (phasic) ventilation exceeds 25 cm H 2 O. This institution has reported significantly increased survival among CDH infants since implementing this set of guidelines in 1995 [ 72 ] .",

The investigators randomized 200 neonates with severe hypoxic respiratory failure and PPHN to receive therapy with either HFOV alone or conventional ventilation combined with iNO [ 73 ] . Crossover as a result of treatment failure resulted in combined therapy with HFOV and iNO. The study found that patients demonstrated signifi cant short-term improvements in PaO 2 during combined treatment with HFOV and iNO, after failing either therapy when it was delivered alone [ 73 ] . Combining HFOV and iNO was particularly effective among patients with severe parenchymal disease attributable to RDS and meconium aspiration [ 73 ] .

Although the OI is not a measure traditionally reported in the adult literature, it has been reported by some investigators as predictive of mortality in adult ARDS [ 82 ] . This trial was not powered to evaluate differences in mortality between the two groups, but there was a clear trend toward increased 30-day mortality among the patients randomized to receive conventional ventilation versus those who received HFOV (52 % vs. 37 %) [ 53 ] .",

The largest of these enrolled 61 patients [ 85 ] . All of these studies maintained HFOV at a frequency of 5 Hz or less, a practice now believed to generate tidal volumes approaching what would be delivered during conventional ventilation [ 44 , 89 ] . In 2007, Fessler and colleagues issued a consensus document in 2007 recommending that HFOV protocols for adult ARDS combine high amplitudes with the highest oscillatory frequency that will produce a target pH of 7.25-7.35 ( Fig. 10 .5 ) [ 44 ] . The large-scale, multicenter Oscil lation for A RDS T reated E arly (\"OSCILLATE\") trial was the fi rst to prospectively test this approach [ 90 ] . This trial was designed to evaluate the impact of highamplitude, maximal frequency HFOV against an \"open lung\", low tidal volume conventional ventilation strategy on all-cause hospital mortality for adults with ARDS. The investigators randomized 548 adults \u226516 years of age with acute hypoxic respiratory failure (PaO 2 /FiO 2 \u2264200 on standardized ventilator settings) and diffuse alveolar disease to receive either phasic ventilation targeting a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg and plateau pressure \u226435 cm H 2 O -or HFOV using the Sensormedics 3100B (CareFusion Corporation, Yorba Linda CA), oscillating at the highest possible frequency that would allow maintenance of an arterial pH >7.25. Both ventilator protocols targeted a PaO 2 55-80 Torr, guided by a standardized PEEP (or Paw)-FiO 2 grid, and both included recruitment maneuvers. Transition from HFOV to phasic ventilation and weaning from mechanical ventilatory support were strictly protocolized. Ultimately the steering committee terminated the OSCILLATE trial well short of its goal of enrolling 1,200 patients, after three consecutive interim analyses suggested an increase in mortality with HFOV. In the fi nal analysis, the HFOV group had an in-hospital mortality of 47 % compared to 35 % in the control group (RR for death with HFOV 1.33; 95 % CI 1.09-1.64, p = 0.005). This new and perhaps surprising development in the history of HFOV trials has several intriguing implications. As the OSCILLATE trial investigators suggest, it is possible that the theoretical benefi ts of maximal frequency (i.e., \"low stretch\") HFOV may be countered by deleterious effects from the high mean airway pressures that are typically required when using such a strategy [ 90 ] . The OSCILLATE trial outcomes may also compel clinicians to consider the possibility that HFOV may be a technique better suited to patients with diffuse alveolar disease and increased chest wall compliance-conditions that often coexist in infants and young children with acute lung injury and ARDS.",

Global measures of alveolar plateau pressure, tidal volume, and pulmonary mechanics that are available from breath to breath when using conventional ventilation are not provided on the high frequency ventilator console. The operator must often use intuition when adjusting ventilator settings, risking sudden and clinically significant de-recruitment or alveolar over-distension. In recent years, respiratory impedance plethysmography (RIP) and electrical impedance tomography (EIT) have emerged as two promising means by which pulmonary mechanics and alveolar recruitment can be assessed non-invasively at the bedside of patients receiving HFOV.",

In RIP, two elastic bands with Tefl on-coated wires embedded in a zig-zag distribution along their circumference are applied to the patient. One is typically placed around the chest, 3 cm above the xyphoid process, and the other is typically placed around the abdomen. Each of these two bands produces an independent signal and the sum of the two signals is calibrated against a known volume of gas. Use of this technique in association with HFOV has been validated in animal models [ 91 , 92 ] . In a large animal model of acute lung injury managed with HFOV, Brazelton and colleagues have demonstrated that RIP-derived lung volumes correlated well with those that were obtained using a supersyringe (r 2 = 0.78), and that RIP is capable of tracking global changes in lung volume and creating a pressure-volume curve during HFOV [ 91 ] . In a newborn animal model, Weber and colleagues were able to demonstrate that RIP is capable of detecting relative changes in pulmonary compliance that were induced by saline lavage [ 92 ] . Experience with RIP in human subjects is limited to investigations of its application during conventional ventilation. One study in adult patients [ 93 ] and another in pediatric patients [ 94 ] have utilized RIP to quantify the relative degree of de-recruitment that is associated with closed, inline techniques for endotracheal tube suctioning, as compared to open suctioning techniques. Each study was able to demonstrate a potential role for RIP in tracking global changes in lung volume at the bedside.",

Investigations using conventional ventilation in large animal models of lung injury have validated EIT against supersyringe methods for the determination of regional pressure-volume (or pressureimpedance ) curves [ 96 , 100 ] , and have demonstrated good correlation between EIT-derived regional changes in lung impedance and CT-derived regional variations in aeration [ 96 , 101 ] . Using EIT to track regional lung mechanics in a large animal model of acute lung injury managed with HFOV, van Genderingen and colleagues were able to demonstrate that regional pressure-volume curves constructed using maneuvers on HFOV show less variation along the gravitational axis compared with pressure-volume curves that are obtained using a supersyringe method, suggesting that recruitment is more uniformly distributed between dependent and non-dependent areas during HFOV [ 102 ] . Published experience with EIT in human subjects with acute lung injury or ARDS has correlated regional impedance changes induced by slow infl ation maneuvers using the DAS-01P EIT system (Sheffi eld, UK) with regional lung density measurements obtained by CT scanning [ 103 ] . A group of investigators at Children's Hospital Boston recently utilized EIT to detect regional changes in lung volume during a standardized suctioning maneuver in children with acute lung injury or ARDS who were supported on HFOV. These data demonstrate considerable regional heterogeneity in volume changes during a derecruitment maneuver (Fig. 10.8 ) [ 104 ] . The same investigators went on to correlate regional impedance changes with regional overdistension during HFOV in an animal model of acute lung injury, a fi nding bringing EIT research a step closer to identifying a precise role for this technology in the management of patients on HFOV [ 105 ] .",

Theoretically, this technology can create opportunities for therapeutic intervention by dynamically tracking the regional differences in alveolar recruitment that make portions of the lung highly susceptible to ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). However, there are important limitations to the presently available technology. For instance, substantial bias may be introduced into the EIT image because of the tendency for electrical current to follow the path of lowest impedance, rather than the path of shortest distance between the transmitting and receiving electrodes [ 97 ] . This phenomenon may account in large part for the variation between EIT measures of regional lung impedance and CT measures of regional lung density [ 103 ] . In addition, because EIT measures impedance changes that are relative to baseline values, changes in baseline regional intrathoracic impedance resulting from sources other than alterations in gas volume and distribution could lead to errors in the interpretation of EIT-derived data. Despite these limitations, several investigators have reported that EIT reliably detects regional alterations in pulmonary blood fl ow [ 106 ] and extravascular lung water [ 107 ] . In summary, identifying a useful role for EIT as an adjunct to HFOV at the bedside will depend on additional technical modifi cations to make it suitable for reliably detecting very small regional tidal volumes at high frequency in the electrically hostile environment of the intensive care unit.",

In general, when clinical improvement occurs to the point that Paw may be reduced to \u226420 cm H 2 O, FiO 2 is reduced to \u22640.4, and the patient tolerates endotracheal suctioning without signifi cant desaturation, it is appropriate to undertake a more detailed evaluation of the patient's response to phasic ventilation provided by conventional means [ 23 ] . This may be done by hand ventilating (with the aid of an in-line pneumotachometer, if necessary) while noting the pressures, tidal volume, and inspiratory to expiratory time ratio necessary to sustain satisfactory oxygen saturation. It is common to fi nd on transition to conventional ventilation that the patient will demonstrate satisfactory gas exchange on a mean airway pressure several cm H 2 O below the last Paw on HFOV.",

HFPV is a form of high frequency ventilation in which a single ventilator (Percussionaire Corporation, Sandpoint ID) coordinates the set parameters of both conventional ventilation and HFOV to deliver time-cycled, oscillatory, subphysiologic tidal volumes at approximately 3 Hz to at least 15 Hz. These are superimposed on time-cycled, pressure-limited tidal volumes (10-15/min) whose magnitude is determined by peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) and PEEP (CPAP) [ 108 ] . Oscillations during HFPV are created by a pneumatic \"Phasitron\u00ae\" (piston) positioned near the airway opening, which acts as both an inspiratory and expiratory valve and generates progressive, accumulative high velocity percussive waves that conduct into the lung. The net effect is a multiphasic oscillatory pattern that hits its maximum pressure during inspiration and its minimum pressure during expiration, when the lung recoils to the set PEEP (CPAP) level ( Fig. 10.9 ) [ 108 , 109 ] . The overall architecture of the respiratory cycle during HFPV is perhaps responsible for the observation that many patients can tolerate it without the need for neuromuscular blockade [ 108 , 110 ] . During HFPV, the operator controls PIP, PEEP (CPAP), inspiratory time, expiratory time, percussive rate, and \"conventional\" rate [ 108 ] .",

            "text": "Proponents of HFPV contend that it enhances tidal convective CO 2 clearance while augmenting oxygen diffusion through high velocity fl ow, in the manner common to all high frequency techniques [ 108 , 109 ] . In addition, percussive waves are believed to promote the clearance of airway secretions and debris, a process that is further potentiated by periodic lung recoil [ 108 , 111 ] . This is the rationale underlying the use of HFPV in patients with inhalational lung injury, although published studies examining the impact of HFPV on the incidence of pulmonary infection have shown confl icting results [ 112 -115 ] . A variety of reports ranging from small case series [ 116 -123 ] to case control studies [ 112 , 113 ] and small-scale prospective randomized trials [ 114 -116 , 124 -128 ] , have documented improved CO 2 clearance and oxygenation effi ciency at lower PIPs, when comparing HFPV to \"traditional\", high tidal volume conventional venti-lation in neonates, children, and adults. There is a single published trial examining the effi cacy of HFPV relative to lung protective ventilation using a modifi ed version of the ARDSnet protocol [ 16 , 115 ] . The incidence of ventilatorassociated pneumonia, diagnosed by contemporary consensus criteria, was examined as a secondary outcome measure in this trial. The investigators randomized 62 burned adult patients with acute respiratory failure to either HFPV or conventional ventilation using tidal volumes of 6 mL/kg predicted body weight and plateau pressure limitation to \u226430 cm H 2 O. Only a portion (37 %) of the study population had documented inhalational injury. In the HFPV cohort, the investigators reported signifi cant reductions in PIP up to 5 days following randomization. However, this did not translate to an overall difference in the study's primary outcome measure, ventilator-free days in the fi rst 28 days of the trial [ 115 ] . Signifi cantly more patients in the conventional ventilation arm of this trial experienced new airleak or otherwise unexplained pneumatocele (13 % vs 0 %; p = 0.04). There was a trend toward reduced incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia in the HFPV arm, but this difference did not achieve statistical signifi cance (32 % vs 52 % p = 0.12). There was no difference in plasma cytokine levels between study groups. Signifi cantly more patients in the conventional ventilation arm required a rescue mode of ventilation for failure to meet predetermined ventilation and/or oxygenation goals (29 % vs 6 %; p = 0.02), a fi nding which closed the trial short of its goal of enrolling 170 patients. Thus, the available evidence suggests that HFPV is associated with short-term improvements in the effi ciency of gas exchange among lung injured patients, but clinical trials have not yet confi rmed a clear advantage of this modality over current best practices for either conventional ventilation or HFOV. In particular, the impact of the larger, low frequency tidal volumes on the infl ammatory response and overall course of lung injured Pressure-time waveform during HFPV (\"convective pressure rise\" feature engaged): stepwise progression to end inspiratory pressure is depicted. At the beginning of inspiration, oscillatory pressures reach an initial plateau. A \"convective pressure rise\" carries the breath toward the peak equilibrium pressure, which is then released at the end of inspiration toward the baseline PEEP (CPAP). In this tracing, oscillations are activated during both the inspiratory and the expiratory phase (From The VDR-4 Manual of Understanding [ 109 ] , used with permission granted by Dr. Forrest Bird) patients managed with HFPV has yet to be fully elucidated [ 110 ] . Additional study will be needed before more widespread use of this modality outside of a controlled investigational setting would be justifi ed.",
