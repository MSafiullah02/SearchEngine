The changes of airborne NO 2 plummets over COVID-19-hit area after lockdown. In 146 East Asia (Figure 2a), satellite images show that compared to before the blockade, the total 147 emissions of NO 2 in eastern China have significantly decreased by approximately 56.6%. In 148 South Korea, the monthly NO 2 emissions have also been reduced by approximately 18.0 %. The 149 local government has implemented the most expansive testing programme and has isolated 150 people infected with the virus without locking down entire cities, and the sharp decrease in NO 2 151 may be linked to the reduction in local emissions and pollutant transport from surrounding 152 areas 22,23 . Japan has not imposed widespread lockdown policies, and a 4.8% increase in NO 2 the north (82.4%), where the outbreak is the most severe. This could be due to the 156 reduction in road traffic and the decrease in economic activities in the industrial heartland as a 157 result of the widespread lockdown policy 10 . Other countries such as Germany, Denmark, and 158 Poland also experienced notable reductions. This is consistent with the results of the European 159 Environment Agency (EEA) 24 . However, in certain areas, such as northern and southern Spain, 160 the NO 2 concentration has risen, possibly because of lax closure measures and increased 161 emissions from coal-fired power plants 25 . In the United States (Figure 2c), one month after the 162 lockdown, the overall decline in NO 2 is relatively small. The worst affected states, such as New 163 York, Washington and California, still contain areas with increased NO 2 concentrations, and the 164 NO 2 concentration is increasing significantly in the vast midwestern regions that have not The relative variation in the monthly average tropospheric NO 2 concentration 168 before and after the lockdown. a, Relative variation in East Asia. b, Relative variation in 169 Western Europe. c, Relative variation in North America.

After the strict city lockdown, the NO 2 concentration in the main 173 virus-affected cities in China decreased significantly (Figure 3). Consistent with the satellite data, 174 the ground monitoring results showed that compared to the conditions before the closure, the 175 monthly average NO 2 concentration after the lockdown decreased approximately 55.7% (95% CI: 176 51.5-59.6%). Since the lockdown, the total number of confirmed new cases reaches an inflection 177 point after approximately two weeks (the incubation period of the virus is 14 days), and 178 compared to the period of 1-15 days after the closure, the total number of confirmed new cases in 179 the 16-30 days after the closure has decreased 73.6% (95% CI: 64.9-81.1%). The most 180 significant improvement was recorded in Hangzhou, where the NO 2 concentration decreased 181 approximately 68.1%, and the total number of confirmed new cases declined the most. Likewise, 182 Zhengzhou, Changsha, Guangzhou, and Nanchang are good examples. Wuhan, the worst 183 virus-affected area in China, also exhibited a downward trend. The total number of confirmed 184 new cases reached 13,436 on February 12 due to the inclusion of clinically diagnosed cases 26 , 185 resulting in a new delayed peak in the figure. 186",

The temporal evolution of the NO 2 concentration with the total number of confirmed 199 new cases in the COVID-19-hit areas globally. After the countries severely affected by 200 COVID-19 implemented strict lockdown measures, satellite data showed a significant decline in 201 NO 2 emissions, and the total confirmed new cases decreased after two weeks in most areas 202 (Figure 4). As a result, the strict lockdown of COVID-19-hit areas other than those in China is 203 also effective and easy to implement to prevent the spread of the virus. The lockdown measures 204 might have already prevented tens of thousands of deaths in Europe 28 . In Italy, where the 205 epidemic is widespread, after the lockdown the NO 2 emissions significantly decreased by an 206 average of 36.6%, and the total confirmed new cases reached an inflection point 12 days later, have been averted in this country due to the implemented intervention measures 28 . 209 The occurrence time of the inflection point is mainly related to the magnitude of NO 2 decline. In 210 France, NO 2 declined less (27.1%), and the time for the total number of confirmed new cases to 211 reach an inflection point was delayed. In Germany, the NO 2 emissions decreased the most, by 212 54.7%, and the total number of confirmed new cases reached an inflection point within 8 days 213 after lockdown, which occurred earlier than in other countries. For Iran and Switzerland, due to 214 the relatively low number of confirmed cases, with the decline of NO 2 after the strict control, 215 confirmed new cases also reached the inflection point earlier. In the the worst-affected states, 216 United States, NO 2 emissions decreased by an average of 43.1% in New York, Washington and 217 California, and the total confirmed new cases dropped significantly, showing signs of easing. 218 Temporal variation in the NO 2 concentration and number of new cases in the 220 COVID-19-hit areas.
