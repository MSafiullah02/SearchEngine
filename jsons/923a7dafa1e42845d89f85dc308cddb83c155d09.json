In addition, dendrimers are well-defined nano-sized symmetric polymeric molecules. In this review, we provide an analysis of the use of dendrimers modified with aptamers as nonviral vectors to specifically target tumor cells. Various anticancer agents have been encapsulated with dendrimers complexing with aptamers, including epirubicin, camptothecin, Bcl-xL short hairpin (sh)RNA, and 5-fluorouracil rhodamine-labeled dextran. Other types of polymeric nanoparticle (NP)-aptamer bioconjugates have also been developed and loaded with Pt(IV) derivatives, to target specific tumor cells.",

Teaser: We discuss the development of dendrimer-and polymeric nanoparticle-aptamer bioconjugates as a new approach in medicine Aptamer-based tools for therapeutic monitoring for precision therapy Aptamer comes from the Latin 'aptare' meaning to fit together or join, and from the Greek 'meros' meaning part. A nucleic acid aptamer is a short chain of artificial oligonucleotides of RNA or single-stranded DNA with a variable region of ~40-100 nucleotide bases [1] . Their unique, flexible 3D structure, and their high affinity and specificity with ligand-binding capabilities, are strongly related to their sequence. These important characteristics increase their ability to differentiate between targets. In contrast to antibodies, aptamers can bind to functional domains of their cognate target protein (e.g., substrate binding pockets and allosteric sites) (Figure 1) [2]. Aptamers are considered to be 'smart ligands' and are often named 'nucleic acid antibodies'. The binding between aptamers and user-defined targets occurs through electrostatic interactions, which result in their versatility. The strong binding affinity and exceptional specificity induces a nano-or pico-molar dissociation constant (Kd). Their targets vary from small ions, such as Zn 2+, and large proteins, such as coagulation factor VIII, to whole cells, viruses, and tissues [3].",

From a drug discovery point of view, aptamers also have the following advantages over traditional antibodies: (i) thermally stability; (ii) less batch variability; (iii) short production time; and (iv) low cost. Importantly, large quantities of aptamers can be obtained using biochemical synthesis, such as the systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX), high-throughput aptamer identification screens (HAPIscreen), and nonequilibrium capillary electrophoresis of equilibrium mixture (NECEEM).

To avoid this degradation, several modifications of RNA aptamers have been performed to improve their bioavailability and the pharmacokinetic parameters: (i) 2-fluoro pyrimidine modifications; (ii) 2-O-methyl nucleotides; (iii) 3-end cap; and (iv) introduction of cholesterol or polyethylene glycol (PEG) as anchor groups [4] .",

            "text": "The chemistry of dendrimers was first introduced in 1978 by Fritz Vogtle and coworkers, as well as by Tomalia et al. Numerous biological studies using dendrimers have been carried out, as reviewed elsewhere [16] [17] [18] [19] . Dendrimers represent a unique class of polymers, with highly branched 3D architectures, the shape and size of which can be precisely controlled. Size is one of the most important parameters to be evaluated, because it strongly influences clearance kinetics, biodistribution, and in vivo efficacy. NPs >200 nm in size generally induce immune responses and are absorbed by Kupffer cells, which are an important component of the mononuclear phagocytic system. By contrast, smaller NPs (<150 nm) induced rapid clearance from circulation, with NPs <10 nm being easily cleared through the kidney or lymph nodes [14] . Dendrimers display an exponential number of dendritic branches (hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties) radiating out from a central core unit. Figure 2 shows the structural units of the well-known poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers, such as core, surface groups, void spaces, and interior branching. Interior layers (generations, Gn, where n is generally from 1 to 6, and more exceptionally up to 12 and recently even 13) comprise regularly repeating branching units attached to the core [20] . As shown in Figure 3 , the dendrimers can encapsulate biologically active compounds (yellow balls) as well as conjugate molecules (violet balls). Dendrimers can also be used as drugs (active per se) [21] . The dendrimer diameter increases linearly whereas the number of surface groups and the molecular weight increases exponentially for each generation ( Figure 2) . Importantly, the dendrimer collection, based on multiple variations of their chemical structure, allows the monitoring of the chemical properties of core, branches, and surface groups by the introduction of varied chemical groups (basic, acidic, hydrophobic, hydrogen-bonding capability, charges, etc.) [22] . These fine-tuning chemical transformations allow modification of the composition, architecture, and properties of dendrimers, and are key physicochemical properties to improve their in vitro [23] and in vivo [24] behaviors.",

Clinical administration of Epi (e.g., to breast and colon cancers) has been limited by nonspecific interactions inducing cardiotoxicity and bone marrow suppression. Consequently, the development of a new nanosystem, avoiding these adverse effects, was needed. The new strategy is based on the preferential accumulation of chemotherapeutic agents at the cancer site, consequently decreasing the adverse effects. The MUC1 aptamer selectively binds to the transmembrane glycosylated mucin-1 (glycoprotein), which is overexpressed in many tumors, whereas the single-stranded AS1411 aptamer (ATPAS1411, a 26-mer DNA aptamer with the sequence: 5'-Thiol-C6 linker-GGTGGTGGTGGTTGTGGTGGTGGTGG 3') specifically binds to the nucleus membrane protein nucleolin, which is overexpressed on the plasma membrane of tumor cells. The authors designed and developed an original nanosystem, based on an aptamer-dendrimer conjugate (generation 3), to deliver Epi to MCF-7 breast cancer cells and murine C26 colon carcinoma cells in the presence of two aptamers (MUC1 and AS1411) as targeting agents on the DNA nanostructure surface. The size of the chemically stable G3 aptamer-dendrimer was 36.4 nm. Based on fluorescence intensity and gel retardation assays, the formation of the dendriplex was analyzed, and the maximum quenching ratio was ~1:25 dendrimer/Epi, corresponding to 25 mole Epi loaded in 1 mole G3 aptamer-dendrimer. The release of Epi from the aptamerdendrimer-Epi complex was pH dependent, with the more rapid release of Epi in acidic pH (pH 5.5, as in cancerous tissues and lysosomes) versus physiological pH: 63% of Epi was released at pH 5.5 and 15% at pH 7.4 (72 h, 37\u00b0C). The probable protonation of Epi leads to a decrease in the interactions between Epi and dendrimer. Nevertheless, this process is not unique because catalytic enzymes from lysosomes should participate in the disassembly of the dendrimer, inducing the release of Epi.",

One of the problems of the drug delivery system is the inability to discriminate target cells from nontarget cells, which could result in off-target delivery. Specific drug delivery approaches used cell surface receptors that are overexpressed on the surface of tumor cells. After binding the aptamers to the cell surface receptors, internalization of the aptamerreceptor complexes occurs via a receptor-mediated endocytic pathway process, finally allowing delivery of the loaded drugs. The targeted delivery of chemotherapeutic agents, for instance, could increase their efficacy and reduce their off-target effects. The efficiency of the AS1411-loading and camptothecin-encapsulating content was 8.1% and 93.67%, respectively. The in vitro release assay of camptothecin demonstrated a sustained release of the anticancer agent over 4 days in both phosphate buffer saline (PBS, pH 7.4) and citrate buffer (pH 5.5). Compared with PEG-PAMAM-CPT, the targeted Apt-PEG-PAMAM-CPT formulation displayed a slower CPT release profile because of the decreased diffusion rate of CPT from cavities of dendrimers after the dendrimer periphery was further modified with the aptamer.",

Bcl-xL is expressed in several solid tumors, such as neuronal tumors, adenocarcinoma, bladder cancers, and gastric cancer.

The charge of all dendriplexes after aptamer conjugations were positive (12.76-19.13 mV) . Immunocytochemistry analysis showed the presence of nucleolin receptors on the surface of A549 cells (adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cells) but not on L929 cells (negative control). The transfection efficiency of complexes was evaluated in nucleolin-expressing A549 cells, using L929 cells as negative control, and clearly showed strong transfection efficacy with polyplexes bearing covalent or noncovalent aptamers versus nontargeted vectors in A549 cells; noncovalent conjugation also exhibited more efficiency compared with covalent binding. Notably, all the polyplexes prepared showed >70% viability with or without the AS1411 aptamer. Based on Western blot analyses of the expression level of Bcl-xL in A549 cells, its expression was reduced by ~55% with polyplexes bearing shRNA versus polyplexes bearing scrambled shRNA. The complexes with aptamer only, or with scrambled shRNA, did not significantly change the protein expression level. These results showed the high silencing of Bcl-xL expression by shRNA using G4 PAMAM dendrimers bearing the AS411 aptamer compared with the PAMAM dendrimer without an aptamer. The active polyplex also induced apoptosis in A549 target cells, as validated by flow cytometric analysis.",

This NP encapsulated rhodamine-labeled dextran as a model of drug, and conjugating aptamer, A10 PSAM, as a targeting agent. A 5\uf0a2-FITC-label compound was linked to the end of the aptamers to analyze the specific binding of membrane surface interactions using light transmission or fluorescent microscopy techniques. These negatively surface-charged NPs (-50 mV) minimized the nonspecific interactions with the negatively charged nucleic acid RNA aptamers, whereas the PEG chains enhanced the circulating half-life and contributed to the decreased uptake in nontargeted cells. These microNP-aptamer bioconjugates showed a narrow size distribution. The PEGylated NPs efficiently targeted prostate LNCaP (PSMA + ) epithelial cells [with a 77-fold increase in binding versus PC3 (PSMA -) cells as a control]. More importantly, these NPs did not targeted cells where no expression of PSA occurred. The binding of the NPs to LNCaP epithelial cells was easily detectable in an early-stage evaluation.

The A10 aptamer was identified using the SELEX technique, and targeted PSMA in vitro and in vivo. The fluorescence dye Cy5 was also used to initiate LA polymerization, resulting in Cy5-PLA NPs (Cy5-PLA-NCs), which were then co-precipitated with a PLA-PEG-CO2H polymer, resulting in PLA-PEG-CO2H/Cy5-PLA-NCs NPs. These NPs had a size of 132.8 nm and a polydispersity of 0.031. Condensation of the A10 aptamer with the carboxylic functions of PLA-PEG-CO2H/Cy5-PLA-NCs resulted in aptamer/PLA-PEG-CO2H/Cy5-PLA-NCs (size: 157.1 nm, polydispersity: 0.144). Confocal images showed that the uptake of NPs coated with the aptamer was significantly enhanced versus the uncoated NPs in LNCaP (PSMA + ). In the same assay, no difference between coated and uncoated nanoparticles was observed in PC3 cells (PSMA -). The binding of coated NPs were higher than that of uncoated NPs in LNCaP cells, but no difference was observed in PC3 cells.",

To increase the biostability, for example against nuclease hydrolysis in human serum, several strategies have been developed based on polymer-aptamer conjugates [32] : (i) 3\uf0a2 and 5\uf0a2-biotin-aptamer conjugates [33] ; (ii) cholesterol and lipid moiety conjugates [34] ; (iii) 5\uf0a2-end PEGylation conjugates [35] ; (iv) modifications of the sugar ring of the aptamers [36] ; (v) 4\uf0a2-oxygen replacement of the aptamers [37] ; (vi) modification of the phosphodiester linkage and bases of the aptamers [38] ; and (vii) direct conjugation of aptamers to NPs, generally via a spacer or a linker to maintain aptamer-binding activity. Examples of such approaches include: (i) an antinucleolin-specific DNA aptamer (AS1411) linked to DOX-loaded liposomes [39] and a AS1411 aptamer conjugated to liposomes with cisplatin [40] ; (ii) an aptamer functionalized on the surface of PLGA-b-PEG-CO2H-based NPs [41] ; (iii) quantum dot-MUC1 aptamers [42] ; and (iv) thiolated nucleic acids functionalized on gold NPs (AuNPs) [43] . There appear to be some similarities in morphology between multivalent polymer-aptamer and dendrimer-aptamer conjugates, although further research is required to confirm these. A 3\uf0a2-biotin-modified-DNA aptamer targeting severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus helicase has also been reported [33] .",

In addition, aptamers can be used in biomarker discovery, drug discovery, diagnostics, and therapeutics, where traditional antibodies cannot. Specialized delivery vehicles, such as dendrimers, coating specific aptamers, represent a novel approach to tackle tumor cells that overexpress the corresponding antigens, such as prostate LNCaP (PSMA + ) epithelial cells. Here, we have highlighted and analyzed the use of engineered dendrimers and polymers as nonviral carriers, targeting specific tumors based on the binding of aptamers to their respective biomarkers on the surface of the tumor cells, and the subsequent, controlled release of chemotherapeutic drugs. However, few in vivo studies have been performed using dendrimer-aptamer bioconjugates. Thus, there is a need for additional in vivo studies. Such studies are required to evaluate the biodistribution of these vehicles after systemic administration, as well as their anticancer properties. The selective delivery of a therapeutic dose of a drug is a major advantage of this type of NP. Lastly, more broadly, these powerful nanodrugs could be developed for the specific targeted drug delivery to treat myriad diseases.",
