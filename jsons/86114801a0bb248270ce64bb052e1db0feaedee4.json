For India, it is an important decision to come up with a non-pharmaceutical control strategy such as nationwide lockdown for 40 days to prolong the higher phases of COVID-19 and to avoid severe load on its public health-care system. As the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak remains a global threat, it is a challenge for all the countries to come up with effective public health and administrative strategies to battle against COVID-19 and sustain their economies. *",

The number of cases in India seems to be steadily growing amid nationwide lockdown. With the fast spreading of COVID-19, the global numbers have reached almost 3 million which is concerning national and international agencies. Researchers across the globe are working on developing a vaccine and antiviral drugs to fight Covid-19. UK have recently started a vaccine trial on humans [4] .

Gauging these challenges in advance, Indian government took a smart and rapid decision going for nationwide lockdown which is considered as the globally most stringent measure to prolong the country's entry into phase 3; a community transmission mode [6] . This seems to work quite well for India controlling its volume of infection compared to enormous volumes of infected cases reported for countries like Italy, Spain and USA. However, India still has some challenges standing ahead like presence of large number of asymptomatic individuals predicted by its national medical research council, increase in number of tests to be done per day and per state, reliable antibody diagnostic kits for rapid testing of suspected individuals infected with COVID-19, requirements of critical health care considering disparity in its health infrastructure and coordination among various central and state government agencies. Indian Railways have come up with an innovative approach by converting train coaches into health care facilities if a situation arises with large volumes of infected cases [7] . Health ministry in India has launched a mobile application known as Aarogya Setu (Health Bridge) to track individual health status and currently putting efforts to increase its users [8] . Indias national medical council has recently launched a pool testing method for RT-PCR diagnosis to narrow down local areas affected with COVID-19 cases which help in identifying infected individuals for their immediate isolation [9] .",

Hence, a new compartment of exposed individuals E is introduced, which contains individuals who are infected but yet to become infectious. The SEIR model is an extensively used epidemiological model based on the work of Kermack and McKendrick [23] .

The transmission potential of infectious disease may change over time and thus, R 0 may also change over time. There are several ways to estimate the variation of R 0 with time and in this paper we restrict ourselves to not get into the methods of R 0 estimation. Instead, we optimize the parameters of the SEIR model described above to generate plots for active infected cases based on the observed data of COVID-19 cases. Continuing with this approach, we also analyze the effects of lockdown to project the growth of active infected cases during the lockdown and after it is removed. Based on the SEIR model, we discuss the effectiveness of control strategies. The value of R 0 for COVID-19 is estimated to be between 2 and 3 [24] . Another approach of computing R 0 involves the processing discrete time series data for active infected cases, recovered cases and deaths. For advanced analysis, the SEIR model can be further modified to estimate the effect of various conditions such as quarantine, meta populations and presence of asymptomatic cases. The data of confirmed, recovered and death cases due to COVID-19 spread is obtained from https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19 repository. This data repository for the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Visual Dashboard is operated by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE). Also, it is supported by ESRI Living Atlas Team and the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab (JHU APL). The active infected cases are estimated by subtracting recovered and death cases from the confirmed cases. Python open source programming is used for analysis and fitting the data.",

Therefore, we decided to use the COVID-19 data of South Korea to test the efficiency and feasibility of our SEIR model and fitting procedure. For fitting our model to South Korea, certain parameters in the SEIR model like transmission rate, \u03b2 were optimized during the fitting procedure. We have used the incubation period of 2 days (\u03b3=0.2) and recovery time as 26 days (\u03c3 = 0.0385) for our fitting [25] . For optimization of our fit, we have minimized chi-square for varying values of \u03b2 and initial susceptible population (N). This helped us to determine pairs of N and \u03b2 which gave the best fit to the data for active infected cases.The chi-square is given by the following equation,",

The fitting of a model is highly dependent on the length of observed data taken into consideration. Fitting the model for small length of the data especially during the onset of exponential growth, the number of cases is low compared to expected numbers during the complete dynamics. Hence, fitting may not be very accurate for a smaller length of the data for any forecasting. started emerging in India a bit later in time compared to its onset in other countries, the COVID-19 outbreak in India is in the growth phase. India has implemented hard lockdown very early which seems to help in controlling the transmission. To give the projection of infected active cases based on current lockdown condition and to investigate if the lockdown is removed on May 3, 2020 how the curve will evolve, we have fitted the SEIR model with chi-square optimization. First, we fitted the model for varying size of data. Figure 4 shows the predicted curves from this analysis. The variation in predicted curves due to varying size of data is evident. However, considering current data of 86 days from its onset in India, the predicted curve(dashed green line) shows a nice fit to the reported cases. Assuming the projected trends of 75 and 86 days are more reliable, we observe that peak active infected cases could reach around 42000-70000 by mid May, 2020 in India. Moreover, we evaluated the impact of the possible lockdown removal on May 3, 2020 using our model. The \u03b2 value for the ongoing lockdown period is 0.19, we assumed that the \u03b2 could increase after lockdown removal. The \u03b2 value will change as control measures are removed either fully or partially [26] . It is difficult to quantify the exact value of beta after lockdown period, therefore, we project possible scenarios for 25% (\u03b2=0.23), 50% (\u03b2=0.28), 75% (\u03b2=0.33), and 100% (\u03b2=0.38) increase in the current \u03b2 value (0. 19) . Table 1 summarizes the projected active infected cases if lockdown is continued and different scenarios for postlockdown situations. Figure 5 depicts the curves for different \u03b2 values forecasting the scenario after lockdown removal in comparison to the predicted curve for active infected cases (dashed blue line) based on current data.",

To start with, we used data of COVID-19 from South Korea showing all the phases of active infected cases over time to validate our model. Then, we used the chi-square minimization process to obtain best fitted parameters for South Korea and India. This enabled us to forecast the peak of active infected cases for India. It is found that with respect to the ongoing lockdown situation in India, the peak of active infected cases will occur in Mid of May, 2020 with a maximum number of 43,000. Our study shows that the infected cases will tend to cease by the mid of August, 2020 if lockdown is continued. Interestingly, our predicted peak time is very much consistent with the predictions made by Protiviti, a global consulting firm. In our model, we consider different values of beta (other than for the lockdown condition; \u03b2 = 0.19) to provide insight on the relative strengths of control measures taken by the government. Lower the value of beta, indicates a relatively better strategy to control the spread. The removal of lockdown on May 3, 2020 may lead to \u223c 21 % increase (corresponding value of transmission rate, \u03b2 = 0.38) in the peak value of active infected cases as compared to the peak value predicted for ongoing lockdown. This increase is due to the exposed individuals or asymptomatic individuals who may actively transmit in post-lockdown period. Therefore, it is highly important to identify such exposed and asymptomatic individuals in post-lockdown period. Increasing the number of tests for early identification of COVID-19 cases during the lockdown period will certainly help in understanding the real picture of infected volume. Mobile applications or web GIS applications integrated with GPS which are capable of tracking regular geo-spatial movements and health status of individuals can provide useful data [27] . If an individual is found infected, such applications will help to trace the possible spread of disease in the post-lockdown period.",

Lockdown removal strategies have to be smartly designed which do not allow estimated infected volumes centered around these zones to grow. Model based forecasts of peak values will certainly help decision makers, especially public health and administrative departments of the state and central governments to assess their preparedness, control the pandemic and repair the socio-economic damage caused by the pandemic.
