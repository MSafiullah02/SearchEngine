Nevertheless, repeated exposure to these substances can lead to chronic cumulative ICD (Figure 1), mainly due to their capacity to remove skin surface lipids, damage skin proteins, denature epidermal keratin, and even induce alteration of the cell membrane of keratinocytes [5]. Furthermore, patients with a personal or family history of atopic dermatitis have a chronically dysfunctional cutaneous barrier that increases their sensitivity to skin irritants (Figure 2) [6]. Rarely, some individuals may even develop ACD (Figure 3), a T-cell-mediated, delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction, to an ingredient in a hand hygiene-related product, such as soaps or detergents [7].",

On the other hand, allergy against alcohol itself is unknown and ACD attributable to other compounds added to alcoholic hand gels is extremely rare.
