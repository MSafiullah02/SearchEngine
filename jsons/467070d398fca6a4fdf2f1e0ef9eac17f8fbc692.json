Around the world, including in the United States, elective surgeries are being deferred and orthopaedic residents and fellows are being asked to make drastic changes to their daily routines. In the midst of these changes are unique opportunities for resident/fellow growth and development. Educational tools in the form of web-based learning, surgical simulators, and basic competency tests may serve an important role. Challenges are inevitable, but appropriate preparation may help programs ensure continued resident growth, development, and well-being while maintaining high-quality patient care.",

Orthopaedic surgeons, including residents and fellows in-training, have not been immune to these changes. As many hospitals have canceled elective surgeries, orthopaedic case volume has dwindled drastically. 2 There has also been a growing emphasis on maintaining the health of care providers on the front line, including the resident and fellow workforce. Owing to these factors, orthopaedic surgery departments have established a list of priorities to guide administrative and organizational actions during this time (Table 1) . Although the pandemic presents a number of challenges, preparation and planning will contribute to continued learning and unique opportunities for resident/fellow growth and development.",

            "text": "Many departments have adopted a residency surge plan. 3 Under such a strategy, a portion of the residents are assigned to hospital duties (ie, direct patient care, rounding on inpatients, and covering urgent surgeries), whereas the remainder are quarantined to their home environment ( Figure 1 ). Doing so ensures that urgent orthopaedic care can continue to be provided. Although research has widely reported that COVID-19 causes only mild symptoms in individuals in their twenties and thirties with few medical comorbidities (most resident/fellow physicians), 4 a situation in which an entire residency program falls ill with the highly virulent COVID-19 would be potentially catastrophic. In addition, if a large group of residents contract the virus with little to no symptoms, they may unintentionally expose a large number of vulnerable patients or other healthcare workers to the pathogen. The surge plan and its early adoption help mitigate these possibilities. It is anticipated that inpatient demand for COVID-19 will overwhelm the hospital capacity through the summer and possibly the fall of 2020. 1 Orthopaedic surgery residents are already being redeployed to ICUs and emergency departments, where coverage is stretched and thin. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) and the American Board or Orthopaedic Surgery (ABOS) currently mandate that first year orthopaedic surgery residents receive 6 months of nonorthopaedic education, including 3 months of general surgery and 3 months of structured training chosen from specialties such as anesthesia, emergency medicine, intensive care, or anesthesia/airway management. 5 The goal of these rotations is to \"foster proficiency in the basic surgical skills, the perioperative care of surgical patients, medical management of patients, and airway management skills.\" Although many residents/fellows are several years removed from these rotations, the foundations for success are still present. Moreover, reassignment to a medical, anesthesia, or intensivist service may serve a good reminder that although we identify as orthopaedic surgeons, we are first and foremost medical doctors.",

In response, residency and fellowship programs must consider unique and novel avenues of learning. Weekly meetings and conferences that previously took place in person can be carried out using virtual meeting spaces. In response to the European working time regulations, which were changes analogous to the ACGME duty hour restrictions, Palan et al 6 reported their experience in establishing and conducting virtual learning platforms and virtual journal clubs to help optimize resident time spent away from the hospital. The team found a number of unique strengths relative to a traditional in-person learning format, including the ability to revisit the digitally recorded session for clarification or continued learning, ease of access to both clinical material (ie, radiographs and advance imaging) and key articles, and the ability to connect individuals of different geographic regions. Similar practices must be adopted, given the current circumstances.",

Given the decrease in clinical duties and the ease of use of the virtual meeting spaces, these conferences have since been opened up to all residents hoping to attend.

Surgical simulation is a powerful tool that can help meet this training demand. As Great Britain's former Chief Medical Officer Sir Liam Donaldson once said, \"If I had to have my gallbladder out, I would rather it was done by someone who had already done 100 in a simulator.\" 15 Various simulation modalities studied in orthopaedic surgery have included surgical skill laboratories, 16 cadaveric dissection and procedural training, 17 computer-based virtual reality training, 18 and arthroscopic surgery simulation. 19 Despite their promise of improved surgical education, high \"observational\" surgical volume, and time spent on direct patient care have been major barriers to widespread adoption.

These assessments have been publicized and validated across a number of subspecialties, including hand and wrist surgery, 21 shoulder surgery, 22 and arthroscopic knee surgery. 23 The tools provide objective scores that are simple to record and track over time. In the setting of COVID-19, potential methods of use include recording a baseline OSATS or Global Rating Scales score of particular interest at the time of initial home duty (eg, the carpal tunnel OSATS 24 for a resident assigned to the hand service) and ensuring that this score can be matched on the resident's return to the workforce.

The remainder of time is filled with independent study, research, or webinars made available through the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons or the subspecialty societies.

At our programs, for instance, each resident sends their mutually-selected mentor(s) a weekly list of projects they have been working on and the progress made over the past week. They are encouraged to attend research team meetings that have also successfully transitioned to the virtual setting. Fourth-year residents also regularly communicate with their mentors regarding fellowship options and for guidance regarding their respective rank lists.

In addition, as previously mentioned, program leadership should maintain an account of team-based and independent resident learning during this time away from traditional clinical rotations. This includes taking attendance of general and subspecialty conferences, having residents/fellows submit proof of completed questions on a particular subspecialty, and recording progress in research efforts. In doing so, this too may help satisfy the ABOS guidelines regarding resident time spent on subspecialty services, helping to avoid delays in resident advancement and graduation for years to come. 12 Finally, forced reorganization may enable administrators to take a step back and examine their program, identify the areas of potential improvement, and propose beneficial changes once COVID-19 has resolved. One must not forget that many of the powerful changes in resident education were born out of periods of change and uncertainty. For example, the ACGME was founded in 1981 in response to a concerning degree of variability in the quality of resident education. 30 Duty hour limits were redefined in 2011 because of major concerns of resident fatigue and safety issues. 31 The accreditation system was overhauled in 2013 in response to claims that resident ability to innovate and express themselves had disappeared. 32 During the COVID-19 pandemic and this unique time of redefined roles, breaks from traditional resident rotations and a re-emphasis on medicine, program directors, and the orthopaedic leadership share another opportunity to consider and execute changes to stimulate resident education for the coming decade.",

As of March 2020, the ABOS had notified senior residents that they are still planning to administer the part 1 examination in July 2020, as previously planned.
