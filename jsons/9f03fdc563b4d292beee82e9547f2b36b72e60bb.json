First, the COVID-19 easily spreads among all people that facing with patients. The second, direct contact with infected people can easily transmit the disease.Third, despite enough skill knowledge of nurses in their exposures to infected patients, they can be affected very quickly. Because at the the beginning of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Iran, there were no enough protection against this infection. In this case, staff of this hospital managed patients with COVID-19 similar with rotine infections. The fourth point of this study is COVID-19 can affect all people, whether those who observe the safety points incompletely or those who do not observe at all. The fifth point is COVID-19 can affect the whole age group of the society.Our results of the CT scan showed that their lungs were incompletely involved.Their lung tissue was partially destroyed, however, Nanshan Chen et al showed that there was an extensive conflict at the level of the lungs of patients with COVID-19. On the other hand, there was a conflict between the results of this study, because one out of five patients has abnormal HRCT but all of them have positive for the real-time PCR. Therefore in this study, the real-time PCR was better in the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. As confirmed in previous finding the real-time PCR is accepted as a standard method of COVID-19 diagnosis.",
