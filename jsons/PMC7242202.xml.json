As a matter of fact, the pandemic COVID-19 determined recently a very significant increase of admissions to intensive care unit (ICU) of patients needing ventilation support. Other than an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), many patients suffered a number of other problems, such as renal failure, cardiac arrhythmia, myocarditis and coagulative disorders.( Huang et al., 2020)",

It is true that the thrombus arose suddenly in a healthy aorta in our case, and that anecdotal similar experiences are reported however two conflicting considerations can be made. First of all, the city of Bologna, Italy, where our case occurred, is in the second region for the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with a single vascular surgery unit for all the metropolitan area, accounting for one million citizens. During the first month of COVID-19 pandemic, 2334 patients were found positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the area, and the number of interventions or consultations for acute limb ischemias was similar with that of the same month of 2019, i.e. 2 cases in 2020 vs. 9 cases in 2019. Second important consideration is that both medical and surgical therapies delivered to that COVID-19 patient were successful, with no recurrences as it usually happens in prothrombotic cases.",
