S-dependent viral entry requires the presence of a primary receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), 1 while the C-type lectins, DC-SIGN, DC-SIGNR, and LSECtin act as attachment factors, promoting binding to a subset of target cells. [2] [3] [4] [5] SARS-CoV S, like other coronavirus spike glycoproteins, contains two leucine/ isoleucine heptad repeats (HR1 and HR2) located in the C-terminal third of the glycoprotein. [6] [7] [8] By homology to other fusion proteins, such as influenza hemagglutinin (HA) and HIV gp160, HR1 and HR2 are thought to drive membrane fusion through their interaction together. HR1 and HR2 from each member of the trimeric spike pack together to form a highly stable structure known as the six-helix bundle. The events following receptor engagement and leading up to six-helix bundle formation are less defined. Viral entry mediated by SARS-CoV S is exquisitely sensitive to compounds able to raise the pH of cellular endosomes. 2, 9, 10 Thus, a pH-dependent component appears to be required for cell-free viral infection mediated by S. However, S-dependent cell-to-cell fusion can occur at neutral pH, 1 and furthermore fusion is not enhanced by acidic pH. 9 Therefore, it appears unlikely that S has a direct requirement for acidic conditions in order to undergo the conformational rearrangements required for six-helix bundle formation, as is seen for other pH-dependent fusion proteins such as HA. In contrast, when cells expressing endogenous, low levels of ACE2 were used as targets for cellto-cell fusion, treatment of the S glycoprotein expressing effectors with trypsin is necessary in order for efficient fusion to be observed. 9 Thus, we hypothesize that in order for efficient cell-free virus infection to occur, similar proteolytic activity is required, and that trypsin mimics the activity of a pH-dependent cellular protease, hence explaining the sensitivity to compounds able to raise endosomal pH.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 260, "end": 261, "text": "1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 393, "end": 396, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 397, "end": 400, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 401, "end": 404, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 405, "end": 408, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 580, "end": 583, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 584, "end": 587, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 588, "end": 591, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1118, "end": 1120, "text": "2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1121, "end": 1123, "text": "9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1124, "end": 1126, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1347, "end": 1348, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1827, "end": 1828, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "The precise requirement and role of glycoprotein processing for coronavirus entry and membrane fusion is not well defined.

Lentiviral pseudovirions can be prepared incorporating either SARS-CoV S, or its receptor, ACE2. 13 The two sets of particles are then mixed in the presence or absence of proteases in order to study the requirements for activation of S glycoprotein's membrane fusion potential. In order to quantify intervirion fusion, the ACE2 bearing virions package luciferase as a reporter gene, while the SARS-CoV S enveloped particles lack a reporter gene, but co-incorporate the envelope glycoprotein from subgroup A avian sarcoma and leukosis virus (ASLV-A env). Following mixing of the two viral populations, the particles are plated on HeLa cells that lack ACE2, but stably express the ASLV-A receptor, Tva. Thus, ASLV-A env will mediate infection of these cells by the dual ASLV-A/SARS-CoV S particles. Only if S has mediated intervirion fusion with ACE2 expressing particles will the cells be transduced by the luciferase reporter gene encoded by the ACE2 particles. Hence, luciferase activity acts as a direct measure of intervirion fusion. In addition, in order to prevent uptake of mixed virions into endosomes and subsequent activation of S by endogenous proteases, the target cells were pretreated with leupeptin. As a consequence, mixing of the two populations of virions led to no resultant luciferase activity in the HeLa cells (Fig. 2B) . In contrast, if, after mixing the two populations of virions, samples were treated with either trypsin or recombinant cathepsin L, efficient transduction of target cells by the luciferase reporter gene was observed (Fig.2B) .
